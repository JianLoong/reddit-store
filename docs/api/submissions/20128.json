NAH, but you two obviously need to talk about this.

His thinking his family's feelings are more important than YOU/**THE BRIDE!**", "You're not being unfair; he is. And he's a jerk for dismissing your feelings about it. Your family WILL be hurt if you follow through on his plan. I'd consider putting the elopement on hold until you sort this out. NTA.", "NTA. Tell him guess we'll be saving for that big wedding where everyone can attend anyway. But also he's one hell of as a hole to pull this on you. Think if you still want to marry him.

That really defeats the purpose imo. All or none.", "NAH. But honestly it sounds like you should do a big family wedding if family is so important to you and it doesn\u2019t have to be an expensive affair.

Why dont you invite them? 2) Both of you should be supportive to the other. He wants his family there.

You will need witnesses. so take that as you may. I'm not sure what courthouses allow for wedding parties, but i would assume pretty small groups. \n\nAlso to be pendantic it's not jealousy it's envy. Jealous is selfishness about something you have, envy is selfishness for something you dont have but want. You really want your family there for you, and there's nothing wrong with that. \n\nIt may be better to abide by the terms of the compromise: no family until the joint celebration, or just wait to plan a wedding where everyone can partake. The big issues are if there's things like insurance and stuff that require an official wedding. \n\nAlso my grandparents got married in the 50s. They had a courthouse wedding and small reception at my great-grandmother's house. They were married 60 years. All their kids had big weddings and they all got divorced. Saving up for a big wedding is a waste of money. Figure out a good middle ground between the families and have a potluck to meet each other. For booking places call it a family reunion to get discounts, because weddings get charged more.", "NTA why is what his family would want more important that the bride\u2019s wants and needs at her wedding? \n\nPut this marriage on hold.", "NTA. This is almost exactly what happened with our wedding. We were meant to elope privately here in his country and then have receptions later in both our respective countries that all our family and friends could attend. I ended up caving when he decided to invite his family. My parents did fly over from the US to Australia last minute for the \"wedding,\" but none of my other family or friends were there.\n\nEveryone pretty much insulted or ignored me and my parents on my wedding day in favor of making a speech about my husband and talking amongst themselves about their own family. Then COVID happened and I never got my reception. My husband thinks I should be over it, which really does not justify why he absolutely had to have his family at our wedding when he knew it would be impossible for most of my side to fly such a long distance last-minute. I'm still super salty about it.\n\nDon't let your fianc\u00e9 pressure you into regretting your wedding day.", "That stood out to me as well. Communication is one of the pillars upon which a successful relationship is built. Without it, the relationship will be on shaky ground, if not outright collapse.", "She\u2019s equally dismissing his. If neither got to go and his lives down the street you don\u2019t think they would also be hurt? No one is an AH here, but I do think she shouldn\u2019t allow his family not to come just because hers can\u2019t make it.", "How's she the asshole? They agreed to keep it secret and that's what she still wants to do. It's the fianc\u00e9 who wants to tell his family.", "Think you need to reread this post bud. The poster is the one who isn\u2019t allowed to have their fam there, not the other way around. It\u2019s a NTA to them, but Y T A to their fianc\u00e9", "They had agreed that neither family would be there, and he changed the plan unilaterally.", "She's sticking to the plan they already agreed on; he is trying to change it unilaterally. If one family attends, both families should attend even if it means waiting till you can afford to have everyone there. That doesn't have to be expensive -- maybe everyone gathers at the courthouse for the wedding ceremony and then goes out to lunch on separate checks?", "No, she said they can\u2019t make it. Not that they weren\u2019t allowed. She\u2019s jealous his is close so they can come but hers is too far. Which is her reasoning to not want them.", "Maybe because he realized how big of an event it was and his family lives right next to them. Why should they punish his family because hers is too far? That makes no sense. \u201cIf my family can\u2019t come either can yours\u201d just a very selfish mentality.", "Then do that\u2026but that\u2019s not what she\u2019s saying. She is saying her family is too far and CANT make it. Therefore punishing him and his family by not allowing them. Sure they agreed, can he not change his mind? Can he not realize his family is right there and shouldn\u2019t be forced to miss this event?\n\nIf she wants her family to come, surely work it out, postpone whatever, but if they CANT\u2026why not allow his. They shouldn\u2019t be punished for living closer.", "The point was that it wasn't *supposed* to be a huge event, and it wouldn't have been unless it because a family event. He made it a huge event by renegging on the deal.", "I thought she was saying that her family couldn't make it *now*, but might be able to later with more notice. She did say that she wants to wait until both sides can be in attendance, which implies that would likely be possible at some time.\n\nAnd no, if they agreed, he can't change his mind all by himself. They can change their minds together if they both decide they'd rather do something else, but if he does it all by himself without her consent, how can she ever trust him to keep his bargains?", "No he didn\u2019t\u2026it\u2019s his immediate family. His parents/brothers/sisters don\u2019t make it huge. She said \u201cextended\u201d family is huge. He\u2019s allowed to change his mind, it\u2019s a huge event.", "Well then just postpone and no one is the AH\u2026if he is unwilling then he\u2019s the AH but doesn\u2019t seem to mention that. If she wants to have it now and still doesn\u2019t allow his fam, that\u2019s the only issue i see. He realized how huge of an event it is and his family is right there. I think that\u2019s reasonable. Easy answer is just postpone.", "She said that she'd be fine with postponing until her family can be there, but that if he wants his family there, she'd prefer to postpone instead of having only one side present. He brushed it off because he doesn't want to postpone.", "Makes it seem like she would have waited but will go through with this and just doesn\u2019t want his family there. That\u2019s a semi AH move to me. I get they agreed, but I think his change is reasonable. I\u2019d want my fam there if they were that close.", "I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how she put it. More that he brushed off her feelings about his family going\u2026then IF she knew he was inviting them she would have waited. She truly doesn\u2019t make it seem like she broached that idea with him."]}
