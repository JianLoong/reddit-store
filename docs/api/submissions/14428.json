Now you're committed to what you booked, but you know it's important to her that you strike a better work-life balance, so you intend to book less in the future and certainly wouldn't book on her birthday if you were together.\n\nI mean, that's reasonable, if she chucks a wobbly about it, you probably don't need to be with someone so unreasonable.", "INFO: why are you looking at getting back together if you can\u2019t even have an open discussion about this?", "You promised to play at her party and only told her you wouldn't when she asked a week before!?\n\nIf so - definitely the AH. \n\nBe honest man.", "YTA for not mentioning the other booking when you two are looking to potentially reconcile. That's deceptive and manipulative. Especially if you feel like it's information that would impact her decision to reconcile with you.", "NTA. You handled break up well, by throwing yourself into other activities. \n\nI would suggest not getting back together, until after she has her party.\n\nStart at square one.  Something went wrong with the original relationship.  If you want to try again, consider it like she was never your gf before.  No sense in repeating old patterns.\n\nYou'll probably see the parts that didn't work. And that will help your future relationships", "NTA you were/are single. You made work plans. \n\nYou probably should just tell her though", "NTA for taking a gig on a night that was important to your Ex while you were not together.\n\nYTA for taking a gig that conflicted with a commitment you already had to play her party.  You made assumptions about it feeling uncomfortable, and didn't say anything to her about not following through with your commitment until she asked you 1 week prior to the party.  You broke a commitment and didn't tell her, that makes YTA.  And I'm sure it will come up in your discussions, and rightfully so, she'll probably be upset.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
