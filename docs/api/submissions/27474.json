The teacher asked, your kid said no. Your child needs to learn to listen to someone other than you (the parents).", "I'm a teacher. I work with ELL kids (language learner).\n\nOne accommodation we make is allowing students the use of translations/translation devices. There's a lot of great translators available on phones. However, I never put that in a student's ILP. We have translators and ask the kids to use those instead of their phones. The reason we do that is because if some kids get to use their phones and others don't, it creates a really difficult situation for the teacher to manage.\n\nIt's easy to say oh teachers should follow this ILP and that IEP and the other 504, but y'all obviously have no experience managing a classroom. Teachers have like 6-8 classes of thirty kids, any class can have anywhere from 1-8 students needing accommodation and frankly that's flipping impossible. Teachers are expected to teach two or three classes at once and I really don't understand why that's acceptable, as someone whose job it is to protect the education of my own kids (they should have sheltered instruction but whatever, I'm a bandaid on a gaping wound and to some extent we all are.)\n\nPhone usage and airpod usage are issues WITHOUT giving a few students special permission. Of COURSE there are going to be issues. Of course students will feel it is unfair. That's why I personally try to avoid these situations in the first place when figuring out accommodations (I saw a post where one teacher was upset that one of her students had permission to pace around the room and I felt like the only one who understand her frustration, because it makes it harder to keep the rest of the class seated, and teachers do get in trouble/lose their jobs if their classrooms are rowdy).\n\nBut sometimes it does happen, and when it does, the team has to have a plan. Not the teacher alone, but the team: the SPED team that asks for the accommodation and the admin that requires the teachers to maintain classroom dynamics.\n\n\"Shut up, don't ask questions, and assume there is a good reason for seemingly unfair treatment\" is not a good plan.\n\nI think you should have had a conversation with your kid about your perspective on this rather than just shutting him down, but I also don't think the school set you up for success here.\n\nNTA, the asshole is the American education system but thank you for not making the teacher's life harder and assuming there is a reason for all this, you are probably correct, just have more discourse with your wife and kid about it.", "NTA, the other student is probably allowed to use them per their IEP.", "Nta,  my sons Iep let\u2019s him use headphones", "NTA.

The lot may be different, a prior incarnation of our board may have approved it, it may be in violation but nobody noticed, or it may have been done before that particular code was in effect.  We cannot consider that. We are not cops, or investigators, nor are we zoning inspectors. We have to deal with current code and the matter before us.\n\nJust like it doesn't matter that the other child had in her earpods. As you mentioned, she might have an IEP. I get why your child is upset - it looks on its face to be unfair. It would have been better for the teacher to acknowledge that it looks unfair, but that she can't say why because of privacy. Kids aren't stupid - your child would have got that and not felt unfairly dealt with. Its the unfair thing is why they were stubborn and defiant...just like anybody else would be.\n\nAs to your wife...well this is a communications problem.

It is not my place to dictate how a relationship should be, but there is a universal concept that stands true: when your partner is in the wrong in public, it is your responsibility as a partner to be her protector, her unwavering pillar of support. This means establishing trust and assuring her ( through action ) that you will always have her back, regardless of the circumstances. \nPersonally, even if I disagree strongly with my significant other in public or with their actions, I will still defend their point of view and stand by their side; this is the oath I swore, this signifies that I trust their judgment and support them above anyone else. ( and who knows maybe she saw a red flag you didn\u2019t ). \nIf you have any disagreements with a partner's stance, you must address them privately and in a safe environment, away from prying eyes. \n\nNevertheless, it is CRUCIAL to never take someone else's side over your partners, as it is your mission, duty, purpose, and responsibility as a husband to establish a foundation of trust, reliability, and unwavering support. Then continuing to prove it in times like these; to cast aside any form of doubt she or your family may have in your abilities. To prove to yourself and your family that no matter what the situation is they can rest assured because YOU are there. \n\nTo take another\u2019s side over your partner implies the opposite of what\u2019s stated above. Even if that\u2019s not what your intention is. Even if you truly believe you MUST take the other side, you cannot ignore the natural interpretation that very action suggests. \nThis is simply my perspective, and I acknowledge that each individual may have their own approach to relationships. This approach for me helps me see how I should conduct myself in a relationship.", "YTA - You support your partner then and there, then discuss and apologise later if need be.

To elaborate on the first half of my stance, I don't believe that standing up to teachers is inherently wrong. Everyone here is saying \"oh, the teacher shouldn't have to reveal another student's disability to this kid\" or whatever, but if that was the reason then all the teacher needed to say was \"they have special permission for personal reasons\" and that'd be fine (if the kid kept arguing past that, then once again N T A for siding with the teacher), but it's absolutely possible that a teacher just likes that other kid more or dislikes this kid in particular and is being unfair to them, in which case asking why the rules aren't seeming to be enforced equally is a perfectly reasonable thing for a kid to do, teachers aren't infallible or perfect moral pillars at all times - I'm speaking from very real experience here.", "i had a 504 plan in high school to help deal with my anxiety and one of my accommodations was always being allowed to listen to music in class. i knew some kids questioned it or resented me for it but it was none of their business and i needed my music to soothe myself enough to interact with others.", "NTA.
