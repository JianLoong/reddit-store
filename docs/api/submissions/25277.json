We will call his girlfriend \"Paige\". Paige moved in with us about a year ago, since her parents wanted her to pay rent. \n\nNow, we have 2 bathrooms, one with a shower and one without. Since moving in, Paige has made it very clear that she doesn't like the smaller bathroom. She would rather wait until the person is done in the larger one then use the smaller one. Whatever, I don't really have a preference so I usually use the small one to prevent drama. \n\nAnyways, a couple days ago I had just come home from a long run and I was gross and sweaty. As soon as I got into the house I went to the larger bathroom to go take a shower. Everything was fine until I hear banging on the door. Mind you, I am mid shower, fully naked and covered in soap. I ask the person banging what they want and Paige answers 'Let me in, I have to pee'. I am shocked, and ask her 'is the other bathroom being used?' She sighs exasperated and says 'just fucking let me in!' I tell her no, that she can either use the other bathroom or wait.\n\nShe starts banging on the door and cursing me out, and this goes on for about 5 minutes. I just tune her out and continue my shower. When I was done, I just assumed she relented and used the other one, but was met with a warm, wet surprise when I stepped into the hallway. Paige had pissed on the floor and didn't even clean it up. \n\nI'm angry now, not only did she harass me while I was showering but now she left a disgusting mess that could have been avoided if she just used the other bathroom. I stormed to her and my brothers room and we got into an argument, the gist of it being 'this wouldn't have happened if you just opened the door' from her (and later my brother) and 'you were invading my privacy and left a big gross mess'. \n\nPaige ended up telling my parents everything except the pissing on the floor part. They were already on my side to begin with, but when I told them that final detail they were livid. They almost kicked her out, but after they calmed down a little they told her that she'd have to find somewhere else to shower because she was no longer allowed the use the big bathroom. \n\nNow my brother is not talking to me and his girlfriend is telling everyone that I was a manipulative asshole who almost made her homeless.

I don't need more stigma added to my disorder when I'm trying to seek help for it. people with NPD are not evil demons, they are people that struggle too.\n\nobviously if someone's acting completely hellish that needs to be dealt with, but slapping \"evil person disorder- how to beat them down once and for all!\" onto them doesn't help anyone get better. no empathy there or compassion.", "TY for the compliment lol.", "Sorry about that.\n\nThe only other experience I have with narcissism was not with somebody with a diagnosis\u2014as far as I knew\u2014but rather who'd behaviour fit no other explanation. When I learned this and started learning about narcissism it was eye-opening. I'd never both witnessed and understood that kind of behaviour. It was bittersweet because I had perhaps had a blessed life, but that had meant that I was ill equipped to deal with the kind of behaviour I encountered with this person. The resources I used to learn about narcissism was largely targeted to people like me\u2014people who had a malignant person in their lives who behaved in ways fit very well with the definition of narcissism. Whether diagnosed or not, whether actually narcissist or not was irrelevant for the users of these resources because the aim and outcome was undeniably healthy.\n\nGiven it's utility that's why I recommend it. I don't know what an alternative might be. Maybe something like just calling it \"abusive behaviour\"? I like a solution like that because it also helps  continue broadening the understanding of abuse. There must already be some preferred way to address this? Surely we can't just not talk about narcissistic behaviour and recommending that people learn about when they're around abusive people? I'm genuinely curious what an alternative would be.  \n\n\nedit: additional writing...\n\nI forgot that in your first reply you said \"just call it control or abuse.\" The problem there is that those terms each have meaning distinct from narcissism, and that the resources people will find will be different. Understanding narcissism is incredibly useful when making sense of somebody who's acting a certain way. To not use the word... I feel it might not be possible. Narcissism is what's being described. Not abuse, not control, but narcissism. Narcissism can entail abuse and control, but they are compositional aspects of the behaviour and might not be enough to\u2014by themselves\u2014describe it.\n\nAll this said\u2014and thinking about this more\u2014I don't know that destigmatizing narcissism is something that we should do. ~~People aren't openly addressing their narcissism are they? It's never something I've come across\u2014though that's not saying much to be honest. If somebody is diagnosed with NPD~~ (here I remember that google exists and find some material online talking about this. Though I won't read them before continuing, I will read them).\n\nSo... idunno... imho \"narcissism\" describes a complex behaviour that I've seen better way be described. Using one component to describe it doesn't make sense in this case. Also note that I've very carefully couched my original writing in talking about understanding that we can't diagnose somebody, and in all the resources I've found they talk about this as well, and that it also doesn't matter. **If looking at the problematic behaviour through the lens of narcissism is beneficial, then that's what matters.** Remember this is all material for people that are coming to terms with a malicious person in their lives, and it all recommends genuinely healthy courses of action.
