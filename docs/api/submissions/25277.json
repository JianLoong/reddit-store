We will call his girlfriend \"Paige\". Paige moved in with us about a year ago, since her parents wanted her to pay rent. \n\nNow, we have 2 bathrooms, one with a shower and one without. Since moving in, Paige has made it very clear that she doesn't like the smaller bathroom. She would rather wait until the person is done in the larger one then use the smaller one. Whatever, I don't really have a preference so I usually use the small one to prevent drama. \n\nAnyways, a couple days ago I had just come home from a long run and I was gross and sweaty. As soon as I got into the house I went to the larger bathroom to go take a shower. Everything was fine until I hear banging on the door. Mind you, I am mid shower, fully naked and covered in soap. I ask the person banging what they want and Paige answers 'Let me in, I have to pee'. I am shocked, and ask her 'is the other bathroom being used?' She sighs exasperated and says 'just fucking let me in!' I tell her no, that she can either use the other bathroom or wait.\n\nShe starts banging on the door and cursing me out, and this goes on for about 5 minutes. I just tune her out and continue my shower. When I was done, I just assumed she relented and used the other one, but was met with a warm, wet surprise when I stepped into the hallway. Paige had pissed on the floor and didn't even clean it up. \n\nI'm angry now, not only did she harass me while I was showering but now she left a disgusting mess that could have been avoided if she just used the other bathroom. I stormed to her and my brothers room and we got into an argument, the gist of it being 'this wouldn't have happened if you just opened the door' from her (and later my brother) and 'you were invading my privacy and left a big gross mess'. \n\nPaige ended up telling my parents everything except the pissing on the floor part. They were already on my side to begin with, but when I told them that final detail they were livid. They almost kicked her out, but after they calmed down a little they told her that she'd have to find somewhere else to shower because she was no longer allowed the use the big bathroom. \n\nNow my brother is not talking to me and his girlfriend is telling everyone that I was a manipulative asshole who almost made her homeless.
