Henry is a law enforcement officer and had to work on Christmas. We have 2 children - 2 and 4. \n\nI am not extremely close my to in laws. And since Henry was working on Christmas I took the kids to see my family. We spent the day there, they played with their cousins, and had a lot of fun. \n\nMy mother in law told my husband she was hurt we didn\u2019t stop by there on Christmas. He explained he was working and that we\u2019d bring them by next weekend. She argued that wasn\u2019t Christmas and that is her only grandchildren and she missed a holiday because I selfishly didn\u2019t bring them there. My husband is torn because he understands where we\u2019re both coming from. So AITA?\n\nUpdate: \n\nI called my mother in law and asked her to come by the house for dinner with my father in law. The kids were asking for them and they did come by for dinner. When the kids went to bed my husband, my mother in law, my father in law and I all talked. \n\nBasically my mother in law and father in law told me they\u2019ve considered me their daughter and assumed I was coming by because of that and didn\u2019t feel like an invitation was necessary since their family doesn\u2019t send one and everyone just knows to go there unless told otherwise for Christmas. Which is the case. They explained they were just hurt but understood my reasoning as well and that they shouldn\u2019t have assumed. I also apologized. \n\nI then offered that maybe next year they could sleep over our house on Christmas Eve so that they can be here when the kids wake up to open presents from Santa. My husband is also home for that part of the morning even if he has to work. Then we could go to their house after and I could help them and spend the beginning of the day there and then the rest of the day at my family\u2019s house. We all agreed this would be the best solution because our kids are the only grandchildren on that side of the family so it\u2019s easier to get them ready than pulling them away from their cousins at my families house. \n\nWe all agreed it was a big miscommunication that could have been avoided on everyone\u2019s part.

This should have been discussed and arranged with your husband ahead of time and not left on your shoulders.

She's not a parent, and doesn't make the decisions for you.  \n\nHolidays aren't hers.   She ought to be glad to see the grandkids when she sees them, not be demanding she get exactly what she wants.  Many families with small children do not see either extended family on the holidays, but do parties on weekends before or after.  That's normal.  \n\nYou aren't responsible for if she gets hurt at not seeing your children on a certain day.  She sounds rather manipulative, to be making you both uncomfortable about this.   \n\n*He explained he was working and that we\u2019d bring them by next weekend. She argued that wasn\u2019t Christmas* \n\nHer argument is irrelevant.  If she wants to see your family next weekend, she should be polite, not demanding and whiney.  If she keeps on blaming you like this, it would be reasonable to change your plans and wait a few more weeks.  The decisions are for the parents to make, not the grandparents.  I'm a grandparent, and she ought to be more understanding, not so demanding.", "NAH\n\nPerhaps in the future, open dialogue and make plans, so everyone knows what is going on.

She didn\u2019t, so you didn\u2019t squeeze her into the day.   \n\n\nOr she did, and you declined politely, and she\u2019s upset, but she could/should have raised that with her son BEFORE Christmas. By leaving it until after she\u2019s created an unsolvable problem, thus making it a her problem, not a you problem.   \n\n\nIf she had expectations, and didn\u2019t raise them in a timely manner,  but instead expected, or created drama after the fact on purpose, who is the selfish person here?!", "NTA did MIL invite you to come over?", "NAH, it seems like a lack of communication and assumptions by everyone.
