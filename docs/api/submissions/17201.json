We started off as friends but it grew into a beautiful partnership. He's the most understanding and supportive person in my life and one of my biggest priorities as I am his.\n\nI also have this group of friends since high school, I'll give fake names for the sake of the post. It's Rania, Mary and Becky. Ever since I started dating my husband they've always tried to make our friendship vs my relationship into a competition on which is more important to me to which I always replied that I don't like comparing and putting hierarchy on that stuff because each relationship serves a different purpose on my life. I adore my friends and they've been extremely supportive yet I'm not as close to them as I have been to my husband but still I think it's wrong to go to their face and compare the love I have for each of them.\n\nOur families also have this concept of \"family always comes first\" and while our families do love each other, at some points they'd throw in their true perspective of how his family considers me an outsider and my family considers him an outsider and would guilt us into putting them over our partner. All in all people in our lives always tried to make our relationship an importance competition while we never put each other in that position.\n\nSo at our wedding reception during our speeches he called me his greatest love and I called him the most important person in my life and my greatest love. To which our families and *my* friends took great offence.\n\nWe've been bombarded with guilt tripping words from our families of how wrong it is for us to put each other first and consider e/o the most important person and \"tossing our families to the side\". And my friends said how harmful it is for me to lie for so long about not wanting to put hierarchy and compare the loves I have for friends/partner/family just to publicly announce how my husband is my greatest love. Maybe I am ta for putting that part in the speech because it hurt people around me and caused offense and controversy.", "created_utc": 1684063968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h9ug4/aita_for_referring_to_my_husband_as_my_biggest/", "score": 1472, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fam and friends are petty and pathetic. Disgusting people.", "Agreed. When you get married you start a new family. I\u2019d ask your parents if they love/more loyal to your grand parents than each other. \n\nIt\u2019s a weird stance and a hint this might be a writing print.", "I love it when my thoughts are in the top comment.  Well said!", "I guess these people will not be in the \u201ccircle of trust\u201d", "Not just the family- it\u2019s *also* the friends.\n\nNTA.", "The issue is people are always supportive until you start doing better than them, then they work hard to tear you down. OP and her hubby need lots of boundaries and better friends!", "I like this. \ud83d\ude04\ud83d\udc4d", "NTA.  I cannot comprehend how you both surrounded yourself with friends & family who all have this unhealthy emotional hangup.  You might want to analyze why you\u2019ve both surrounded yourselves with people who all share this unhealthy fixation on their place in some imaginary line.", "\ud83d\udcaf agree. NTA", "\ud83d\ude06 love this", "Yeah, as I was reading this, I was like, wait, am I missing something here? Lol. OP is literally a newlywed wife saying how important to her, her husband is. Like, WTF? Should she instead say how he's kind of a cool guy but there are others who are about as important?\n\nThis is just weird!", "that's what I thought, and i think there are three possible explanations:\n1) Op and her husband are one of those weird joint at the hip codependent couples and their families and friends are kinda right in pointing that out. \n2) it's fake\n3) as improbable as it is, OP might be telling the truth and be right", "It's a thing. My husband's mom told him to pick between us and he picked me.", "Unfortunately this is a thing. It's how my dad's family and friends are.", "Big \"look at me, look at our endless love\" vibes here.", "Right? The friends part I might believe it, specially if they were super close and codependent before the relationship but also the family? I don't buy it", "Did OP edit her post or something? I don't see any mention of children.", ">and will soon become the father of your children\n\nYou don't know that.", "This. What did they expect? It's a *wedding*. They didn't want the couple to profess their love to each other? This is absolutely bananas. I hope it's fake because if not, these poor people are surrounded by some real monsters. I cannot fathom ever telling a friend that they should love me more than their spouse. Maximum audacity.", "I'm all...what is she supposed to say \"yeah my hubby is ok but OMG THESE PEOPLE ARE THE TRUE GOATS?\" Like it's a wedding, the bride and groom are supposed to be gushing about love and how awesome their spouse is... if that's not how you feel, then ya really shouldn't be getting married. NTA and boy I feel bad for OPs spouse having in laws like these.", "\" I love less than half of you half as well as you deserve! \"", "I'm figuring the scene in my head and I can't stop laughing now. Thank you", "if things go to plan, your children move out and start their own lives. \nYour spouse will still be there", "Yah, and it's super weird behaviour. NTA", "Your friends are no better.   I have never seen anything like this in my life (and I have been around for a pretty long time).   I mean I have seen asshole family members scattered about that somehow have the assumption they come before a spouse but not ALL family members.  Then your entire friend group is this creepy too?  Is there no one within your close proximity who has a normal functioning brain around there besides you and your husband?  If there are, I suggest you give yourself a special wedding gift of distancing from the weirdos you hang with and gravitate towards them.", "It\u2019s not the idea of someone asking you to choose. It\u2019s the idea of two separate people\u2019s ENTIRE family asking them to choose, despite knowing and getting along with one another for 7+ years AND three other completely unrelated people to OP. \n\nOnce? Believable. Twice? Kinda weird but sure. No less than SEVEN people from FIVE different upbringings? Nah. Unless you were raised in a cult, but OP already said they weren\u2019t.", "They're not saying it's not a thing. They're saying it's unlikely that *everyone* surrounding OP shares that mentality", "This is exactly what I was thinking! \nIt made me think about when me and my sister were young children and used to ask our parents who they loved the most and who was their favourite daughter, or when I was at school and used to have a best friend, 2nd and 3rd best etc\u2026 and would be devastated if someone else called my best friend their best friend. \n\nI just can\u2019t see adults behaving like this and being at a wedding and instead of being happy for the couple, everyone gets upset about sentimental words in the speeches. \n\nIt would have maybe been believable if one of the friends or family felt this way, it\u2019s certainly far-fetched that they all sat there and took offence and then vocalised it.", "Be thankful that you've clearly not been raised by a pack of narcissists.  This shit does happen.", "I..read what they said. I said it unfortunately does happen.", "My SIL's family is like this and it's so weird", "Also, if there is a cultural aspect, that could also explain why everyone in their lives is acting this way. They've been dating since they were 18, and we know her friends go back even farther, which puts us solidly back into their school years. These people likely all grew up in the same community. If the community as a whole has a strong bias against \"outsiders\" it makes sense that both her family, his family, and her friend group have decided that since the relationship between OP and her now husband is the newest connection, it shouldn't be as important as their longer standing connections to their friends and families."]}
