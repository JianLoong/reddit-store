We started off as friends but it grew into a beautiful partnership. He's the most understanding and supportive person in my life and one of my biggest priorities as I am his.\n\nI also have this group of friends since high school, I'll give fake names for the sake of the post. It's Rania, Mary and Becky. Ever since I started dating my husband they've always tried to make our friendship vs my relationship into a competition on which is more important to me to which I always replied that I don't like comparing and putting hierarchy on that stuff because each relationship serves a different purpose on my life. I adore my friends and they've been extremely supportive yet I'm not as close to them as I have been to my husband but still I think it's wrong to go to their face and compare the love I have for each of them.\n\nOur families also have this concept of \"family always comes first\" and while our families do love each other, at some points they'd throw in their true perspective of how his family considers me an outsider and my family considers him an outsider and would guilt us into putting them over our partner. All in all people in our lives always tried to make our relationship an importance competition while we never put each other in that position.\n\nSo at our wedding reception during our speeches he called me his greatest love and I called him the most important person in my life and my greatest love. To which our families and *my* friends took great offence.\n\nWe've been bombarded with guilt tripping words from our families of how wrong it is for us to put each other first and consider e/o the most important person and \"tossing our families to the side\". And my friends said how harmful it is for me to lie for so long about not wanting to put hierarchy and compare the loves I have for friends/partner/family just to publicly announce how my husband is my greatest love. Maybe I am ta for putting that part in the speech because it hurt people around me and caused offense and controversy.", "created_utc": 1684063968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h9ug4/aita_for_referring_to_my_husband_as_my_biggest/", "score": 159, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You are SUPPOSED to put each other first!", "NTA Your family and friends seem to share some weird, competitive dynamics that ultimately feels pretty dysfunctional for a happy marriage.

If they\u2019re so closed off that they won\u2019t fully welcome a member\u2019s spouse how tf will the family last? And at some point in the past, an outsider or two had to be accepted in. What a crappy way to approach a marriage. \n\nI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s a perfect way to deal with people who are so detached from reality. You\u2019re not going to reason with the unreasonable. I hope they all realize the way they\u2019re handling this is pushing you away. \n\nNTA", "NTA - Based on thier reaction I can see why none of them are the most important. I'm glad I don't even know anyone like your friends and family.", "Wtf? NTA\n\n1) You two are the family now. So you\u2019re doing as instructed - putting family first.\n2) Your friends sound very insecure. A long term/married partner always comes before a friend if you absolutely \u201chad to choose\u201d\n3) Your families are yikes. Any future children will be part of both. Sounds folks are sad the children grew up to me. But y\u2019all aren\u2019t Peter Pan.\n\nIf I were you guys, I\u2019d nip this in the bud now that you are officially married. Present a united front particularly to your families.  \n\n\u201cI understand it\u2019s hard to watch us grow up. But while we were dating and young, it\u2019s easy to view the other was more of an outsider. But we are now married. Children grow up and they create new families - together. (And if kids are thing you want then add). At some point, we may have children. They\u2019ll be part of each family, but most importantly ours. If you continue to treat us as if we\u2019re doing something wrong by prioritizing each other, you\u2019ll be missing out on a lot of great moments going forward.\u201d\n\nPS - in families like this, you will never, ever be able to vent frustrations about your partner to them. They will be used as permanent ammunition and grudge holding. Ditto for the friends.

I can\u2019t believe what people chose to get upset over. Your husband is your family now.

This is literally so pathetic which makes it too funny. \n\nNTA, but your friends and families are.", "What the actual fuck?\nOf course your significant other is the greatest love of your life. That's why you marry that person.  You love your extended family and friends too but in a very different way.\nIt was the day of your love. It's totally natural that you focus on the person you are marrying. Just like you focus on your mother on Mother's Day...\nWho the hell calls one out for admiring their spouse on their fraking wedding day?", "NTA because this whole contempt of comparing loves is just stupid. You\u2019re right, each kind of love is different and doesn\u2019t mean that one is more important of the other.

This is so weird. Setting aside that it was your wedding and this is a very normal thing to say at a wedding, the love you have for your romantic partner is incomparable to the love you have for your friends and family, and the fact that a bunch of grown adults can\u2019t grasp they\u2019re not the centre of your universe is mind boggling.
