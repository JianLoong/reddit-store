We started off as friends but it grew into a beautiful partnership. He's the most understanding and supportive person in my life and one of my biggest priorities as I am his.\n\nI also have this group of friends since high school, I'll give fake names for the sake of the post. It's Rania, Mary and Becky. Ever since I started dating my husband they've always tried to make our friendship vs my relationship into a competition on which is more important to me to which I always replied that I don't like comparing and putting hierarchy on that stuff because each relationship serves a different purpose on my life. I adore my friends and they've been extremely supportive yet I'm not as close to them as I have been to my husband but still I think it's wrong to go to their face and compare the love I have for each of them.\n\nOur families also have this concept of \"family always comes first\" and while our families do love each other, at some points they'd throw in their true perspective of how his family considers me an outsider and my family considers him an outsider and would guilt us into putting them over our partner. All in all people in our lives always tried to make our relationship an importance competition while we never put each other in that position.\n\nSo at our wedding reception during our speeches he called me his greatest love and I called him the most important person in my life and my greatest love. To which our families and *my* friends took great offence.\n\nWe've been bombarded with guilt tripping words from our families of how wrong it is for us to put each other first and consider e/o the most important person and \"tossing our families to the side\". And my friends said how harmful it is for me to lie for so long about not wanting to put hierarchy and compare the loves I have for friends/partner/family just to publicly announce how my husband is my greatest love. Maybe I am ta for putting that part in the speech because it hurt people around me and caused offense and controversy.", "created_utc": 1684063968, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13h9ug4/aita_for_referring_to_my_husband_as_my_biggest/", "score": 696, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
