{"id": 3873, "submission_id": "zbqmer", "title": "AITA for telling my SIL that her pregnancy announcement hurt me?", "selftext": "I\u2019ve had cancer twice in the last 4 years and have lost the ability to become pregnant as a result of having a radical hysterectomy during my last diagnosis. This is an incredibly difficult reality to accept and, even though my husband and I hope to start a family via surrogacy, the pain is still deep and real. \n\nRecently, my SIL invited our family and her new boyfriend over for dinner. She does this sometimes so there was nothing unusual about this. She had an early bday surprise for my father-in-law she wanted to do privately as a family, so when my own mom made an impromptu visit to my house that day I told SIL I would wait to show up a little later with my mom so she could do the surprise in private with her parents and my husband.\n\nWhen I arrived everything seemed normal, so I didn\u2019t ask about the surprise. Before we sat down to eat SIL says to me, \"BF got you something\", and she pulls out a box from a drawer for BF to give me. \n\nI thought it was odd that her boyfriend of just a few months would get me a gift for no apparent reason, but thanked him and asked if I should open it, and they both said yes. \n\nEveryone gathered around to watch me open the gift. When I opened the box there was a baby teether, a onesie and a framed ultrasound picture. \n\nI\u2019ve never been more confused in my life, but then it dawned on me. \n\nI summoned the most sincere smile I could and said congratulations as I hugged SIL and BF. But I wanted to break down in tears and run out screaming. Worst dinner of my life. \n\nReceiving a picture of her at her ultrasound in the family group text the next day only rubbed more salt into the wound. \n\nAfter 2 weeks of crying and deliberating whether I should tell SIL how the situation made me feel, talking with my therapist, and a very uncomfortable Thanksgiving family gathering, I finally decided to share my feelings with SIL in person. \n\nI let her know that choosing to share her pregnancy news with someone who cannot conceive or ever become pregnant in the way that she did was insensitive, upsetting and humiliating. \n\nHer response was, \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry you feel that way because that wasn\u2019t the intention\u201d. It didn\u2019t feel sincere, in fact, it felt invalidating and more hurtful. She said that I made her and her BF feel super uncomfortable at thanksgiving like they did something wrong, and that she shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for getting pregnant.\n\nI felt completely misunderstood and, to add more insult to injury, she said that after everything she\u2019s been through (two difficult breakups), she thought I \u201cwould have the capacity to hold space for her.\u201d\n\nNow the family is involved and my mother-in-law is devastated by the situation. Even though my husband and I both talked to MIL about things and she understands why I feel so hurt, it still feels like I am responsible for turning things upside down and ruining our family dynamic. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? Should I have just kept quiet?", "created_utc": 1670101418, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zbqmer/aita_for_telling_my_sil_that_her_pregnancy/", "score": 342, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The loss of your ability to have children is devastating.\n\nYour in-laws were so callous and I can't believe that they honestly thought that was the best way to announce to you - knowing what you've been through and acting upset that you are not able to put your feelings aside and be happy for them.  That shows a complete lack of tact and empathy for you and your husbands situation.\n\nMy heart goes out to you.", "NTA from reading the above, it was the way she did it - presenting this box with baby things in from of everyone - I would be pretty upset too.  I will ask though - if you had just been given this news verbally in private, would you still be so upset about it?\n\nThe fact is other people are going to have kids. You need to focus on what you do have and not on what you don\u2019t have.", "Info.....had she told everyone else before you got there or did she deliberately wait for you to get there to open that gift as her announcement to everyone?", "INFO: Everyone is assuming you're the only one who got a gift but I'm guessing everyone got a similar gift before you arrived. Is that correct?", "NTA\n\nI really wonder if all the Y-T-As have read the part about you being made the center of the entire thing.\n\nSingling out you to open that box is putting you on the spot for no good reason, and it's reasonable to expect her to be more sensitive around you.\n\nHad she simply announced it in a group, then you'd sadly have to just take whatever feelings you got from it. But it's entirely reasonable to expect her to not actively putting you on the spot.", "INFO\nI need to know if everyone got that gift with the framed picture or not. Because if all of them did then she did nothing wrong. In that case you weren't singled out but received the gift \"alone\" since you were late. I can't really give any judgment until you answer that OP", "NTA It\u2019s recommended that you share pregnancy news with someone struggling with infertility or loss over text so they have the opportunity to feel their feelings in the moment and not force them to perform happiness. She may not have been malicious but she was thoughtless/tactless.\n\nOn a separate note, it was a super weird gift/announcement. Not sure why you would give someone else a pacifier, onesie, and ultrasound picture, that\u2019s more of a way to tell your spouse or social media that you\u2019re pregnant, not your SIL.", "I\u2019m shocked by the responses here. NTA at all. I do not see any indication you\u2019re mad she got pregnant, just that she announced in a bizarrely hurtful way. The announcement style was odd (people who do the onesie gift usually have the grandparents open it not the SIL especially not one who is infertile due to cancer and why did her boyfriend give it to you?!). I can\u2019t imagine announcing my pregnancy in that way to someone struggling with infertility. I\u2019d think it could have been naive but she gave a non apology when you let her know how hurtful she was.", "I can\u2019t really judge this fairly. You are absolutely 100% right in your feelings, and I hope most people would be sensitive enough not to announce the news to you in this way.\n\nAt the same time, some people are just - tactless but well meaning? Thick but not heinous? Some people just seem to be missing whatever it takes to realize that this could be hurtful. I am not sure if a sit-down with flash cards and one syllable words can get it through to them. I got told by my MIL it was so great we didn\u2019t have kids, so we could look after them in their old age.\n\nYou know what? I love my MIL and *do* look after her in her old age. She\u2019s just missing part of her sensitivity filter. \n\nI hope you find a happy future with children of your own, even if you didn\u2019t give birth to them. I hope you also find happiness and room in your heart for your upcoming family member - it sounds as if you are the sort of person who will be able to. I hope you reach peace with your SIL.\n\nWarmest wishes to you.", "Did your SIL already know that you couldn't conceive after the cancer treatments? If she knew, and expected to surprise you with her news in a way that makes YOU the center of attention, then she's SUCH an AH. She should have warned you separately ahead of time so you could react in private and get your game face on - and there was no reason to make you part of the spectacle.\n\nIf she didn't know (have you been very private about your surgery?), then it's still a weird, self-centered announcement, but maybe not malicious.\n\nI'm sorry for all the Y T A judgements you're getting - you are NTA for having emotions and expecting your SIL not to use you as a prop. She's really kind of rubbing your face in it and then blaming you for not performing the correct emotional response for her.", "INFO: are you the only one who received the box?", "I am inclined to say NAH, though SIL's approach was hurtful, I am not sure if it was intentional. Your feelings and boundaries in the situation are obviously not A-hole behaviour either!", "NTA\n\nThe way she revealed was completely insensitive and deliberate.\n\nShe had a family dinner to which you had *already* announced to join late, with your mother, mentioning you are giving her time to share whatever surprise with her family and your husband. \n\nShe didn't do that. She deliberately waited for you to come along, then handed *you* the ultrasound picture. That's gross. Out of everyone that could have opened the surprise, it had to be you. \n\nIt's very good that you found the courage to share your feelings. You have a good therapist. It's not your fault that this girl is either mean or just plain stupid. It's good your family understands and you have some support.", "Okay I\u2019m trying to be charitable here. \n\nIs it possible that the SIL thought that she was sharing something special with you, like, \u201cyou may not be the one pregnant but please share in this joy with me and be the bestest auntie!\u201d\n\nI\u2019m not saying that this is right but it may not have been malicious. She may have genuinely thought you\u2019d be excited to play some role in the pregnancy.", "Sincere (not retorical) question, is there a way she could have shared this news that wouldn't have brought up those feelings for you? Within 2 months of my miscarriage I'd received 4 different pregnancy announcements, one in person, one in a staff zoom meeting, and 2 through Facebook. Each one was a heartbreaking reminder of what I had lost. I honestly don't think there would have been a way of telling me that wouldn't have brought up those feelings, but everyone's experience is different.\n\nI'm unsure of my judgement here. If her announcement to everyone hinged on you opening your gift while everyone else looked on then you're NTA. It would be bizarre for her to single you out like that. On the other hand, if she had already announced to everyone else and you were singled out because you arrived later, I'd lean towards NAH/ESH. It's understandable that she wants to share her news, and also understandable that you aren't in a place to hear it graciously.", "So.... how do you think she should have told you that you wouldnt feel this way? Is there a way that you would not have cried for days? Your feelings of loss are justified but expecting someone to cloud their own happiness to tip toe around you isnt right either.", "NTA\nI don't think it was wrong of you to point out to your SIL that her announcement was hurtful for you and why. Especially since it was creating an uncomfortable atmosphere.\nYou being hurt by the way she told you, doesn't mean you can't be happy for her. Those are 2 seperate things.\n\nI would have gone N A H, because I don't think her intention was to hurt you, but \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" is not an apology. It puts the blame on you for feeling hurt.", "OP, to start off, I am so sorry for everything you have had to endure.  Very few people truly understand the painful reality you have to live with.\n\nI hesitate to call anyone an AH in this situation, but I do tend to feel that you maybe overreacted.  \n\nIt sounds like your SIL just wanted to include you in the happy news, because you are family.  It doesn\u2019t seem like it was to intentionally hurt you.  This announcement wasn\u2019t about you.\n\nThat being said, I understand on some level where your feelings are coming from.  I have been through infertility and miscarriages.  It makes you extremely sensitive to pregnancy-related issues around you.  No one understands unless they have been through it themselves.\n\nI don\u2019t think there are any AH in this situation, your heart is just really hurting a lot.  If your SIL had intentionally left you out of any announcement or festivities regarding the pregnancy, you probably would have been hurt by that as well.  There\u2019s no easy way to walk through what you are experiencing.", "Info : did SIL know about you not being able to have children?", "NTA. I was ready to say Y T A based on the title alone, but after reading HOW they went about it while knowing your medical situation, they are 100% in the wrong. There are better and gentler ways of sharing that kind of news with someone who has fertility/lack of fertility problems, SIL was just straight up tone deaf and callous. \n\nAnd you're right, her apology was NOT sincere. Any apology that goes \"I'm sorry you feel that way\" or \"I'm sorry BUT\" is NOT an apology.", "\u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel/felt that way\u201d (TM)  is the most condescending, garbage, apology in the human language.  Your SIL is treating insensitivity like it\u2019s an Olympic Sport and she\u2019s vying for the gold medal.  Just go radio silent, drop the rope, and let her have her time in the sun.  Anyone starts with you remind them you are literally still healing from the physical and emotional beating you took when you lost all ability to carry a baby to term,  and if they can\u2019t respect that they can go join SIL in her play to be center of the universe.", "NTA", "NTA due to SIL I sensitive announcement method, and laco of sincere apology.", "NTA. She really had to make *you* be the one who opened the damn box? I feel like everyone is overlooking that.\n\nOf all people at the family dinner (in-laws, etc.), the person that SIL wanted to make a spectacle around was the person who was rendered infertile from multiple rounds of cancer.\n\nAt best it\u2019s a severe oversight on SIL\u2019s part, but at worst it\u2019s downright evil. I\u2019m so sorry OP.", "NTA I was so prepared to call you one but the way she made her announcement way thoughtless. Why you? Why not the MIL? And I can appreciate that you went to her after thought not reacted in the moment. And I know that moment was hard and painful. Her reaction seems out of line, I understand she is excited and that\u2019s fine but she sounds to be thinking in a very selfish way at the lament. I hope it turns around.", "I'm sorry, but YTA. I get what you're going through though, I'll never have children cause I can't make healthy ones. And I'm jealous, or at least I used to be, of women who can and whom I felt were less deserving, because of my pain. They're not any more or less deserving than you or I. But you, nor I, have absolutely no say in how happy anyone can be about a pregnancy. Just because we can't, doesn't mean they shouldn't. I understand it hurts, but it's not insensitive or assholish. They got lucky, we're lucky in different ways. I wish you all the best.", "NTA at all. They had you open it and her so called apology was too insincere. Who does that and thinks it's alright?", "I guess the whole f'ing world revolves around you and your feelings\n\nYTA", "I'd say ESH\n\nYou shouldn't expect people to not get preg/announce it. But because how they went about it Feel like it was definitely malicious.\n\nIf they told everyone with a surprise cool, but they specifically handed it to you. Very salt in the wound 'look what we can do but you can't feeling. That is the thing I find disgusting on their part.\n\nI have a feeling you may have felt less attacked if they just said to the whole fam they are expecting.

Why not her in laws, who sound like they found out before you arrive? Or her brother or mom? \n\nShe may not have done it with bad intentions but her announcement was insensitive towards you. I am sorry you are going through this.", "NTA", "YTA!!", "I\u2019m shocked by all the Y T As. That was an incredibly cruel way to share the pregnancy news with you. You are absolutely NTA.", "NTA. The presentation of the announcement only to you was malicious at worst, and obtuse at best.", "NTA. Your feelings (and your husband's) are very valid. You have been through so much. She needed the feedback about how this made you feel. What she did likely wasn't intended to hurt you, but the way she presented it and has continued to handle this is in extremely poor taste. She is absolutely not being mindful of how this came across and how you feel. For that,  she is the giant AH in the situation.", "NTA\n\nI honestly don't get the Y T A judgment. Who decides to gift someone they know is struggling with infertility a box with an ultrasound and a pacifier, especially in front of everyone? This is, at best, outright inconsiderate, at most cruel. Especially you being the only receiving at that moment and the spotlight on you. \n\n>choosing to share her pregnancy news with someone who cannot conceive or ever become pregnant in the way that she did was insensitive, upsetting and humiliating. \n\nThis is exactly right.\n\n>she said that after everything she\u2019s been through (two difficult breakups), she thought I \u201cwould have the capacity to hold space for her.\u201d\n\nThis is a weird things to say, like have a battle of who had most pain and who is allowed to have feelings.", "ESH. Yes, you\u2019ve had a bad run, but that doesn\u2019t mean people have to tailor their pregnancy announcements to suit your needs. Your SIL was allowed to share this moment with you and was allowed to assume you\u2019d be happy for her. Did she have to share it exactly the way she did? No, probably not. It\u2019s all an unfortunate series of events but it\u2019s time for you to move on with your life.", "ESH. While I understand your pain and you have a right to be upset, it's rude of you to expect people to never mention pregnancy around you just because you can't do it. Not to mention causing a scene about it and you ultimately are making your SIL feel guilty for sharing the news.\n\nPlus, it's your SIL, so of course they're going to want to share the news with family.\n\nHowever, as another commenter pointed out, it was weird for them to specifically go \"A gift just for you!\". That leads me to ask, did everyone know about it? Or did they announce it via that way?\n\nEdit: Judgement, added stuff.", "YTA, you spoilt their baby surprise and made it all about you and continue to do so.", "YTA. I hate to say it given that you are going through an incredibly upsetting time right now. But it would be more accurate to write, \"I felt hurt by the pregnancy announcement,\" than, SIL's \"pregnancy announcement hurt me.\" While you cannot control your feelings, your SIL is not responsible for them either. And in this case, her announcement was not at all abnormal or over the top.\n\nYou need to get some therapy so that you can better deal with your feelings.", "NTA. SIL sounds really full of herself. I think the next 9 months will be insufferable.", "I am so sorry for your situation which sounds tragic. I am so sorry for your loss. \n\nBut \u2026. Your tragedy doesn\u2019t get to upstage another\u2019s blessing. \n\nPeople don\u2019t lose the right to have kids and be happy bc you can\u2019t. \n\nI hate to say this bc I know you are sad, but YTA.", "Yta....its not fair that women in your situation have to go through this yet at the same time it isn't ok for you all to get mad when people make birth announcements....you are feeling like everyone needs to stop living their life because of your issues. Just stop. No one needs to pull people aside for private announcements no one needs to hide their life joys because of others sadness. Just stop. This isn't about you and how you feel this is her moment and you can't take that from her because of what you're going through.", "NTA for your reaction to the 'gift' you are a much stronger person then me. I wouldn't have been able to hold back the tears through congratulating them. \n\nI think you handled the situation with so much grace. \n\nThe sil - does she have a history of doing shifty things like this? To single out YOU from all the other family in the room for that kind of gift was premeditated and cruel.\n\nWait.\n\nINFO - did everyone else get a little gift like this before you got there?", "INFO: How long ago was the hysterectomy? There's a pretty solid difference between six months and three years, that would flip it between N T A and E S H for me.", "NAH - It\u2019s just a difficult situation all around. Your SIL is happy about her pregnancy and wants to celebrate it with her family. Unfortunately, you aren\u2019t able to celebrate with her at the moment for a very real and valid reason. Her news would have hurt no matter how she told you\u2026although she could have been more sensitive in her delivery. Maybe told her brother first and had him tell you in private. Either way, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re going through this. Don\u2019t be afraid to take some space from your SIL for a little while if it\u2019s too painful to watch her go through her pregnancy. It\u2019s okay to prioritize your emotional well-being here. The family will be okay in time.", "NAH. Your feelings are valid and I'm sorry you got hurt.  Sometimes it is easy to forget someone is in pain when experiencing joyful news. Your Sil probably was blinded by her happiness and and wanted you to share in her excitement. I'm sorry you can't have kids. The pain must be hard to deal with. Perhaps a support group for infertile women could be of some help. Be the coolest aunt on the planet when this baby comes.", "NTA... How come your SIL give you that kind of gift? You acted very civil. I'd have left the gathering in that moment.", "NTA. The way in which your SIL chose to announce was insensitive, to put it mildly. She could have just used her words to announce the good news.", "very much NTA. she doesnt have to hide her being pregnant, but giving you a gift that includes items you will never be able to buy for your own baby, making you the centerpiece of the announcement despite you giving her the time to surprise your in laws and tell you in a more sensitive way... it all feels deliberate and i can see why it would upset you.", "YTA.  I get it.  I really do.  I had a hysterectomy at a young age due to ovarian cancer.  I was devastated to lose my fertility as we wanted and had been trying for more children.  I was more devestated about the loss of fertility than the cancer which was the second time for me in 18 months.   You should have kept this to yourself.  It is not sil fault you cannot have children and it was appropriate to include you in the announcement.  She shouldn\u2019t have to walk on eggshells for being pregnant.  That is terribly unfair.", "Gentle YTA given the circumstances. It's certainly heartbreaking what you've been through and it's totally valid that you feel the way you feel as it's clearly very raw for you, however, pregnancy is part of life so its difficult to avoid. SIL is excited about her own pregnancy as she has every right to be. You shouldn't have made her feel bad or tried to guilt her. It was right to talk to your therapist and your husband but you should have let it go with your SIL.", "NAH.  I'm sorry for your loss and your feelings are 100% valid.  It is natural to feel pain around this topic after what you went through.  That being said, SIL is also allowed to share her pregnancy news in her own way.  Her way could have boon more tactful.  However, she did not intentionally hurt your feelings.  Sharing your feelings with her was also ok, assuming you did it respectfully.  Hopefully after some time, she will give more thought about her approach in the future.", "I am truly sorry for what you are going through, but YTA. There will never be a right time in your eyes to make that announcement. That does not mean that others cannot share what is good news for them", "Honestly I\u2019m leaning Nta because it was a \u201cearly bday surprise for fil\u201d, why did she give the gift to op and purposely wait till Op was there? That sounds pretty planned to hurt op. Like how is it a gift, for the person who just found out they can\u2019t have children themselves? That is actually just cruel. I\u2019ve done some cruel things in my life, but never that low. Like that was meant to hurt you and rub it in your face. Nta at all.", "Gentle YTA. People will get pregnant. It\u2019s something you have to deal with. Although to me it\u2019s a weird way of announcing a pregnancy lol, the way she did it.", "I lost my ability to have children at age 26 due to medical problems. It was heartbreaking. \n\nEven when it hurt to see others having children I didn't make it about me. I could feel my pain privately and still celebrate their happiness.\n\nI understand how very much you hurt, but honestly, YTA in this because the rest of the family is of course excited to have a new family member. Your SIL didn't need to hear about your feelings.", "YTA. Listen, I don't say that without feeling for you. I had cancer at 17, and had to have radical surgery which completely obliterated any chance of pregnancy. I understand. But people get pregnant, and that will not change. Again, I'm sorry for what you've gone through, and I truly DO understand, but the world will not stop to spare your feelings.", "I\u2019m so sorry for what you are going through.  Despite that I still think YTA, not for having a hard time dealing with this but for the way you basically accused her of intentionally trying to hurt you.\n\nI think she was being truthful about it not being her intention to hurt or humiliate you.  I think she assumed you\u2019d be happy for her.  \n\nIt would have been ok if you told her how hard it was for you to hear about her pregnancy without grieving for your own situation. You could have asked her to to be patient and sensitive towards you about it.  Instead you got angry with her in kind of an accusatory way.", "I\u2019m really sorry for you situation but gentle YTA. other people are allowed to be happy and want to share with family. \nI was infertile for 15 years and suffered loss. Truly believed I\u2019d never have a child but that didn\u2019t stop me from being happy for other people. Even when it hurt. And wanting to share those moments with family. I know everyone is different but I don\u2019t think she was trying to hurt you she wanted to include you. There are also infertile people who had being un-included too so she really may not have known.", "YTA.  Would her telling you under ANY circumstance be \u2018acceptable\u2019 to you?   You frankly seem upset by the MERE FACT she IS pregnant other than the manner of how anything \u2018went down\u2019.\n\nI\u2019m very sorry for your diagnosis and troubles,  but you purposefully and intentionally robbed her of joy, and you likely seem intent on maintaining a campaign of doing that for the entirety of the poor child\u2019s LIFE.  She didn\u2019t purposefully try to do any such thing to you simply by getting pregnant. That\u2019s what, unfortunately, makes you very much the asshole.   \n\nGet a new therapist.  It\u2019s time to learn not everything and not everyone is all about you, your diagnosis and infertility.", "Sorry but YTA.  The world doesn't stop because you have infertility issues.  You need to be happy for those who can have children.  You were in the wrong here and your therapist should've told you to tell your SIL that you were upset but to also share her happiness in being pregnant.  Share happiness, don't share despair so everyone is miserable", "Going against the grain here. YTA I\u2019m so sorry for your infertility and the reasons behind it but it doesn\u2019t mean everyone else can\u2019t enjoy having a baby. I have PCOS and Endometriosis I\u2019ve miscarried twice in the last two years. I\u2019m also throwing my best friend a baby shower next week. Maybe the announcement could have been kinder and more personal n but she\u2019s allowed to experience joy about having a new baby.", "NTA. The gift may have been okay to announce it to a parent or grandparent, but for anyone else it is just weird. And to hand something like that to someone struggling with infertility is completely out of line. And honestly, she shouldn\u2019t have initially planned for you to be present for the babies g announcement. I think a phone call would have sufficed so you heard it from her first, and at the same time didn\u2019t feel a need to put on a happy face for it.", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t apologizing. Usually, an apology is like \u201cyes-and\u201d in improv - you agree and add to the apology. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, and I will strive to be better. I\u2019m sorry I minimized your pain and was not sensitive.\u201d Instead, your SIL did a \u201cno-and\u201d or whatever the opposite is - she apologized but she reasoned it out. She basically said \u201cI\u2019m sorry you feel that way,\u201d which is the apology you give when you don\u2019t mean it. It feels shallow and forced. And she expects you to just move on from it, when in reality you\u2019ve faced *cancer* and an invasive procedure with lifelong repercussions. \n\nI am so sorry that she sprung this on you in the way she did.

This is an incredibly difficult reality to accept and, even though my husband and I hope to start a family via surrogacy, the pain is still deep and real. \n\nRecently, my SIL invited our family and her new boyfriend over for dinner. She does this sometimes so there was nothing unusual about this. She had an early bday surprise for my father-in-law she wanted to do privately as a family, so when my own mom made an impromptu visit to my house that day I told SIL I would wait to show up a little later with my mom so she could do the surprise in private with her parents and my husband.\n\nWhen I arrived everything seemed normal, so I didn\u2019t ask about the surprise. Before we sat down to eat SIL says to me, \"BF got you something\", and she pulls out a box from a drawer for BF to give me. \n\nI thought it was odd that her boyfriend of just a few months would get me a gift for no apparent reason, but thanked him and asked if I should open it, and they both said yes. \n\nEveryone gathered around to watch me open the gift. When I opened the box there was a baby teether, a onesie and a framed ultrasound picture. \n\nI\u2019ve never been more confused in my life, but then it dawned on me. \n\nI summoned the most sincere smile I could and said congratulations as I hugged SIL and BF. But I wanted to break down in tears and run out screaming. Worst dinner of my life. \n\nReceiving a picture of her at her ultrasound in the family group text the next day only rubbed more salt into the wound. \n\nAfter 2 weeks of crying and deliberating whether I should tell SIL how the situation made me feel, talking with my therapist, and a very uncomfortable Thanksgiving family gathering, I finally decided to share my feelings with SIL in person. \n\nI let her know that choosing to share her pregnancy news with someone who cannot conceive or ever become pregnant in the way that she did was insensitive, upsetting and humiliating. \n\nHer response was, \u201cWell, I\u2019m sorry you feel that way because that wasn\u2019t the intention\u201d. It didn\u2019t feel sincere, in fact, it felt invalidating and more hurtful. She said that I made her and her BF feel super uncomfortable at thanksgiving like they did something wrong, and that she shouldn\u2019t feel guilty for getting pregnant.\n\nI felt completely misunderstood and, to add more insult to injury, she said that after everything she\u2019s been through (two difficult breakups), she thought I \u201cwould have the capacity to hold space for her.\u201d\n\nNow the family is involved and my mother-in-law is devastated by the situation. Even though my husband and I both talked to MIL about things and she understands why I feel so hurt, it still feels like I am responsible for turning things upside down and ruining our family dynamic. \n\nAm I in the wrong here? Should I have just kept quiet?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

How has it up ended the family dynamic?", "I\u2019m going to say ESH but really no one sucks. I\u2019m also infertile, due to endometriosis, and that pain will never really go away. I know what it like to want that and know it will never happen and to be angry about it. I also know what it\u2019s like to feel like the people in my life aren\u2019t being sensitive to that pain. But that\u2019s not what this sounds like to me, it sounds like your SIL wanted to share with you her joy and wanted to make you feel important and essential to this process. Maybe you can\u2019t be that right now. That\u2019s ok. But I don\u2019t think she meant to be insensitive and sometimes that does matter. I think it should matter this time. Because there is going to be a baby, it might not be your baby, but it is a baby. And you\u2019ll get to love it. That\u2019s something. I\u2019ve found so much joy in aunthood.

You are in a tough spot emotionally.  I don't think they were trying to hurt you, likely thought you would be excited.", "It's a tough one. She deserves to celebrate and you deserve to mourn. I gather you had intended the news to be shared without you present and not only were you present but you were the center of attention as part of their reveal. That feels like a deliberate pie in the face moment. Either she's naive and too immature to realize that your mourning wasn't going to be resolved with her own pregnancy or she's gloating. I'm so sorry for your struggle through this.", "INFO - Did SIL know about your surgery and how you were struggling with being unable to conceive anymore?", "NTA but you should let it go. \n\nI think when you tell someone how you feel in these situations it should be about your own closure and standing up for yourself.

SIL was unintentionally insensitive to your situation and you are being insensitive to her situation. It\u2019s understandable that you are going through a trauma and her news is stirring up negative emotions but, you are transferring your trauma onto her hopeful situation by making it about your feelings while negating her positive news. This baby is going to be a part of your life too and potentially be a healing factor if you allow it to be. Yes you\u2019re entitled to feel however you feel but, SIL is not the cause, your internal dialogue is the root. In all actuality, you may never have a child and that might sound horrible but, you could be the greatest, most loving and appreciative aunt in the world and that is a joy within itself.  Life rarely works out the way we imagine it should. The trick is appreciating what you have instead of what you\u2019ve lost or wish you had. Love heals all things.", "I\u2019m seriously confused.

You are not entitled to ruin someone else\u2019s happy memories because you have issues. I\u2019m sorry if\nthat sounds harsh but it is true.  It is horrible you are experiencing fertility issues. My heart goes out to you and I hope you find joy in starting your family in a different way. That being said, stop expecting others to not enjoy life experiences like having a baby because you cannot. \n\nI have experienced trauma and I understand how difficult it can be to work through triggers. My son died and it was terribly difficult for me to see young children for a while.  I never would dream of telling a family member they cannot celebrate their own child. That would be cruel and inappropriate. I know they say misery loves company but come on. \n\n\nSee a therapist and work through your own insecurities and difficulties rather than expecting your family not to celebrate moments they deserve.", "You are definitely not an AH. It seems like you approached it the best way you could. However, someone who has not gone through what you have probably doesn\u2019t understand the depth of the pain you have around this. Particularly if it\u2019s not news you just got, it might not have been something she thought about (not saying that\u2019s right). She really might not have realized how that could make you feel, and when you brought it up it\u2019s possible she felt attacked for being pregnant in the first place instead of just the announcement. It seems like a difficult situation to navigate all around. She probably feels entitled to be joyful about her pregnancy with her family and perhaps defensive if she feels you\u2019re not supportive of that. Not saying this is your intention at all. It seems like you guys need to talk it out a bit more. I think it\u2019s good you said something because it\u2019s important for you two to figure out how to navigate this within your family. She shouldn\u2019t feel like she has to hide or be ashamed, but you also deserve to have your feelings protected as best they can.", "NTA", "A gift to YOU? This is tasteless, tactless, classless, narcissistic, cruel, and shows no empathy or any ability to read the room. I could understand if it was an announcement at dinner or something like that, but this seems personal and targeted. Just reading the title, I was not on your side. After reading your post I did a 180. NTA. Get her out of your life.", "NTA. OMG, how toxic can it get? Speaking as an adoptive mom (two rounds of IVF and nothing), how could someone be so cold? Personally, I would never be in her presence or speak to her again.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not the fact that she\u2019s pregnant or even the fact that she announced that she\u2019s pregnant that is the real issue.

What a bizarre way to announce a pregnancy when considering her parents were in attendance and she isn\u2019t your sister. You were an odd choice to open this package which can only lead to feeling as though it was targeted to you which is callous knowing your circumstances. I think you handled what happened in the moment and later with a lot of class and decorum that her thoughtless ass was not entitled to. This has nothing to do with her being pregnant which is what she wants it to be about. She wants you to be jealous. What this has everything to do with is you being made to feel lesser than, embarrassed, and put on the spot for having to be the one to open that in front of everyone.", "NTA, and I'm a little surprised that since you weren't there, your husband didn't tell her , \"listen, I think a gift of baby things is going to be really tough for my wife to receive given the fact that she can never become pregnant.

The way the news was shared was insensitive but I don\u2019t think that was the intention. Your SIL just excited to share the news and wasn\u2019t thinking of the full picture. It sounds like everyone feels really bad so instead of focusing on who is right and who is wrong, maybe it\u2019s best to figure out how to move forward. Do you want nothing to do with your SIL after this? Do you want to set boundaries regarding what information she shares with you regarding the pregnancy? The ball is really in your court at this point.", "NTA why didn't they just have her dad reveal the surprise.

You told your SIL the impact of what she did - specifically the way she announced her pregnancy through giving YOU a gift, and instead of accepting that and apologizing, acknowledging the effect on you, she blew it off because of HER intent, not thinking outside herself or listening to you.  Intent and impact are not always aligned, and when not and it's acknowledged you can't just wave it off because 'whatever, I didn't mean it like that'.  \n\nYour SIL was tactless in how she announced to you, and then self-absorbed when you went to speak to her about how it affected you.  She needs to think outside herself a lot more.", "NTA. Why would they announce the pregnancy to you that way??? It was so public and why would they give you a box of baby stuff? It just seems so odd and they should\u2019ve told you in private instead, or at least told the whole group together in some way.", "NTA, why can't people just say I'm pregnant? Why are these weird 'gifts'", "I could be wrong, but I think this is likely how they broke the news to the rest of the family - by giving the dad the same \"gift\" first. Then they probably thought it would be fun to repeat it when OP got there. But if OP's husband was there, he should have been aware enough to shut down that idea.", "Right? I'm so confused by that. The party or get together was supposed to be a surprise for SILs dad. So why was this a gift from SILs bf to just her?", "It makes no sense to give anyone that is not actually expecting a pacifier and a onesie. Also, who wants someone else's ultrasound picture except maybe a grandparent. \n\nOP - NTA. This wasn't just someone telling you they were pregnant, this was making you a large part of the announcement. Like everyone just stopped to watch you open a gift, that would be odd to get even if you didn't have any issues with conceiving. It also seems like everyone knew what was in the gift so they were trying to get a reaction from you and then turned around to make you the bad guy. It doesn't even seem like you are upset they are pregnant but more of how they went about telling you. \n\nSIL is also ridiculous for wanting you to hold space for her after 2 difficult break ups but not being willing to hold space for you after cancer and a hysterectomy.", "It may have been a gift to OP *and* her husband (SIL's brother) to let them as a couple know about the nibling.

Why gift to the one who is known to have fertility issues", "It\u2019s bc OP was late that she was the only person to get the pregnancy announcement in that moment, alone. Everyone else had already gotten the announcement.

SIL didn't stand up and announce it, she gave OP an elaborately crafted gift to her SPECIFICALLY", "This is a good point. SIL probably went a bit overboard but she\u2019s allowed to do that, as her news was something she was excited to share. OP\u2019s situation is unfortunate but you\u2019re right, others\u2019 lives don\u2019t revolve around OP.", "This is *exactly* it.

Did she even make any of these weird baby supply boxes for the other family members? Even if she did desperately want to announce it that way, she could have stuck to the grandparents. I'm *baffled* that people are calling OP the asshole for saying that the sharing the news IN THE SPECIFIC WAY SIL DID, *not* because she shared it at all, was hurtful and completely unnecessary.", "Are people not getting that it's very very likely that EVERYONE at the party likely got a similar box, but OP came later so didn't receive hers at the same time.

It feels very targeted at sil.", "If I'm understanding the post correctly, the SIL decided to announce her pregnancy by having her bf give *just* OP a gift with the pacifier and ultrasound pic in front of the whole family at Thanksgiving. Wtf?! That is extremely bizarre to me, from singling out OP to having the gift be from the bf ... I think that alone gives OP a right to say the announcement hurt her.

It allowed me to express my joy for her, but without being put on the spot or uncomfortable.

How is a baby onesie a \"present\" for the non-pregnant OP?  How does an ultrasound picture and a teething ring constitute something for OP?  \"We're pregnant\" is an ANNOUNCEMENT and not a PRESENT and pretending it's a present for OP was beyond insensitive.", "Yeah this is super bizarre. I do not get why they have op a gift. I thought it was a \u201cearly bday surprise for father in law\u201d? Why single out op to give a \u201cgift\u201d? How is that a gift for op? If that\u2019s really how it went down nta for getting upset by it op. But as the parent commenter said, you would be TA if you would\u2019ve gotten upset at the news regardless. I\u2019m sorry for you loss to bare children. But people in your life are gonna have kids and you should be supportive <3 You will have your own kid someday too! I would let this go. If it was just a stupid mistake, try to forgive and forget :)", "You do realize it was only done this way because OP was late and they did the surprise with everyone else already, they were trying to make it special for OP since they probably had something more elaborate that everyone else saw already", "It doesn't matter what they did separately, it was still in incredibly poor taste to do it that way. OP should have been given a heads up in advance.", "Even if this is the case, her husband was there before her right? Why didn\u2019t he interject and say that it wasn\u2019t a good idea? I\u2019m a little confused about my verdict because I feel things are missing. Your comment gave me more questions lol", "My thought exactly.", "So SILs pregnancy is a gift to everyone else?", "I wondered this too. What does OP do with a onesie?", "On other things, I\u2019d agree - but SIL is defending her baby. I think that\u2019s a bit different.

Was SIL going for a an instagram moment?", "I agree, but some people do prefer to find out in person and I don't think it's the responsibility of the pregnant person to manage other people's feelings. Sending a text ahead of time is a nice gesture if you know your friend/family member will prefer that, but you aren't an AH for wanting to announce your pregnancy in person.", "This was after the announcement was made to everyone else though, OP arrived later. It seems likely that everyone got a gift", "Well, I guess it wasn\u2019t specified whether OP is the only sibling of the brother, or if there are others.  If she\u2019s one of multiple other siblings, then yeah that\u2019s would be weird.", "Who cares? It\u2019s horribly thoughtless and self-involved regardless. It might not have been designed to be hurtful but it was done in an awful way and to not apologize after is horrid.", "I get it, it\u2019s just weird that SIL thinks her pregnancy is a gift to everyone.", "I didn't even realize that it was *specifically* for OP and I thought that BF was her brother. Thanks for pointing that out.", "Exactly this! It wasn't the announcement it was the way it was done. Why such an elaborate announcement for you after I assume they shared the news with in-laws prior? It's okay to express yourself, you even waited for a more appropriate setting to discuss how you felt.", "Thank you!!  The way it was done seems cruel and on purpose.  Why wouldn\u2019t she give the box to her brother?", "To me it sounded like sil had done the reveal before op arrived and once op arrived she accounted the news again to her", "The post isn't clear on this but the way I read it was they did tell the rest of the family first, probably with similar or even the same little gift.", "How? For being upset she was basically force to make SIL pregnancy announcement for her?", "Agree - this was OTT - for her parents it\u2019s ok I guess but why for OP? It just seems unnecessary", "My guess is everyone was given this \u201cgift\u201d and had already opened theirs  before she got there.", "Yeah, gotta say that was not thought through for sure.", "After my loss it would sting either way but I always preferred being included and not being made to feel like an outcast. I know not everyone is going to feel the same way nor should they. I just don\u2019t think SIL purposely wanted to hurt her. But idk her maybe she\u2019s evil af.", "Absolutely this. This \"announcement\" given to her only at a table full of people  made no sense at all. It seemed she did indeed weaponize the announcement.", "Very true!", "Totally agree. It seems they went out of her way to single her out in a strange way. If everyone got a gift, or just dad, fine, but SIL did not handle it well at all.", "This is just so strange.  How is hearing that a not-blood relative is pregnant \"special\" for the recipient of the news?\n\nI'm a mom.  When one of my kids or my siblings tell me they are expecting, it will be special for me.  That's it.  Anyone else...it's special for THEM. \n\nIt feels so weird and performative, maybe it's just the instagram/promposal generation.", "No, she was excited to share amazing news and, at most, was too caught up in sharing her own happiness with her closest family members to realize OP would only be thinking of herself and her own issues.", "OP isn't anyone's sibling in the story. This is OP's husband's sister.", "Yeah I hope OP maybe bolds that point. Seems most here are missing that.\n\nSIL is her husband's sister, bf isn't related at all I'm guessing? If there was more relation to her maybe I'd get it. But this is very salt in the wound. I feel for OP.", "It wasn\u2019t. Read it again: OP was late.", "As someone who doesn't want kids and likely can't have them anyway I'd sure feel targeted if someone did this sort of thing. Like what are you trying to shove in my face with that sort of stunt? She isn't even related to either of these people who are expecting if not for her husband.", "Or her dad who's birthday it was? Like it would be weird to give it to your SIL instead of your parents on a normal occasion, let alone when it's your dad's birthday *and* your SIL is infertile.", "I think you are right but that's creasy no one (including the husband) thought it was not ok do it like that: totally unexpected for OP with all of them focused on OP's reaction. If she was given it at the same time the others (or only one box was given at FIL as his birthday present), I think she could have at least guessed what it was before opening the box. And most importantly, the focus would have been on FIL and MIL reaction rather than hers.", "I don:t think she is evil. I think she is clueless. Good people can be assholes.

My guess is everyone had a box to open, or SIL\u2019s dad opened the box and the news was announced. At this point everyone knew and SIL wanted to surprise OP too. Since SIL knew OP was arriving late, she made have made an additional box for her to open on her own. I", "Even if everybody got one, and OP got hers late because of being late, it's tacky as hell for ALL recipients of the \"present\" of \"we're pregnant\".  It's grossly insensitive to OP, but also a lamesauce way to make an announcement of any kind.", "I definitely did until you pointed it out!\n\nThat's exactly how I read it after rereading. Aside from changing my judgement, I also asked if other people knew about the pregnancy.\n\nOne is just downright rude if nobody knew (giving it to OP to open up), the other one is just odd if everyone knew (having a gift like that from BF).", "If anyone is an asshole besides op for her reaction and waiting until thanksgiving to say anything,it\u2019s the husband.  My husband knows me well enough that had we been in this situation, he would have squashed that box giving idea before I got there.", "I might be a little sensitive to the topic. Like my original comment said I suffered with infertility for 15 years and loss two years ago. When I finally got pregnant this year I was made to feel bad for sharing it when other people I knew were having a hard time.  Which is shitty. I am absolutely allowed to be happy and I was careful with how I shared. I didn\u2019t do anything remotely like SIL in op\u2019s story. But other people are allowed to be happy without being made to feel bad. And SIL prob really just is clueless. And honestly like I\u2019ve said I would\u2019ve just let it go. However we don\u2019t know these people so if she\u2019s notorious a d*ck then yeh call her out.", "I think they told bf parents beforehand. For op said they would show up later for sil had a early bday surprise for her father in law.", "Right? I'm so thrown by that. What other meaning could it be for them to give it to the person least related to them as the surprise.\n\nI thought they would give it to her dad as it was hinted at being a thing to surprise him with before that. Which confused me even more xD", "Me too, Ravi, me too. The whole thing is just confusing.", "Reading all these YTA comments makes me so sad D: this poor op. I hope they see this thread. I am lucky to not want kids, though also likely cant produce them. But for people who always wanted it and can't I just don't even know how awful that must feel."]}
