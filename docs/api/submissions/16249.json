I would also recommend that you get ahold of all your essential documents \u2013 birth certificate, Social Security card, passport if you have one, etc. \u2013 and check your credit to make sure your parents haven't opened any accounts in your name.

Sometimes he gets checks that need to be deposited and the best way to do so is for them to be mailed to my house and I physically deposit them.  Sometimes, the best way to resolve an issue with an account is to walk in the door and get it solved face to face. I can only do it if I\u2019m on the account.  I would NEVER take money from him.

I\u2019m sorry this happened, OP. I agree with everyone else- open a separate bank account with no one else\u2019s name on it so only you can withdraw funds. Additional, make sure to keep a regular eye on your credit score to make sure there are no unauthorized credit cards in your name. Lastly, I don\u2019t recommend going to the police the way some people suggest. While morally what your parents did was inappropriate, that doesn\u2019t make it illegal if one of them was listed on the account (highly likely if you had this account open prior to turning 18).
