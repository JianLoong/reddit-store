They should have ASKED.\n\nSeparate your finances immediately, and get it in *writing* that they owe you the money and what the repayment plan is going to be.\n\nThis is totally unacceptable behaviour and you should be outraged.\n\nNTA in any way.", "NTA mate. They only had to ask if they were in an emergency situation but chose to be sneaky about it.", "NTA", "NTA. They stole from you. What would have happened if you didn\u2019t have the money in your account that they needed?  You are their child and they are financially responsible for you, not the other way around.", "Move out, file charges, cut all contact.  NTA.", "NTA if they took your money from your account, and didn't even have the decency to tell you, that's theft.  \n\nYou're right, your dad had three days to tell you, and chose not to.", "Why do you at 18 need/ allow your parents access to your bank account? NTA - get all your important documents together and surely you can block their access .. please some one who is American explain this to me .. re: parents having access to adult kids accounts ..", "NTA my temper would not, im actually angry for you. There is nothing on this planet that would make that ok. If my parents borrow money they ask me first and make a plan to pay back. For someone to take 3 grand from your account and then get mad when you asked why is actually shocking! Really take the advice of others here. Go set up a separate account they can not access", "NTA I think it's more than fair to alert someone you'll be talking money from their account.", "Your parents are thieves and you had every right to react the way you did. They could have asked you for help with a plan to pay you back but instead they stole from you and tried to hide it. We're they hoping you just wouldn't notice? They should never ever ever *ever* have access to you finances again for sure. They're lucky yelling is all you did. NTA.", "INFO: did you find out what it was for?   \n\n\nBased on what you've posted as one other commenter observed the most likely seems to be they fell for a scammer.", "They had no right whatsoever to take money from your account without asking you first. You are an adult, even if you weren\u2019t they still shouldn\u2019t have done it. What did they expect you to do when you found out? And obviously you would. \n\nI\u2019d be furious as well because they didn\u2019t ask your permission, especially as it sounds as though you\u2019d have agreed to let them borrow it. \n\nWill they be paying you back? \n\nPlease make sure your parents don\u2019t have any further access to your accounts, change all your passwords etc and ask them what their payment plan is to pay you back. \n\nDon\u2019t feel awful about it, what they did was totally wrong. NTA", "It sounds like you feel bad about how it went down.\n\nBut the thing is, your parents should have asked you if they could use YOUR money. From the sounds of it you would have said yes to help your family. Instead of giving you the chance to be helpful, they destroyed your trust in them.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "Definitely nta!", "NTA your parents should have talked with you about it before just taking your money. They literally did steal your money so NTA on your text either. I hope they are paying you back and you take away access to your accounts.. don\u2019t ever let anyone have access to your bank account. You see how easy it is for someone to just help themselves.", "You're 18 so go changed your bank asap. A whole different bank from your parents. If that's not possible them open a new account and transfer the money and change all your passwords. NTA. Absolutely do not feel bad. He took $3,500 from you without permission. There is no way he wouldn't flip his lid of you did the same thing to him or your mom. If they needed the money that bad he should have talked to you about it like a man is suppose to.", "NTA\n\nYour parents stole your money.  Yes, you should be angry.", "NTA - this is incredibly wrong for them to just take it without asking. You\u2019re an adult, that\u2019s your money. First off, document everything, your bank statements, texts between your dad and you, etc. I\u2019d talk to them and work out a viable option for them paying you back in a timely manner. If they refuse to do so, I\u2019d look into pressing charges as $3,500 is a large amount of money for an 18 year old.", "NTA. Your parents didn\u2019t bother to ask for a loan. They just went into your bank account and stole funds. Why would this make you an AH? Furthermore, your mother knew about it and expected your dad to break the news. Don\u2019t feel guilty here! Your parents know you make $15 an hr and they felt comfortable taking your money. Do yourself a huge favour and get a new account. Never allow them access to your accounts (of any kind) again.", "NTA I can understand your parents felt shame to ask their kid for money but this situation must be way more humiliating for them. May I suggest you have a stern talk with them (like a parent to their children)? \nAnd congrats on your savings and being financially responsible.", "Your parents likely got scammed. NTA, but they apparently can\u2019t be trusted to have access now.", "You need to get a new bank account that your parents do not have access to. NTA. Then you need to have a yard sale of your parents shit to get your 3.5k back.", "Why in, I\u2019m presuming this is America, do parents have to be on an account with their children? Im in the UK and just set up my 16 year old with his own account that has absolutely nothing to do with me. Im going to get the same ones for my 14 year old so I can put their pocket/birthday money in so to help them learn the value of money.\n\nInsisting a parent is needed for a bank account and worse, allowing them full access, just opens leaves the door wide open for financial abuse. This kid earned that money and the parents had zero right to it.", "Agree taking money from your adult child is stealing. Nta op and they should have asked to borrow not just steal the money without saying anything.", "Honestly, I imagine they're embarrassed and dad wanted the chance to explain in person and hadn't worked up to it yet. He was maybe very stressed and getting the texts stressed him out more, hence mom saying she wishes she hadn't texted him. Also OP asked mom in work and she probably didn't want to discuss it there. \n\n It's a crappy situation and they shouldn't have done it, but given OPs reaction it doesn't sound like normal behaviour for them.", "If Dad was a cosigner on the account then dad didn't steal anything.      \n      \nIt's a tale as old as bank accounts that some 18-24 yr old discovers that the account they've been using since they were 16 has a parent cosigner.  Then it's shocked Pikachu face when their estranged, or very loving,  relative swipes their tax return or their tuition.      \n      \nLPT: open a new account for yourself when you turn 18 or have everyone but yourself removed from your current account.", "NTA \n\nOP\u2019s dad should be ashamed, Be stole from his own child. Telling somebody who was stolen from to have sympathy for their thief is super easy when you aren\u2019t losing anything \ud83e\udd21", "Absolutely. And take all their money out of the one account immediately before or after opening the new one. We helped my nephew do this when he turned 18 so his parents couldn't keep taking his paychecks.", "Same in Australia! At 14 a child is regarded as a mature minor. I have no access to their bank accounts or anything medical. Nor would I want to! \nThe parents are the asshole. Not op. I wonder if op could have the parents charged with theft?", "It's not \"theft\" but it still isn't their money and OP could sue them in small claims court for it", "A friend of Mine was told He needed the birthcertificate or a certified Copy of it to get a certified Copy of the birthcertificate...", "He need to make sure they can\u2019t access his accounts any more. He is an adult. He need his money back NOW! Or press charges.", "Where*"]}
