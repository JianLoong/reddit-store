There are several basic, easy things you can do. \n\nFirst, you need to put yourself in the shoes of a woman on that website. Ask yourself what qualities you offer that would appeal to a woman. Decide on three qualities you believe showcase what you bring to a relationship and highlight them, because while you talk a lot about what you want, you ignore the fact that women reading are interested in what they want, and you need to create your profile with this in mind.\n\nSecond, get new photos, immediately. It is a red flag that all your photos are grainy and hard to see, considering the ubiquity of camera phones.\n\nThird, get rid of the laundry list of things you want in the profile. Instead, put real effort into adding attractive detail about yourself. It isn't \"I want this,\" it's \"this is who I am and what I bring to the table.\" \n\nStart with these upgrades. There is more you can do, but let me know when you have done this and we can keep improving it.\"\n\nThen move onto fitness, dress, manners, etc. Realistically, more a job for your parents, but hey, it would help him a great deal.", "Yeah this dude needs a reality check.

I met my current partner at 36, before either of us was diagnosed with our respective neurodivergencies (AutiHD for me, ADHD for him). I was diagnosed just before my 40th birthday, at the start of the pandemic (juuuust in time to hear actual doctors on TV and the internet talking all about how I didn't deserve to be kept alive if I got COVID because I'm autistic, so that was fun).  \n\nSo I'm very much still unmasking, figuring things out, etc.  \n\nI just hate to see people self-imposing unnecessary limits because they've convinced themselves something is impossible (so often that's depression talking).  If you don't want something, fair, no one says you have to have it.   I know a fair few autistics who are aromantic or aro-ace (aromantic and asexual) and very happy with it. And that's rad. I'm ace/grey ace myself. But not every autistic is either of those things, of course. We're all different. \n\nBut for people who WANT romantic and/or sexual relationships to be so convinced it's impossible just makes me so sad. Especially because, again, that's usually depression speaking. People with all sorts of developmental issues of varying severities are absolutely still capable of having romantic relationships. Hell, I only have half a corpus callosum (it didn't develop all the way), and rather a lot of my brain is squished up against my skull to make room for the giant ventricles left behind by untreated congenital hydrocephalus. I am neurologically fucking weird as hell on top of the autiHD (my brain scans are a sight to behold).  And yet somehow I have maintained a mostly reasonably functional (we have our moments) romantic relationship for almost seven years.  Far from being some unique and special unusually functional level 2 autist, I think I'm more of an 'if this weirdo can do it, anyone can' case.  \n\nAnd yeah, feeling like something you want is impossible, and having people go 'you'll find it someday' when you feel like you're literally drowning without it right now is really, really hard. I know that feeling very well. I'm sorry.  All I can say is we're all on our own paths, our own timelines. I hope that if it continues to be what you want, you find the right person.

I nearly gave up on dating and a lot of other things a bunch of times, and having people tell me \"it will get better!\" often felt more frustrating than anything, like they just didn't know what my situation was. At the same time, especially in retrospect, I can recognize that I was often venting desperation and frustration and was not as ready to give up as I was claiming. I just needed to get my sadness out. I remember more than once completely deleting my dating profile out of a desperate feeling of wanting to just be done with it all, but I would end up remaking it within a day or two. I never could quite give up, and I'm glad I didn't. \n\nI hope that person will be okay. I do truly think he has some things going for him that are not typical of the type of person he seems to think he is. (I'm willing to bet the video he shared is NOT someone at his level since he has a well-paying job!) It just makes me sad to see someone giving up when I don't think they need to.

I only started to question it when I found \"expert\" information saying that autistic people lacked a sense of humor. (Literally, one of my primary obsessions was a popular animated comedy...) It took me a while to realize that a lot of these people are really just guessing and even the \"statistics\" are based on a lot of guesswork and who is actively around to poll.

If you really do want to help, step up and be decent about it.

YTA.", "YTA. \n\nSomeone who is 30, lives at home, and asked for help. Your response was to dunk on the person. Your brother nonetheless. This sounds systemic of a dysfunctional family.\n\nBrutal.", "Yes you are for sure the asshole. Who are you to tell someone they need to overhaul their life? Everyone in life deserves love and happiness, even if they work at Walmart and they are obese. \n\nIt's understandable that your brother may be delusional and cringe, but it doesn't seem like you are being very helpful. Imagine how he must feel if his own siblings have such harsh judgements about him...\n\nYou could have let him down more gently and tried to productively help him rather than pointing out the things he is probably most insecure about. You don't get to determine who deserves love. I am certain there is someone out there for him. \n\n\nAlso, the fact that his feelings are clearly hurt and you are doubling down on your stance. Why not focus on what he can improve? What positive aspects about him can he focus on in his profile? Maybe help him take some better pictures? Maybe help him understand why his paragraphs are off-putting and gross? Help him build better and more realistic expectations to actually help him find a partner?  Who needs enemies with siblings like you.", "YTA. You gave him the truth but delivered it so brutally that all it served was to hurt him rather than help him.\n\nI get it. You aren't his therapist or his life coach. You aren't under any obligation to truly help him. Helping him requires time, energy, and massive amounts of thoughtful empathy.\n\nBut your brother, like many incels, is living in a fantasy world. He is looking for his dream girl.\n\nSome better advice would be something like this:\n\nWhen looking for a relationship, you can't just come to the table with a list of demands. You also need to present what you have to offer to a potential partner. What are the traits you have as a person, what interests do you have that they might share in, what kind of life you want to live, etc. This kind of information clues people into what a relationship with you will be like. Do you have aspirations? Or will you be living with your parents and working at Walmart forever? Do you want to focus on travel, hobbies, your health, building a family, finding a place to establish roots, etc?\n\nWhat you want in a partner, also, needs to be a little more well-rounded. A girl can have all your desired physical traits but might treat you terribly or make you feel bad about yourself. They might not care about what makes you happy. So what else would your ideal partner have to offer to make a relationship with you work well? Kindness? A good sense of humor? Loves animals? Likes art and music? Etc\n\nAnd then, the final step is one he would need to do internally (and not necessarily list on his dating profile): what things is he willing to compromise on? Maybe the physical pieces of his wish list are not as important as being treated well or finding someone who has the same interests. When he goes through this in his mind, it will help him assess potential partners to determine a good fit.\n\nA good working relationship takes time, effort, and thought. A sign of maturity and readiness for a serious relationship is taking the time to really think about it in these terms. This is not an invitation to build out a fantasy life where you can cut and paste some random girl into it to complete the picture. You are coming to it with a vague idea of where you want to go and you are finding someone who has a similar but not identical idea of where they want to go, and then molding a path forward that lands somewhere in the middle so that both people are happy.\n\n\nThe above is a more empathic way of explaining what you were trying to say to him. It is the same information but delivered in a gentler way so that he isn't immediately frightened back into isolating himself in his fantasy life. People tend to hide in their fantasies when they can't handle reality. If reality is too harsh, they shy away from it. Your mom is protecting him, which I can understand, but it doesn't sound like she is taking the time to have these conversations with him either.", "YTA obviously. I can't believe anyone is saying any different.\n\nI guess because he fits the stereotype of a \"neckbeard\" reddit decides he's not a person worth empathy or love. Your brother is lonely and after 3 years of self hatred asked you to help him out and you took a moment of vulnerability to tear him down.\n\n>I looked it over and... damn. His profile has paragraphs of what he's looking for in a woman: skinny, cute, under 30, average to high income, and lives locally. She must be into anime and gaming. The only pictures he's got are grainy selfies or pictures with one or both parents. Mostly our mom.\n\nYes! That is a horrible profile! That's why he asked for help!\n\nWould it have been so hard to remove those paragraphs, give a nicer description of him and his interests/hobbies, get him to dress up, take some nice pics? Ya know, like he asked you to? Or you could just have refused???\n\nDo you actually want him to find happiness or do you like that he's pathetic because you can be cruel?", "YTA, being honest doesn\u2019t mean you have to be cruel. There was a better way you could have approached this situation. Just like your brother could have taken it better", "YTA. There seems to be no hint of kindness for your brother and it's incredibly apparent how poorly you think of him. You could have given him advice about how being romantically interesting to partners comes from a place of confidence and self sufficiency. If you don't have enough compassion for your brother to do that for him then you could have just politely declined to help.

He does need therapy and a life coach, but unless the parents say it, he will never believe it. They raised a person with next to no individual thought processes, it is painful to see it. When his parents dies, he will be lost in the world since he was never prepared by his parents to be independent.", "Your mom is enabling him. You gave him constructive feedback that he asked for and he can\u2019t handle the truth.

Offer to help him get in a better place mentally and physically. You could offer to go on walks with him, to get him out of the house and active, and have an opportunity to chat about his thoughts. He at least needs a therapist, and maybe you can help him get that set up.

The brother sounds immature and exhausting, but there are ways to say things without being cruel. Nobody changed cause they experienced 'brutal honesty'. \n\nLike, surely the goal is to help the brother introspect on what he has to offer a potential partner. To take the focus away from his wants, needs and demands, and think about what he has to offer to achieve his 'wants and demands'. Like, once he starts introspecting this way, he'll figure out eventually that his expectations are unrealistic, nature will take its course and emotional growth will happen... hopefully.\n\nCause right now the brother has gone from emotionally immature mothers boy demanding a bangmaid on his dating profile, to being told by someone he cares about that's he's worthless and no-one will want him (at least that's how his ego will feel it).

If nothing else, I'll say that being a misogynist is always a choice, even if there are other issues that are causing him to be in a dead end low paying job. \n\nAnd i don't understand why your parents have not encouraged him to do better, both in terms of earning and working and in terms of his misogyny. I understand it's not considered cool to live with parents at that age in your culture, so already that's strange and they know it. \n\nSo given all this i don't think you are wrong. But you were an asshole. And clearly so is everyone else in the story. \n\nMy suggestion is to ask your mother, or brother, if they bring it up again, whether he would date himself if he were a woman/ date a woman exactly like himself? And also to point out the misogyny. 30 is not too old to do better, and perhaps you can help them see that he's not going to be able to support himself without them.", "YTA because of how you said it, not because it's the truth.", "Your brother asked. Reality answered. He denied entry. His loss continues. Mom is an enabler.", "It was kind of mean, but \"... told our Mom\".  Poor friggin' Bill.", "That boy needs therapy!", "He absolutely wouldn't, he said so in his profile.", "Idk, imo people are allowed to have dating preferences, they may prefer to get exactly their preferences but be alone for ages than go with someone they have some flaws with sooner", "A wise man once said \u201cyou\u2019re not wrong Walter, you\u2019re just an asshole.\u201d  By that logic, the truth does not absolve assholiness. ESH", "I like your optimism. Maybe you need to raise your standards if this is mediocre. :-D", "My thought too. Like in reality a guy like Dan Conner could get Katie Segal", "A lot more people need that.  \n\nWhen I was over 400lbs (I\u2019m not anymore, mind you) I had to be realistic that the type of woman I wanted was 9.9/10 times not going to want a guy that big.  It\u2019s part of what motivated me (a small part, mostly because I didn\u2019t want to die before 30).  \n\nA lot of people really have this delusion that they can be as picky as they want and they\u2019ll eventually find someone.  Sure, it happens on occasion, but those are few and far between.", "You'd be amazed at how many men out there think that their mere presence in a woman's life is all it takes. They don't need to do anything, contribute anything. Just exist. And the woman has to do all that you described in order to earn their company.", "For me it's like. That's not something I'd ever be comfortable doing. Like I'm family oriented, but it'd be creepy to post pictures on my dating profile with the kids I care about. I don't think it's creepy when other people post their parents, it's just obvious that they're looking for something I'm not.", "he also needs to drop the weight and get buff if he wants a sugar momma....sugar mommas today dont want fluff", "Cool. Post ain\u2019t about them tho", "Not even the goats want him.", "I'm fully aware, but thanks for being the straight man the joke didn't need", "That's the part that looped it all together for me too.\n\nHope his mom is skinny and likes anime, because that's who he's going to be growing old with.", "YTA. While it is the truth and he needed to hear it, you were a dick about how you said it to him. You could have tried to be more constructive in your criticism and not rubbing it in his face", "So YTA. While what you said may be true. There is a way to go about it and this was not it.", "ESH.  C'mon, did you really have to be so blunt with him?  Couldn't you bring him around to the real issues without so casually destroying him?", "I would say YTA but in a good way. The world needs more assholes sometimes and sounds like you were spot on here.", "This isn't real, YTA lol", "YTA because it doesn\u2019t sound like you were gentle with your advice. Sounds like your brother is delusional but it never hurts to be kind. I get where you\u2019re coming from though. Your brother is not a catch and it\u2019s annoying his standards for women are higher than his standards for himself.", "You\u2019re not wrong, YTA. Just like he says in the big Lebowski. You didn\u2019t have to be a dick about it lol. But this is a repost anyway so double YTA.", "Thanks for making me feel infinitely better about my life", "Nothing wrong with him having high standards, but how can he expect the women who meet those standards to not have a similar list? Especially in such a small pool, hot young women who live locally, have high income and like his niche interests. How would he compete with the other guys who want these things in their partner?\n\nHe\u2019s not skinny or fit, he\u2019s not a high earner, he\u2019s not even under 30. What does he think he offers that makes him worthy?", "Seriously, I skip anyone with a laundry list of demands. Sure, you can have a few hard disqualifiers (e.g. smoking) or look for some common values (e.g. someone into health, exercise, and nutrition or career-oriented seeking someone similar). Anyone with a list like OP's brother's isn't someone emotionally mature enough for a relationship.", "I think people who assume psych diagnosis/autism etc. just didn't grow up with a coddled brother. This is often how it goes - they aren't forced to get their lives together and take care of themselves the way their sisters are, and so they end up stunted and incompetent later in life. Because when you have someone spoon feeding you home cooked meals and calling you \"my special baby boy\" until 30, where on earth would you get the motivation to change?", "Knees are too sharp.", "Before quitting gaming, quitting weed should be the first step. It's also a fast and easy dopamine rush (arguably even easier), but it is less active, and makes you sluggish. Once in a while is fine, but every day or every other day is overdoing it. Besides that, it's possible to make friends through gaming, or enjoy it as quality time with friends, but that's less the case with weed (still not impossible). Also, despite not knowing you, having the genuine desire to change and having already acted upon it, as it sounds like, makes you a lot better than most people. Keep your chin up, you can become who you want to be.", "Jack Black could have easily been a classically trained opera singer with his voice, but chose to be fucking hilarious instead, and also started a music school for kids.

There is a lid for every pot or whatever the saying is. But no thin, young, mid to high wage earner is going to be interested in someone who living such a vastly different life! I don\u2019t know how he doesn\u2019t already understand that. Like she will be eating healthy and running a 5 k after her stressful law job and then what\u2026 goes on a date to applebees with someone who has literally nothing I common with her?! How does he picture this working out?!", "I died at \u201c Bill lives with our parents and has worked at Walmart as a door greeter since he was 18.\u201d", "There's dozens of us!!! DOZENS!\n\nlol without joking adult acne is a bitch. I had a completely clear complexion until I was 23. It's mostly hormonal for me, and no amount of skincare has worked. The best I can do is slater foundation with a paint roller on my best skin days and try to pretend life hasn't personally victimized me.", "Pick a new hobby, stop gaming for six months to break the cycle and replace it with something else.\nThe time you were spending gaming replace it with study, cleaning the house, going for walks, finding nice bike rides, use the uni gym, tend to the garden, read a book, visit somewhere (library, museum, art gallery, exhibition, shops etc), go to a cafe with a book and sit there and read for a few hours with a hot chocolate/coffee and a cake, learn to enjoy your own company outside of gaming! \nThere\u2019s a book called Rebel Badge Club that is like an adult version of scouts badges, you can earn badges for different things by completing clauses.. I have been slowly working through it and is given me a great focus and pushed me out of my comfort zone to try new things! Find something like this, even if it\u2019s just a list of places you can visit in a day trip and slowly tick them off one by one, a list of skills you want you learn and start learning one of them (a language, instrument, crochet/knitting, painting, photography, cooking etc). Just put the gaming down and fill that time. If you find that you\u2019re struggling then read into late diagnosed ADHD and see if maybe it fits you, a lot of undiagnosed adults tend to be the ones with no motivation, addiction (gaming, shopping, exercise obsession, alcohol, drugs etc), and stuck in a cycle they can\u2019t escape. Either way, you need support gaming.. even if that means getting the console out of the house for six months", "Eccentric college professor is definitely a whole vibe.", "Yoooo no joke same on the ripped gym guy partner. Never once made me feel bad about how i look , even through some highly questionable style choices. \n\nApparently his biggest physical criteria is dumptruck lol", "TBF OPs brother is not the ruler of the Seven Kingdoms.
