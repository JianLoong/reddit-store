But my telling you that relationships are not impossible for people with our severity level is not some hideous insult or dismissing anything about your experience.  \n\nYou think something is impossible. I am proof it is not. And I'm not some special exception. I'm just another autistic person with different experiences.\n\nI didn't say you should want a relationship. I didn't even say you could definitely have one. Just that it's not impossible. Autistics, including level 2 autistics like myself, can and do date and it's not helping any of us to insist that it's impossible or to be offended by someone saying it IS possible.\n\nI'm honestly sorry that you were upset by what I said, as I did my level best to make it very clear I wasnt telling you what you should or should not want, only to disabuse you of the notion that so much is DEFINITELY IMPOSSIBLE. But ultimately, all I did was share my experience, which is no less valid than yours. I am not less autistic than you simply because I have found someone to be with. And there are only two of us here in this conversation, so you're just as likely to be the unique exception as I am.\n\nAnd statistics are not useful for individuals, anyway. They're to show trends.

But I will point out that in the video description it says that that kid saw massive improvements after they figured out that it was being caused by low blood sugar and addressed it. It was also nine years ago. I\u2019d be curious how he\u2019s doing now.\n\nLook, I\u2019m not saying these things WILL happen for you. No one can ever really predict that. But I just think foreclosing yourself to the possibilities isn\u2019t helpful. You also can\u2019t know that things will NEVER turn around for you. Particularly if you make some honest efforts to improve your lot. \n\nI know multiple people on the spectrum (not just myself) that have friends (I should know, I\u2019m friends with some of them) and have been fortunate enough to find partners, often multiple past partners as well. It\u2019s harder, for sure. But statistics aren\u2019t everything. Those are traditionally skewed very heavily based on who is actually diagnosed and in some kind of active treatment or care. I assume you and I are both diagnosed, but my point is that people actively in care homes (which you say you aren\u2019t) are over represented in these polls. \n\nA quick purview of your profile suggests that you\u2019re still seeking advice about this, so I think you haven\u2019t fully given up yet. I hope you don\u2019t let your sadness completely overtake you. It almost did that to me a bunch of times.

I suppose I can see how my original comment wasn't needed and was 'defensive' which is where pixiee is taking issue. Me going 'both sides' probably wasn't particularly helpful and came off as trying to defend Bill in the story which wasn't my intent.\n\nYet they're being far more defensive about the subject than I was, I don't see the need for it when everyone seems to agree anyway that this isn't a gendered issue. So why the need to silence and put down?", "Preach!", "5% seems a bit high", "Constantly silencing men because you don't want to hear that women pull this shit too is not a good look.

This is especially true when the behaviour is legit abusive, but also just for minor level, everyday assholery. If the stories aren't shared, then people go 'well I'VE never heard of women acting that way so obviously they don't.' \n\nAnd that is, deep down, why so many so-called feminists (anyone who doesn't get that patriarchy is not something men do to women, but something societal that hurts us ALL is not any kind of feminist in my book) are so vitriolic every time any man dares to share an experience like yours (or worse). They want you to shut up so they can keep pretending only men do this shit. It's utterly anti-feminist and actually really fucking dehumanising to women to pretend we aren't fully capable of shit behaviour. \n\nSo, since I am a female-bodied person (so they can't just dismiss me for having the wrong genitals to speak), I try to call it out wherever I see it."]}
