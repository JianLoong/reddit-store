We live in a more rural area, so there aren't that many single women around his age to begin with.  The ones who are available, well Bill didn't think they were good enough.\n\nHe asked me to edit his Hinge profile so he can attract a mate.  I looked it over and... damn.  His profile has paragraphs of what he's looking for in a woman: skinny, cute, under 30, average to high income, and lives locally.  She must be into anime and gaming.  The only pictures he's got are grainy selfies or pictures with one or both parents.  Mostly our mom.\n\nBill lives with our parents and has been working as a door greeter at Walmart since he was 18.   \n\nI told Bill that he doesn't need to overhaul his page, he needs to overhaul his life.  No woman meeting his wants would want to date an obese thirty-year-old living off of his parents and working a job Walmart normally gives to old people to stay busy.  \n\nBill freaked out on me and told our mom.  She's upset because I tried to tear him down when he needed my help.  She wants me to apologize, but what's there to apologize?  I just told Bill what was wrong and that he should consider changing his life if he really wants what he wants.

He seems to be asking for a lot with not very much to give in return!\n\nPersonally I would probably have chosen not to respond /hello rather than to say all of that, even though it's true.\n\nCan't judge you the AH though, he asked for your help and you gave him the truth.", "NTA - you gave him the help he asked for.   He didn't get the help the way he wanted it, but you gave him true advice.  The way his profile reads he is looking for a sugar mama to take care of him!!!", "NTA. The fact that he ran straight to mommy and that mommy now wants op to apologize is exactly how and why Bill is in this position. He needs therapy and a life coach, but my guess is he can\u2019t be bothered. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA. What on earth were you supposed to do? Your mother has a very positive view of him so she'd be the best person to help him with his profile.", "NTA Though it seems like he won't learn on his own anytime soon it's not everyone else's fault he's not finding someone. It's the fact he's not putting effort into improving himself.  \nBecause as it is, it sounds like his standards are too high.   \nIt's like he's trying to look for caviar, on a imitation crab budget. \n\nOr walking into every store and complaining they all smell funny without realizing he stepped in something.  \n\n\nHe needs more hobbies, and he needs to learn a good work ethic is attractive.", "NTA, he\u2019s deluded and it needed saying. Just reading this his attitude towards women made my skin crawl. His list is not ok coming from anyone.", "NTA.... technically. Ouch that's harsh but at the same time, if he wants a gf he's going to have to be realistic.\n\n\"I AM A MEDIOCRE MAN AND THESE ARE ALL MY DEMANDS!!\"", "NTA.\n\nHis virginity must have grown back by now surely?", "NTA\n\n\nI have a friend who is in a similar boat only he wants a woman who will move to a rural \u201cvillage\u201d because he grew up there. I told him we\u2019re not in our 20s and most women have themselves established. He also is pretty acne filled at over 30.", "NTA. I can\u2019t believe he complained to mommy. He has a lot of growing up to do.", "Some people are tone deaf but with who they are. I think he is and needs a hearing aid.", "NTA, you're right in what you said honestly, especially because of his \"requirements\" being... well, not great. Reminds me of certain kind of people...\n\nBut yea, it was harsh, but the truth.", "BRO NEEDED A REALITY CHECK.\n\nNTA, maybe you were too harsh in your tone.. there's always a softer way to express your opinions n, especially when it's hard for someone to accept it.", "Nta. Sounds like someone needed to pop his bubble, Hopefully He'll wake up one day. I wouldn't apologize to him, I'd honestly double down on it.

It was tough love.  If he wants to find someone he needs to get his life in order.  You weren't making fun of him, you were being honest.\n\nI'm not sure if I'm only noticing it now, but there seems to be an abnormal number of adults from 20 well into their 30's that act like, and are still treated like teenagers.", "how dare you insult mothers golden egg? /s\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "NTA.

Yes, you were harsh, but he asked you to edit his profile. I'm getting vibes of incel (or does he think he's really going to get a woman to support him?) and his unrealistic requirements aren't doing him any favors. Has he ever left home, or does he have a plan from getting out from under the parents' roof? I wouldn't apologize for what you said, but I also would never agree to help again.", "ESH\n\nYou're right that he needs a major reality check. His profile sounds like instant \"hell no\" territory. But there was no need to basically tear him to the bone, call him a loser and fat-shame him all at once just because he has unrealistic dating expectations. Trust me - Tinder will destroy his confidence fast enough without you stepping in.", "ESH: him because of, well, everything... You, is a soft YTA because he probably needs someone to be an AH to him to snap him out of his delusions. Nothing wrong with working at Wal Mart. It's honest work, but if he's been there 12 years as the greeter, that's horrifically sad.", "NTA\n\nBut, rather than giving him useless critique why don't you do something positive and take him to the gym with you?", "YTA - sounds like you punched down a lot there.", "ESH, you were a bit harsh but he asked for advise. And maybe it's good to be bluntly honest...? (NTA if you already tried before and tried talking to him and he keeps on complaining etc)", "YTA. You can tell him the truth with the intention of helping change and find a better life. It sounds that you delivered the feedback in a way that was harsh and hurtful. It will probably do nothing to help him change and only get down on himself and even possibly make things worse. It\u2019s not the message it\u2019s the method.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's a trainwreck.      \n\n\nYou could have approached it a bit more ..productively though?      Out of curiosity, does he have any mental health concerns or intellectual disabilities?

Sometimes the best thing for a person is that they hear the truth. Your brother is one whisker away from being an incel, and if he does hope to have any success with women it sounds like he definitely needs to overhaul his life.

So why should he expect his partner to have all of that.", "NTA, specially since he then involved mon on this. \n\nHowever, it may not be what you asked for, but if you really want to help him there are other ways to convey the message that are more gentle and maybe would impact him better. I think  it might be worth \"apologizing\" for the crudeness and see if he can hear you better if you come with a softer tone.

Being obese and working at Walmart and living with mommy at the age of 30 while demanding a partner be young, skinny and lots of money is just\u2026.. repulsive.", "He scores points for not listing someone 18-21.", "He's being honest in his request for a sugar mama (but obviously needs to  change the age requirements) who will support him.
