Cut her off, take the baby and get out of there because she\u2019s not only going to keep abusing you but now she has a whole other being to abuse as well.", "Don\u2019t be low contact with her be NO CONTACT with her. \n\nI wish I could say tell your oldest she left herself and blah blah but it\u2019s not really right to lie to your child, and tho it\u2019d make it easier now, it will her hurt in the future. \n\nSo instead just cut contact with your mum and tell your daughter that your mum did some awful things. I\u2019m all for sheltering children but if you shelter them from from the horrible things horrible people did that you cut off they\u2019re gonna blame you. \nBe up front about why you cut her off or at least say she hurt a lot of people and would continue. \n\nJust please please pleeeaaase cut her off. It\u2019ll break your daughters heart but it will only break both your hearts in the future when your daughter not only is someday treated the same way by your mother but also when she has no relationship with you. \n\nSo please cut her off, only surround yourself with people who respect YOU AND YOUR CHILDREN. Good people who don\u2019t manipulate and who aren\u2019t a bad influence. \n\nMaybe even find a partner if you don\u2019t have one (a good one), or even contact the dad/s (if they\u2019re good people) so they can hang with their kids more, and maybe even have more adult caretakers/figures in their lives. \n\nBasically just cut contact with their grandmother, she\u2019s gonna ruin so many peoples lives if you don\u2019t.", "Those men were insufferable creeps, society really needs to understand just because someone pregnant doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re okay with being touched, same as if they weren\u2019t.", "This has made my day! Your friend is a legend for sure!", "Wow, I think you need to sit your mother down and have a serious conversation with her. \n\nTell her you love her but (only if she wasn\u2019t a bad parent) she\u2019s already done her job raising you (thank her maybe or something if she did a good job, or something idk but eases tension) and now it\u2019s time for you to do yours. \n\nAnd ask her to understand, and that you want her to be around (if you do) and that you\u2019d love for her to help and be around her grandkid. But some things that she do cross the line and some things just aren\u2019t her decision to make. And that while maybe a grandmother gets to tell the kid off for not going to be on time or breaking something while she\u2019s at her house, the main rule maker and caretaker will always be the parents. \n\nWhile grandparents get a say they do not get a say over the parents. And while she\u2019s your mother who you love, you are no longer a child and your mother doesn\u2019t hold any power over your decisions, but you love each other and she needs to respect you as an adult. \n\nIf she wants to help again you\u2019d be more than grateful and love her for it. But there\u2019s a difference between helping and controlling. \n\nNot to mention talk to her about the fact while she might trust someone and be comfortable with them, doesn\u2019t mean you are. And that not everyone is how they seem."]}
