Nobody would rub a non pregnant womans belly so why does it make it okay to touch a pregnant woman? \ud83e\udd14", "Love that! haha", ">One lady told me not to walk my dogs because the leashes would tangle my umbilical cord???\n\nThat lady is walking her dogs the wrong way.", "LOL! Maybe stare at them and tell them you're not pregnant!  I bet they back off then!", "Oh her chewing me out happened after the meal was over, I kind of just ignored her (it was over text messaging) because I can\u2019t really stand up to her due to childhood trauma", "Was my step dads birthday, felt forced to go honestly. I\u2019ve gone VERY low contact. Went low contact after I tried to talk to her about my mental state and saying I needed a break from my kids for a few hours. She made it about her and made me feel like a shit person for needing to be away from the kids for a while. Completely dismissed my feelings and I was really hurt after the things she said, so I more or less just quit talking to her there and then. I\u2019ve seen her once in the last 4 weeks which is unusual", "I had that too when I was pregnant with my first. People would come up to me while I was at work and just touch me. I\u2019m pregnant not public property! It was usually men as well\ud83e\udd2e", "I\u2019m not sure I see a distinction between \u201cmake up an excuse\u201d and lying.\n\n\u201cThank you, no\u201d is an appropriate, complete, and polite answer. It\u2019s not on OP to provide any further explanation because a stranger is pushy, or because MIL wants to rack up some social status points with her intrusive friends.\n\nNot sure why you\u2019re so keen to put the onus on OP, instead of those who were aggressively rude.", "Its a really old religious/cultural belief in a couple different groups that the act of a pregnant woman having cords tangled in her presence will cause karma or something to tangle the umbilical cord.", "Time to put mama on a time out! You did nothing wrong!", "Keep it up!  And do Not feel guilty. You are doing this for your kids, spare them from being pawns in her nasty game.", "No one ever told me no that\u2019s why I had no idea that could be a possibility \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f now that I know I won\u2019t be asking every time I see a baby", "Isn\u2019t it strange? It\u2019s like everyone wants you to have a baby, talks about how wonderful and rewarding it is\u2026then when you commit to it, they start telling you all the horror stories. It\u2019s almost like a bunch of people got duped into having kids, and now they want to do the same to other people to share in the misery? Not saying having children is misery, I\u2019m just not quite sure how else to describe this strange phenomenon.", "Not a mom, so not sure, but isn't 4 months old kinda young for strangers or even distant relatives to hold?", "[removed]", "It's okay ! I get that they are very cute, we just often, as late teens/adults tend to forget to have empathy for babies too, because they can't speak, move by themselves ect, which can make us feel like they're not like us. ( we often do the same w animal, because they also do not have the same way to express themselves and communicate ).^^", "Geez, I go the other way haha I love babies but they tend to not love me (pretty sure it's my glasses) so I'm happy to hold them while you pee/eat/adult task but always say PLEASE don't go far!! I wanna help my mum friends but I don't find joy in terrorising a screaming potato!!", "I've come to the conclusion that these people never wanted to have kids and hated being parents. Why else would they seemingly only remember the negatives and only want to tell you about anything awful they went through?", "I think so.", "Chastise your mom. She should be protecting her grandchild, not pimp out the baby! How does she know he meant no harm? Is she trying to get your baby hurt?\n\nSeriously, this would be a hill for me to die on. I'd go full mama bear on grandma and read her the riot act. Tell her she could get your kid traumatised, hurt or kidnapped, so she needs to get her thinking pants on.\n\nAlso, bombard her with articles about how babies get illnesses from getting held and how they can die. Grandma needs a strong wakeup call."]}
