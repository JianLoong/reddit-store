Since our father was always working, I took care of Jaime whenever I wasn't studying for months, and my aunt helped out when I wasn't available. \n\nWhen Jaime was nine months old, our father brought his new girlfriend (now stepmother) to live with us just four months after our mother's death. I didn't get along with her because I suspected that she and our father had been having an affair while our mother was still alive. However, she became Jaime's primary caregiver and raised him like her own son. \n\nAfter a troubled first year we managed to keep our balance by ignoring each otherwe, we only fight when she wanted to legally adopt Jaime (She tried like 5 times), which my maternal grandparents and myself objected to. In the end, my father agreed to wait until Jaime was old enough to decide for himself.  \n\nI went to college in the same city as my maternal grandparents when I was 17, but I visited my brother every weekend that I could. Now, I live in the same city as my grandparents with my boyfriend, and we often play online games with Jaime. \n\nUnfortunately, our father passed away from a sudden illness caused by an unknown heart disease three weeks ago. When I spoke to my stepmother about bringing Jaime to live with me, she didn't react well and said she wouldn't let me take her son. However, I am now Jaime's legal guardian since our father has passed away, and I believe it's in his best interest to live with me in a bigger city with more opportunities and more contact with my maternal grandparents. \n\nMy stepmother has threatened to go to court to adopt my brother, but I plan to look for a lawyer as soon as possible. She also suggested that we let Jaime choose who he wants to live with, but I don't think it's fair to leave such a difficult decision up to a young child. \n\nMy paternal family and stepmother's family are calling me a monster and saying that I want to take a child away from his mother. They also say that I won't know how to discipline him. However, I love Jaime just as much as my stepmother does, and I believe it's in his best interest to live with me. My maternal family and fianc\u00e9 support me, but I'm wondering if AITA?\n\nEDIT: The cities are 3 hours away, I proposed to take him home every other weekend and she can visit him whenever she wants. \n\nEDIT 2:From previous experiences where she tried to stop my brother from spending time with my maternal grandparents I know she would do the same to me.", "created_utc": 1682832793, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133gt0e/aita_for_wanting_custody_of_my_brother_after_my/", "score": 412, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The first paragraph says he was 5 months old when your mother passed, and then the second says he was 9 years old. How long has he been living with your stepmother, and how old is he now?", "I think even the courts will look for what's best for the child. What does he actually want?", "How old is your brother and what does he want?\n\nHow much money did your dad leave for your brother's care, and is it enough for you to care for him?", "Info: what is actually best for little bro? Does he have problems with step mom? Does he have friends there / enjoy his school? Why would he be better with you?\n\nSounds like (if we are doing what is best for him) rather than taking him away from the person who has raised him most of his life, you could go there for more support. \n\nSeems a bit more like you are doing it because he is rightful property instead of what is really the best thing for him? You can be there for him anyway without uprooting him", "Per your comments, she has been his stepmother since he was 9 months old (or at least in his life since then. For HIM, she is the ONLY Mother he knows. He just lost his Dad too, and now you want to take him from the ONLY mother he has ever known. You haven't lived at home for years. How can you think the best thing for him is to uproot EVERYTHING he knows after losing his Dad. Blood doesn't always make family.\n\nI imagine your Dad had a will. Has this been read yet? What makes you believe you are his legal guardian?\n\nAlso YTA. He would lose everything he knows.", "YTA. From your own words, stepmother has acted in a parental role for Jaime since he was 5 months old. She may not have adopted him legally, but he is his adopted mom regardless. From what you've written, I think you may be letting your hurt over your losing your mom and your anger at the possible affair your dad dad with stepmom overshadow what's best for your brother. Of course your mom can't be erased, but stepmom has been acting as his stepmother for his whole life basically. And now you want to force him to be uprooted after he just lost his dad, and come live with you without even asking Jaime what he wants? That's just cruel. You need to put what's best for your brother ahead of your own emotions regarding your stepmother.", "As far as he is concerned, that is his mother. He was a baby when she came into his life and that is the only mother he has ever known, correct? So his dad died and now you want to take his mother away? If she truly loves him like her own son, I think that would be a heartless thing to do to both of them. Is she not a good mother to him? Or do you just feel you can do better? I am afraid it may do more damage than good to rip him away from the only mother, he's ever known. I understand you were upset that she has tried to erase your mother from his and your lives, but he has no memories of your mother. Only of her. I think it would be emotionally traumatizing for him.", "I\u2019m so sorry for all your losses, OP. This can\u2019t have been an easy path to walk. \n\nNTA. \n\nThe problem is that you haven\u2019t really shown where your step-mom is a bad parent. She\u2019s been parenting Jaime since he was an infant. She\u2019s the only mother he\u2019s ever known. She\u2019s super attached to him and I would hope so! \n\nI get that she\u2019s not your mom and you feel like she was waiting in the wings to swoop in. But idk if that\u2019s a good enough reason to take Jaime away from his mom. \n\nI agree with you that asking Jaime what he wants to do seems a bit much for a 9 year old boy to navigate. If he was 12-13 I\u2019d say to ask his opinion. He is being pulled in two directions and probably doesn\u2019t want anyone to be mad at him or to give the wrong answer. He\u2019s had enough loss. \n\nSo, there can never seem to be a wrong answer if you decide to go the route of asking him. \n\nBoth you and step mom have to get together and agree that no matter what his opinion is you won\u2019t punish him emotionally or hold his opinion against him. And he has to know that. \n\nYou\u2019re both trying to do right by him. This is a hard situation, OP. No one is an asshole here. But please if you do decide to go for custody, bend over backwards to make sure he can see his mom very regularly and that she is a part of his life", "YTA for not talking to your brother about whether or not he wants to upend his life and move somewhere else.  \nYour brother has been at least partly raised by someone he considers his mom. He has a house, a room, and a life. He presumably has friends. He deserves some consideration.  \nIt sounds like you've been at odds with your stepmom from the very beginning, but it doesn't sound like she's really done anything but marry your widowed father and help raise his motherless child. Even if you don't have any feeling for a woman who just lost her husband and now may lose her son, certainly you could have some feeling for your brother about taking him away from his mom.", "YTA for wanting to drag a young child away from his friends, his home, and the only mother he's ever known. \n\nYOUR bad relationship with your stepmom is coloring your view here, and you're projecting that, and trying to put him in the middle of a legal fight while he's grieving, instead of considering his ACTUAL best interests. \n\nPlease stop. I feel for you, but please stop.", "NAH but you should consider that your stepmother is the only mother your brother has ever known. He should definitely have a say in whether he loses the person who has mothered him for 9 years. Just because you don\u2019t have a good relationship with her doesn\u2019t mean he feels that way. Tread carefully. You could be doing a tremendously cruel thing to your brother.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your losses. Your mom's family deserves to see your little brother, and I would totally worry that the stepmother would keep him away from them.", "Your timeline doesn't add up. What's the child want, you didn't mention anything other than yours...?", "YTA. I don\u2019t like what your stepmother said to him, but regardless she\u2019s the only mother he\u2019s ever known. He just lost his father and now you want to take him away from his mother??? I doubt any child would choose that even if she hadn\u2019t said that to him. \n\nSo long as you aren\u2019t leaving out any details such as her being abusive, you would be the asshole, and risk making your brother hate you. \n\nYou can be part of his life and visit, and you should, but taking him away from his mother should be a decision he makes when he\u2019s old enough.", "This woman has raised your brother like her own since he was a few months old. Your dad was hardly wealthy, so it's not like she's using your brother for some big financial gain.\n\nSo, if your mother passed away when Jamie was 5 months old and your dad moved his girlfriend in 4 months later, that means she's been raising Jaimie for over 8 years. \n\nSince then, you've seen Jamie on weekends, you've played online games...but you've never raised a child, full time - that's breakfast, lunch and dinner, that's laundry and cleaning and doctors appointments and taking him to school and back, doing homework, doing play dates and not being able to go out and have fun anywhere near as often as you're doing now. It involves money and sacrifice and energy. Do you work? Does your boyfriend work? What happens if you break up?\n\nAnd yes, I think you *can* and *should* ask your brother and have that discussion; he's young but he can tell you what he wants.\n\nAs for opinions flying left right and centre - of course your maternal grandparents will be against the woman who your dad possibly cheated on their daughter with...but again, this isn't about you or them. It's about a 9 year old boy who has grown up with *this* mother, even if she's not blood related, the feeling for him is the same since he wouldn't have any memory of your bio mother. So he lost his dad and now stands to lose his mom...I can imagine that will mess his up big time. \n\nDon't let your dislike for this woman or whatever assumptions you've made along the way cloud your judgement.", "YTA - you don\u2019t live with Jaime, he just lost his father, how is uprooting him from his home and moving him to a place he doesn\u2019t know going to be beneficial to him?\n\nYou playing games with him, online, and visiting every now and then is not equivalent to a parent who is there every day.", "I\u2019m confused you said you lost your mom when your brother was 5 months old then when your brother is 9 yrs old the girlfriend comes into the picture 4 months after your mothers death ?? That doesn\u2019t make sense", "So sorry you lost your father - what a sad situation. \n\nI think you need to put yourself in your brother\u2019s shoes. It doesn\u2019t sound like your stepmother is so awful it warrants removing your brother from the only home & mother he\u2019s ever known at this point. Taking him away at this point sounds like it would compound the trauma of losing his father. \n\nCan you take a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach. Make sure stepmom is looking out for him. Increase visits in person to keep an eye on things and IF there is evidence (other than not liking this woman) she\u2019s not treating him properly or she tries to prevent you from seeing him - then take a more forceful approach. \n\nAlso - you need to dial in a little more compassion for stepmom. The fact she would be devastated if your brother moves away is a good thing. It means she loves him truly. Try to imagine losing your husband suddenly and then have the possibility of losing a child you raised. That is terrifying and totally devastating. \n\nBe careful about putting brother in the middle. This can be an impossible situation to be in and cause him even more emotional distress. It\u2019s very common for children of divorce to experience trauma from this. \n\nYou need to really think about what\u2019s absolutely best for your brother and put that ahead of your experience and emotions. He\u2019s had a different journey than you and you need to understand where he\u2019s at.", "So your mom died when jamie was 5 months and four months later when jamie was 9 your step mom moved in op can you explain\nEdit: acording to your comments after a year college and an unspecified amount of time he is still nine", "NTA.

If you're able to provide and care for him, and if that's what he wants at this stage in his life, then you can't be an asshole. You're going to be providing what a kid wants and needs.\n\nThat said, you should proceed calmly and without rushing into things. It's going to be a hard time for him already. Change only makes things harder. Make sure he's handling the grieving process and ready to even talk about moving. When he's ready to talk about it, find out what he wants. There are some logistics you'll have to factor in: moving means leaving his friends and starting somewhere new. It may be best to let him finish out his current school year where he is and then get him moved in with you. Losing his friend group like that can make the trauma worse, it can be isolating. Unless he's unhappy with his stepmom, if he's not doing well in that house, then you may have to screw the complications and just move him.", "NTA - If you're the legal guardian, there really isn't any discussion.

As a family lawyer myself i don't know of many judges who would remove a child from the care of a stable adult who has been acting as their parent the majority of their life. Most places have a 'best interest' test for determining these situations. Even though you are your brother's closest living relative you have an uphill climb to prove it is in his best interest to move in with you, in a new city, new school, completely unfamiliar environment.

The most important thing is that what happens next is what is best for him. If he views her as his mum - regardless of how much that may irk/hurt/frustrate/offend/annoy you and your maternal family - then taking him to a completely new environment away from his remaining parent is cruel.\n\nAlso your reason for wanting custody seems to be that you are scared that you, your maternal family and your mother's memory will be pushed out of his life if you don't get custody. I'm going to be blunt, that is a very selfish reason to up root a child who just lost their parent.

That is MORE than old enough to have a say in who he wants to live with.", "You're completely assuming that's opposite of what op is saying with no information to back it up.", "I don't think she's emotionally manipulating him, but if that's that your metric for getting cps involved read op's comments. While they're understandably hurting (just like the stepmother), many of their comments are just as damaging if not more so in terms of court and cps getting involved.", "What this woman said to a 9 year old child is abusive. If she said it to an adult it would be abusive. 'Poor woman...' my God.", "You know damn well that's an abusive thing for the stepmother to have said to a 9 year old child. It is NOT just 'talking' to him.", "Ditto! That is such a weird statement and OP has written it a couple of times. Like, is she saying they wanted to take the baby themselves? He had a father.", "The chances are pretty high that even if he didn't leave a will, there's evidence and records of the adoption attempts which the father was fully supportive of. The only reason they were put off was OP and his late wife's family's objections. That in conjunction with the fact that the stepmother has been the boy's primary caregiver for almost his entire life and that he has a stable rooted life with her in their hometown makes it more likely that a judge or family advocate will side with the stepmother. Ripping the brother from his only remaining parent would cause undue trauma on top of death of his father, and uprooting him from his life (like school and friends) would most likely not be in his best interest. The courts and authorities side with what's best for the child, and while I'm sure op is a great sister, her having custody and taking him away from the only life he's ever known when there's a loving, stable, and familiar environment is objectively not in his best interest.", "He's her step son, not her son.", "No, because she told him that she can't live without him. You don't say that to children.", "Yeah\u2026.I reread it, and reading some of the comments.  This is really an advertisement for why  some stepparents are insistent on adoption.  This should have come up as part of the discussion - what would Dad want to happen in this scenario?  Seems like the kid would be better off with stability at this point.  She\u2019s the only mom he\u2019s ever known.", "Wanting to uproot his life JUST IN CASE you and your grandparents don\u2019t get to see him as much as you\u2019d like is cruel, selfish and entitled. Sorry for your loss but YTA.", "I think you need to have a think about the meaning of the phrase \u201cthe best interests of the child\u201d. Because you are looking at this from the best interests of YOU, of your opinion, of your beliefs. \n\nSaying that a move to a city will give a 9 year old more \u2018opportunities\u2019 is just bizarre. 9 year olds need stability and love. \n\nIt sounds like your step mother isn\u2019t perfect, but I also think you have pretty much no chance of getting custody - so you need to work out a way to work with the step-mother.", "She could make the same argument about you\u2026", "Why will he be better with you than with his mother (the only one he\u2019s ever had)? Remember, him living with you will also take him away from the place he\u2019s known his whole life, all his friends, his school, activities etc. How is taking all that from him honestly better? And now, when he\u2019s just lost his father.                         \nPlease don\u2019t do this. He will be traumatised. Him enjoying visiting you is not the same as him wanting to live with you and leave his whole life behind. You\u2019re being incredibly selfish and cruel.\n\n\nYTA.", "Thank you! Yeah OP YTA. Stepmom is the only mom your brother has known. If he wants to stay with her, you should respect that choice.", "What papers? Your mother's name would still be on his birth certificate. I think your maternal grandparents might have lied to you about what was going to happen if your stepmom adopted your brother.", "> I couldn't be expected to react well to that at 16 years old\n\nwhat do you mean you \"couldn't\"? 16 is old enough to understand how adoption and step-parenting works.", "OP is clearly an unreliable narrator so I\u2019m pretty certain this conversation didn\u2019t go down the way she\u2019s trying to claim it is.", "She literally raised him from baby. The only reason she is not adoptive parent is that OP with grandparents prevented it 5 times.\n\nThe emotional bond is parental one.", "Sorry, but his mother is still a part of him and he deserves to know about her. You keep saying this like she chose to disappear on him. To pretend that there is no bond because she isn't alive anymore is odd, that's literally half of who he is.", "\u201cThe only mom he\u2019s ever known shouldn\u2019t try to influence him *but* you should!\u201d", "I don't know about where you live but in Australia the kid gets a new birth certificate with the adopted parents and their original information is restricted. Unless you know what to look for you wouldn't know they were adopted.", "I like that op is quite immature and seeming detached from reality. YTA\n\nBut maybe I am just high", "Not saying he doesn\u2019t, and he doesn\u2019t need to be ripped from his home for that to happen.", "Their father was responsible for keeping her memory alive,  not the stepmother.", "Do not do this because it is WRONG to do to a nine year old.", "So just to clarify if you're grandparents went broke and you couldn't rely on them, and had to find another place to live, and be the primary provider and caregiver for your 9 year old brother, you'd have the means to do so?", "In the US birth certificates don't change. Weird that they would change that.", "My god. Each comment you write is proof that you are in no capable of taking care of a child. \n\nYou\u2019re petty and immature. You were FOURTEEN years old. You, in no way, should be taking care of an infant long term. Your Dad wouldn\u2019t wanted you to be parentified and she was a blessing to come in and love on that baby as her own. \n\nThink about it - you seriously don\u2019t want your brother to have a loving mother figure because you\u2019re pissed about something that happened when you were fourteen? \n\nMy god, let it go. Grow up. Fix yourself.", "Then let your brother stay where he is", "OP is very immature and just wants to \"win\". She does not have her brother's best interest in mind. \n\nI really hope they live someplace where the courts are good and will make the right decision for the brother.", "WHOA. You\u2019re a huge AH and this comment confirms it. \n\n\u201cMy grandparents had no reason to make her feel welcome\u201d is just a petty, toxic and immature statement. If your grandparents truly wanted to be involved with your brother, they would treat everyone like family. They clearly were petty and classless in this. \n\nYou\u2019re brainwashed and absolutely delusional if you think taking him away from the only parent he has left is a good idea. \n\nYou\u2019re young and have a MAJOR amount of growing up to do. You lack emotional intelligence and maturity. \n\nDon\u2019t punish and ruin your brother because you\u2019re petty and toxic. Go fix yourself and live out your 20s.", "This is a gorgeous and well written comment. Thank you for taking the time to share some free educational labor to OP. \n\nOP, read this over and over. You\u2019re being toxic and cruel and holding onto old grudges.", "I hope you don't meant it's wrong to get therapy for a grieving 9 year old?", "Birth certificates change all the time here. If you change your name or sex it all changes the birth certificate with just a little note on the back saying something changed.", "No, I meant, do not take him aside and tell him his mother lied to him.\n\nEdited to add:\n\nI agree with therapy, etc., but the core reason not to do it (take him aside,  etc.) s because it could damage him, not because it could hurt her chances at custody.", "But not who gave birth to you.", "What do you do for surrogacy? Certificate doesn't say birth giver it says mother."]}
