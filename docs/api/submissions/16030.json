Since our father was always working, I took care of Jaime whenever I wasn't studying for months, and my aunt helped out when I wasn't available. \n\nWhen Jaime was nine months old, our father brought his new girlfriend (now stepmother) to live with us just four months after our mother's death. I didn't get along with her because I suspected that she and our father had been having an affair while our mother was still alive. However, she became Jaime's primary caregiver and raised him like her own son. \n\nAfter a troubled first year we managed to keep our balance by ignoring each otherwe, we only fight when she wanted to legally adopt Jaime (She tried like 5 times), which my maternal grandparents and myself objected to. In the end, my father agreed to wait until Jaime was old enough to decide for himself.  \n\nI went to college in the same city as my maternal grandparents when I was 17, but I visited my brother every weekend that I could. Now, I live in the same city as my grandparents with my boyfriend, and we often play online games with Jaime. \n\nUnfortunately, our father passed away from a sudden illness caused by an unknown heart disease three weeks ago. When I spoke to my stepmother about bringing Jaime to live with me, she didn't react well and said she wouldn't let me take her son. However, I am now Jaime's legal guardian since our father has passed away, and I believe it's in his best interest to live with me in a bigger city with more opportunities and more contact with my maternal grandparents. \n\nMy stepmother has threatened to go to court to adopt my brother, but I plan to look for a lawyer as soon as possible. She also suggested that we let Jaime choose who he wants to live with, but I don't think it's fair to leave such a difficult decision up to a young child. \n\nMy paternal family and stepmother's family are calling me a monster and saying that I want to take a child away from his mother. They also say that I won't know how to discipline him. However, I love Jaime just as much as my stepmother does, and I believe it's in his best interest to live with me. My maternal family and fianc\u00e9 support me, but I'm wondering if AITA?\n\nEDIT: The cities are 3 hours away, I proposed to take him home every other weekend and she can visit him whenever she wants. \n\nEDIT 2:From previous experiences where she tried to stop my brother from spending time with my maternal grandparents I know she would do the same to me.", "created_utc": 1682832793, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133gt0e/aita_for_wanting_custody_of_my_brother_after_my/", "score": 2610, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The first paragraph says he was 5 months old when your mother passed, and then the second says he was 9 years old. How long has he been living with your stepmother, and how old is he now?", "I think even the courts will look for what's best for the child. What does he actually want?", "How old is your brother and what does he want?\n\nHow much money did your dad leave for your brother's care, and is it enough for you to care for him?", "Info: what is actually best for little bro? Does he have problems with step mom? Does he have friends there / enjoy his school? Why would he be better with you?\n\nSounds like (if we are doing what is best for him) rather than taking him away from the person who has raised him most of his life, you could go there for more support. \n\nSeems a bit more like you are doing it because he is rightful property instead of what is really the best thing for him? You can be there for him anyway without uprooting him", "Per your comments, she has been his stepmother since he was 9 months old (or at least in his life since then. For HIM, she is the ONLY Mother he knows. He just lost his Dad too, and now you want to take him from the ONLY mother he has ever known. You haven't lived at home for years. How can you think the best thing for him is to uproot EVERYTHING he knows after losing his Dad. Blood doesn't always make family.\n\nI imagine your Dad had a will. Has this been read yet? What makes you believe you are his legal guardian?\n\nAlso YTA. He would lose everything he knows.", "YTA. From your own words, stepmother has acted in a parental role for Jaime since he was 5 months old. She may not have adopted him legally, but he is his adopted mom regardless. From what you've written, I think you may be letting your hurt over your losing your mom and your anger at the possible affair your dad dad with stepmom overshadow what's best for your brother. Of course your mom can't be erased, but stepmom has been acting as his stepmother for his whole life basically. And now you want to force him to be uprooted after he just lost his dad, and come live with you without even asking Jaime what he wants? That's just cruel. You need to put what's best for your brother ahead of your own emotions regarding your stepmother.", "As far as he is concerned, that is his mother. He was a baby when she came into his life and that is the only mother he has ever known, correct? So his dad died and now you want to take his mother away? If she truly loves him like her own son, I think that would be a heartless thing to do to both of them. Is she not a good mother to him? Or do you just feel you can do better? I am afraid it may do more damage than good to rip him away from the only mother, he's ever known. I understand you were upset that she has tried to erase your mother from his and your lives, but he has no memories of your mother. Only of her. I think it would be emotionally traumatizing for him.", "I\u2019m so sorry for all your losses, OP. This can\u2019t have been an easy path to walk. \n\nNTA. \n\nThe problem is that you haven\u2019t really shown where your step-mom is a bad parent. She\u2019s been parenting Jaime since he was an infant. She\u2019s the only mother he\u2019s ever known. She\u2019s super attached to him and I would hope so! \n\nI get that she\u2019s not your mom and you feel like she was waiting in the wings to swoop in. But idk if that\u2019s a good enough reason to take Jaime away from his mom. \n\nI agree with you that asking Jaime what he wants to do seems a bit much for a 9 year old boy to navigate. If he was 12-13 I\u2019d say to ask his opinion. He is being pulled in two directions and probably doesn\u2019t want anyone to be mad at him or to give the wrong answer. He\u2019s had enough loss. \n\nSo, there can never seem to be a wrong answer if you decide to go the route of asking him. \n\nBoth you and step mom have to get together and agree that no matter what his opinion is you won\u2019t punish him emotionally or hold his opinion against him. And he has to know that. \n\nYou\u2019re both trying to do right by him. This is a hard situation, OP. No one is an asshole here. But please if you do decide to go for custody, bend over backwards to make sure he can see his mom very regularly and that she is a part of his life", "YTA for not talking to your brother about whether or not he wants to upend his life and move somewhere else.  \nYour brother has been at least partly raised by someone he considers his mom. He has a house, a room, and a life. He presumably has friends. He deserves some consideration.  \nIt sounds like you've been at odds with your stepmom from the very beginning, but it doesn't sound like she's really done anything but marry your widowed father and help raise his motherless child. Even if you don't have any feeling for a woman who just lost her husband and now may lose her son, certainly you could have some feeling for your brother about taking him away from his mom.", "YTA for wanting to drag a young child away from his friends, his home, and the only mother he's ever known. \n\nYOUR bad relationship with your stepmom is coloring your view here, and you're projecting that, and trying to put him in the middle of a legal fight while he's grieving, instead of considering his ACTUAL best interests. \n\nPlease stop. I feel for you, but please stop.", "NAH but you should consider that your stepmother is the only mother your brother has ever known. He should definitely have a say in whether he loses the person who has mothered him for 9 years. Just because you don\u2019t have a good relationship with her doesn\u2019t mean he feels that way. Tread carefully. You could be doing a tremendously cruel thing to your brother.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your losses. Your mom's family deserves to see your little brother, and I would totally worry that the stepmother would keep him away from them.", "Your timeline doesn't add up. What's the child want, you didn't mention anything other than yours...?", "YTA. I don\u2019t like what your stepmother said to him, but regardless she\u2019s the only mother he\u2019s ever known. He just lost his father and now you want to take him away from his mother??? I doubt any child would choose that even if she hadn\u2019t said that to him. \n\nSo long as you aren\u2019t leaving out any details such as her being abusive, you would be the asshole, and risk making your brother hate you. \n\nYou can be part of his life and visit, and you should, but taking him away from his mother should be a decision he makes when he\u2019s old enough.", "This woman has raised your brother like her own since he was a few months old. Your dad was hardly wealthy, so it's not like she's using your brother for some big financial gain.\n\nSo, if your mother passed away when Jamie was 5 months old and your dad moved his girlfriend in 4 months later, that means she's been raising Jaimie for over 8 years. \n\nSince then, you've seen Jamie on weekends, you've played online games...but you've never raised a child, full time - that's breakfast, lunch and dinner, that's laundry and cleaning and doctors appointments and taking him to school and back, doing homework, doing play dates and not being able to go out and have fun anywhere near as often as you're doing now. It involves money and sacrifice and energy. Do you work? Does your boyfriend work? What happens if you break up?\n\nAnd yes, I think you *can* and *should* ask your brother and have that discussion; he's young but he can tell you what he wants.\n\nAs for opinions flying left right and centre - of course your maternal grandparents will be against the woman who your dad possibly cheated on their daughter with...but again, this isn't about you or them. It's about a 9 year old boy who has grown up with *this* mother, even if she's not blood related, the feeling for him is the same since he wouldn't have any memory of your bio mother. So he lost his dad and now stands to lose his mom...I can imagine that will mess his up big time. \n\nDon't let your dislike for this woman or whatever assumptions you've made along the way cloud your judgement.", "YTA - you don\u2019t live with Jaime, he just lost his father, how is uprooting him from his home and moving him to a place he doesn\u2019t know going to be beneficial to him?\n\nYou playing games with him, online, and visiting every now and then is not equivalent to a parent who is there every day.", "I\u2019m confused you said you lost your mom when your brother was 5 months old then when your brother is 9 yrs old the girlfriend comes into the picture 4 months after your mothers death ?? That doesn\u2019t make sense", "So sorry you lost your father - what a sad situation. \n\nI think you need to put yourself in your brother\u2019s shoes. It doesn\u2019t sound like your stepmother is so awful it warrants removing your brother from the only home & mother he\u2019s ever known at this point. Taking him away at this point sounds like it would compound the trauma of losing his father. \n\nCan you take a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach. Make sure stepmom is looking out for him. Increase visits in person to keep an eye on things and IF there is evidence (other than not liking this woman) she\u2019s not treating him properly or she tries to prevent you from seeing him - then take a more forceful approach. \n\nAlso - you need to dial in a little more compassion for stepmom. The fact she would be devastated if your brother moves away is a good thing. It means she loves him truly. Try to imagine losing your husband suddenly and then have the possibility of losing a child you raised. That is terrifying and totally devastating. \n\nBe careful about putting brother in the middle. This can be an impossible situation to be in and cause him even more emotional distress. It\u2019s very common for children of divorce to experience trauma from this. \n\nYou need to really think about what\u2019s absolutely best for your brother and put that ahead of your experience and emotions. He\u2019s had a different journey than you and you need to understand where he\u2019s at.", "So your mom died when jamie was 5 months and four months later when jamie was 9 your step mom moved in op can you explain\nEdit: acording to your comments after a year college and an unspecified amount of time he is still nine", "NTA.  Children should live with their guardian.  And if you're your brother's legal guardian,  then he should live with you. \n\nHowever, older children do have some legal rights.

If you're able to provide and care for him, and if that's what he wants at this stage in his life, then you can't be an asshole. You're going to be providing what a kid wants and needs.\n\nThat said, you should proceed calmly and without rushing into things. It's going to be a hard time for him already. Change only makes things harder. Make sure he's handling the grieving process and ready to even talk about moving. When he's ready to talk about it, find out what he wants. There are some logistics you'll have to factor in: moving means leaving his friends and starting somewhere new. It may be best to let him finish out his current school year where he is and then get him moved in with you. Losing his friend group like that can make the trauma worse, it can be isolating. Unless he's unhappy with his stepmom, if he's not doing well in that house, then you may have to screw the complications and just move him.", "NTA - If you're the legal guardian, there really isn't any discussion.

As a family lawyer myself i don't know of many judges who would remove a child from the care of a stable adult who has been acting as their parent the majority of their life.

Even though you are your brother's closest living relative you have an uphill climb to prove it is in his best interest to move in with you, in a new city, new school, completely unfamiliar environment.

I'm going to be blunt, that is a very selfish reason to up root a child who just lost their parent.

The stepmother and father are married and have been for several years, and the stepmother has been the primary caregiver for the child for 8.5 years since infancy. Op has stated there's been no abuse or mistreatment, outside of the one recent comment that may not be entirely accurate, and without evidence would be hearsay. The child also has a well established relationship and life with the stepmother, and has suffered trauma recently. The judge or authorities will look at evidence and outside testimony and place children in the best place for them, ideally where there will be the least negative consequences. While they don't make decisions solely based on the child's wishes, they will take them into account, and while 9 may be a little young, he is old enough to give his opinion and for it to have some merrit in terms of custody, in conjunction with other factors such as financial means, parenting ability, safety and comfort.", "you guys are being so ridiculous here man, i cannot believe there is this much widespread sympathy for a suspected homewrecker and her loser husband", "It's not a guarantee, but it's the most likely outcome, and I think op should prepare for that.

He will not understand why he's being taken away from his mother, why he has to leave his home, school, and friends. It will destroy him and his relationship with op and the maternal side of his family. Also while 9 may be considered by some to be a bit young, he's old enough to know what he wants, and if a judge or advocate asks... op has been skirting the questions about what the brother wants, and it's most likely because his answer is like the majority of children's answers when faced with a huge trauma like this.

On top of that you are weaponizing her own grief to strengthen your argument, her telling her son \"I don't know what I'd do without you\" can absolutely be as simple as telling someone you love them and will always be there for them during a time of loss, and you're calling it emotional blackmail.\n\nYTA and You really need to talk to a professional, I worry about you and your brother if these issues are your only focus when both you and him just lost your dad.", "YTA.

Sadly, it\u2019s possible for parents to be good parents to one kid and bad parents to another. The question you need to ask yourself is, will she be a good parent to him?\n\nFor better or for worse, she is his mother in every way that matters. He just lost his father, taking him away from his mother, home, and friends would be an additional huge trauma. And while I get you\u2019re concerned that the stepmother will interfere in your relationship, has she ever really gone the extra mile like lying to him about you, lying about his/your availability, actively interfering while you\u2019re spending time together?

It sounds like your step mother set things right in that instance. Maybe she didn\u2019t discuss it with you correctly, but that wasn\u2019t her job as a new partner. It was your fathers job to explain to you that you\u2019re not a \u201cdecoration\u201d but a child. A child generally doesn\u2019t make household decisions or take on the caregiver role for other children. Maybe she didn\u2019t come into your life the right way, and it certainly seems like neither of you did much to mend that which is okay. This is common with children who were parentified though, to feel like they are responsible for- or even would be the best choice for- raising the younger sibling. They often butt heads with the parenting style of the new partner because they feel like they have an inherent right to have a voice in the matter. You didn\u2019t though. You were a child. No one blames you for being angry with the step parent, but some of the responsibility of this situation lands on your dad too.\n\nTo be Frank here, you\u2019re trying to uproot a 9 year old from everything they\u2019ve ever known solely over that grudge. You keep using her saying she can\u2019t live without him as the reason, and I\u2019m telling you, if your only reason is a grief stricken parent using a poor choice of words to express her care over a child she raised you\u2019re gonna lose in court. You seem to think you\u2019re the better environment because you and your grandparents feel alienated without caring about what\u2019s actually best or what actions you took that led to you not being able to have a full relationship with that child. Not one thing you\u2019ve stated here has led me to believe that the step parent isn\u2019t a good environment for that child. In fact, as a parent myself, if someone was trying to overstep and threatening to take away a child I raised while he was grieving I would worry about possible manipulation and confusing him. I probably would practice minimal contact too until you learned to respect boundaries. The affair has no relevance to how she raised your brother. Your job right now is to support him emotionally, not to uproot his entire life. If you care about him and have the funds, the best thing for him would be offering to pay for grief counseling, not taking him out of his home.\n\nYTA", "So true!

We\u2019re supposed to trust her telling of events?  She sounds like a monster trying to rip a child away from the only mother he\u2019s only known.  Frankly if I were the mom I\u2019d be saying similar things because THAT\u2019S HER CHILD.  Have some empathy!", "[Not who you asked, but this is what I found when I looked.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133gt0e/-/jibc074)", "Thing is, we don't know what her thoughts are. She MIGHT have an active plan if Jamie leaves.", "Interesting I didn't see that, man that makes me more confused though because she said the parents and brother lived comfortably and have a decent house and income. I honestly feel like there's just bad blood and hurt feelings on both sides, and they need a mediator before things get serious and it becomes too late and a decision is made that hurts that poor boy. I get that op is hurting too, but Jaime is 9 and the poor kid needs support and stability not more hurt and confusion.", "She absolutely might but I'm not talking from opinion here but from experience of the system. The first phrase will get a different response to the second because the first is so common in bereavement groups that unless you draw a line between them you would have to section entire groups.\n\nIt's much like anyone actively planning suicide can increase their chances of success by shutting up. The ones saying \"hi I have a plan\" are the ones with a tiny bit of their mind going \"I'm not sure I want to do this\".", "Reddit is funny, sometimes they'll say how horrible a lot of stepparents are, how they try to erase the bio parents, etc. And now, when OP stands her foot down, and expressing how important is siblings staying together, people are calling her the AH.", "If you want to guarantee your rights, talk to lawyer.  It is possible to allow him to live with his \"mother\" and still have proper rights to keep you and his gparents in his life.  Have a sit down with him after the dust has settled and emotions have calmed a bit.", "highly unlikely if the grandparents are involved. It may be difficult, but no court will give custody to a non biological relative when bio relatives are present and suitable to care for the child. Step mom should have visitation rights, and in the long run the child should be with biological family. nothing about this situation is easy for anyone", "I'm surprised so many people are agreeing with OP. Me and my two older sisters were raised by an adopted dad and if he hadn't been able to do that and my mother died, we all would have been a wreck torn from the person that raised us after losing the other parent.\n\nI get them wanting to be there for their brother and make sure they see him, but it seems like they're projecting a lot. The issues she has with SM (and the *possible* affair) have nothing to do with the little brother. If he's 9, he's old enough to at least be asked who he would feel more comfortable living with. Based on the story, I'd guess he'll likely not want to be taken away from everything he's known and the mother that raised him.\n\nBlood is not everything. I'll die on this hill.", ">your father cheating on your mom was wrong\n\nIf he did actually cheat. OP only suspects it based on the timing. \n\nIt\u2019s not at all unusual for a man to remarry quickly after his wife\u2019s death. That could be the case here.", "Maybe allowing the woman who has previously tried to isolate a child from it's family custody- much less legal parenthood- is a bad move", "No OP, your view has been corrupted by your maternal grandparents. They\u2019re using you against your grieving family to get what they\u2019ve wanted all this time, your brother. I\u2019m sorry to be blunt but she\u2019s his mother even if you only consider her your stepmother. She raised him. \n\nIf you have legal custody as you claimed then she can\u2019t stop you from having visitation. If you push this and go to court, she will probably be granted full custody. If I were in her shoes and my evil stepdaughter and husband\u2019s former inlaws had made my life hell for years then tried to take my child while I was grieving my husband I would go scorched earth on you. \n\nIf you lose access to your brother it will be your own doing, your grandparents are going too far this time. Please talk to a neutral third party about the possibility that your grandparents have been using you as a pawn against your own family this whole time. You didn\u2019t need their help and constant meddling to remember your mom, you were old enough to know and love her. You also need to talk to other family members and ask if they have been this controlling since your mom was alive. What was her relationship with them like?", "You need therapy. Bad. Really bad...", "Forget about whether ppl say YTA or not. Do what you think is best for your brother and get an attorney ASAP. Talk to all of your family members as well. Best of luck to you \ud83d\udc95", "OP doesn't understand what legal guardianship is.  She asked for her brother, was told no, and she says her next step is getting a lawyer.  If she had legal guardian status she could just go get him, no lawyer necessary.\nWhen determining guardianship comes infront of a judge they are going to be most interested in the best interest of the child.  A her brother is going to have a say, and even OP thinks her brother would will say say he wants to stay with the parent who has raised him since his first bday.", "Make sure to document her manipulation for the judge", "Going after inheritance is bottom feeding behavior? This young woman is orphaned; she\u2019s entitled to what her parents left.", "and biological family is the best interest of the child. period. step mom should have visitation and this situation is horrible for everyone, but she's not a biological relative and in the long run, he should be with his parents family", "OP states she is his legal guardian", "She sounds mentally unstable based on that and the fact that she told the child she couldn't live without him.", "Yeah, and honestly if she keeps this up, she won\u2019t even get visitation because mom will be rightfully afraid of parental alienation and possible kidnapping.", "Found family can be a beautiful thing.", "Well. Depends on the state \ud83e\udd23 (I\u2019m kidding, but not. Like in Virginia, last time I checked, children were considered chattel. It\u2019s why you\u2019re legally allowed to give your child alcohol in your own home.)", "Wow. No wonder your father and stepmother reduced contact with them. I can\u2019t imagine their grief for their daughter, but you don\u2019t just get to take a baby from his father. Holy shit. \n\nAlso noticed that a couple of times you say \u201cmy\u201d maternal grandparents vs. \u201cour.\u201d I\u2019m sorry for what you\u2019ve been through and that your mother\u2019s memory wasn\u2019t kept alive more strongly for your brother. But this really sounds like it\u2019s about you, not him.", "Abusing a child is disgusting. She said she \u201ccan\u2019t live without him\u201d HIS FATHER JUST DIED", "she's not his mother. his bio family is his family. they are suitable and want custody. step should have visitation rights", "and he'll be cut off from his biological family and feel like he's adopted? NO. the court will go with biological family every time,because in the long run  that's in his best interest. step mom should have visitation. she's not the childs mother but the parents of the child mother and his adult sibling are ready and willing to care for him and that is in his best interest. none of it will be easy and it's terrible all around, but he's not step mom's child. period.", "as a parent would you want your child to go to a step parent if you had adult , living , loving relatives to care for your child in the event they lost both parents?", "That's my thought, once I could see, but if they wanted her to adopt him multiple times and each time it caused backlash, they probably pulled back each time in the hopes that things would cool down and could resolve a bit before trying again, unfortunately, they kicked the can down the road, not knowing what would happen. It's sad, and him not having a will just makes things more difficult, not that it would solve this situation, but it could help.", "Zero proof that dad had an affair.  For all we know the marriage was on the rocks.  For all we know, mom had an affair herself.", "You realize that a woman stepping into a family and treating a baby like her own even though it didn\u2019t come from her womb is A GOOD THING, right?  Like, that\u2019s seriously Hallmark Movie material.  And you act as if it\u2019s something she should have been punished for.", "It\u2019s giving parental alienation. I\u2019m sure OP\u2019s vitriol and suspecting infidelity came from them.", "I said it\u2019s \u201cby default\u201d as in that\u2019s what happens automatically if you\u2019re a total idiot and don\u2019t estate plan and don\u2019t leave a will. You CAN do whatever you want if you DO leave a will.", "If that step-parent has already been raising the child for years, loves the child as her own and is a good parent? Yes. Anything else would be cruel to both of them.", "Yeah, but it does sound like the stepmom is manipulating him, my mom told me the same things she couldn't live without me, but fuck if she didn't put me through horrible mental trama. I should have been put with my father he's a much much more stable person and never put me through what my mom has. It might suck for the kid for a bit but he might be better off in the long run without a parent telling them they'll die without them and using your child as your support system/therapist is so much worse.", "Ummm\u2026 she didn\u2019t say that.  OP is wildly deflecting and making crap up to make herself look better and her stepmother look worse.  Her brother has one mother, and that\u2019s the woman who raised him.  Wouldn\u2019t YOU be terrified to be separated from your mother?  Wouldn\u2019t YOU be terrified to be separated from your son?  I\u2019m sure the stepmom was FLOORED that OP would even SUGGEST such a crazy and damaging thing.  If anyone is doing the manipulating, it\u2019s OP, and I hope mom stops the online gaming and any other interaction until OP gets some therapy and learns to stay in her lane.", "We don't know what the stepmother actually said verbatim, the only ones who do are the mom and son. It's a difficult situation with high emotions on both sides, and the op and maternal family have clear unresolved issues with the stepmother. There's a serious lack of communication, and what was said could easily be miscommunicated or exaggerated. As others have said it's possible that what was actually said was innocuous and misunderstood or context was left out at any point in the communication of multiple people. The op has said that there was no prior abuse or mistreatment. The only ones who can determine otherwise are the proper authorities, who I'm sure are already involved or keeping watch given the situation. Whatever the outcome, the courts and cps will look at credible evidence and testimony and decide what the best course of action is for the child's wellbeing, no matter what op or anybody else feels. These people are all adults, and regardless of their resentment or unresolved issues, they should be giving support and stability to Jaime, not threatening a custody battle, to the child, asking him who he'll choose, right out of the gate, with little concern for how he feels in all of this and how this will effect him and his life.", "Best advice so far."]}
