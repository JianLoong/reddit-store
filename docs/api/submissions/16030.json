Since our father was always working, I took care of Jaime whenever I wasn't studying for months, and my aunt helped out when I wasn't available. \n\nWhen Jaime was nine months old, our father brought his new girlfriend (now stepmother) to live with us just four months after our mother's death. I didn't get along with her because I suspected that she and our father had been having an affair while our mother was still alive. However, she became Jaime's primary caregiver and raised him like her own son. \n\nAfter a troubled first year we managed to keep our balance by ignoring each otherwe, we only fight when she wanted to legally adopt Jaime (She tried like 5 times), which my maternal grandparents and myself objected to. In the end, my father agreed to wait until Jaime was old enough to decide for himself.  \n\nI went to college in the same city as my maternal grandparents when I was 17, but I visited my brother every weekend that I could. Now, I live in the same city as my grandparents with my boyfriend, and we often play online games with Jaime. \n\nUnfortunately, our father passed away from a sudden illness caused by an unknown heart disease three weeks ago. When I spoke to my stepmother about bringing Jaime to live with me, she didn't react well and said she wouldn't let me take her son. However, I am now Jaime's legal guardian since our father has passed away, and I believe it's in his best interest to live with me in a bigger city with more opportunities and more contact with my maternal grandparents. \n\nMy stepmother has threatened to go to court to adopt my brother, but I plan to look for a lawyer as soon as possible. She also suggested that we let Jaime choose who he wants to live with, but I don't think it's fair to leave such a difficult decision up to a young child. \n\nMy paternal family and stepmother's family are calling me a monster and saying that I want to take a child away from his mother. They also say that I won't know how to discipline him. However, I love Jaime just as much as my stepmother does, and I believe it's in his best interest to live with me. My maternal family and fianc\u00e9 support me, but I'm wondering if AITA?\n\nEDIT: The cities are 3 hours away, I proposed to take him home every other weekend and she can visit him whenever she wants. \n\nEDIT 2:From previous experiences where she tried to stop my brother from spending time with my maternal grandparents I know she would do the same to me.", "created_utc": 1682832793, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133gt0e/aita_for_wanting_custody_of_my_brother_after_my/", "score": 1335, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The first paragraph says he was 5 months old when your mother passed, and then the second says he was 9 years old. How long has he been living with your stepmother, and how old is he now?", "I think even the courts will look for what's best for the child. What does he actually want?", "How old is your brother and what does he want?\n\nHow much money did your dad leave for your brother's care, and is it enough for you to care for him?", "Info: what is actually best for little bro? Does he have problems with step mom? Does he have friends there / enjoy his school? Why would he be better with you?\n\nSounds like (if we are doing what is best for him) rather than taking him away from the person who has raised him most of his life, you could go there for more support. \n\nSeems a bit more like you are doing it because he is rightful property instead of what is really the best thing for him? You can be there for him anyway without uprooting him", "Per your comments, she has been his stepmother since he was 9 months old (or at least in his life since then. For HIM, she is the ONLY Mother he knows. He just lost his Dad too, and now you want to take him from the ONLY mother he has ever known. You haven't lived at home for years. How can you think the best thing for him is to uproot EVERYTHING he knows after losing his Dad. Blood doesn't always make family.\n\nI imagine your Dad had a will. Has this been read yet? What makes you believe you are his legal guardian?\n\nAlso YTA. He would lose everything he knows.", "YTA. From your own words, stepmother has acted in a parental role for Jaime since he was 5 months old. She may not have adopted him legally, but he is his adopted mom regardless. From what you've written, I think you may be letting your hurt over your losing your mom and your anger at the possible affair your dad dad with stepmom overshadow what's best for your brother. Of course your mom can't be erased, but stepmom has been acting as his stepmother for his whole life basically. And now you want to force him to be uprooted after he just lost his dad, and come live with you without even asking Jaime what he wants? That's just cruel. You need to put what's best for your brother ahead of your own emotions regarding your stepmother.", "As far as he is concerned, that is his mother. He was a baby when she came into his life and that is the only mother he has ever known, correct? So his dad died and now you want to take his mother away? If she truly loves him like her own son, I think that would be a heartless thing to do to both of them. Is she not a good mother to him? Or do you just feel you can do better? I am afraid it may do more damage than good to rip him away from the only mother, he's ever known. I understand you were upset that she has tried to erase your mother from his and your lives, but he has no memories of your mother. Only of her. I think it would be emotionally traumatizing for him.", "I\u2019m so sorry for all your losses, OP. This can\u2019t have been an easy path to walk. \n\nNTA. \n\nThe problem is that you haven\u2019t really shown where your step-mom is a bad parent. She\u2019s been parenting Jaime since he was an infant. She\u2019s the only mother he\u2019s ever known. She\u2019s super attached to him and I would hope so! \n\nI get that she\u2019s not your mom and you feel like she was waiting in the wings to swoop in. But idk if that\u2019s a good enough reason to take Jaime away from his mom. \n\nI agree with you that asking Jaime what he wants to do seems a bit much for a 9 year old boy to navigate. If he was 12-13 I\u2019d say to ask his opinion. He is being pulled in two directions and probably doesn\u2019t want anyone to be mad at him or to give the wrong answer. He\u2019s had enough loss. \n\nSo, there can never seem to be a wrong answer if you decide to go the route of asking him. \n\nBoth you and step mom have to get together and agree that no matter what his opinion is you won\u2019t punish him emotionally or hold his opinion against him. And he has to know that. \n\nYou\u2019re both trying to do right by him. This is a hard situation, OP. No one is an asshole here. But please if you do decide to go for custody, bend over backwards to make sure he can see his mom very regularly and that she is a part of his life", "YTA for not talking to your brother about whether or not he wants to upend his life and move somewhere else.  \nYour brother has been at least partly raised by someone he considers his mom. He has a house, a room, and a life. He presumably has friends. He deserves some consideration.  \nIt sounds like you've been at odds with your stepmom from the very beginning, but it doesn't sound like she's really done anything but marry your widowed father and help raise his motherless child. Even if you don't have any feeling for a woman who just lost her husband and now may lose her son, certainly you could have some feeling for your brother about taking him away from his mom.", "YTA for wanting to drag a young child away from his friends, his home, and the only mother he's ever known. \n\nYOUR bad relationship with your stepmom is coloring your view here, and you're projecting that, and trying to put him in the middle of a legal fight while he's grieving, instead of considering his ACTUAL best interests. \n\nPlease stop. I feel for you, but please stop.", "NAH but you should consider that your stepmother is the only mother your brother has ever known. He should definitely have a say in whether he loses the person who has mothered him for 9 years. Just because you don\u2019t have a good relationship with her doesn\u2019t mean he feels that way. Tread carefully. You could be doing a tremendously cruel thing to your brother.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your losses. Your mom's family deserves to see your little brother, and I would totally worry that the stepmother would keep him away from them.", "Your timeline doesn't add up. What's the child want, you didn't mention anything other than yours...?", "YTA. I don\u2019t like what your stepmother said to him, but regardless she\u2019s the only mother he\u2019s ever known. He just lost his father and now you want to take him away from his mother??? I doubt any child would choose that even if she hadn\u2019t said that to him. \n\nSo long as you aren\u2019t leaving out any details such as her being abusive, you would be the asshole, and risk making your brother hate you. \n\nYou can be part of his life and visit, and you should, but taking him away from his mother should be a decision he makes when he\u2019s old enough.", "This woman has raised your brother like her own since he was a few months old. Your dad was hardly wealthy, so it's not like she's using your brother for some big financial gain.\n\nSo, if your mother passed away when Jamie was 5 months old and your dad moved his girlfriend in 4 months later, that means she's been raising Jaimie for over 8 years. \n\nSince then, you've seen Jamie on weekends, you've played online games...but you've never raised a child, full time - that's breakfast, lunch and dinner, that's laundry and cleaning and doctors appointments and taking him to school and back, doing homework, doing play dates and not being able to go out and have fun anywhere near as often as you're doing now. It involves money and sacrifice and energy. Do you work? Does your boyfriend work? What happens if you break up?\n\nAnd yes, I think you *can* and *should* ask your brother and have that discussion; he's young but he can tell you what he wants.\n\nAs for opinions flying left right and centre - of course your maternal grandparents will be against the woman who your dad possibly cheated on their daughter with...but again, this isn't about you or them. It's about a 9 year old boy who has grown up with *this* mother, even if she's not blood related, the feeling for him is the same since he wouldn't have any memory of your bio mother. So he lost his dad and now stands to lose his mom...I can imagine that will mess his up big time. \n\nDon't let your dislike for this woman or whatever assumptions you've made along the way cloud your judgement.", "YTA - you don\u2019t live with Jaime, he just lost his father, how is uprooting him from his home and moving him to a place he doesn\u2019t know going to be beneficial to him?\n\nYou playing games with him, online, and visiting every now and then is not equivalent to a parent who is there every day.", "I\u2019m confused you said you lost your mom when your brother was 5 months old then when your brother is 9 yrs old the girlfriend comes into the picture 4 months after your mothers death ?? That doesn\u2019t make sense", "So sorry you lost your father - what a sad situation. \n\nI think you need to put yourself in your brother\u2019s shoes. It doesn\u2019t sound like your stepmother is so awful it warrants removing your brother from the only home & mother he\u2019s ever known at this point. Taking him away at this point sounds like it would compound the trauma of losing his father. \n\nCan you take a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach. Make sure stepmom is looking out for him. Increase visits in person to keep an eye on things and IF there is evidence (other than not liking this woman) she\u2019s not treating him properly or she tries to prevent you from seeing him - then take a more forceful approach. \n\nAlso - you need to dial in a little more compassion for stepmom. The fact she would be devastated if your brother moves away is a good thing. It means she loves him truly. Try to imagine losing your husband suddenly and then have the possibility of losing a child you raised. That is terrifying and totally devastating. \n\nBe careful about putting brother in the middle. This can be an impossible situation to be in and cause him even more emotional distress. It\u2019s very common for children of divorce to experience trauma from this. \n\nYou need to really think about what\u2019s absolutely best for your brother and put that ahead of your experience and emotions. He\u2019s had a different journey than you and you need to understand where he\u2019s at.", "So your mom died when jamie was 5 months and four months later when jamie was 9 your step mom moved in op can you explain\nEdit: acording to your comments after a year college and an unspecified amount of time he is still nine", "NTA.

If you're able to provide and care for him, and if that's what he wants at this stage in his life, then you can't be an asshole. You're going to be providing what a kid wants and needs.\n\nThat said, you should proceed calmly and without rushing into things. It's going to be a hard time for him already. Change only makes things harder. Make sure he's handling the grieving process and ready to even talk about moving. When he's ready to talk about it, find out what he wants. There are some logistics you'll have to factor in: moving means leaving his friends and starting somewhere new. It may be best to let him finish out his current school year where he is and then get him moved in with you. Losing his friend group like that can make the trauma worse, it can be isolating. Unless he's unhappy with his stepmom, if he's not doing well in that house, then you may have to screw the complications and just move him.", "NTA - If you're the legal guardian, there really isn't any discussion.

As a family lawyer myself i don't know of many judges who would remove a child from the care of a stable adult who has been acting as their parent the majority of their life.

Even though you are your brother's closest living relative you have an uphill climb to prove it is in his best interest to move in with you, in a new city, new school, completely unfamiliar environment.

I'm going to be blunt, that is a very selfish reason to up root a child who just lost their parent.

The stepmother and father are married and have been for several years, and the stepmother has been the primary caregiver for the child for 8.5 years since infancy. Op has stated there's been no abuse or mistreatment, outside of the one recent comment that may not be entirely accurate, and without evidence would be hearsay. The child also has a well established relationship and life with the stepmother, and has suffered trauma recently. The judge or authorities will look at evidence and outside testimony and place children in the best place for them, ideally where there will be the least negative consequences. While they don't make decisions solely based on the child's wishes, they will take them into account, and while 9 may be a little young, he is old enough to give his opinion and for it to have some merrit in terms of custody, in conjunction with other factors such as financial means, parenting ability, safety and comfort.", "you guys are being so ridiculous here man, i cannot believe there is this much widespread sympathy for a suspected homewrecker and her loser husband", "It's not a guarantee, but it's the most likely outcome, and I think op should prepare for that.

He will not understand why he's being taken away from his mother, why he has to leave his home, school, and friends. It will destroy him and his relationship with op and the maternal side of his family. Also while 9 may be considered by some to be a bit young, he's old enough to know what he wants, and if a judge or advocate asks... op has been skirting the questions about what the brother wants, and it's most likely because his answer is like the majority of children's answers when faced with a huge trauma like this.

On top of that you are weaponizing her own grief to strengthen your argument, her telling her son \"I don't know what I'd do without you\" can absolutely be as simple as telling someone you love them and will always be there for them during a time of loss, and you're calling it emotional blackmail.\n\nYTA and You really need to talk to a professional, I worry about you and your brother if these issues are your only focus when both you and him just lost your dad.", "YTA.

They weren't involved in the actual conversation and have no clue what was actually said.", "I meant that my grandparents wanted to spend more time with my brother, at one point they even thought about asking for custody rights, which did not go ahead after an agreement between them and my father", "OP is not the grandparents, and now is not then. Whatever stepmother's reasons were for not wanting the boy to see his grandparents, she did not block OP from seeing him so the situation with the grandparents is not proof that she'd suddenly prevent OP from continuing the sibling relationship. It's a guess based on fear, not on evidence. Now is also very different circumstances, with the loss of her husband and the boy's father. Whatever motivated her then may be different now, especially given that custody is up in the air.  Relatives who reach out to her with empathy have a chance at negotiating a win-win. Relatives who threaten her parental role are just going to ensure she fights them to the bitter end. It's foolish to approach her with hostility, and considering how that puts the child in the middle of warring relatives it's also cruel to this poor kid. I repeat: what happens next is not known, it's guessed, and the way to know is to either negotiate an enforceable agreement or else let a court do it.", "Are you sure? Has anyone provided you with guardianship paperwork, or are you just assuming?", "Legal guardianship and adoption are two different things. She can absolutely have been appointed legal guardianship a very long time ago, and really should've been appointed as it would have been necessary for her to make any medical decisions regarding the kid", "Just like her very emotionally abusing him!! I don\u2019t care how many people down vote me!", "That's exactly the sort of thing that would be appropriate to fight for in court. Get court ordered visitation if you're worried she'll cut you off entirely! *That's* what OP should be fighting for here.", "I would have loved to live with my older sibling in a bigger city. Oh wait- I dropped out of HS & did just that. Went to college early & was exposed to culture.", " Not you. Not your grandparents.", "Yes what the dad did was shitty, and I don't condone it, but the brother per op frequently visits his grandparents and her in the city they live in, and even has cousins who he loves and therefore I assume he spends time with them. Op also says they visit their old house and brother like every other week so idk... I think the op and their mother's family and stepmom need to work out their issues or come up with some sort of solution that doesn't hurt the brother more than he probably already is, or make him choose. From experience that sucks for the kid, and can have lasting consequences. I get being afraid and emotional but that's when you involve a third party like a family therapist to help navigate the situation and communicate with all parties, including explaining and communicating with the child in a safe and effective way that will ideally not potentially traumatize them.", "I mean four months is fast, but grief is weird and does shit to people, I've seen worse than that with confirmation they were not stepping out, so it's dubious that he was cheating, it's entirely possible that he needed emotional support and latched on. While I don't necessarily condone it and it had a negative impact on their family and should have been handled more delicately per this post, they were together this long and she obviously cares for the brother and he supported that. I think it's just a difficult situation all around, and no matter what happens someone is going to be hurt, and I don't want it to be the 9 year old who's just lost his father.", "Here legally birth mother would be erased!", "In my country birth mother vanishes in case of adoption. Not visible on birth certificate anymore!", "Are y'all blind or what. OP literally stated and show how step mom emotionally manipulated brother. Why are y'all fighting.", "Those are terrible reasons to rip him away from the life he knows and the people he loves. Oh no, they're conservative. So what??\n\nHe is 9, he isn't going to become instant friends with some random cousin or automatically bond with the people you like more. He is probably going to just resent you and spiral. You are unbelievablely selfish.", "That's not a good excuse to pull him away from the only home and only mother he has", "Yes, instead of supporting him and reassuring him that everything is ok and he\u2019ll be safe, OP is bombarding a 9 year old with questions about ripping him away from his home.", "The problem with this is we don't know what was said verbatim, the only ones who do are the ones privy to the conversation. As others have pointed out the mother could have said anything and it was miscommunicated at any step or point in time, tensions and emotions are running high on both sides. I'm sure if cps does get involved, they'll determine, along with the courts if there's a custody case, the best course of action for the wellbeing of the brother with whatever evidence and testimony they're presented.", "That was a lapse in judgement from a grieving mother. There is no evidence of abuse or neglect. OP acknowledges that she loves him and that doing this is cruel.", "It doesn't matter If there was cheating, actualy. What kind of pitiful excuse of a father moves a stranger to his kids' life? Four months is barely nothing to move someone to a house you share with your grieving teenager daugher. What a horrible father...", "For me it\u2019s down to letting the kid be raised by an emotionally manipulative stepmom who cares more about herself then the kid, or letting the kid be raised by sister while having (supervised) contact with stepmom. I\u2019ll take a loving sister over a narc stepmom any day of the week. Either way, he is going to need therapy.", "Same in Germany birth certificate only states the adoptive parents. And nothing else. Nobody can see from the new birth certificate that you are adopted. That's the reason you need another certificate before you get married. This \"certificate of origin\" states your birth parents (if know), not the adoptive ones. This is to avoid marriage between siblings (who don't know they are). So if you are interested in the name of your birth parents, you need this, not a birth certificate.", "Look, OP, what I\u2019m seeing here is that you and your stepmother have a terrible relationship, and that you\u2019re worried if she gets custody of your brother she\u2019ll interfere with your relationship. But what I\u2019m not seeing is any concern that she\u2019ll mistreat your brother or that he\u2019ll grow up in a bad environment. Sadly, it\u2019s possible for parents to be good parents to one kid and bad parents to another. The question you need to ask yourself is, will she be a good parent to him?\n\nFor better or for worse, she is his mother in every way that matters. He just lost his father, taking him away from his mother, home, and friends would be an additional huge trauma. And while I get you\u2019re concerned that the stepmother will interfere in your relationship, has she ever really gone the extra mile like lying to him about you, lying about his/your availability, actively interfering while you\u2019re spending time together? Because if she doesn\u2019t go that far, you should be able to maintain a relationship with him as long as you\u2019re pushy about it. \n\nThen I\u2019m seeing that you\u2019re only financially stable while your grandparents give you a place stay. You realize if you take custody of your brother, YOU are responsible for him. You\u2019ll have to take him to the doctor, feed him, take him to school, and be a parent to him, while he\u2019s adjusting to a massive change and loss. Practically speaking, can you take care of him?\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this position OP, it really doesn\u2019t sound like there was much effort on your dad\u2019s or stepmom\u2019s part to carefully blend families, but I hope you choose what\u2019s best for your brother, whatever that ends up being.", "This isn't hard. She's his mom. She's raised him since he was under a year old. He should be with her. You should have regular contact as should your grandparents. Get a formal custody agreement in place which guarantees you and your grandparents regular visitation in exchange for not pursuing custody in court. If she's genuinely afraid of losing him that shouldn't be difficult to get her to agree to.", "OP I don\u2019t know how else to say this, but your dad gave you responsibility you shouldn\u2019t have had at 14. It sounds like your step mother set things right in that instance. Maybe she didn\u2019t discuss it with you correctly, but that wasn\u2019t her job as a new partner. It was your fathers job to explain to you that you\u2019re not a \u201cdecoration\u201d but a child. A child generally doesn\u2019t make household decisions or take on the caregiver role for other children. Maybe she didn\u2019t come into your life the right way, and it certainly seems like neither of you did much to mend that which is okay. This is common with children who were parentified though, to feel like they are responsible for- or even would be the best choice for- raising the younger sibling. They often butt heads with the parenting style of the new partner because they feel like they have an inherent right to have a voice in the matter. You didn\u2019t though. You were a child. No one blames you for being angry with the step parent, but some of the responsibility of this situation lands on your dad too.\n\nTo be Frank here, you\u2019re trying to uproot a 9 year old from everything they\u2019ve ever known solely over that grudge. You keep using her saying she can\u2019t live without him as the reason, and I\u2019m telling you, if your only reason is a grief stricken parent using a poor choice of words to express her care over a child she raised you\u2019re gonna lose in court. You seem to think you\u2019re the better environment because you and your grandparents feel alienated without caring about what\u2019s actually best or what actions you took that led to you not being able to have a full relationship with that child. Not one thing you\u2019ve stated here has led me to believe that the step parent isn\u2019t a good environment for that child. In fact, as a parent myself, if someone was trying to overstep and threatening to take away a child I raised while he was grieving I would worry about possible manipulation and confusing him. I probably would practice minimal contact too until you learned to respect boundaries. The affair has no relevance to how she raised your brother. Your job right now is to support him emotionally, not to uproot his entire life. If you care about him and have the funds, the best thing for him would be offering to pay for grief counseling, not taking him out of his home.\n\nYTA", "So true! OP is way more concerned about herself and shows no concern at all about how the 9 year old feels about being forced away from his mother after his father just died.

I highly recommend op to look into counseling for, if not everyone, at least the brother if they haven't already.

Good grief.  He\u2019s not a toy.  He\u2019s lived with her for his entire life.  Sister is more of a \u201cstep\u201d relative than she is.

But, you also have to remember when your dad invited her to live in his home and marry her that it became HER home as well. Your mom\u2019s memory should be alive and well in you. \nYou have no way of knowing what your parents relationship was like before she passed.  That was between them and maybe he was cheating. Maybe their marriage was dead long before she actually passed. It doesn\u2019t give him an excuse but life is not a straight line. It is not always black and white. There are gray areas. \nYour step mom can not and should not have to live in your mom\u2019s shadow and deserved to have a home she enjoys being in decorated in her style. She stepped up to the plate and loves your brother. She may have been able to be there for you but you didn\u2019t give her a chance and that\u2019s okay. You were old enough to make that choice. But, remember. Loving another parent doesn\u2019t make you a traitor to your dead mother.  Letting him remain in the care of a loving parent doesn\u2019t make you a traitor to your dead mother. If you love your brother take yourself out of the equation and ask yourself what is the actual best thing for him? You are young. Kids are hard. Try getting every other weekend visitation and go from there. Even if you get custody he deserves a slow and smooth transition not having his life ripped apart because it helps soothe some pain you have in your life. \n\nYour brother will resent this and will act out because he just lost two parents and all his friends and local support system. It will not be easy. Being a mother means always putting the kid first.", "She keeps pushing her agenda over what is best for him. She pushed for an adoption 5 times.
