Since our father was always working, I took care of Jaime whenever I wasn't studying for months, and my aunt helped out when I wasn't available. \n\nWhen Jaime was nine months old, our father brought his new girlfriend (now stepmother) to live with us just four months after our mother's death. I didn't get along with her because I suspected that she and our father had been having an affair while our mother was still alive. However, she became Jaime's primary caregiver and raised him like her own son. \n\nAfter a troubled first year we managed to keep our balance by ignoring each otherwe, we only fight when she wanted to legally adopt Jaime (She tried like 5 times), which my maternal grandparents and myself objected to. In the end, my father agreed to wait until Jaime was old enough to decide for himself.  \n\nI went to college in the same city as my maternal grandparents when I was 17, but I visited my brother every weekend that I could. Now, I live in the same city as my grandparents with my boyfriend, and we often play online games with Jaime. \n\nUnfortunately, our father passed away from a sudden illness caused by an unknown heart disease three weeks ago. When I spoke to my stepmother about bringing Jaime to live with me, she didn't react well and said she wouldn't let me take her son. However, I am now Jaime's legal guardian since our father has passed away, and I believe it's in his best interest to live with me in a bigger city with more opportunities and more contact with my maternal grandparents. \n\nMy stepmother has threatened to go to court to adopt my brother, but I plan to look for a lawyer as soon as possible. She also suggested that we let Jaime choose who he wants to live with, but I don't think it's fair to leave such a difficult decision up to a young child. \n\nMy paternal family and stepmother's family are calling me a monster and saying that I want to take a child away from his mother. They also say that I won't know how to discipline him. However, I love Jaime just as much as my stepmother does, and I believe it's in his best interest to live with me. My maternal family and fianc\u00e9 support me, but I'm wondering if AITA?\n\nEDIT: The cities are 3 hours away, I proposed to take him home every other weekend and she can visit him whenever she wants. \n\nEDIT 2:From previous experiences where she tried to stop my brother from spending time with my maternal grandparents I know she would do the same to me.", "created_utc": 1682832793, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/133gt0e/aita_for_wanting_custody_of_my_brother_after_my/", "score": 171, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The first paragraph says he was 5 months old when your mother passed, and then the second says he was 9 years old. How long has he been living with your stepmother, and how old is he now?", "I think even the courts will look for what's best for the child. What does he actually want?", "How old is your brother and what does he want?\n\nHow much money did your dad leave for your brother's care, and is it enough for you to care for him?", "Info: what is actually best for little bro? Does he have problems with step mom? Does he have friends there / enjoy his school? Why would he be better with you?\n\nSounds like (if we are doing what is best for him) rather than taking him away from the person who has raised him most of his life, you could go there for more support. \n\nSeems a bit more like you are doing it because he is rightful property instead of what is really the best thing for him? You can be there for him anyway without uprooting him", "Per your comments, she has been his stepmother since he was 9 months old (or at least in his life since then. For HIM, she is the ONLY Mother he knows. He just lost his Dad too, and now you want to take him from the ONLY mother he has ever known. You haven't lived at home for years. How can you think the best thing for him is to uproot EVERYTHING he knows after losing his Dad. Blood doesn't always make family.\n\nI imagine your Dad had a will. Has this been read yet? What makes you believe you are his legal guardian?\n\nAlso YTA. He would lose everything he knows.", "YTA. From your own words, stepmother has acted in a parental role for Jaime since he was 5 months old. She may not have adopted him legally, but he is his adopted mom regardless. From what you've written, I think you may be letting your hurt over your losing your mom and your anger at the possible affair your dad dad with stepmom overshadow what's best for your brother. Of course your mom can't be erased, but stepmom has been acting as his stepmother for his whole life basically. And now you want to force him to be uprooted after he just lost his dad, and come live with you without even asking Jaime what he wants? That's just cruel. You need to put what's best for your brother ahead of your own emotions regarding your stepmother.", "As far as he is concerned, that is his mother. He was a baby when she came into his life and that is the only mother he has ever known, correct? So his dad died and now you want to take his mother away? If she truly loves him like her own son, I think that would be a heartless thing to do to both of them. Is she not a good mother to him? Or do you just feel you can do better? I am afraid it may do more damage than good to rip him away from the only mother, he's ever known. I understand you were upset that she has tried to erase your mother from his and your lives, but he has no memories of your mother. Only of her. I think it would be emotionally traumatizing for him.", "I\u2019m so sorry for all your losses, OP. This can\u2019t have been an easy path to walk. \n\nNTA. \n\nThe problem is that you haven\u2019t really shown where your step-mom is a bad parent. She\u2019s been parenting Jaime since he was an infant. She\u2019s the only mother he\u2019s ever known. She\u2019s super attached to him and I would hope so! \n\nI get that she\u2019s not your mom and you feel like she was waiting in the wings to swoop in. But idk if that\u2019s a good enough reason to take Jaime away from his mom. \n\nI agree with you that asking Jaime what he wants to do seems a bit much for a 9 year old boy to navigate. If he was 12-13 I\u2019d say to ask his opinion. He is being pulled in two directions and probably doesn\u2019t want anyone to be mad at him or to give the wrong answer. He\u2019s had enough loss. \n\nSo, there can never seem to be a wrong answer if you decide to go the route of asking him. \n\nBoth you and step mom have to get together and agree that no matter what his opinion is you won\u2019t punish him emotionally or hold his opinion against him. And he has to know that. \n\nYou\u2019re both trying to do right by him. This is a hard situation, OP. No one is an asshole here. But please if you do decide to go for custody, bend over backwards to make sure he can see his mom very regularly and that she is a part of his life", "YTA for not talking to your brother about whether or not he wants to upend his life and move somewhere else.  \nYour brother has been at least partly raised by someone he considers his mom. He has a house, a room, and a life. He presumably has friends. He deserves some consideration.  \nIt sounds like you've been at odds with your stepmom from the very beginning, but it doesn't sound like she's really done anything but marry your widowed father and help raise his motherless child. Even if you don't have any feeling for a woman who just lost her husband and now may lose her son, certainly you could have some feeling for your brother about taking him away from his mom.", "YTA for wanting to drag a young child away from his friends, his home, and the only mother he's ever known. \n\nYOUR bad relationship with your stepmom is coloring your view here, and you're projecting that, and trying to put him in the middle of a legal fight while he's grieving, instead of considering his ACTUAL best interests. \n\nPlease stop. I feel for you, but please stop.", "NAH but you should consider that your stepmother is the only mother your brother has ever known. He should definitely have a say in whether he loses the person who has mothered him for 9 years. Just because you don\u2019t have a good relationship with her doesn\u2019t mean he feels that way. Tread carefully. You could be doing a tremendously cruel thing to your brother.", "NTA. I'm sorry for your losses. Your mom's family deserves to see your little brother, and I would totally worry that the stepmother would keep him away from them.", "Your timeline doesn't add up. What's the child want, you didn't mention anything other than yours...?", "YTA. I don\u2019t like what your stepmother said to him, but regardless she\u2019s the only mother he\u2019s ever known. He just lost his father and now you want to take him away from his mother??? I doubt any child would choose that even if she hadn\u2019t said that to him. \n\nSo long as you aren\u2019t leaving out any details such as her being abusive, you would be the asshole, and risk making your brother hate you. \n\nYou can be part of his life and visit, and you should, but taking him away from his mother should be a decision he makes when he\u2019s old enough.", "This woman has raised your brother like her own since he was a few months old. Your dad was hardly wealthy, so it's not like she's using your brother for some big financial gain.\n\nSo, if your mother passed away when Jamie was 5 months old and your dad moved his girlfriend in 4 months later, that means she's been raising Jaimie for over 8 years. \n\nSince then, you've seen Jamie on weekends, you've played online games...but you've never raised a child, full time - that's breakfast, lunch and dinner, that's laundry and cleaning and doctors appointments and taking him to school and back, doing homework, doing play dates and not being able to go out and have fun anywhere near as often as you're doing now. It involves money and sacrifice and energy. Do you work? Does your boyfriend work? What happens if you break up?\n\nAnd yes, I think you *can* and *should* ask your brother and have that discussion; he's young but he can tell you what he wants.\n\nAs for opinions flying left right and centre - of course your maternal grandparents will be against the woman who your dad possibly cheated on their daughter with...but again, this isn't about you or them. It's about a 9 year old boy who has grown up with *this* mother, even if she's not blood related, the feeling for him is the same since he wouldn't have any memory of your bio mother. So he lost his dad and now stands to lose his mom...I can imagine that will mess his up big time. \n\nDon't let your dislike for this woman or whatever assumptions you've made along the way cloud your judgement.", "YTA - you don\u2019t live with Jaime, he just lost his father, how is uprooting him from his home and moving him to a place he doesn\u2019t know going to be beneficial to him?\n\nYou playing games with him, online, and visiting every now and then is not equivalent to a parent who is there every day.", "I\u2019m confused you said you lost your mom when your brother was 5 months old then when your brother is 9 yrs old the girlfriend comes into the picture 4 months after your mothers death ?? That doesn\u2019t make sense", "So sorry you lost your father - what a sad situation. \n\nI think you need to put yourself in your brother\u2019s shoes. It doesn\u2019t sound like your stepmother is so awful it warrants removing your brother from the only home & mother he\u2019s ever known at this point. Taking him away at this point sounds like it would compound the trauma of losing his father. \n\nCan you take a \u2018wait and see\u2019 approach. Make sure stepmom is looking out for him. Increase visits in person to keep an eye on things and IF there is evidence (other than not liking this woman) she\u2019s not treating him properly or she tries to prevent you from seeing him - then take a more forceful approach. \n\nAlso - you need to dial in a little more compassion for stepmom. The fact she would be devastated if your brother moves away is a good thing. It means she loves him truly. Try to imagine losing your husband suddenly and then have the possibility of losing a child you raised. That is terrifying and totally devastating. \n\nBe careful about putting brother in the middle. This can be an impossible situation to be in and cause him even more emotional distress. It\u2019s very common for children of divorce to experience trauma from this. \n\nYou need to really think about what\u2019s absolutely best for your brother and put that ahead of your experience and emotions. He\u2019s had a different journey than you and you need to understand where he\u2019s at.", "So your mom died when jamie was 5 months and four months later when jamie was 9 your step mom moved in op can you explain\nEdit: acording to your comments after a year college and an unspecified amount of time he is still nine", "NTA.

If you're able to provide and care for him, and if that's what he wants at this stage in his life, then you can't be an asshole. You're going to be providing what a kid wants and needs.\n\nThat said, you should proceed calmly and without rushing into things. It's going to be a hard time for him already. Change only makes things harder. Make sure he's handling the grieving process and ready to even talk about moving. When he's ready to talk about it, find out what he wants. There are some logistics you'll have to factor in: moving means leaving his friends and starting somewhere new. It may be best to let him finish out his current school year where he is and then get him moved in with you. Losing his friend group like that can make the trauma worse, it can be isolating. Unless he's unhappy with his stepmom, if he's not doing well in that house, then you may have to screw the complications and just move him.", "NTA - If you're the legal guardian, there really isn't any discussion.

He has friends, a home that isn\u2019t just the house but the whole neighbourhood", "i don\u2019t think you\u2019re being TA. from your comments, it becomes hard for me to sympathise with this lady. she supposedly had an affair with a married man, entered his and his children\u2019s home only *months* after his wife died, and tried to play happy families by raising the infant child and attempting to adopt him, thus erasing his birth mother\u2019s name on his certificate. your dad is also TA for not questioning how she treated you and having the affair too, no absolving him of blame here. now everyone is telling you you have no right to absolutely despise her and that her grief should be taken into account. it becomes hard to really sympathise with someone who did stuff so egregious to a 16 year old. if jaime was any older than an infant at the time, i doubt he would\u2019ve had her affections much either.\n\nalso you said that she will definitely attempt to alienate you from jaime if she gets custody, and i believe you. she tried it once with your mom\u2019s family already. i will say, just ask jaime for his opinion. her treating him so much better than you growing up sucks, but he didn\u2019t remember his birth mom so he\u2019s in a *really* tough spot. if, in the future, he ever asks why you dislike her so much, tell him the truth about it, but for now, if she\u2019s a genuinely decent person to him, let the courts do their thing.\n\nseems a lot of you have never been older siblings before. the older sister can be just as good of a parent as the stepmom. and judging by how stepmom treated you, i don\u2019t think we can even afford her the grace of being called a \u201cgood parent\u201d at all. there\u2019s a strange amount of sympathy for her here. she lost her husband but YOU lost your father AND mother. \n\nNTA.", "It\u2019s government paperwork, he was 5 months old, you\u2019re projecting your sentimentality and the relationship you had with your mother onto your brother.\n\nYour mother isn\u2019t erased just because your stepmother adopts your brother\n\nYou\u2019re not actually thinking about his best interest but what rather how you want some storybook version of your lives to go", "Taking your moms name of what? His birth certificate? No, her name will still be there. That doesn't change. The adoption paperwork is a completely different thing and just lists her as the legal parent now. \n\nBut have you considered why she may not want you to have too much contact with him? You obviously don't like her, so why would she want her son to be around someone who hates her? \n\nYou both love Jamie, so have you tried to sit down with her and talk to her, not Jamie, about what is best for him? To work together to ensure he has the best life? \n\nIf you want to the sister he needs, put aside your hate for the person he calls mom, and stop making him feel like he has to choose between the two of you.", "I love how you just blame her for everything, like your Father wasn\u2019t there for the whole thing", "They may not have treated her badly, but did they ever make her feel welcome? Like she was not an outsider? \n\nIt is really unreasonable to not want your child to go with someone who you feel doesn't like you? \n\nNot saying stepmom was right all the time, just trying to get you to see things from her point of view. Hopefully someone will try to get her to see things from your point of view.", "So she saw her husband, the man she loved, getting hate from your maternal grandparents and you think she wouldn\u2019t be a Bit miffed about it?\n\nThere\u2019s also a huge difference between bad treatment and cold indifference or dismissal but both won\u2019t make someone want to be around you", "Do you really think she could not tell she was not liked, that her presence was not welcome? Your grandparents may have shown anger to your dad, but I can bet you she knew full well that she was the source of that anger. And that would make anyone not feel welcome. If that feeling was never addressed, and she never felt like she was accepted by your grandparents, it's not hard to understand as a parent not wanting your child to be around people who hate you. \n\nAgain, not saying she was right, just providing perspective. \n\nAlso, on those days she would disappear with your brother, what did your dad say about them? What was his response to your grandparents?", "He is 9. That is his MOTHER. Yes that is kidnapping. You\u2019re ripping him away from the only mother he has know. It is a horrible decision you\u2019re making. Want to see him? Ask for visitation, not full custody. The trauma you\u2019re going to inflict on this poor child is unimaginable.", "Yes I could I could pay, as I don't pay rent there is a good amount of my salary, and I would be willing to change my life", "I never said that he needs to choose, I initially talked to my stepmother alone, she was the one who then spoke to my brother without me knowing that she would not live without him if he left\n\nHonestly, I believe I have reasons to dislike her. For four months my aunt and I shared the responsibilities with my brother, I was 14, and then a woman I had never seen before Suddenly, she comes to live at my house and from the first day she treats the baby as if it were hers. Tries to stop my maternal grandparents from living with him, and pretends I'm a decoration in the house with no opinion. \n\nWhen I tried to sit down and talk with her she was soon trying to manipulate my brother and talk to my paternal family.\n\nYou know I'm not a monster, I know how important they are to each other, I don't intend to stop them from seeing each other, they're 3 hours away between cities, weekly visits are possible. I can guarantee that I won't get in the way of seeing each other, but I know from past experience that she will try to do just that.", "In fact, I blame him, I even talked about it in another comment", "This has been going on since day 1, I don't know what my dad said to her but she always acted like his mom, She did this when she still only knew my brother a few months.\n\nMy grandparents had no reason to make her feel welcome, they just treated her with respect. Even because she was the person who make their granddaughter (me) feel bad..\n\nWe all (me, my family) know that the real guilty is my father, but unfortunately he is no longer here to answer for his actions", "He usually went looking for her, told her not to do that anymore, it worked for a month, then she did something like that and the cycle repeated\nHe gave in to one person at a time and thus evaded responsibility", "He has a mother who loves him and you\u2019re trying to pull her away from him solely because it\u2019s what you think is best for him despite acknowledging that your father wanted her to adopt him years ago. He\u2019s lost one parent and you\u2019re trying to take away the other, you can\u2019t just step in and replace your stepmother as the main mother figure in his life because **you** don\u2019t like the one he has and **you** think he would be better off. Just because you think you could be a mother figure for him doesn\u2019t mean you can snap your fingers and take the place of the one he already has. You\u2019re setting him up for major emotional issues down the road if you keep trying to force them apart. \n\nYou should absolutely have visitation and you have every right to be a part of his life but you can\u2019t replace the woman who has spent the last 9 years raising him like her own son just because you want to. The fact that you don\u2019t see anything wrong with moving him away not only from his main maternal/parental figure but from his friends and school right after losing his father really speaks to your maturity and inability to put his needs first. You\u2019re putting the memory of your mother in front of the needs of your brother. Support the nuclear family he already has, stop trying to rip away from the only other parent he has ever know. Yes, you lost your father but so did he. He\u2019s grieving too and he needs the woman he considers his mom. \n\nYou\u2019re trying to be kind when in reality what you\u2019re doing is exceptionally cruel, both to him and your stepmother.", "What if you marry someone who is for him what she was to you? YTA.", "So you do rely on your maternal grandparents and they would be paying to house you both.\n\nSo, if they could no longer house the both of you, could you afford it still?", "I really think your dad did a shitty way of introducing your stepmother, and I really do get why you don't like her, I wouldn't either. She might be the evil stepmother or she is a good mother to your brother, that I don't know. I do now that you seem to be acting out of your own emotions a bit more than might be good for your brother. None of you should be hasty in this and non of you should tak to each other without some kind of counselling present. I'm sorry for losing your mom and I'm sorry for losing your dad. I get that you are terrified of loosing your brother. However this resolves, some states in the US seems to have legal ways of sharing custody and visitation and  such between people, grand parents etc, and I think for your brothers sake that you all should look in to it.", "Maybe she isn\u2019t manipulative though, sounds like she\u2019s genuine as there is no alternative benefit to her keeping him other than her love and parental bond.\n\nIt\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to get a big pay out or something", "I don't think you're a monster. I think you love your brother, and that you are hurting from losing your dad. \n\nI do think you reacting very emotionally, which is understandable. And while you have not told him to choose, you are still making him do so. If you go to court over this, the judge will talk to him, and at some point, on some level he will be asked what he wants, where he is happy, or some sort of question between the two of you. And that is not fair to him. \n\nAlso, having had to deal with custody court, I do think you will lose if it goes to a judge. She has been his defacto parent his entire life, your dad wanted her to adopt, he has a life build there, with her. If you go to court, and drag this thing out, when it is all settled, there will be irreparable harm done  between you and your step mom. That will pretty much guarantee she will cut contact with you. \n\nSo I urge you to sit down with her, not to tell her you want to take Jamie to live with you, but to figure out how to best support him. You don't have like each other, just work together to be there for him.", "So this is about punishment then? You want to hurt someone because you were hurt? \n\nThis is not me judging you, so please don't fell like I am. \n\nBut her acting as like his mom from the jump, taking care of a near 1 yr old, is that really a bad thing. Yes, you were doing for 4 months, helping take care of him, but you were 14. While it is great you stepped up, you will still a child yourself, who had also lost her mom. That kind of burden should not have been yours to carry. \n\nI can get how you would feel like it was, and that you might have felt like you needed to take over the role your mother had. \n\nLook, I am just an internet stranger and my opinion doesn't mean much to you, but I want you to know I am proud you. Proud of the love you show for your brother, proud of that you are fighting for him. \n\nYou love your brother, and you are a good sister. Your mother would be proud as well.", "Your brother was only a few months! Not even a year old! It would have been neglectful for her not to."]}
