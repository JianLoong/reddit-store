The cost of \"modern life\" is also two incomes. She can get a job.  Get a spreadsheet and go over numbers and ask how she wants to make it all work. Her family and friend don't know the whole story most likely.", "No dude. NTA.  Your wife is overspending the household funds. Delivery services cost money just like everything else. My fianc\u00e9 and I started to fall down this trap and realized we were spending several hundred dollars every month while other debts were neglected. We got our shit together and now your wife needs to.", "NTA Her family and friends don't get a vote in your finances.  Spread sheets and ask her how she would like to make it all work to be cost effective.", "NTA. Delivery services plus the cost of the food often cost many times more than a homemade meal. Unless there\u2019s some major factor I\u2019m missing like wife doing a lot of child or elder care, it sounds like she has time to pick it up herself or shop and cook.\n\nAlso framing it as the cost of a \u201cmodern life\u201d made me roll my eyes. My SO and I both work full time and could afford to get delivery and eat out more than we do but see it as a waste of money since we\u2019re plenty able to cook or pick up food ourselves for a heck of a lot less.\n\nIt could be helpful to crunch the numbers and show how much is really being spent. Have a discussion about what you value (saving for a safety net or retirement, being able to afford certain things to improve quality of life) and how the delivery habit impacts that.", "NTA! Wife, family, and friends should realize that \u201cmodern day\u201d is getting expensive and keeps piling up.", "NTA. My husband works in banking. You would not believe how many people can\u2019t pay their rent but use door dash every day. It has nothing to do with modern life. Too many people don\u2019t understand what a budget is. Your bills don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re feeling lazy. \n\nLearn how to cook. It\u2019s cheaper and generally better for you. With a little effort you can make good, healthy meals. Your wife can grow up and stop bringing people into personal arguments. I have zero patience for this. I\u2019m currently a SAHM too with two little kids. She\u2019s not holding up her end of the deal.", "NTA that is not the cost of \u201cmodern living\u201d delivery like door dash and post mates have high fees and if she\u2019s not helping with that then she shouldn\u2019t be ordering from all of that. Also her friends and family have no business putting their two cents in your finances. If they aren\u2019t paying your bills then they don\u2019t have an opinion.\nI would cut her off.

Sounds like she needs a job.", "NTA. These food delivery things are the best way to blow all of y\u2019all\u2019s money.

Her friends and family are being ridiculous and just enabling her poor behavior.", "is it her money or your money she spending? \n\neither way though, this is not a healthy lifestyle I know it because I lived it at one point.

Maybe every once in a while if you're too drunk or don't have a car. But I consider it a luxury and a shitty one at that. Total waste of money. Especially for 5 people or more. She should make the list if she doesn't like what you buy. I don't want to judge because I don't have kids and I don't know her life. Does she drive? Does she have a chronic pain disorder that causes fatigue? Is she abnormally tired all the time? There could be a health issue there. Otherwise... hate to say it but she's lazy and a bit entitled.", "That's a simple but good idea.  I did kind of consider it.  I think I should", "Home made 2-5$. Meal kit 5-10$.

Very capable physically.  If she wants to be!\n\nIt is a bit of both I agree.", "Meal planning can be exhausting, but restaurant food is so expensive, even more so when delivered. One thing we lean on is Costco. Now, I personally hate the Costco experience BUT a huge convenience is their premade meals. You just pop them in the oven for like 30 mins. I love to cook but with kids and work sometimes im so wiped at the end of the day. \n\nThey are decent quality and a fraction of the price of takeout/delivery. I dart it, grab a few, and get out! \n\nYou need to sit down and look at hard numbers with her. She likely will be shocked that she is spending thousands per month on delivery. People who overspend are very good at justifying expenditures and don\u2019t keep a mental tab of how much it adds up to. Good luck!", "that is a very great mindset to have on your end, keep it up. \n\nThere's really not a lot I can tell you because she's a grown adult and make decisions for herself. There is no way she doesn't know how it disbenefits herself and the family. It's a change and decision she has to make for herself. But kudos to you for being by her side and coming up with ideas to help her.", "Can you set a budget for household expenses? Or some type of set-up for fun money budget for each of you. Then it is not about her having to order less, and more about her deciding how she wants to spend the money she has in the budget? \n\nShe might not realize how much she is spending or you might not understand how she is prioritizing the delivery in terms of budget.", "There is a budget for sure.  And she has become pretty used to blowing it up.  Maybe I need to start sending more into savings so it can't be touched."]}
