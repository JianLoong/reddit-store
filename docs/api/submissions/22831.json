Unless there\u2019s some major factor I\u2019m missing like wife doing a lot of child or elder care, it sounds like she has time to pick it up herself or shop and cook.\n\nAlso framing it as the cost of a \u201cmodern life\u201d made me roll my eyes. My SO and I both work full time and could afford to get delivery and eat out more than we do but see it as a waste of money since we\u2019re plenty able to cook or pick up food ourselves for a heck of a lot less.\n\nIt could be helpful to crunch the numbers and show how much is really being spent. Have a discussion about what you value (saving for a safety net or retirement, being able to afford certain things to improve quality of life) and how the delivery habit impacts that.", "NTA!

Your bills don\u2019t give a shit if you\u2019re feeling lazy. \n\nLearn how to cook. It\u2019s cheaper and generally better for you. With a little effort you can make good, healthy meals. Your wife can grow up and stop bringing people into personal arguments. I have zero patience for this. I\u2019m currently a SAHM too with two little kids. She\u2019s not holding up her end of the deal.", "NTA that is not the cost of \u201cmodern living\u201d delivery like door dash and post mates have high fees and if she\u2019s not helping with that then she shouldn\u2019t be ordering from all of that. Also her friends and family have no business putting their two cents in your finances. If they aren\u2019t paying your bills then they don\u2019t have an opinion.\nI would cut her off.

Maybe every once in a while if you're too drunk or don't have a car. But I consider it a luxury and a shitty one at that. Total waste of money. Especially for 5 people or more. She should make the list if she doesn't like what you buy. I don't want to judge because I don't have kids and I don't know her life. Does she drive? Does she have a chronic pain disorder that causes fatigue? Is she abnormally tired all the time? There could be a health issue there. Otherwise... hate to say it but she's lazy and a bit entitled.", "That's a simple but good idea.  I did kind of consider it.  I think I should", "Home made 2-5$. Meal kit 5-10$. Restaurant meal 15-20$. Delivery 30$+", "We have 3 kids.  But.  Tbf.  Everyone is in school.

She has full access to it even if I'm the \"bread winner\".", "I do a huge portion of the cooking.  I used to do it as a job so no complaints there.  But I work in IT now and often get home after dinner.  I eat alot of sandwiches.", "She does have some health issues but it's nothing new and she used to be in the military.  Very capable physically.  If she wants to be!\n\nIt is a bit of both I agree.", "Meal planning can be exhausting, but restaurant food is so expensive, even more so when delivered. One thing we lean on is Costco. Now, I personally hate the Costco experience BUT a huge convenience is their premade meals. You just pop them in the oven for like 30 mins. I love to cook but with kids and work sometimes im so wiped at the end of the day. \n\nThey are decent quality and a fraction of the price of takeout/delivery. I dart it, grab a few, and get out! \n\nYou need to sit down and look at hard numbers with her. She likely will be shocked that she is spending thousands per month on delivery. People who overspend are very good at justifying expenditures and don\u2019t keep a mental tab of how much it adds up to. Good luck!", "that is a very great mindset to have on your end, keep it up. \n\nThere's really not a lot I can tell you because she's a grown adult and make decisions for herself. There is no way she doesn't know how it disbenefits herself and the family. It's a change and decision she has to make for herself. But kudos to you for being by her side and coming up with ideas to help her.", "Can you set a budget for household expenses? Or some type of set-up for fun money budget for each of you.

And she has become pretty used to blowing it up.  Maybe I need to start sending more into savings so it can't be touched.", "NTA some people have to see things visually. Add the money she is spending and show her what else you could have for that money. In X amount of months we could have a vacation/upgrade car or whatever she wants. Its easy for people to lose track of what they are spending, just click a few buttons and food arrives. I point blank refuse to use these services, I have a take out around once a fortnight and I go collect.

Not to mention that food is priced higher in the app than at the actual restaurant. Not cost of modern living at all, just greedy corporations trying to get more $$$.", "NTA\n\nremove her access to credit cards", "You could try Dave Ramsey\u2019s rules for budgeting with a spouse, which are 1. the person with greater interest in budgeting makes the budget.  I suggest using You Need A Budget (YNAB).  2.  Have a kid-free budget meeting before month begins to review the (next month\u2019s) budget.  3.  The budgeter thanks the spouse for being there.   4.  The spouse needs to change at least one thing in the budget.   5. Both people agree on budget and promise to keep it or discuss it if changes need to be made.  \n\nIf it makes it easier, you could move all the $ for fixed expenses, retirement, kids college & other stuff you have agreed to save for to an account that is harder to take $ out of.  I\u2019m not saying your wife shouldn\u2019t have access or that you should do this unilaterally, just that spending it shouldn\u2019t be frictionless.  Leave in checking only what you both have agreed to spend that month + a small cushion so you don\u2019t overdraw account.  Of course that assumes you don\u2019t use credit cards.  \n\nAlso I recommend taking Dave Ramsey\u2019s Financial Peace University course with your wife, either in person or online.", "NTA, I personally hate shopping so I order groceries through the store apps and then do curbside pick up. No delivery fees, I don't have to shop just bring them home and put them away. Delivery fees are crazy", "NTA! Me and my partner where in a similar situation not to long ago. Our schedules weren't lining up and we would only have about 2.5 hours a evening to do anything together and both of our jobs were very physical so the last thing we wanted to do was cook then clean everything up, and we were being lazy lol. But I got a new job that was better for me and less hours, but less hours means less money so I was very serious when I said no more ordering food! And we have been doing great and saving a ton of money! And there are so many easy weeknight recipes out there that really don't take much work! I forgot how much I love my slow-cooker!", "I second this, I did this with my spending and when you put in into a pie chart it's kinda amazing just where your money goes in the end.", "Thanks good comment I agree to all", "your wife needs a job.  She is not doing anything for 8 hrs a day", "Or DiGiornio.  She'll just *think* it's delivery.", "I will sometimes order food for pick up and my boyfriend will get it on his way home.  A lot of restaurants I can pick a time for and order in advance. Would it be possible to do that sometimes so no one cooks but there's no delivery fees? Also look into more frozen meals. Easy snacks.  Etc.  Does your grocery store have an app or website where you can see what they have and make shopping lists? The one we use the most does and my boyfriend and I share the login on our devices so we can both see what's there and add to the list. If you can do the same, that might be helpful.  Batch cooking and extra meal prep on weekends might also help."]}
