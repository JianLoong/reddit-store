Easy snacks.  Etc.  Does your grocery store have an app or website where you can see what they have and make shopping lists?

Get her to guess the figures and I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be shocked, especially if you share what you could have done with the same amount of money eg a day out. \nWork together to develop a meal plan. Do some batch cooking together or find quick recipes. Also, have a picnic night. We do this regularly as it\u2019s easy, fun and cheap.

But we had a takeaway earlier this month, so we grabbed a homemade ready meal from the freezer - whenever we cook a ragu, chilli, curry etc, we make too much and freeze three or four portions, so we just have throw on some pasta or rice or whatever to cook and microwave the rest. Maybe that could be an option, or designate one weekend day/month for prepping freezer meals.

We also build in one \u201cflex\u201d meal so you can pick whatever works for each weekday.  We then make our grocery list based on that list.  We shop the list and prep what we can ahead of time.  Grilled meats, for instance.  When we grill, we freeze extra portions that can be quickly thawed out and added to casseroles, flatbreads, soups, whatever.

We have no kids and very little debt. We both work full-time and we're pretty busy people. I say all this to point out that we still don't order food delivery regularly because it's a wasteful thing to spend on. By that I mean that it's not usually worth it. If you want to eat out, it's a better experience to dine out. If you want to eat simpler, it's far better to cook. Not only for your health but also in terms of food quality. A lot of foods don't really travel that well and cooking is such an easy skill to pick up. It can also be really quick. I made dinner today in less than 20 minutes and that included the time it took to collect tomatoes and herbs from the garden, and chop everything. \n\nYou want your splurging to be intentional and thoughtful.

It doesn't sound like you resent your wife at all, just the food spending being too much. I encourage you to take the suggestion to sit down with a spreadsheet and figure out a budget and some savings goals. She needs to be on the team with you. You'll probably have to compromise with her, though.\n\nEven with the kids in school part time she has a lot on her plate if she's running a business and doing all the transportation and school stuff for the kids. That's not an excuse for overspending every month, but I am pretty tired myself a lot of days. So I get it. It's not laziness, it's irresponsibility. \n\nIt is not \"modern times\" to pay others to make and deliver food for you every day. It may take you both doing some food prep on weekends and investing in a slow cooker but home cooked meals are not a luxury IMO. You are stressing about this so it's important for her to address this concern. Good luck to you both!"]}
