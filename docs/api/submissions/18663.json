Last week, I had to return the rental car, and we're still waiting for the insurance check.

I've been trying to convince her to get another car or visit a dealership, but she keeps putting it off, dismissing it as \"Not now, stop bothering me with your crap.\" Currently, we're renovating our home, and she's occupied with planning furniture and appliances for the contractor. Consequently, I ended up paying $650 to my co-worker and renting his spare 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe. When I arrived at the garage with the rented SUV, she asked where I got it and why. I explained that I rented it from my co-worker because I need a car. I don't want to work a 12-hour shift and then endure a 4-hour commute. However, she insisted that the SUV is old and dangerous and that I should return it tomorrow.

Honestly she sounds pretty terrible.", "NTA Commuting that long is unreasonable, you tried to make a decision on the car together and she refused because she was busy. You handled it with a low investment and short term, solution which is pretty reasonable to me. Would have been TA if u had bought a car but not just renting a co-workers.", "NTA.

Normally, I would say that you should have made this decision *with* your wife, but it\u2019s ridiculous of her to expect you to commute 4 hours every day and to prioritize home renovations over a vehicle because it doesn\u2019t put *her* out much to go without one. \n\nSide note: do you two even *like* each other?", "NTA. She sounds like a real peach! Telling you not to bother her with your crap, then when you figure it out yourself she dumps all over your solution and expects you to spend 16 hours of your day working and commuting, so basically you would come home and go to bed at that rate lol that's absurd.", "She doesnt get to unilaterally decide that neither of you will have access to personal transportation.

Do you usually plan big purchases together and is it out of character for you to car shop solo? \n\nDid your wife offer an alternative to the rental from a coworker when she raised the safety concerns? Are those safety concerns legit? If the car is a death trap, then maybe she actually just had a \"oh no, baby I'm worried about you\" moment.

HOWEVER. I was a survivor of a truly nasty car wreck that should have left me and another member of my family absolutely dead. We were both very lucky. Depending on the accident you guys were involved in, you might want to check in with your wife and see if she's actually \"okay.\" I still deal with mental after effects of the wreck I was involved in years later.

Seems like a good deal to get you back and forth to work.  $650 isn't that much.  Maybe she's stressed about the cost of the home renovations but with a 12 hour shift and a five hour commute you might as well move into your work place.

So he rented a car from a co-worker", "Doesn't sound like she likes him and I'm not sure who on earth could possibly like her with that kind of attitude, not sure why you wouldn't just part ways, life's too short for that nonsense", "Sounds like OP attempted to involve the SO with finding a solution, but she refused:\n\n>dismissing it as \"Not now, stop bothering me with your crap.\"\n\nOP then had to make the decision unilaterally.", "Why? What reason do you have to believe that the OP is an unreliable narrator? \n\nJust your \"gut\" feeling?", "Really?  She is his partner, not his financial gatekeeper.

Get up leave house 1 hr. 2 hr commute. 12 hour work day. 2 hr commute home. 1 hour dinner and shower. That leaves 6 hours for sleep. The OP is NTA, but you are one however for even suggesting that.
