I live in a big 2 bedroom apartment with my cat and Reptiles, which he says he's been fine with. Yesterday he got upset that my cat is sleeping on my bed, she does this every night and sometimes also lays there during the day. He said that it's gross and a cat shouldn't be on my bed. She's an indoor cat and doesn't go outside so I don't want to restrict her living space any more then necessary (she's not allowed in the reptile room unless I'm also there), and also feel like it gives me more time with her because she comes to cuddle before i fall asleep and when i wake up. \n\nHe got upset over it and I jokingly said it's just a cat it's not like you'll wake up to my snakes or tarantula.

He also threw a tantrum over a very innocuous comment, which gives \"he's going to keep complaining and getting angry until she gives in\" vibes. That part is definitely not just a difference of opinion. It isn't normal whatsoever to get angry because your new girlfriend won't start scolding her cat for jumping on a bed.\n\nIf he doesn't like cats, he didn't have to date someone with cats. You cannot date someone with a pet and then demand and control how they interact with their pet, at least, not without being an AH."]}
