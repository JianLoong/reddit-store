If someone is in their seats then that person needs to move. Not you.\n\nThey obviously wanted the table seat. They should have booked sooner.", "Nta no one took their seats they wanted a free upgrade", "NTA\nIf they wanted to sit together, they should\u2019ve booked seats", "NTA\n\nIt doesn't actually matter because \"stink eye\" means absolutely nothing.", "NTA. They could have done as you did by kicking them out of your seats. And it is perfectly reasonable for wanting your children with you!", "Obviously NTA. You paid for those seats. If their own seats were occupied they should have gotten a steward, not take someone else\u2019s seat.", "NTA, especially because as far as I know the train from London to Paris is the Eurostar, and it only has assigned seats. Which means (if I got everything right), they were just trying to get better seats than what they booked, which is too bad because that\u2019s not your problem.", "Nope, NTA. They could have been lying or not, but taking some one else\u2019s seat is not right.", "LOL NTA just because they feel entitled doesn\u2019t mean you should feel bad about it", "NTA - you paid for assigned seats and they can F off out of them. Someone else taking their seats is their problem, and only their problem.", "Even if you didn't have children you would be NTA. It doesn't matter together they were there first, or people took their seats. If people took their seats they should get them back. Just like you did.\n\nIt was wrong of them to refuse to leave. Also, giving you the drink eye for wanting your booked seats?", "NTA. They could have gotten the conductor to get rid of the people taking your seats. Else, get assigned seating. Not your problem.", "NTA.\n\nYou bought assigned seats. They're yours. Period. Anyone else may politely fuck off with their excuses.", "NTA\n\nYou booked the seats, it's the Americans problem for no bothering to follow the system.", "NAH - there\u2019s not enough info to call anyone an AH here.
