Be benevolent if you want to, but don\u2019t be nice\u201d. So in this case you can interpret that to mean be respectful to others but also yourself. You can consider giving up your seat, but the moment that consideration crosses the line to potentially hurting your children etc then that is inappropriate.    Being \u201cnice\u201d generally means that you are bending over backwards usually in a way that doesn\u2019t respect your own needs too and it will always lead to trouble.
