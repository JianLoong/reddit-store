Be benevolent if you want to, but don\u2019t be nice\u201d. So in this case you can interpret that to mean be respectful to others but also yourself. You can consider giving up your seat, but the moment that consideration crosses the line to potentially hurting your children etc then that is inappropriate.    Being \u201cnice\u201d generally means that you are bending over backwards usually in a way that doesn\u2019t respect your own needs too and it will always lead to trouble.

When we made the people in our seats move, they then had to make the people in theirs move and the people in theirs finally realized they were on the wrong train!

People are weird on trains in particular, and often just assume seat assignments don\u2019t really matter.  I saw people from a variety of countries doing it last year in Italy, they just don\u2019t like confrontation.

One group sits in the wrong spot, the group whose seats they took don\u2019t tell them to move and sit somewhere else, which can continue a chain of multiple groups doing that. \n\nUntil one person just upfront says, no those are my seats, go get your own.
