I keep telling her that whether it is Christmas, birthdays, anything; they are days in the year. At the same time, I will buy her gifts when I can afford it, when I see something that I think she will enjoy; it is hers. \n\nOn Christmas (mind you I grew up with Judiasm), she bought me a present. The first thing I said was that I felt like an Asshole because I didn\u2019t buy her one. I did spend several thousand on the house in the weeks leading up to the holiday AND, I cooked us a great steak dinner. It wasn\u2019t good enough as she started another fight. \n\nThis morning, she sets a present on my desk, and I told her that again, I feel like an asshole because I did not reciprocate. I did do a ton of work on the house for her over the weekend, cooked for her and took her out for dinner on Sunday. Yes, it was WWIII this morning as I am trying to work. I have constantly begged her NOT to and that due to my beliefs, cannot. \n\nWe constantly fight but AITA as she knows how I feel, what my beliefs are yet continues to force hers on me?", "created_utc": 1676412394, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/112hkg5/aita_for_not_accepting_her_gift_today/", "score": 293, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If someone gives you a gift just graciously accept it, because it's the nice thing to do.   \n\nI'm an atheist, my wife's a Buddhist, and somehow we both made it through this morning without a fight.

You don't 'not believe' in gifts or feel disrespected from receiving them, you just don't care about them, and it's annoying to see you try to use language/an expression incorrectly to justify something trifle. Jehovah's Witnesses 'don't believe' in gifts because it is violation to part of their faith you just don't care about them. Big difference. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that you throw a bunch of unrelated things at her that you did when she just tries to present you with something thoughtful tells me you have other issues going on in terms of 'fairness' or whatever. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGiving gifts is not a belief. it's just a considerate way of expressing appreciation. You are not obligated to buy anything but if someone wants to buy you something, just say 'wow that's really nice of you, thanks'. If she is buying you something because she expects something back, that's a different issue entirely, but that's not what you're describing.", "ESH unless you can come to some sort of compromise, but it doesn't seem likely tbh. It's clear that holidays are meaningful to her, but they aren't to you. One of you either has to give up holidays or give in to holidays, and either way one of you will be unhappy as a result. I think you two just aren't compatible.", "You talk about her forcing her beliefs on you, but you're also forcing your beliefs on her.  \n\nI have to agree - it sounds like you two just aren't compatible.

I\u2019d say generally Not TA for  being on a different page regarding gifts. \n\nNot everyone is a great giver or enjoys holidays but it\u2019s important to align expectations or you will continue to have these blow ups. Seek out some couples counseling to help you resolve it or there will be a lot of holidays that are miserable for you both.\n\nETA: work around the house or basic support such as cooking does not equal a gift. Don\u2019t expect her to see those as anything other than standard household contributions and not all that special.", "Dump her. Y'all aren't compatible. Sorry to say it.", "She wants to be nice to you.", "YTA.\n\nYour stance on the holidays is understandable. At the same time, holidays are an important part of our culture. Many people have wonderful memories of holidays in the past, and those are traditions that they would like to continue into the future.\n\nGiving gifts is clearly important to her, and it sounds like getting gifts on christmas is important as well. Your preference to \"not buy into the comercialism\" is less important than her happiness.\n\nAdditonally, keep in mind that there may be a significant social cost when your partner does not get gifts from you. At work or with friends, it is likely that she is asked by people \"what did OP get you for valentines?\" \"what did they get you for christmas?\" In general, for most people in our culture, her saying something along the lines of \"I wanted something special but he didn't get me anything,\" is, at best, embarrassing and will make her feel less than other people and unloved.\n\nA good partner should take the following approach:\n\n\"I don't really care about the holidays, myself. But, they are important to my partner, and their happiness is more important to me than any particular stance on the holidays. I get her gifts on holidays because they make her happy, even though the holidays are not important to me. She also loves to give gifts on the holidays, and it is an important way for her to express her love for me, so I always accept them gracefully.\"\n\nThis is the bare minimum of putting your partner's happiness and joy first.\n\nMy advice to you is to talk to her about two things:\n\n1. what does she want in the way of gifts for holidays? Are expensive gifts important? Would a handwritten note be just as good? Or something else you make, presumably something more permanant than a steak dinner?\n2. tell her that you prefer small, functional gifts for holidays, along with a thoughtful note expressing how she feels about you. Tell her you don't mind a larger gift, but smaller ones, and especially inexpensive, functional, and heartfelt ones, are much more important than spending money on something extravagant.\n\nOverall, though it may be irrational, giving and receiving gifts is a significant part of the way our culture expresses love and affection towards those closest to us. It might not be logical, but it is nonetheless real. Compromise your take on \"commercialism\" to make the person you love happy, it's the bare minimum in our culture.", "YTA. Relationships are about compromise: Is your joyless rejection of all celebrations more important than her feelings? Cultures the world over know the need to celebrate together. Create your own traditions, and do nice things for your partner because you love her, and she seems to value these gestures.", "Info. \n\nExplain to me how money spent on the house and work done on the house is a gift for her and not care and upkeep of something you both live in.", "If:\n\nShe has expressed that the effort of choosing a gift for her is important to her and you are deciding that your non-commercial beliefs are more important then YTA.\n\nOtherwise, she should at this point know that you will not give gifts on a calendar basis, and she WBTA.\n\nMy admittedly unsolicited 2 cents is that it doesn\u2019t sound like you guys are on the same page about gift giving and maybe even other elements of the relationship. Not exactly your fault entirely, but you are the one with views outside the norm and should consider that in the future.", "So when do you celebrate? Ever?", "ESH because you both are seemingly incompatible and think you can change the other one.  Let this go.", "YTA. Why do you keep saying to her that you feel like an asshole/did not reciprocate, again and again for 2 years. If you sincerely felt like an asshole then quit being like that and give a meaningful gift here and there.", "YTA. When you make improvements to your shared house, those aren't gifts to your partner. Presumably you benefit from improvements to your own home.   \n\n\nYes, holidays are made up, but that doesn't change the fact that they provide opportunities for us to remind our loved ones how much they mean to us. If you value not giving gifts more than you value your partnership, don't change your behavior. If you want to have a healthy partnership, learn how to buy chocolate and a card for Valentine's Day.    \n\n\nAlso, I've heard people forgo holidays, but I've never heard of someone who also refuses to acknowledge a birthday - that's pretty cold.", "ESH- you because you have a person who wants to express love and get it in return and holds on to sentimental aspects of holidays.

She will be eternally frustrating and you will be eternally frustrated.", "I'm gonna say ESH.\n\nYou're both ignoring the other's wishes, to an extent that you need to have a real talk about if you're compatible with each other. Neither of your seems to willing to compromise on this issue, even though both of you are unhappy with the situation.", "ESH. You guys need to learn your love languages. You guys can seek and show love in different ways but you need to understand which are those ways for each other. \n\nFor her, giving and receiving gifts seems to be a love language that you doing chores around the house or cooking her dinner isn\u2019t satisfying. \n\nConversely, she needs to learn that doing chores and cooking for her is how you express your love. \n\nIn the end, you need to compromise and learn how each other wants to give and receive love in the way you two feel it the most", "YTA and a bit self righteous, but also you guys just don\u2019t sound compatible", "ESH. You can compromise and pick certain holidays. My spouse was a lot like you, but we've compromised. We do Christmas gifts, we don't celebrate Valentine's. We try to focus on not $$ things that the other wouldn't buy themselves. This year I bought him packing cubes and slipper socks and he got me a Google home for the bedroom so that I can listen to music and control our lights from bed.\n\n Our birthdays are in the same week so we often will choose a nice activity or weekend trip to celebrate rather than stuff. Occasionally we buy gifts for each other because it's something we think the other would like. But you live in modern society, pick 1-2 holidays and buy a damn gift.", "YTA, you don't have to support holidays monetarily but damn, love your woman or at least let her love you ... Why aren't you single?", "Maybe you aren\u2019t an AH but you\u2019re being dense: presents are about wanting to do something nice for others, it\u2019s not transactional. If your SO is getting you stuff be happy someone cares so much about you that they have to expedite even if you don\u2019t want it", "ESH. you seem to be rude and insecure, like it's not simply about beliefs. however, she has to accept that there are other love languages and you can like something else. but it sounds like you're simply incompatible", "So it looks like gift giving is her love language, and acts of service is yours. You both are going to be extremely unhappy until you understand how the other communicates and receives love and learn how to show love in that way.", "Hm.  I\u2019d say NAH but with a tilt of ESH. Your girlfriend shouldn\u2019t be gifting you thing if you dislike it then fighting with you.

Your girlfriend does. Not participating isn't fighting some religious battle or \"commercialism\" or whatever you think you're doing. You're just being Scrooge. Do you think when she sees her friends celebrating things with their significant others she just shrugs and thinks it's great she doesn't get to do those things with you, or do you think she feels like she's missing out?\n\nI remember when I was younger I also was of the \"who cares about birthday/holidays they're just days\" mentality.

I am not religious, i cannot buy  into the commercialism, and to me, they are just a day in the year. \n\nShe knows how I feel about the commercial aspect and yet continues to insist that I buy into it. I keep telling her that whether it is Christmas, birthdays, anything; they are days in the year. At the same time, I will buy her gifts when I can afford it, when I see something that I think she will enjoy; it is hers. \n\nOn Christmas (mind you I grew up with Judiasm), she bought me a present. The first thing I said was that I felt like an Asshole because I didn\u2019t buy her one. I did spend several thousand on the house in the weeks leading up to the holiday AND, I cooked us a great steak dinner. It wasn\u2019t good enough as she started another fight. \n\nThis morning, she sets a present on my desk, and I told her that again, I feel like an asshole because I did not reciprocate. I did do a ton of work on the house for her over the weekend, cooked for her and took her out for dinner on Sunday. Yes, it was WWIII this morning as I am trying to work. I have constantly begged her NOT to and that due to my beliefs, cannot. \n\nWe constantly fight but AITA as she knows how I feel, what my beliefs are yet continues to force hers on me?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Her reaction is also a bit wild considering you perform many acts of service, and do buy her gifts\u2026 just not necessarily for holidays. \n\nSomething\u2019s gotta give.

She likes showing her love through gifts.  You like showing your love through acts of service and time together - getting stuff done on the house, cooking a steak dinner, going out someplace together, etc.  Most people are wired to feel love reciprocated in the same manner that they are wired to give love.    \n\nThe problem isn't that you have different love languages.  The problem is how you both deal with this difference.  You ask her not to buy presents, she does anyway - because it is important to her and that's how she shows love.  When she buys you presents, instead of saying thank-you, you tell her that getting you a present makes you look like an asshole - you are basically tossing her love aside. You do things to show your love, but it's not what she was expecting - she tosses your love aside.  Then you fight because everybody is frustrated and no one actually feels that their love is reciprocated.    \n\nThe key is to recognize your different love languages, accept love from each other in the way it is given and make the effort to reciprocate in your partner's preferred language.

I am of Germanic descent and I know that the Germanic custom of gift giving goes back to Proto-Europe, but then again so do assholes.", "Awesome! I am just very stoned and I tried reading it like 15 times before I gave up lol", "Different love languages she likes gifts, he seems to like acts of service", "In the post he does say \"At the same time, I will buy her gifts when I can afford it, when I see something that I think she will enjoy; it is hers.\" I had assumed that means gifts as well as the examples of making the steak dinner and putting money into the house, though I could be interpreting it wrong.", "Exactly this. My husband lives by The Platinum Rule (I do too, just didn't have a phrase for it before he introduced me to it.) The Golden Rule says to treat others as you want to be treated. The Platinum Rule says to treat others as THEY want to be treated.", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nDudes probably still gonna get laid too. Fml", "No, he said he feels like an asshole for not giving one.   Nowhere in the OP does it say she expects one.", "So you're telling me not once in his entire lifetime has anyone ever even tried to give him a gift?  I don't believe that.   At some point in his life someone tried handing him a gift, and I doubt he turned it into an fight.", "Every adult knows their own birthday; it\u2019s literally your date of birth, which you are required to provide on official forms on a regular basis. I could believe he doesn\u2019t know his zodiac sign, maybe.", "Yeah and from what I understand, the women aren\u2019t supposed to be educated or pursue higher education but wtf do I know, that\u2019s where I met both her and her brother. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "But if he's not against buying her gifts and he knows it would mean something to her to have a gift on a special day, why not save the gift for then?", "That is me and my husband. It took me awhile to \u201cget it\u201d but now I recognize it as love.", "I can pay for services, but can't buy love.", "Yeah, it doesn\u2019t sound like she\u2019s mad about not getting something back.  It sounds like she\u2019s upset that he berates her for making him feel like an asshole.  Just accept the gift for goodness sake.  Don\u2019t complain when someone does something nice for you.", "A house is shelter. Shared living. It's messed up to consider it a gift. Making steak dinner? Again, basic chore. I've made more elaborate meals and did so without considering it a gift. It was because the recipe sounded good. Even suggesting his steak dinner as a gift suggests she's doing the cooking usually...without holding it as a \"gift\". Basic life skills used for daily living are not gifts.", "How is work on the house where he lives, suddenly a gift for her??\nIf he built her a craft room, why doesn't he say that? Now it sounds like \"aren't you grateful I cleaned the gutters\" or something.\n\nSame goes for the steak dinner imo: no mention if that's her favourite food. If it isn't, how does that even count as a present?", "It jumped out to me that he does the opposite: work on the house where you both live is not a gift.\nAnd a steak dinner? Is there a dish that's more of a guy obsession than steak?? And it's on a different day to boot!\n\nHe says \"if I see something she'll like, and if I have money, it's hers\" but he can't give a single example.\n\nThat's the anti-platinum rule imo.", "Only until one of her friends is like \"dude, why are you with somebody who cares so little about your feelings?\" or she finds this thread where strangers who see his side of the story are like \"wtf is wrong with you?\"\n\nHopefully.", "Ok then i don't see why she is starting fights", "You underestimate the cult like behaviors of the jehovas witness. There\u2019s is absolutely zero ways he could have gotten a gift as he would have been shunned by the community. he later was disfellowshipped because he got a divorce. He was a grown man by then and talks about it openly with everybody. It\u2019s actually one of the very first things I learned about him. So no, he has not been given a gift and everybody has always respected his wishes.", "Alternatively why does she keep giving gifts only on specified days instead of whenever after he has already demonstrated his dislike of the association aligned with those days? It goes both ways", "If he doesn\u2019t want the gift and he\u2019s let her know in advance, he doesn\u2019t have to accept it. Neither of them are wrong here", "To me, it sounds like he's starting them with the whole \"why are you trying to make me feel like an asshole\" thing.  Then she probably says \"I'm not, I'm just trying to do something nice\".  Then he says \"I've told you every time.... blah blah blah\" fight started.", "He's literally starting them with a nasty reaction to the gift by telling her she's making him into an asshole, when she was only giving a gift. Then he blames her for being upset by his behavior. Stop stretching to blame her for giving a gift. All women I know happily give gifts without expecting anything in return. And most men too, but not OP.", "That's how it reads to me, too."]}
