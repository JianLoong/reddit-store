At the time, my boyfriend did not have a driver's license or vehicle of his own. For a year, I pushed for him to get his license, offered to teach him in the little banger I had, even drove him to the dmv and bought the book for his G and M license. He neglected to even open them.\n\nAfter getting tired of paying for repairs on this car (a 2008 Yaris) I decided to go to a dealer and trade it for a newer car, a 2016 Juke. Again, I offered to teach him to drive and pushed him to take the test for his G1. After almost a year of owning the new car, he finally went and got the G1 and I started giving him driving lessons. But after a year, I got a job making far more money than I had been, and had also saved multiple years worth of tax returns to be able to put a down payment on the car of my dreams; a 2 door Wrangler for off roading.\n\nMy bf is atrocious with money, has been bankrupt in the past, over spent on money to the point of me needing to cover 100% of bills, often leaving me to make the choice between making a car payment or pay for groceries .... We had a plan to purchase him a car with a loan he was approved for, but in his time off, spent all $15000 dollars of it.\n\nFrustrated, I drove to a Jeep dealer and traded the Juke for a Wrangler, making myself the sole owner of the vehicle, not wanting to have his irresponsibility effect my credit any longer. He blew up, saying that the Juke was his and it was the car he was supposed to learn to drive in, and I was supposed to keep it and keep making payments on it so he could have a car too. Angry, I told him he wasn't allowed to drive the Wrangler, mostly because ***HE IS*** very neglectful on the road and I had upgraded to steel front and rear bumpers and didn't want him to kill someone. I made him borrow a friends Accent to learn and get his G2.\n\nI feel like the asshole for not including him on the purchase or allowing him to use it when we are in a relationship, but felt my financial responsibility deserved to be rewarded and protected.", "created_utc": 1671038705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlwt0u/aita_for_not_sharing_ownership_of_my_dream_car/", "score": 398, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This are not qualities of a good partner. \n\nYou can do so much better, OP!  \n\nAlso keep an eye on your keys I\u2019ve seen many stories on here where people have had their partners take their car.

However, you\u2019re being a big ol\u2019 AH to yourself by staying in this relationship.

Okay, glad that's dealt with.\n\nNTA", "Why are you even with him anymore", "OP..think about this and think REAL hard. Is this the man you want to have kids with? Knowing his irresponsibility with money. Seriously? $15k on his time off? I could live on that for 8 months. He seems very entitled to think YOUR Juke was HIS car.

So he then spent 15k of your money and you didn't put him on title on the new vehice\n\nthat was the first smart thing you've done since you met him.  When do you learn your lesson?  How much money does he have to burn fore you to recognise this relationship is him using you as a ATM\n\nYou need a life without this dead weight - NTA", "Get. Out. Now. He's irresponsible,  immature and incredibly entitled.

NTA, but seriously, RUN.", "why are you with him?", "NTA but hun you don\u2019t have a car ownership issue, you have a bf issue. The man sounds careless, irresponsible and I can\u2019t fathom as to how you will manage a future with a grown man with the immaturity of a 5 year old. You had to badger him to get a drivers license, badger him to learn to drive, and you said it yourself this man has gone bankrupt before. Are you really willing to risk your entire future on this. I get that money isn\u2019t everything, but these are basic life skills and he\u2019s barely trying. You can do better!", "NTA\n\nAre you his mom?  Are you planning on staying with this guy and keep on being his mother?  You should really reevaluate your relationship.", "NTA- Everything I just read screams this guy is what they used to call a Loser, and with the sounds of it he is walking around with a big L on his forehead. Ditch this guy and run.", "NTA\n\nWhy do you want to keep this person around?  What does he bring to your life?   Irresponsibility?  Bankruptcy?  Spending the grocery money on what, exactly?", "NTA  What are your thinking.  IT was not his car ever and you had the liability on whatever happened.  HE blew $15k?  WTH is that.  DUMP HIM NOW.", "NTA \n\nWhy are you staying with someone you seem to feel the need to essentially parent?", "He sounds like a loser who can\u2019t grow up to get his finances in order.

If you two ever got a joint account or shared property, it will be gone in a moment.", "Boyfriends aren't entitled to anything, per se. A husband is a different story.

Marriage (if that\u2019s on the table) will destroy you financially.\n\nYou sound like you\u2019re raising your boy when he should be wanting to do better for himself and you without you prodding him.

Also, honey...you deserve better.", "NTA  He must have some redeeming qualities that you haven't mentioned.  \n\nHe will drive you to financial ruin.  Find someone else who is as intelligent, resourceful, and financially competent as you.", "You're an autonomus person, not joined at the hip with him. I would dump the BF because he's irresponsible with money and couldn't be bothered to drive until you got a Jeep.

Your money, your decision etc. But don't ignore the fact that fights about money are one of the most common reasons for divorce. If you can't get on the same page about spending, being life partners is never going to go well.", "You need to dump this guy. You are NTA in this situation but you are being an AH to yourself by staying with dead weight.

He is awful and 100% will keep you from accomplishing your goals financially.", "Not sure why OP is continuing this relationship, all she is is his piggy bank. I hope the sex is good", "Y-T-A    to yourself for staying with this user/looser/abuser. \n\nNTA for the rest of it.   And don't entangle your finances with him any more", "Nta but why are u with him? \ud83d\ude36", "Do you have low self-esteem?

As a Wrangler owner, I know from firsthand experience how much they cost, and I have a 20 year old one. Do not let him near the car, do not let him near the keys, and if he does then dump him.

Your post made me see red.  Why on green earth are you questioning yourself here?  Your boyfriend is immature, irresponsible and frankly, an entitled mooch - it wasn\u2019t his car!  Why are you still in a relationship that is only dragging you down?  You can do better.  Please end this one-sided relationship.", "NTA. Dude brings nothing to the relationship. You can do better. Trade in the bf for a better model, too.", "You need to leave his ass. He\u2019s not gonna change. I speak from experience. My ex took my car like it was his. Made about 2000 euro fines and all without license which I didn\u2019t know. Mind you when I met him he was driving. We are now 10 years later. Did the same as you motivating bringing the books and everything. Girl run as hard as you can.", "NTA.\n\nAlso DTMFA.", "You were supposed to buy him a car? Are you his Sugar Mama?

All the best OP. Get out while you can.", "INFO: Can you actually explain where the 15,000 he took out as a loan went? Like... that isn't an accident where you double order something and accidentally run out of money. You need to try REALLY hard to make that much money disappear.\n\nAlso, he didn't get a car loan, he got a personal loan from a bank that he intended to use for a car?? None of this makes sense but the most baffling part is why you would spend a minute longer with this person?", "So... apart from headaches, what does this little boy contribute to the relationship?\n\nI mean, NTA for not sharing ownership of the vehicle with him, but why are you even with this dude?", "So he figured the Juke was his car \u2026 just because he wanted it?

OP, your BF is like a 2008 Yaris. He got the job done, but mostly, you\u2019re just dumping money in to keep him alive.
