At the time, my boyfriend did not have a driver's license or vehicle of his own. For a year, I pushed for him to get his license, offered to teach him in the little banger I had, even drove him to the dmv and bought the book for his G and M license. He neglected to even open them.\n\nAfter getting tired of paying for repairs on this car (a 2008 Yaris) I decided to go to a dealer and trade it for a newer car, a 2016 Juke. Again, I offered to teach him to drive and pushed him to take the test for his G1. After almost a year of owning the new car, he finally went and got the G1 and I started giving him driving lessons. But after a year, I got a job making far more money than I had been, and had also saved multiple years worth of tax returns to be able to put a down payment on the car of my dreams; a 2 door Wrangler for off roading.\n\nMy bf is atrocious with money, has been bankrupt in the past, over spent on money to the point of me needing to cover 100% of bills, often leaving me to make the choice between making a car payment or pay for groceries .... We had a plan to purchase him a car with a loan he was approved for, but in his time off, spent all $15000 dollars of it.\n\nFrustrated, I drove to a Jeep dealer and traded the Juke for a Wrangler, making myself the sole owner of the vehicle, not wanting to have his irresponsibility effect my credit any longer. He blew up, saying that the Juke was his and it was the car he was supposed to learn to drive in, and I was supposed to keep it and keep making payments on it so he could have a car too. Angry, I told him he wasn't allowed to drive the Wrangler, mostly because ***HE IS*** very neglectful on the road and I had upgraded to steel front and rear bumpers and didn't want him to kill someone. I made him borrow a friends Accent to learn and get his G2.\n\nI feel like the asshole for not including him on the purchase or allowing him to use it when we are in a relationship, but felt my financial responsibility deserved to be rewarded and protected.", "created_utc": 1671038705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zlwt0u/aita_for_not_sharing_ownership_of_my_dream_car/", "score": 4575, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I was told i deserved it and i believed it. I was in denial and beaten down emotionally in those relationships. When I left, it was scary, but eventually it felt like a weight was lifted. And I kept getting into these toxic relationships because it was all I knew. I'm single now. But this issue is more than about your dream car. I'm guessing there are deeper issues here than is mentioned. And the partner you choose will directly impact your life in every way (where you live, how you live, kids, jobs, finances, family/friends dynamics) for the rest of your life, so it's important to know what you want and what you can compromise on.
