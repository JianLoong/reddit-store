That night, Ken called Trina to ask for a favour. Ken\u2019s best friend Ted was in our city for the day on business but his flight home had been canceled and he couldn\u2019t get a hotel room so Ken asked if Ted could spend the night at Trina\u2019s. Trina said sure and told Ken to give Ted her number and invite him to come join us for dinner.  \n\nTed arrived about 15 mins later. It was crystal clear from the moment Ted walked in that he was looking for a hook up. And, within about 10 mins, he zeroed in on Katie and the two of them pulled their chairs back from the table and huddled together whispering to one another. \n\nTrina, our other friend and I were exchanging looks about this because it was like we had crashed their date. After dinner, Trina asked me and our other friend to come back to her place because she didn\u2019t want to be stuck alone with Ted and Katie. \n\nI stayed at Trina\u2019s until around midnight while Ted and Katie became more acquainted and Trina tried in vain to make the situation less bizarre/awkward. Ted and Katie continued to act like we were invisible but Ted left his phone on the table and someone named Hope kept calling. I interrupted Ted and Katie to give him his phone and ask who Hope was but he just took it, turned it off and ignored me. \n\nAround midnight, Ted and Katie decided to go to a bar together, they found one nearby they liked the sound off and left together.  \n\nTrina told me the next day: \n\n* Ted and Katie slept in the same bed and that she had heard them having sex. \n* She found Ted on social media and that Hope is his wife and that they have young children together. \n\nWe were both disgusted by this and Trina was upset about what Ken would say. I told Trina that she had nothing to be embarrassed about and that she needed to tell Ken because either he had no idea that Ted was looking to have an affair and should know so he could talk some sense into him. Or, Ken knew this about Ted and still put Trina in this situation. \n\nI thought that was the end of the story until months later Trina was visiting Ken and Abby and Ted and Hope came to hang out with them. \n\nTrina learned: \n\n* Ken never told Abby about Ted\u2019s cheating and that Hope didn\u2019t know either. Partly because Ken didn\u2019t want to loose their relationship as a foursome. \n* Ted and Katie\u2019s affair has continued all this time and they have met up in various cities.\n\nTrina won't tell Hope because she only met her once/she doesn\u2019t want Ken and Abby to be mad at her. Ted thinks it\u2019s funny that Hope doesn\u2019t know. Ken won\u2019t tell Hope because it\u2019s inconvenient for him.\n\nI don\u2019t know Hope.

I just think with the number of people that already know it is just going to fall apart.", "If you have the time and effort to expend energy for this and are prepared to never regret the consequences of your choice and take responsibility, then by all means let her know. Otherwise, let karma do its work. I know that staying silent when a wrong is committed is also wrong but to each their own, I guess. Everyone hates more responsibilities, and that's why most of them advocate staying out of it in fact I do recommend that too. At the end of the day, your decision alone matters, so decide wisely and do not let our judgments influence you.", "I\u2019m not sure how snitching on people you don\u2019t really know is having nice things", "I loathe cheaters. But I also mind my own business.", "The only person who\u2019s gonna ruin the kids lives is their father not hope or OP. Hope DESERVES to know.", ">It may embarrass her less that way\n\nThat's a fair point. \n\nHope wouldn't know my name anyway. At least I don't think so? But if I were to reach out, I'd include specifics that would reference Ken and Trina and even if I didn't, I'm sure it would get back to Trina that an anonymous person told Hope about the affair and Trina would be furious. I'd rather avoid the drama of that. But I'm not bothered if Trina decides she hates me for speaking up. I am semi concerned what she may do as a result.", "That is absolutely disgusting, I am so sorry your \"friend\" has put you in this position. None of them are people I would want in my life if I were you, if this is how they treat people they supposedly like and care about. \n\nIt is even more horrific that they are actively mocking this poor woman behind her back.", "Ok now I\u2019m annoyed AF by these AHs. You should know I hate snitchin, but please do.", ">I think it says a lot about Ken's character though that he's just keeping that information to himself just cause he doesn't want to lose the current couple dynamic\n\nAgreed 100%\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI thought about the whole issue of what if Hope doesn't believe me. But I figure if I were to say anything to her I would be specific about the details, ex: name the cities that I know Ted and Katie have met up in and when. From there, she can either believe me or not.", "This the plot of most of the wattpad books out there lol", "Guess I'll just go rob you and a whole bunch of other people. And that's cool, as long as you don't know I've robbed you, as per your logic.", "\"Nice things\" includes a peaceful and respectful society. \n\nIf we as a community accept behaviours that are to the long-term detriment of the community, we are promoting the diminishing of the community. Nothing good will come of it for OP or the folk directly involved. Or all of the people they affect with their actions. \n\nOP loses nothing more than they've already lost by informing Hope, and stands to gain by increasing the integrity of the folk around them - their community.", "You loathe cheaters, but value minding your own business so much that you're happy to sit by and do nothing, knowing someone is being actively cheated on.\n\nNice.", "Oh Ted/Ken/Katie are definitely NOT my friends. \n\nTrina and I were close friends but I've taken a step back from her for a bunch of reasons--this being a big one of them", "Yeah my concern is that it could backfire on you, as it\u2019s mostly hear-say from your standpoint, and it puts Trina in an awkward spot.", "i would s\u272ey to tell her but it's like why would you i wanna see how this plays out \u204e \u204e \u204e does that make ME the asshole\ufe56", "Spoken like a person who has never tried to tell someone they were being cheated on before. Turned into a huge issue. That\u2019s why you don\u2019t look for trouble.", "Some of the details are. But I witnessed a lot of it first hand. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally, I think Trina should have spoke up and told Hope herself as soon as she found out that Ken didn't. In my book, Trina put herself in an awkward spot and is being a coward.", "We are all AH here lol passing judgments.", "Uhh... the cheater is the one looking for trouble. \n\nI've been the one told my partner is cheating, but thanks for the condescension. I cancelled my lease and moved in a matter of days (no kids or pets to consider) and forced him out of the place. \n\nAnd I confronted the two girls and one guy who covered for him during the months he was screwing my best friend. \n\nIt was messy, of course. But the mess wasn't mine, nor was it the responsibility of the friend who told me. We remained friends. \n\nI'd much rather have a friend with integrity.", "I already ruled NTA, but this is all *so messy*.   \n\nI think the choice is probably out them and maybe get the ick from Trina, or watch this whole thing implode on its own and take the sweet, sweet, schadenfreude", "She\u2019s not really either of these two ppls friend. I\u2019ve told someone and they hated me for it. Anyways argue with someone else", "Sounds like it\u2019s a good thing she isn\u2019t that close with hope then. If she hates her then there\u2019s no real change in her life", "You commented on my comment, arguing with me; but spot on, we're done."]}
