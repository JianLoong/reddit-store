That night, Ken called Trina to ask for a favour. Ken\u2019s best friend Ted was in our city for the day on business but his flight home had been canceled and he couldn\u2019t get a hotel room so Ken asked if Ted could spend the night at Trina\u2019s. Trina said sure and told Ken to give Ted her number and invite him to come join us for dinner.  \n\nTed arrived about 15 mins later. It was crystal clear from the moment Ted walked in that he was looking for a hook up. And, within about 10 mins, he zeroed in on Katie and the two of them pulled their chairs back from the table and huddled together whispering to one another. \n\nTrina, our other friend and I were exchanging looks about this because it was like we had crashed their date. After dinner, Trina asked me and our other friend to come back to her place because she didn\u2019t want to be stuck alone with Ted and Katie. \n\nI stayed at Trina\u2019s until around midnight while Ted and Katie became more acquainted and Trina tried in vain to make the situation less bizarre/awkward. Ted and Katie continued to act like we were invisible but Ted left his phone on the table and someone named Hope kept calling. I interrupted Ted and Katie to give him his phone and ask who Hope was but he just took it, turned it off and ignored me. \n\nAround midnight, Ted and Katie decided to go to a bar together, they found one nearby they liked the sound off and left together.  \n\nTrina told me the next day: \n\n* Ted and Katie slept in the same bed and that she had heard them having sex. \n* She found Ted on social media and that Hope is his wife and that they have young children together. \n\nWe were both disgusted by this and Trina was upset about what Ken would say. I told Trina that she had nothing to be embarrassed about and that she needed to tell Ken because either he had no idea that Ted was looking to have an affair and should know so he could talk some sense into him. Or, Ken knew this about Ted and still put Trina in this situation. \n\nI thought that was the end of the story until months later Trina was visiting Ken and Abby and Ted and Hope came to hang out with them. \n\nTrina learned: \n\n* Ken never told Abby about Ted\u2019s cheating and that Hope didn\u2019t know either. Partly because Ken didn\u2019t want to loose their relationship as a foursome. \n* Ted and Katie\u2019s affair has continued all this time and they have met up in various cities.\n\nTrina won't tell Hope because she only met her once/she doesn\u2019t want Ken and Abby to be mad at her. Ted thinks it\u2019s funny that Hope doesn\u2019t know. Ken won\u2019t tell Hope because it\u2019s inconvenient for him.\n\nI don\u2019t know Hope.
