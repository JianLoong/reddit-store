Before my daughter was born, my husband and I mostly lived off of convenience food and take out- when she started eating solids was when I started making an effort to cook, which I did for years.\n\nEarly on during the pandemic I was really struggling to feed myself,  I would come home from work and make dinner but by the time it was done I would be so exhausted that even trying to eat what I just made made me feel nauseated, so I wouldn't eat for days at a time. I lost a lot of weight because I unintentionally starved myself for abut 2-3 months before I actually registered that there might be a problem.\n\nAbout 6 months ago I decided that I didn't want to be responsible for cooking dinner for the family anymore. I realized that the whole process, from planning out the menu to prepping and cooking is very stressful and overwhelming for me. My husband also has a somewhat strict diet due to his athletic hobbies- he's often either bulking or cutting weight, so always having to keep track of his current diet was just another source of stress and anxiety for me.\n\nI still make my daughter lunch every day for school, make him breakfast every night and do most of the grocery shopping. The only part I asked him to participate in was the menu and the cooking- I even do the dishes. Also, even if I don't \"cook\", I do make sure my daughter eats and I remind myself to eat (most days)- even if it's hot dogs or chicken nuggets.\n\nCue last week, when he came home late from a training session and looked in the fridge to find that I had not made any dinner, despite the fridge being full of ingredients. He got mad  and said he couldn't believe I can't take the time to cook a single chicken breast so he has something to eat when he gets home. That's when I reminded him that I had made it very clear that dinners were not going to be my responsibility and why. He called me an asshole and said that I was being inconsiderate of his health, that he needs to be able to eat nutritionally good food and not just take out that he gets while he's out. \n\nI suppose I did see the packet of chicken sitting there and maybe it wouldn't have taken too much for me to pop it in the airfryer with some BBQ sauce or something, but I feel like he's manipulating me and trying to force me into cooking again by default.\n\nI don't feel particularly bad about not cooking because I told him months ago that I don't want to be responsible for dinner, and that he would be better suited for it since he likes cooking more than I do and is more willing to try new things than I ever was. \n\nSo, Reddit AITA for not making sure he has something to eat when he gets home?", "created_utc": 1667162045, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhp4j3/aita_for_not_making_dinner_for_my_husband/", "score": 7, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He\u2019s a grown man and is capable of feeding himself.  If he wants food available after his training sessions, he can figure out how to make that happen.  Even if you just did not want to cook only because you don\u2019t enjoy it, you still be NTA.  However because the stress of cooking impacts both your mental and physical health, you are absolutely not an AH for stopping.  Your husband is both the AH and an entitled brat who needs to learn how to feed himself.", "You\u2019re NTA\n\nHowever, I think you need to properly sit down with your husband and talk about this. You have an ED and it seems like he doesn\u2019t really grasp that. \n\nAlso if you haven\u2019t sought help yet OP please do, it\u2019s really really important you\u2019re not on your own with this.", "NTA. He\u2019s being inconsiderate of your health by not seriously addressing your eating disorder and instead throwing a tantrum because you didn\u2019t make him some chicken, despite him already knowing you aren\u2019t doing that anymore.\n\nYou have an unhealthy relationship with food though that should be addressed. Also, an abusive husband by the sounds of things. Calling you an \u201casshole\u201d over a piece of uncooked chicken is not on.", "NTA are his arms broken? You are a wife, not his maid.", "NTA. It wouldn't have taken too much for him to cook the chicken, when he got home.\n\nYour responsibility is to feed your daughter (which you do), not your husband.", "NTA\nHe's got time for his hobby, he's got time to feed himself.", "NTA because your husband seems to be solely focused on his own health and not aware or concerned about what is going on with you.  Who cooks dinner for your husband is not the primary concern here. \n\nIt\u2019s very concerning that neither one of you noticed that you weren\u2019t eating for 3 months.  If you haven\u2019t been working with medical professionals to help with your ED, I think it\u2019s essential you pursue some help asap.", "NTA.", "I just want to address some things without replying to too many comments: \n\nI have spoken to my husband about how food stresses me out and he knows that my relationship with food is not healthy. I'd spoken with him about it a lot, even before I decided not to do it anymore, because it was a constant source of stress. \n\nThis also isn't the first time he gets mad that there's no food for him when he gets home after the discussion where I told him I needed him to take that task from me. It's just the most... Confrontational, I guess. \n \nWhat made me decide to ask him to take on the responsibility is that he did, for about a week or two, make several nice meals and he was really enjoying it. So, he is capable of cooking and I know he does enjoy it. That's partially why I didn't feel too bad about asking him to take it away from me. He's just never before had to be responsible for there being food at home, it was always kind of a novelty for him and I had the responsibility. \n\nDuring the time when I wasn't eating, he was doing a lot of hours at work and coming home late because it was early in the pandemic and his company was short staffed, so I don't know if he noticed that I wasn't eating. Even I didn't realize how long it had been going on until I saw a picture of myself and it worried me. Really though, I've always been skipping meals, not out of any particular reason, I genuinely just forget to eat a lot. It hadn't ever gotten that bad before though. \n\nI have been thinking I need to see a therapist or a dietician, and these comments are really convincing me to do so. Sometimes I think \"it's not that bad\" until someone tells me otherwise, so I appreciate the perspective. \n\nThank you all for the support.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He should be cooking to be considerate of YOUR health.\n\nWhy was cooking made your responsibility in the first place? Has he ever cooked?", "You are two grown-ups who need to do a lot better for your child. Get therapy. Have family meals. Do better.

No judgement.", "NTA\n\nYou both need to sit down and work out who does what.\n\nHe also needs to be MUCH more empathetic and understanding about your struggles with food. It\u2019s ironic that he said YOU were being inconsiderate of HIS health.\n\nHad he even asked you to cook that night? Or just assumed you should see the chicken in the fridge and cook for him?", "Question: During the 2-3months that you starved yourself, where was your husband?", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s an asshole. \n\nI work out and go to the gym, my husband and I prepare different meals. Except on the weekends. \n\nNo one is responsible for my meals but me. When I get back from work, if I\u2019m THAT lazy, I prepare something to pop in the oven so it\u2019s done when I get back. Because no one else is going to do it for me and I would not expect them to. \n\nI meal prep my protein to be refrigerated / frozen or ready to be cooked out the freezer because of my schedule. And then add my veg + carbs. It\u2019s not that hard. Plus, my dogs eat raw so I usually plan out / prepare their meals at the same time. \n\nIf I can sort myself and the dogs out, he can sort himself out.", "TA, maybe not. Inconsiderate more than likely. It sounds like your husband is fine cooking but that one time he comes home late, tired and then have to scrounge up something to cook is a little inconsiderate. You are correct, you could have popped something in the air fryer and let it be without having to see it. You 2 are married. That's your prime helpmate and you are his. It's not you do you, and I do me. That's not how marriages tend to work. \n\nJust think of how you would feel if you came home late, tired and whatever choosing whether it's laundry or food doesn't matter and he did that to you. How would that make you feel? Would you be we straight or would you be like what a you know what?", "INFO: do you work outside the home or are you home all day?", "It kind of just fell on me by default, I always get home earlier than him and was always responsible for feeding our daughter, first with breastfeeding and then because I realized she needed to eat food at a certain point so I just took it on. \n\nHe cooks sometimes, but maybe once every few months before I decided I would stop. Now he does it very sporadically, once or twice a week if at all.", "I think he just assumes that I'll do it because I always have, until a few months ago.", "I mean, that has been my reality for most of our marriage, tbh.", "I work full time outside the home, but he does work more hours, usually.", "Is he fully aware of how much preparing food bothers you? In your post you mentioned telling him you wanted to step back but does he know why?\n\nIf he does and he's not stepping up, he's a major asshole and he needs a reality check about what it means to support his partner.\n\nIf he doesn't, you need to let him know asap. Problems with food don't just disappear and he needs to know so he can support you.", "Then he is equally responsible for meals, including planning and cooking. What is this weird expectation of his that you have to feed him?\n\nNTA"]}
