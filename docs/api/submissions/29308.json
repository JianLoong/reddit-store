My bathroom is in my bedroom behind 2 doors. \n\nA couple weeks ago i got a menstrual cup sterilizer because i wasn't a big fan of making menstrual cup tea in my designated menstrual cup pot on the middle of the night dreading one of them finding it. I know a period is a normal thing and im not emberassed about it or the fact i use a menstrual cup, i just don't want anyone seeing something i put in my vagina. \n\nWell i finally ordered a mestrual cup sterilizer and it works by steam sterilizing the cup in the place of boiling. Me and the two guys i live with are all friends and have been for nearly six years. John was in the living room when i came home with the package and just casually asked what I ordered and because I didn't think anything of it I was honest and told him it was a menstrual cup sterilizer. He said he's always wondered how people clean those and I explained that most people after they dump it out either rinse it or wash it with soap and water and then they boil it. He looked horrified and I explain that I have my own pot I use specifically for that and that I actually keep it in my bathroom cause tbh Id be grossed out too if I thought they were boiling their mestrual cups in our communal pots (ya know, if they had them). He looked satisfied and asked how the new one works and I explained that it was steam and said I could show him it if he was really that curious. I was going to run it a couple times empty anyways. Well. Once he saw the little volcano of steam coming out of it he looked disgusted and said \"I dont want to breathe your period air.\" I laughed cause i thought he was joking but he was being dead serious. When i told him i would run it in my bathroom with the doors shut he doubled down and started talking about vents and how he doesnt want to inhale my \"blood fog\". I unplugged it and took it to my bathroom and it hasn't been brought up since. \n\nDavid thinks John is being an ass and over reacted, and says I should just use it without telling him because logically it wont be any more steam than when I would boil it in the kitchen. I feel conflicted. If he's really that uncomfortable with it I would feel bad, but I also dont want to talk about it again with him to explain it isnt a \"blood fog\".
