My bathroom is in my bedroom behind 2 doors. \n\nA couple weeks ago i got a menstrual cup sterilizer because i wasn't a big fan of making menstrual cup tea in my designated menstrual cup pot on the middle of the night dreading one of them finding it. I know a period is a normal thing and im not emberassed about it or the fact i use a menstrual cup, i just don't want anyone seeing something i put in my vagina. \n\nWell i finally ordered a mestrual cup sterilizer and it works by steam sterilizing the cup in the place of boiling. Me and the two guys i live with are all friends and have been for nearly six years. John was in the living room when i came home with the package and just casually asked what I ordered and because I didn't think anything of it I was honest and told him it was a menstrual cup sterilizer. He said he's always wondered how people clean those and I explained that most people after they dump it out either rinse it or wash it with soap and water and then they boil it. He looked horrified and I explain that I have my own pot I use specifically for that and that I actually keep it in my bathroom cause tbh Id be grossed out too if I thought they were boiling their mestrual cups in our communal pots (ya know, if they had them). He looked satisfied and asked how the new one works and I explained that it was steam and said I could show him it if he was really that curious. I was going to run it a couple times empty anyways. Well. Once he saw the little volcano of steam coming out of it he looked disgusted and said \"I dont want to breathe your period air.\" I laughed cause i thought he was joking but he was being dead serious. When i told him i would run it in my bathroom with the doors shut he doubled down and started talking about vents and how he doesnt want to inhale my \"blood fog\". I unplugged it and took it to my bathroom and it hasn't been brought up since. \n\nDavid thinks John is being an ass and over reacted, and says I should just use it without telling him because logically it wont be any more steam than when I would boil it in the kitchen. I feel conflicted. If he's really that uncomfortable with it I would feel bad, but I also dont want to talk about it again with him to explain it isnt a \"blood fog\". John has made it clear im the asshole if I turn the apartment into a divs cup sauna.

Guys are AH for making us ashamed of something we have to deal with every month . They freak out when they see a hint of a pad in the bathroom trash . Do we complain that their \"socks \" get into the washing machine and we don't want all their sperm on our clothes ? He is breathing exhaust gases from cars which are harmful so he can survive 0.000000001 of blood in the air lol", "NTA\n\nYou're doing everything you can to accommodate John's wishes and already doing it in the bathroom beyond reasonable.

His mom has it, his grandmother did too, if he has a sister then so does the sister. It's incredibly normal. It's not like you were or are going to do it in common areas or in front of him. Plus, he was the one who was so interested and wanted to see how it works. He could've just left it at that but had to make comments and make you feel bad over something that is normal and not your fault. David is right, he is overreacting. Use the sterilizer. John can't do anything about it. Not to mention the fact that there is no way for him to even know whether you use it or not unless he goes to your bathroom or something.", "NTA, they should learn how steam and evaporation actually work. Maybe email them a Wikipedia page or perhaps \"the water cycle for dummies\" chart, if there is one.

Make that blood sauna, sis!", "NTA, I had a very loud giggle at the words \"period air\" and \"blood fog\" but then the sad reality hits me that some men are still stuck in the dark ages with this \"woman, period, unclean!\" BS.", "NTA. You literally clean it before you use the steriliser. It's already clean, you're just making it *more* clean, and safer to use internally. Dust is grosser than the steam that comes out of those things.", "Wtf is this guy on? NTA", "NTA \nHes just gonna have to suck it up and grow up.
