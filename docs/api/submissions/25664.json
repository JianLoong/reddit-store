She\u2019s just butthurt because even though her room is bigger, yours is nicer.

I'm not saying OP shouldn't voice the gripe, but this situation needs an adult and OP can choose to be the grown-up because the parents seem to have abdicated the role.\n\nI don't know on what basis the rooms were assigned, but I suspect that the AHs are the parents. If they had done this by a coin toss, it would have put pay to the \"I'm the favourite\" taunt.", "No, nobody has to be a peacemaker.

I gather you wouldn't mind living in a house full of tension so you can \"keep your boundaries\", but I bet if somebody doesn't demonstrate some maturity here, that house could degrade to a living hell.\n\nTo both step mom and sister she can say, \"Look, I didn't appreciate the gloating. It was extremely childish on your part. But we have a choice: we can get on and act like one family, or live in tension. I choose the former, but I can't make that happen alone. I'm willing to put it behind us *this time*. If you continue to act like a 5 year old, this relationship is going to suck for everyone. What do you want to do?\"", "NTA, but if you want to be petty while also seemingly keeping the peace, help your sister, but do such a bad job that she prefers you don\u2019t help.

Her mocking no longer works because she realizes that your room is now nicer than hers.\n\nIf you were to now use your new position of room-superiority to mock *her,* that would be wrong. This is a chance to be the bigger, more mature person & keep doing what you're doing & just be \"too busy\" to help her. You could suggest that she check Pinterest for decorating ideas & let her do her thing. You are not obligated in *any* way to be her interior decorator!\n\nWhat's nice for you & sad for her is that your room reminds you of love as shown by your bf & his dad. Her room may also end up looking like a Pinterest pin, but it will never have that \"secret ingredient\" of love! Whatever she does with her room will be based on jealousy & selfishness, as already demonstrated by her gloating over \"being the favorite.\" Not that you should *ever* point that out to her - it'll be our little secret. :) Just enjoy your room & be thankful that you were able to turn a negative (smaller room, mean stepsis) into a huge positive (cozy room, love from others) & keep that kind of positivity & \"can do\" attitude as you grow up & move on to other situations!\n\nP.S.

Hopefully she\u2019ll learn something from this and will start to approach people with a more generous attitude.
