I did get mad and told her why would she go and when confronted by her aunt I said I was okay with her going but and didn\u2019t understand why she had to leave now. And told her  I\u2019d have to keep my daughter the month and she refuses because her parents have a right to see our daughter too I think if it was so important she wouldn\u2019t be taking this vacation due to our break up. : I start working next week and she left my daughter with me rn and informed me her flight is leaving in an hour and to send her pics.\nEdit: I worked my own personal issues and put my emotions aside.of-course I will alternate with my ex in-laws I should not be mean and refuse to let them see there granddaughter. 19f18M", "created_utc": 1704588176, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/190f476/aita_for_being_upset_that_my_exgf_left_to/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Especially with the wish-washy end date.  You suck because you don\u2018t want the child to spend any of that time with her grandparents, but she is also a burden because you are starting work. Which is it?\n\n  \nThe two of you need a legal binding custody agreement.  In writing. Preferably overseen by actual lawyers.  Get on it.", "ESH. She's your daughter, you need to figure out how to take care of her. It's nice that your ex's family is willing to help. You'll need to be cooperative to work out a child care schedule.\n\nEDIT: you don't say why you don't want that family's help, but you have to do something while you're at work.", "You may be a bit salty that she\u2019s going on vacation. But that\u2019s neither here nor their, it is what it is. \n\nBut alternating days with the grandparents will be a nightmare. \n\nJust do what lots of other people do, drop her off in the morning, go to work and then pick her up after work. And it goes without saying that you keep her for the weekend. \n\nThe grands are babysitting so they\u2019ll have time with her, and you know they\u2019ll treat her well, and then you take over the parenting.", "Info: I'm confused.

That doesn't mean she gets to just take a vacation from her life and responsibilities, especially in such a wishy washy way with no official return date. She's TA here.\n\nI'm glad you're going to let your daughter see her grandparents -- it sounds like that will be a big help for you navigating this time with solo responsibility.\n\nAnd as others have said, you need a legal custody agreement immediately. It will be a huge help to have the protection of having everything in writing.\n\nGood luck with the new job! And I hope your daughter feels better really soon.", "So, you're annoyed you have to take care of your own child.", "NTA\n\n  \nDocument, talk to a lawyer, and go to court for full custody - and sue her for child support.", "You're 18 & already have a kid!

You sound like you are being completely reasonable with what you were left with. If she wanted to ride out, of course, that's her decision. On the same note, you don't get to disappear and demand things at the same time. \n\nSo you make the obvious assumption that your daughter will be staying with you while she's gone, but that's not ok. Her parents \"have the right\" to have her as well. \nNot to sound cruel, but grandparents have zero rights to their grandchildren. If you want them in their lives, that is up to you. Obviously, you sound like you do want that for her, and that is wonderful. But does that give her the right to DEMAND it? Absolutely not. \nGoing back to the beginning, she wants a break from her BABY girl. Her SICK baby girl.

In the moment (not now) I was finding it hard to understand why she would just up and leave with like 1 day notice even tho she said she wouldn\u2019t leave yk and my daughters sick too so like why would u leave why not postpone I have no issue with her vactioning I told her that but it is what it is", "How did you come to that conclusion?

If you have no real issues with them, co-operation is the best path for now.  \n\n\nBut seriously - legal custody agreement. If everyone knows expectations/obligations, it should not only protect your rights, but also prevent her from dipping out on you again. And if she does, you have a legal mechanism to fall back on.  In the meantime, you are the reasonable, co-operative co-parent, and hopefully that precedent will help you.   \n\n\nBest of luck to you!", ".....,,..?...", "Please use punctuation bc it takes too long to read your words or follow your thought process.
