He could have told you 'it's something between me and your mom, so please dont say anything to her and let me handle everything' if the was so worried...\nAnd since it's your mom, you had every right to talk to her about something involving your life and future.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but his reaction seems too extreme...are you sure that he really wants to marry you? Or that your mother response made him change his mind and used what you told him as an excuse to break things with you?\nBecause if he really loves you, he need to apologies for the way he treated you. But you also need to talk about it, because I would be worried about tie my life with someone that has this reactions when things doesnt go his way....", "He overreacts...", "NTA, if he didn\u2019t want you asking her about it he shouldn\u2019t tell you in the first place, or specify he didn\u2019t want you to ask her about it. I would think the same thing as you in this situation.", "NTA. Holy crap that\u2019s a ridiculous overreaction. Does he often overreact like this? Jeez.", "NTA. He is still way too immature for marriage.", "NTA, and bf's reaction is way off the rails. Talk to him about the issue right now. Meanwhile, while it is a sweet gesture to ask a parent permission to marry their daughter, it's completely unnecessary nowadays. If you and bf want to get married, you just get engaged and plan your wedding. Once you're an adult, even if the parent says no you can still get married; it's not like the legal ability of two adults to get married hinges on getting \"permission.\" The only people who need permission to legally marry in most countries are minors.", "NTA. It's probably best to call the wedding and entire relationship off now before your boyfriend gets even crazier.", "NTA. What did he expect you to do? He could easily have anticipated that you would ask your mother for the reasons.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 NTA", "I think this is a bit ESH. \n\nConfronting your mom about something your partner reported back to you is something the two of you should be on the same page with. It was his interaction and you talking to your mom has the potential to alter how she sees your partner. \n\n*But*, his behaviour in the aftermath is bizarre and not proportionate to what you did. I would really have a think about that.", "Slight YTA.\n\nSure your bf response is also a bit in asshole territory, but the act of contacting your mother about something he told you, doing all this by telephone (to your mom, to him) instead of in conversations is weird to me. \n\nYou could've told him you were going to talk about it. Telling your partner something doesn't equal someone needing to react and act without discussing that. He felt the need to ask her premission, and basically you disregarded his sole part in that and 'helped' him with it. \n\n And if you do like talking with your mom like that, without communicating this to him, maybe it's something she should pick up with your bf, instead of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
