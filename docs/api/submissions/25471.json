He could have told you 'it's something between me and your mom, so please dont say anything to her and let me handle everything' if the was so worried...\nAnd since it's your mom, you had every right to talk to her about something involving your life and future.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong, but his reaction seems too extreme...are you sure that he really wants to marry you? Or that your mother response made him change his mind and used what you told him as an excuse to break things with you?\nBecause if he really loves you, he need to apologies for the way he treated you. But you also need to talk about it, because I would be worried about tie my life with someone that has this reactions when things doesnt go his way....", "He overreacts...", "NTA, if he didn\u2019t want you asking her about it he shouldn\u2019t tell you in the first place, or specify he didn\u2019t want you to ask her about it. I would think the same thing as you in this situation.", "NTA. Holy crap that\u2019s a ridiculous overreaction. Does he often overreact like this? Jeez.", "NTA. He is still way too immature for marriage.", "NTA, and bf's reaction is way off the rails. Talk to him about the issue right now. Meanwhile, while it is a sweet gesture to ask a parent permission to marry their daughter, it's completely unnecessary nowadays. If you and bf want to get married, you just get engaged and plan your wedding. Once you're an adult, even if the parent says no you can still get married; it's not like the legal ability of two adults to get married hinges on getting \"permission.\" The only people who need permission to legally marry in most countries are minors.", "NTA. It's probably best to call the wedding and entire relationship off now before your boyfriend gets even crazier.", "NTA. What did he expect you to do? He could easily have anticipated that you would ask your mother for the reasons.", "\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 NTA", "I think this is a bit ESH. \n\nConfronting your mom about something your partner reported back to you is something the two of you should be on the same page with. It was his interaction and you talking to your mom has the potential to alter how she sees your partner. \n\n*But*, his behaviour in the aftermath is bizarre and not proportionate to what you did. I would really have a think about that.", "Slight YTA.\n\nSure your bf response is also a bit in asshole territory, but the act of contacting your mother about something he told you, doing all this by telephone (to your mom, to him) instead of in conversations is weird to me. \n\nYou could've told him you were going to talk about it. Telling your partner something doesn't equal someone needing to react and act without discussing that. He felt the need to ask her premission, and basically you disregarded his sole part in that and 'helped' him with it. \n\n And if you do like talking with your mom like that, without communicating this to him, maybe it's something she should pick up with your bf, instead of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I totally marry you but your mom doesn't think it's time etc.  \n\nAnd by talking to your mom you took that away as a reason for not getting married.  So instead he's flipping you talking to her as a reason not to get married.\n\nAs to why he doesn't get married, I don't know.  But he's acting sus.  And you deserve an answer. \n\nIf not, it might be time to move on because otherwise the situation is telling me he doesn't want to marry you.", "Marinara flags all around.

But if people listened to Reddit no one would ever get married, they\u2019d break up at the first bad fight.", "Agreed, but OP's boyfriend literally said he'll probably never get over this minor quibble.", "He said it in the moment. They\u2019ve been together for six years and you\u2019re like \u201che said that one thing in this argument it\u2019s probably not hyperbole you need to end it.\u201d Geez Louise!", "It's not just the phrase, he went ballistic at OP. Sure, how previous fights (if any) were handled is a factor, but it doesn't bode well for the future.", "NTA\n\nHe doesn't want to propose. He's trying to create reasons not to. He might even want to break up and is just throwing any excuse against the wall until one of them sticks.\n\nHave a calm discussion with him and ask what the actual problem is. If he continues to escalate his unreasonable reactions, you shouldn't be marrying him anyway.", "It seems like your boyfriend is wildly embarrassed that the normally just for show asking for hand in marriage went South. It\u2019s probably eating him up inside that it didn\u2019t go his way, give him some time to cool off. If he doesn\u2019t, maybe start taking a deeper look at how he handles rejection. Not the greenest of flags right here.", "red flag.\n\nyou are NTA, but you've just witnessed your fiance's true character. he's controlling and domineering. he will not change.", "NTA, Your BF is crazy.  It's probably ok though.\n\nGive him a couple days and he'll realize you were on his side the whole time.

Are you sure you  want to marry THAT person?", "NTA I could see him being uncomfortable with you confronting your mom about something he's privately shared with you in general. But given that it is specific to him trying to get her blessing to marry you I think it makes sense that you would reach out to her to clear the air and listen in case she has any insight about him that you may have missed. \n\nI bet your bf doesn't want to marry you and he thought he could use your mom's reaction as an excuse for a while. But now that she's given her blessing he'll be expected to pop the question soon and that's why he's angry.", "NTA, your bf\u2019s reaction is not normal. Maybe he was using it as an excuse to not get engaged? Either way, not ok", "NTA. There is no secret being aired out.", "NTA. It sounds like he's looking for excuses to not get married. Unless he usually acts like this, in which case, don't get married.", "Sounds like he is intentionally causing reasons to not propose or to make you break up with him so he doesn't have to be the one to break up. \n\nIf I were you, I'd tell him I need space for a few months to see if this relationship has run its course.", "NTA I would have done the exact same thing. Is he allergic to conversations?", "YTA. He told you in confidence. He didn\u2019t want you to \u201crescue\u201d him, but to listen. You violated this. He needed to process his feelings about it and perhaps have another go with your mom, but now you ruined it.  He may not want to marry you now.  So sad.", "Yup his reaction was so off? I feel like he is kinda trying to isolate her from her mom, trying to create resentment between them. \nI think he hoped he would complain about her mom not accepting him and that she would blindly trust his word, and guilt trip her into being just bf/gf \"because your mom doesnt support us\", all the while separating her from her support system.", "It's not a sweet gesture to ask permission, perhaps to ask for a blessing", "I agree tbh, while the context isn't 100% clear to me I think you should've talked about it better before you called the mom. Him telling her definitely shouldn't mean confronting it right away, unless you got the feeling that was his intention\n\nEdit: i do feel like he overreacted too. You cleared out the issue and while i understand he maybe wanted to do it himself, it shouldn't be this big of a deal", "No one comes to Reddit because their relationship is fantastic.
