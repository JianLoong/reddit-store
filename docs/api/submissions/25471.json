Or that your mother response made him change his mind and used what you told him as an excuse to break things with you?\nBecause if he really loves you, he need to apologies for the way he treated you.

He is still way too immature for marriage.", "NTA, and bf's reaction is way off the rails. Talk to him about the issue right now. Meanwhile, while it is a sweet gesture to ask a parent permission to marry their daughter, it's completely unnecessary nowadays. If you and bf want to get married, you just get engaged and plan your wedding. Once you're an adult, even if the parent says no you can still get married; it's not like the legal ability of two adults to get married hinges on getting \"permission.\" The only people who need permission to legally marry in most countries are minors.", "NTA. It's probably best to call the wedding and entire relationship off now before your boyfriend gets even crazier.", "NTA. What did he expect you to do?

It was his interaction and you talking to your mom has the potential to alter how she sees your partner. \n\n*But*, his behaviour in the aftermath is bizarre and not proportionate to what you did. I would really have a think about that.", "Slight YTA.\n\nSure your bf response is also a bit in asshole territory, but the act of contacting your mother about something he told you, doing all this by telephone (to your mom, to him) instead of in conversations is weird to me. \n\nYou could've told him you were going to talk about it. Telling your partner something doesn't equal someone needing to react and act without discussing that. He felt the need to ask her premission, and basically you disregarded his sole part in that and 'helped' him with it. \n\n And if you do like talking with your mom like that, without communicating this to him, maybe it's something she should pick up with your bf, instead of you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not malicious, but a bit thoughtless.

Is there any reason you would question her judgement?  \n\nThe times where a reasonable family members didn\u2019t like a bf/ gf\u2014 well in my close circle, that was always the case where the marriage turned out bad.

My mom & dad were shocked I told him that. They weren\u2019t expecting it. My husband didn\u2019t think he had to do it. I asked because it was more asking that he could join the family. Not that I\u2019m owned by my parents. At me wedding my dad walked me down the aisle and high 5\u2019ed at the end. The officiant said, \u201cTphan is her own woman.
