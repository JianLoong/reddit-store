{"id": 17833, "submission_id": "13nyci6", "title": "AITA for not letting a family use our pump for their deflated ball?", "selftext": "My boyfriend and I belong to a local community center with a few basketball courts. Sometimes on the weekends we like to go there just shoot around and have fun.\n\nUnfortunately, the balls the community center has are almost always slightly deflated for some reason. You can remedy this by either bringing your own ball or your own pump. Since I already have a pump for my bike we usually just bring that and let other people use it too if they ask nicely. \n\nWe had the court to ourselves when a mom with her two 8-10 year old boys arrives. No big deal, they can use the other side of the court. The kids started playing and were having trouble with the deflated ball. Mom who was sitting and watching nearby noticed this, and noticed that our ball was pumped.\n\nShe came up to us and said we need to let her kids have a turn with the ball we were using, since it was the only good one. I told her that they\u2019re all always deflated and that we actually brought a pump to fix one so we could use it. I said she couldn\u2019t have our ball, but she was welcome to use the pump to inflate the one her kids had. \n\nShe seemed offended by this and scoffed at me. \u201cI supposed you\u2019re not even going to inflate it for us?\u201d I kind of paused because I was taken aback, but then responded. \n\nMe:\u201d No, I wasn\u2019t, but I\u2019ve changed my mind\u2014\u201c\n\nHer: \u201cGood!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYeah, now I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to let you use it at all.\u201d \n\nI turned back to my boyfriend and we started playing again, ignoring her stammering about how rude we were. The kids were watching the whole time and didnt say a word. They started playing again too until the mom got frustrated with us ignoring her, took them and left. \n\nAfter they left my boyfriend said I went too far. He agreed she was rude, but said I should have let them use the pump because in the end it meant the mom got mad and the kids couldn\u2019t play anymore. While I do feel bad for them, I wasn\u2019t going to let their entitled mother steamroll me. I think that\u2019s setting a bad precedent for both her and for her kids that they will all learn that they can just bully people into doing everything for them. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1684683967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nyci6/aita_for_not_letting_a_family_use_our_pump_for/", "score": 4156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Sounds like at the end of the Convo she's walking away mad because you said you wouldn't pump there ball up, lady is out of her mind", "NTA. She's perfectly capable of pumping the ball if the kids aren't. She just wanted to be lazy and let people who aren't responsible for the kids with her do the task.

She'll learn to be less choosey when she's begging eventually.", "NTA, if she didn't know how to use the pump, she could have asked for help not demand it. You've been kind enough to loan her your pump, she pushed her entitlement too far. Sadly her kids did suffer though.", "NTA  She was either crazy entitled or had a screw loose to ask you to inflate it for her in that tone.  You were right not to encourage her to act like that.  Her kids lost out because of her, not you.", "I would have ignored the mother, invited the boys over, and worked on getting their ball inflated with them doing the work and you directing it.\n\nBut, my Mom was a teacher and I can play those games well.", "NTA\n\nYou should repost in choosing beggars", "NTA.\n\nPeople can't read it seems. \n\nThe mother could always say \"im sorry, I was rude\"\n\nEveryone feels bad for the kids but the huge trauma here is 'mom was an asshole again' not 'our ball was deflated'", "I don't understand the mindset of this mother. I've spent a lot of time in gyms and on playing fields of all kinds with my kids over the years. If my kids were issued a crappy ball and I saw you playing with a decent one, I might ask, \"do you bring your own ball with you?\" or \"That ball looks like it's actually got air in it. Is there a place here to pump them up that I'm not aware of?\"\n\nIf I was truly inept and unable to pump up my child's basketball when offered a pump, I might sheepishly ask you to show me how it works because \"sports are not my thing.\" (Though my boys at 8 and 10 absolutely knew how to do it for themselves) But never in a million years would I expect you to give up the ball you're using or do the work for me.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe demanded your ball directly. You told her how you solved the situation and then offered her the pump so she could do the same. She got huffy that you first wouldn't give the ball to her kids and then that you expected them to pump the ball themselves (with your loaned pump). \n\nAt that point I'd also have rescinded the offer of the pump because up to that point you'd been entirely polite and reasonable and she was spoiling for a fight the second she didn't get her way.\n\nSucks for the kids though.", "Definitely NTA.

I get the desire to be petty in this situation, but really her kids are the ones that suffer.
