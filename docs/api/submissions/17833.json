{"id": 17833, "submission_id": "13nyci6", "title": "AITA for not letting a family use our pump for their deflated ball?", "selftext": "My boyfriend and I belong to a local community center with a few basketball courts. Sometimes on the weekends we like to go there just shoot around and have fun.\n\nUnfortunately, the balls the community center has are almost always slightly deflated for some reason. You can remedy this by either bringing your own ball or your own pump. Since I already have a pump for my bike we usually just bring that and let other people use it too if they ask nicely. \n\nWe had the court to ourselves when a mom with her two 8-10 year old boys arrives. No big deal, they can use the other side of the court. The kids started playing and were having trouble with the deflated ball. Mom who was sitting and watching nearby noticed this, and noticed that our ball was pumped.\n\nShe came up to us and said we need to let her kids have a turn with the ball we were using, since it was the only good one. I told her that they\u2019re all always deflated and that we actually brought a pump to fix one so we could use it. I said she couldn\u2019t have our ball, but she was welcome to use the pump to inflate the one her kids had. \n\nShe seemed offended by this and scoffed at me. \u201cI supposed you\u2019re not even going to inflate it for us?\u201d I kind of paused because I was taken aback, but then responded. \n\nMe:\u201d No, I wasn\u2019t, but I\u2019ve changed my mind\u2014\u201c\n\nHer: \u201cGood!\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cYeah, now I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to let you use it at all.\u201d \n\nI turned back to my boyfriend and we started playing again, ignoring her stammering about how rude we were. The kids were watching the whole time and didnt say a word. They started playing again too until the mom got frustrated with us ignoring her, took them and left. \n\nAfter they left my boyfriend said I went too far. He agreed she was rude, but said I should have let them use the pump because in the end it meant the mom got mad and the kids couldn\u2019t play anymore. While I do feel bad for them, I wasn\u2019t going to let their entitled mother steamroll me. I think that\u2019s setting a bad precedent for both her and for her kids that they will all learn that they can just bully people into doing everything for them. \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1684683967, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13nyci6/aita_for_not_letting_a_family_use_our_pump_for/", "score": 733, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's perfectly capable of pumping the ball if the kids aren't. She just wanted to be lazy and let people who aren't responsible for the kids with her do the task.

Her kids lost out because of her, not you.", "I would have ignored the mother, invited the boys over, and worked on getting their ball inflated with them doing the work and you directing it.\n\nBut, my Mom was a teacher and I can play those games well.", "NTA\n\nYou should repost in choosing beggars", "NTA.\n\nPeople can't read it seems. \n\nThe mother could always say \"im sorry, I was rude\"\n\nEveryone feels bad for the kids but the huge trauma here is 'mom was an asshole again' not 'our ball was deflated'", "I don't understand the mindset of this mother. I've spent a lot of time in gyms and on playing fields of all kinds with my kids over the years. If my kids were issued a crappy ball and I saw you playing with a decent one, I might ask, \"do you bring your own ball with you?\" or \"That ball looks like it's actually got air in it. Is there a place here to pump them up that I'm not aware of?\"\n\nIf I was truly inept and unable to pump up my child's basketball when offered a pump, I might sheepishly ask you to show me how it works because \"sports are not my thing.\" (Though my boys at 8 and 10 absolutely knew how to do it for themselves) But never in a million years would I expect you to give up the ball you're using or do the work for me.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe demanded your ball directly. You told her how you solved the situation and then offered her the pump so she could do the same. She got huffy that you first wouldn't give the ball to her kids and then that you expected them to pump the ball themselves (with your loaned pump). \n\nAt that point I'd also have rescinded the offer of the pump because up to that point you'd been entirely polite and reasonable and she was spoiling for a fight the second she didn't get her way.\n\nSucks for the kids though.", "Definitely NTA.

Not in the slightest.", "OP\u2019s refusal did not hurt anyone, the kids were still enjoying playing with the deflated ball. It\u2019s the entitled mother who didn\u2019t enjoy anything and stopped them. \n\nOP offered to help, entitled mother demanded for more. Withdrawing help after being bitten by people is not wrong and shouldn\u2019t be criticize for it. No one is entitled to help from others especially when they are so entitled and rude about it", "She didnt ask, she demanded.\n\nIf she had asked nicely to use the ball, or if she had asked nicely to use the pump I would have had a different reaction. \n\nShe scoffed at me and insisted I do everything for them and I was rude if I didn\u2019t.", "If this is TL:DR, you're in the wrong sub, mate.", "Doubt she'll learn anything. Hopefully the kids will though.", "NTA. She could politely ask you to pump the ball. Problem would be solved.", "She taught the kids that when you're rude and demanding, you don't get what you want.", "screw the high road. you know that's why people act entitled like that. they expect to be a jerk and that people will just take the high road so they can continue being a jerk and getting what they want! sometimes older women ESPECIALLY need a not so nice lesson taught to them. OP is NTA for not putting up with that garbage attitude. just because YOU'RE okay with being a doormat doesn't mean they should be.", "I think the issue was more that the mum fully expected OP to do it, without even asking, just assuming. If the mum couldn't work it, she can say I'm really sorry, I'm not sure how to use it and I'd hate to break it do you mind helping me. Or something like that. I'm sure OP and most other people would oblige when asked in a decent way. Nothing about the way the mum spoke as advised in the post can be described as decent!", "NTA\n\nOP did teach those children a life lesson. OP taught them that when you\u2019re disrespectful and entitled, the world won\u2019t bend over backwards for you. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t have to teach the children to share. It\u2019s literally a parents responsibility to teach their children that everyone doesn\u2019t have to share with them.", "The kids learned that if they don't treat people with respect they shouldn't expect anything from them in return. That's a freebie since it was never on OP to teach them anything in the first place.\n\nNTA.", "But the problem wasn't that op expected this woman and her kids to pump the ball themselves.\n\nThe problem was this woman was put out that op didn't want the kids to use her ball and was rude to op when she offered the pump.\n\nIt sounds like if she had been grateful and asked for help, op would've helped them.\n\nDoesn't even sound like this woman wanted the pump honestly, she was just mad about the ball.", "Yeah clear NTA. Let your conscience be guilt free.", "Yeah you are NTA here please don't worry about it", "I bet she didn\u2019t know how to use it and was too self conscious to say that, and chose to be an ass. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re thinking how hard can it be, but people struggle with new things sometimes.", "Guessing this was the motivation.  Ideally should've advised the kids to \"go ask those people nicely if they know how to fix the ball.\"", "Yeah, pumping a ball doesn't leave alot of room for error. The way it works  is pretty obvious, even if you've never seen it done before.", "Yeah, but maybe showing the kids how to use the pump for the ball DESPITE how rude their mother was would have been a better lesson that you do not punish kids for their parents' behavior, and you would have been a hero to those kids.", "Or maybe the kids would learn that even though their mom acts like a jerk, there are still kind adults willing to overlook it to help them out. They should model that behavior.", "To crush 'em on the court with their height advantage. \n\n\nI was mostly joking. I do still think  ESH, although lightly, and OP is more right than not. It's still OPs pump. Just seems like a missed opportunity to take the high road and maybe do a good thing, especially in a communal space.", "Except the entitled mother\u2019s pride", "Read my whole comment, please. Don't just focus on the bit that grings your gears.", "Good point. They\u2019ll have seen firsthand that being a jerk gets you nowhere. Hopefully that translates to treating people with respect.", "I have a rule when it comes to children - a tantrum means an automatic \"no\". It's a matter of not giving positive reinforcement to negative behaviors.\n\nIt applies just as well to entitled adults.", "Amen!", "Oof, they might need some burn cream for that one", "This! And I am absolutely sick of people minimizing jerk/asshole behavior and telling the nice person it's somehow their job to placate those people. All that does is emboldens them to keep being exactly like that. The more we tell those people to fuck off the less likely they are to keep pulling the same crap when they see it isn't working for them.", "This. In Mom's shoes, I would have asked OP if they would show me how to use the pump if I didn't know how, explaining that I didn't want to damage their property. I have a feeling that would have gone over better. Either way, NTA. Sucks for the kids, but OP is under no obligation to let someone use their stuff when that someone has demonstrated so little respect for others. If Mom had damaged the pump, she probably would have blamed OP and demanded the inflated ball as compensation.", "If she had said that I wouldn\u2019t mind helping her. Not the way she acted though. Rudeness and guilt tripping gets you nowhere with me.", "Maaaaybe", "Read my whole story please. Don\u2019t just focus on the bit that grings your gears. You also edited your comment.", "I'm the same way with my children. And yes, it should apply to all ages", "Is your bf always a doormat? O does he wants you to be one? He needs an attitude adjustment. NTA", "Exactly. Hopefully she was just having a bad day and isn\u2019t an ass all the time. But clearly she was an ass this time."]}
