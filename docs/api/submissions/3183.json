It was hosted by my dad\u2019s aunt who raised him and had us, her step-daughter\u2019s family, and her bio son and his family. My aunt raised my dad from age 3 so I call her my grandma and her bio kids my aunt and uncle. My mom and I have a very strained relationship with this side of the family. They have always been awful to my mom, have humiliated her at every opportunity for the past 40 years, and since I\u2019m her daughter, they don\u2019t think too much of me either. My dad has never stuck up for her because he feels like he owes my grandma for raising him and in his words, \u201cdoesn\u2019t want to make waves.\u201d This is the only point of tension in their marriage. My mom finally went off on my aunt earlier this year, and we haven\u2019t talked at all since. However, we got an invitation for Thanksgiving and since my grandma is planning to move across the country to live with her bio daughter, my dad wanted to go so he could tell her goodbye in person. \n\nAt meal time, my uncle started \u201cteasing\u201d me about still living at home (I just got a good paying job and am planning on moving out in the springtime.). He was saying he would be embarrassed to have a child my age still living at home, basically called me a failure, and at one point alluded to the fact the reason I still live at home is because I wasn\u2019t raised right, and I swear he looked my mom dead in the eyes when he said it. Everyone at the table was laughing the entire time. I got up with my mom, basically told them all to stuff it, and left. \n \nMy dad followed and while he agreed that what my uncle said was wrong, he asked why I had to cause a scene, that we would probably never see them again and I should\u2019ve just keep the peace. He said he just wanted a chance to tell her goodbye and now he didn\u2019t get that. I\u2019ve been getting texts from family about how disrespectful I was all night, some who I didn\u2019t know even had my number.\n\nI\u2019m starting to feel guilty for taking the goodbyes away from them. I could\u2019ve corrected them in a more respectful way. So what do you think Reddit, AITA for how I handled the situation?\n\nEdit because this is absolutely hilarious: my mom just informed me that my uncle moved out of grandmas house one day before his 30th birthday so he had absolutely no right to even judge me in the first place.", "created_utc": 1669341372, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z40t3i/aita_for_ruining_my_dads_last_thanksgiving_with/", "score": 80, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If your dad wanted a peaceful thanksgiving then he had 3 choices. He could have gone alone, he could have made it clear that everyone was to keep their opinions to themselves and stay silent unless they were happy thoughts about your grandmother, or he could have gone another day to see her.

Sometimes you just swallow your pride to keep the peace. Maybe you feel justified, but the result was it effected other people.

I think I would write a thank you note:  thanks, as usual for the classy Thanksgiving dinner, and apparently you forgot that you lived at home until you were literally 30.

He's making you and your mom pay what he feels like is his debt.\n\nIt's one thing to be there for people who have been there for you, it's another to offer up your family to be abused for thier entertainment.\n\nHe doesn't owe them anything. They have already used up their goodwill by using you and your mom as mental punching bags.\n\nYour dad could have seen them alone to say goodbye. On any other day. He can still do that. Instead, he's upset you didn't stand for being abused. Let me say this again, your dad wanted you to take being abused, humiliated and belittled. For his relatives entertainment. And the same for your mom.\n\nYou are NTA. As is your mom. The rest are assholes. I feel like your dad has been brainwashed by them to believe he \"owes\" them so much, he was only 3 when they got ahold of him. But he is grown, and either needs to realize this is wrong or go to therapy to get deprogrammed."]}
