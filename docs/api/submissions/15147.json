Usually parents feel terrible that the sick kid can't enjoy life the way the healthy kid does, so they try to compensate by doting more on the sick kid. They very well might have been trying to spend as much time with him before he died (which sounds like it could have been a possibility back then).\n\nYour parents were probably aware of how you were responding to this situation and didn't want you to suffer because of all the attention they had to give to James's sickness. They arranged for you to stay with family and that usually requires quite a LOT of behind-the-scenes details that you probably never knew about, from your legal care to healthcare, guardianship, education, etc - I'd bet that your uncle and his wife were probably in contact quite a bit with your parents about you and just never told you.\n\nOnce James got better, you were already very happy with your current living situation. Selfish parents would probably just want to take you back home but I'd be willing to bet that they had a long conversation about it and figured you seemed happier where you were, and they likely didn't want to uproot your life again, especially if there was any chance of James getting sick again.\n\nOverall, your parents likely love you very much and the way things went down FELT like abandonment but it was them trying to give you a happy life. So if that's the reality here, then what you said might feel like they are getting punished by you for doing what they thought was best.\n\nHowever, all of that is just a guess based on a lot of assumptions, so you should probably have a conversation with them and lay it all out and tell them how you feel and give them a chance to say their side, as well.\n\nYou are an adult now and you're capable of understanding difficult life choices now a lot better than you could as a kid when all of this was happening, so give them a chance.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour parents already gave you away.", "NTA - Your real family is the people who love you and are part of your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Or that they at some point realized how they were neglecting you and that\u2019s why you were sent.  Then you went on further and I thought, ok, maybe they want to keep them with the Uncle because of consistency and to be sure the twin is truly better?  But 5 years?! And you don\u2019t call or see your child??!!! Wow.  I\u2019m so sorry, OP.  \n\nAbsolutely have whoever you want walk you down the aisle, and it certainly sounds as though your Uncle is the one who deserves that honor.

I think maybe only AH part was the laugh when he asked but I feel like it was a visceral reaction and kind of deserved anyway. So yeah, NTA for sure.", "NTA but I can\u2019t help but feel a little bit sorry for your parents. I\u2019m sure they did the best they could.  You could have answered your father with a little more tact. It\u2019s not about who \u201cdeserves\u201d the honor. It\u2019s about who you want to walk you.  You could have said that your father made a great and courageous choice when he sought the help of your aunt and uncle to raise you.  And because they did, you would feel more comfortable with your uncle walking down the aisle. \n\nI can\u2019t help but think you are very angry and looking to punish your parents.  Maybe therapy can help you find peace.", "NTA. I agree. He\u2019s trying to do takesies-backsies without doing the work to even try to repair your relationship. Did they ever ask if you wanted to go home, or even attempt to keep in touch? If not, then I don\u2019t understand why they would assume you\u2019d be all set for that. \n\nThey gave you away years ago and it doesn\u2019t sound like they did much to even be a part of your life - their son\u2019s TWIN. And your brother being the one they clearly cherished more has no idea what the world is like with parents who would just toss him away like  his TWIN. None of them really understand just how betrayed you feel about it despite your aunt and uncle being your de facto parents and loving them.  That is the crux of the issue. I would have a conversation with your brother and give him your perspective on how his health challenges cost you a lot. Not from a blaming perspective but as a kid whose birth parents were so limited in their capacity to love, they gave you away instead of loving you too. And never tried to be there for you growing up. Now, they want a position of honor at your wedding, when your uncle deserves it for actually acting and being your Dad for all intents and purposes. That doesn\u2019t make you the AH. It does make your parents realize they have been and that\u2019s why they are upset. I hope they will begin to see what they have wrought with their decisions.

Doing traditions because it's a tradition is dumb, especially when those traditions were started for sexist reasons.\n\nI have seen where both the groom and bride walk down the isle with their parents (or 1 or 2 important figures in their lives) as a sign that these people raised them and helped make them who they are today.\n\nAlso the white dress tradition was started by Queen Victoria in the 1800's. Before that it was customary for the woman to wear a fancy, highly embroidered dress with different colors.\n\nEventually the white in the white dress was to symbolizes \"purity\", which I still think is outdated thinking.\n\nI also look terrible in white so if I ever get married I'm not going to be in a white dress. I'll just look washed out.", "Some people do. Personally I find the idea that any of it is *necessary* as being outdated.
