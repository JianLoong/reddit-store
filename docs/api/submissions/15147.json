I\u2019m baffled at the way that some parents treat their children, and then they wonder why their children don\u2019t want to talk when they grow up.

Secondly, it sounds like your uncle and aunt were surrogate parents to you, and you feel closer to them than to your biological parents. It makes sense for you to acknowledge that closeness in your wedding.  \n\nCongratulations on your impending nuptials.", "NTA it\u2019s your day he can be invited but your wish is your uncle. That sucks the Inequality he did but these are his consequences.", "NTA - How you choose to live your life is not your brother\u2019s business and whom you choose to walk you down the aisle is also your no one\u2019s business but yours.", "Absolutely NTA! Your wedding your choice to honor the person who supported you through your childhood!", "NTA. Your parents learned the consequences of their abandonment of you. I hope your wedding goes well!", "NTA    tell him he gave you away as a child, and he can't do it twice. You want someone who was there for you to do it.\n\nParents shouldn't abandon one child to care for another, and your parents dropped the ball.\n\nYour feelings are valid, and you should let your uncle do this, it will be something special you will always remember. \n\nThe only credit I would give your parents, would be who they gave you to.", "You can have whomever you want walk you down the aisle.\n\nThat said, it is worth saying that \"extremely sick kid vs. healthy kid\" situations are complicated.\n\nIt can often feel like the parents love the sick child more. Usually parents feel terrible that the sick kid can't enjoy life the way the healthy kid does, so they try to compensate by doting more on the sick kid. They very well might have been trying to spend as much time with him before he died (which sounds like it could have been a possibility back then).\n\nYour parents were probably aware of how you were responding to this situation and didn't want you to suffer because of all the attention they had to give to James's sickness. They arranged for you to stay with family and that usually requires quite a LOT of behind-the-scenes details that you probably never knew about, from your legal care to healthcare, guardianship, education, etc - I'd bet that your uncle and his wife were probably in contact quite a bit with your parents about you and just never told you.\n\nOnce James got better, you were already very happy with your current living situation. Selfish parents would probably just want to take you back home but I'd be willing to bet that they had a long conversation about it and figured you seemed happier where you were, and they likely didn't want to uproot your life again, especially if there was any chance of James getting sick again.\n\nOverall, your parents likely love you very much and the way things went down FELT like abandonment but it was them trying to give you a happy life. So if that's the reality here, then what you said might feel like they are getting punished by you for doing what they thought was best.\n\nHowever, all of that is just a guess based on a lot of assumptions, so you should probably have a conversation with them and lay it all out and tell them how you feel and give them a chance to say their side, as well.\n\nYou are an adult now and you're capable of understanding difficult life choices now a lot better than you could as a kid when all of this was happening, so give them a chance.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour parents already gave you away.", "NTA - Your real family is the people who love you and are part of your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have a great relationship with my Dad. But he didn't walk me down the aisle. (Something that wasn't really a problem for him either.)\n\nEdit to clarify: nobody walked me down the aisle either. Just my lacy butt. You do you boo!", "I never considered it this way I will definitely ask them about this", "Great response.\n\nI suspect there was a lot of anguish behind the scenes for the parents. And complex discussions and decisions that would be hard for young kid\u2019s to understand.\n\nThough sounds like they could have done better.\n\nThat said - OPs wedding; OPs call. NTA.\n\nDepending on what answers OP gets, perhaps they could both walk her down the aisle; one on each side.", "As a healthy kid with a sick sibling, this rings true to me. It happened when I was older so I was able to understand a lot of the difficult choices my parents needed to make and have some amount of patience and kindness about the whole ordeal. As an elementary aged kid I wouldn\u2019t have had that capacity. Honestly even as a high school aged kid I wasn\u2019t perfectly graceful about the situation. But being older definitely helped a lot!\n\nWe don\u2019t have enough information to know for sure. But from OP\u2019s story, this is my take away as well.\n\nIt\u2019s such a miserable thing for a family. I hope OP can heal some of the relationships that her brother\u2019s sickness hurt.", "Yep. It's always the bride's call, really. I love my kids and even if I was the best dad in the world, if they someday get married and choose not to have me involved, I would be hurt but I would understand that it's their wedding.\n\nRegardless of who walks her down, I am truly hoping that there can be some reconciliation between her and her folks. Life is hard enough."]}
