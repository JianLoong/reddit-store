Usually parents feel terrible that the sick kid can't enjoy life the way the healthy kid does, so they try to compensate by doting more on the sick kid. They very well might have been trying to spend as much time with him before he died (which sounds like it could have been a possibility back then).\n\nYour parents were probably aware of how you were responding to this situation and didn't want you to suffer because of all the attention they had to give to James's sickness. They arranged for you to stay with family and that usually requires quite a LOT of behind-the-scenes details that you probably never knew about, from your legal care to healthcare, guardianship, education, etc - I'd bet that your uncle and his wife were probably in contact quite a bit with your parents about you and just never told you.\n\nOnce James got better, you were already very happy with your current living situation. Selfish parents would probably just want to take you back home but I'd be willing to bet that they had a long conversation about it and figured you seemed happier where you were, and they likely didn't want to uproot your life again, especially if there was any chance of James getting sick again.\n\nOverall, your parents likely love you very much and the way things went down FELT like abandonment but it was them trying to give you a happy life. So if that's the reality here, then what you said might feel like they are getting punished by you for doing what they thought was best.\n\nHowever, all of that is just a guess based on a lot of assumptions, so you should probably have a conversation with them and lay it all out and tell them how you feel and give them a chance to say their side, as well.\n\nYou are an adult now and you're capable of understanding difficult life choices now a lot better than you could as a kid when all of this was happening, so give them a chance.\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour parents already gave you away.", "NTA - Your real family is the people who love you and are part of your life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
