I had a partner who strung me along, it was devastating to find out thats what he was doing, and it's part of why I was older when I found my current partner and had kids.  It's hard to be an older parent knowing you have less time on this earth with them just due to age alone.  Sure men can have children well into their senior years but that's not the issue here. People who do not want or are not going to have children really need to set people free who want them to find an appropriate partner.  Cliche here but if you truly love him, set him free.
