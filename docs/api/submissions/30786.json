With such little context outside of the woman\u2019s own husband who was there (with more context than the rest of us) disagreeing with his own wife, she could be in the wrong. \ud83e\udd23\n\nWe don\u2019t know if the man had left for a second to get a drink, a fork, a napkin or anything and got his seat swiped. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd", "It\u2019s pretty clearly not THAT common", "OP\u2019s story is conflicting. She didn\u2019t mention this initially, then in subsequent comments has gotten passive aggressive when people asked for an approximate time frame, and she went onto say it was about less than 8 minutes (time it takes to go to the loo; who knows if the man was sitting there prior and got up the moment OP walked in to use the restroom). \n\nSo, again, it\u2019s hard to assess whether OP is a reliable narrator (passive aggression could indicate she\u2019s not; her husband disagreeing with more context than we have re: what she had done also could indicate this). OP even shared that she saw the bag *then sat down before her husband* to save a seat for him while he was getting additional food so why was it not fair for the lone man with the bag to use his bag in the way that she used her body (as a hold for the table) while her husband retrieved additional food?", "Again, this still doesn\u2019t mean it was right for OP to take the man\u2019s seat he saved and doesn\u2019t justify the less than 8 minute time frame that she snagged his seat and saved it instead while waiting for her husband (like OP was doing essentially by placing a bag at the table). For all we know, the lone man with the bag was there and sitting at the table prior to OP\u2019s arrival and had simply placed his shopping bag on the table to go to the loo (it\u2019s not uncommon for people to sit bags down on tables because they don\u2019t want to hold a bunch of items in the restroom).\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/e8CJWGz9fX", "Right? But wouldn\u2019t that just indicate that he had claimed the table for even LESS time than she\u2019s making it sound like? Only the amount of time between her ordering and before their food came. That\u2019s not long. Maybe he was ordering and then put his stuff there while they went up to order. Then went to the bathroom to wash up before his food came.", "lol okay \ud83d\udc4d", "I don\u2019t care what he thought. He had his bag. I hope he checked inside it just to make sure nothing was stolen. I really couldn\u2019t care any less about a stranger\u2019s bag.", "Answered to a question below - Here in the US also, I don\u2019t mind sharing tables when asked for it. I have asked people if I can share their table when there weren\u2019t any open tables at restaurants and they allowed me to do so. We shared the tables and we minded our own businesses.", "And I don\u2019t see what the problem is. It ensures that anyone buying food has a seat.", "I mean that's not necessarily evidence of that, but ok, I'll grant that if that's true, it lends weight to the likelihood he hadn't ordered yet. Honestly she comes across a bit of an unreliable narrator to me tho ngl >.>", "I don't think it's odd \ud83d\ude09.", "lol never again. I didn\u2019t know it was such a big deal here.", "Right there\u2019s definitely bars or restaurants that are set up to be more casually intimate and I\u2019ve experienced those.\n\nBut a random cafe/restaurant in New Jersey definitely isn\u2019t where I\u2019d be prepared to \u201cbond\u201d with random people lol", "Nah I get it I just feel like being stuck next to OP would give me indigestion. I do not believe based on her attitude here that she would have been fine with sharing a table. She\u2019s sounds like she\u2019s fine if she gets what she wants, but if anyone else has different opinions, she\u2019s suddenly not fine and how dare they.", "Get that shit before you sit down, this isn't brain surgery man.", "That's totally fine but completely irrelevant to this story as this is an open cafe and not a restaurant", "The OPs in these posts are the only word we have to go on.\n\nI\u2019m sure a lot of these posts are full of half truths from their narrators. We can only make a decision based on the info we are provided.", "It\u2019s a big deal everywhere. YTA. Rude and inconsiderate.", "Fair enough :) my point was more the guy didn\u2019t need to come at them at like 100%. If it was me I woulda just said nicely excuse my I had placed my bag here to save a seat while I \u201cxyz\u201d. He straight up made an instant enemy by yelling, and maybe they were cool and he\u2019d never know. I mean they could be dicks too so there\u2019s that.", "God forbid someone forgets LMAOOOOO. Lord have mercy. These Reddit responses have been so entertaining. \ud83d\ude2d\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23"]}
