I have never seen someone try to save a table by doing this, nor would I expect to. How much of an idiot are you to leave your belongings on a table around a bunch of strangers with nobody to watch over your things? If someone steals your stuff you don\u2019t blame them, you blame yourself because you were the idiot who left your shit unattended and expected it to be okay. Same logic applies here, if you set your bag in a seat then walk away for more than idk 60 seconds you automatically forfeit the seat.
