She can only ride one at a time and assuming you really are putting all of the upkeep on her, that's a LOT of responsibility on such a young kid. It's no wonder you think she could use a break.\n\nAs far as your eldest goes, you wanted to buy her younger sister a pair of field puppies and when she said she thought it was a bad idea you told her she would not have to take care of them. Then because she's being a 17 year old you decide to break your word to her to teach her a lesson. Lessons don't mean much coming from a lying teacher.\n\nI don't want to make assumptions but this is coming off more as you and your family weren't prepared for caring for two 1000 lb. creatures that you've saddled (*pause for laugh*) family with.", "I'm not going to call you ta but I don't think taking care of pets should be used as a punishment.

Two factors: 1) yes, the whole \"going back on your promise\" thing. It might not have been intentional, but your daugther feels like it is a whole big \"got you!\" and a lie. I completely can see how and why she has to feel that way. 2) you drag your younger daughter into this mess! You punish one daughter and give the other daughter \"days off\". Don't you think that will make daugther 1 resent daughter 2? Especially, since it is a punishment for being mean to the younger one? \n\nOn a side note: a horse is a really expensive gift. What did your older daughter get that is of equal value? A new car? A few years worth of club activities? A mini vacation with some friends? Because, just by this text alone so I might be off, it sounds like one of your daughters is the favourite and it is not the older one.", "Absolutely YTA. Find a punishment that\u2019s actually appropriate to the situation instead of being lazy. It\u2019s pretty obvious that you favor your 13 year old but at least TRY to be a decent parent to your 17 year old. Stop punishing for for not being excited for princess, golden child 13 year old.", "info: where did you spend $50k on your 17yo after buying her sister 2 horses? did you talk to your 17yo about how she\u2019s doing?", "YTA. Horses are super expensive and so is the upkeep. Your oldest daughter is having issues and you're confused why. Gee I wonder, she just watched her little sister get  the equivalent of a car spent on her. So what did you do that's equivalent for your oldest daughter? This is probably a pattern of behavior if you're so brazen that you'd drop tens of thousands on two horses for your youngest without a second thought. Your oldest is probably depressed, angry, and rightfully resentful. \n\nWhy are you shocked that she's lashing out at her younger sister? You created the mess and caused a rift between them. Her request to not have anything to do with the horses didn't come out of nowhere. She rightfully predicted you'd make her do her sister's chores. She has every right to be angry and act out when you broke your promise and disrespected her. She now knows for certain that your word means nothing. \n\nShe's almost 18. Keep up this kind of behavior, especially without ever bothering to empathize with her and help her, and you won't have a daughter anymore. She'll go no contact as soon as she's not depending on you anymore.\n\n* If anyone is confused about pricing look up costs for a quality riding horse, costs for a stable, costs for tack, and costs for feed, farrier, and vet care for a year. Now multiply care costs and horse cost by 2. \n\nLike an average just recreational riding horse costs $3-4k. A trained jumping horse for doing courses is about $10k a barrel racing horse is $10-20k. A Friesian for dressage is going to run $25-30k. Feed is around $300 a month per horse. It's about $500 a year for vet care but that's just wellness checks and vaccination etc. If you don't have a stable then you pay for boarding which depending on the type ranges from $200-2500 per month. On the other hand if you build your own stables it's $30k +. Farriers that come out and trim hooves and replace shoes cost on average about $37/ hour. \n\nSo let's go cheap with a basic riding horse and pasture boarding. So the cost of two of the cheapest horses plus all their care for a year is about $15k. That doesn't include any riding training which is about $20-120/hour in most places. The upper limits, say doing dressage and you built your own stable. Cost of 2 Friesian horses plus a small stable and care for a year is about $88k.", "Well, YTA.

Don't just stick her with an unrelated punishment.", "I think giving your 13 year old daughter two horses (not just one) is saying more about your dynamic with your daughters than you probably intended.  And her grades slipping and staying out late and whatnot is more about a possible problem family dynamic than a rebellious teenager just being rebellious.

That should not work out well for you at all. YTA. Not for punishing her, but for not keeping your word.", "YTA. As a parent, I get it - I do. But the logical response for grades slipping is removing the distractions that have caused that (no more electronic time, no more hanging out with friends, earlier curfew, etc). As for the disrespect of the sister, having her do her sister's chores is just going to lead to resentment, ESPECIALLY as it's a chore for animals she specifically didn't want and you said she wouldn't have to be involved with.", "Giving her her sisters chores is surely not going to instill a sense of sibling camaraderie and make her feel super regretful for being mean.

Figure out if there is a way to help her grades? Instead of punishing her with something YOU promised she wouldn't ever have to do? I get she needs to feel the consequences of her action but I honestly don't agree that her punishment fits the crime here.

The punishment is so hugely disproportionate that it makes 0 sense and I wouldn't be surprised if your 13y.o. tried to get her sister in trouble in the future to get out of taking care of HER animals.\n\nEven if you wanted to use the horses as punishment (which I'm totally against as you already promised she wouldn't have anything to do with them and changing the agreement based on arbitrary verbiage is nasty nasty business because you knew exactly what she meant and what she believed the understanding was) but let's say that promise had never been made  proportionate punishment would be your 17y.o. helping the 13y.o. do the horse work not completely letting the 13y.o. out of her responsibilities and putting them all on her sister.\n\nI really do not give a flying cow that 17y.o. was kind of shitty to 13y.o. seeing as you didn't give any specific examples I reckon it was normal sibling clash stuff.\n\nBut as you clearly favor the 13y.o. it doesn't matter what she did to instigate or otherwise bug the 17y.o. who again you just Cleary don't like based off 17y.o. interest.\n\nHuge YTA end of story and you're just going to foster resentment long term if you keep this up.

No.\n\nA logical consequence for staying out too late would be, she has to turn in her car keys for some length of time, or she\u2019s not allowed to go out for awhile or something.\n\nFor grades slipping, they need to get to the cause of the problem and react accordingly. Does she need tutoring? Is she in too many extracurriculars and needs to drop something? Is she staying out late enough that it is interfering with her sleep (so addressing the former problem should help)? Is she depressed? Is she dealing with some kind of high school drama? Is she playing on her phone too much and needs her phone taken away for a bit? There are lots of directions this could go, but taking care of livestock isn\u2019t helpful.\n\nAs for the disrespect and insults towards family, that deserves a serious conversation to start with.
