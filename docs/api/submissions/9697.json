I would bet that suddenly names matter a great deal. Names are a 2 yes process, or they should be. You both need to agree. \n\nAlso your husband is aware that the baby is 50% his genetically right? just because you carry them for 9 months, your not suddenly ahead in the baby loving you stakes or something. \n\nEither way you need to sit him down and have a proper talk about it. I also cant help but wonder if this is just a weird one off for your husband or does he often dismiss your thoughts/wants or ignore your opinion on things.

It\u2019s a two yeses situation. If he continues to be an ass about it, you don\u2019t need to involve him in the naming at all. You\u2019re not just some incubator for babies he gets to name on his own without regard for your opinions, you\u2019re the mother.", "NTA.  Seems like a reasonable suggestion.  A good marriage requires compromise and this sounds like a time for it.", "Geez I find these baby name AITA posts so wild. My husband is just happy for me to be happy, our babies will have his last name and he\u2019s happy and open to all my suggestions.

So far both first and middle names are of my choosing that he approves and is happy with.", "NTA. He's TA. He doesn't get to erase you, which is what he's doing. Names matter. If names didn't matter, he'd be fine with the kids either taking your last name or having their last names hyphenated. Maybe bring up that idea.

Tell him that he got the last name, you get the middle name and y\u2019all can agree on a first name.", "NTA. Does your husband often dismiss your thoughts and feelings? I hope this is not the case, but it feels hurtful to laugh off an emotional concern. Worth a meaningful discussion (either with therapy or just between you two) about how this is making you feel.", "NTA. My husband and I believe that middle names should be used for honoring people you love, reflecting traditions, etc. Basically, they should mean something. Our 3 kids have middle names after my grandparents and his mother's sister who died as a child. And they also have both of our last names (as in, if my last name is Smith and his is Johnson, they're Kid Middlename Smith Johnson). We did it because I'm Latin American and it's traditio all in my culture, but there's no reason you couldn't too, so your kids keep that tie to you. Besides - you're their mom. You get a freaking say too!\nEdited to add: Names matter a lot. They're the first thing people will know about your child. My mom cried when we told her our second child's middle name because it's my late grandfather's first name. Names mean something, and they should, and eve  if he disagrees, your husband needs to respect that you think they do.", "It\u2019s also ok to have 2 (or more) middle names", "NTA.

Does he often diminish your contributions? Does he often steamroll and belittle your feelings and opinions?

Tell him since you get no input on first and middle, then the last name is yours.", "NTA - you are literally doing 100% of the work of making the baby. You\u2019re giving them his last name (I don\u2019t understand not double barrelling when you\u2019re not sharing surnames, it just makes it easier for documentation etc later) and he has the audacity to alight that you\u2019re doing 100% of the work, so shouldn\u2019t get the say on middle names at the minimum?\n\nNTA - your husband is being a big AH with that comment.\n\nEdit: your husband is not pregnant with you.

Your child having their middle name from a member of your family is not a big ask.", "NTA but your husband certainly is. In what world does this child get one of his names and none of yours? Your kids \u201cget all of you?\u201d Aka, you literally have to do all the physical labor of building that child and he sees this as some kind of reward for you? Don\u2019t get me wrong, being pregnant IS a treasure but it\u2019s not like you then owe your partner something in return just because you have a womb and he doesn\u2019t.

That is not okay.", "Its a lovely way to honour your family side and they absolutely do matter. This would be a hill im willing to die on though.

I hope hubby reads this posting and comes to his senses\u2026particularly the sense that holds fairness and equality in high regard, but if he doesn\u2019t, insist on naming your child at birth. Isn\u2019t the birth certificate filled out at childbirth? If so, be fair and tell the person filling out the certificate to use the names your prefer. \n\nIf your husband is attending the birth and tries to interfere with the naming assert your rights as the mother or suggest \u201cbaby Doe\u201d if things get too emotional.\n\nOP, please do not give in to your husband. He obviously needs to learn to share authority in your marriage, and this baby naming dispute is a good time to get him on the right and fair track. At this point in your marriage, it is not too late but giving in now to hubby\u2019s unfairness will only lead to further fairness disputes down the road.", "Telling people to get a divorce for insensitive comments their partner made is insane to me.", "Yeah, but maybe she should bring this up to her husband who seems to think he's entitled to making the final decision", "You'll go through a lot of marriages if you aspire to drop divorce papers as quickly as this idiot.", "Denying your partner any say in naming your children is pretty big to me", "Because he\u2019s not a complete dumbass \ud83d\ude02", "You do know people make mistakes right ? People in a relationship *will* say things that hurt the other person from time to time. It happens. People apologize. People forgive.
