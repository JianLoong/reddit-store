And if he really thought it didn't matter he wouldn't have a problem with it.", "NTA. That\u2019s cruel of him to laugh off the suggestion. Naming requires two yesses, so I don\u2019t think he is obligated to agree to a name if your choice, but he\u2019s an asshole for not even being open minded.", "NTA. That was such an off handed comment from him. Just because it doesn't matter to him he shouldn't ignore that it matters to you.", "If names don't matter, then your husband shouldn't object to choosing names from your family.

It can cause issues when travelling and you may need his permission to travel with the child in the future.

I would bet that suddenly names matter a great deal. Names are a 2 yes process, or they should be. You both need to agree. \n\nAlso your husband is aware that the baby is 50% his genetically right? just because you carry them for 9 months, your not suddenly ahead in the baby loving you stakes or something. \n\nEither way you need to sit him down and have a proper talk about it. I also cant help but wonder if this is just a weird one off for your husband or does he often dismiss your thoughts/wants or ignore your opinion on things. Basically does this problem run deeper than this one thing and how is that going to work when decisions need to be made for your little one?", "Fun fact, before we registered the birth my kids name was \"Marzipan_civil'sgirl\" that's what they put on the hospital tag - mother's name, and girl or boy.", "NTA it\u2019s not unreasonable for the person who could die bringing the child in the world to get some say in the name. It\u2019s a two yeses situation. If he continues to be an ass about it, you don\u2019t need to involve him in the naming at all. You\u2019re not just some incubator for babies he gets to name on his own without regard for your opinions, you\u2019re the mother.", "NTA.  Seems like a reasonable suggestion.

If names didn't matter, he'd be fine with the kids either taking your last name or having their last names hyphenated. Maybe bring up that idea. If he balks, tell him that names don't matter, and they get him because they have half his DNA.

Your husband thinks middle names don't matter, but he refuses to even consider giving your child a middle name from your family.
