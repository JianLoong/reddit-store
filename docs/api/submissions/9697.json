That whole Jr. nonsense is waaaaay outdated and needs to stop.\n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re living that life though\u2026I mean you can legally change it if you want, it will just cost money and be a pain and take time for everyone to get used to it.", "Of course, but they don't sound like they've spent much time on the negotiating part.  He wants one thing, and she wants another.  They need to spend TIME together working it out.\n\nI can see this in their future.  Anniversary rolls around if they make it that far.  One of them spend 100 bucks on the present for the other one.  The other one spends 200 bucks.  Then they argue how that's not fair.  Who would want to live like that?", "Kinda, but he gets the last name and wants to also dictate the other names. He can't have full authority of all names and still call it fair", "> My mom felt strongly that she didn\u2019t want us having names that could be shortened because the name she gave us was our name\n\nThis part sounds shitty too. Sure you get to name your kids, but the name you pick isn't the end all be-all. Rob doesn't want to be Robert, then he isn't fucking Robert. If Suzie Marie Jones wants to be Marie, then she's Marie. \"What I name you is your name\" is some self expression stifling bullshit", "> but of course it can be done later, as in your situation.\n\nIt was not done later. It was literally done 2 days post-birth.", "Then they have to keep talking and tossing around ideas.  Just drawing a line in the sand on either side does not bode well for their future.", "We even had problems when we used the same bank.  He thought opening my mail was funny until one day long ago, his paycheck got deposited into my account.  Unlikely to happen today with everything being automated, but I made him sweat a bit before it got corrected.  ROFL", "She has a very specific list already that does not match his.", "He already is familiar with her family names I am.betting and none are on his table..", "This is a different person I'm responding to, not the OP's situation.", "Thanks for that clarification!", "Fine then they can make longer lists.  They don't seem to have spent much time on this.  Both seem to have just decided these few names are what I want and that's it.  There is no way with the millions of names out there that are not some they both like and would be happy with.\n\nAgain, if they can't come to a mutual decision on this, this marriage is doomed.  They are going to have much bigger decisions to make in the future.\n\nThis isn't really even about the names.  It's about how they work together as a team.\n\n\r\"She has a very specific list already that does not match his.\"  Exactly.", "I get that, but I think equal is maybe not actually equitable when it comes to children. Women do all of the work of growing and birthing the children at significant cost and risk to themselves and men often feel entitled to decision making on naming and other things anyway. I wouldn't take this line myself but I respect it as a starting point to level the power dynamic of the discussion. It really depends on a lot of other factors outside of this one issue, but I see how it would be a valid line to draw at the start of the decision making process\n\nETA: the person you're responding to also said that the kids are getting the father's last name and she wanted final say on the other names. If he wanted to have a say on those he could easily put last name back on the table for negotiation and have more say in the other names", "So, he gets the last name AND she has to compromise on the middle name. How is that fair? \n\nShe wants a middle name that reflects her family. That is not an unreasonable request.", "A longer list just means the name.will be totally his..", "> Women do all of the work of growing and birthing the children at significant cost and risk to themselves and men often feel entitled to decision making on naming and other things anyway\n\nSure, let's further exclude fathers from their children. That won't breed any resentment at all, no way, no how. \n\nOr you can be functional adults and compromise on your child's name. A father demanding full control over naming is an ass, but that doesn't make a mother demanding full control over naming any better.\n\n>the person you're responding to also said that the kids are getting the father's last name and she wanted final say on the other names.\n\nShe also got to give them family names as their middle name from her side of the family, which makes absolute sense. At which point, the first name can be a name they *both agree with*.", "He actually did say that. You may want to reread the post.", "They agreed TOGETHER to the last name.  If she wants to go back and renegotiate that, have at it.  They didn't agree to the last name with the understanding that the other names would be decided by only one of them.  They need to COOPERATE.  If it's going to be tit for tat and a constant battle over what's \"fair,\" this marriage is doomed.", "The father was not being excluded, he got the last name. He also got to have children grown for him in someone else's body without having to bear any of the physical costs himself, some of which are lifelong. Nor did he have to risk his life in the process. It's not about excluding men, it's about introducing equity to the decision making process that has historically been male dominated. If he wants to choose the other names, he has to be equally flexible on the last name. Can't have it both ways. \n\nLast names are more important than middle names so he got the most important name, she gets the other. Children can have multiple middle names, the equitable answer would be to both have full choice over a middle name each and one gets the first name while the other gets the last. Yes, agreement on all names is ideal but if you have to split control it needs to be equitable for both people", "Nowhere does it say he told her she had no say in what the kid's name would be. All he did was rejecting her idea/desire for a middle name in an insensitive and very stupid manner. That's not the same thing at all.", "Yea, she obviously agreed under the impression that she would get the middle name. Now, she isn\u2019t, she needs to reconsider the last name. \n\nYour definition of cooperating is being a doormat. There\u2019s no point being a doormat just to keep the peace.", "This marriage is already doomed just read how the husband is...", "Nowhere does it say she had any impression at that point about the middle name.  My idea is that they sit down and cooperate together to come up with a solution they can both can live with.\n\nIf that's being a doormat, so be it.\n\nI have never understood why people jump to the most extreme interpretation of what people say on here.\n\nYou are right, they should not even try to keep the peace.  Let them fight about it and stew about it for the next 20 years.  That'll show em.\n\nWhat an advertisement for marriage.", "He's the asshole.\n\nNTA", "My son has his mother's last name as one of his middles and I have my mother's as a middle it is a tradition started by my mom", "NTA", "If the names don't matter, why is he so adamant about it?\n\nNTA, but really why didn't you two discuss this before deciding to have kids?\n\nYou've not given ages, but I'm guessing you're pretty young and he is controlling in general, right?", "NTA.

Except she did actually name my brother Patrick and gets pissed off when people refer to him as Pat.", "My brother got my mother's maiden name, and he even gave his son the same middle name. It's sort of like being a junior, but instead of being named after a person, they're named after an entire family. Which is basically the description of a surname as well. \n\nThat said, I think she should name the kid Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez. Because reasons.", "That\u2019s funny. I specifically gave my kids names that had multiple nicknames because I have a name that can\u2019t be shortened in any logical way and I have always hated that.", "I had a friend named Patrick. His mother wanted a Rick but didn't like Richard. No one every called him Pat or Patrick.", "Great.  They can just divorce.", "Great.  They should just divorce now.", "NTA at all. My siblings and I all have middle names that were passed down from my moms family. It\u2019s so sweet and makes me feel connected to them. \n\nNot sure why your husband is being an invalidating jerk, though.", "NTA. I feel the exact same way. Currently pregnant. Getting his last name, my middle name, and a first name not from either family. If he can't be bothered to make a middle name compromise, that's pretty low. Hold your ground.", "NTA I have my mums last name as a second middle name and think that is a somewhat common thing to do. We did the same with our son and put my boyfriend\u2019s last name as his second middle name since we gave him my last name.", "NTA. Names matter. They get his last name, so it is completely reasonable to use a name from your family for a middle name.
