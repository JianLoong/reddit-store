You have to carry and brith them and he acts like that is some how an advantage? \n\n\nHe also laughs at a serious suggestion of yours? \n\n\n\nREALLY not great behaviour.", "NTA. This is a negotiation. Put the last name back on the table as in tell him you now want a double barreled last name, or just your name.

Naming your child is a shared decision, but your husband laughing it off or making childish jokes about it is infuriating. I\u2019d sit him down and have a frank discussion about not only the importance of the name, but also how hurtful his responses are.", "NTA.\n\nAnd if it matters to you, it matters. And if he really thought it didn't matter he wouldn't have a problem with it.", "NTA. That\u2019s cruel of him to laugh off the suggestion. Naming requires two yesses, so I don\u2019t think he is obligated to agree to a name if your choice, but he\u2019s an asshole for not even being open minded.", "NTA. That was such an off handed comment from him. Just because it doesn't matter to him he shouldn't ignore that it matters to you.", "If names don't matter, then your husband shouldn't object to choosing names from your family.
