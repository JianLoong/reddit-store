I'm kind of annoyed while typing this.\n\nI was invited to my friend's birthday party a few days ago and today, 2 days before the party, I found out that her initial plans of drinking together in a field had completely changed to going to someone\u2019s house who I\u2019ve never met. She also requested everyone bring a bottle of alcohol since she couldn\u2019t afford to supply all 16 people (one of which is someone\u2019s dad??) she invited with enough.\n\nI was already uncomfortable as I only know 5 or 6 people she has invited. I cancelled and said I was no longer comfortable going as soon as I found out about this extra stuff and was immediately met with 3 of my friends and one other girl arguing with me over snapchat.\n\nOne of my friends told me I shouldn\u2019t be scared to go and I should put myself out there more after I told her the idea of being drunk and vulnerable in front of strangers made me anxious. Another girl I\u2019m not friends with said that they would have to find more alcohol to replace what I would\u2019ve bought and when I said to her I wouldn\u2019t have brought anything with me anyways she got even angrier as she said I wasn\u2019t an exception to the request to bring alcohol.

First, don't let anyone else pressure you into making a decesion you are not comfortable with, because you, not them, have to deal with (or enjoy depending on the issue at hand) the consequences. \n\nWhen you make decisions, it's often not about a black or white 'moral' like 'is drinking OK' but about risk factors in the situation.  Having some drinks in the basement of your house just you and one close friend, pretty low risk and if something goes wrong the extent of the bad will probably be throwing up and being sick. Having drinks with a bunch of people you don't know on the other hand, in a place you don't have an easy way out, much higher risk. The bad could be rape, a car wreck, being sick, etc.  What is comes down to is...Don't make any bets you aren't willing to lose.  There are no 'do overs' in life is something bad happens.\n\nOne of the things that used to make me mad in high school was when I'd go to a party or a small get together and people would drink or smoke pot, fine, they were people I knew and the location was close to my house and I had my own car to leave on my own so it was pretty low risk.  But...they would almost always then want to leave and drive to a different location.  I could never understand why.  We are all here having a good time why do they want to leave and get in a car to drive after drinking? So I remember one time this happened my best friend stayed with me, everyone else left, and me and my friend just sat on the front porch until it was safe to drive home.   I didn't hang out with them much after that.  people just make stupid decisions, but you don't have to.  \n\nAlso, another tidbit that has helped me much through my life is \"no one else has to agree or believe you are right for you to ACTUALLY BE RIGHT\" Don't spend energy trying to convince anyone you are right about this, it doesn't change the fact that you ARE right if no one else knows it.\n\nLastly, I found it worked much better, expecially at your age, to just blame not participating in something I felt unsafe about was to just blame it on something else, like my parent's wouldn't let me go, or wait until the day of and say you are throwing up sick, or that you are being forced to go visit your sick uncle, something like that.  It avoids the 'convincing on social media' issue.  Although I didn't have internet when I was your age, so for you I would remind you NOT to post anything contrary to what you told them during the time of the party, like don't post a picture of you at a park if you said you were sick.\n\nTry to find one good friend that shares your comfort level and build your relationship with that person or a very small group of like minded friends.  The big groups of friends are much harder to deal with and much less satisying in the long run.  One good BFF is better than 20 social party friends.", "NTA Learning to ignore peer pressure and do what is right for you is just part of growing up.", "NTA.
