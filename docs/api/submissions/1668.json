At this point, James didn't want to turn this into an argument, so he walked off.\n\nAlthough James was still annoyed, he asked me and Alex to get a photo with him and Layla. We both agreed. Layla asked Alex to take his headphones off, but he refused; the guests were still too loud. Layla got upset, asking again for him to take his headphones off just for a few minutes. He said no again, and added if he took them off he wouldn't be able to focus on the camera. I asked Layla why he couldn't wear his headphones, and she said it would ruin the aesthetic of the photos. Alex told us he would just sit out on the photos and Layla and James agreed that'd be best. \n\nI told Layla it was either both of us or neither of us, so she shrugged and said it'd be better if I wasn't in the photos anyway, so I walked away from them.

Your fianc\u00e9e has special needs and they ridiculed that.", "NTA. you should take EVERYTHING she said personally. she and your cousin sound ableist and willfully ignorant. she\u2019s not even blood, who the hell does she think she is to speak about you and your fianc\u00e9 that way, let alone speak that way AT ALL.", "So NTA. You stood up for your family and should be proud of yourself. Not questioning if you did something wrong.

Maybe could have been handled without the name calling. Might have carried more weight as a more this is what you did wrong and how it is discriminatory behavior.

Also, one would think that the bride and groom would have other things to focus on, especially during the ceremony. \n\nBut there\u2019s no reason to have been publicly nasty to them at the reception.  Not because it\u2019s their special day necessarily, but because it is a family gathering and others are affected as well, and your message was lost.

Not only are headphones a reasonable accommodation, but even without getting it they shouldn't be throwing slurs around. If they wanted a photo with him without the headphones, they could find somewhere quiet.", "I'm going to go with NTA.  However, I don't think calling them out like that was necessary.  But I understand why you did.", "NTA for helping him deal with his issues - but you need to consider some noise cancelling ear buds - I have some - they are brilliant, and very discreet - they fit inside the ear, and they come flesh coloured - barely noticeable.  \n\nI get they insulted your partner first, but try not to descend to other peoples level.  Mocking someones disability is always low.", "I agree with what someone else said. Could you not have got ear plugs and used them for the photos? Big headphones would be kinda odd in an official wedding photo he could have used the ear plugs just for a couple minutes. Just a bit of preplanning could have solved it. They\u2019re still assholes for calling him the R word.", "YTA!", "ESH, headphones for a wedding is a bit rude, one day he could of worn earplugs its not an everyday thing... but then n t a for leaving amd calling them out in front of family but I do understand where they were coming from.", "Nothing wrong with that, per se.  My wife and I have an 8 year difference between us.", "If a person can't show another person basic respect, then they don't deserve respect. Period.\n \nWhat OP did was not even disrespectful, just speaking the truth of the matter\n \nNTA OP\n \nAs someone with an autistic partner. Thank you for being a good partner \u2764\ufe0f", "Most people dealing with disabilities already work out what works best for them. It's not disrespectful for him to take care of himself. OP is NTA.", "Earplugs aren't a solution for many autistic people; sensory issues are more than just sound", "Honestly headphones really are disrespectful at a wedding. I don\u2019t see any excuse for it seeing as he\u2019s lived with this his entire life so for me it\u2019s closer to NAH. Earplugs are such an easy solution that won\u2019t draw instant attention. No excuse not to bring some for a wedding rather than headphones when you know noise will be a problem. I\u2019d also be curious what kind of headphones he was wearing. If it was something bulky like Beats or along those lines than frankly I consider op and her man the assholes in the situation.", "Earplugs are a sensory nightmare, often don\u2019t work at all, and never is it disrespectful for a person with a disability to use something that helps with their disability. It\u2019s not like he was listening to his own music, nor are the type of headphones used to dull sounds at all similar in look to the ones that play music.", "I feel like you're allowed to be publicly nasty to anyone who throws the R word at your partner \ud83e\udd37", "The headphones are fine. They work for him, and anyone around him that doesn\u2019t get it can get it cleared up with a quick conversation. And if they\u2019re unsympathetic afterwards, that\u2019s on them.\n\nNot wanting them in the photos is also reasonable if he doesn\u2019t wear them all the time.  You want a picture of the guy you know as you know him, not wearing accommodations to remind you that he is currently more uncomfortable at your wedding than you\u2019ve ever seen him be in the past. \n\nBut the solution to that is an easy \u201clet\u2019s take this later\u201d or \u201clet\u2019s take this somewhere quieter\u201d, both opinions every adult involved had the option of proposing. Worst case scenario, the wedding couple gives up, takes a perfunctory photo, and let\u2019s the photographer know later that he can just cut it.\n\nLiterally nobody had to dig in their heels and then escalate a conflict here, as there\u2019s some pretty easy fixes available, but everyone did anyway.", "\"Your fiance should make his disability less conspicuous to those around him so that they aren't assholes to him\" \n\nIs that really what you want so say here?", "I cannot see at a wedding without my glasses. Should I just avoid going to them?", "You're right. People who are incredibly sensitive to noise should just stay home and never leave the house. They should never be welcomed into public events, and if they do venture into public by mistake, they should just deal with the noise and get over themselves.  \n\nHow dare someone wear headphones, use a cane, wear hearing aids, use a wheelchair, or anything else that might interfere with this couple's wedding photos!!!\n\n/s (because I feel like you're stupid enough to not understand sarcasm)", "He was literally fine with the headphones on??? So him being autistic means he shouldn\u2019t go out in public? Lmao", "That's what the headphones were for. He was fine with the headphones. \n\nMaybe you'd like him to live in a home where no one has to ever see his headphones, which are apparently incredibly offensive to some people *for no good reason.*", "\"If someone needs minor accommodations, you should leave them at home. Like a pet.\" -you, apparently.", "How do you feel about crutches? Casts? Hearing aids?", "Noise canceling headphones are completely different from using ear plugs.  If he needed a wheelchair to live his life, would that be inappropriate? Because NC headphones are a very common piece of adaptive equipment that people who are autistic use. It's no different than anything else people use to live their lives to the fullest they can.\n\n*ETA  many autistics have physical sensory issues. So jamming something in their ear probably wouldn't work", "Are my glasses inappropriate for a wedding? Are wheelchairs?", "As someone with a younger sibling with autism I just want to educate. Most ear plugs barley do anything to block out the noises that people are sensitive too and are intended to protect your ear drums from potentially dangerous levels of sound, where the headphones are usually noise canceling or noise reduction for the intended purpose of putting noise levels to a point where they can focus, aren\u2019t being overstimulated, and hopefully prevent a meltdown due to be overwhelmed by their sense of sound", "He's tried earplugs before, but he said they were too uncomfortable and they always felt like slipping out, so he prefers headphones. I should also add that Alex talked to James and Layla before the wedding and told them about the headphones, and they both said it was fine.", "She's a new adult and he's lived 50% more life than her. At 20, that's a big deal. And how old was she when they started dating?", "The bride & groom might deserve it but the rest of the family does not.  And again, their message is lost because of the delivery.", "If someone normally wears contacts, but ends up wearing glasses to a wedding should they be required to take off the glasses for pictures so they look like their regular self?", "That's what it sounds like.", "Most, yes, but there are options that don't look so much like headphones. I understand if a person if severe enough that they like only one type of headpine and anything else causes a meltdown, but OP doesn't indicate that is specifically the issue. \n\nIf they boyfriend can manage with something less headphone-looking, then he should for occasions like this", "The rest of the family deserves to know exactly how this pretentious couple feels about a people who require simple special accommodations.", "Why does it bother you so much that someone wears headphones? Does it bother you if they wear thick glasses too? How about a cast, or a wheelchair?  Those most horrify you!", "So he should make sure his much-needed disability accommodations look pretty for the pictures? Should someone stop using their walker and stumble a few steps to keep that unsightly device out of the photos? Should someone blind keep their white cane out of the shot? After all, this is such an important occasion, it wouldn't do for people to be reminded of -ew- *disabilities.*", "No, I am saying if there are other options that work, then use them. I asked a question and I didn't mention looking good for pictures.\n\nIf there are no other options, I have no problem w/ the headphones, however, if there are other options, OP's boyfriend should use them for these types of occasions.\n\nDid I put in a judgment? No. I asked. You can't answer if no other options work for OP's boyfriend b/c you aren't him and you don't know what he has tried."]}
