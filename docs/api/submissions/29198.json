We have had a pretty strained relationship since my mom left him and got remarried.. \n\nMy dad and I argued constantly argued.As On my two days off I would go out and spend time with my boyfriend. Im a full time college student and have a full time job. ive never been wild child. We would argue about me not being home often. he wasnt either because he worked out of town.\n\nFast forward to about 5 months ago our arguments started turning into how he was upset that I would go spend time with my mother once or twice a week or spend the night there. she has custody of my little sister and recently had a baby with her husband so the only time I got to see them is when i would go over there. He hated my mother for leaving him and said I was being disloyal to him by actively trying to be around her and her new husband. \n\nat the beginning of August he took the car he gave me for graduation to prevent me from going to my moms. This caused me to miss some college classes almost resulting in me getting dropped from classes, missing some work which luckily my bosses were like family so they understood and helped me get rides. And i was told to figure out how I was going to get around, luckily my boyfriends mom allowed me to use her car. Shortly after this i was at my moms and he was out town, and he called me absolutely losing his mind that i had been at my moms (he had me on life 360) and told me to get my shit and figure it out. \n\nIn a lot of our arguments he has said this to me and i would constantly beg him to reconsider but this time i was done, i replied ok and hung up. i asked my mom if i could move in woth her to which she said i could and called my boyfriend to help me move out and that same night i started packing my things. \n\nWithin 3 days i was out. A couple weeks went by and i remembered my name was on the utilities.I got ahold of his girlfriend and let her know i would be taking my name off but tell the companies to leave them on a week in order to give them time to get it in their name so they didnt go without power or water. When i did this he called my mother absolutely losing his mind calling me vindictive and saying i was only doing this to get back at him. He also stated i better give him any deposits i get back from them, i told him i wouldnt be doing that as i paid the initial deposits when he couldnt and he never gave me the money back for them so i would be keeping the leftover. \n\nNow to the initial point of the post, some of my family think im being childish and petty for not trying to work things out with him and better our relationship. they think i should be the bigger person and apologize for taking my name off the utilities and try to reconcile.

He pushed you too far and now is reaping what he sewed.  It is wrong of him to be mad at you for continuing a relationship with your mother regardless of how he feels, she is YOUR mother.  Good luck", "NTA.  I would go NC with him.  He is absolutely abusive and I can understand why your mother left him.", "NTA  Your father sounds like a jealous, controlling bully.  He and your mom are the ones that got divorced, not you and your mom.  It is unfair of him to punish you because of his unreasonable hatred of her.  If this behavior has been going on for a long time it is a good thing you are out of there.  Getting your name off of the utilities at his house was a smart move.  Your father has issues you cannot fix and as long as he continues this pattern of behavior you are better off going no contact.  The family members that are inserting themselves into this situation need to butt out.  They are not the ones being bullied.  You have not done anything wrong.", "NTA\n\nWhy would you want to be the bigger person and reconcile with someone who punishes you and tries to ruin your life because his attempts at parental alienation aren't working and throws a temper tantrum when he cant control you? There's nothing worth reconciling or recovering here, and your father isn't likely to ever change. Going fully NC and cutting off utilities in your name and other things that connect you to him are the better options. Ignore everyone else, being the 'bigger person' will just ensure that he continues to act this way and there's nothing worthwhile in a relationship like that.", "NTA your dad is taking his problems out on you. let it wash over and enjoy living with your mum. he sounds a bit narcissitic", "NTA\n\nYour Dad is behaving like a spoilt child. He has done nothing but make you unhappy and make your life difficult by taking your car etc\n\nKeep your deposits and definitly dont apologise.", "NTA, he's trying to use you to punish your mother in the way he wants to do. That is absolutely not ok and hugely immature for a 45-year-old. You are being very generous to leave the utilities on for a week to allow them to switch over, as you are on the hook for the usage charges ran up during that time.\n\nHe's the one that needs to work on bettering your relationship, not you. You have **ABSOLUTELY** nothing to apologize for, but he does.", "He\u2019s a toxic person, and you can\u2019t fix that. You may just need to be done with him. It\u2019s tough, I am estranged from a narcissistic sister, but we\u2019ve all got to separate ourselves from that kind of negativity. Life has enough drama without intentionally adding to it.   \n\n\nPS: Apropos of nothing, I wonder how your dad\u2019s GF feels about his rather transparent obsession with your mom? Geez. Some people are only capable of dysfunction.", "I get why he would feel betrayed. But it wasn't you who betrayed him and he needs to get his shit together. \n\nYou still have two parents, he didn't magically pop you into existence. You also have younger siblings, he needs to accept that you are not going to stop spending time with them. \n\nWhat happened between your Mother and Father is just that- between them and it doesn't include you and your siblings. \n\nVindictive? You mean like taking a car away? He is fortunate that you gave them warning that your name would be coming off the utilities. Ending services when you move house is normal behaviour, so I don't see your Father's point. Did he expect to live there with your name on utilities when you don't live there? Why should you apologise for doing the normal thing and alert utilities that you moved?? \n\nAs for the family that says you should be the bigger person, I'd say thank you for your opinion, bye *dumps opinion in commercial shredder* \n\nNTA", "NTA and I'd go NC with him.", "Why should you be the bigger person to your parent, who's literally and metaphorically bigger?\n\nAlso, your father sounds insufferable.

NTA, sounds like you'll be better off without him.", "NTA. Your father is the AH in this situation. He has no right to interfere with your relationship with your mother. Sounds like she had a good reason for leaving him. Was the var he gave you in your name or his? If it\u2019s in your name he can\u2019t keep it from you, even if he paid for it. Ask the police to accompany you to go pick it up. If it\u2019s in his name, there is nothing you can do, make sure you cancel the insurance if that was in your name. Don\u2019t forget to offer to pay rent or help your mom in exchange for a place to live.", "First of all, you are 20 years old, a full-time college student with a full-time job.  Wow!  Second, you have made the effort to maintain a relationship with your littles and your mom.  Third, you have maintained a relationship with your dad and even *put utilities in your name* (why?). Fourth, it sounds like dad has a girlfriend (we all hope she is an adult) who can be contributing, if she lives at his house.  And, fifth, you had the gumption to leave that abusive household.  Kudos!!  *Applause*\n\nBeyond the verbal and emotional abuse, you lost wages and are going to lose your deposits on your college classes because *your father took away the car he gifted you*.  (Controlling prick move. Is the car in his name?  Do you pay insurance (if so, cancel it and ask the remainder be sent to your new address?).  Put in an address change at the postal service and everywhere you can think has it - work, school, IRS, anything.  Turn off the utilities.  Then take a break and block everything so you can get some breathing room and some adjusting time.  Get back on track with school and work.  Figure out transportation.  Figure out how to integrate into the new household without taking advantage or being taken advantage of. \n\nBe gentle on yourself.  This is a huge adjustment but it will be worth it.  I hope we get a positive update sometime, OP.\n\nEDIT:  NTA", "NTA and your dad is taking out his anger at your mom on you, all these years later which is such BS. Finish school and live your life. You did the nice thing by giving them a heads up on the utilities (which I don't see why would be in your name anyways) and he still found a way to shit on you for it. He's toxic, steer clear and maybe someday he'll figure himself out. Or not, but at least you won't be the butt of his abuse.  And those family members giving you grief about not reconciling can go live with him instead.  Don't give your energy to people who treat you bad. Life's too short for that.", "NTA. He asked for it.", "Nope ..NTA. He is toxic if not narasstic. Don't worry about it. Leave him in the past. He belongs there. And as someone who has left a toxic narasstic parent behind... believe me when I tell you it's the best thing ever.", "NTA. Every bit of this is his fault, I can see why your mother left him.", "NTA, your dad sounds insane. He needs therapy and is taking out all his hurt and anger on you. You do not deserve that, and you are free to not have to deal with him anymore. I think space would do wonders for you", "Your father doesn't have a chip on his shoulder. He has a boulder.
