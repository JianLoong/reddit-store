She says leave you leave, she says sit you sit or it's \"you're not prioritizing me\" .\n\n If you enjoy your job like what you do then do it someone who loves you would always be supportive especially when you're not doing anything wrong.\n\nShe seems very insecure either talk to her and sort it out or leave cause in the long run it just might get worse where she asks your colleagues about you or shows up at your work to check on you creating unnecessary drama in the office", "NTA. Keep choosing yourself.  She\u2019s nuts.", "1) This is toxic behavior, regardless of whether the job is involved. 50% of the population is female\u2014you\u2019re going to interact with them on occasion.

Often those who throw accusations are the ones who are behaving that way themselves. Maybe say you want to discuss why she\u2019s so worried and is it because she flirts with her male coworkers? And when she\u2019s in a restaurant is she flirting when she\u2019s polite and that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t like it?  \n\nDo not leave your job, this shouldn\u2019t even be a competition.", "NTA. A relationship without trust is doomed to fail.

It happens a lot where a partner is cheating and to reflect blame will start accusations.", "NTA. This is definitely a situation where choosing your job over the gf is the correct decision.", "NTA look there is being insecure then there is this hot mess because she doesn\u2019t even know if you are talking to other girls just that you might be.

She is also being very possessive and accusatory. Her saying if you love me you\u2019d leave your job is also manipulative. She\u2019s a whole host of red flags. You\u2019d be better off breaking up with her as in the long run this has a chance of significantly negatively impacting you.", "NTA.\n\nRun. She is manipulative and emotionally abusive.", "NTA\n\nActually quite the opposite, you sound like a civil and likeable guy who is sadly dating someone with rather severe insecurities that she's projecting into you. Maybe given time she'll grow out of them, but it isn't on you to coddle or enable them. You **talking** with women in a professional environment is not the least bit suspect, and random accusations of cheating are not a good look for your girlfriend.\n\nAlso this...\n\n>She said if she was rlly my priority I would do it. I said no because I just got promoted, leaving in the middle of the day would most definitely be frowned upon. She\u2019s now saying that I\u2019m choosing my job over her and that she knows where we stand now. \n\nIs another form of toxic behaviour.\n\nA healthy relationship should pretty much never have someone say to you something to the effect of, \"if you really loved me you would...\" insert some form of self-destructive behaviour such as sabotaging your job. This is not healthy behaviour on her part, and her guilt tripping you over it is just compounding manipulation with more manipulation.", "NTA.  She's displaying a pattern of behaviour that will only get worse - do you want that for the rest of your life?", "NTA except to yourself if you stay with her. My husband works in a predominantly female dominated field. Has for over 20 years. I\u2019ve never once expected him to not talk with his coworkers or leave his job. Your girlfriend is an immature, insecure nut job. Run. Get away from her.", "NTA\n\nThis is a crazy, abusive level of control from your gf. It's not normal at all. I really think this is the point that you have to break up because it'll just get worse.", "She sounds really immature. Both to life\u2019s responsibilities and to relationships. Does she have a job? I bet she lives at home and have everything served to her. Not anything wrong with that in it self, since she\u2019s 19, but she doesn\u2019t seem to know anything about responsibility. Her severe insecurity of your dedication to her and her jealousy is not normal or acceptable. If you want to stay with her, you have to talk to her about this and explain why she is unreasonable. It could be a learnt behavior also. Like she believes that\u2019s how you are supposed to behave when you\u2019re in love, otherwise you do not care enough. Well she is young and may eventually learn what life is about and shape up, but she may need a few relationships to get there, sorry.", "YTA.

Be careful, OP!", "OP - NTA, but seriously look at those Red Flags flapping away in the breeze that your girlfriend keeps waving!\n\nHer behaviour is not normal at all. She is sabotaging your personal and professional life. How long before she bans you from talking to Granny, Mom, sister\u2026?", "NTA it sounds like she\u2019s insecure and her asking you to leave without a particular reason was a sort of \u2018test\u2019 which you\u2019ve failed in her eyes but really it\u2019s just showing her true colours. If she had an emergency it would have been fair to ask you to leave work but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here. I think you should reassess the relationship, you\u2019ve already left jobs for her? When does this stop?", "NTA \n\nI think a long talk is needed here. Whether its past trauma, insecurities, or something you have indicated to her, she isn't really on the same team as you right now. \n\nSir down, have a long talk, be honest. It'll either iron itself out, or it won't.\n\nGood luck, op, and congrats on the job!", "NTA. Keep the great job, ditch the asshole girlfriend.

My man leave her. You're still young, obviously job comes first.", "NTA get out of there as soon as possible. I know it feels hard because you obviously care a lot about this person, but this is not a healthy relationship for either of you. Your girlfriend has made you feel like you've had to change jobs multiple times because she was uncomfortable. She seems very insecure of you paying attention to other girls, which is not your problem. Would you honestly be okay with your friends girlfriend tell your friend to up and leave their job in the middle of a shift just because she doesn't like the job? If no, then why should you be okay with it happening to you? The fact that your girlfriend says that this means you prioritise your job over her is also very concerning. It sounds like she wants to have the majority of your attention and have an amount of influence in your life that doesn't really sound healthy.", "NTA at all. You haven't done anything wrong or anything to warrant her distrust. What you are seeing is her insecurities coming out in full force, and since she probably doesn't know how to handle that, she's dumping it all over you. You don't deserve it at all. \n\nIf you want to try and keep this relationship you need to sit her down and talk to her about her behavior and her (unearned) lack of trust in you. Just remember that not everything works out the way we want it to.", "NTA never leave a good job for a partner, good jobs are hard to find. Dump her controlling jealous ass.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is controlling and manipulative. I would never leave work or leave a job because my partner demanded me to for shits and giggles. It\u2019s never going to end and she will keep asking you to give up more and more", "Also, people who are baselessly distrustful of others like your GF often turn out to be either guilty of that behavior themselves, or want to engage in that behavior. The accusation is often a confession.\n\nBut you're young. You have your whole life in front of you. Don't waste it on someone manipulative and controlling.\n\nYou can do better.", "This. If OP's girlfriend can't trust him now, it will not get any better I'm the future\n.", "This. \n\nI wonder what she would feel like if it was OP telling her leave work in the middle of the day and all that. \n\nBeing stuck at work most of the day etc sucks sure.
