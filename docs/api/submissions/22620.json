Ever since I started, she\u2019s accused me of being \u201cfriendly\u201d with other girls in my department or cheating on her. I literally do not do anything like that. I very much keep to myself and only speak when spoken to in most situations. \n\nEarlier today, she randomly told me to just leave work in the middle of my shift.

Sudden, unsubstantiated accusations of cheating and insistence that the other partner prove their love are common symptoms of someone trying to sabotage a relationship, either consciously or unconsciously.  I would suggest sitting down and talking to her, telling her that she seems unhappy lately and you'd like to talk about it.   Be firm in your boundaries--you are not cheating, but you also won't be doing things that might get you in trouble at work to 'prove' your dedication.  You love her, but you won't put up with her using her insecurities to attack you.   If she wants more time with you, then you will schedule it around work.

I'm not saying to break up with her instantly, but if she's not willing to sit down and deal with her issues or talk about them honestly, you don't need her in your life.

It doesn\u2019t seem like you\u2019re getting much out of that relationship. How long are you willing to put up with her toxic behavior? She\u2019s waving every red flag in your face. IMO end the relationship and focus on yourself. Don\u2019t let her get in the way of your success.", "NTA. This is manipulation. \n\nYou can't dance to her tune. She says leave you leave, she says sit you sit or it's \"you're not prioritizing me\" .\n\n If you enjoy your job like what you do then do it someone who loves you would always be supportive especially when you're not doing anything wrong.\n\nShe seems very insecure either talk to her and sort it out or leave cause in the long run it just might get worse where she asks your colleagues about you or shows up at your work to check on you creating unnecessary drama in the office", "NTA. Keep choosing yourself.  She\u2019s nuts.", "1) This is toxic behavior, regardless of whether the job is involved. 50% of the population is female\u2014you\u2019re going to interact with them on occasion. And that doesn\u2019t mean you are cheating or planning to cheat. \n\n2) I love my family, but short of one of them going to the hospital, I would never just walk out. This is a tough economy. If you have a good job, you hold onto it. \n\nI think you should re-evaluate this relationship.", "you ready to forever bounce around jobs? it doesnt look great on paper", "Nta, it's your job. Unless it's an absolute emergency, then there's no reason to leave in the middle of the day. Her insecurities aren't your fault, and she seems a bit controlling. It will only get worse.", "NTA - dont leave your jobs leave your gf she is totally has trust issues which are her issue not yours. she sabotages your job and makes baseless accusations becuase your polite and say please and thank you.  what more do you need to move on from her?  she wins for the most insecure and controlling gf of the week on reddit", "NTA and also get out of there right now dude. She\u2019s jealous and controlling, and this will get worse.", "NTA, so you\u2019ve already left two other jobs and she\u2019s still not satisfied with you. \n\nI\u2019d be tempted to call her bluff and say, leave then, if you\u2019re going to disrespect me by making me chose between making a living and you, then you obviously aren\u2019t the person I know. \n\nAlso I\u2019d be wondering is she deflecting? Often those who throw accusations are the ones who are behaving that way themselves. Maybe say you want to discuss why she\u2019s so worried and is it because she flirts with her male coworkers? And when she\u2019s in a restaurant is she flirting when she\u2019s polite and that\u2019s why she doesn\u2019t like it?  \n\nDo not leave your job, this shouldn\u2019t even be a competition.", "NTA. A relationship without trust is doomed to fail. If you can\u2019t trust your partner you shouldn\u2019t be with them.", "Sounds like she needs to do some growing up before she\u2019s in a serious relationship where both parties work and pay bills", "NTA, also, if she is accusing you of cheating all the time, perhaps she has guilt of her own and she has been unfaithful. It happens a lot where a partner is cheating and to reflect blame will start accusations.", "NTA. This is definitely a situation where choosing your job over the gf is the correct decision.", "NTA look there is being insecure then there is this hot mess because she doesn\u2019t even know if you are talking to other girls just that you might be. How dare another female be in the vicinity of you on the work place and you use manners and human decency towards other people?", "Uhm\u2026 you meant ex-girlfriend.\n\nNTA", "NTA, don\u2019t run, get in a fkn car a GO GO GO", "NTA- she sounds controlling and abusive.", "NTA. She is also being very possessive and accusatory. Her saying if you love me you\u2019d leave your job is also manipulative. She\u2019s a whole host of red flags. You\u2019d be better off breaking up with her as in the long run this has a chance of significantly negatively impacting you.", "NTA.\n\nRun. She is manipulative and emotionally abusive.", "NTA\n\nActually quite the opposite, you sound like a civil and likeable guy who is sadly dating someone with rather severe insecurities that she's projecting into you. Maybe given time she'll grow out of them, but it isn't on you to coddle or enable them. You **talking** with women in a professional environment is not the least bit suspect, and random accusations of cheating are not a good look for your girlfriend.\n\nAlso this...\n\n>She said if she was rlly my priority I would do it. I said no because I just got promoted, leaving in the middle of the day would most definitely be frowned upon. She\u2019s now saying that I\u2019m choosing my job over her and that she knows where we stand now. \n\nIs another form of toxic behaviour.\n\nA healthy relationship should pretty much never have someone say to you something to the effect of, \"if you really loved me you would...\" insert some form of self-destructive behaviour such as sabotaging your job. This is not healthy behaviour on her part, and her guilt tripping you over it is just compounding manipulation with more manipulation.", "NTA.  She's displaying a pattern of behaviour that will only get worse - do you want that for the rest of your life?", "NTA except to yourself if you stay with her. My husband works in a predominantly female dominated field. Has for over 20 years. I\u2019ve never once expected him to not talk with his coworkers or leave his job. Your girlfriend is an immature, insecure nut job. Run. Get away from her.", "NTA\n\nThis is a crazy, abusive level of control from your gf. It's not normal at all. I really think this is the point that you have to break up because it'll just get worse.", "She sounds really immature. Both to life\u2019s responsibilities and to relationships. Does she have a job? I bet she lives at home and have everything served to her. Not anything wrong with that in it self, since she\u2019s 19, but she doesn\u2019t seem to know anything about responsibility. Her severe insecurity of your dedication to her and her jealousy is not normal or acceptable. If you want to stay with her, you have to talk to her about this and explain why she is unreasonable. It could be a learnt behavior also. Like she believes that\u2019s how you are supposed to behave when you\u2019re in love, otherwise you do not care enough. Well she is young and may eventually learn what life is about and shape up, but she may need a few relationships to get there, sorry.", "YTA. If u ain\u2019t treating her right, she getting to the point where she needs to test you. As a man, you need to make her feel secure, alpha shit.", "YTA ESH", "NTA. Next thing you know she'll be requesting access to your phone to read your messages. And if you decline it will obviously mean you're cheating on her. Be careful, OP!", "OP - NTA, but seriously look at those Red Flags flapping away in the breeze that your girlfriend keeps waving!\n\nHer behaviour is not normal at all. She is sabotaging your personal and professional life. How long before she bans you from talking to Granny, Mom, sister\u2026?", "NTA it sounds like she\u2019s insecure and her asking you to leave without a particular reason was a sort of \u2018test\u2019 which you\u2019ve failed in her eyes but really it\u2019s just showing her true colours. If she had an emergency it would have been fair to ask you to leave work but that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case here. I think you should reassess the relationship, you\u2019ve already left jobs for her? When does this stop?", "NTA \n\nI think a long talk is needed here. Whether its past trauma, insecurities, or something you have indicated to her, she isn't really on the same team as you right now. \n\nSir down, have a long talk, be honest. It'll either iron itself out, or it won't.\n\nGood luck, op, and congrats on the job!", "NTA. Keep the great job, ditch the asshole girlfriend. She gets mad and accuses you of cheating because you treat other women with respect. That is seriously twisted and will only get worse. Save yourself the pain.", "NTA  \nDude, your girlfriend is a psycho. I'd be dipping in the middle of the night with my things and prepping an avo.", "NTA\n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 \nShe wants you to leave your work in the middle of the day just to prove she's still important. My man leave her. You're still young, obviously job comes first.", "NTA get out of there as soon as possible. I know it feels hard because you obviously care a lot about this person, but this is not a healthy relationship for either of you. Your girlfriend has made you feel like you've had to change jobs multiple times because she was uncomfortable. She seems very insecure of you paying attention to other girls, which is not your problem. Would you honestly be okay with your friends girlfriend tell your friend to up and leave their job in the middle of a shift just because she doesn't like the job? If no, then why should you be okay with it happening to you? The fact that your girlfriend says that this means you prioritise your job over her is also very concerning. It sounds like she wants to have the majority of your attention and have an amount of influence in your life that doesn't really sound healthy.", "NTA at all. You haven't done anything wrong or anything to warrant her distrust. What you are seeing is her insecurities coming out in full force, and since she probably doesn't know how to handle that, she's dumping it all over you. You don't deserve it at all. \n\nIf you want to try and keep this relationship you need to sit her down and talk to her about her behavior and her (unearned) lack of trust in you. Just remember that not everything works out the way we want it to.", "NTA never leave a good job for a partner, good jobs are hard to find. Dump her controlling jealous ass.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is controlling and manipulative. I would never leave work or leave a job because my partner demanded me to for shits and giggles. It\u2019s never going to end and she will keep asking you to give up more and more", "Also, people who are baselessly distrustful of others like your GF often turn out to be either guilty of that behavior themselves, or want to engage in that behavior. The accusation is often a confession.\n\nBut you're young. You have your whole life in front of you. Don't waste it on someone manipulative and controlling.\n\nYou can do better.", "This. If OP's girlfriend can't trust him now, it will not get any better I'm the future\n.", "This. \n\nI wonder what she would feel like if it was OP telling her leave work in the middle of the day and all that. \n\nBeing stuck at work most of the day etc sucks sure. But that's adult life. We need the money for food, a roof over the head, etc etc.\nThen you plan accordingly how to spend after work hours or days off. \nShe doesn't seem to have grasped that part yet.", "NTA,  and yes run, don't stop. Don't look back. Just run!", "WOAH I MISSED THAT LAST SENTENCE\u2026you\u2019ve left 2 jobs for her already! My dude, I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re a victim. You\u2019re a victim of abuse."]}
