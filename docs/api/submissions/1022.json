We are about 15 minutes from the hospital.  Check in was scheduled for 530 a.m. Unbeknownst to me, my wife let my 23 year old son borrow her car last night. My car is out of state because I moved for work, so while I am here, we only have 1 car. We decided to leave at 5 am because she is obviously anxious,  and doesn't want any added anxiety caused by running late. As 5 am hits, my wife tells me my son isn't home yet from the night before and he has the car. I am immediately infuriated. I swallowed my anger as to not upset my wife, but I was livid. Sh3 tells me he is 15 minutes out. I said to her, I guarantee you he brings the car back with no gas. He rolls up at 520, and I just give him a death stare and get in the car. Sure enough the gas light is on. He said he didn't have time to put gas in the car. I stop and get gas (put about 15 bucks in just to save time), and we get to check in a little late. It ended up not being a big deal. My son Venmo me 25 bucks for gas. I proceeded to text him and tell him it isn't about the gas money, it's about you being a selfish f#*k and not being considerate of your mother's situation by being late. This is who he is and I have had it. He is oblivious to the world around him and the people in it. It makes me sick. This is not how I raised him. He the has the audacity to tell me name calling won't solve anything,  and to get my wife to the hospital safely and stop texting him. I am furious. I have had it with his entitled behavior.

He is 23 years old and that is more than old enough to understand the situation and have some empathy for you and his mom.  Never let him take the car again, he can get a job and buy one for himself.   Then stick to it no matter what.

And I would be dipped if he ever borrowed my car again.", "NTA This is where I wish a justified asshole option was a thing. Because he deserved and needed someone to be an asshole for him to understand the gravity of the situation.", "NTA.  He is 23 and should know better and should have been far more considerate under the circumstances.", "Maybe you shouldn't have called him that but I get it. You are under a lot of stress. His mother had to go ine the hospital for surgery and not only he was late but he doesn't even seem to care. I don't understand how people think that they can have any shitty behavour they like but when they get back similar behavour suddenly they are offended. NTA", "He\u2019s an adult and can handle it.

Time for the 23 year old to grow up, get his own damn  car and move out.  hope your wife is ok.", "Going against the grain here.... NTA. I don't really support name calling but in comparison to your son's apathy, you're not the AH here. Not only is he not respecting the property his parents let him have, he has an attitude about it and has the audacity to be late on a rather critical day. \n\nOP, he's only right about name calling... It won't change anything. But I don't think that makes you an AH. In times like this, especially with the stress of a surgery THAT morning and being up THAT early, you're bound to say some stuff you're not always proud of and in this case, you did speak truth.", "NTA", "Based on your comment I understand why you're so upset. Clearly this is not a one time thing AND I'm assuming that son knew mom had major surgery. He just sounds entitled and spoiled. Sure you didn't handle it the best way, but considering the circumstances NTA at all.", "NTA. Did you overreact? Probably. Is it understandable that you did? Under the circumstances, yes. I\u2019ve read your comments, and your son knew how important this was. I gather from everything you said that this was not an isolated incident, so this was building for a long time.", "NTA. My dad has cancer (although not as severe as breast cancer; that\u2019s horrible to go through, and I\u2019m keeping thoughts of you & your wife in my heart) and even I, at 14, knew it was a big-ass deal. Your son is an ADULT and he was that inconsiderate.\n\nMaybe you didn\u2019t need to call him a selfish fuck, but you are in exactly the extenuating circumstances where I\u2019d call that ok.\n\nI truly hope your wife\u2019s surgery goes well, and please remember to take care of yourself. I was a wreck after seeing my dad get out of surgery, so I can\u2019t imagine what it\u2019ll be like to see your wife. Your feelings throughout this process are valid too.", "NTA. Sounds like this is normal for him, so it's time to have a calm, come to Jesus meeting. He needs to look for an apartment, get his own car and insurance and see if that helps to improve his behavior.  I've had sons who want to borrow the car and come skidding in right when I need to leave with no gas in the car. It happened 3 times, I warned them the first two times and the third time was the last strike. Uber, Lyft and cab companies are all options.", "NTA where's the lie?", "NTA.\n\nHe is right - name calling won't solve anything. So think of a few things that might, and do those things. Is it not using the car at all? Using it but always returning it on time and full tank? paying rent? what are the hallmarks of responsibility you want to see from him, and what are the consequences if he cannot demonstrate? \n\nAnd then let him know! \"Son, I'm sorry for my language the other night. Your behavior while your mother is facing the most frightening thing she's ever experienced was unacceptable and unbelievably irresponsible, but you're right  - name calling won't solve anything. What will solve the problem is you taking more responsibility.\" and then explain what you expect of him and the consequences for not following through", "INFO: she let him borrow the car? Did she tell him to bring it back by a certain time?", "INFO:\n\nWhen your wife let your son borrow her car, did she specify the time it had to be back?", "NTA because he obviously was a selfish fuck. Don't despair, he might improve a little with age, 23 isn't that mature yet.", "NTA. He\u2019s 23 and should know better", "Well, he's right that name calling wont solve anything but you don't paint a pretty picture in general. If your account about his character is accurate, NTA.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nYour son is old enough that this shouldn't be a problem. If he has consistent issues with remembering deadlines and doesn't have an underlying condition (ASD, ND, ADHD) you need hard boundaries set of he's going to keep living with you.\n\nHowever, knowing how he can be with not coming home on time your wife lent him the car, knowing she had an early morning appointment. So I can understand why he may think he didn't do anything wrong. \n\nLetting your stress boil over to the point of calling him a selfish fuck accomplished nothing. The added animosity in the house is not going to be helpful for your wife. \n\nBoundaries moving forward are key.  Either he needs to move out on his own, obtain his own car, or there need to be very strict boundaries about use of your wife's vehicle.", "NTA, sorry that your son is. If he's living with you guys, it's time he fends for himself. When did things start to change, is this recent?", "NTA  I would have called him worse.  Your wife was stressed out.  You were stressed out.  The only person who did not seem to care was your son.", "NTA, but when you feel more rational, sit him down, apologize for calling him names, and set some boundaries around him living with you and borrowing your car.

His behavior was selfish, especially as he knew about what was going on.", "INFO: Did your son know about the 5:30am check in time? \n\nAnyway I'm leaning towards NTA here.", "At first I thought \u201che\u2019s a teen, they are selfish by nature (normally)\u201d\u2026but then I looked back and saw 23. I had my own car at 16, was paying for gas, maintenance, etc by myself. He\u2019s 23. Why doesn\u2019t he have his own car? Does he do anything to contribute at all? I would expect this from my 12 yr old stepson. But absolutely not at 23. \ud83d\ude33\nHe needs a \u201ccome to Jesus moment\u201d and grow up. One of his friends could have picked him up. And if he does this often, he shouldn\u2019t be loaned the car especially before such an important appointment. \n\nNTA", "He seem like a selfish fuck what an asshole. I\u2019m sorry but jezzzz the mouth in that kid is crazy. Tell him good luck with getting a ride to where he needs to go and to but his own car.", "Wellllllll I mean you had every right to be upset with him. You're NTA as far as that goes. I don't agree with cursing him out like that, though. Have you ever had *your* father speak like that to *you*?", "NTA. Your son is a selfish fuck.", "Nta. You shouldn't have to be teaching a 23 yr old basic empathy. A 23 yr old who doesn't have his own car probably doesn't have anything important going on to interfere with his moms surgery. If he doesn't care about the family it is time to explain how he will be removed from it.", "NTA, but the more I read the more it seems like mother and son are the biggest assholes of the story.\n\nBoth parents shoulder the blame for raising an AH adult, but at 23 his is fully responsible for remaining an entitled AH.\n\nYour wife is enabling her son's behavior and thus she is an AH as well. She knows what he is like and knew she had an early appointment, but she did it anyway.\n\nPeople pleasers do not make good parents - sometimes you have to make the hard call.", "ESH. Firstly I want to wish your wife a speedy recovery and I think that will be possible if she has the love and support from her family. A rift between her son and her husband is only going to cause her anxiety which is the last thing she needs right now. So you'd best find a resolution as soon as possible. \n\nYour son is 23 years old, a grown man. Borrowing mommy's car and staying out until dawn shouldn't be in his wheelhouse anymore. Especially not on a Wednesday night. He should have a job, he should have his own car. He should know about his moms surgery ffs. \n\nOn the other hand, children are a product of their environment. You claim not to have raised him like this but that is obviously not true because here you are with a son that you raised who is selfish. But he is right that name calling isn't going to help. Have you considered that you are letting your feelings for your wife's condition boil over and manifest as anger towards your son? Being frustrated about the situation is understandable but what you said to your own child was very unkind.", "(Originally) e s h You\u2019re absolutely right that your son was being a selfish, entitled little shit. But you obviously know you handled the situation poorly, because of the stress you were under. Totally understandable. Is there any chance your son was trying to relieve stress too? If this was not usual behavior for him, I might be inclined to cut him some slack because we all have behaved badly when we\u2019re stressed. Definitely don\u2019t let him borrow the car anymore though. But if this is par for the course for him, it might be time to discuss (*after* she has recovered from surgery) making him move out so he will grow tf up. Because his lack of remorse really is quite shitty.\n\nEdit: changing to NTA", "Did you even bother to ask him why he was late ?", "ESH except your wife. while being late to such an important time, you always have to consider that you still talking to a human being. it might be in the heat of the moment, but you dont have to get down to your sons level just to get your point. Maybe its because you were stressed, but next time, choose your words more wise.\n\nIt does not matter what happened before, if you act like an AH, even if you think the situation justify it, you are an AH. You should always be better than that", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

The most hurtful thing is she gives more considration to her friends then to her family.", "you failed as a father by not being strict with him. mother is to blame as well. coddling your children and letting them do what they want is shitty parenting. he has never learned that his actions have consequences. better later than never for you to start doing your job. kick him out.", "Nope. At some point as an adult it\u2019s on him.", "Accept responsibility by kicking him out. You need to teach him how the world works.", "Does he keep a job?", "You are continuing to drop the ball by allowing him to walk all over you, you want to know who won't let him be an entitled prick? The rest of the world and it's long past time he starts living in it.", "Kicking him out would be over kill. But how long has he been without a car? He\u2019s old enough he should have one. Helping him out if he needs to go to work and maintain an actual job isn\u2019t enabling him. It\u2019ll help him save so he can get a car. Letting him take the car out so he can go out and have fun is enabling him. Just don\u2019t do that. If he doesn\u2019t like it he can move out.", "By cleaning it up, do you mean enabling him to be a leech on society? Yes you created it, so fix it, get help on how to, since who knows how much of a snowflake he is.", ">He the has the audacity to tell me name calling won't solve anything,  and to get my wife to the hospital safely and stop texting him.\n\nHe is blatantly aware that you can't do anything in this specific situation, but for this comment alone, I'd take away whatever parental support I can, just to show him that my word carries meaning. \n\nHe wants to borrow the car? Not until he can show respect to his mother and you.\n\nHe wants to borrow money? Well let's see, what has he done for your wife lately? She's bedridden after major surgery. She could use someone to help around the house, bring in fresh flowers, make her tea etc.\n\nSorry if this sounds petty, but if he expects the perks that come with parental love, he better show a child's love.", "NTA and you shouldn't blame yourself (at least, not entirely as I don't know you and your parenting style.) My parents raised my brother and me, and my brother got into drugs and stupid trouble with the law, and so on. He's also just as clueless and thoughtless as your son is here. He isn't a bad kid, but he does dumb things. Don't blame yourself, and best wishes to you and your wife.", "He can know about it just fine. Be clear when you communicate, even if you think \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to.\u201d", "The wife is already grown up, it's a nonissue.", "My point is that as was stated his wife let the son borrow the car. Is she what he called the son.. or perhaps it was 2 flats he gonna kick and curse at the care? How about an accident his behavior is appalling.  There was no back up plan? I always have someone on standby for surgeries", "Exactly. My abusive older brother never had any consequences when he did things that were bad, he\u2019s now almost 30 and is sending my parents death threats because they won\u2019t send him money.", "[removed]", "\"Your parenting wasn\u2019t the only thing he\u2019s experienced in that time. \"\nThis is something we parents have to remember. At some point this young man needs to read the room.", "He\u2019s 23! I thought this was gonna be that he\u2019s like 17", "Especially these days. Kids are raised in school mainly, they spend so much of their life there. Now they have the internet, social media and just online trash to fill their impressionable minds as well. \n\nI've seen so many rational kids get into some really terrible incel media and just do a 180 from who they were. \n\nI commend you OP for taking responsibility but make sure you don't take on what doesn't belong to you. \n\nI think giving your adult son a reasonable amount of time to move out is good. It will allow you both to have your own spaces to take care of so when you do come together, it's not as strained.", "Well if my wife didn't get diagnosed, we would be living in a different state altogether right now. He didn't want to come. So he is living with a family member and paying rent. My wife wanted to convince him to move with us,  but I said no. Let him stay.  He needs to learn how to take care of himself. Once she recovers we are out and he's on his own. Je is going to learn quickly or sink. That's on him.", "Kicking him out would be cleaning up the mess he made", "Not entirely true, but fair to an extent. I believe stupid should hurt. He has had consequences.  For example,  he had his own car. He failed to care for it and blew the engine block. He didn't get a new car. We sold it for parts and put it towards what he owed. He's still paying for it.", "I also have ADHD. I'm late for a lot of things. But fuck man, my mum having cancer? I'd leave an hour before I \"had\" to just to be 100% sure I'd be there on time. He's just selfish, unless it was entirely out of control.", "so the parents carry all the mental load to anticipate any single thing the adult, capable son might not care enough to think about", "I guess they were just treating their son as an adult. I am sure it won't happen again.  There was no car related reason that he could not get home at a reasonable time, except that he is selfish and did not care how stressful it would be for his parents.", "Comment thief! You stole [part of this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yl29wk/aita_for_calling_my_son_a_selfish_fk/iuw5j4k/) from u/jwrx\n\nReport u/Elderberreistyf as a bot.", "OP's wife let her 23 year old son borrow her car for the evening when she needed it at 5 AM.\n\nI don't know everything about what is going on, but obviously parenting is contributing to the problem.", "\u2026but he still has access to a car whenever he wants so why is that a punishment?", "Considering OP is ranting in MANY comment about how he must be a shit parent and 'lack of empathy' isn't part of ADD I disagree with you on whether this is information he already knows.\n\nAlso CLEARLY the 23 is the AH. I voted that in my own comment.  I was just saying that while the son is being an AH his behavior makes sense when you know his diagnosis and FIRM boundaries need to be set until he learns to manage himself better. \n\nIe. If he keeps being constantly late and doesn't take it upon himself to set alarms, he shouldn't be loaned their vehicle.", "Completely!  I am in **no way** saying the son isn't the asshole.  He needs to learn to manage his time in an appropriate way.  \n\nI only asked because I was wondering if he was diagnosed and if some medication could help him, because I have several people in my life that weren't diagnosed until their 30s and really struggled with things and had a lot of self-hatred because they didn't understand why things like being on time were so hard for them.", "No, the parents can use clear, adult communication.", "If you know someone is flacky you give the keys to the car insanity is doing the same thing and expecting different results no my opinion stands or thinking about what you have said esh", "Cool story. Maybe the Mom said yes because she was so worried and preoccupied about, you know, having CANCER that she wasn't thinking straight. \n\nYou are either lacking in compassion or real like experience. You hold tight to that opinion.\n\nHave a great day.", "You too I feel that doing in anger helps nothing. That in anger you yourself are accountable", "Ahhhh you're one of those commenters who ignores what the Asshole actually did wrong just because they got cursed out with rude/angry language. \n\nSo your false politeness and \"calm adult demeanor\" would certainly be appropriate if say...because the 23 year was late with a low on gas vehicle, his mother missed her breast cancer surgery and now has to wait weeks/months for a reschedule. Op has no reason to be worried and upset about that outcome at all. /s"]}
