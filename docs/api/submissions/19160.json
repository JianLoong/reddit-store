My husband's family taught him and his siblings the same. At this point, it's second nature for us - you get home and you wash your hands. We also have a toddler who, as toddlers do, gets messy af. So when she gets home, we wash hands and then change her into something not covered in toddler goo.\n\n\n\nEven before our kid we've always asked guests to wash their hands and take their shoes off when they come to our place. While we recognize that taking your shoes off and washing your hands may not be the norm for where we live, we didn't see it as an issue because it doesn't seem like that big of an ask for guests in our home. No one has had a problem with this until our friend (Sophie) brought her new bf (Jason) that we hadn't met before over for our monthly game night.\n\n\n\nSophie and Jason were the first of our friends to arrive, and when we greeted them at the door Sophie started taking her shoes off and Jason kinda stood there awkwardly. I asked him to remove his shoes and explained we don't wear shoes inside and he just said no and tried to walk into our house. My husband stopped him and told him that he needed to take his shoes or leave. He eventually took them off after Sophie asked us to give them a minute. We then asked that he wash his hands before joining us for snacks at the table and he just about lost his shit. He started ranting about how degrading it was that we demanded him, as a guest, to do anything. That just because it's \"our house our rules\" doesn't give us the right to be control freaks. Apparently by asking him to take his shoes off and wash his hands we see him as dirty and inferior to us.\n\n\n\nI tried to explain to him that we don't feel that way, we just want to keep our floors clean and avoid spreading germs, especially with a toddler in the house. He started shouting over me but my husband shut him down and told him to leave and not come back. He asked Sophie if she was coming with him and when she said no he told her to lose his number and go fuck herself. Thankfully, Sophie has no desire to continue her relationship with him after this, but now we're wondering whether asking guests to remove their shoes and wash their hands is demanding and controlling? Are we just ignorant because we grew up doing this?", "created_utc": 1686088403, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/142uhzo/aita_for_demanding_that_people_wash_their_hands/", "score": 47, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don\u2019t wash hands unless I expect to be doing something where it\u2019s necessary to have very clean hands right away. Like if I came over to see your new baby or immediately get to work preparing food. I\u2019ll say that if I go to someone\u2019s home after commuting on public transportation, I\u2019ll wash hands when I come in. But just going over from my suburban house to my friends suburban house, I won\u2019t wash unless there\u2019s a reason or before we eat.", "I\u2019m kind of torn honestly. Taking your shoes off is a very reasonable ask but the washing your hands before entering would annoy me.", "Conflicted here because the shoes off is a cultural norm for a lot of countries because shoes are dirty, but hands is a little rude. \nYou're basically implying that your guests are unclean. \nI get my kids to wash their hands before meals but wouldn't even think to ask an adult to do so. \n\nHis reaction was shocking though.", "I'm Canadian, we always take our shoes off... Like all of us do this unless told specifically to keep them on. \n\nAs for the washing of the hands, I don't see it as a big deal at all but I understand how this guy must have felt. Goes to a strangers house and from your description it seems almost aggressive. You must remove your shoes or LEAVE! You must wash your hands or LEAVE!\n\nThis dude just wanted to play some games and meet some new people and you were super unwelcoming. \n\nESH is my rating, I don't think your rules are too bad but the communication of the rules were way too aggressive. He clearly overreacted as well.", "NTA. And I think you pretty much saved Sophie from a really bad relationship.", "The hand washing is weird. Most people I know have \"shoe free\" houses. It's pretty clear when you walk into a house and see a bench and shoes. But even in my super-OCD MIL's house, I've never encountered a hand washing rule. The only time I've had to wash my hands when entering somewhere, I was also dressing in a gown, mask, hat, gloves, and slippers to visit a very ill relative in the hospital.", "NTA. Removing shoes before entering someone\u2019s home is normal. Most people ask first before they take their shoes off and don\u2019t if the host/hostess says fine to leave them on. As for washing hands, I don\u2019t blame you for insisting before touching snacks, etc. Refusing makes him a rude guest. If he came with me, I would have left with him and would have been embarrassed.", "ESH. He's obviously a giant asshole. I don't think I need to explain how many ways he sucks. In the end you did your friend a favor by showing that he fundamentally sucks as a person.\n\nThat being said washing hands is a weird and high bars of entry. Not difficult just high. If I were your friend/guest that request would set the tone. There is no world where I'd feel fully comfortable in your home, I'd be worried about dirtying it. It's like going to a home where you can't sit on furniture, it's not comfortable to be in. Also you should have told him ahead of time.", "NTA his rant was over the line.\n\nThat said no one has said anything before but people have thought it. \n\nShoes off, fine.\n\nWash your hands to enter the house, fine.\n\nTelling other adults to wash their hands? Condescending", "NTA\n\nThe hand washing isn't something I've encountered before, but it's a reasonable request/prerequisite.

I assume there\u2019s a racial aspect to this, apologies if I\u2019m wrong. But I\u2019m white as mayonnaise and nobody wears shoes inside my house. I also wash my hands every time I come inside. My nibblings know they have to wash their hands, even if they sometimes fight it. They can be gross, but they\u2019re children, learning hopefully. What\u2019s this asshat\u2019s excuse?", "NTA- washing your hands before you eat is pretty common place.  (but doing it just because you walk in the door is abit strange to me).   But his behavior is way off the mark.", "NTA. The shoes thing is culturally normal where I live, it would be weird to wear my shoes in someones house. I've always wondered if people never step in dog crap? Like, in all your life, you've never stepped in it once? Shoes are gross. \n\nThe hand washing is fine by me. I think its gross to share a snack bowl with people who don't wash their hands.", "NTA. Shoes off is a very normal request, its bizarre that he would make a big deal out of that. Hand washing right away is less normal, but still not that weird imo. Hands are gross, they touch a lot of things; doorknobs, phones, car doors, your shoes as you tale them off, all of these things put germs and yuck onto your hands. If you're going to be snacking and hanging out and touching stuff (snacks, game pieces, cards, ect) then you should wash your damn hands ANYWAY.", "NTA.\n\nTaking your shoes off isn\u2019t the cultural norm in many cultures in the US but it\u2019s not unheard of and shouldn\u2019t be surprising. It\u2019s also far more common in other area fo the world. Her boyfriend should have at least heard of this being a custom.\n\nAsking everyone to wash their hands immediately upon entry isn\u2019t something I\u2019ve seen before. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s deserving of an outburst.\n\nThe only thing I can think of that makes his behavior even close to understandable- understandable, not acceptable- is if he felt targeted for some reason. If his background was radically different from everyone else he might have thought the rules were because he specifically was entering the home. Certain races and groups of people have to unfairly and consistently deal with accusations of being unclean. Could this have been possible?", "NTA\n\nWe've started to ask guests to take their shoes off and wash their hands since the pandemic.\n\nI read that in the first 6 months of the pandemic, the amount of food poisoning in the States went down by around 50% as people washed their hands properly.\n\nI now spritz my hands with antiseptic alcohol before I eat outside of my home.", "Ummm ESH- he was over the top about it but I\u2019ve never had anyone demand I wash my hands to enter their home. Shoes off? Fine\u2026 but washing my hands? I\u2019m not a toddler .. I know when my hands are clean. Stop micromanaging peoples hygiene", "NTA for the request but the hand washing thing is weird and does come across as a little controlling. The shoes thing is common, but some people object to it because they have a foot odour problem that is only unleashed when the shoes come off. Either way though his reaction was way over the top.", "NTA. The shoes I understand. Making them wash their hands? That's a bit much to me. I would be weirded out if someone asked me to do that (unless I would be around a baby or someone who is immunocompromised). \n\nBut, I would still do it because your house, your rules.\n\nHis reaction was patently ridiculous, and your friend is all the better for kicking him to the curb.", "NTA but as a guest it would feel weird and demeaning to be asked to wash hands. I just wouldn\u2019t return. And I am a obsessive hand washer. But being asked like that is off putting. It\u2019s not as off putting to communicate it\u2019s a shoe-free home. However, some people do have legitimate reasons for keeping shoes on, so it\u2019s not something I wound dig in over. But I also have wood floors that can be cleaned, white carpet might change my mind.", "NTA \n\nI think Sophie dodged a bullet, and so did you and your husband. Who throws a temper tantrum about washing hands and removing shoes? A toddler.", "NTA - your house, your rules - and it seems like you saved your friend from a kind of crazy person.  **However,** in the future, I think there are better ways to communicate these wishes in order to avoid offending others.  You put \"demanding\" in quotes like it was just part of the outburst, but you actually were kind of a jerk about your standards... I think there are more respectful ways to talk to guests in your home than singling them out and embarrassing them - especially adults.  (\"*Everyone* take your shoes off.\"  \"Would *everyone* mind washing their hands?)", "I mean, technically, NTA, shoes fine, I'll admit I'd be a bit taken aback by the wash your hands bit, but I'd say nothing, and do it.  I'd just be judging you in my head (who tells another adult to wash their hands, I'm not a child, did I wipe my hand in a pile of dog crap between here and my car? I washed my hands before I left,  used hand sanitizer, and was planning on washing my hands before eating anything wtf? The world is covered in germs but sure my hands are the problem, what next should I remove my pants before I sit on their couch since its covered in outside germs) and I'd probably never come back and ask game night to be elsewhere, and I say this as a chronic hand washer, especially after the pandemic.\n\n It's your house, your rules, even if a bit rude. Odd rule aside, his rant was over the top, and Sophie dodged a bullet.", "NTA. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Even if he doesn't adhere to these customs in his own house, even though he doesn't agree with them, he loses nothing by following them when in your house. It doesn't hurt him at all to follow your customs. And you didn't ask him to do anything unreasonable.", "NTA, shows off is standard request. Wash your hands as soon as you come in is a little odd but not unreasonable request. Maybe a little on the rude side maybe but not unreasonable", "NTA, you have the right to have your house rules respected, but for context, I\u2019ve never heard of anyone else doing this before.\n\nI imagine some people like Jason might find this peculiar, so I wonder if alerting your guests ahead of time (before arriving) will allow them time to process and comply", "NAH. But I wouldn't come back. Unless you have some medical issue like a kid living in a bubble, this is a bit much.", "NTA although I would be weirded out if you asked me to wash my hands right when I walked in lol. But your house, your rules. The shoe thing so normal tho, he\u2019s an idiot.", "NTA - I don't think these are big asks with a toddler in the house and esp after covid. His reaction was crazy! For all the comments saying people need a reason to wash their hands, a lot of people never do. \n\nMy dental hygienist told me that pre-covid, she would pump gas and then eat a cheeseburger without thinking anything of it! Gross.\n\nThere are also statistics that show that 40% of men don't wash their hands after using the restroom.", "NTA!!! this is such an easy ask. Don\u2019t ever sweat it, you have a right to ask this of your guests.", "NTA. It\u2019s a little odd but not in a bad way.", "NTA.\n\nThe washing hands thing is different and I\u2019d find it a bit odd but I wouldn\u2019t throw a fit about it like this dude did. It\u2019s not they big of ask.", "I mean honestly washing the hands everytime is excessive and I\u2019d be annoyed af as well.

Hands - insulting unless it would be before holding an infant.", "Technically, NTA, as it's your home.\n\nHowever, it comes across as extremely obsessive, infantilising, and slightly like you are having a power trip.\n\nIf I were met with such expectations arriving at someone's house, I'd just turn around and go back home. No worries.", "INFO: When you go out for a meal at a public place with friends, do you insist that everyone go to the bathroom and wash up before sitting at the table?", "NTA.

That guy was psycho and I doubt he washes his hands when he goes to the loo.", "NTA, it\u2019s not your fault a lot of western people just like to bring filth into their homes and meals. I was raised the same, can\u2019t eat, cook, enter the house without washing hands\u2026 this is especially important once you realise a majority of men don\u2019t wash hands after the loo and I\u2019ve been seeing plenty of girls do the same at work. God knows who touched what and then who touched that and the list goes on\u2026 I once had a friend throw a fit, get offended, and call her parents to be picked up because I said she shouldn\u2019t have hid her phone in maltesers bag of chocolates because her phone has germs and that I would no longer eat it \u2026 \ud83e\udd72 these are grown adults they should be hygienic by default, if you don\u2019t want to be told to be clean then maybe don\u2019t be dirty ..", "NTA.

(Taking off shoes is pretty widely practiced - we do too. We also have a few pairs of guest slippers in the vestibule on offer.) If someone is too weirded out by your house practices, then they can pretend to wash their hands, and in the future just abstain from coming - thereby depriving you of their company. \n\nI do think the hand-washing is sufficiently unusual that it might be a good idea to think about how you communicate it. \"Over here is the hand basin to wash your hands!\" will result in most of your guests to get the hint, and even if some don't, you can't police the quality of their hand-washing anyway.

Pre-covid we were more lax on the handwashing, but after having a kid mid pandemic we became more rigid.
