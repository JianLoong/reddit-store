Once I tried to make friends at some kind of group religious event, but when I heard \"Why are You constantly following me\" I froze and stop trying...It was 16 years ago but still hurts and makes me wonder why am I this way...at least I have one friend who accepts me the way I am and I cherish her for that!!!!!", "NTA\n\nIm autistic as well, and its not dolls but yeah if you hit a subject a may end up info dumping with out even knowing im doing it.

So it may be worth while in the future to just be blunt but nice \"im sorry MR X but this is just a couple friends and your not invited we can catch up another time though\" it may suck at the time but i promise you he will probably prefer this to creating the situation he has. as with gentle nudges in our lovely brains they just seem like problems to be solved rather than a hint your not meant to be there.", "NTA.

I got so mad at that thread because it\u2019s rarely true and one thing we really need to be very careful about managing as autistic people is expectations.

Excluding him when there is a reasonable expectation that he is supposed to be part of the group would not be oke, for example if you went out with all the coworkers except him.\n\nAs you've stated in a comment you were going out with a group of friends which were not all coworkers, he had no reasonable expectstion to be invited.\n\nYou're not an AH for this, but you did handle this completely wrong. I dont always catch all social clues and I would be sad too if I tried to go out with some people and the mention several issues, and I invest my time and energy to overcome (calling the restaurant, aranging a ride) so the plans I am exited for can continue, only to find out that these were not real issues, they were actually hints that I was not invited in the first place. In the future, just be clear to this guy from the start: \"actually, this is not an outing ment for all coworkers, it is just me and coworker A going out with our preexisting friendgroup.\"\n\nNta", "Nta but you could have worded it differently. Maybe sorry bud tonight is not a good time for you to join us.  Now stop talking about your plans in front if him.  Not your job to baby this guy.", "NAH. Everyone talks about inclusion of disabled people but no-one talks about how uncomfortable it can be. Your unfortunate colleague has social deficits to the extent that he doesn't understand when he's not welcome, and doesn't seem to have a good network. And rejection really hurts, and I also understand it's not really his fault. My heart goes out to him. But also it's not your task to cater to his needs. He needs special support to help him find social contacts and make friends, that's not your job.\n\nHowever I did find that your way of indirectly giving \"hints\" and then being full-on direct was, in both times, not an ideal way of communicating. It would be better to say something like \"actually this is something just planned between me and my friend\". It's better to say \"It's just us, without *other* people\" than \"*you* are not welcome\". General rejection of anyone outside of a group is much much gentler than rejecting one person specifically. But you're still quite young so you, too, are still learning about communication. Learn from this story, it's clear from hearing you talk that you have empathy, you just need to refine your phrasing and timing. Be kind with yourself and with him and don't blame yourself for the unfortunate situation he's in. Live and learn.", "NAH, just an awkward situation. Next time, though, y'all should not bring it up within earshot of others: him, or anyone else.", "NTA, and my fianc\u00e9 actually went off on someone who happens to be autistic for trying to invite themselves to our wedding! We and most of our friends are some flavor of neurodivergent (ADHD and/or autism), yet somehow only this person committed such a massive faux pas. Anyway, unfortunately that\u2019s one of those social things this person is going to have to learn.", "NTA. Although one of the hardest parts of being on the spectrum is that neurotypical people don't say what they mean most of the time. Until you said the words that matched what you were trying to tell him you were essentially saying I'd like you to go but this obstacle outside my control is preventing it. You need to say the actual words you want him to hear. Might there have been a nicer way to say that sentence? Maybe 'I don't want to mix my work colleagues with my social friends'. But you aren't an asshole.", "[deleted]", "Autistic here. NTA. Poor guy sounds like he's had more enabling than actual help. I would mention the incident to HR and describe how a male coworker trying to invite himself to a non-work event of yours made you feel uncomfortable, not because he is a gentleman and you a lady, (though obviously that wouldn't reflect well on the company,) but because you're being put in a position of having to manage the unrealistic expectations of an adult coworker with a disability outside of work hours. \n\nAsk if there is someone, ideally a gentleman, more senior to your autistic colleague who can mentor him within the company and help him develop in the soft skills. That is the help he needs, it will provide him with much-needed social interaction and if there is an older gentleman in the company whose skills with, say, technology, are not quite what the market needs, the mentorship *may* prove mutually beneficial.\n\nYou don't want to say 'work dad,' but...work dad.", "YTA for how you interacted with your co-worker.

It\u2019s easy to say to people I don\u2019t want you to come, but just be aware that you might never have been told that to know how it feels", "YTA after edits- Even with the details added after it would have been easier for everyone involved if you had said a little white lie and told him the plans were canceled instead of what you said. We all would love to receive some empathy if we were in his shoes and it's hypocritical to say otherwise.  \n\n\nOriginal response: YTA - I think it is always rude to discuss these kinds of plans in the presence of someone you have no intention of including or inviting. It makes the other person feel excluded, even if they had no desire to join the activity in question in the first place. It sucks that his diagnosis makes it hard for him to understand these hints and social cues but you were insensitive in the way you dismissed him, perhaps a better plan would have been to cancel the plans altogether and have a separate discussion with your coworker to go somewhere else. It is not about you not wanting to make friends with the guy, because you are not obligated to, it was just the lack of tact you had about the whole thing.", "YTA. Don't discuss plans with people infront of people you don't want to invite. It's super rude.\n\nI once walked in on a group of colleagues discussing going out soon.

But I think OP would benefit from reading up on how to interact with people with autism too.", "yeah i cant do like half of what you listed but i don't think that should bar me from getting a job.. for me i think it gets easier the longer i work with someone because i start picking up on social cues bis pattern recognition but i still often get caught off guard \n\nalso very much hoping the benefits linked the marriage thing is stopped in my country.. hoping it actually gets sorted in france :)", "Yes, perfect \ud83d\udc4f", "masking is definitely used in europe (at least in the uk) - camouflaging is a type of masking behaviour, with the other being compensation :)", "Its *a* fact, but not the defining fact. If you only referred to someone as \"the brunette\", or \"the loud one\" or something, you would be taking away all other facets about them and presenting them as one dimensional.  Most people dont want to be defined that way.\n\nMore horrible examples would be defining someone as their diagnosis: \"the autistic one\", \"the adhd one\", yknow?", "Yeah same, from the title I assumed it was a works night out for everyone except the autistic guy. The content made me think it was then just a few colleagues and kinda could see where the mix up came from. The full story definitely paints a different picture!", "Omgosh op. Don't listen to this thread - sure you could've been more direct before he got his hopes up by meeting the hurdles presented. It was probably more disappointing because he thought that this was the only issue.\nBut that's not for you to know how to manage.\nHe's a co-worker who invited himself to a private meetup. He wasn't actually welcome but didn't realize. I'm glad you didn't let him show up and ignore him. This was not a great situation for either of y'all and I'm sorry if you're dealing with tension cause of it.\n\nAlso your friends are just responding to the guilt of the tears they witnessed", "And it is more cruel.\n\nOP this is an ESH situation. There was no way this was going to work out well. What you did was mean but sometimes that is what happens. Could you have handled it better in the long run, probably, but you got frustrated and that is \"normal\". \n\nSuggestion, and OP I hope you see this.\n\nTalk to some comworker queitly that might be okay with taking this guy our for a night to be nice.  See if you can come up with a plan for maybe a tuesday night when the bars are not so busy. Then invite your autistic coworker.  Limit the outing to 1 1/2 hours so there is a set time to arrive and leave. This way his mom can bring him and pick him up. But when the time is up you MUST leave and have him see you leaving. This is important to make hime not feel left out. Gently explain to him that there will be conversations on many topics. Limit them to 5-10 minutes each. Even put on a timer on yiur phone to ensure times are held to. Maybe even make a list of topics before hand and give him some input on the topics. Yes he will want to talk about his Barbie collection and his Autism, But you can listen to that for a few minutes and maybe you will actually learn something interesting. In fact maybe do a bit of research on Barbies so you have some facts he may not know. Then make sure you include him in the other topics. \n\nYes this is a lot of work but it could very well help him learn that Barbies and Autism are not the only topics in the world. \n\nAnd I know it is a lot of work. Not exactly the same but I and some coworkes did this with a down syndrom coworker in the past. It really made working with them easier and also made the coworker extremely happy.", "I really don\u2019t think you all are terribly concerned about his feelings. YTA", "Its literally the same", "It boggles my mind how irrational the YTA people are in this post. Imagine cancelling or altering plans every time someone gets offended they can\u2019t go.", "He was making plans with friends outside of work, not his other coworkers", "Yikes get of your high horse, you cant talk about any activity outside without anyone listening in without your knowledge inviting themselves after many hints?

Now OP is saying this happened outside of work on a video call with his four friends and his coworker overhead the conversation there. \n\nHe should add an edit and just rewrite the entire thing because he left out so many details that it completely changes the whole story.", "What do you mean punished for it?", "You are absolutely nta.\n\n\nIf you don't mind working with this person, sometimes the kinder thing to do is be clear (but neutral to kind) from the beginning. Nice but implicit does not always work for (some) people on the spectrum. \n\n\nThings like, I do not mean to upset you, but these plans are private and do not extend to you. Sorry for the misunderstanding. I would appreciate it if you didn't listen in in the future. \n\n\nYou are also allowed to ask can we change the subject? I'd like to talk about - something else - and we've been discussing - dolls - for - X - minutes now. I'm interested in - something - this other person has to say. \n\nYou didn't do anything wrong, but small changes may make social interaction easier.", "If it makes you feel better get some of the work guys and take him out somewhere you think he would be comfortable. Also let him know you do not mix friends with co-workers.", "> we weren\u2019t all coworkers sitting at a table and excluding him \u2026\n\nHow many of you were coworkers?", "Thank you for the clarification. That makes sense now.\n\nAdd this to your main post. It's important.", "You need to edit your original post. It makes it sound like you discussed it in front of him at work.", "IMO YTA for doing a video call in public. No one else wants to hear your conversation, it's rude.", "Use headphones/earbuds next time if you weren\u2019t this time! And if you were, how unfortunate he decided to invite himself into one side of a conversation.", "Lowkey YTA for not including this kind of information in your original post because it's somewhat relevant for the judgment\n\nEdit to clarify: If this was at work and the outing had been with co-workers, one COULD argue that it was impolite to discuss it in front of a co-worker which wasn't included. But even then, he would be entitled to not include him.\n\nBut because it was a video call at a bus stop where they both were, the verdict is even more clearly a NAH/NTA. (Personally I'm choosing NAH)", "Also, it's harder to diagnose girls because they'll  tend to be better (than boys) at masking their symptoms to fit in with peers.\n\nSadly, a very large number of girls with autism, remain undiagnosed by the age of 18.", "Fellow autistic woman here.\n\nDo you think it's because society coddles boys in general that this happens?", "I could be wrong in my list! I listed what is true for me, but it can work differently for other people (see, I'm still working on it). And yes, pattern recognition is a god send in social clues.", "Thank you!\n\n:)", "yeah.. but just mentioning a fact about someone isn't a bad thing and you said in your post people don't like being called neurotypical not people don't like being defined by the fact they're neurotypical", "A persons feelings can get hurt without someone being an asshole.

Why is it their responsibility to make him feel better? Being autistic is not an excuse to disrespect other people's boundaries and be selfish and totally oblivious to other people's feelings and needs. He jumped in, he overrode op and their friends' boundaries, why should he be rewarded for that?
