I (27M) have  one sibling and it\u2019s my 30 year old sister Bailey. Growing up me and Bailey were only kinda close. She was older, we didn\u2019t really have much in common. It was a pretty standard brother sister relationship. Our parents are still together, so we always do holidays. The last few years it\u2019s been me, my sister, her husband, their kid and my parents. \n\nI always really liked my brother in law. I was a groomsman for him, we golf and game together. Him and my sister started dating back in 2017. He\u2019s been a mainstay at family events. My nephew was born in 2019. So now to the point. About a year ago everything went to shit. My sister came home after picking their kid up from daycare to find herself locked out of the house. Note on the door, along with a DNA test for their kid. BIL wasn\u2019t the dad. I learned from him later on that he was suspicious, heard some rumors and decided to get a test done. Kid wasn\u2019t his. He packed up my sisters stuff, changed the locks, told all mutual friends/family and kicked her out. I later found out it was my sisters best friend who told my BIL. She knew and my sister knew. I was disgusted what kind of person my sister turned out to be. \n\nSo I\u2019ve refused to talk to her the past couple years. Which has caused a lot of family drama. My sister now lives with my parents. Whenever I come over she will take her kid to her room. My parents want me to be an uncle to the kid. But I said I\u2019d only do it if my sister wasn\u2019t around. My sister refused that. So I don\u2019t speak to either of them. Since my parents excuse my sisters shitty behavior I\u2019ve gone low contact with them as well. \n\nTensions between us peaked last Holliday season so I skipped Thanksgiving and Christmas and just went to my GFs family\u2019s instead. That was my plan again this year until my mom called and asked me to come to our families. I asked if my sister would be there. She said of course, she lives at the house. I said I won\u2019t be attending then, and will keep the plans to go to my GFs. My mom started begging for me to reconsider and spouting her typical religious BS about love and forgiveness. Which I reminded her she was judgy AF growing up and only turned into Mother Theresa after what Bailey did. So cut the theatrics. I said my sister and her kid could join them after I leave. I\u2019ll stop by quickly if that makes her feel better. But I won\u2019t be forced to be around my sister. As I\u2019m still friends with BIL and my sisters ex best friend. My GF also dislikes my sister and I\u2019m not gonna make her uncomfortable. So just to let me know. My dad texted me after and called me an AH. I didn\u2019t respond.

But people make mistakes, sometimes bad ones and sometimes ridiculously self-inflicted and easily avoidable - I'm not going to chop someone out for something they did to someone else, that frankly is something that's fairly common and happens to a lot of people.  Did she hurt you?  Or are you just disappointed?  Consider this.  I don't see that you have a valid reason to stop talking to your sister just because she cheated on her husband - that's disappointing (even disgusting), but hardly earth-shattering to your life, right?", "NTA. Strange how so many people on this subreddit specifically for judging morality can\u2019t comprehend\u2026 caring about morality. \n\nOut of curiosity, does her ex pay child support? Is your nephew\u2019s actual father involved?

Free place to live, free childcare, and being paid out for half of the house?", "It\u2019s the part where these super religious people, who judge EVERYONE suddenly want to turn the other cheek on her adultery.  They want to use family and religion when it suits them and forget it when it doesn\u2019t; hypocrites who want to use guilt to get their way.", "It's hard to do that with a toddler.  As the kid grows up, OP can set aside some time to be a fun uncle out of the orbit of his sister.", "I don't think he is overly invested.  I've read  many such stories here -- cheating sibling moves back to family home with her child -- and it often leads to severe destabilization of the family and uncovers more than one rift.   The parents are always so willing to support the wayward daughter and channel their concerns onto the baby that they completely lose sight of the effect said support has on other family members.   They make a conscious choice to deprecate every on else's feelings.  After a while they start complaining because they just don't think the wayward daughter is being treated well by others, that they aren't being \"fair\" to the child, etc.   It becomes an emotional nightmare with parents trying to guilt the other siblings into \"rising above the situation\" etc.  It' emotional blackmail writ large.\n\nIn some cases, the betrayed partner was another [sibling].  Here it was a very good friend.  Siblings in these situations have every right, indeed a responsibility to protect themselves with the limited options available.   If the OP doesn't want to witness the disregard his parents have for everyone else's feelings, he should opt out.", "Because he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with people who have no morals. I also choose not to spend time with people like that.

Her husband was OP's close friend. If anyone did this to a close friend, I wouldn't want to be around them either.\n\nAlso, can we just accept that people can have empathy for others and not want to be around people who cheat and lie to their spouses? The hurt doesn't have to directly be ours for us to not want to around people who intentionally hurt others.\n\nI'm not so sure she is suffering the consequences of her actions either. She now has more freedom than she did when she was married. Live-in babysitting is a great plus and no bills while the ex is paying child support is pretty nice. Her child and her ex are the ones suffering the biggest consequences, and that is something that could also make OP not want to see her. \n\nI don't know what I'd fully feel in this situation, but I know I would feel the sister caused more consequences in other people's lives than she was facing for herself and I would have a hard time with that.", "I don't think comments like this fully appreciate his sister's situation *today*.  Yes, she lost her husband.   Materially though, she is better set up than the vast majority of single mothers.

So no, the consequences aren't nearly what you paint.", "> There's no way a parent could leave their child and grandchild on the street.\n\nWhy would you frame the situation that way?  The OP says that his sister got half the proceeds of the sale of their home.  She was never going to be \"on the street\" and certainly wouldn't have to be a year and a half out.   Why are his parents sheltering her from the consequences of her actions...which is that her choices led down the path to single motherhood.  \n\nHis mom's begging to pretend that they can go back to being one happy family is selfishness on her part and ignores the hurt he feels that his own sister would inflict such pain on his good friend.  She wants to rug-sweep his feelings to promote her fantasy family.", "Sis has been mooching off her parents for over a year now.  OP is saying his mother is being hypocritical and trying to rug sweep the consequences of sister's cheating.

When she allowed her husband to put his name on the birth certificate? When she allowed her husband to invest his emotional, physical, and financial resources into a child that wasn\u2019t his? Just trying to figure out which of those counts as the one mistake, because to me it looks like a whole series of choices over a long period of time made by someone who must have zero empathy and zero integrity.

She is now living rent free. Free childcare. What were her real repercussions? She got paid out for half the home. I\u2019m not advocating my parents loose two kids.

I don\u2019t really think their needed to be much explanation", "Cheating occurs because the cheater is a bad person.", "That's not fair.  Why can't he be allowed to have a boundary against infidelity, even if it wasn't against him?

I wouldn\u2019t want a relationship with her either.", "Grow up.", "Let me be clear what the sister did was absolutely wrong but I feel 'rising above' the situation is being an adult. Can anyone change what has happened? No. Should sister and nephew live in squalar with no family support because that's \"justice\" and its what the sister deserves with the nephew tagging along for the ride? I don't think that would be fair. OPs parents are doing their best in a crappy situation. If they hadn't 'risen above' the situation they would be not having contact with either their daughter or grandson and that is not ideal for anybody. Right now the person who needs most thought and protection is the nephew and this is how they are providing it. OP is not doing his best as an uncle because he is obsessed with punishing his sister rather than being a positive male role model helping the next generation to make better decisions.", "I see your perspective. Reading it it seems that you have written it assuming the overly invested mindset is already there.

That's him trying to compromise because his mother won't get off his back about being at Thanksgiving. At no point did he dictate how the should run their household.

Unlike his parents, who are actively demanding he ignore his own boundary, he is giving them a choice and since they've chosen to include their daughter, he's chosen to respect that choice by sticking to his other plans. Some families are divided and that's just life. If they want their son in their lives more, they need to be willing to accommodate him. Sucks for her, but she shouldn't have hiked up her skirt for a man that wasn't her husband if she didn't want to lose most or all of her social circle.
