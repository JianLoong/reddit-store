I (27M) have  one sibling and it\u2019s my 30 year old sister Bailey. Growing up me and Bailey were only kinda close. She was older, we didn\u2019t really have much in common. It was a pretty standard brother sister relationship. Our parents are still together, so we always do holidays. The last few years it\u2019s been me, my sister, her husband, their kid and my parents. \n\nI always really liked my brother in law. I was a groomsman for him, we golf and game together. Him and my sister started dating back in 2017. He\u2019s been a mainstay at family events. My nephew was born in 2019. So now to the point. About a year ago everything went to shit. My sister came home after picking their kid up from daycare to find herself locked out of the house. Note on the door, along with a DNA test for their kid. BIL wasn\u2019t the dad. I learned from him later on that he was suspicious, heard some rumors and decided to get a test done. Kid wasn\u2019t his. He packed up my sisters stuff, changed the locks, told all mutual friends/family and kicked her out. I later found out it was my sisters best friend who told my BIL. She knew and my sister knew. I was disgusted what kind of person my sister turned out to be. \n\nSo I\u2019ve refused to talk to her the past couple years. Which has caused a lot of family drama. My sister now lives with my parents. Whenever I come over she will take her kid to her room. My parents want me to be an uncle to the kid. But I said I\u2019d only do it if my sister wasn\u2019t around. My sister refused that. So I don\u2019t speak to either of them. Since my parents excuse my sisters shitty behavior I\u2019ve gone low contact with them as well. \n\nTensions between us peaked last Holliday season so I skipped Thanksgiving and Christmas and just went to my GFs family\u2019s instead. That was my plan again this year until my mom called and asked me to come to our families. I asked if my sister would be there. She said of course, she lives at the house. I said I won\u2019t be attending then, and will keep the plans to go to my GFs. My mom started begging for me to reconsider and spouting her typical religious BS about love and forgiveness. Which I reminded her she was judgy AF growing up and only turned into Mother Theresa after what Bailey did. So cut the theatrics. I said my sister and her kid could join them after I leave. I\u2019ll stop by quickly if that makes her feel better. But I won\u2019t be forced to be around my sister. As I\u2019m still friends with BIL and my sisters ex best friend. My GF also dislikes my sister and I\u2019m not gonna make her uncomfortable. So just to let me know. My dad texted me after and called me an AH. I didn\u2019t respond.

But people make mistakes, sometimes bad ones and sometimes ridiculously self-inflicted and easily avoidable - I'm not going to chop someone out for something they did to someone else, that frankly is something that's fairly common and happens to a lot of people.  Did she hurt you?  Or are you just disappointed?  Consider this.  I don't see that you have a valid reason to stop talking to your sister just because she cheated on her husband - that's disappointing (even disgusting), but hardly earth-shattering to your life, right?", "NTA. Strange how so many people on this subreddit specifically for judging morality can\u2019t comprehend\u2026 caring about morality. \n\nOut of curiosity, does her ex pay child support?

Free place to live, free childcare, and being paid out for half of the house?", "It\u2019s the part where these super religious people, who judge EVERYONE suddenly want to turn the other cheek on her adultery.  They want to use family and religion when it suits them and forget it when it doesn\u2019t; hypocrites who want to use guilt to get their way.", "It's hard to do that with a toddler.  As the kid grows up, OP can set aside some time to be a fun uncle out of the orbit of his sister.", "I don't think he is overly invested.  I've read  many such stories here -- cheating sibling moves back to family home with her child -- and it often leads to severe destabilization of the family and uncovers more than one rift.   The parents are always so willing to support the wayward daughter and channel their concerns onto the baby that they completely lose sight of the effect said support has on other family members.   They make a conscious choice to deprecate every on else's feelings.  After a while they start complaining because they just don't think the wayward daughter is being treated well by others, that they aren't being \"fair\" to the child, etc.   It becomes an emotional nightmare with parents trying to guilt the other siblings into \"rising above the situation\" etc.  It' emotional blackmail writ large.\n\nIn some cases, the betrayed partner was another [sibling].  Here it was a very good friend.  Siblings in these situations have every right, indeed a responsibility to protect themselves with the limited options available.   If the OP doesn't want to witness the disregard his parents have for everyone else's feelings, he should opt out.", "Because he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with people who have no morals. I also choose not to spend time with people like that.

Her husband was OP's close friend. If anyone did this to a close friend, I wouldn't want to be around them either.\n\nAlso, can we just accept that people can have empathy for others and not want to be around people who cheat and lie to their spouses? The hurt doesn't have to directly be ours for us to not want to around people who intentionally hurt others.\n\nI'm not so sure she is suffering the consequences of her actions either. She now has more freedom than she did when she was married. Live-in babysitting is a great plus and no bills while the ex is paying child support is pretty nice. Her child and her ex are the ones suffering the biggest consequences, and that is something that could also make OP not want to see her. \n\nI don't know what I'd fully feel in this situation, but I know I would feel the sister caused more consequences in other people's lives than she was facing for herself and I would have a hard time with that.", "I don't think comments like this fully appreciate his sister's situation *today*.  Yes, she lost her husband.   Materially though, she is better set up than the vast majority of single mothers.

So no, the consequences aren't nearly what you paint.", "> There's no way a parent could leave their child and grandchild on the street.\n\nWhy would you frame the situation that way?  The OP says that his sister got half the proceeds of the sale of their home.  She was never going to be \"on the street\" and certainly wouldn't have to be a year and a half out.   Why are his parents sheltering her from the consequences of her actions...which is that her choices led down the path to single motherhood.  \n\nHis mom's begging to pretend that they can go back to being one happy family is selfishness on her part and ignores the hurt he feels that his own sister would inflict such pain on his good friend.  She wants to rug-sweep his feelings to promote her fantasy family.", "Sis has been mooching off her parents for over a year now.  OP is saying his mother is being hypocritical and trying to rug sweep the consequences of sister's cheating.

When she allowed her husband to put his name on the birth certificate? When she allowed her husband to invest his emotional, physical, and financial resources into a child that wasn\u2019t his? Just trying to figure out which of those counts as the one mistake, because to me it looks like a whole series of choices over a long period of time made by someone who must have zero empathy and zero integrity.

I wouldn\u2019t want a relationship with her either.", "Grow up.", "Let me be clear what the sister did was absolutely wrong but I feel 'rising above' the situation is being an adult. Can anyone change what has happened? No. Should sister and nephew live in squalar with no family support because that's \"justice\" and its what the sister deserves with the nephew tagging along for the ride? I don't think that would be fair. OPs parents are doing their best in a crappy situation. If they hadn't 'risen above' the situation they would be not having contact with either their daughter or grandson and that is not ideal for anybody. Right now the person who needs most thought and protection is the nephew and this is how they are providing it. OP is not doing his best as an uncle because he is obsessed with punishing his sister rather than being a positive male role model helping the next generation to make better decisions.", "I see your perspective. Reading it it seems that you have written it assuming the overly invested mindset is already there.

Is that exactly moral? You condone that", "I don't get those comments either. It's not like he should be forced to have a relationship with his sister? Yes, she did nothing to him directly, but he is *disgusted* by her behavior and character that he doesn't want to associate with her at all. That she is even capable of doing something that horrendous. It would be enough for me to disassociate with someone, as I've done it for less (like bullying).\n\nAlso the idea that the child is somehow suffering without the uncle in his life is laughable. The child was what? Sub 2 years old when this happened? Doubt he even knows who OP is. And again, OP doesn't owe anyone a relationship.", "My only regret is that I have but one upvote to give. This is 100% spot on.", "I\u2019m going to go out on a limb and say pretty sure she isn\u2019t now livin\u2019 it up and toasting her good fortune.", "No consequences? She lost her marriage and her home (BIL threw her and the child out with no notice...he had a right to be angry but that's a huge consequence) and a year to get back on her feet after losing everything is not an unreasonable length of time(yes due to her own actions). I am no way defending Bailey...but the parents have the right to forgive and support their daughter and grandchildren. Brother is  being judgemental and controlling over the issue that is...none of his business.", "Yeah what she did was extremely fucked up. NTA. I would just say to try to limit the effects that that this choice has on your relationship with your parents. Low contact is the best idea until your sister moves out of their house. I know first hand how frustrating it is to see your parents seemingly enable and excuse her shitty behavior, but it\u2019s extremely difficult for them to cut her off, or even hold her properly accountable, when their grandchild is involved and potentially at stake. They\u2019re probably putting up with her to protect their relationship with your nephew. \n\nWhenever she\u2019s brought up as a subject, just repeat that their relationship with her is their business, but you can\u2019t forgive what she\u2019s done and want be involved with her. They\u2019ll eventually accept it.\n\nEdit: Did you maintain contact with your exBIL? Do you know how he\u2019s coping with this?", "Yes the mother is also being TA..but There many ways these days to still have contact and not see them.. he has made it even more confusing by taking himself completely away\u2026he can voice/video call - play games with him online, write a letter .. so many other ways but he chooses only the seeing in person option. \nA child will only think they have done something wrong- they don\u2019t know adult life\u2026they only know who is in their lives and who suddenly disappeared\u2026and if they had a previous relationship it would be very hurtful for that kid.", "Considering the statistics on cheating there is a lot of bad character than.", "Just curious. What's the back story on this. It's clear that you use the infidelity as aconvenient way to cut ties. Why is that?", "Does your sister work?  Is she actively looking for a place to live on her own?", "In the basement? Is that where she lives or do you think she should go there instead of her room?\n\nAnd you think she doesn\u2019t have any repercussions? She lost her husband. She lost the trust of many people. Just because her parents help her doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t showing their disappointment with her. You don\u2019t know that as you cut contact. She has a son who will ask questions. \n\nYou are refusing to see that there are in fact repercussions and think she got off free", "Better yet - she should be forced to wear a scarlet A for the rest of her life.", "The simple reality is that associate with cheaters. Probably all the time. You just don't know it. \n\nAnd that's at the center of this issue. He is punishing his parents and nephew over something his sister did to someone else. We have btw zero backstory on the marriage. \n\nHowever we do know that op has used the infidelity of his sister as a convenient excuse to cut ties with his family. \n\nThe post mostly makes me wonder two things. How he would have cut ties if this didn't happen because it's almost certain op would have. Further why he dislikes his sister so much.", "Because its his sister. Someone he grew up with an was apparently close to as a kid. Family doesn\u2019t drop one another after they made huge mistakes. Just because your child is a horrible murderer doesn\u2019t mean its not your child anymore. Being a family doesn\u2019t automatically mean you are fine with what they did. You can still be friends with people who cheated while simultaneously letting them know you are disappointed in them and you won\u2019t let them do it ever again.\n\nThis black and white attitude so many people online have is deeply harmful and flawed. And as shitty as cheating is it doesn\u2019t deserve the same treatment as violent criminals.", "If that's what it is, that's what it is.  He shouldn't be forced into a relationship with ANYONE, especially with his nephew if his sister is using the nephew as a tool, which I believe she is.  Again, I really feel bad for the nephew but he can't allow her to weaponize that nephew to force him into a familial relationship with her he doesn't want.", "Sounds like it, yes. And that\u2019s okay. He\u2019s not required to have a relationship with his nephew. Doesn\u2019t matter if he did anything or not.", "He said he would like to have one, but it can't include sister. She is the one refusing those terms.", "> Should sister and nephew live in squalar with no family support\n\nThere no evidence that Bailey and her son would ever live in squalor.  His parent's are not doing their best, they are enabling her to play the victim.  After a year and a half, their daughter should have a clear plan for moving out and standing on her own two feet.  *That* would be rising above things.  Right now she is feeding off her parents' empathy and money expecting everyone to feel sorry for her.\n\nYou really do not get it, OP is not punishing anyone.  He is protecting himself and living his life.  It's his mother who views his separating himself from Bailey's sordid behavior as \"punishment\".   And the primary person to be a role model for the boy would be his biological father -- who remain unmentioned by anyone.  Bailey knows who he is, has she done the responsible thing: let him know he has a son and pursue child support so her son will never have to live on the charity of others?", "It's appears over and over in this and other subreddits.   The OP's sister left her husband over a year ago and got a payout for the marital home.   Why is she still living at home?   Is she working?n\n\nAnd yes the over-invested mindset is evident in the way his mom is trying to guilt him to attend Christmas at their house.   She can ask and should accept his answer.", "Precisely.", "Yes the parents have a right to forgive and support. And OP has the right to NOT forgive and NOT support. He's sister is a liar and a cheat who didn't care about anyone but herself (evident by letting a man think he was the father of a child when she knew he wasn't but let him bond with the child anyway and withheld it from him for years because it benefited her). And because she became this person, OP doesn't want anything to do with her. That is his choice to make and he's entitled to feel how he feels about it. This isn't much different than person A being friends with a couple and the couple breaking up because someone cheated and Person A  choosing the friend that didn't cheat. Just because they are blood related doesn't mean he has to choose his sister or support her. Every action has consequences. Just because one of her consequences is that her marriage is ruined, doesn't mean she can't also have a consequence of her brother not liking the person she's become and not wanting to be around her.", "The child still young enough that the mom has to be okay with calls and video calls. I doubt this child has its own phone, for the child is three. So not possible to play game\u2019s online either. Also someone has to read those letters out to the child. Which means op parents go behind the sister back to allow phone calls.", "If she wasn't already, over time,  the live-in cheating sibling becomes the favored sibling because parents decide that the welfare of the child trumps any and everything else.   The OP should probably put more distance between himself and his parents because it will get worse, and more hurtful.", "This was not just a mistake. This was a concerted effort by OPs sister to trick her husband into raising a kid that wasn't his own.\n\nOr, in other words, paternity fraud.\n\nCheating once, I can maybe allow as a mistake. But an ongoing campaign of lying, that had been going on for years? Nah, fuck that, and fuck her.", "To be honest i think is ridiculous if he doesn't want a relationship with his sister shouldn't have a relationship with his sister. But he can't force everyone to choose between his sister and him considering that his sister didn't do anything to him. I don't like cheaters, not liars but i can see that as a parent you will always try to help your kids and try to make them bond because when you died they still have each other. Also what does OP want? that his sister disappear so he can have a relationship with his parents? I will go with EHS except for his parents an nephew. His sister fot the obvious reasons and OP for punish guilty and innocents in the same way.", "[deleted]", "Yes and if the post was from Bailey saying I cheated and let my hubby think he was the father I would agree...she was an ahole 100%. But the post is about the brother making an ultimatum to his parents about how they need to run their household over an issue that has no bearing on his life.  I stand firm that unless there is an actual abuse or violence issue its an ahole move to pull the \"her or me move\" especially to the parents. And this feels indicative of more deep-seated animosity than just sis cheating on her husband.", "However why is op so invested in this?", "He's not forcing anyone to do anything.  He is simply standing his ground that he wants nothing to do with his sister.  You can think it's ridiculous, but she did something really despicable that he can't find forgiveness for, so I personally respect his feelings.", "This is a bad take. A parent trying to force \"bonding\" by shitting over one kid's boundaries and perspective just breeds resentment. It pushes the kids farther apart. It's really very basic.", "He is not the one begging. He was happy spending the holidays with his Gf\u2019s family.", "That his parents should leave the OP to alone to deal (or not deal) with his sister and her child.   If she had moved into her own apartment, they would not be so intent on forcing him to be in her presence.", "He didn't say how they need to run their household. If that was the case then he would demand that they kick their daughter out etc. What he did was decline to go to Thanksgiving dinner at his parent's house because his sister will be there because he doesn't want to have to be around his sister. After his mom continued to beg he said he would come if the sister would leave long enough for him to drop in for a few minutes. That's him trying to compromise because his mother won't get off his back about being at Thanksgiving. At no point did he dictate how the should run their household. And there very well might be some animosity or resentment toward the sister for something else, but at the end of the day no matter what the reason his boundary is that he doesn't want to be around his sister.", "In the moment he is rejecting being in the same place with her sister, he is making people choose. I don't condone the actions of the sister in any way, but his feelings for his sister are ruling their actions to his parents and nephew.", "Interesting but this doesn't address ops investment in the situation.", "He just set boundaries. He told everyone that he does not want to associate with someone of low moral character. \n\nHis parents know his boundaries and do not respect them. They are AH for telling him he should do something he doesn\u2019t want or need to do. \n\nOP is NTA.", "He is not making people choose. They have already chosen to forgive this heinous act performed by sister. They have made their choice and he is doing the best he can to stay in contact with his family based on their choice.", "I'm going to leave my comfort zone of 'lurker' as this story resonates with me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile the sister's actions do not involve the OP, it probably does change how the OP sees his sister.  I have a sibling who did something - not cheating - but still something that I found abhorrent, and I'll never be able to look at them the same again.  The offended party has chosen to forgive them, but I cannot.  However, I'm still civil to my sibling at family functions.  I still love my sibling but I can no longer be vested or supportive of their life choices, even good choices.  Until they acknowledge the wrong they've done, I can't go back to how things were.\n\nAnd I still have boundaries.  We had a family trip that required driving five hours in the car, and due to the size of our families, we'd have to take multiple cars, with the likely arrangements of me and my sibling alone in my car.  I told my mom I can't do it.  She was sad but accepted my answer.  I drove alone while my family was in the other car.", "So why are you so invested in that? That's the question i asked op, asked that other commenter and now am asking you.", "I don\u2019t understand why you\u2019re playing dumb about this. People judge others based on how they treat other people all the time. OP\u2019s sister sounds like a selfish leech and I can certainly understand why OP wouldn\u2019t want to spend time with her even if he wasn\u2019t the one directly betrayed by her."]}
