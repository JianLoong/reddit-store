I (27M) have  one sibling and it\u2019s my 30 year old sister Bailey. Growing up me and Bailey were only kinda close. She was older, we didn\u2019t really have much in common. It was a pretty standard brother sister relationship. Our parents are still together, so we always do holidays. The last few years it\u2019s been me, my sister, her husband, their kid and my parents. \n\nI always really liked my brother in law. I was a groomsman for him, we golf and game together. Him and my sister started dating back in 2017. He\u2019s been a mainstay at family events. My nephew was born in 2019. So now to the point. About a year ago everything went to shit. My sister came home after picking their kid up from daycare to find herself locked out of the house. Note on the door, along with a DNA test for their kid. BIL wasn\u2019t the dad. I learned from him later on that he was suspicious, heard some rumors and decided to get a test done. Kid wasn\u2019t his. He packed up my sisters stuff, changed the locks, told all mutual friends/family and kicked her out. I later found out it was my sisters best friend who told my BIL. She knew and my sister knew. I was disgusted what kind of person my sister turned out to be. \n\nSo I\u2019ve refused to talk to her the past couple years. Which has caused a lot of family drama. My sister now lives with my parents. Whenever I come over she will take her kid to her room. My parents want me to be an uncle to the kid. But I said I\u2019d only do it if my sister wasn\u2019t around. My sister refused that. So I don\u2019t speak to either of them. Since my parents excuse my sisters shitty behavior I\u2019ve gone low contact with them as well. \n\nTensions between us peaked last Holliday season so I skipped Thanksgiving and Christmas and just went to my GFs family\u2019s instead. That was my plan again this year until my mom called and asked me to come to our families. I asked if my sister would be there. She said of course, she lives at the house. I said I won\u2019t be attending then, and will keep the plans to go to my GFs. My mom started begging for me to reconsider and spouting her typical religious BS about love and forgiveness. Which I reminded her she was judgy AF growing up and only turned into Mother Theresa after what Bailey did. So cut the theatrics. I said my sister and her kid could join them after I leave. I\u2019ll stop by quickly if that makes her feel better. But I won\u2019t be forced to be around my sister. As I\u2019m still friends with BIL and my sisters ex best friend. My GF also dislikes my sister and I\u2019m not gonna make her uncomfortable. So just to let me know. My dad texted me after and called me an AH. I didn\u2019t respond.

Did she hurt you?  Or are you just disappointed?  Consider this.  I don't see that you have a valid reason to stop talking to your sister just because she cheated on her husband - that's disappointing (even disgusting), but hardly earth-shattering to your life, right?", "NTA. Strange how so many people on this subreddit specifically for judging morality can\u2019t comprehend\u2026 caring about morality. \n\nOut of curiosity, does her ex pay child support?

Free place to live, free childcare, and being paid out for half of the house?", "It\u2019s the part where these super religious people, who judge EVERYONE suddenly want to turn the other cheek on her adultery.

As the kid grows up, OP can set aside some time to be a fun uncle out of the orbit of his sister.", "I don't think he is overly invested.  I've read  many such stories here -- cheating sibling moves back to family home with her child -- and it often leads to severe destabilization of the family and uncovers more than one rift.   The parents are always so willing to support the wayward daughter and channel their concerns onto the baby that they completely lose sight of the effect said support has on other family members.   They make a conscious choice to deprecate every on else's feelings.  After a while they start complaining because they just don't think the wayward daughter is being treated well by others, that they aren't being \"fair\" to the child, etc.   It becomes an emotional nightmare with parents trying to guilt the other siblings into \"rising above the situation\" etc.  It' emotional blackmail writ large.\n\nIn some cases, the betrayed partner was another [sibling].  Here it was a very good friend.  Siblings in these situations have every right, indeed a responsibility to protect themselves with the limited options available.   If the OP doesn't want to witness the disregard his parents have for everyone else's feelings, he should opt out.", "Because he doesn\u2019t want to spend time with people who have no morals. I also choose not to spend time with people like that.

Her husband was OP's close friend. If anyone did this to a close friend, I wouldn't want to be around them either.\n\nAlso, can we just accept that people can have empathy for others and not want to be around people who cheat and lie to their spouses? The hurt doesn't have to directly be ours for us to not want to around people who intentionally hurt others.\n\nI'm not so sure she is suffering the consequences of her actions either. She now has more freedom than she did when she was married. Live-in babysitting is a great plus and no bills while the ex is paying child support is pretty nice. Her child and her ex are the ones suffering the biggest consequences, and that is something that could also make OP not want to see her. \n\nI don't know what I'd fully feel in this situation, but I know I would feel the sister caused more consequences in other people's lives than she was facing for herself and I would have a hard time with that.", "I don't think comments like this fully appreciate his sister's situation *today*.  Yes, she lost her husband.   Materially though, she is better set up than the vast majority of single mothers.

So no, the consequences aren't nearly what you paint.", "> There's no way a parent could leave their child and grandchild on the street.\n\nWhy would you frame the situation that way?  The OP says that his sister got half the proceeds of the sale of their home.  She was never going to be \"on the street\" and certainly wouldn't have to be a year and a half out.   Why are his parents sheltering her from the consequences of her actions...which is that her choices led down the path to single motherhood.  \n\nHis mom's begging to pretend that they can go back to being one happy family is selfishness on her part and ignores the hurt he feels that his own sister would inflict such pain on his good friend.  She wants to rug-sweep his feelings to promote her fantasy family.", "Sis has been mooching off her parents for over a year now.  OP is saying his mother is being hypocritical and trying to rug sweep the consequences of sister's cheating.

When she allowed her husband to put his name on the birth certificate? When she allowed her husband to invest his emotional, physical, and financial resources into a child that wasn\u2019t his? Just trying to figure out which of those counts as the one mistake, because to me it looks like a whole series of choices over a long period of time made by someone who must have zero empathy and zero integrity.

I wouldn\u2019t want a relationship with her either.", "Grow up.", "Let me be clear what the sister did was absolutely wrong but I feel 'rising above' the situation is being an adult. Can anyone change what has happened? No. Should sister and nephew live in squalar with no family support because that's \"justice\" and its what the sister deserves with the nephew tagging along for the ride? I don't think that would be fair. OPs parents are doing their best in a crappy situation. If they hadn't 'risen above' the situation they would be not having contact with either their daughter or grandson and that is not ideal for anybody. Right now the person who needs most thought and protection is the nephew and this is how they are providing it. OP is not doing his best as an uncle because he is obsessed with punishing his sister rather than being a positive male role model helping the next generation to make better decisions.", "I see your perspective. Reading it it seems that you have written it assuming the overly invested mindset is already there.

And because she became this person, OP doesn't want anything to do with her. That is his choice to make and he's entitled to feel how he feels about it. This isn't much different than person A being friends with a couple and the couple breaking up because someone cheated and Person A  choosing the friend that didn't cheat.

After his mom continued to beg he said he would come if the sister would leave long enough for him to drop in for a few minutes. That's him trying to compromise because his mother won't get off his back about being at Thanksgiving. At no point did he dictate how the should run their household.

The offended party has chosen to forgive them, but I cannot.  However, I'm still civil to my sibling at family functions.  I still love my sibling but I can no longer be vested or supportive of their life choices, even good choices.  Until they acknowledge the wrong they've done, I can't go back to how things were.\n\nAnd I still have boundaries.

People die all the time, but do you go up to grieving people and tell them to get over it because it happens every day to a million other people? I certainly hope not.

OP just needs to wait it out, so it's not like the door is closed forever. Also, as you said, she's almost 30 and her affair was outed a few years ago; what are her plans from here on out?

Doesn't matter what the reasons are; you're not obligated to have a relationship with anyone just because people say you should. Unlike his parents, who are actively demanding he ignore his own boundary, he is giving them a choice and since they've chosen to include their daughter, he's chosen to respect that choice by sticking to his other plans. Some families are divided and that's just life. If they want their son in their lives more, they need to be willing to accommodate him. Sucks for her, but she shouldn't have hiked up her skirt for a man that wasn't her husband if she didn't want to lose most or all of her social circle.

In all honesty...it\u2019s not OP\u2019s marriage. Why is he so bent out of shape over her cheating on her husband? It doesn\u2019t hurt OP in the least...specially since he got to keep BIL as a bestie. I just don\u2019t understand why it\u2019s so impactful to OP that they had to go NC. The sister did nothing to him.", "Really? Was it because no 30-60 day notice before she had to move out? Or is there more that I'm not seeing?\n\n(I sound sarcastic, I know, but I'm genuinely asking!)", "**THIS**\n\nThe comments here are wild. Legally, he evicted a woman and child without cause or notice. Morally, he locked *a child* out of their home. That poor kid had no idea what was happening - came home from school to find himself homeless because \"dad\" kicked him and mom out. Say what you will about the sister, but in no world did her kid deserve that.", "This isn't legality sub, this is a morality sub. He found out his spouse had been lying to him and using him. He removed her from his life and that, in the distinction of morality, is not wrong, because morally if you find out someone is screwing you, the worst decision is to support the person who is fucking you over", "I mean, the whole family hasn't been ruined. One arm of the family got screwed up. But that man is no longer a part of their lives. It doesn't have to stay a messy situation, except it's Op's crusade to punish her in perpetuity that is causing a continued ugly family dynamic.", "Yeah, this is still not his business. But he likes being on his high horse so he can have Thanksgiving up there.", "This is the same for me, like if you support that, you're not as bad as the person who cheated, but you stink of the shit.\n\nThe issue here is that he's not cutting off family, he's stayed family with his brother-in-law, he just doesn't want his cheating lying sister. Blood isn't what makes family, and the fact that they are trying to use the child as leverage to force people into contact with her and are willing to isolate the kid for that purpose is terrible", "Why would she let a stranger hang out with her 10 year old? If they don\u2019t have a relationship now, he\u2019s not going to be the fun uncle later.", "Really? You think his sister is going to be ok with that? Unless she just wants a free babysitter there is no way in hell I\u2019d let even a sibling spend unsupervised rime with my kids if they went no contact on me.", "You sound like your sister cheated on you.", "This seems overkill.", "Good for you. I'm glad you've already set your moral lines. It's best to ignore the people who truly think her cheating and lying to her spouse for years are not massive issues that tell you exactly who she is", "Lol thats all you got cute", "Really sad as well because the only parent remaining is the mother who betrayed the kid, *because* she betrayed the kid. Meeting a parent later in life isn\u2019t the same as having them raise you from infancy.", "As I was reading your initial description, I thought, \"$100 says the best friend is now dating her ex.\"  Ha.  I was right.  You've gotta wonder, man.", "Wait\u2026.what?!? Mmmmm is that why she told him? This makes me question her motivations. What your sister did was wrong no question there. Just messed up if the best friend only said something about it because she wanted him for herself.", "BF knew all along but waited to drop the bomb and now she's dating the ex husband.  Yeah she's the standard for moral compass. Bet she's been flirting with the ex and finally got her chance. How convenient", ">Second, if she hasn't shown any remorse for what she did, she should absolutely be a pariah\n\nWe don't know If she has remorse or not.\n\n>People die all the time, but do you go up to grieving people and tell them to get over it because it happens every day to a million other people? \n\nApples and oranges. And OP wasn't the one who was cheated on \n\n>Cheating and tricking someone into raising a child that isn't theirs says A LOT about a person the same way defending that sort of character says a lot about a person\n\nWe don't know If she knew that the Kid wasn't her husband.\n\n\nFrom what OP has told us, there is a probability, that the marriage was a rocky one, even before the cheating came out. The friend hears rumours that OP's sister was unfaithful. Instead of talking to her, He gets a paternity test behind her back and then, without batting an eyelash, Sets her on the street and changes the locks. Frankly, that doesn't seem Like it was a loving marriage before.", "I wouldn't throw my child and grandchild out because their sibling has a stick up their butt about what happened in their marriage", "His mother's request is selfish. I didn't imply  that it wasn't\n\nI also said that she is aware that things are not going to change between her children. She is not asking either of them to reestablish a relationship. She is longing for one dinner with both children. She asked. A simple \"No.\", or \"No, Mom\" would have sufficed. The OP is obviously hurt and angry. He feels betrayed by his sister and by his parents because they took his sister in to the family home.\n\nWhile the OP claims his sister received an equal share of the marital property at the conclusion of her divorce, she and her child were out on the street when she returned to her home to find her belongings. outside.\n\nI'm not criticizing the OP, and I won't. We do not have a timeline on how long the process took.We do not know what expenses and/or bills his sister has incurred. \n\nI have no idea why her parents are \"sheltering her from the consequences of her actions\". They didn't contribute to the post. Perhaps she had a mental breakdown? Perhaps her behavior was caused by an an addiction or mental illness that  the OP, her former husband, or anyone else was aware of. Perhaps a trauma reaction? Perhaps something that doesn't seem like a big deal to you, or me.  Perhaps she receiving treatment. Perhaps the grandparents feel that it is best/ safest environment for the child right now. I don't know. Neither do you. The OPs parents aren't here to ask.\n\nIt is obvious that my reply seems odd to you. My mother has children who are estranged. Have been for many years. .(Not the same circumstances.) My perspective is different", "What?! Lmao. Are you seriously implying that a non-asshole would take out their anger on a toddler if they had a relationship with him?! Tell me you\u2019re really bad at making jokes.", "NTA for not wanting to go. If you don\u2019t want to have a relationship with your sister because she cheated and lied fine.  \nBut you should hold her bf to the same standard. From your post it seemed the bf knew for a while but only told when there was something in it  for her (your bil). So for that reason your a hypocrite.", "Or, maybe husband was spending too much time with the guys.   Or at work.  Or generally ignoring her.   Or drunk.  Or maybe her friends were going clubbing and she willingly went along.   Or maybe she was slipped a roofie by a guy.   Or maybe her minister seduced her.  OP should get the other side of the story.", "She could have been drugged and raped, but who gives a fuck.  Am I right, bro?", "It doesn't seem like he was close to his nephew. From how the post was written, I would not be surprised if OP was worried about not letting his emotions get the better of him around his sister. Kids will pick up on body and facial language, even if nothing is said. He might not want to expose the kid to his distaste for his mother, especially not at an age where he cannot understand what his mother did.", "Just because someone you're related to pops out a kid doesn't mean you're obligated to have a relationship with them.", "If you crumple up a piece of paper and throw it in the trash, did you lose it?", "> She lost her marriage. She lost her husband. She lost the love of her life.\n\nIt's not exactly \"losing\" when you cheat.\n\nHonestly, I dunno why it's such an important hill for OP to die on either, and yeah sis' life is probably punishment enough, but it's a pretty direct line from her actions to her current situation.", "I'm with you for the most part. I mean, she threw away her marriage, so that's on her. But people judge these things as if they are simple black and white scenarios. Life isn't that simple.", "Yeah, I don't think you fuck around on \"the love of your life\".  She lost someone she obviously didn't respect and a meal ticket who she was tricking into inadvertently raising her kid as his own.  She's lucky he doesn't sue the shit outta her for money he spent on the kid since she knew it wasn't his to begin with.  That's straight up financial abuse.\n\nEdit for typo", "Pretty much. Even without a lease/legal agreement, in most places it is illegal to evict an established resident without notice and cause. It varies by location but typically, around 2-3 months residency qualifies someone for that  protection. And kids usually have additional protections on top of that. Depending on what country they live in, and if BIL is on the birth certificate, denying the son shelter/support could be considered criminal neglect.", "You can\u2019t kick someone out of a home that their name is on. One of OP\u2019s comments says the sister was paid out for her half of the house meaning she did indeed have legal ties to the home. Changing the locks and putting their stuff out with no warning is a big no-no.", "The kid would have been around 2 at the time. He had no clue what was happening, and couldn't have understood if it was explained. Nor will he remember it. I doubt he would have been traumatized by the note on the door, or moving to the grandparents. He probably missed his Dad though.", "Sorry, explain please.   Are you saying that a woman who not only cheated on her husband but tried to pass her affair baby off on his was on the \"straight and narrow\"", "The brother-in-law IS still around, she didn't destroy him. The poster is still friends with him, just because they aren't related by blood does not mean he isn't family, and didn't deserve basic decency.\n\nThe poster is allowed to choose to support the family member who was wronged rather than the person who wronged. The ugly family dynamic already exists with the parents completely supporting their child having an affair and lying to their spouse for years, and are now trying to leverage the child in the middle of this situation to force people into contact with someone who has no morals. The messy situation is the fact that the grandparents and the mother do not love the kid and are using the kid as a pawn and isolating him from family who don't support the mother's right to cheat on her spouses and lie about the paternity of her child", ">Not to mention the child labor and poisoning of entire villages that make it possible for you to use a smart phone. Is that exactly moral? You condone that\n\nTop tier whataboutism.", "You sound stupid", "He said in another comment that exBIL is now dating the friend that exposed his sister", "Agreed, met my bio dad just a couple years ago for the first time.  I\u2019m 40.  It didn\u2019t go well.", "She didn\u2019t crumple up a piece of paper. She got a second piece of paper and hid it. The first one found the second paper and ran away.", "yeah losing and willingly giving them up with your own behavior are 2 different things \ud83d\udc80 idk anyone who can say they cheated on the \u201clove of their life,\u201d had a baby they knew wasn\u2019t theirs and had them raise it anyway \ud83d\udc80", "I'm with you up to the point where she was knowingly having him raise her offspring as his own child.   That's where it crosses the line from \"eh, shit happens\" to \"really fucked up\" territory.", "Oh shit! That's a really good point.", "Kids start forming long term memories around 2, typically starting with memories of how they felt during events with strong emotions. The note he won't remember, sure, but a sudden loss of your most familiar space is certainly enough to traumatize a child, and he absolutely could remember that. \n\nRegardless, it's heartless (and again, illegal) to suddenly throw out a kid you've been raising and considered your own for 2 years, no matter how you spin it.", "You\u2019re right. She should have another plan. She should have moved out on her own and found a place for her and her son. But she didn\u2019t. So they are taking care of her so the grandson can be safe. But at the end of the day if my sibling was living at (our parents) home with her kids I wouldn\u2019t care. Why? Bc that\u2019s a decision my parents made. If she slept with half the army base...I wouldn\u2019t care. Why? Bc it\u2019s not my body and it\u2019s not my business. I don\u2019t see what OP has to be upset about to the point of NC. It makes zero sense to me. His parents are adults. His sister is living with her mistakes. She did nothing to him.", "That\u2019s probably exactly what the friend wanted when exposing her lol", "Really sorry to hear that. I have a similar situation within my family and it\u2019s tough to navigate.", "That's fine that you feel you wouldn't care what your siblings do, but this isn't about you, and OP feels the way he does because his feelings are valid. Doesn't matter if you don't get it.", "Bc he was brought up a certain way by religious parents and all of those punishments went out the window asa Bailey turned out to be not so Christian after all. It\u2019s hard to get over everything your parents pounded into your head when your sister gets to be a fuck up with no consequences", "Her intentions were not selfless", "kinda stupid that the BIL fell for that. Like yeah I knew your son wasn\u2019t your son for 2 years but now I want to fuck you so now I\u2019ll tell you. And he ate it right up.", "Honestly, he might even be doing it out of spite just because it was the best friend. If not and he truly is trying a relationship with her then he may not be starting a healthy relationship.", "Because you can't trust a person who built a life on a lie at other people's expense?", "Well I do differ from the OP that I didn't cut my parents off for forgiving my sibling.  That's their choice.  I think for most people, a familial relationship isn't so easily tossed aside. I sympathize with OP's parents.  What are they supposed to do? I'm sure they still love their daughter,  even if they disapprove of her actions. Her child is still their grandchild.  How can they cut them off?\n\nMy guess is OP's parents want things to go back to how they were,  with both of their children attending holidays together. It's not about the daughter really. \n\nAs for me,  I've said this to my parents - I wish I could get over what my sibling did.  I just can't.  Not until they acknowledge the hurt they caused and apologize to the offended parties. But I miss my sibling and how our relationship use to be. That's why I'm \"invested\""]}
