This has rocked the entire family and we're all still putting the pieces back together. To know him was to love him, which means there is a large group of family, friends, and community members in mourning for him right now. That also means a huge support system for all those involved. Still, I feel like this is a decision I have to make totally by myself as it affects his legacy and how he's remembered.\n\nMy son came to me about last month saying he was considering breaking his engagement. After high school, he chose to travel with two of his friends, one of whom would end up becoming his fianc\u00e9e. Prior to this, he was dating a young man who he called his best friend up until the day he passed. They ended things amicably when my son chose to travel and his friend chose to stay behind to begin working. This friend is like a son to me and another brother to my daughter. When my son said he was thinking of breaking his engagement, he expressed that he regretted traveling and wished he had stuck around. He and his friend sat down and had a conversation about what life looked like for them moving forward, and he saw the future he wanted. So, he began getting his ducks in a row to make a clean break.\n\nTo my knowledge, he never got the chance to speak to his fianc\u00e9e about this. She has continually been asking if I'm open to sharing his ashes, and I've put it off by saying I can't handle the thought while I'm grieving. This is a lie, as I have already split the ashes with his sister and his best friend. I just can't in good conscience send part of him off to be with the woman he was planning on leaving. So finally, I said a flat out no. She has been pushing me for an explanation ever since.\n\nSo here's the dilemma. I can't decide if I should tell her the truth about why, which would likely make her grieving process even more complicated, or if I should keep it to myself and just claim it was a decision purely based on my feelings. I'm okay with playing the asshole in option two if it means my son gets to rest easily with people he loves.\n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1681942723, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12scbv2/wibta_if_i_didnt_give_my_late_sons_exfianc\u00e9e_an/", "score": 72, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your son, after all, didn't actually break it off with her. He just talked to you about it. You have no idea what would have happened if he hadn't tragically died. Let her alone, don't put this information on her plate, and let her grieve.\n\nI do not think that it is fair for you to use this information to withhold any of his belongings from his ex-fiancee. In fact, although I understand why you're doing it, I find it a bit cruel. It really doesn't sound like anything truly nefarious happened in their relationship, does it? Your son was just in love with someone else. He isn't here to end things on his own terms, that's true. But do you really think you're doing what he would want you to do? I am wondering if there is some other reason you aren't being honest about, why you don't want his ex-fiancee to get any of his items.", "I'm very sorry to read about your loss.\n\nI agree with what others have said.

Just make sure she does have something of his to keep.", "NTA, based on the title I think? \n\nLook, as far as she is aware, she and your son were in love and getting married.

If she continues to press for it, tell her that you are not going to be able to offer an explanation that makes any sense or brings her any comfort. \n\nIf it were me, I\u2019d probably go buy her a necklace with his birthstone on it, send it to her and include a note that says you want her to be able to keep her memories with him close to her heart so you purchased this necklace with his birthstone on it for her to wear. \n\nRemember that she loves your son too. She is grieving too. She was still planning to spend the rest of her life with him.", "NAH. I have opinions I\u2019ll share but this is too complex and sad to call you, his ex-fianc\u00e9e, or anyone else an asshole.\n\nWhile your son\u2019s plan sounds like it would\u2019ve ended in him breaking it off, he didn\u2019t do it so his ex fianc\u00e9e feels like they would be married but for his death. To her, her future husband died and you\u2019re refusing to give her ashes.\n\nHis plans could also have changed. Your knowledge of the probable breakup is unfortunate because it\u2019s created understandable hesitancy for you to share with her but no reciprocal feelings by her to keep her distance.\n\nEven if there weren\u2019t a planned breakup there would still be reasonable limits to what you shared. But the only thing you\u2019ve mentioned are his ashes. It seems like the thing about the ashes that makes them meaningful is the connection with your son they bring to their holder. I don\u2019t think the ash holders would be considering or even aware of the fractions/quantities etc. of ashes they versus others have. \n\nI don\u2019t know exactly where this leaves you. It sounds like re-dividing his ashes could be painful or impracticable. And while not sharing his breakup plans was a kindness up to now, the benefit of that kindness is going to be greatly diminished if the ex fianc\u00e9e (understandably) continues to reach out and you (understandably) don\u2019t give her any more information. So if you\u2019re dead set on refusing to engage with her, that might warrant explaining why as gently as you can.\n\nOr you can tell one of a few possible white lies that you allude to at the end. Were floored by grief when dividing ashes but can\u2019t undo that decision now, it\u2019s too painful, etc.\n\nBut, as I said earlier, she still thinks she lost her future husband.

I understand feeling a little uncomfortable knowing what you know, but at the end of the day - he was still engaged to her when he died, and withholding ashes from his fianc\u00e9e is a bit cruel. I doubt your son would want this.", "OP, if you read just one comment, please let it be this as it is the most complete and concise answer you should be considering.\n\nBased on your title, You will STILL be the A H. If in the end you decide not to share your son's ashes, YWBTA if you didn't offer any of his other belongings for his fianc\u00e9e to keep to help her grieve her loss and get through this.\n\nI also wanted to add that I believe Y W B T A too if you shared the private conversation you had with your son about his intentions. As hard as it is to accept, those ended when he died, and you shouldn't and mustn't assume anything based solely on that. Again, please note the top commenter's point on viewing it from your son's perspective now that he has passed. Would he want to inflict more pain to his fianc\u00e9e and allow her to grieve more than she is now?\n\nMy deepest condolences to you, and I'm sorry you have to deal with this on top of your loss.", "Better still, Mom could buy the necklace (they're not terribly expensive), put the ashes in it, and gift it to son's fiancee.", "This is the answer", "Yeah but then she's stuck with that knowledge questioning everything she thought she knew about her life, about him, and no way to get answers about how he reallt felt.\n\nShes already lost what she thought was her life partner. Why would you put this on her? And its not a choice when you don't know what you're choosing until you don't have the choice to choose.  In other words, no takesie backsies once she knows. Most people would say yes I want to know this extra info especially when people have been acting so weird.", "Imagine walking around for the next 60 years with a vial of ashes only to somehow find out you've been walking around with burnt trees or dirt.  Oof. I like your creativity though", "I actually think this is the kindest response of the lot.\n\nFiancee's was envisioning spending the rest of her life with this person, and that's suddenly gone. Her MIL has gone cold without reason, when she would have been part of that family in different circumstances (as far as she was aware).\n\nSubtext in this is that OP clearly loves the high school sweetheart (like a son/like a brother to the family), so is playing favourites as doesn't know the fiancee that well.\n\nAppreciate grieving makes it very hard to give a shit about how anyone else is feeling, but this sounds more like an excuse to be mean to fiancee.\n\nGet some random ashes, give a decent amount to the ex-fiancee, and set her free.", "Uh, based on what?", "Yeah I don\u2019t love this. I know parents support their children and also that coming to terms with your sexuality is complex and stressful. I know that this is an awful time and OP is grieving and I hope she has a lot of great support to get through this. \n\nI also know that there were at least a couple of weeks in which the son was telling other people he was considering ending his engagement and his fianc\u00e9 wasn\u2019t aware. That\u2019s a cruel, shitty move and he was cruel and shitty to her. His untimely death doesn\u2019t change that.", "Depending on the type of relationship they had, he could have gone to mom and used her as a sounding board.  Someone who would listen and help him work out his thoughts and feelings.  It's a big part of what parents of adults are for.  Him not telling fiancee isn't on mom. His decisions and actions were his.  But this has left mom in a horrible position.", "I understand this POV and that it comes from a place of compassion, but to my point of view, you would be asking her to survive her grief by running into the arms of a lie. The things that don't make sense to her now might never make sense, because they can't. She'd forever enshrine something in her memory that never existed. Without the right to be angry, or understanding, of what was actually going on.\n\nThis story is really sad already, but that idea makes me even sadder to think about.", "Again I\u2019m not trying to be a dick but the choice is between being an ahole and saying \u201cno\u201d, telling her the truth and devastating her in a way that is so complicated she might never fully recover, or make everyone happy by just burning some wood and a little white lie.", "Based on that fact that she\u2019s calling this woman his \u201cex fianc\u00e9\u201d when they didn\u2019t end their relationship. And she presumably didn\u2019t tell her son \u201cyour fianc\u00e9 deserves to know immediately that you are having second thoughts about your relationship\u201d. And finally because she cares more about the philosophical resting happiness of her son than the tangible, real life happiness of the woman he, at one point, loved and wanted to marry.", "Just my opinion but i feel like fiance probably knew about the sexuality. I mean he dated a man before he dated her, so hes not necessarily figuring that bit out. And discussing something like breaking off a serious relationship with a trusted parent isnt a bad thing, its a huge decision, and u shouldn't deal with important decisions like that alone. I do agree he shouldve communicated more with his fiance and he might've if he got the chance, but considering he didnt have any options since he died so suddenly i dont feel there is enough info to call him cruel. Again all my personal opinion.\n\nAs for OP themself i say just give the fiance a small necklace with a bottle of ashes in it. He was considering breaking an engagement but that doesn't mean he hated her.", "also need more Info...and does anyone think there is anyway telling her this in a kind and caring way could actually help her move on?  She wouldn't have to live grieving the life they were supposed to bc it wasn't going to happen if he lived.", "It's a very noble notion, but I'm not sure much would be gained.  It doesn't sound like there will be any continued relationship between her and the family, so I'm still in the camp of ignorance is bliss.\n\nVery well reasoned out though.", "For sure. That's understandable.  It's a tough decision but if OP truly doesn't want to split his ashes with her, this is an option.  Not a perfect one by any means.  But,  an option", "Right? That she won\u2019t give even a few ashes to the woman her son was engaged to. Regardless of what the future held, they were engaged when her fianc\u00e9 died. OP is being a raging AH.", "I want to follow up with the fact that I know grieving is complex and awful and also that obviously she\u2019s not in control of what her son did or didn\u2019t do. She\u2019s not at fault for his actions or lack thereof. But there is zero reason beyond \u201cI don\u2019t want to\u201d to not give her any of his ashes in my mind and that\u2019s cruel to her. OP said she\u2019s fine with being TA in that situation so okay. That\u2019s great and I wish you a lifetime of support and care in recovering from her sons untimely passing.", "My sister died last fall, so I\u2019ve been close to this situation. Everyone is grieving\u2026my mom, her kids, me. I didn\u2019t even think about the possibility of us being inconsiderate to each other during this difficult time. I can\u2019t help but think this is OP\u2019s personality peaking through during a very difficult time."]}
