I have bought 4 different dresses (excessive I know but I couldn\u2019t decide), new shoes, bag and accessories, all just for this wedding. I was excited to celebrate the day with friends, and more selfishly, it was going to be my first time away from my young daughter. I love my daughter, but I was enjoying the thought of not being solely at her beck and call for a couple of days. \n\nMy daughter has been ill since last week, she has had a fever, not eating and drinking and developed a rash and blisters on her hands, feet and mouth. Yesterday I also became ill, starting with an incredibly sore through and headaches and has developed into a fever and also blisters on my hands. I got an appointment with the local pharmacist and they confirmed that we both have hand, foot and mouth which is highly contagious and was advised to have as little contact with others as possible until over the infectious period which can be 7-10 days. \n\nYesterday I messaged my friend advising her of the situation and stating that I would not be able to attend the wedding, which I am really disappointed about. I also have messaged her sister (the bride) and explained and apologised also, and have stated that I\u2019m happy to pay if they are out of pocket due to my absence. \n\nMy friend has messaged me back today basically saying that IATA for it being so short notice, that there\u2019s nothing they can do now and they can\u2019t invite someone else and that she\u2019s incredibly disappointed in me and doesn\u2019t have words for me right now. \n\nOn top of feeling physically s**t from being ill, I now feel like a complete d**k and feel really s****y. \n\nI understand it\u2019s infuriating because it\u2019s so last minute and I would be a little pissed too if it was me, but it\u2019s not intentional and it\u2019s out with my control. I\u2019ve done my best in the situation by offering to financially reimburse the bride so I don\u2019t really know what else to do. AITA?\n\nI\u2019ll add in an Edit: The bride has not messaged me at all, and is not the one that is verbalising discontent, it\u2019s my friend that is doing this. However neither the bride or my friend have replied to my latest messages which I am presuming (as my friend read my message yesterday without replying and only replied today) is them ignoring me as they have been online.\n\nEdit 2: I did initially have my daughter seen last week when she initially became ill and had a fever etc, however they told me she was just teething, which, coincidentally she is. I then further took her back this week when she developed her rash and blisters. Whilst there I expressed that I too was ill and was diagnosed with HFAM also.", "created_utc": 1694004869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16bjk0p/aita_for_not_attending_my_friends_wedding_at_the/", "score": 424, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No. \n\nNTA, but your friend certainly is.", "NTA. They obviously don\u2019t understand the realities of HFM disease.

The alternative is showing up to a large event and spreading disease.  Once again I need to trot out -- \n\nHAVE THESE PEOPLE BEEN LIVING UNDER A ROCK FOR THE LAST 3+ YEARS?  THEY ARE ANOTHER EXAMPLE THAT INDICATES WE DON'T DESERVE TO SURVIVE AS A SPECIES.", "NTA whatsoever. You would only be an asshole if you went to the wedding and spread this around. I hope you feel better soon.", "NTA - But your friend totally is. The only way you would be the AH in this situation, is if you did attend the wedding knowing you were exposing everyone there. People who get mad at others for getting sick are the absolute worst.", "NTA\n\nDon't you book your illnesses in advance like she does?", "Oh yikes, you are seven levels of NTA! You absolutely have to isolate with an infectious condition and the chances of you infecting others if you go are huge. \n\nYour friend is being immature here, and I hope she gets over herself pretty quick. Getting sick happens. It\u2019s disappointing but if you\u2019re sick you\u2019re sick and that\u2019s that. \n\nSomeone I know had a fall the day of a friend\u2019s wedding and couldn\u2019t attend because she was in A&E with a head injury. We tried to keep the details from the bride so she wouldn\u2019t worry (we just said she was ill and couldn\u2019t make it) but her first reaction was to give her prayers and good wishes for the injured person\u2019s recovery and make sure that she still got wedding favours etc. That\u2019s how you deal with someone having an unavoidable issue that means they miss a wedding.", "NTA\n\nYou would have been if you still went with a highly communicable disease. People need to accept that it is likely that a few wedding guests who planned on attending have a last minute problem that prevents them from doing so.", "Of course you\u2019re NTA\n\nI\u2019m sorry your friend responded that way.

They would not be mine based on just this incident.", "NTA. i think it's possible that she may think you're making this up because you really don't want to go or don't want to leave your baby. of course she's still TA, but i think the reason she's acting like this is probably because she thinks you're lying about being sick.", "NTA. Illness is unexpected. I can\u2019t believe they\u2019d rather have you attend while you have HFM which is very contagious.", "Jeez. I had a relative all of a sudden day of decide she wasn\u2019t comfortable coming to my wedding (it was 2021) because of Covid concerns. I told her it was fine and it didn\u2019t bother me.

Tell her that you're saving her honeymoon experience. Imagine getting a hand job from a blistered hand.", "NTA- hand foot and mouth is EXTREMELY contagious. If you went to the wedding you would make a lot of people sick, even with stellar hygiene in place. You couldn\u2019t know a month in advance that you were going to get sick.

NTA  OP- you\u2019re doing the right thing and what any decent human being with an infectious disease should do.", "NTA- HFM is highly contagious, and not the wedding gift they\u2019d like.  Your not even in the party, so it\u2019s not a big deal if you miss it. Honestly if your friend is this upset  they are the bad friend your not.  Your doing the right thing", "NTA- I like to use public shaming when people upset me. Ok she's mad you're not coming? Make a big post online, tag everyone in it, and say you are so sorry you have to miss the wedding, but you would HATE to give everyone hfam. Ask the people to enjoy the wedding extra for you even. Surely they'd appreciate not getting infected, hope you and your kiddo feel better quick!", "The bride is an idiot.  NTA.", "NTA. You didn't try or plan to get a contagious disease, and had no control over the timing. \n\nI'm gonna hope that your friend's wedding stress is what was talking there, and cooler heads will prevail afterwards.

We planned a mini family vacation with mom, brother, neice, and myself.    Mom started feeling bad yesterday, and we took it easy at the motel.  This morning,  she's telling us to enjoy the day, but she's going to stay in bed.  \n\nBrother and I started packing everything up.  My three year old neice was extremely upset that we had to leave with doing all the fun things we had talked about.  However,  when we explained that granny was sick , she immediately stopped crying and went to see if Granny needed anything.   \n\nA three year old had a better response than the adults in this situation.  \n\nI'm almost fifty and I swear it's depressing when you realize 50% of all adults are selfish AF!", "WTF do they expect you to do?  That shit is highly contagious.  Would she prefer you come to the wedding like this & get everyone sick?  You are NTA.  There is absolutely nothing you can do.  You have HF&M disease & can't be around ppl.  You didn't go & get yourself sick on purpose.  Your friend is being a total fucking AH.  Is it really that much to ask for others to have a little empathy?  What kind of ppl are you friends with?  This person is not your friend.  To go & blame you for getting sick is ridiculous.", "My friend's toddler had it and she warned me. I'd never heard of it, but lo and behold, my daughter also caught it. We were declined attendance at toddler group because....IT'S CONTAGIOUS!!\n\nThe petty part of me would tag your friend and word it so uts obvious she wants you to still come, but you're staying home because you don't want to give the entire guest list a contagious disease.

NTA for cancelling but you should send a gift to cover your plate. You shouldn't ask if you should send money as it looks like you're trying to get out of it. The bride can't cancel your spot that close to the wedding. So yes it will cost them money if it's at a wedding venue. If you want to keep the relationship, I would send a nice gift and apologize again for having to cancel so close to the wedding. Your friend and the bride are probably so stressed right now.

It would be irresponsible of you to attend the wedding, because you will definitely spread your disease to multiple people, and worse case, some of the elderly attendees may have severe complications from it.
