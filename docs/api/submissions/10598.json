That's *you* overstepping.

Friend may have alternative motives for the name since she lied, but you didn\u2019t know that at the time. Where you might be TA is that your friend DID in fact try to get your reaction to the name.

I am assuming she lied about the reason for wanting that name because if it seemed \"more important\" on their end, it might hurt less on yours.\n\nYou are correct in that it isn't your business what she names her kid or why, generally speaking. However, she was trying to be a good friend and letting it be your business for the sake of the friendship. All you had to do was give her a straight answer that you were ok with it or not really ok with it. I hold the same opinion that what my friends name their kids is none of my business because it's THEIR kids - but I would feel so loved and respected in that situation to be thought of and would actually give an answer based on how I felt.

I think that you were vague with your answers to your ex-friend on purpose. You explained throughout the comments that your former friend is a liar and a manipulator. Yet, you never mention THAT as being an issue until later in the comments. It sounds as though you were willing to excuse her lying and manipulation, but God forbid she ask the same question. If you simply don't want to be her friend anymore, that's okay. But I think you were looking for a way to step away from this friendship in a way that wouldn't make YOU at fault.

That\u2019s almost a ten year age difference and it creates a distinct gap in maturity and life experience in learning how to manage difficult conversations. I\u2019m 39 and am a completely different person in re emotional maturity than when I was 29. All of which is to say, I\u2019m assuming best friend was \u2026 not immature, but less mature at age 29 (and now 32) than someone who was 38 (and now 41) and as such, I\u2019m cutting her a little slack on her poor handling of the matter. \n\nThat having been said, OP could have recognized that there was a more efficient way to respond to best friend than say yes or no. \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d is not yes, nor is it no. It\u2019s more like \u201cI refuse to take a position on this.\u201d  When my best friend asks me something of this magnitude, I feel that I do owe her - and myself - more than a shrug and more than a \u201cit\u2019s not my business,\u201d which is equally unhelpful.\n\nSo those are all non-answers. \n\n\u201cThis is a question I don\u2019t know how to answer because I can\u2019t figure out how I feel about it.  Can we talk through this together?\u201d is an answer. It\u2019s not a definitive yes or no, but it is a more dynamic response that instead of saying, in essence, \u201cI won\u2019t answer your question,\u201d is instead saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer, but you\u2019re my best friend, so I\u2019d like to talk to you about how I feel and hear what you are thinking and feeling.\u201d", "It was the name he had, there is inherently an association to him. Saying you can\u2019t tell her what to name her kid was irrelevant, she wasn\u2019t trying to get you to name her kid she was trying to know your opinion on a name to  determine if she felt comfortable naming him that. She was collecting information to make her own decision and yes other peoples opinions can factor into other peoples decisions. \n\nIt\u2019s like trying to decide what to have for your birthday dinner and asking if anyone in the group hates an option you were considering because part of what you want for your birthday dinner is for everyone to have a nice meal.  \n\nTelling her you didn\u2019t care if the kid had the same name as your brother would have been answering the question your indirect non answer was incredibly poor communication. She didn\u2019t accept your answer because again, it didn\u2019t answer the question she was genuinely asking it was answering a separate question you made up and put in her mouth.", "Even if OP genuinely doesn't care (I can't tell if she really doesn't or is just trying to convince herself she doesn't) she might not want to be responsible for it. \"My friend decided to pick this name, well it\u2019s not the end of the world I\u2019m fine\" is a bit different from \"my friend used this name because *I* told her to go ahead and do it.\" I think I\u2019d feel like I was giving up my right to ever feel sad or uncomfortable about it. \n\nAnd I\u2019d be annoyed that my friend was putting me in this position of responsibility for their baby name, knowing it was emotionally fraught.\n\nOP's friend may have meant well, and maybe some people in OP's position would appreciate her approach, but ultimately there are a million names out there. If she avoided this one...worst case scenario, she avoided it unnecessarily and her kid has a different, still perfectly fine name.", "Exactly. As long as you\u2019re not laying a trap (do what you want but if you choose wrong I\u2019ll punish you), you\u2019re fine!", "No, it would be like me saying \u201cI don\u2019t have veto power\u201d. Which is true and a perfectly valid answer. I don\u2019t want my friend to choose her wedding songs based on my preferences, and OP didn\u2019t want her friend to choose what to name her child based on her preferences.", "It ABSOLUTELY is an answer. People are allowed to not care about things. People are allowed to not express the opinion they do have. People are allowed to feel it\u2019s not their place to weigh in on something and be uncomfortable with the idea that someone might base a large personal decision based on their answer! I have been the person who has said these things and have had people think I was being passive aggressive or wishy washy and forced me to choose and I resent the hell out of those people and will not tolerate that treatment. You ask, I answer honestly. If you do not respect my answer or believe it, that is your problem. It is emotionally manipulative to insist on a certain type of answer to a question you weren\u2019t invited to ask in the first place! The asking of a question does not obligate another person to answer, much less yes/no.", "I don\u2019t care is a valid response. I don\u2019t know about in this particular instance but in general it is a valid response there are people who truly do not care or don\u2019t have an opinion on what was asked of them or about them. \nAlso maturity levels have nothing to do with age so saying you give her slack cause she\u2019s younger is in my opinion irrelevant because I have met people on their 60s who are immature and I have met people in their 20s who are very mature for their age. So age has no real bearing on someone\u2019s maturity level. \nAgain I\u2019m not saying about this particular instance because to me there is fault on both sides for how they communicated but we don\u2019t know what this other Friend wanted I mean it\u2019s all speculation as we do not know her or what she was thinking at the time we only know what op was thinking. This friend could have been just looking to not feel guilty as her other mom friends said she needed to ask so if she didn\u2019t get a yes then she would look bad so she pestered op to get a yes answer and when she didn\u2019t get that she just kept going. But to be fair I wouldn\u2019t get back in touch with this person not because of this specific situation but because op has expressed that she has lied multiple times and for me personally I dont like liars so after two lies I\u2019d be done with her. I give second chances but I don\u2019t give thirds", "She wasn't asking my opinion. She was asking for permission. Two very different things. I have no right to give anyone permission to name their kid what they want.", "Okay, so then I guess you and I won\u2019t be best friends \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\ude02\n\nAgree to disagree - takes all kinds to fill the freeway!"]}
