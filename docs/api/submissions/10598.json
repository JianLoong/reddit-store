Friend may have alternative motives for the name since she lied, but you didn\u2019t know that at the time. Where you might be TA is that your friend DID in fact try to get your reaction to the name.

I am assuming she lied about the reason for wanting that name because if it seemed \"more important\" on their end, it might hurt less on yours.\n\nYou are correct in that it isn't your business what she names her kid or why, generally speaking. However, she was trying to be a good friend and letting it be your business for the sake of the friendship. All you had to do was give her a straight answer that you were ok with it or not really ok with it. I hold the same opinion that what my friends name their kids is none of my business because it's THEIR kids - but I would feel so loved and respected in that situation to be thought of and would actually give an answer based on how I felt.

I think that you were vague with your answers to your ex-friend on purpose. You explained throughout the comments that your former friend is a liar and a manipulator. Yet, you never mention THAT as being an issue until later in the comments. It sounds as though you were willing to excuse her lying and manipulation, but God forbid she ask the same question. If you simply don't want to be her friend anymore, that's okay. But I think you were looking for a way to step away from this friendship in a way that wouldn't make YOU at fault.

I\u2019m 39 and am a completely different person in re emotional maturity than when I was 29. All of which is to say, I\u2019m assuming best friend was \u2026 not immature, but less mature at age 29 (and now 32) than someone who was 38 (and now 41) and as such, I\u2019m cutting her a little slack on her poor handling of the matter. \n\nThat having been said, OP could have recognized that there was a more efficient way to respond to best friend than say yes or no. \u201cI don\u2019t care\u201d is not yes, nor is it no. It\u2019s more like \u201cI refuse to take a position on this.\u201d  When my best friend asks me something of this magnitude, I feel that I do owe her - and myself - more than a shrug and more than a \u201cit\u2019s not my business,\u201d which is equally unhelpful.\n\nSo those are all non-answers. \n\n\u201cThis is a question I don\u2019t know how to answer because I can\u2019t figure out how I feel about it.  Can we talk through this together?\u201d is an answer. It\u2019s not a definitive yes or no, but it is a more dynamic response that instead of saying, in essence, \u201cI won\u2019t answer your question,\u201d is instead saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer, but you\u2019re my best friend, so I\u2019d like to talk to you about how I feel and hear what you are thinking and feeling.\u201d", "It was the name he had, there is inherently an association to him. Saying you can\u2019t tell her what to name her kid was irrelevant, she wasn\u2019t trying to get you to name her kid she was trying to know your opinion on a name to  determine if she felt comfortable naming him that. She was collecting information to make her own decision and yes other peoples opinions can factor into other peoples decisions. \n\nIt\u2019s like trying to decide what to have for your birthday dinner and asking if anyone in the group hates an option you were considering because part of what you want for your birthday dinner is for everyone to have a nice meal.  \n\nTelling her you didn\u2019t care if the kid had the same name as your brother would have been answering the question your indirect non answer was incredibly poor communication. She didn\u2019t accept your answer because again, it didn\u2019t answer the question she was genuinely asking it was answering a separate question you made up and put in her mouth.", "Even if OP genuinely doesn't care (I can't tell if she really doesn't?) she might not want to be responsible for it. \"My friend decided to pick this name, well whatever\" is a bit different from \"my friend used this name because *I* told her to go ahead and do it.\" I think I\u2019d feel like I was giving up my right to ever feel sad or uncomfortable about it. \n\nAnd I\u2019d be annoyed that my friend was putting me in this position of responsibility for their baby name, knowing it was emotionally fraught.\n\nMaybe OP didn\u2019t want to be the designated gatekeeper for this name, didn\u2019t want to speak on behalf of all her other family members, and/or didn\u2019t want her friend to use \"OP approved of it\" as an answer to any mutual friends who questioned the decision. Regardless, OP clearly found the conversation upsetting.\n\nOP's friend may have meant well, and maybe some people in OP's position would appreciate her approach, but ultimately there are a million names out there. If she avoided this one...worst case scenario, she avoided it unnecessarily and her kid has a different, still perfectly fine name.", "Exactly.

People are allowed to feel it\u2019s not their place to weigh in on something and be uncomfortable with the idea that someone might base a large personal decision based on their answer! I have been the person who has said these things and have had people think I was being passive aggressive or wishy washy and forced me to choose and I resent the hell out of those people and will not tolerate that treatment. You ask, I answer honestly. If you do not respect my answer or believe it, that is your problem.

I don\u2019t know about in this particular instance but in general it is a valid response there are people who truly do not care or don\u2019t have an opinion on what was asked of them or about them. \nAlso maturity levels have nothing to do with age so saying you give her slack cause she\u2019s younger is in my opinion irrelevant because I have met people on their 60s who are immature and I have met people in their 20s who are very mature for their age. So age has no real bearing on someone\u2019s maturity level. \nAgain I\u2019m not saying about this particular instance because to me there is fault on both sides for how they communicated but we don\u2019t know what this other Friend wanted I mean it\u2019s all speculation as we do not know her or what she was thinking at the time we only know what op was thinking. This friend could have been just looking to not feel guilty as her other mom friends said she needed to ask so if she didn\u2019t get a yes then she would look bad so she pestered op to get a yes answer and when she didn\u2019t get that she just kept going.

But it places the burden on OP where there shouldn\u2019t be one.  Asking at first is OK but if she didn\u2019t respond positively the first time, stop asking.  It either means she genuinely doesn\u2019t care or she\u2019s bothered but values the friendship more.  In either case, if I were the friend, I\u2019d have picked a different name unless OP had seemed touched.  It also would have been fine to keep the name.  But stop asking.\n\n\nIt\u2019s the repeated asking and asking and bringing others into it.  Makes it feel like she thinks OP is wrong for not being bothered.  Let her feel how she feels and drop it.", "If they didn't want the pressure they could have straight up said that it did not bother them if the child was named that.  What don't you understand about THAT?", "Which is not what the friend was asking. Saying something is none of her business, is NOT the same thing as saying \"This doesn't bother me.\" There's lots of shit in how people raise their kids that are none of my business. I'm still judging them though.  So are you.  \n\nSo no, it's not a direct answer.", ">She says it's the only name they agree on. I say it's not my business.\n\nSounds like they didn't have an agreement after all!", "Well sounds like OP never actually said yes or no, just \u201cIt\u2019s not my business\u201d. Which to me is not an acceptable answer to a yes or no question. If you\u2019re ok or don\u2019t care, just say \u201cyes it\u2019s fine\u201d.\n\nI don\u2019t understand how this situation spiralled out of control when OP just had to say \u201cyeah sure\u201d\u2026", "I agree. I would have asked once, dropped it, and named the kid whatever I wanted. OP had a chance to engage and refused to do so. OP wouldn\u2019t even say \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She just flat out refused to provide meaningful input to a friend who was trying to take her feelings into consideration. At that point, OP loses the right to be involved and should not be upset no matter the name. Her friend should stop asking since no real conversation is going to come of it.\n\nThat said, if I was the OP, I would have just said I didn\u2019t care. Both parties could have made this easier.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not my say\u201d is a direct answer. And after asking twice and getting the same response, the friend should\u2019ve just left it at that. OP doesn\u2019t owe her an answer tailored to her liking. Neither does OP\u2019s family (seriously why the fuck would she ask OP to bring that up to her siblings? That\u2019s fucking cruel). The friend should\u2019ve behaved like an adult and accepted the answer she received. Instead she kept harassing someone who was likely grieving because she\u2019s fucking unhinged.", "I think there are also people out there who freak out if the group separates for any reason.  It's like they are human guinea pigs or something, wheek-wheeking together and panicking if one of them strays from the piggy train.\n\nGroupthink like that is bizarre.", "Thats why i made the flippant comment aswell. \n\nOP has decided to come to reddit to tell her if her friendship is worth preserving rather than... you know... asking her friend what her deal is... like it is so hard. \n\nBut no, us lot who have no context for their relationship will know better if she should take her friend back. LOL just talk to each other damnit", ">Why isn\u2019t \u201cI do not care and I do not feel it\u2019s my place to tell you what to do\u201d not a real answer? \n\nExcept I don't see where OP said \"I do not care\" to her friend.  If she had included that, it might have been different because that *is* an answer.  But according to the post, OP only said to her friend \"It's not my place.  I don't have veto power.\"", "Just because she wants it doesn't mean she's entitled to it."]}
