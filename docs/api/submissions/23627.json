But last minute his college friend offered to stay over the full duration to take care of our 2 boys. She was dealing with a breakup and needed some change of space as well.\n\nI\u2019ve met her a few times and she genuinely seemed nice. My bf and I had a clear discussion about trust in this person. Everything seemed fine! We gave her all the information she needed to take care of the cats and to stay comfortably. I even reiterated that we\u2019re grateful that she\u2019s taking care of the cats\n\nBut throughout the whole trip, she sent 3 photos and wasn\u2019t really responsive until we had to explicitly ask for photos and updates over and over again! I was already a bit pissed.\n\nNow we\u2019re back, and the first look of the house is: \n- My expensive champagne bottle is empty\n- My personal expensive skin care products used from my bedside \n- My face masks used and hair brush broken\n- Trash cans in the bathroom filled with tampons \nAnd this is just the first few hours that I\u2019ve noticed.\n\nPlan to talk to bf today, but I don\u2019t think he values these things, so he might ask me to let it go. I can\u2019t stop feeling pissed though and I also don\u2019t know what to do about it!\n\nThanks!\n\nEdit:\nWe had shown her the basic amenities of the house like utensils, silverware, coffee, pantry supplies so that she didn\u2019t have to buy tomatoes and stuff. You know for courtesy and helping a friend out through a breakup. We didn\u2019t go into details of what not to use cuz we implied that being respectful of other\u2019s belongings and space is common sense.

Do you want her to reimburse you for stuff used and broken. Reasonable but the kind of asshole who did this isn't going to be forthcoming with paying for it so is it worth the stress.\n\nAlso your boyfriend should value things because you do. But I'm going to give some benefit of the doubt and assume you mean he doesn't know make up is expensive. In which case just say X dollars of make up stolen. But still kinda a red flag your anxious to raise valid concerns with him.\n\nDefinitely worth bringing up so he knows now to not use her again. But I don't know what purpose confronting her serves. But maybe I'm a wuss or something.", "NTA. If it was just the champagne and using the trash cans for her sanitary products that would be fine/a miscommunication but the face masks and skincare products are crossing a line.", "well what were the exact terms you communicated to her? not between you and your BF \n\nINFO ?", "You\u2019re right! We asked to send photos often (leaves it open ended). And then it was us asking over messages every other day. But received it only thrice. I see room to be explicit and say \u201cPlease send us some photos and a quick update every two days\u201d That would have been the best", "NTA\n\n> common sense\n\nThere's nothing common about common sense.  I swear, some people are just [insert expletive.]", "NTA\n\n\nI'd be reaching out to see how her stay went. Then I'd ask \"so what happened? There must have been a reason you drank our champagne, and used up my personal products.\"\n\n\n\nHave you paid her already? Send her an invoice for the products and Champagne. It might seem petty but there is no reason for her to have helped herself to your stuff.", "NTA, but give your bf a 'bill' for the used stuff so he can replace what his friend used/broke.  As long as he doesn't think this is a big deal, great.", "There's no real conflict here. Are Y T A for being pissed that someone drank your champagne and used your expensive stuff? No, of course not but you should probably post this after you've spoken to your boyfriend and the colleague.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Ideally in a world where i don\u2019t have confrontation issues, I\u2019d keep the communication open and say, \u201cHey, that champagne was expensive and for our anniversary. Just wanted to let you know\u201d I\u2019m a people pleaser, so it\u2019s hard for me. I guess standing up for myself is the end goal. As for the cosmetics, I saved up money to buy it for self care during xmas. It was in my bedside tucked away. I can let that go! It\u2019s just a matter of principle, you don\u2019t touch other\u2019s stuff. As women, we clearly know how much things cost in skin care and you don\u2019t break hairbrushes! I guess you\u2019re right, i can prevent future interactions, but not much to do here! I talk to bf and set boundaries.", "We had shown her the basic amenities of the house like utensils, silverware, coffee, pantry supplies so that she didn\u2019t have to buy tomatoes and stuff.

Having said that If you said something like make yourself at home, the Champaign might be a grey area but definitely not make up she had to snoop in a drawer for.\n\nI just wanted to comment that it's gonna be a pain in the ass that unless you go to small claims court for I don't see her paying for.\n\nHaving said all of that, I have rethought a little and do think you or your bf calling her out and possibly demanding money accepting that you probably won't get it is reasonable catharsis and has some community value in telling her stuff isn't acceptable.", "Hmmm I would say small Y T A for being pissed about the updates unless you explicitly specified how often you want an update before you left. \n\nShe is a big AH for raiding your stuff like that, the champagne could've been an honest mistake, but if you say the cosmetics were tucked inside that's a completely different matter ... and what about the brush? that's just crazy, how do you go around breaking a brush of somebody else's?\n\nI think you should ask her to reimburse you for the brush and champagne at least. Next time just stick with the sitter and some good old contract-based relationship.", "Next time I'm at your house, I'm grabbing the good bottle.\n\n Hey! You said to help yourself!", "I mean yeah, but still you know she was told to help herself with things from the pantry so misunderstanding's possible there... As for me, nope thank you, not a fan of housesitting in general."]}
