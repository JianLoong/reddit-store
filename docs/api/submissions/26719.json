Don\u2019t be offended but Jmo I\u2019ll say as nicely as I can to not offend my deceased mother, it sounds like your mom is way way over sensitive, too in your business and a bit paranoid. It\u2019s weird she asked that. Families can have their weirdness so it\u2019s not the worst I\u2019ve heard but I was like what? Lol", "Tell her you were touching yourself, then tell her you'll clean that guest towel later on once you're done with it.", "Ofc no xd\nIt's quite normal to have your own privacy", "NTA.", "This reminds me of when my cousin & I were entering puberty & my grandmother was obsessed with us growing body hair. My cousin had fallen asleep on the couch & she began inspecting his armpits. She then began asking my mother about whether I had started growing body hair.", "NTA. You are no longer a 6-8 yo who she should monitor closely. Here's a tactic. FYI: I live in Florida, US.\n\nMy husband sometimes asks me ridiculous question. For example, I will get up during the night, in my nightgown, and head to the bathroom.  My darling husband will ask 'Where are you going?\" I finally started saying \"Nebraska.\" \n\nI figure a silly question deserves a silly response.  It certainly stops the conversation. \n\nNext time reply to your mom \"I was too busy petting the giraffe.\" or something equally stupid.", "NTA\n\nYour mom needs to mind her own.", "NTA\n\nShe was being very uncomfortable and intrusive", "NTA.  I'm torn between WTF and your mother is a sicko.  I would have told her I brought finger lady vibrator and had a good ruboff...WTF?", "Your initial response was spot on.  But you asked a rhetorical question, aand it would have been weird if she had responded.  \n\nI see both sides.  As a daughter of a woman with no filter, I feel your pain.  (My mother is in her 80s, and no, it never got better.) As a mother with adult children, I see her side too.  When I look at my children, I see both the person they are now and the baby who held in my arms. Whenever they st another boundary with me that solidifies the notion that they are adults, I find myself grieving anew.  And then a few days or months later they come to me and want me to do something I use to do when they were young, and it is really confusing.  Frankly, I don\u2019t think this boundary business is something I will ever excel at.", "NTA", "My mom asked this before. \"you were in there so long, what were you doing?\"\n\nA. \"Taking a shit, mom\"\n\nB. \"Rockin a piss\"\n\nC. \"Poaching pheasants what the fuck do you think\"\n\nLately I've gone with C", "NTA. This is weird. I have a 4 year old and I feel weird having to ask if he\u2019s pooping every time he goes to the bathroom (because he\u2019s not a great wiper yet, so I have to be around to assist). I cannot wait until I can stop asking \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude02", "Maybe make loud grunting and gasping noises and then splashes whilst you're in there \ud83d\ude02 she'll quickly learn not to listen", "When she asks 'Did you pee?', you could make a mysterious face and say 'Maybe?'\n\nOr something like 'Welcome to the Twilight Zone'\n\nYou could also reference X-Factor. Did it happen? Or did it not happen?", "Take a picture of a bowl movement and show it to her lol", "I mean... if mom's already holding a solo cup up to the door, I don't think any of these are gonna phase her.", "Wow, there seem to be a lot of parents that ask their adult children what they do in the bathroom.", "I love this! As moms we sometimes aren't thinking about kids being adults, even when you have grandchildren. So using humor is a good tactic.", "I was wondering the same.", "Probably to find out if she should be terrified or not", "My mom is the same way\u2014if any of my nieces take \u201ca while\u201d in a restroom she gets concerned (out of good intent) that there might be wrong. She\u2019ll usually say, \u201cI hope everything\u2019s ok\u2014I hope she\u2019s not sick/in a bad way\u201d but I chalk this up to her trying to relate their experiences yo her personal ones. She has had stomach/GI issues her whole life so she is sensitive to those concerns and kind of is primed to look out for that for anyone. Out of empathy and not noses-ness tho.", "Fight discomfort with discomfort.\n\nTell her \" no, I took a giant shit\", or  \" no, I just jerked off, I'm surprised you didn't hear me, it was a good one\".\n\nExtreme, but Usually only need to do this once.", "> she started freaking out saying that she feels like I'm always going to be offended by her and that she always does things to upset me\n\nI mean, DOES she always do things to upset/offend you? That feels like a really big reaction to one interaction so I'm wondering if this is a pattern. If it is, well, it's not about the bathroom, it's about your mom being nosy and dramatic.", "Next time she asks, tell her, \"I sat on the bog and played with my bean, Ma.\" She'll stop asking.", "I never understood why my mom spent so much time in the bathroom until I became a parent.", "Everytime I close my eyeesssss I wake up feeling so HORNNYYYT", "YTA, not for telling her not to ask what you do in the bathroom, that\u2019s perfectly reasonable, you didn\u2019t need to push the matter after she tried to change the subject. Your mom should be more careful about boundaries, but you should also be respectful about it.", "Even better since OP is a woman", "I don't have kids, but I have a cat and a husband.  Nope, no peace for me in the bathroom.", "Just wait, it won't be long before they are pushing stuff under the door, or trying to get the door open!", "My local CVS had a \"peeing alone\" tab on the Mother's Day cards. Not kidding.", "Ahh I see, it sounds more like prejudice then as if you are both white you are the same race, but yes she sounds like she was interpreting your accent (if you have one) and dyslexia as a sign of lacking intelligence and lacking ability to do your job, which is a shame. \n\nApologies for the outburst, a lot of people claim things are racist when they simply aren\u2019t, they are just normal unfairness like anyone else experiences.", "They already try, that's why I lock the door", "I used to get notes under the door when I was just trying to get away!"]}
