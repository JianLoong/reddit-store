{"id": 6765, "submission_id": "1060mmu", "title": "AITA for canceling my husbands kids phone lines?", "selftext": "I 23F, am married to 33M. He has 3 kids from a previous relationship and we have a 7M old baby. We have been together for 2 years, since I met him he has been giving his ex $1300 monthly for his kids. I have never intervened and even have sent the money myself when his ID was an issue. The problems started way before my child came in the picture. His ex would constantly talk about me and say really mean things when we were barely a month into our relationship. She has showed up to places we\u2019d go to and straight up embarrass us in public. They have been separated for 7 years. He has her blocked because she harasses him any chance she gets and he only communicates through his children which even then, she messages him through their phones to talk shit. I have never interacted with this woman until recently. My husband has a seasonal job , so the weather affects his work. Recently I have been the only one working and offered to pay his kids phone bill and even made sure they had a nice Christmas. So he explained to his ex that he is going to be short this month until he is able to work . That was the end of her world. She started bringing up my child and being bitter towards us saying we shouldn\u2019t have brought him into this world and that he is probably starving. Just so many F\u2019d up things. Remind you , his kids constantly were saying their mom left them to go out and didn\u2019t feed them. She does not work so she depends only on his money. Since we send the money biweekly she is already asking for more within the week. I have not gotten involved until she brought up my child this last time , since he is constantly the topic of her conversations. I told her to stop bringing him up we have nothing to do with it. She started calling me dumb for even paying his kids things and that she doesn\u2019t care what I do for their kids, what I do means nothing to her. So I canceled their lines because I refuse to be used by ungrateful people. Now his kid is messaging me calling me a bitch but they do not know the horrible things their mother had said about me and my child. So am I TA for canceling the lines that I pay for?\n\nEdit* of course there is much more to this story. \nI forgot to mention she told all his kids to message him and block him until he has the money to give them. She does not want to pay their phone bill, she does not want to put him on child support even tho he already told her to do that . She doesn\u2019t put her part in anything , just asks for money and even then sometimes tells him he should just keep the money because it\u2019s not enough.\n\nEdit # 2 Ok my apologies I literally suck at explaining shit and I left so much info . I don\u2019t mean he has a measly ass job where he gets paid minimum wage. What I mean by seasonal job is that he is a construction contractor, there are slow months due to the weather , we live in US but by the border of Canada , so the weather here is horrible. It gets up to -30\u00b0F. He is unable to complete his projects because it puts his safety at risk and the other employees. I\u2019m also not saying we have loads of money , enough to live comfortably and him pay for his dues . Times like this , money isn\u2019t coming in as quickly as it would in the spring summer fall where it is still safe to work. He is not completely out of work. His company is doing snow removals and any other side jobs that will bring money in until his normal work starts up . He has the money to give her , but it would be a one time payment every month and she does not want to accept the money that way. She wants it biweekly and he wanted to come to an agreement until March where he can proceed with the regular biweekly payments but she does not want it that way . They will get their money just not how she wants it . \nI have taken care of those kids like if they were my own. It was never personal with the kids . I do NOT send them money of my own because I made it very clear it is not my responsibility, I do not get in their business at all. I am only here to make sure he IS paying his child support (not court ordered). I am not some bitter wife that hates the ex . I genuinely care for those kids but their mother harasses us with those same phones I pay for and I never knew why! Kids age range from 13-15 (yes he had them very young) so they are old enough to understand the situation. I have never been bitter towards them and they have never been bitter towards my child . But when their mother wants drama and attention she will do anything to get, I did not give in until this last comment she made where I completely lost it. *I stay out of there business * my point is , she says nothing I do will be good enough and that I should just stop trying because they only make fun of me for trying to be nice to them , that in reality they don\u2019t even care what I do for them.

If you do not have proof of funds being transferred, you have no proof he paid.  Unless she has texted and said x amount is not enough, give me more sort of thing.

I don\u2019t think YTA because at some point things need to change even though there are children involved. \n\nIMO, I believe She doesn\u2019t want to take him to court because he might not have to pay that $1300 anymore. If you have the receipts of everything I would have him file for everything. Why do you need to wait for her to file? This will remove the \u201cfree will\u201d of money and force your hand on payments. There are few waivers she can get since she is not working.

Don't pay another cent & instead offer to take the kids off of her hands in writing through certified mail with return receipt requested to show she signed for the letter.

OP also said Mom leaves kids home alone so without a phone how can they call for help?", "No, that's not what I meant. I meant the father has the mother's number blocked. What if there's an emergency or other reason why she needs to reach the dad? They're co-parenting, that requires communication. If she harasses him, he might have to get legal advice, but blocking the number of your parenting partner sounds like a bad idea.", "You're punishing them for their mom's behavior. That's absolutely not respecting them at all.", "whats his opinion on this", "I think this is an underrated comment. She\u2019s singlehanded holding TWO families together right now. Only one is hers. How the hell did they exist before her?

It was very poor judgment and will only serve to drive a wedge between OP and hubbie - just what the ex wants.", "At the risk of getting downvoted, it's not OP's responsibility to pay, though. She was doing the dad a favor and got insulted for it. What she should've done is not pay for shit in the first place. Stay the fuck away from that shit show. Help the dad with a lawyer, get all that shit in written and don't even allow the mother to talk to you ever again. Everyone is using OP, both the parents and the kids who learned from them.

So he told me I have a right to react", "Ok my apologies I literally suck at explaining shit and I left so much info . I don\u2019t mean he has a measly ass job where he gets paid minimum wage. What I mean by seasonal job is that he is a construction contractor, there are slow months due to the weather , we live in US but by the border of Canada , so the weather here is horrible. It gets up to -30\u00b0F. He is unable to complete his projects because it puts his safety at risk and the other employees. I\u2019m also not saying we have loads of money , enough to live comfortably and him pay for his dues . Times like this , money isn\u2019t coming in as quickly as it would in the spring summer fall where it is still safe to work. He is not completely out of work. His company is doing snow removals and any other side jobs that will bring money in until his normal work starts up . He has the money to give her , but it would be a one time payment and she does not want to accept the money that way. She wants it biweekly and he wanted to come to an agreement until March where he can proceed with the regular biweekly payments but she does not want it that way . They will get their money just not how she wants it .", "Actually I thought I was wrong but I reread the post and it didn't make any sense when op wrote he works a seasonal job but pays 1300 a month for his kids and now she's paying the phones for the kids.

They don\u2019t\u2026 have working telephones? They aren\u2019t able to communicate as readily with their friends or other people they want to talk to? Are you seriously asking why it\u2019s a punishment to not have a working phone? \n\nThe only reason they\u2019re able to reach out now is assumably because of WIFI.
