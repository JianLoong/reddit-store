My dentist is located about 45 minutes from where my doctor is (relevant to the story).\n\nIt's also important to note that if you are even five minutes late for your doctor's appointment at this office, they won't see you. You have to be on time. This is common for most clinics though.\n\nI showed up for my doctor's appointment at 9:50am. I pay my copay, the medical assistant showed me back to a room, took my weight, BP, heart rate, and temperature, let me know my doctor would be in shortly, and closed the door.\n\nMy doctor is a good doctor and she's thorough and sometimes she goes over on her appointments. It's not uncommon for her to show up to the room 15 or 20 minutes late. It's not ideal, but I'm aware of it and tried to plan accordingly.\n\nI waited 45 minutes for her to come in, but she never did. As I said above, I had a dentist appointment, so I decided to leave. I tried to open the door, but the doorknob is broken. It turns, but the latch doesn't move. So I'm literally stuck in the room. I try the knob again, nothing. I tap on the door, and no one comes. I jiggle the knob, nothing. I knock on the door, no one hears. So, I try to get it to unlatch on my end by trying to push up on the knob and turn it at the same time, by trying to turn it quickly, and by trying to turn the knob while pulling the door towards me and also pushing it away from me. This made a lot of noise, and somebody started yelling at me to stop from the other side of the door. They opened the door, and there are four of the staff there looking at me like I'm unhinged. I apologized, said I had tried getting their attention by knocking but no one heard. All I got was \u201coh, we heard, we ALL heard, that was so unnecessary\u201d. Went to the front desk to ask for a refund for the copay since I wasn't seen, and they're all still looking at me like I'm some crazy person.\n\nI don't know. It was very embarrassing. Yes, I was irritated that I waited for so long and no one came. I feel like that's a normal and natural reaction to a situation like this. And this is a known issue with that doorknob. I've been trapped in that room before, but only for a minute. It needs to be fixed or replaced. Seems like a safety issue to me on top of everything else. And not just that, it's triggering for me to be locked in a room from the outside. But was I acting crazy or yelling or pounding on the door or trying to break it down? No. \n\nI don't know what I could have done differently. Wait a few more minutes? Try knocking louder? I'm embarrassed and angry now, and I tried to talk to them when I was there but I really had to get to my dentist appt and I feel like trying to go back and explain myself as just going to be weird and awkward\n\nSo yeah, AITA?", "created_utc": 1701720664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18at1ib/aita_for_trying_to_open_my_room_door_at_the/", "score": 512, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rude and dangerous behavior on their part.", "NTA.\n\nThis is entirely unacceptable for many reasons.\n\nFirst, anything beyond 10 minutes waiting needs to be addressed.  Patient time is every bit as important as provider time, and while emergencies happen the patient is entitled to be advised and to reschedule if necessary.  They ought to give you a refund AND apologize.\n\nSecond, it is a fire hazard to have rooms that you can't get out of, whether because they are locked or because the doorknob is faulty.  I would report that to the local fire marshal.\n\nFinally (and this assumes you are in the US), there is a regulatory agency where you can file complaints.  It is sometimes called a \"Facility Services Complaint\" or something similar.  I'd file a complaint.\n\nIt goes without saying that you will need to find a new primary care provider, but you were (hopefully) already going to do that.", "NTA\n\nThe door should open when you attempt to open it.\n\n\u201coh, we heard, we ALL heard, that was so unnecessary\u201d\n\nI would have read them the riot act.", "They left you trapped in a room and ignored your efforts to get help to get out?

They need to fix their shoddy office and stop acting like people are lunatics for wanting to leave (whether or not the doctor is 45 minutes late).

The broken door is certainly a safety hazard, and they do need to address that.  You were literally imprisoned against your will, and you could've been screaming your head off and beat the door off it's hinges and you would still be NTA.\n\nI for sure wouldn't have waited 45 minutes, though.  It's one of my personal pet peeves when I get left in a room waiting for someone to get around to seeing me.  I have a 10-minute rule, 10 minutes to get me to a room and 10 minutes until the doctor sees me.  If they go over, I politely go to the reception desk and re-schedule.", "NTA! What else were you supposed to do--And why is it \"unnecessary\" to try to get the assistance of people who can help you? Especially those who are SUPPOSED to care for your well being? \n\nAnd I know it's the \"norm\" to be kept waiting at a doctor's office--but it really bothers me when there's zero understanding or sympathy for the patient. We can't all just wait around all day, either.\n\nI would definitely call the office to discuss how crappy that experience was. And 100% that door needs to be fixed. You might also be able to write an email--that could help you compose your thoughts without feeling flustered by talking to the staff in person.", ">All I got was \u201coh, we heard, we ALL heard, that was so unnecessary\u201d.\n\nWTF?

Reading the original post I was shocked to see someone book appointments so close together in time, in my mind it was \u201cwow there\u2019s no way they could make it to both\u201d and then saw there was a 45min drive also & thought it must\u2019ve been a scheduling error. Then I made it to the comments and apparently everyone is saying they\u2019ve never waited more than 10 minutes and that a 15 minute wait is unacceptable/unheard of.

My personal record was 1.5 hours from the taking vitals to the actual exam, which lasted 20 minutes. The only real recourse is to find another doctor, and that will be an absolute PITA because so few take new patients, or your insurance, and your wait will be in months.

Sometimes my gynecologist is called away to deliver a baby. My dad's cardiologist was called away to a heart emergency at the hospital so my dad had to wait.

They will also give me the option to reschedule for later that week if I can't wait. And they apologize for the wait.  \nIn the USA I \\*finally\\* figured out the appointment with the shortest wait time. Schedule the last appointment before the staff has lunch. Because none of them wanted to miss their lunch break. It was better for me and better for my kids. Spending hours in a small waiting room with snotty kids was not my idea of a pleasant morning.   \nBad time management seems like a learned behaviour if it's so wide-spread amongst doctors in the USA.", "No I refuse to let doctors get away with that. How dare they? I also have other things happening that are important. If you cannot stick to your schedule, maybe you need a course in time management? If I were 45 minutes late for my appointment they would charge me a no-show fee. That is just garbage treatment and I just can\u2019t let that slide.", "Yeah. Her appointments are usually only about 15 or 20 minutes long. I thought I had given myself enough time for her to be late to my appointment, and then spend 15 or 20 minutes with me. I knew it was kind of close together, she's so hard to get in to see, and this was an urgent dental appointment. I see your point though.", "Well, I wouldn't say that I was panicking or anything. I do have a cracked filling, and my dentist was able to squeeze me into this appointment, so I really didn't want to miss it. If I had nowhere to go after my doctor's appointment, I honestly probably would have continued to just sit there. I probably wouldn't have even known that This was the room with the broken door knob. I really hate confrontation, so I try not to do things that rock the boat.", "Yeah, someone else mentioned that here. In hindsight, I should have just called them and asked to be let out.

Especially when you have a doctor that tends to go over on their appointments. It throws the whole schedule off, and becomes a nightmare with the coding.

Also bothers me that doctors offices with the strict lateness policies (can\u2019t be seen if you\u2019re 6 min late) don\u2019t uphold themselves to the same standards of timeliness.", "Inappropriate, dangerous and unprofessional. I would find a new doctor. That room should not be used if the door is broken to the point of locking people inside. It shouldn't have happened to you twice. \n\nIt is one of my pet peeves for doctor's who are never on time seeing their patients but will charge you a cancellation fee and refuse to see you if you are 30 seconds late. It's a two way street. Yes, don't blow off or be late to your appointment, but the doctor should have respect for your time too. \n\nThen they were rude to you about it? No thanks. Report them for the fire hazard and their unprofessionalism and go somewhere else.", "I would email them with a complaint personally. \n\nI recently had an unpleasant experience at a clinic. Despite waiting for 45 minutes to be seen, I was unable to leave as the door knob was broken. When I asked for help, no one responded until later, when I was scolded for my inconvenience. I find it necessary to address the inappropriate response of the staff for several reasons:\n\nIt raises serious concerns about the staff's ability to respond appropriately in the event of an emergency.\n\nIn the case of a medical emergency, prompt assistance may not be possible.\n\nBeing locked in a room without consent can cause extreme anxiety and prevent access to basic needs like using the restroom.\n\nThe staff's response was unacceptable for a medical facility, as they failed their duty of care to me as a patient. \n\nI appreciate your attention to this matter and hope that the door will be fixed promptly to prevent similar problems in the future.", "Yeah nah. If you were having an emergency you could have died. Locking you in there, ignoring you knocking, making you wait so long when they will cancel and charge you if you are 5 minutes late?

I wasn\u2019t locked in a room but waited for a doctor 55 minutes. Got up and went out and told the nurse I was leaving. My time is as important as the doctors. I walked out. The doctor\u2019s wife who is another nurse there called me within 10 minutes and apologized. That was 3 years ago. I\u2019m sure something was written in the notes because it hasn\u2019t happened again. I\u2019ve had to wait 20 minutes at the most.

They are usually very good about respecting my time, so the 20 minutes isn't so bad.  I decided on that rule after my last not-so-respectful doctor's office left me waiting an hour plus at a time.

I will not pay if I'm not seen.", "I usually give myself more time too. The tooth thing was urgent, and it was their first available appointment to see me.
