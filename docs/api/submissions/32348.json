My dentist is located about 45 minutes from where my doctor is (relevant to the story).\n\nIt's also important to note that if you are even five minutes late for your doctor's appointment at this office, they won't see you. You have to be on time. This is common for most clinics though.\n\nI showed up for my doctor's appointment at 9:50am. I pay my copay, the medical assistant showed me back to a room, took my weight, BP, heart rate, and temperature, let me know my doctor would be in shortly, and closed the door.\n\nMy doctor is a good doctor and she's thorough and sometimes she goes over on her appointments. It's not uncommon for her to show up to the room 15 or 20 minutes late. It's not ideal, but I'm aware of it and tried to plan accordingly.\n\nI waited 45 minutes for her to come in, but she never did. As I said above, I had a dentist appointment, so I decided to leave. I tried to open the door, but the doorknob is broken. It turns, but the latch doesn't move. So I'm literally stuck in the room. I try the knob again, nothing. I tap on the door, and no one comes. I jiggle the knob, nothing. I knock on the door, no one hears. So, I try to get it to unlatch on my end by trying to push up on the knob and turn it at the same time, by trying to turn it quickly, and by trying to turn the knob while pulling the door towards me and also pushing it away from me. This made a lot of noise, and somebody started yelling at me to stop from the other side of the door. They opened the door, and there are four of the staff there looking at me like I'm unhinged. I apologized, said I had tried getting their attention by knocking but no one heard. All I got was \u201coh, we heard, we ALL heard, that was so unnecessary\u201d. Went to the front desk to ask for a refund for the copay since I wasn't seen, and they're all still looking at me like I'm some crazy person.\n\nI don't know. It was very embarrassing. Yes, I was irritated that I waited for so long and no one came. I feel like that's a normal and natural reaction to a situation like this. And this is a known issue with that doorknob. I've been trapped in that room before, but only for a minute. It needs to be fixed or replaced. Seems like a safety issue to me on top of everything else. And not just that, it's triggering for me to be locked in a room from the outside. But was I acting crazy or yelling or pounding on the door or trying to break it down? No. \n\nI don't know what I could have done differently. Wait a few more minutes? Try knocking louder? I'm embarrassed and angry now, and I tried to talk to them when I was there but I really had to get to my dentist appt and I feel like trying to go back and explain myself as just going to be weird and awkward\n\nSo yeah, AITA?", "created_utc": 1701720664, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18at1ib/aita_for_trying_to_open_my_room_door_at_the/", "score": 3207, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Rude and dangerous behavior on their part.", "NTA.\n\nThis is entirely unacceptable for many reasons.\n\nFirst, anything beyond 10 minutes waiting needs to be addressed.  Patient time is every bit as important as provider time, and while emergencies happen the patient is entitled to be advised and to reschedule if necessary.  They ought to give you a refund AND apologize.\n\nSecond, it is a fire hazard to have rooms that you can't get out of, whether because they are locked or because the doorknob is faulty.  I would report that to the local fire marshal.\n\nFinally (and this assumes you are in the US), there is a regulatory agency where you can file complaints.  It is sometimes called a \"Facility Services Complaint\" or something similar.  I'd file a complaint.\n\nIt goes without saying that you will need to find a new primary care provider, but you were (hopefully) already going to do that.", "NTA\n\nThe door should open when you attempt to open it.\n\n\u201coh, we heard, we ALL heard, that was so unnecessary\u201d\n\nI would have read them the riot act.", "They left you trapped in a room and ignored your efforts to get help to get out?

They need to fix their shoddy office and stop acting like people are lunatics for wanting to leave (whether or not the doctor is 45 minutes late).

The broken door is certainly a safety hazard, and they do need to address that.  You were literally imprisoned against your will, and you could've been screaming your head off and beat the door off it's hinges and you would still be NTA.\n\nI for sure wouldn't have waited 45 minutes, though.  It's one of my personal pet peeves when I get left in a room waiting for someone to get around to seeing me.  I have a 10-minute rule, 10 minutes to get me to a room and 10 minutes until the doctor sees me.  If they go over, I politely go to the reception desk and re-schedule.", "NTA! What else were you supposed to do--And why is it \"unnecessary\" to try to get the assistance of people who can help you? Especially those who are SUPPOSED to care for your well being? \n\nAnd I know it's the \"norm\" to be kept waiting at a doctor's office--but it really bothers me when there's zero understanding or sympathy for the patient. We can't all just wait around all day, either.\n\nI would definitely call the office to discuss how crappy that experience was. And 100% that door needs to be fixed. You might also be able to write an email--that could help you compose your thoughts without feeling flustered by talking to the staff in person.", ">All I got was \u201coh, we heard, we ALL heard, that was so unnecessary\u201d.\n\nWTF?  You were trapped there like a *prisoner*, and they had the GALL to tell you your attempts to escape were \u201cunnecessary\u201d?

Reading the original post I was shocked to see someone book appointments so close together in time, in my mind it was \u201cwow there\u2019s no way they could make it to both\u201d and then saw there was a 45min drive also & thought it must\u2019ve been a scheduling error. Then I made it to the comments and apparently everyone is saying they\u2019ve never waited more than 10 minutes and that a 15 minute wait is unacceptable/unheard of.

My personal record was 1.5 hours from the taking vitals to the actual exam, which lasted 20 minutes. The only real recourse is to find another doctor, and that will be an absolute PITA because so few take new patients, or your insurance, and your wait will be in months.

Sometimes my gynecologist is called away to deliver a baby. My dad's cardiologist was called away to a heart emergency at the hospital so my dad had to wait.

Also the staff is working hard all day, most of my staff and I work through lunch. We eat on the go, and hsve limited time for something as simple as a bathroom break. The system is overwhelmed and the shortage will continue because no one wants to take on the burden of primary care anymore.

Albeit my primary concern would be being trapped in a room with a violent patient, as that is far more common these days than fire. I\u2019m certain the physician has raised these concerns and they have fallen on deaf ears. \n\nNot to mention, it sounds like the physician has no idea what actually happened, outside of whatever the staff told them, if they told them anything. OP didn\u2019t say the physician was there when the door opened, just four staff members. (Note: we also don\u2019t get to control who our support staff are much of the time. Often medical assistants are poorly paid and it shows. If you get a gem, you shower them in gifts and love and hope and pray they never leave you)\n\nSo you could demand an apology, but you would probably definitely need to explain what actually happened first. I would say if the physician is always behind (over-scheduled in an attempt to extract every last penny from a probably already overworked physician), the staff is rude (poorly trained and likely poorly compensated staff), and the facility is falling apart, then it is likely that management is a flaming pile of crap and your physician is probably only biding their time until they can quit and gtfo anyway.

That\u2019s all on our own time and patients are scheduled very 15-20 minutes for the full clinic time.

You might spend the full time on the knee pain complaint they give and at the end they tell you they are so depressed they want to die or have been having chest pain when they walk. Something that has to be addressed. \n\nWhen you have more than one complaint and take time off work and wait for 20 minutes because of the above issues you would probably like it if we spent the time to address as much as we can. And we try to balance that with staying remotely on time. \n\nIf I am late it is because I have had to spend more time with someone(s) before you, a procedure took longer than expected, got caught on an urgent call or others before you have been late. Being late at all for your doctor appointment leaves no time for your visit. The result is either we are late for those after you or you have to reschedule.

Her patients all came in promptly at the time of their scheduled appointment so they were not to blame. \n\nAnd, yes, patients\u2019 time is valuable, too. As others have mentioned, patients are usually using PTO or taking unpaid time off of work for the appointment. The longer they have to wait, the more it costs them in actual dollars. Also, some of us have jobs where our time is also extremely valuable. Doctors aren\u2019t the only ones with services that are valued or who are working on tight and demanding schedules. And a lot of us don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to come 45 minutes late to a scheduled meeting or appointment. If we do that consistently, there are consequences both for us and for our employers. We learn to manage our schedules to minimize the times when we\u2019re late. \n\nIf a doctor is chronically late, always running 45 minutes behind, then they need to look at their scheduling practices and make some changes. Yes, things come up sometimes. Yes, patients can be late sometimes or have an unexpectedly complicated issue. If it\u2019s a sometimes thing, it\u2019s understandable.
