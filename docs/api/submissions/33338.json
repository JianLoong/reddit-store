To clarify I have no issue with what I do I loved raising my children full time and now that they\u2019ve started school I love seeing them off and nurturing them and bonding when they\u2019re home.

Take a uber/taxi home or ask a friend to be on standby.\n\nI am worried for you. This could be a one time thing or this could be him starting to show his true face.

Because he is treating you like an opponent in this, and this will breed resentment eventually. You two are not opponents, you're two people with limited amounts of energy, raising little people.

I hear those are harsher to deal with, than toddler threenager phase lol, kinda seeing it in a difference between my nieces and nephews' ages. Toddlers are incredible to witness when they figure out some things out, teenagers are incredible when they wanna sit down with you and have honest adult talk & spend time with you. I'm still learning to balance both with the ages in question.\n\n\nBut there's a difference with what you said and what SAHPs go through. You work with a few days off. You get to unwind from house/kid things at work, you have breaks to just breathe, drink, eat, go to the bathroom, cig breaks if you're into it. I don't know may SAHPs who do, and I'm in a country with a mandatory 1yr maternity leave for mothers, many jobs incorporating few weeks to few months of paternity leave now as well. You had \"plenty of days as a sole parent\", many SAHPs have plenty of *years* without decent breaks. I'm not saying you didn't struggle during your days, I'm sure you did because many parents do. But it's such a huge difference on those who stay at home and have to have all the leashes in their hands 24/7 no decent break. The house work is never ending. Three meals a day, keeping it all clean with little children involved, washing and folding and preparing everything, keeping tabs on supplies and groceries and medical visits. Another story if there's animals/pets involved too. Very little time for yourself because majority of it goes towards everyone else. You're right they're burnt out. I see it in my family and friends who are on the parental leave or had to be SAHPs when moving abroad to survive. \n\n\nThree year olds are still a lot of work. My current groups (2021 onwards, incl student practice) do not sleep more than 60-90 minutes in kindergarten. Many are at the age where they're at one or no nap a day. We do outdoor time when weather allows. I'm sure their parents take them out too. But they still have a routine they needed to abide by. And they're still curious little humans who'll spit out a million questions about one and the same. They're still going to test the boundaries, have age appropriate tantrums, still need entertainment whether by themselves or time with parents. They still need supervision in many aspects. They're learning basics manners and morals, how to regulate themselves and not to mention soaking in things from their environment. Many SAHPs also involve their children in many chores or house work in general, so those things take extra time and possibly another round of parent doing it all by themselves afterwards. As these are toddlers helping, messes are bound to be made.\n\n\nSo it's not all about letting the toddler loose outside for a few hours and a nap time resembling younger ages more. There's many more intricacies I didn't type out as this is long as is. Full-time parenting and housekeeping is a lot. It's even more when one parent has to mother the other one. Essentially being a single parent who'd be better off doing it all by themselves without the dead weight holding them back & contributing to nothing but more work/expenses/messes.", "This seems to be the issue: you've considered how being a SAHM without kids would look. Which, yeah, that's a pretty sweet deal! The problem is, when you have kids - especially young kids - you can't just decide whether or not you 'actually want' clean floors, you *need* clean floors because the bottle-age baby is going to grab and eat any dirt, hair, small piece of plastic, whatever that is lying around; you can't base laundry for 4 off doubling laundry for 2, kids will mess up their clothes with food and poop and random substances of unconfirmed origin, and easily go through multiple outfits per day (worse if they have school uniforms, come home muddy and need it washed and dried for the next day, because few folk are rich enough to have 5 full uniforms per kid which need replaced every six months after a growth spurt); you can't look at cooking/feeding a couple of adults and extrapolate that doubling the recipe adds minimal to no time, because different ages may need different food so you make multiple meals not just more of one, and you need to literally feed some of them (breast/bottle feeding, or spoonfeeding, or just monitoring because that pasta is getting smooshed into someone's hair the second you dare to consider just eating your own meal), and there may be multiple meal times as kids tend to go to bed earlier than adults so again cooking multiple times unless you and your partner are happy only eating leftovers.\n\nThere's a lot of extras that add up quite a lot compared to replacing any kids with the same number of adults. Not to mention there's no breaks or sick days or holidays without your partner taking over for you: if you and the kid are ill, and your partner has work, guess what, you better carry your sick bucket and look after the sick kid, or even if you're the only sick one, even worse since they'll still be running about and when they're at school you still need to make sure they have food and clothes and safe floors to come home to so don't think about going to bed until that's done!\n\nEach individual task may be easy, but doing it 24-7 is far from.

Yes, every relationship is different, but when one partner is abusive, couples counseling is very much not recommended.

They need to start making a plan to leave and that might be really hard- but implying another solution for them is to just plan their time better and then their Husband is going to stop throwing things at them, exploding with rage or giving them the silent treatment is not OK. She is probably already told that by the Husband (and it\u2019s not true). \n\nIf they can recognise that the need to leave I would suggest thinking about their connections- do they have friends or family that might be able to help them, or if they find themselves isolated look to find local women\u2019s services that might be able to support them. Contact a lawyer- find out what sort of support they could they potentially receive in the event of separation. Look at other local services - is there day care services that might allow OP to return to work if that is what is needed. It will be hard but it\u2019s better than living with abuse or raising children in an abusive household where they will grow up walking on eggshells waiting for the next bomb to drop.", "OP doesn\u2019t say she changed the older ones nappies, rather \u201cdid the nappies for bed.\u201d Looks like we interpreted what OP said differently."]}
