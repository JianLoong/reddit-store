You\u2019re both parents and the evening and weekend when you\u2019re both home, the expectation should be sharing the responsibilities.

You literally have been working all day and were so tired you fell asleep without meaning to.

A part which he apparently half-assed to the point where you had to do it yourself?\n\nI'm willing to bet that the reason he wasn't \"doubling down\" his morning is because he feels he \"got his way\" by forcing you to maintain your workday when he'd had a break for hours.\n\nJust try and think back, the times where he did double down, did you argue back with him?

You weren\u2019t asking him for the moon, you were asking him to put his own child that he chose to bring into the world with you to bed.\n\nYou need to have a serious conversation and tell him that his behaviour was unacceptable - as a SAHM you are the primary caregiver but you are not the ONLY caregiver and he should be expected to do his part in the evenings when he\u2019s home and on the weekends.

Take a uber/taxi home or ask a friend to be on standby.\n\nI am worried for you. This could be a one time thing or this could be him starting to show his true face. Please read: \u00ab\u00a0 Why he does that\u00a0\u00bb . It\u2019s a book about abusive men. \n\nRead it before talking to your husband. Read it again after if it goes well. If he ever shows any other signs, you will be ready to get out of there with your kids. Also look up what DARVO is.

Because he is treating you like an opponent in this, and this will breed resentment eventually. You two are not opponents, you're two people with limited amounts of energy, raising little people.

Someone in the depths of an abusive situation does not (or cannot) often see how their situation is abusive or how they are being abused. The psychological conditioning required to keep a partner submissive is immense and it\u2019s hard to break free from that conditioning. Without knowing what goes on throughout the rest of their marriage, I think marriage counseling could be a good starting point.

I hear those are harsher to deal with, than toddler threenager phase lol, kinda seeing it in a difference between my nieces and nephews' ages. Toddlers are incredible to witness when they figure out some things out, teenagers are incredible when they wanna sit down with you and have honest adult talk & spend time with you. I'm still learning to balance both with the ages in question.\n\n\nBut there's a difference with what you said and what SAHPs go through. You work with a few days off. You get to unwind from house/kid things at work, you have breaks to just breathe, drink, eat, go to the bathroom, cig breaks if you're into it. I don't know may SAHPs who do, and I'm in a country with a mandatory 1yr maternity leave for mothers, many jobs incorporating few weeks to few months of paternity leave now as well. You had \"plenty of days as a sole parent\", many SAHPs have plenty of *years* without decent breaks. I'm not saying you didn't struggle during your days, I'm sure you did because many parents do. But it's such a huge difference on those who stay at home and have to have all the leashes in their hands 24/7 no decent break. The house work is never ending. Three meals a day, keeping it all clean with little children involved, washing and folding and preparing everything, keeping tabs on supplies and groceries and medical visits. Another story if there's animals/pets involved too. Very little time for yourself because majority of it goes towards everyone else. You're right they're burnt out. I see it in my family and friends who are on the parental leave or had to be SAHPs when moving abroad to survive. \n\n\nThree year olds are still a lot of work. My current groups (2021 onwards, incl student practice) do not sleep more than 60-90 minutes in kindergarten. Many are at the age where they're at one or no nap a day. We do outdoor time when weather allows. I'm sure their parents take them out too. But they still have a routine they needed to abide by. And they're still curious little humans who'll spit out a million questions about one and the same. They're still going to test the boundaries, have age appropriate tantrums, still need entertainment whether by themselves or time with parents. They still need supervision in many aspects. They're learning basics manners and morals, how to regulate themselves and not to mention soaking in things from their environment. Many SAHPs also involve their children in many chores or house work in general, so those things take extra time and possibly another round of parent doing it all by themselves afterwards. As these are toddlers helping, messes are bound to be made.\n\n\nSo it's not all about letting the toddler loose outside for a few hours and a nap time resembling younger ages more. There's many more intricacies I didn't type out as this is long as is. Full-time parenting and housekeeping is a lot. It's even more when one parent has to mother the other one. Essentially being a single parent who'd be better off doing it all by themselves without the dead weight holding them back & contributing to nothing but more work/expenses/messes.", "This seems to be the issue: you've considered how being a SAHM without kids would look. Which, yeah, that's a pretty sweet deal! The problem is, when you have kids - especially young kids - you can't just decide whether or not you 'actually want' clean floors, you *need* clean floors because the bottle-age baby is going to grab and eat any dirt, hair, small piece of plastic, whatever that is lying around; you can't base laundry for 4 off doubling laundry for 2, kids will mess up their clothes with food and poop and random substances of unconfirmed origin, and easily go through multiple outfits per day (worse if they have school uniforms, come home muddy and need it washed and dried for the next day, because few folk are rich enough to have 5 full uniforms per kid which need replaced every six months after a growth spurt); you can't look at cooking/feeding a couple of adults and extrapolate that doubling the recipe adds minimal to no time, because different ages may need different food so you make multiple meals not just more of one, and you need to literally feed some of them (breast/bottle feeding, or spoonfeeding, or just monitoring because that pasta is getting smooshed into someone's hair the second you dare to consider just eating your own meal), and there may be multiple meal times as kids tend to go to bed earlier than adults so again cooking multiple times unless you and your partner are happy only eating leftovers.\n\nThere's a lot of extras that add up quite a lot compared to replacing any kids with the same number of adults. Not to mention there's no breaks or sick days or holidays without your partner taking over for you: if you and the kid are ill, and your partner has work, guess what, you better carry your sick bucket and look after the sick kid, or even if you're the only sick one, even worse since they'll still be running about and when they're at school you still need to make sure they have food and clothes and safe floors to come home to so don't think about going to bed until that's done!\n\nEach individual task may be easy, but doing it 24-7 is far from. Being able to clock out from a harder job immediately makes it easier.", "kids sometimes have to change several times a day, plus bedsheets and towels and sports and everything that happens in between\n\nbelieve me I have only one kid but I would never manage with just 2 loads of laundry per week, it's 5 minimum and they are always full loads", "Even if she has 2-3 hours per day of chores like this person claims, that still leaves 4-5 hour of nap time per day. I would kill for a 4-5 hour daily nap.", "Idk, they'd probably argue that he's fat or that he's an adult and can cook for himself after a 12-14 hr shift,, 5 days a week even tho she's been home all day and kids are in school \ud83e\udd74\n\nEdit: trust me, I've seen similar scenarios", "Your math is so creative.  Using her own timeline, she\u2019s really only child free from maybe 9a-11:30a.  The rest of the day she has at least one kid and still does all the things.  A \u201cnormal\u201d task takes twice as long with the little interruptions and whatnot.  I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s horrible or she doesn\u2019t enjoy being a parent, but don\u2019t diminish her contribution just because she doesn\u2019t have to drive to a separate office to do it.  If she had so much \u201cnap time\u201d she wouldn\u2019t have fallen asleep with her kid.  \n\nNot one partner is more important or should have their contribution more validated, it\u2019s just different.  If \u201call she did\u201d all day was take care of the kids, it\u2019s clearly too easy and that\u2019s more reason he should have just done what he needed to do to start the nighttime routine and not been such a dick about it."]}
