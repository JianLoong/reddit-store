Sounds like husband didn't ever plan to move and expected you to 'get it out of your system' then come home - but that is an assumption on my part. Because the house wasn't sold when you moved, there is little incentive for them to move now.  At the same time, you have established a life for yourself in your new location - make sure you are not sending any money back, set up savings where you are and ensure your own financial freedom.", "NTA.  If the agreement is that they would move, this seems like his soft push for a divorce.", "NTA.\n\nIs he actually asking you to quit your job and move back? Or is he happy being away from you and your kids?", "NTA\n\nHe agreed, but 18 months is a very long time for him not to follow.  How is your marriage?   I would reevaluate my relationship, you are happy away from him.  Maybe it's time to move on.  That is a choice only you can make.  Did you move to a big city and your old home is rural?  I just don't understand the change of heart from you husband and his mother.", "NTA\n\n> God has provided for us here.\n\n *eyeroll*", "NTA. He doesnt want to live with you but doesnt want to pay child support. See an attorney.", "NTA, but you do have a serious problem. You need to get to the bottom of his decision because that is odd behavior. My guess? He's happy without you and the kids and hasn't found a way to tell you yet.", "NTA - but I think there is a bigger issue.  How often do you and your husband see each other?  Or him and the kids?\n\nIn the current climate, houses are selling really well.  Maybe talk to the realtor yourself to find out why it's not getting any bites.  Is it overpriced?  Does it need work?  Is it accessible for tours?  Does it look like a tornado hit it whenever people come to look at it?\n\nGod has provided for you in 2 places, I think there's more going on as to why your husband and MIL don't want to move.  It's been a year and a half, you've established a life for yourself and your kids.  You need to have really open and honest conversations with your husband and think about what's best for you and the children.", "NTA\n\nReading through the comments it seems you might need to look into a divorce lawyer. Get child support and sell the house and split proceeds. Either way he will be moving elsewhere.\n\nAnd if he is not calling/texting much I would be wondering if he was cheating and that explains why he hasn\u2019t sold the house.", "Info: did the house ever actually get listed?", "NTA for expecting him to move after he agreed to do so. I think, though, he didn't make a \"180 turn around,\" because he likely never wanted to move in the first place. \n\nSo, now you have to decide if it's worth staying in this marriage with someone who won't move.", "Is the house actually listed?  Have you spoken to the realtor?", "NTA time to file for divorce.", "NTA\n\nBut you know your husband has been lying to you, right?\nYou only have his word about the visits to the house and the offers.

And now don\u2019t like what you happy and as a guess earn more money?", "Check that he hasn't somehow sold the house and kept the money", "NTA hi ey divorce him, fight for the your part of the house and child support.

It sounds like you're doing perfectly well with your children on your own.  It's time to get yourself some child support, and establish that you have custody of your children.\n\nHonestly, it doesn't matter why your husband isn't there.  The fact that he isn't there and is hiding behind such a flimsy excuse (why can't he rent out the darned house, for example?) gives you all the information you need.\n\nNTA\n\nP.S.

Perhaps he needs reminding that God provided him with a wife.", "Nta God?? So maybe God provided you with a better job to make your life and your familie's life better.  That is such a stupid thing to say to you.  Maybe time to leave hubby with his mommy and movenl on.  God decided you should drop his ass. Is this the example of how you want your children to behave.  He agreed to move but lied and doesnt care enough to be in your and your childrens lives.

I\u2019m sorry, but from all that I read, it sounds like he\u2019s distancing himself from you and the kids. I know it\u2019s hard and sucks, but it looks like your relationship is probably over. I\u2019m so sorry, what he is doing and did is super fucking shitty. He seems like a coward trying to take the easy way out.", "NTA. \n\nIt\u2019s been 1.5 years. He\u2019s not moving. He likely never intended to move. It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t care where you and the kids live. I know it\u2019s a hard truth to face, but that\u2019s the reality of the situation. \n\nGet a lawyer and serve the papers. Your marriage has been over for 1.5 years. Unfortunately, you\u2019re just now realizing it.", "NTA. Anyone who starts citing god as the scapegoat for their own decisions isn't worth your time. If he wanted to be with you, he would have moved when you did. \n\nPlenty of people move without having sold their previous house. Hubby is just fine living with just his mummy again. \n\nLet him. Start divorce proceedings. If he decides to move, insist he & MIL can't move in with you until you have couples counseling and are convinced of what decision is better, divorce, or reconcile. \n\nJust moving is not enough! Whatever has made him just fine & dandy with living apart for over a year would still be there. Sooner or later, it would surface again. Best of luck!", "NTA.  It sounds like he has moved on while leading you on.  File for divorce, full custody and child support and whatever else you can get out if him.  Selling the house might be forced when you divorce and make sure it is handled by someone reputable.  I\u2019ve seen some pretty slimy stuff (friends offering to \u201cbuy\u201d at a low price so spouse could get it back at a lower cost).  Take care if yourself and the kids.  You will be less two dead weights when you are done.", "NTA.  Next text to your husband should be:\n\nIn 30 days time there is going to be a man in my bed, in the new location.
