But for your boyfriend to say it's weird and he sounded like he's sexualizing your action with your young brother, that at your age your lap should be reserve for your partners, those are some red flags. He doesn't get to define your relationship with your siblings, and calling it weird or get to tell you how to act with your siblings. I would leave him if I were you.", "My baby brother still sits on my lap and he is 41. Although he does it because he weighs more than I do and he thinks it's funny. Then his wife piles on top and eventually our parents separate us.", "Yes. This.", "I do. Im 37 and I sit on my dad's lap sometimes. (not my mom's because she is several inches shorter than me and it wouldn\u2019t work.)", "Even if he were a teen, if there aren't any other reasons to suggest it might be inappropriate intimacy, it's really not weird.", "The only *wildly weird* one in this scenario is your BF. NTA", "A bit possessive and a bit messed up of the head.\n\nWhen he sees that, he\u2019ll explode.\n\nDude needs therapy. You need new boyfriend- NTA", "I think he\u2019s six years old. I believe the 6m was intended to mean 6-year old male.  But, I agree that this is a red flag.", "6yo boy lol, now I'm picturing a 6mo playing 3ds. Still what a psycho bf.", "Even then, siblings sometimes just sit on each other either because we show affection or because we're being dicks as siblings can be. It's not weird unless someone makes it weird by putting these gross sexual connotations to it", "Even if he was 16 the bf would be an AH. He doesn\u2019t get to claim her lap as his property!", "That's exactly what I thought", "Right?  That was where boyfriend's mind went first?  Uhhhhh..?", "I was a constant lap sitter as a child. That\u2019s gross that he thinks that way. How dare he. This is a child and laps are comfy.", "Pretty sure they meant 6 years old but it's still hella weird", "You're correct, I misread that. Still creepy as fuck.", "Very true.", "Definitely", "Yes I found that creepy"]}
