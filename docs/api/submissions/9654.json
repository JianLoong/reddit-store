He got out of a bad situation and made a better life for himself. He would like to give his niece a chance at a better life too, which I am all for except she shows no signs of ever doing anything with her life.\n\nMy niece (husband's brother's kid) is 20. Her dad kicked her out at 14 and she has been living with her grandma ever since. Grandma's health is declining and she can no longer support her. A couple months ago they let her internet boyfriend move in with them, neither of them had ever met him irl, which is a major red flag to me. They all currently live with my husband's other brother in a different state. \n\nCurrent situation:\nThe brother they live with and his gf and moving next month and have told his mom that because of her health conditions she can move with them and they will help her, however \"the kids\" as we call them are not welcome to move with them. \n\nUntil a few days ago apparently my niece thought her uncle and his gf would move out and her grandma would stay and just magically cover all the rent 2k+ a month so her and her bf could continue free loading off her at their current residence. She also is so entitled she says its not fair people think she should take care of her gradma because that's not what she wants, but she still thinks she should live with grandma rent free. \n\nNeither of them have jobs,\u00a0 the boyfriend gets a small government check every month which he uses as an excuse to not work or he will lose his benifits. He is 18 and both physically and mentally capable of working. Now they will both be homeless in about 3 weeks unless we take them in and move them 1000 miles and across multiple states and let them live in our basement. \n\nThe thing is she has been saying she will get a job for 2 years since she finished hs and never has, they have no money (like not 2 pennys to rub together) and no plan. Last night they finally called my husband realizing he is their only option. Neither of them have ever held a job or payed rent/bills. They have no money to move and neither of them drive. They can't even afford a bus ticket let alone pay to move their posessions. We live in a small town in the middle of nowhere where driving is required if you ever want to leave the 3 square mile town. Apparently they both have too much anxiety about driving and from what I can tell have no intention of learning. They say they will get jobs but I don't believe them. They are being completely entitled and selfish and after not talking to us for almost a year are now begging to move into our house. I'm ready to let them be homeless and learn a hard lesson. I already told my husband I am not running a homeless shelter.

Granted, things were different in the 70\u2019s and I had lucked into a good job (before that it was McDonald\u2019s).

He did not state, \"I'm unable to work.\"  If true, this statement is suspect and does not match the majority of the full SSD/SSI population. There are people on SSD/SSI and some in the state's Long Term Care Service program (chronic terminal illnesses) who work.  There are a lot of options he could pursue such as subsidized housing  and w/his disability he'd be at the top of the wait list. The Ticket to Work program coaches and tracks every person to avoid making too much money to avoid losing benefits in the form of monthly money and healthcare. This is not a risky opportunity. It is a sound and vetted federal program. In general, folks are describing these two as either lost souls or losers; either way, they need a plan.", "Yeah just intended to outline that a lot of disabilities are not necessarily something she\u2019d know about. \n\nHey, we all go off sometimes, stuff like this gets people heated.

However, they aren\u2019t married, so at least niece should be working, her finances don\u2019t affect his eligibility for stuff.\n\n\u2026and before I get flamed to death, if you have a disability that is bad enough that they actually give that pay, you very well may not be able to afford the healthcare you need if you choose to go back to the workforce.
