We hired a cantor (who has conducted religious ceremonies for my husband\u2019s family in the past) to lead the ceremony.\n\nEverything was going fine until he deviated from the ceremony script he shared with us, and whipped out a children\u2019s book which he began to tell everyone was written by his daughter. At first, he said it was his gift to our daughter and he gifts each child a book during these ceremonies, but then he proceeded to tell everyone that they can also buy it on Amazon and details about who the book was about, the name of the author etc. Then, he essentially stopped the ceremony so our photographer could get photos of him with us and our daughter and the book so his daughter could advertise her book on her website. \n\nNeedless to say, I was pissed off that he did this without any warning or asking us in advance. Two seconds ago, I was tearing up speaking about how my daughter is named after my late grandfather, and now we\u2019re suddenly advertising his daughters children\u2019s book? But we smiled for the photo, and played it cool in front of our guests. After the photo, the ceremony continued.\n\nHe has since reached out multiple times, texting my husband and leaving me a voicemail asking for the photo. My husband doesn\u2019t care much either way about sending the photos, but agrees it was inappropriate to suddenly turn our ceremony into an opportunity to advertise his daughter\u2019s book. He\u2019s left it in my court, and so far I\u2019m ignoring all communications and not sending the photo. Is there another side to this?

Period. The end.\n\nBut to interrupt your special occasion to actually go on a PR spiel with details of how to buy the book for your guests? Or even worse, to use the photographer that YOU PAID FOR, for your simcha, to get a PHOTO OP?!! Not only is that unbelievably tacky . . . it's such a huge conflict of interest given his position in the community as a respected religious figure that I can hardly fathom it. He was at your event *in a professional capacity*, to bless your child and name her in front of friends and family, and literally welcome her into the community in an official religious capacity, I don't think it's an exaggeration to call his behaviour disgusting and deeply inappropriate.\n\nAnd I think that rather than ignoring him, it would be perfectly acceptable if he keeps on contacting you, to politely and firmly reply to him that you were very taken aback and disappointed when he used your simcha as a platform to advertise his daughter's book, that you found it very inappropriate, and that in fact you have not kept those pictures because \"promo shots\" of the picture book were not a part of the day that you intended to put in any albums or frames for your family. Perhaps he or his daughter would like the name of your photographer if they would like to schedule that sort of PR photo session. You are absolutely NTA.", "NTA he needs to learn not to do this at peoples events without permission. Also he\u2019s not entitled to your photos. My only thing would be that I think you should text or call and tell him exactly why you\u2019re not sending the photos. That way he knows for the future. If he argues maybe leave a bad review to warn his future clients.", "NTA - before you send the photo, send a contract to him for the rights of the photo as well as a percentage of any profits from the sale of said book that the picture generates.  Also, let him know how inappropriate it was to interject the infomercial into your ceremony and that you will be leaving a Yelp review.", "It may be best to ghost him. However, if it becomes necessary for a conversation, you might say something like, \"I'm sorry, but we did not consent to our images being used for any kind of advertising. I intend to keep those photos private.

He turned a special moment for your daughter into a commercial for his daughter's book.  I'd report him to whatever authority presides over Cantors.  Then post about the ceremony on all the social media I could to warn others.  My petty ass would also leave a negative review on Amazon for the book (even though the daughter might not have sanctioned his actions).  Don't share it.  OP is NTA.", "Children cannot be used to advertise anything for sale if they don\u2019t have a work permit. Your child is not a professional model and you definitely do not want strangers seeing her photo. You can sue him for unauthorized use. \n\nTell him this because he is going to do this with other children whose parents might feel an obligation or who don\u2019t know the law.

What he did was totally inappropriate. Completely within your rights to not share the photo with him. I do think you should respond to him at least once though, to make him aware that you didn't consent to him launching a sales pitch in the middle of your daughter's naming ceremony, nor do you consent for him to use the photo of your daughter. It sounds like he's truly deluded and maybe unaware that what he did wasn't OK. I wonder how many other times he's done something like this.", "NTA but you need to let the cantor know that his behavior was wildly inappropriate.

I went to a book presentation once that took place in close circles. The author had invited a limited crowd, but another author heard about it and 'popped by'. He ended up promoting his own self-pub book that he 'happened' to carry with him and sold all of his copies to her friends. He then had the audacity to walk over to the publisher with the manuscript of his new book, after stealing her thunder and making sure he had plenty of pictures.

He will back down.", "Apologies in advance since this is a bit off topic and I'm curious in a sort of semi-professional way...is this a traditional naming practice in your community at the 1st birthday? I've never heard of this before! I work for an Orthodox synagogue in Canada - Sephardic congregation - we have a number of Ashkenazi congregants as well but our religious ceremonies follow middle-eastern Sephardic traditions. Note, I myself am not Jewish so everything I know about the various religious ceremonies I've learned here, but I've been here 20 years and thought I'd at least heard of most of them (orthodox, traditional, conservative, and reform included - the only ones I'm really not familiar with are the ultra-orthodox or chasidic ceremonies - we don't have a community of that level in my city).\n\nI'm aware of the brit milah where a boy's name is announced, and there's often (but not always) a brit bat or a simchat bat on the first chance after a girl is born where the name is announced. Depending on the family's traditions this can be very elaborate (father reads from the torah on Saturday, big lunch is served, etc.), or it can just be a birth announcement with the name at Friday night service with mostly just men in attendance and there might be a quick snack and a shot of whisky (or arak!) on offer.\n\nGoogle isn't helping and the rabbi I work with isn't answering his text messages! (I will totally forget I was curious about this and wanted to ask him about it the next time I see him person...)\n\nTo appease the judgement bots, NTA. This was appalling behaviour (and believe me when I tell you after 20 years in administration/membership management at a synagogue, I've seen some doozy behaviour....).", "NTA.

And you really don't get a benefit (advertising pictures) out of someone's event without at MINIMUM talking to them first.\n\nIf you did really like the book, you could always consider leaving a review online. But definitely not TA for not wanting your kid's face to be used for advertising", "ESH.\n\nHim for dropping an ad in the midst of your family's special ceremony.\n\nYou for not just \\*telling\\* you're not going to send the picture, and why. It's a quick phone call or less than two minutes to send a text or email.\n\nSo many posts, such as this one, on in this space can be solved with Use Your Words. It's not hard.", "NTA but, seriously, stop indoctrinating your daughter into any religion.  You have no idea how she\u2019ll feel about religion when she\u2019s older, and most religions are very difficult on women.", "That was so wrong.  I'm a former pastor, that's just beyond anything that would be ethically acceptable, and it's so inappropriate.  \"While we appreciate you services, it was utterly inappropriate to hijack out ceremony to make a plea for people to purchase you daughter's book.

I haven\u2019t investigated to see if she\u2019s using these photos on her Amazon or website, but either way, you\u2019re right that I wouldn\u2019t know if she was in on it. The cantor may have just assumed it was ok to do, based upon his longer history with my husband\u2019s family, but asks permission otherwise.\n\nThere are just so many other ways that he could have gone about it such as asking for permission  in advance, gifting but not telling people how to buy the book, doing the photo after the ceremony rather than in the middle of it\u2026 the whole thing left such a bitter taste in my mouth!", "You make some great points!!! Thank you.", "For sure! I was going to ignore him and move on, but if he keeps asking, an interaction will occur (and, with the encouragement of so many comments here, at least maybe if we say something, he won\u2019t do it to another family!)", "That would be extra petty! Lol", "This book was definitely written by his daughter. \n\nThat\u2019s really awful, and I\u2019m glad he didn\u2019t get a contract. Some people have no concept of what\u2019s appropriate!", "No problem at all!! \n\nWe\u2019re reform/culturally Jewish so the rules are less stringent in general, however, we definitely did the ceremony later than usual (as it\u2019s more common to do it closer to the baby\u2019s birth). While boys get their Hebrew name at their bris, there\u2019s no real rule around when a girl has to get her Hebrew name. We just decided to combine it with the first birthday, so as to not to have to drag people out to two events. \n\nAs a descendant of former Soviet Union Jews (so, Ashkenazi) , a lot of the traditions were lost over those generations living under communism.

I'm so genuinely sorry that you have had to deal with this. I can only imagine how you must have felt in the midst of your special day, having him behave that way.\n\nMazal tov on your beautiful little girl, and wishing you only happiness and good things going forward.", "I know, I just feel bad such a special time was for you was treated like an infomercial!", "Thanks so much for your response! I love learning about the different cultures, traditions, and more contemporary practices - especially ones that are being reclaimed! Mazal Tov to your daughter and family, and in fine middle-eastern Sephardic tradition - lululululululu!"]}
