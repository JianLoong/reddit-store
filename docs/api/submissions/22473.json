After a little while, my aunt called Vicky's parents, and they were surprised, embarrassed, and apologetic. Her behavior was corrected, and so far they seem to be doing okay. It could be nothing, I mean they are 3, but I'll admit it worries me that it got to the point of almost switching centers entirely, because of something daycare attendees should be watching for, meaning they either didn't notice \"Carson being mean\" or didn't care enough to correct it. I may be overthrowing this. Regardless, NTA! Carson will have plenty of other birthday parties to have fun at, let your son have his day the way he wants it.", "NTA.

Perfectly reasonable. I'm a teacher, who has taught kindergarten, and i have two kids of my own. If you are feeling guilty at all, hope i can reassure you that I approve of your decision. \n\nSome parents are bullies and weaponize birthday parties bc play dates. It's ridiculous.

At that age, inviting only a handful of the kids he gets along with best is all you SHOULD be doing. Carson's mom could have thought her kid lost his invitation. You are friends on Facebook--she might not be fully aware of the issue between your boys. \n\nDon't respond if she presses further and becomes an AH.

It wasn't because of anything wrong at the daycare, i just didn't like to go. I always had fun once I was there. If you were a good parent, you would have invited all the kids, but kept an eye out for any bullying or whatever. Instead, you decided to use your imagination.

When it continued into the 2nd and 3rd week, I pushed a little harder for him to give me a reason he didn\u2019t want to go, and that\u2019s when he told me that Carson was being mean and bugging him. The day he told me that, I brought it up to the daycare staff. They did tell me there had been a few issues between the two boys, so they had been keeping them separate, having them do different activities when possible, seating them at different tables for lunch etc. \nit took a couple weeks for things to adjust but everything had been resolved since, no more issues and my son is excited to go to daycare every morning again!", "Because OP doesn't give a shit. There's no evidence at all the screaming is related to the boy she excluded from the party. That's all in OPs imagination.", "We\u2019re not actually Facebook friends, she just reached out to me!", "I mean, he\u2019s pretty excited about it, and mentions his party almost daily, so it\u2019s actually very likely that he was talking to one of his friends about it. Even his teachers have said that he\u2019s mentioned it to them", "Yes, they do--birthday parties are a HUGE deal at that age.", "I agree, NTA. But please be aware of things when they get into school. I have a rule for my kids, you invite the whole class, all of one sex (boys or girls - I have one of each), or just a couple kids from any particular class.\n\nI have an ADHD kid that hardly gets invited to anything. They're not mean, just a lot to handle and we know this, so we stay and supervise them at everything they get invited to our involved in. It's hard on their little feelings when they don't understand. I'm the adult and I can handle a rambunctious child but some kids never get the chance to be in on the fun.\n\nI also have a shy child that was a scout (I was the leader). They were only one of two kids that didn't get invited to the birthday party of one of the other Scouts in our group. Out of 13 kids. Then the mom had the audacity to talk to me about the party (I didn't say anything about it like the mom in the OP though). I was livid because I took the time to volunteer as a leader for your kid and she couldn't be bothered to include mine. Luckily my child was oblivious when the other kids were talking about it.\n\nI think having the \"different\" kids makes you a little more aware of things. Maybe Carson is 'mean' because he has an undiagnosed issue. Maybe he's reacting because he didn't get invited the first time and he doesn't know how to process his feelings. I think at 3, you're fine, and you really don't have the responsibility to make everyone else happy. I just hope that anyone that reads this will understand that sometimes the different kids can't help their behavior and like to be included too.", "I wish it was easier to enforce the \"don't talk about it at school\" idea.
