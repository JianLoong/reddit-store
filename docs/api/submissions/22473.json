I made the mistake of inviting my daughter\u2019s whole class to one of her birthday parties once. Never again. Invite who he wants and only who he wants.", "NTA. Your son\u2019s feelings supersede the need to be nice to everyone and invite every kid. If Carson is mean to your son, inviting him to your son\u2019s party is cruel to your son. Be in his corner.", "NTA, it's your son's birthday and he should be able to have fun.", "NTA I think it\u2019s weird that she asked . If ur invited there\u2019s usually no confusion that you are", "NTA, \n\nI think you did chose the right path by saying that only a limited amount of kids were invited. It's not your responsibility to make Carson or his mom happy. Your responsibility is to ensure that your son has a great birthday party with people and kids surrounding him who love and like him. \n\nWe used to invite a kid during our kindergarten time to my twins birthdays. They are also in the same class at their elementary school, but this kid got under bad influence and is now very mean to everyone, including my twins. I didn't think for a second that we should invite him, because the years before he was invited. My sons are more important and they deserve a happy and fun day.", "NTA\n\nYour son clearly doesn't feel comfortable around that kid. If your friends kid wanted to come,he should learn some better manners and learn how to be nice.\n\nIt might be worth explaining the situation between your kids to her, so she can better understand and maybe even help her kid be a nicer person. You can also explain that the daycare knows about it.", "The post indicates the mom messaged OP on Facebook. No phone numbers exchanged.", "that\u2019s exactly why he wasn\u2019t invited. My son being comfortable is more important to me than being nice to everyone, I just feel a little bad because his mom asked about it", "I have the feeling that she may know that Carson isn\u2019t nice but I think she kind of enables it. I once saw Carson pushing a little girl, and the little girl got up and shoved him back, and he fell. His mom also saw this and actually yelled at the little girl, he reasoning being that she was bigger than Carson.", "Thanks, I missed that. I would probably just leave it on read.", "But you\u2019ll get over it, right? \ud83d\ude0a Happy birthday to your son! \ud83d\udc51\ud83c\udf82\ud83e\uddf8", "That is toxic parenting.

You're the mom, and you make the rules. And if those rules ensure that your son does not have to spend time with someone he doesn't like, then you're doing the right thing.\n\nThis should be an eye-opener for the other mother, to see that her son is perhaps not the kindest to other kids and that this is an opportunity to correct that kid's behavior.\n\nHappy birthday to your son, I hope he has an amazing birthday.", "Seems weird that you don't know what the problem was if he spent a whole month screaming.\n\nHow was it resolved?", "Info: is Carson the only child from the daycare, in your sons age group, to not be invited?", "Did you invite every other kid in the daycare class? If so then you are the asshole. 3 year olds fight one day and be best friends the next. Im not saying hes particularly nice... i dont know the situation. but if you invited every other kid other than this particularly one its pretty bad. Now if you invited a select group thats a different story. You didnt send invites to the daycare did you?", "Nta", "As the mother to a Carson (he\u2019s 14 now and much better), I would encourage you to reach out to the mom and explain why.", "NTA\n\nNope. Bullies don\u2019t get to come to parties. I know the Internet is widely divided on this and ya\u2019ll can downvote me forever but twats don\u2019t get an invite!!! \n\nI don\u2019t care how old they are. Being born the same year in the same school district does not entitle anyone to an invite.", "NTA. Keeping a party small for a 3 year old is more than reasonable.", "NTA. \nAnd from your other comment re the mother probably knowing her kid is a bully, this is definitely not a connection you want.\nKeep your son safe 100%. \nI hope he enjoys the party \ud83d\ude42", "No, I asked my son who he wanted to invite, and he listed 4 people, so those were the 4 people we sent invites to. I didn\u2019t send physical invites either, I reached out to their parents either on social media, or I texted them. \nThere is roughly 15 kids in my sons age group at daycare.", "No, we only invited 4 other kids from daycare. I invited who my son wanted to.", "I will say maybe at a separate point in time to bring this up to her? Idk if the daycare would've told her about \"Carson being mean\" considering they never informed you, and your son was throwing tantrums just to avoid him, it was only after YOU brought it up to THEM that things \"slowly got better\".\n\nMy aunt had a similar issue with her daughter and her friend \"Vicky\" who would pressure my cousin, get jealous and tell her not to talk with their classmates, and mess with her things- in 1st grade! After a little while, my aunt called Vicky's parents, and they were surprised, embarrassed, and apologetic. Her behavior was corrected, and so far they seem to be doing okay. It could be nothing, I mean they are 3, but I'll admit it worries me that it got to the point of almost switching centers entirely, because of something daycare attendees should be watching for, meaning they either didn't notice \"Carson being mean\" or didn't care enough to correct it. I may be overthrowing this. Regardless, NTA! Carson will have plenty of other birthday parties to have fun at, let your son have his day the way he wants it.", "NTA.  The mom's entitlement and lack of boundaries are appalling and probably a clue as to why her kid's so awful.  These sound like two people you *definitely* would not want to socialize with.\n\nYour party, your invite list, your rules.  \n\nYou graciously are providing cupcakes to everyone in the class to celebrate your son's birthday there -- that is plenty.  \n\nYou owe this woman nothing.  If you try to explain, it will only give her more ammunition to argue with.", "it's important your son has fun at his own birthday party It's okay not to invite kids who your kid isn't a friend with .", "For what its worth it someone messaged me complaining they werent invited to a 3 year olds birthday it would probably justify the decision to not invite them.", "NTA at all then. Perfectly reasonable. I'm a teacher, who has taught kindergarten, and i have two kids of my own. If you are feeling guilty at all, hope i can reassure you that I approve of your decision. \n\nSome parents are bullies and weaponize birthday parties bc play dates. It's ridiculous. A small gathering for a three year old, where they chose their friends, is age appropriate and should cause zero drama.", "NTA it\u2019s not like the entire class was invited excluding only the one kid. Sounds like he\u2019s a little bully in the making unfortunately.", "The nta", "I would encourage you to reach out to the mom and explain why.", "we only invited 4 other kids from daycare. I invited who my son wanted to.", "That brought up an old memory.\n\nWhen my son was in Kindergarten, my husband got called in for a parent teacher conference because \"<son> was being racist.\"\n\nThe setting was story time, and he said he didn't want to hear the story of John Henry, because \"he was black.\"\n\nSo, my husband asked \"what about <husband's best friend>?  He's black.\"\n\nSon: He's not black, he's nice!\n\nIt turns out that the only black classmate he had was also a bully, and our son had translated the description of \"black\" to mean bully, and not skin color.", "This is kind of cute :)"]}
