Your son\u2019s feelings supersede the need to be nice to everyone and invite every kid. If Carson is mean to your son, inviting him to your son\u2019s party is cruel to your son.

If ur invited there\u2019s usually no confusion that you are", "NTA, \n\nI think you did chose the right path by saying that only a limited amount of kids were invited. It's not your responsibility to make Carson or his mom happy. Your responsibility is to ensure that your son has a great birthday party with people and kids surrounding him who love and like him. \n\nWe used to invite a kid during our kindergarten time to my twins birthdays. They are also in the same class at their elementary school, but this kid got under bad influence and is now very mean to everyone, including my twins. I didn't think for a second that we should invite him, because the years before he was invited. My sons are more important and they deserve a happy and fun day.", "NTA\n\nYour son clearly doesn't feel comfortable around that kid. If your friends kid wanted to come,he should learn some better manners and learn how to be nice.\n\nIt might be worth explaining the situation between your kids to her, so she can better understand and maybe even help her kid be a nicer person.
