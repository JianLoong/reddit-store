But please be aware of things when they get into school. I have a rule for my kids, you invite the whole class, all of one sex (boys or girls - I have one of each), or just a couple kids from any particular class.\n\nI have an ADHD kid that hardly gets invited to anything. They're not mean, just a lot to handle and we know this, so we stay and supervise them at everything they get invited to our involved in. It's hard on their little feelings when they don't understand. I'm the adult and I can handle a rambunctious child but some kids never get the chance to be in on the fun.\n\nI also have a shy child that was a scout (I was the leader). They were only one of two kids that didn't get invited to the birthday party of one of the other Scouts in our group. Out of 13 kids. Then the mom had the audacity to talk to me about the party (I didn't say anything about it like the mom in the OP though). I was livid because I took the time to volunteer as a leader for your kid and she couldn't be bothered to include mine. Luckily my child was oblivious when the other kids were talking about it.\n\nI think having the \"different\" kids makes you a little more aware of things. Maybe Carson is 'mean' because he has an undiagnosed issue. Maybe he's reacting because he didn't get invited the first time and he doesn't know how to process his feelings.

It\u2019s a three year olds birthday party, not college admissions, if they don\u2019t like someone then they don\u2019t get invited, it\u2019s not a big deal, you can\u2019t make everyone like you and not being invited to things is part of life. \n\nMy son has adhd and autism and can be very energetic and sometimes scares or annoys other, quieter kids, so he doesn\u2019t get invited to some kids parties in his class, it\u2019s not his fault but it\u2019s just reality, I\u2019d hate to make his class resent him by forcing his way into events that should be centred around one child\u2019s enjoyment. Some kids like him and some kids don\u2019t, that\u2019s life, and kids do poorly in the long run when their parents try to skew their perspective or play superhero by fixing everything instead of doing the hard work, which is helping them acquire life long tools to deal with big feelings like rejection.", "NTA.

Frankly, I would've met up with the woman face-to-face and told her exactly why I didn't invite her son. I think she needs a reality check if this isn't the first party he wasn't invited to. He's a bully in the making, and she seems clueless about it.", "NTA The fact that the mom is messaging and asking when/where is pretty entitled of her. No one is owed an invitation and your son\u2019s comfort and enjoyment at his own birthday party is priority number one.", "this is tough and as a newish mom i'm sure it's heartbreaking to be on the other side of it (ie carson's mom). it seems at this age that inviting everyone is probably just the most fair resolution - i know daycares can't dictate what we do as parents outside of their facility, but some at least recommend including everyone. like, they're only 2 - it's sad that your 2, almost 3 year old knows what it means to not like someone and also sad that such a young kid is seemingly acting like a bully already. i can't decide on a clear answer here, but wishing you luck with your choice and however it plays out!", "NTA - your son comes first. How on earth didn\u2019t the nursery pick this up? That\u2019s the worrying bit.", "NTA if the kids mean to your son then it would make his party miserable for him", "\"and I have heard this isn\u2019t the first party hes not been invited to\" right there you have your answer NTA!!!.", "NTA. That takes some serious audacity for that mom to reach out to you asking for the details when it should've been clear her kid was not invited. Probably explains a lot about her kid, too. \n\nOut of curiosity, how were the invitations distributed?

You said Carson has been left off other children's party invites. So instead of correcting her child's behavior, she probably called to bully or shame you into letting her son come.

(Or to invite almost all the boys/girls except for one or two of the students of that gender.) The exception is when the two kids obviously do not like each other and do not get along, or when one is bullying another. It sounds like you didn't do this - inviting one or two kids from daycare is not the same as inviting the entire class but one kid.\n\nSecondly, Carson is three. If his mother doesn't hype up this party to him, he has no reason to know he's missing it. Hopefully his behavior will improve over the next year or two and more people will be willing to invite him to their kids' parties.\n\nNTA.", "She asked to guilt an invite because she knows her son is unpopular for a reason.", "If it\u2019s not going to matter in 5 years, don\u2019t let it bother you for more than 5 minutes is my motto for stuff like this.", "You\u2019re Carson\u2019s mom right? That\u2019s the reason you\u2019re going this hard to paint OP as an inactive mother who doesn\u2019t know anything about the situation?? Get off the internet and deal with your bully of a toddler. If you think kids won\u2019t ice out a bully at that age you\u2019re an idiot. Kids are the best behavior correcting tools for each other cause once they figure out who the asshole is at daycare and the parents catch wind of it that kid never gets invited anywhere.

I don't know why you're defending this kid that much. What's your angle?\n\nAnyway...\n\n1. The son himself said he didn't like the other kid.

The other kids just weren't his friends. Carson is a bully, at least to the birthday boy. Where is your brain?", "Part of socialisation is learning to accept rejection, and learning that it\u2019s okay to reject others, you don\u2019t have to be everyone\u2019s friend nor should you feel obliged to especially at 3 years old, yes they do all act out occasionally, they also hold grudges and let go of the most random things, that\u2019s part of being 3. \n\nTeaching your kids that everyone is included in everything and loved by everyone is setting them up to fail, my kid hasn\u2019t bullied anyone but he has pissed some kids off, which is enough of a reason not to be invited, I don\u2019t invite my whole workforce to my parties and I\u2019m not being bullied, so who would benefit from him being at a party where the birthday kid doesn\u2019t like him? Not him, not them either, as this would only encourage ostracism at the party as the birthday child feels aggrieved and is surrounded by their best buds likely to take their side, however there is a lot to benefit from those children having a wonderful party and my child learning that it\u2019s not a big deal and there\u2019s always another party to go to. \n\nMy son wants every child in his class to come to his party, even the ones who haven\u2019t invited him to theirs, so clearly he\u2019s been raised in such a way that he is not deeply traumatised or vengeful by not being invited, he\u2019s good at taking rejection and he isn\u2019t internalising it because I don\u2019t make it a massive deal by arguing with parents or trying to \u2018investigate a dynamic\u2019, hes 4 and neurodivergent, if he can understand that people have the right to say no I\u2019m not sure why you\u2019re having such a hard time with it.", "You\u2019re just trying to be contrary, huh?", "Unless it\u2019s you, right?

When we asked him why he didn\u2019t want to go, he said \u201cCarson is mean to me\u201d.\n\nDid you even read the post??? IT'S IN THE POST. You either can't read or your reading comprehension sucks. Here is one of OP's comments, which was deleted but can see on the profile\n\n>You can fuck right off, you don't know Me, you don't know my kid, so you can take your BS opinions and shove them up your ass my son TOLD me this kid was being mean to him, that's how I know it was related.", "> For some background, I\u2019m not 100% sure what the exact issues were\n\nYes a 3 yo making one statement a month later is all that is required to fully understand the situation /s. OP didn't even bother to ask \"what did he do that was mean?\"", ">At the time that this was happening, he was having some changes, like transitioning to a toddler bed and starting potty training, so for the first about week and a half, I assumed he was just over tired and cranky and didn\u2019t want to go. When it continued into the 2nd and 3rd week, I pushed a little harder for him to give me a reason he didn\u2019t want to go, and that\u2019s when he told me that Carson was being mean and bugging him. The day he told me that, I brought it up to the daycare staff. They did tell me there had been a few issues between the two boys, so they had been keeping them separate, having them do different activities when possible, seating them at different tables for lunch etc. it took a couple weeks for things to adjust but everything had been resolved since, no more issues and my son is excited to go to daycare every morning again!\n\n\nAnother one of OP's comments. The daycare had to keep the boys separated to avoid issues. The daycare noticed, so mean behavior was present. Maybe you should look at OP profile and read their comments because it's very clear that Carson is the problem, so is his mother."]}
