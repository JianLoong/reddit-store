I recommend the following:\n\n1) You and your sister should stop sharing with your mother any information about who you're dating, at least in the early stages of a relationship. Wait until you're sure it's serious before introducing them to your mother or even mentioning their name. I did that with my own mother - not because she interfered (she didn't), but because she is a terrible gossip and I didn't want every member of our large extended family and every one of her friends knowing my private business. The only relationship of mine she ever knew about was one very long-term relationship.\n\n2) You should refuse point blank to engage in conversation with your mother about your sister's relationships, and your sister should do the same about yours. If your mother happens to find out something about your sister, doesn't approve, and wants to vent to you, you simply say \"This is not a topic for discussion, Mom.\" If she continues, walk out of the room. Hang up the phone. Whatever. And get your sister to do the same if Mom tries to vent to her about you.\n\nMom will soon stop interfering if she's getting no information and no reaction from either of you.", "NTA.

Because the \"if everyone did that\" is a really shallow way of framing a situation. Yeah, sure, if everyone was like that, but not everyone is and therefore it's a pointless add. It certainly doesn't make your sisters feelings less valid. It also makes your mother look insecure to bring this up.\n\n>My mom asked what was wrong with us and why were we narrowing the dating pool so much and judging people so harshly. I told her that's not it and she needs to learn to respect that she can't control what we want. She said she never tried to make decisions for us and was offended that I was claiming otherwise.\n\nExcept she is, and she needs to acknowledge that. You aren't really narrowing the dating pool that much for yourself, because at 26 the dating pool these days is mostly single guys either pursuing a professional life or an education. The average man at your age in North America doesn't necessarily have kids.\n\nAlso, it's perfectly reasonable to be put off of the sordid mix of a pregnancy between two people who are already split up at the time of the announcement. It shows the lack of stability that people try to avoid specifically from single parents.\n\nYou're also not judging people \"harshly.\" It isn't harsh to place certain individuals as not appealing. I'm gay, and I wouldn't call it \"harsh\" that I won't ever give women a consideration. While immutable traits may not be the best comparison to other such preferences, the fact remains that a preference is only harsh when front ended with a negative descriptor. Hell, even just having an explanation isn't \"harsh\" so long as you're not essentially putting a negative value to the individual *just* because you won't date them.\n\nNTA", "Nta", "NTA", "NTA\n\na brand new baby situation? no way.

Maybe one of the two of you will miss out on a great guy because of your restriction, but then again, maybe you'll also miss out on years and years of drama with an idiot ex.  It's your choice.  \n\nYour mom is right in that she wasn't making decisions for you.  Making a decision for you/your sister would be her insisting you date someone you're not interested in.  She's argued your choices with you, but that's different, and she is entitled to her opinion.  That said, you are every bit as much entitled to say \"Mom, I appreciate that you feel differently about this than I do, but I'm not willing to discuss this any further\"  and then stop engaging.

She herself married someone and had a blended family and she \"wants\" to feel better about her decision because your step siblings don't like this.

Especially if they're not classy. You'll get constant calls asking for money, claiming how horrible that dad is, etc, and eventually you get drug into the situation because you're the woman who's with the baby daddy. It's something that not everyone is interested in. And that's just some things that CAN go wrong, I'm not putting every single co-parenting situation into the same basket. Some situations are beautiful and well maintained and both sides are very happy and work hard to do well by their children. \nBefore I deactivated my Facebook account, I had the privilege to see a woman who, had two baby daddies and all she did was complain about both of them and whine and cry about how she can't afford things for her kids birthdays, etc , and then she'd turn around and post multiple posts about blowing all her money on weed and partying. Eventually she started an Only Fans which she advertised religiously on her page (tbh, she found her actual calling seeing her attitude, but that's me just being judgemental and I do feel VERY bad for her kids.) She then turned into a stripper and posted some very crazy and revealing photos. Anyway, after seeing something like *that*, I'd definitely say, I do understand why some people just don't want to deal with or even remotely be close to that sort of situation. You never know how crazy the baby mama can be, and if she's already an ex, there's probably a reason. I'm also not knocking people who make great money with Only fans or who strip for a living. I'm just pointing out this person's poor decisions and her kids suffer for it. At least, that's how it looks from here. \nOP is NTA for saying that to her mother. Not everyone wants to be in those situations. And if it isn't their kids, sometimes they don't want to deal with it since it isn't theirs. And that's perfectly okay. Just don't be in those relationships then. Everyone is allowed to have their own standards. Why would you want to be with someone who doesn't meet them anyway? You'll both be miserable then and it won't be worth it. Your lifestyles have to line up, you only get one life and have to be happy and make yourself happy. Why would you want to be with someone who doesn't want to be with you? Those choices never made any sense to me.

Stay strong and tell her her entitlement in expecting you to jump to her demands is mind-boggling. Just show her this post's comments.", ">single parents deserve happiness\n\nNot at your expense.\n\nNTA", "She's projecting a ton here, but it isn't about stepdad. It's about *her.* She cares so much about this because she was once a parent with kids in the dating scene, and she can't stand the idea of it being \"okay\" if that's not someone's thing. She's taking it incredibly personally that someone might not wanted to have dated her because she had kids.\n\nAnyway NTA you don't have to want to date your mom (figuratively speaking. If you were someone else entirely).", "NTA\n\nSo perfectly stated! \n\nI also understand that if she keeps pushing that either or both of you are likely to point out how her rosy view of your big family is all make believe and really rock her world. And if that were to happen, understand that you still wouldn't be the a-hole.", "Imo....I'd rather wait to see what the deal with the new kid was before deciding to date someone.\n\nDeadbeat dads are 1000% a NO for me, or if it's going to be complex drama with the Ex. Dating people with kids can be complex, cause you need to understand you not the priority. Dating someone that is expecting a kid is harder, because the dynamic/systems haven't been figured out yet. So you'd need to be prepared for everything to change once the baby comes along.", "Well, OP also said the friend's son thought things were going that way.", "NTA. Mom needs to listen to what her children are saying. What difference does it make if it \"narrows the dating pool\" by not dating people with kids. Maybe your sister doesn't ever want kids for herself. If she doesn't want her own kids, why would she want to be responsible for someone else's kids? Even if she might want some later, she may not want to deal with another adult, especially an ex, in the mix. What if either of you decide you never want to marry or commit to a SO? Will she just ignore that also? Most likely if that is not what she wants to happen. Mom's rose-colored glasses only see what she wants to believe happened between her kids and the stepdad and step siblings. If she won't remove the tinted view, she will never understand.", "NTA. I also didn't date anyone with kids when I was single. Yeah, it limited the dating pool, but it was a nonstarter for me.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is projecting here. The choice not to date a single parent isn't a judgement on that person. Dating a person with a kid involves serious lifestyle changes, and, in the long term, a commitment to being at least partially responsible for a child. Not everyone wants that kind of lifestyle or is interested in that kind of commitment."]}
