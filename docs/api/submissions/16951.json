You know it, but you won't convince her of that.\n\nSo I'd stop trying to reason with her. I recommend the following:\n\n1) You and your sister should stop sharing with your mother any information about who you're dating, at least in the early stages of a relationship. Wait until you're sure it's serious before introducing them to your mother or even mentioning their name. I did that with my own mother - not because she interfered (she didn't), but because she is a terrible gossip and I didn't want every member of our large extended family and every one of her friends knowing my private business. The only relationship of mine she ever knew about was one very long-term relationship.\n\n2) You should refuse point blank to engage in conversation with your mother about your sister's relationships, and your sister should do the same about yours. If your mother happens to find out something about your sister, doesn't approve, and wants to vent to you, you simply say \"This is not a topic for discussion, Mom.\" If she continues, walk out of the room. Hang up the phone. Whatever. And get your sister to do the same if Mom tries to vent to her about you.\n\nMom will soon stop interfering if she's getting no information and no reaction from either of you.", "NTA.

It's important for individuals to have autonomy over their own lives and make decisions based on their own preferences and values. Your mom's enthusiasm and projection of her own experiences onto your sister were not respectful of her choices. Your sister made it clear that she has always had a preference regarding dating someone with kids, and that's completely valid. It's not about judging people harshly or narrowing the dating pool; it's about personal compatibility and what feels right for each individual.\r  \n\r  \nYou were right to speak up and remind your mom that you and your sister have the right to make your own decisions. It's understandable that she may have been defensive, but it's crucial for her to respect your autonomy and understand that your choices may differ from hers. Keep communicating your boundaries and asserting your independence. Just like the diverse trees in a forest, everyone has their own unique preferences when it comes to relationships.", "NTA\n\nyour sister is entitled to decide for herself what is or isn't a dealbreaker for her when considering a relationship.

One- if she's pregnant, they were just together in the last few months. what if they want to work it out. Too fresh for a new relationship and Two- I wouldn't want my daughter to be chasing someone who needs to be focusing on the baby. but the ex and him need to straighten things out before they move on. parenting plans, needs for the baby, ect. The last thing your sister needs to do is get herself into messy baby drama. No saying the ex is crazy but stuff needs to be addressed for the baby's sake. Plus she set a hard boundary so all of those things are irrelevant for her anyway.", "It\u2019s huge responsibility to take on someone else\u2019s kid. You and your sister are very smart. Stick to your guns. NTA", "Your mom sounds like my mom. \"Well I wish I had done that\" or \"I did this and it worked for me\" or \"I wish I'd had an opportunity like that, you have to take it\".

From what I know once he knew there was a no way from my sister, he went on dates with some other woman. My mom and his mom were so disappointed because they wanted it to be my sister.", "Well, yes, but I thought that was implied. Nothing about what qualities you look for in a partner, nothing about this appealing person you've found on Tinder who might fit the bill, nothing about which outfit you should wear for your first date next week. NOTHING. Wait until there's some family function that you'd like to bring them along to (or at least, that you don't think you can avoid bringing them to), and then mention their name to Mom for the first time.", "\ud83e\udd2e.\n\nI can\u2019t wrap my head around your mom being cool with him abandoning his responsibilities and wanting her daughter to be next in line.", "I wouldn\u2019t even do that.

One slip up can cause serious problems.", "NTA\n\nIt changes everything if they have a child. And if he's about to have a baby that's huge. Caring for children is a whole ass lifestyle and your mother acting like it's a non issue if you're not into that lifestyle is absurd. She's definitely projecting and being butthurt likening this situation to herself.", "NTA. \n\nNot dating people who have kids - particularly young kids - is a totally reasonable boundary, especially for someone in their 20s. That aside, the fact that he's SO freshly out of that other relationship to where he didn't find out she was pregnant until after they split tells me that this is a situation with messy potential all over it. \n\nBut in any case, even if the ex wasn't pregnant, your sister is perfectly free to decide who she does and does not want to date for any reason at all. Your mom got to date (and marry) the person she wanted, she needs to give your sister space to do the same thing.", "NTA.  People with children do deserve happiness.  Everyone deserves happiness.  But you don't get to demand your happiness come from another person.\n\nI am TBH taken aback by your mom's reaction to this.  Like, dating a guy with children is one thing.  Dating a guy with a VERY recent ex where your sister has no idea how the parenting relationship will shake out because it hasn't started yet is totally another.  The guy has bigger issues going on in his life and starting a new serious relationship is the last thing he should be focusing on right now.", "NTA, your mother is overly involved in your lives.  You're adults.", "NTA because your sister is actually being responsible instead of forcing herself to date someone she doesn't want to be with that has a kid. And you both have to make your own decisions you're not kids.", "NTA....100% \nYour sister knows what she wants and she is wise to be resolute", "NTA. Your mother does not have the right to interfere in the lives of her adult children. I really wish I could give my wonderful mom a hug right now. She was always loving and supportive.\n\nBesides, why would anyone choose to enter a relationship with someone who will have to share a great deal of his time and income with another family? If you fall in love with someone who has an ex and kids you accept this, but  it is not a situation that I would walk into if I could easily avoid all the complications by not dating that person. Especially if I did not like kids and would resent the time and financial support they would need.", "Mom needs to mind her own and let her daughters run their own lives. I totally agree, don't date men who have dependent children.", "This might just be me, but I don't go for women that are fresh out of relationships. I like to see at least 2 months that they haven't had contact with their ex. Given that OP's daughter found out his ex is pregnant while they were in the beginning stages of dating, I don't think I could shake the mental image of him screwing another woman if I were her.", "There's a big difference dating someone who has a pregnant ex. An ex who is pregnant with presumably his first child, which means he has no idea how he is going to feel or what commitments he needs to make with time, emotions and money to both his child and its mother.\n\nIt is a messy situation that has disaster written all over it. I would not want my daughter mixed up in it no matter how nice the guy might be.", "Maybe so but it is totally okay to know what you want in a partner and if kids of any age are a deal breaker mom should accept that and stfu.", "Exactly. OP's sister is 26! Not wanting to date a man with a yet-to-be-born child is not overly narrowing your dating pool.", "Yeah, not wanting to step into a coparenting situation is understandable. You aren't just dating a man, you have a direct line into a relationship with his child & BM. That's a lot of moving parts.", "I think he's still in touch with the ex. Just not getting back with her but will be there for the baby."]}
