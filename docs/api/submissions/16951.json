You know it, but you won't convince her of that.\n\nSo I'd stop trying to reason with her. I recommend the following:\n\n1) You and your sister should stop sharing with your mother any information about who you're dating, at least in the early stages of a relationship. Wait until you're sure it's serious before introducing them to your mother or even mentioning their name. I did that with my own mother - not because she interfered (she didn't), but because she is a terrible gossip and I didn't want every member of our large extended family and every one of her friends knowing my private business. The only relationship of mine she ever knew about was one very long-term relationship.\n\n2) You should refuse point blank to engage in conversation with your mother about your sister's relationships, and your sister should do the same about yours. If your mother happens to find out something about your sister, doesn't approve, and wants to vent to you, you simply say \"This is not a topic for discussion, Mom.\" If she continues, walk out of the room. Hang up the phone. Whatever. And get your sister to do the same if Mom tries to vent to her about you.\n\nMom will soon stop interfering if she's getting no information and no reaction from either of you.", "NTA.

You guys were nice enough to not say the obvious because we already have seen what happens in those relationships.", "NTA. It's important for individuals to have autonomy over their own lives and make decisions based on their own preferences and values. Your mom's enthusiasm and projection of her own experiences onto your sister were not respectful of her choices. Your sister made it clear that she has always had a preference regarding dating someone with kids, and that's completely valid. It's not about judging people harshly or narrowing the dating pool; it's about personal compatibility and what feels right for each individual.\r  \n\r  \nYou were right to speak up and remind your mom that you and your sister have the right to make your own decisions. It's understandable that she may have been defensive, but it's crucial for her to respect your autonomy and understand that your choices may differ from hers. Keep communicating your boundaries and asserting your independence. Just like the diverse trees in a forest, everyone has their own unique preferences when it comes to relationships.", "NTA\n\nyour sister is entitled to decide for herself what is or isn't a dealbreaker for her when considering a relationship.
