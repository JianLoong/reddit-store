This wasn\u2019t as much about parenting as you seem to think.", "I couldn\u2019t imagine walking up to my husbands boss\u2019s girlfriend and ask her to put something on in her own home! What gives anyone that right? \nBeing around that would be uncomfortable so either you avoid where she is or simply leave but saying something is not an option for me. It\u2019s the boss\u2019s gf, common sense tells me to keep my mouth shut", "Even so. It's not like children and breasts don't belong together.", "Yup. \"Basically\" could imply a lot", ">So what? Men go around shirtless ALL THE TIME\n\nWhen's the last time you took off your shirt(and trousers) during a party with your wife's/girlfriend's colleagues and their families? Alternatively, how pleased would you be if your husband/boyfriend just stripped while you had your team over?", "I was merely pointing out an inaccuracy. If you comprehended I made no judgment. Only restated what OP said.", "OP clarified that she was topless in just her panties.", "\u201cBasically\u201d meaning not even that", "A bikini is literally a bra + panties.", "No, it's most assuredly not the same thing, and you're basing an opinion off of an unverified assumption.\n\nThe answer is strictly binary: \"yes\" or \"no\".\n\nThis Puritanical slut shaming nonsense has to stop, regardless.", "Lol if I saw the host of a party do this, I would just politely leave. Grab the kids, grab the husband, thank the boss for inviting us but say we have to get the kids home early.\n\nIdk how old these people are, but stripping down at parties stops being appropriate when it's a work event and when you stop going to college parties. And even if it wasn't sexual, I don't care to be around barely clothed people.", "It's one factor. Looks. Shared interests. Whether you come together after one person gets a lot of money. They all add up right?", "That may be true.. but the argument above is that you don't critisize authority regardless of how authentic that critisizum may or may not be. The bit in italics might as well have been *Don't you know who you were talking to???*", "oh i definitely couldn't do it either.   i think you've flipped my opinion to YTA.", "Right? I would be like \u201clovely panties girl\u201d lol", "Could easily be a bikini", "She\u2019s the bosses girlfriend so they weren\u2019t her colleagues and just because you or I wouldn\u2019t do something doesn\u2019t make another person not entitled to do so.\nYou can make boundaries for yourself but you cannot impose them on others. If you are uncomfortable with what someone else chooses to do (unless they are harming someone) it\u2019s on you to take yourself out of the situation not on the other person to change there behaviour to make you comfortable", "Other than material what is the actual difference between underwear and swim suits though? I have some underwear that covers up more than some swimsuits\u2026", "i really don't know what \"basically\" just her panties means then.  she had a top on but OP still wrote \"basically\" just her panties when in reality she had a full swimsuit on?   that would be odd phrasing then.", "it is not puritanical to not want that around a child.  different beliefs.  chill.", "You don\u2019t criticize someone who is just living their life absolutely bothering no one just because you\u2019re an envious AH. That makes you an asshole. Needlessly antagonizing someone in a position of financial power over you makes you a DUMB asshole.", "When they are the source of your livelihood? You absolutely keep your fucking mouth shut. It's a no brainier. Never bite the hand that feeds you.\n\nPeople need to realize real life is not Reddit.", "Right!\nSuck up to her, not piss her off!!", "Yeah that's what I'm thinking. I think OP is just super jealous.", "Saying \u201cbasically her panties\u201d instead of just saying what she was actually wearing is just weird overall. When someone says something is \u201cbasically\u201d something, that generally means it\u2019s not that at all, but they want to say it\u2019s almost like it. You\u2019re either in your panties or you aren\u2019t. It\u2019s pretty straightforward.", "well exactly.  we need clarification.", "OP finally clarified in another comment. The gf was topless."]}
