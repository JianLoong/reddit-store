Use that for anything that might trigger the Ex and let the kids see any other generic items.\n\nThe the real issue is that your Fianc\u00e9 has to not engage with her about these issues.

Looking at your post history makes me feel bad for you, honestly. One of my friends was in a similar situation and it was so bad. After a while she got tired of putting up with all that crap and moved back to our town with their daughter. He followed her here and now they're trying to rebuild their marriage because they really are in love with each other, but we'll see. I'd hate for them to separate because they're one of those couples that you can feel they're in love just by looking at them, but his kids are horrid.

It is difficult to have someone be so angry and jealous.  I highly recommend seeing a specialized therapist in blended families.  You are going to be in their lives, and she will be in yours forever.  My husband's ex was a trainwreck.  She barely saw her child.  She isn't in her child's life much anymore, but she tries to come to the big things (graduations, etc) and we have to deal with her.", "NTA in this specific scenario, but I looked over your post history and...wow. This doesn't sound like a healthy situation for anyone involved.", "NTA how old are these kids? Why do they have Instagram?", "Why are you even posting this?  You know the answer", "Nta if she is using it to spy on you, you should make it so she cannot see them", "NTA. but is this what you want? A fiance who doesn't think it's necessary to stop his ex-wife's bullshit and defend you. Gross, messy, disrespectful kids who you hate and the ex wife who is a fucking nutcase. You straight up said in a previous post that you're the one who primarily takes care of your daughter. What does that man bring to the table other than agitation and exhausting people?\n\nIs this really what you want? You deserve to be with someone who loves you without bringing their miserable baggage along with them.\n\nRun. Please do yourself a favor and run. You'll be an asshole to YOURSELF if you stick around in this misery.", "Yta..check her post history. She doesn't like having her fiance have children. She doesn't even like her stepchildren.

I always like reminding my spouse's ex that I have my own job and money, so how I spend it is as I see fit.  Good luck, she'll probably find another way to spy.  Your fiance needs to document it all in case he wants to go for primary later or in case she decides to try and come after him for money.", "Agreed!\nNTA and maybe the father needs a real custody agreement (OP didn't say if it was a formal or informal custody agreement) with a judge so she won't have the means to sue him over this.", "It\u2019s been 4 years. I have yet to meet the woman because I refuse to at this point. I\u2019ve a mind to spit in her eye. But he knows.

Trust me it\u2019s too young without supervision. Not in this world.", "Yes it\u2019s legally a 50/50 judge/court agreement.", "Good. She doesn't need to be crying to him about anything.", "If she can't handle them two weeks in a row, there is also something wrong which needs to be addressed. What happens, if mom gets ill and they are there even longer?", "Even with supervision, I don\u2019t see a reason for a 10 year old to have an Instagram account. That sounds really inappropriate. I hope of you and your fianc\u00e9 have kids that you don\u2019t put them on social media like that at such a young age. IG is for 13+", "Idk, but reading op's posts, those kids are horrible. I wouldn't want them in my house for too long either. Altough her husband has a fault in this too, since he barely parents them, but i would rather take my daughter and get the hell out of there.", "I just read the titles and some of her comments. This doesn't speak for a functional family..."]}
