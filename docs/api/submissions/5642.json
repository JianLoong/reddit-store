I\u2019ve had it three times and each time I feel horrendous and even walking to the toilet wipes me out. \n\nMy daughter (8) had covid as the same time the first time around and she had no symptoms other than mild loss of taste. \n\nMy husband and son moved out for the week so they could continue as normal and me and my daughter could move freely around the house. We lived in take aways because I couldn\u2019t move to cook. \n\nSecond time around I had it with my husband. The kids moved to their grandparents and went to school etc. Again I was wiped out for a week, my husband was wiped out for all of 24 hours and then he felt right as rain again. No excuse for me to by take aways that time around lol he cooked me some lovely meals and looked after me whilst we were both stuck indoors", "NTA. Getting respectfully called out for her behaviour and then resorting to crying screams selfish", "NTA. I\u2019m still not understanding the difference she\u2019s saying. So she didn\u2019t want to cook while you had covid?", "NTA. You deserve better treatment and care than she has given you.", "NTA. My husband and father had covid this month, my father tested positive first and my husband 4 days latter. We live in the same apartment so there isn\u2019t enough room to juggle 5 people. My father was isolated in his room, my husband in our room, my mother in the living room (she had symptoms and had to wait before getting tested after 3 days showing and retested 3 days later because first was negative) so I was doing everything in our house: cooking, cleaning, taking care of my son and working a 7to5 job. Not once I complained about it, all I wanted was to my family to get better.\n\nI felt sick right after they got better, did my husband or father complained I want to be pampered? Hell no. Quite the contrary, they took care of me because they knew I caught the flu (tested negative to covid) due overworking for 18 days straight. \n\nYour wife is a huge AH. Even if I am mad at my husband or father when they are sick. I would never not bring them food, water, medication, \nask how they are feeling or if they need anything\u2026 even with covid I would constantly knock on their door offering to bring a water, juice, tea, hot cocoa. \n\nI\u2019m sorry for you OP because this type of behavior never goes away\u2026", "INFO: what were some of the things she complained about? I feel we\u2019re missing her side of the story.", "NTA, I have had it 4 times. The first time I could not function and the 2nd I barely noticed. It affects everyone differently and your wife should know that with all the reports of deaths vs people not even showing symptoms. My husband and I took care of each other and three kids who all had it at the same time. Is she always like this? Has she ever displayed empathy to you?", "NTA- Your wife doesn't seems the caring type. You are sick and obviously bummed about losing the hollidays. It's not cool saying someone is taking their symptoms Just because she had less...", "NTA. Covid affects people differently. It\u2019s definitely possible that you feel worse with it than she did. She should just suck it up and take care of you. \n\nIt\u2019s *never* a good sign when people complain about their partners behind their backs\u2026especially when it\u2019s about things they haven\u2019t mentioned to their face.", "Nta your wife is a capital B", "NTA. My wife and I have a hard policy of not talking about disagreements or each other negatively to people outside our marriage because it should be resolved between us. So to me, she\u2019s the AH for that alone.\n\nNow she won\u2019t even do the bare minimum to help you out during this? Y\u2019all are supposed to be a team. Definitely NTA here.", "NTA. Never had covid but know several friends who have and not everyone reacts the same to it. Some symptoms are mild and in more than 1 case I know of they were hospitalized. NTA. Like you said \"In sickness and in health\".

I think you were right to call her out on it and also to call out her crying as emotional manipulation, because her openly talking about how she thinks you're trying to get out of being a partner and not taking care of you when the shoe was on the other foot is mean spirited. You didn't choose to get sick, it's wrong for your partner not to take care of you because she's mad that she can't follow certain plans without spreading disease", "when your well again think about separation / divorce. what she did was mean and controlling and down right manipulative.  nobody should be treated like that", "This isn't about the difference between hiw sick each one was, it's about how they treated their spouse.

If you said that about her when she was ill, everyone would call you abusive and sexist.

This is toxic as fuck.\nHer priorities seem focused elsewhere too.", "Yeah right. How about power in the relationship? You said she mentioned the patriarchy and you said it\u2019s not what a supportive spouse would do. Is there a patriarchy at play here? Why would she miss out on everything if it\u2019s just you that\u2019s sick? My wife would load me up with tablets, drink and food then head out. \n\nOtherwise it could be that like many friend groups where the thing to do is to hang shade on the partner because it\u2019s cool.
