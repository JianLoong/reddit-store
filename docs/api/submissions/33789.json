This seems... unlikely.\n\nWhere I think you have a legitimate complaint is that your husband seems to prioritize helping Mark during major events in your life.  Mark could have called someone else or even just waited in jail while you were giving birth, and could have paid the extra money to take other transportation to the airport on Christmas morning.  That's how I'd put this: not that Mark is deliberately scheduling things this way (he's not) but that your husband needs to promise that you'll come first, *even if* it means his friend is in a difficult spot.\n\nThis argument on Christmas day was completely over the top, so I'm going with ESH.  You can bring this up in a productive way, but that wasn't it.", "Soft YTA, but your MIL is TA from my opinion.\n\n\nThe comments jumping right to affair are so fucked. \n\n\nYour MIL to me sounds like she has never liked Mark, but he's important to your husband. The birth thing is bad, but you're this upset because he missed a few hours early Christmas morning? \nIt sounds like she came in and riled things up and ruined Christmas because your husband was gone for a few hours early in the morning. Life happens, and she doesn't like that Mark's life is not easy but his friendship matters to him.\nPushing these normative expectations on your husband to abandon relationships that matter aside from his family, and he will be the one divorcing you. That is not a healthy or sustainable marriage in this day and age.\n\nIt does sound like husband needs to not rush to marks aid whenever he calls, but that is something to work on, not punish him for.", "I agree with your awesome MIL", "Your husband is, as you say, staying in a hotel now instead of home with his mother and family over Christmas week. Over his feeling he has to defend his friend. Why do you even want him to come back? It's bad enough that he prioritizes Mark over you; but I would find it unforgiveable that he puts the friendship over his kids. NTA.", "So Mark is in love with your husband, but since apparantly your own parents, your husbands parents and you have mentioned how it is weird that your husband drops everything for him (I\u2019m assuming your MIL only went to talk divorce after she discussed other solutions) and he doesn\u2019t change a thing, I imagine your husband is in love with mark too. \n\nMy husband had an ex who had an emergency every time we went on a date (when we were still dating). When I mentioned that I found it suspicious, he first said something about how helpless that ex was, how she was always in trouble. Two dates later he noticed that there was indeed a pattern, talked to her and she never did it again.", "NTA, and it is an eye opener that your MIL agrees with you.\n\nA little bit of homework for you: write down every single important event that has happened for your family the last couple of years, including kids' sports days, school concerts, family days, birthdays, celebrations, date nights, anniversaries etc. Big or small, it doesn't matter. If you can, remember the dates and have this organised in date order. Then, for each event, write down what 'crisis' it was that Mark had, how long your husband was away for, and how it impacted the plans of the occasion.\n\nNow, depending on how your husband's brain works, you might need a visual representation of the occurrences, like a timeline. Or, if he is a numbers guy, add up how much time has been dedicated to the above family events and then add up how much has been stolen by Mark. Once it is all organised, you need to present it to him.\n\nAnd if your husband is not willing to see reason, this will be good to use as evidence should you decide to go the divorce route.", "Perhaps Mark and your husband are having an affair.   His crises come when you need him too and Perhaps he reaches out because he becomes jealous and insecure.   Do you have proof the crises are real.\n\nNTA.   You and your family deserve better.   Your MIL may know more.", "Your husband is in on the \u201crandom\u201d emergencies. \n\nThey are either having an affair or partying when he should be parenting. \n\nYour MIL is keenly aware of this, as she wasn\u2019t born yesterday. She wants him to be a family man and currently he\u2019s not.", "NTA.\n\nI can't believe your husband is making this a hill he's willing to die on, just out of friendship. \n\nHas he even tried to set boundaries?", "Info: Did I miss where you mentioned you\u2019ve had talks with your husband about this behavior or you and MIL just went right for the death sentence on Christmas up to and including talking about divorce immediately?", "NTA\n\n Mark seems to have a magical ability to turn every occasion into his own personal drama fest. Your husband needs to set boundaries, or Mark might just become your third wheel in the relationship.", "NTA. Your husband could have offered to pay for the Uber. Why is Marc\u2019s mom\u2019s emergency more important than your family? What sort of relationship do they have if he was in foster care growing up?", "It sounds like this question goes way beyond whether you're an asshole for telling husband to ditch Mark. That's just the tip of the iceberg. You have some pretty foundational questions to address, like do you even want to stay married?", "NTA, Mark knows exactly what he is doing and that husband would drop everything and everyone to help him. MIL is right, RUN!", "Wow, your husband's mother is actually telling you to divorce him and she'll back you up? What a refreshing, albeit sad, twist to the standard husband-mother-wife dynamic one usually sees here. Here's the thing - she's not married to him, you are. At a miminum, insist on couples therapy to get at why hubs feels so beholden to Mark he is willing to jeopardize his marriage. He is clearly getting something out of being a savior, or escaping family time, or something. Your MIL means well, but this is your marriage to fight for or give up on. Resist the temptation to ket her fight your battle. NTA for drawing hard boundaries on this. Mark's dramas are pathetic calls for attention, and your husband needs to see them for what they are and learn to say no. Mark is likely way more resourceful than your husband gives him credit for! Hubs needs to learn skills to deal with Mark.", "NTA. You sure won the MIL lottery. About Mark: maybe your husband has no backbone and boundaries -- he couldn't help that Mark had an emergency? Uber is expensive, and that's more important than Christmas morning with his family? -- or maybe there is something else going on. My father had a best friend who was always around, and they went on business trips and sometimes vacations together, and it just felt like his friend was a too-important part of our family. I was a kid and liked him well enough; my mother never said anything. Years later, after we immigrated to the U.S. from a country where homosexuality was a felony punishable by imprisonment, after my father's death, my mother and I compared notes and agreed that they were probably boyfriends. I don't know if that's applicable here, but either way, your husband's priorities are weird. But at least you have your awesome MIL in your corner.", "ESH \n\nMark has issues, dont think i need to elaborate. \n\nYour MIL decided to convince you to divorce and 'financially ruin' (obviously she has no influence over the laws calculating possible alimony or child support) him, and you were on board? \nShe hates Mark so much she would break up her grandkids family out of spite. \n\nHe was not there for 3 hours out of what? 48? 72? Nevermind his mother is staying for over a week.. \n\nYour husband obviously considers mark a brother and has role conflicts because he needs to be there for both you and him. Would you ditch your sister in an emergency to have breakfast? \n\nTo accuse him of 'cheating' is wild. MIL and you value family time so much that you made him leave the house for the vacation, that really brings the point across. \n\nI want to stress this: You're absolutely not wrong for being annoyed that Mark always has an emergency that makes your husband miss family time, and its totally fair to tell your husband this and have your husband tell Mark in advance that he is not available. (Idk how obvious it really is, in your post it sounds like he 100% only has emergencies when your husband is doing family stuff. If its really clear like that he should talk to Mark about that too.)\n\nBut MILs input was way over the top and your response of escalating the conflict in the holiday was not ideal, the result was bad too.", "NTA.\n\nHe's staying away until you apologize? Wow. He should ba apologizing to you, his mother, and his kids.\n\nHe said he couldn't help that Mark had an emergency on a holiday. Well, that's true, but he CAN help how he responds to these emergencies. Maybe next time his help can be \"I'll order an uber for you, and Venmo $20 if you need help with the cost.\"", "NTA mark is a major main character in your marriage and your MIL knows this.", "NTA. Is it possible your husband and his friend are more than just friends?", "NTA. Honestly I would have divorced him to ditching you at the hospital to bail his friend out of jail. That was absolutely inexcusable. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong here, and you weren\u2019t obligated to defend him when his mother was correctly pointing out how fucked up his behavior is.", "Agreed. NTA.", "I was coming here to post this very thing.  I think Mark and the husband have been in a relationship since they were young and the MIL knows it.", "Hi Mark!", "\"Might\" become? Mark is the big wheel on the tricycle", "Legit. It all makes sense to me. Like on his kids birth he just HASSS to go \"help\" mark. I lost my sympathy long ago for closet cases. Like if you live in place where its illegal to be gay then i get it but if you live in a Western country and your doing this then your a sad lair.", "Winner winner chicken dinner."]}
