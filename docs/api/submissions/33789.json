This seems... unlikely.\n\nWhere I think you have a legitimate complaint is that your husband seems to prioritize helping Mark during major events in your life.  Mark could have called someone else or even just waited in jail while you were giving birth, and could have paid the extra money to take other transportation to the airport on Christmas morning.  That's how I'd put this: not that Mark is deliberately scheduling things this way (he's not) but that your husband needs to promise that you'll come first, *even if* it means his friend is in a difficult spot.\n\nThis argument on Christmas day was completely over the top, so I'm going with ESH.  You can bring this up in a productive way, but that wasn't it.", "Soft YTA, but your MIL is TA from my opinion.\n\n\nThe comments jumping right to affair are so fucked. \n\n\nYour MIL to me sounds like she has never liked Mark, but he's important to your husband. The birth thing is bad, but you're this upset because he missed a few hours early Christmas morning? \nIt sounds like she came in and riled things up and ruined Christmas because your husband was gone for a few hours early in the morning. Life happens, and she doesn't like that Mark's life is not easy but his friendship matters to him.\nPushing these normative expectations on your husband to abandon relationships that matter aside from his family, and he will be the one divorcing you. That is not a healthy or sustainable marriage in this day and age.\n\nIt does sound like husband needs to not rush to marks aid whenever he calls, but that is something to work on, not punish him for.", "I agree with your awesome MIL", "Your husband is, as you say, staying in a hotel now instead of home with his mother and family over Christmas week. Over his feeling he has to defend his friend. Why do you even want him to come back? It's bad enough that he prioritizes Mark over you; but I would find it unforgiveable that he puts the friendship over his kids. NTA.", "So Mark is in love with your husband, but since apparantly your own parents, your husbands parents and you have mentioned how it is weird that your husband drops everything for him (I\u2019m assuming your MIL only went to talk divorce after she discussed other solutions) and he doesn\u2019t change a thing, I imagine your husband is in love with mark too. \n\nMy husband had an ex who had an emergency every time we went on a date (when we were still dating). When I mentioned that I found it suspicious, he first said something about how helpless that ex was, how she was always in trouble. Two dates later he noticed that there was indeed a pattern, talked to her and she never did it again.", "NTA, and it is an eye opener that your MIL agrees with you.\n\nA little bit of homework for you: write down every single important event that has happened for your family the last couple of years, including kids' sports days, school concerts, family days, birthdays, celebrations, date nights, anniversaries etc. Big or small, it doesn't matter. If you can, remember the dates and have this organised in date order. Then, for each event, write down what 'crisis' it was that Mark had, how long your husband was away for, and how it impacted the plans of the occasion.\n\nNow, depending on how your husband's brain works, you might need a visual representation of the occurrences, like a timeline. Or, if he is a numbers guy, add up how much time has been dedicated to the above family events and then add up how much has been stolen by Mark. Once it is all organised, you need to present it to him.\n\nAnd if your husband is not willing to see reason, this will be good to use as evidence should you decide to go the divorce route.", "Perhaps Mark and your husband are having an affair.   His crises come when you need him too and Perhaps he reaches out because he becomes jealous and insecure.   Do you have proof the crises are real.\n\nNTA.   You and your family deserve better.   Your MIL may know more.", "Your husband is in on the \u201crandom\u201d emergencies. \n\nThey are either having an affair or partying when he should be parenting. \n\nYour MIL is keenly aware of this, as she wasn\u2019t born yesterday. She wants him to be a family man and currently he\u2019s not.", "NTA.\n\nI can't believe your husband is making this a hill he's willing to die on, just out of friendship. \n\nHas he even tried to set boundaries?", "Info: Did I miss where you mentioned you\u2019ve had talks with your husband about this behavior or you and MIL just went right for the death sentence on Christmas up to and including talking about divorce immediately?", "NTA\n\n Mark seems to have a magical ability to turn every occasion into his own personal drama fest. Your husband needs to set boundaries, or Mark might just become your third wheel in the relationship.", "NTA. Your husband could have offered to pay for the Uber. Why is Marc\u2019s mom\u2019s emergency more important than your family? What sort of relationship do they have if he was in foster care growing up?", "It sounds like this question goes way beyond whether you're an asshole for telling husband to ditch Mark. That's just the tip of the iceberg. You have some pretty foundational questions to address, like do you even want to stay married?", "NTA, Mark knows exactly what he is doing and that husband would drop everything and everyone to help him. MIL is right, RUN!", "Wow, your husband's mother is actually telling you to divorce him and she'll back you up? What a refreshing, albeit sad, twist to the standard husband-mother-wife dynamic one usually sees here. Here's the thing - she's not married to him, you are. At a miminum, insist on couples therapy to get at why hubs feels so beholden to Mark he is willing to jeopardize his marriage. He is clearly getting something out of being a savior, or escaping family time, or something. Your MIL means well, but this is your marriage to fight for or give up on. Resist the temptation to ket her fight your battle. NTA for drawing hard boundaries on this. Mark's dramas are pathetic calls for attention, and your husband needs to see them for what they are and learn to say no. Mark is likely way more resourceful than your husband gives him credit for! Hubs needs to learn skills to deal with Mark.", "NTA. You sure won the MIL lottery. About Mark: maybe your husband has no backbone and boundaries -- he couldn't help that Mark had an emergency? Uber is expensive, and that's more important than Christmas morning with his family? -- or maybe there is something else going on. My father had a best friend who was always around, and they went on business trips and sometimes vacations together, and it just felt like his friend was a too-important part of our family. I was a kid and liked him well enough; my mother never said anything. Years later, after we immigrated to the U.S. from a country where homosexuality was a felony punishable by imprisonment, after my father's death, my mother and I compared notes and agreed that they were probably boyfriends. I don't know if that's applicable here, but either way, your husband's priorities are weird. But at least you have your awesome MIL in your corner.", "ESH \n\nMark has issues, dont think i need to elaborate. \n\nYour MIL decided to convince you to divorce and 'financially ruin' (obviously she has no influence over the laws calculating possible alimony or child support) him, and you were on board? \nShe hates Mark so much she would break up her grandkids family out of spite. \n\nHe was not there for 3 hours out of what? 48? 72? Nevermind his mother is staying for over a week.. \n\nYour husband obviously considers mark a brother and has role conflicts because he needs to be there for both you and him. Would you ditch your sister in an emergency to have breakfast? \n\nTo accuse him of 'cheating' is wild. MIL and you value family time so much that you made him leave the house for the vacation, that really brings the point across. \n\nI want to stress this: You're absolutely not wrong for being annoyed that Mark always has an emergency that makes your husband miss family time, and its totally fair to tell your husband this and have your husband tell Mark in advance that he is not available. (Idk how obvious it really is, in your post it sounds like he 100% only has emergencies when your husband is doing family stuff. If its really clear like that he should talk to Mark about that too.)\n\nBut MILs input was way over the top and your response of escalating the conflict in the holiday was not ideal, the result was bad too.", "NTA.\n\nHe's staying away until you apologize? Wow. He should ba apologizing to you, his mother, and his kids.\n\nHe said he couldn't help that Mark had an emergency on a holiday. Well, that's true, but he CAN help how he responds to these emergencies. Maybe next time his help can be \"I'll order an uber for you, and Venmo $20 if you need help with the cost.\"", "NTA mark is a major main character in your marriage and your MIL knows this.", "NTA. Is it possible your husband and his friend are more than just friends?", "NTA. Honestly I would have divorced him to ditching you at the hospital to bail his friend out of jail. That was absolutely inexcusable. You\u2019ve done nothing wrong here, and you weren\u2019t obligated to defend him when his mother was correctly pointing out how fucked up his behavior is.", "Agreed. NTA.", "I was coming here to post this very thing.  I think Mark and the husband have been in a relationship since they were young and the MIL knows it.", "Hi Mark!", "\"Might\" become? Mark is the big wheel on the tricycle", "Legit. It all makes sense to me. Like on his kids birth he just HASSS to go \"help\" mark. I lost my sympathy long ago for closet cases. Like if you live in place where its illegal to be gay then i get it but if you live in a Western country and your doing this then your a sad lair.", "Winner winner chicken dinner.", "NTA\n\nOne of two things are going on here. \n\nThe first is that your husband and Mark are more than just friends. \n\nThe second, and more likely one is obvious. Your husband has a parasite. I know the type. I know a guy just like Mark. \n\nI am in a circle of guy friends. We are all pretty tight. There are 4 of us. One of them, \"Steve\" has had problems ever since I knew him. Chronic unemployment being the main one, likely fueled by depression or narcissism. Part of the reason he is unemployed so much is that he tends to quit jobs within the first few weeks, saying how much it sucked. When he IS working, he's underemployed. He's a smart guy. Holds a bachelor's degree. But his employment record is such a mess and he's now in his mid 50's all he gets are low paying jobs. He's is currently working, I think earning about 25 dollars an hour doing something menial.  It's not enough to live comfortably on in the city he lives. \n\nSteve has always been closest with \"Derek\". Derek has what I call a \"fixer\" personality. He likes people he can take care of. Has a very generous nature. Steve has always taken advantage of Derek. For money, for a place to live several times, giving him a place to go at christmas, when we go on trips, I usually find out Derek has fully or mostly paid Steve's way. Steve NEVER pays Derek back. Steve acts entitled to Derek's \"help\" all the time.\n\nIt's clear that Derek is a \"proxy parent\" to Steve. Parasitic people will cling to someone who can replace their parents initially as a last resort, but eventually the first and only resort. The person to live with when they face eviction or the street, which is pretty often.  The bank when real banks will deny them. The proxy parent becomes not just a friend, but a source of income and support. A plan. I have even heard Steve say things like \"Hell with this job, I can just move in with Derek\" when Derek has a live in girlfriend and he hasn't actually discussed it with Derek. Derek is an *assumed* support system. \n\nThis is all forgivable in your 20's. Couch surfing for a year or two between buddies in your youth. But we are in our 50's now. It's well past that time for us. Long past the time we should have had our shit together. Steve just never got his shit together, and has managed to survive by sucking the blood of Derek. A proxy-parent. \n\nWhen the Proxy-parent has their own family and responsibilities, the blood the parasite sucks also comes from the family. There is no reason a spouse in a partnership needs to sacrifice their own finances, peace, stability and home for someone who couldn't pull it together in life. The proxy parent now hurts their own family. \n\nThe line has to be drawn. A proxy parent can sacrifice all they want of their own resources to a parasite. But they have no right to sacrifice anyone else's to a parasite. \n\nYour husband is the proxy parent. And Mark will keep taking because your husband will clearly not stop giving. \n\nYou really need to put your foot down. I am not one for ultimatums, but this is an ultimatum situation.\n\nSide note, you can check if the DUI actually happened in some states. If yours is one, check. I would also start verifying any other \"emergencies\" to the best of your ability.", "He's staying away from his family in a hotel over Christmas? \n\nAre you sure Mark even left town? This seems like a huge coincidence. \n\nMark routinely interrupts family time and your husband willingly leaves his family and flies to  his aid. Your own mil called you a \"third wheel\". Time to assess what's really going on.", "NTA\n\nYour husband left you & your newborn to bail his friend out of a dui?\n\nThen leaves to sort another crisis at Christmas/there have been numerous other instances of Mark intruding.  Even your MIL seems to be urging divorce!\n\nIs it possible Mark is more than a friend?\n\nIt seems you are facing a really tough situation here. It's imperative you find out what's really behind this if possible  & go from there.\n\nAt least you will have other family support which is something.", "NTA but I don\u2019t think your ultimatum will work, he\u2019s clearly shown time and time again that he prioritises Mark over you and your family\n\nLeaving you immediately after a birth to bail him out is unforgivable as far as I\u2019m concerned, that tells me everything I need to know. Sounds like Mark got jealous and either got in trouble because he couldn\u2019t regulate his emotions or fabricated some bs to pull your husband away from a milestone event.", "Wow, it's really really telling that it's your MIL, your husband's mother, was the one who laid into him and even told him she'd support you in a divorce..\n\nYour husband missed his children opening gifts because Mark needed a lift. Why wasn't sending him the money for the Uber even an option??\n\nIf this is the hill he wants to die on, let him, but your MIL is right, you are his wife and should not be the third wheel in this scenario.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Have you considered hiring a private investigator to tail hubby the next time he has to leave for one of Mark's emergencies? If they happen on major family events like clockwork, it's especially easy to set up. But even if there's not an affair going on (with Mark or possibly with someone that hubby is just SAYING is Mark), you need to lay down better boundaries (or more realistically, help your husband lay down better boundaries). No way would I let my husband leave the hospital during birth because his buddy got himself into trouble with a DUI.", "NTA. Your husband is prioritizing Mark like Mark is his spouse. \n\nThe Christmas issue would've been more understanding if there wasn't a history of these things. It's also telling your husband is choosing to stay in a hotel, at Christmas, rather than be at home with his and your kids.", "NTA - your husband is either having an affair with Mark OR having an affair with someone else and using Mark as a scapegoat.\n\nWhy the hell would he use an argument with MIL as an excuse to go stay in a hotel for the holidays? Not to mention, leaving his KIDS alone on Christmas morning and the rest of the break? Even if he isn\u2019t cheating (he is) BUT for arguments sake he\u2019s not, this is unacceptable.", "You need to find out \"who\" is this Mark to your husband. Like his dedication for Mark is extraordinary. Of course i agree with your mil on the divorce.  NTA", "NTA but this isn't a Mark problem. This is a husband problem. Your MIL is right. DH has had multiple chances to put you first and hasn't.", "NTA, and since he chose to go to a hotel and not stay with you and your kids, says a lot about him. I personally would tell him to come get the rest of his stuff now while you have his mom there because he made his choice, IMO.  He left the house because you didn't stand up for him and wanted an apology from his mom, just proves to me that he has deep feelings for Mark and puts above anyone else. It will NEVER change. Tell him to come get his stuff now and that you will be finding an attorney to file for divorce.", "NTA, real Brokeback mountain vibes here. get out, now.\n\nEdited to add: also I don\u2019t get how if Mark was in a \u201cfoster home\u201d that his \u201cmother\u201d is having an emergency on Christmas that would cause this \u201cbroke\u201d guy to have to buy a no-notice plane ticket on Christmas? So much does not add up in this story. Should have had your husband followed to find out the real story, because he apparently has no interest in telling you (or his mother) what is really going on.

Wish him and Mark a happy life togther and tell them to get gone.", "NTA. He's setting himself on fire to keep mark warm and likely feels justified because mark's a charity case and he's the good friend coming to his rescue.

He decided playing chauffer to bus his friend to the airport is more important than spending the holiday with his family. \n\nIts not that helping his friend is the problem, its how he is choosing to help that is problematic. Put the friend in an uber to send them one way to the airport instead of driving the round trip yourself!", "Mark is an IDIOT for drinking and driving in the goddamn first place.", "Your mom has a medical emergency on Christmas Day; you pay for Uber (or if they have peak prices, take a cab). And yes, if he knew they were having a baby, got shitfaced and then drove around it would be pretty obvious what the consequences are", "She's brought it up. Hubs is lucky he's not in the midst of a divorce over the dui incident. Then he runs off to do Mark's bidding on Christmas? If it were me he wouldn't have gotten into an argument with his mother because he wouldn't have gotten back into the house in the first place. Tone and \"appropriate time\" policing OP over hubby's egregious behavior is asinine. Do better.", "Hi, mark!", ">Mark uses this emergencies to hijack important events from your husband\n\nI was reading it the other way - that Husband was using Mark as an excuse to get out of important events. \n\nI mean, how could Mark know that OP was in the hospital unless Husband told him? How could Mark PLAN on getting a DUI at just that time? That's much too complicated - it's much simpler to think that the impetus is coming from Husband, not Mark.", "I agree! Some people just love to be the centre of attention and suck up all the attention they can get, this sounds like Mark. They are draining and they always ruin other people's relationships.  Mark is the kind of person you go nc with, not lc, but nc because any time or attention would fuel him. If OP's  husband is unable to go nc with Mark this relationship is over. The fact the MIL is on OP's side speaks volumes.  OP leave him to sulk alone in the hotel waiting for a apology that will not come. He should be apologising to you and MIL not the other way round.", "Even if the husband doesn't ditch him, set some boundaries so certain events can never be interrupted by a \"crisis\".\n\nOP, maybe a calendar where you print off month by month and big red squares showing the event and emergency.  Tape it to a wall.  Visuals are great things.", "Or that Mark wishes that was the case", "[removed]", "The follow on question\u2026 has she met Mark in real life? Does he exist?", "This is a very valid question.", "Holy cow, OP's husband probably has Mark call with \"an emergency\" anytime he has family time; he's been doing this forever. Has anyone met Mark? Maybe it's Markie lol!", "I was thinking the same thing", "I\u2019d say the chance is at least seven.", "Or that Mark is Olivia from accounting?", "That's where my mind went.", "Or that Mark has a hold on hubby from being a witness to a \u201cbad decision event\u201d in their younger years?", "or he's just a really loyal friend trying to help his buddy", "Yikes, this is a lot of judgment against bi people for absolutely no reason.", ">Could she or someone else sit in a corner of the lobby,\n\nWhat does this achieve though? Closure maybe I guess, but if it gets to a point where you need to do this the marriage is fucked beyond recovery anyway and the outcome is going to be the same either way", "The 1st paragraph is the entirety of the issue. OP doesn't have a Mark problem, she has a Hubby problem. \u00a0**He'd rather spend time with the other person than with his own wife** (hours after surgical delivery) **and kids** during Christmas, the most family-centric holiday of the year! Hubby's reaction is so over-the-top that it really draws attention to how absurd the situation is. Perhaps he *wants* the divorce, so he's free to spend even more time with \"Mark\" (or whoever) without being questioned about it. If hubby isn't guilty of anything other than bending over backwards to help a \"friend\" (who reciprocates, when?) why can't he see that is choosing to abandon his family at critical times rather than lay boundaries and prioritize them? Something fishy is going on!", "No way Mark or whomever it is knows about important events and conveniently calls at those times. Husband is letting Mark know to call so they can be together. Woo wee this is a doozie and we all need to be updated.", "We all know he\u2019s there", "Schmart room.", "My exact thought.", "Yea he should of let his irresponsible ass sit in jail.", "Yes, get into the phone bill, credit card bills, and bank accounts to see what is being spent where. \n\nAnd if she doesn't have access because she doesn't handle that stuff, change that.", "I thought the same thing. My son has 3 kids and is currently unemployed due to the factory closing its doors. It's a hard world out here believe it.", "Inflation mostly. In general, pandemic driven, and market driven.", "Must live in California.\n\nE: Jeeze. Who knew guessing one of the four states where a \"livable\" wage is over $21 and one of two states where you can rent a closet for $1000/mo. would upset people.", "Bear in mind that it can take several weeks from the arrest to appear on the site. I would check in late January.", "Markarita.", "Right? Has she ever met \"Mark\"?", "That was one of the questions my husband had when I first brought it up. But, weekend days, his WhatsApp status showing he hadn\u2019t been online a couple of hours. Posting a location on Facebook, those things were a safe bet. \n\nBut it even happened that he declined a call, alles it was because of a date and next thing she was having suicidal thoughts.", "Yeah, exactly. I wouldn\u2019t be rushing to bail someone like that out!", "This, this right here. Seriously think of doing this. And don't tell anyone, not even your parents or his mom.   Things have a strange way of getting leaked, even under the best of intentions.  I think Mark is real (his mom has known him since he was a kid so obviously it's a real male person)  so either Mark is his lover or Mark is helping the husband to have an affair ,and is the excuse to get out of the house.  Please listen to southofmemphis", "Very good points i love when someone points out something i never thought of. I have red a few redits where like the friend or parent has abonnement issues and sabotages there loved ones relationship. Sorry to here about the ex.

Wtf", "I lol'd. Thank you for that.", "The day he left the birth it stopped being a boundaries issue and started being a \u201cyou need therapy, your actually in a relationship with him\u201d", "My first thought is to set and enforce boundaries, then cut Mark off if that tactic fails.", "I think mark is jealous that husband has settled down and had a happy family and now gets to have another one while he is still stuck alone.", "This is my bet. Mark is acting like a jealous lover who keeps finding a reason to come first over the wife. If you do divorce, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they become roommates. Then your ex to be shocked when Mark makes a move on him some night, carefully planned to blame on being \u201ctoo drunk\u201d if he\u2019s unsuccessful", "lol was looking for this comment", "Oh man, I remember that story. That dude was so obviously, painfully in love with his friend even while denying it. He was trying to pass it off as just being a good friend, while also absolutely *gushing* over the guy in a way that people just don\u2019t do for their regular friends. So frustrated for the wife, who not only is witnessing her husband have an obvious emotional affair with another man, but he\u2019s also giving him *her* space in *her* home.", "I love the fact that I know what this means.", "My guess is Yes", "This.  I'm wondering if there's a second family.", "Oooooooh good one.", "If he grew up near a-hole husband, I'd gather that MIL knows him.", "Considering that he is a friend from childhood, there are good odds that MIL knows Mark.", "I would be inclined to talk with Mark and let him know straight up that his behavior is about to cause a family breakup and see if he would back way off with this drama before he ruins a few kids lives\u2026", "Uh yeah the mom.", "It's not about the Irainian yogurt!\n\nMerry Happy All \ud83d\ude09", "Leaving shortly after what sounds like a c-section birth of your child (meaning OP couldn\u2019t do much on her own) to bail a buddy out of jail for something completely of his own making (a DUI) is taking it too far. His first loyalty should be to his wife and children. \n\nNow I do think the speculation is ridiculous. Mark had a hard childhood, husband feels responsible for him, it doesn\u2019t have to be anything more than misprioritized loyalty to a childhood friend. But husband needs to realize, quickly, that he can\u2019t be Mark\u2019s only support network. Not anymore. Not if he wants to keep his family.", "Oh he's helping alright (giggity)", "Ok, I edited it to make myself sound less bitter. Thank you for pointing out my negative phrasing", "I agree it's over.

Mark is definitely there.", "No, that's how he got w the girl \ud83e\udd23", "I'm just saying that magically, there is an emergency popping up during all the holidays and celebrations. Gives off bastard child quality time vibes.", "I don't talk to that ex for a lot of reasons. I suspect that the father is still doing this and my ex is still the same. \n\nBesides the part where setting boundaries can be difficult with a parent, I think my ex liked how his father made my ex feel so important and like a genius. My ex didn't have parents who held him accountable when my ex messed up or wronged people who weren't the father- so that led to a lot of  issues with his professional and personal life where he had very few people in his life. Basically, it was always someone else's fault and my ex was a misunderstood genius and couldn't be blamed when he screwed up. This was exactly like his father.", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m thinking. The day he left the birth would\u2019ve been the day I\u2019d had said don\u2019t come back. Go be a couple with Mark. I\u2019ll see you in divorce court and don\u2019t even think of trying to get custody of the children.", "I think Mark and husband are still lovers. It's the story behind OPs post. It seemed crystal clear to me.", "Me too", "The MIL would know him since OP said he grew-up near her husband.", "If this isn't romantic, that may be what he wants.   Mark had a shitty family growing up and doesn't like that his BFF has a spouse and family now.", "It's not Mark that is the problem.  Hubby needs to examine his priorities.  If he would rather help Mark, then wife needs to decide if she will accept things as they  are, because Hubby knows it hurts her and does it anyway.  He's not going to change.", "Your edit still assumes that bi people are just greedy/need one of each. \n\nMaybe try again?", "Markilynn", "Misery loves company. You may be right but it seems far fetched. It seems like husband has been stuck in this dynamic for 30 years bailing mark out and is too nice to stop.", "seems like it, too.... I mean, one of the possibilities\n\nThe other can be that OP's husband just feels guilty and super responsible for Mark\n\nI need an update", "There's still a possibility that the real Mark is innocent and that husband has been using him as an excuse to leave.  Bit of a stretch, but life is stranger than fiction.", "Manipulating people come in many shapes sizes and orientations; doesn\u2019t say that with your blanket assumption.", "Owzat?", "well anal is hard to come by for some guys.", "I'm also leaning this way", "Better; still unsure why we're assuming sexuality here. I'd probably just leave it at \"there might be romantic feelings, there might not\"; I personally think it's an unhealthy relationship thing generally. \n\nI do appreciate you being game and open to change; that's really cool. Thank you for trying.", "But if there wasn't a sexual aspect, Mark would have no power to blackmail and manipulate. Unlikely that even the biggest man crush on the husbands part would facilitate him abandoning his family at Christmas. So that's what I'm getting at.", "Yeah, it's definitely weird. I wonder what's really up."]}
