He said multiple times that I could \u201ceat anything in the house.\u201d In a cabinet, I found a fancy looking box with bottle of hot sauce inside. I opened it and ate around 1/4 of the bottle. When he returned he was shocked that I opened the bottle and told me that he didn\u2019t want it opened. I reminded him that he said I could eat anything in the house and he said that obviously this unopened bottle was special and off-limits. He then told me he spent $150 on it and wanted me to buy him another one. I told him only an idiot would spend $150 on hot sauce and there is no way I would buy him another one when most of the bottle is still left. This has caused a major issue with my family and I need to fix this but I don\u2019t think I should have to buy a new bottle of this stuff.\n\nUpdate: I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to respond. Although a few people saw things from my perspective, it's pretty clear that I was an asshole for opening the bottle based on the way it looked I should have looked it up or asked him first. Many of you seem to think I did this on purpose which is not true. Keep in mind that I have never heard of luxury hot sauce and I never went to [Oliveum.com](https://oliveum.com/) to look it up. Obviously, the website makes it look very expensive but to me, although it looked fancier than normal hot sauce, never in a million years would I have guessed it would cost over $100.\n\nAnyway, I realize my error and I am going to reach out and apologize and try to make the situation right. I still don't want to pay $150 when 3/4 of the bottle is still there but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to make this right. I'll update you all later.", "created_utc": 1673137370, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1064ezf/aita_because_i_refuse_to_pay_for_luxury_hot_sauce/", "score": 109, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
