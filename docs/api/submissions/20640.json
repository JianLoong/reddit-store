He's unemployed and playing video games into the wee hours of the morning in his late 20s, that is certainly troubling. And you have asked him nicely over the course of a YEAR to not wake you up and he doesn't listen. I think asking him to sleep in the guest bedroom is a reasonable compromise, that he STILL wouldn't take. He kind of hasn't left you any other options beyond getting a lock.", "NTA You work he doesn't. He's being disrespectful and doesn't need to sleep in the room if so.", "NTA. I'm confuses by the YTA responses. She has to go to work early and is a light sleeper. He just lazies around all day playing video games and doesn't go to work. She can't control the fact that she's a light sleeper, he can control when he goes to bed.", "Normally I\u2019d say this is a nuclear reaction but if you have been communicating this problem to him for a year, and offered reasonable solutions like sleeping in the guest room if he decides to turn in that late then I\u2019m not sure you have many other options but to\nget a little petty for him to get the point. So I will say NTA though I\u2019m skeptical if this will be an effective solution long term or create other problems.\n\nDon\u2019t expect this to go right the first few nights though. You will almost certainly wake up to banging on the door and him shouting to let you in.", "NTA! You have made it clear that this is an issue and he is repeatedly disrespecting you. I think a lock is a marvelous idea.", "NTA. He needs to respect your boundaries and need for sleep. I think that the lock on the door is an excellent idea, especially if the guest bedroom already  available with an already made up bed. If he starts whining like a 12-year old, then perhaps you should evaluate if this is a life/situation/relationship you see yourself in down the road.", "NTA.  Yes, it is also his bedroom and without context it seems cruel, but it's not like he has no say for when he goes to bed.  It's not like he has a ridiculous work schedule keeping him up until the wee hours of the morning.  And it's also not like you're making him sleep on a couch or sleeping bag on the floor.  It's a whole ass bedroom, right?  If he can't get his unemployed gaming hours in check, you are absolutely not in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding your needs.", "INFO: Instead of locking him out, have you considered asking him to stay on the couch after a certain hour?\n\nI\u2019ve been in this position, where a partner deprived me of sleep because of his own dysfunctional sleep schedule and had no consideration for my own sleep. But in my situation that was one symptom of a much deeper lack of respect and toxic mindset. \n\nSo with that being said, INFO:\n\nAre there other times where he shows a disregard for your needs, prioritizes his own pleasure over your physical/mental health, or generally seems disrespectful?", "Ywbta but only to yourself because you need to handle this a better way and that\u2019s skirting the issue. You have a big problem with a lazy boy in a man\u2019s body you are supporting and enabling. He should be getting up at 5 too and getting himself together for a day of job hunting, not on a paid staycation. He has no self-discipline or self-respect, much less respect for you. Is he clinically depressed? He\u2019s definitely being very inconsiderate. Just go sleep in the guest room yourself if you want because everyone needs adequate sleep to function properly. I\u2019d be packing his bags (or mine), not locking a bedroom door.", "NTA - if you have a guest room i\u2019d suggest that should be his room for a while until he gets a job and can commit to a sleep schedule that doesn\u2019t impact your well-being. sleep deprivation is literally considered torture - your husband not being willing to make adjustments for you is completely disrespectful", "NTA. I hope he is actively looking for a job.", "Nta, he needs to start working and stop the person from working being sleep deprived.", "NTA lock the door. He can sleep in the guest bedroom if he wants to play vidyas till 2am.", "So what you do is at 5am...you wake him up", "INFO: when he comes to bed late does he do things to wake you up like turn on lights, make noise etc? And if not, have you tried things like earplugs or a sleep mask to keep you from being so easy to wake up?", "NTA\n\n> f me only he matters\n\nYes, that's exactly what I got from his behavior.", "Sleep in the guest room.  If you wake him up in the mornings when you come in to get your clothes etc, eh.  He obviously doesn't think being woken from sleep is a big deal.  Locking the door, however, feels to me like the wrong way to escalate this.\n\nNTA", "Is he actively looking for work?", "N T A\n\nBut there is definitely more info needed. You guys have been friends for 10 plus years if I understood you correctly. Which means you would know his quirks and short comings before you guys got married. Before you tied the knot, was this normal for him? Could he possibly be dealing with something that is undiagnosed himself. Not defending him, but I would hate to see you guys throw away a 10 plus years over something he may not be able to control. As somebody that grew up thinking they were broken, when I finally saw somebody and was given a diagnosis, so much of my life made so much more sense and why I had so many issues.\n\nWith that said, a lock may be a good solution for right now. It will suck the first couple of nights cause he will probably make a fuss, but he should get the hint. That coupled with communication might be enough. Good luck and I hope the best for you guys.", "YWBTA - but that's funny   \n\nSleep schedules, snoring, light sleeping--- these are all difficult to deal with. Why don't you sleep in the guest room? In fact, make that the most comfy sleeping room in the history of the world. Black out curtains, no lights, sound removal pads, and a realy nice alarm. That would be amazing!  \n\nI always find the idea of kicking someone out of the bedroom to be a weird relationship thing. As it tends to be kick the man out (sleep on the couch, figure it out, go somewhere else).  \n\nWhy not make the guest room the greatest sleeping room of all time!!  and keep the marriage bed for his lazy butt and for marriage activities.", "YTA. Unless he is coming into the bedroom and turning on lights or making some kind of racket, you're being unreasonable.  He doesn't have to go to bed on your schedule just because he married you, and 1-2am is pretty normal for a lot of adults (employed or not).\n\nIf he came to bed with you, is he not allowed to get up in the night for any purpose? To go to the bathroom, get a drink of water or an aspirin, anything?  \n\nIf your sleep demands are so rigid (**you mentioned in a comment it's simply him \"getting into bed\" that wakes you**), maybe separate bedrooms altogether are the solution.", "Info:\n\nIs last night the first time time you suggested he sleep in the guest bedroom if he's coming in after a certain time?\n\nHave you suggested a cut off for sleeping in the room he's failed to respect?\n\nHave you told him during the day that you're serious about that boundary, and it wasn't grumpy sleep talk?", "Yes, YWBTA is you did this. How about another solution?\n\nWhy not get a single bed and put it in your bedroom for your hubby. That way he can be in the room but not disturb you.\n\nAnother possible answer... I used to get the same from my wife- when I sat on the bed, her side bounces and she was woken up (i am not a small human). Our solution was a king bed that is actually two single mattresses on one bed frame. We also have separate bedding- she gets colder than I do and needs more blankets. Now her side of the bed doesn't move when I get in bed at night, and we can still enjoy being together.\n\nThis way, if you want to \"snuggle\", you have the option. If you want a bit of space, you have the option too!", "YWBTA - i get youre frustrated but this isnt the solution.", "YTA It may annoy you but it\u2019s his bedroom too and he is just as entitled to it as you. Putting a lock on the door like he is a child is petty, but not in a funny way, it\u2019s just weird. If it bothers you that much why can\u2019t you sleep in the guest room? You could adapt it to suit your precise sleeping needs.\nI do sympathise though, I\u2019m a light sleeper and get woken up all the time.\nI got a pair of sleep earbuds that really helped, when I play my white noise I can sleep through the night.", "YTA - by your own account he\u2019s not loud when he comes to bed, you wake up because the mattress moves when he gets in bed. That\u2019s a you problem, not a him problem.", "Sorry but YTA....he's got as much right to use the bed as you do... He may be on a different sleep schedule, but there's billions of people in the same situation....Myself included (my wife works till 2 am.... and I have to be up and out by 5) I'd never dream of telling her to sleep elsewhere.....", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I go to bed at 8/9 to accommodate being woken up at midnight, because it takes me an hour or two to fall back to sleep after 4 hrs of sleeping. Around midnight if I am woken up, I usually can fall back asleep to get 6-7 hrs of total sleep.\n\n>Have you told him during the day that you're serious about that boundary, and it wasn't grumpy sleep talk?\n\nYes, most conversation around this happens when I am heading up to bed or preparing to head to bed.", "We've discussed this but don't have the funds to do so, the cheapest option is for him to use the guest bedroom until a better resolution is in place.\n\nFor further clarification, my mattress needs to accommodate spinal issues and GERD, which our current mattress does (and was purchased pre-marriage by me)", "Normally I\u2019d agree but this has been going on for a year and more reasonable options were offered by OP but hubby has not used them, so I think it\u2019s fine in this instance", "What would be a reasonable solution?

And I often wake up overheating in the middle of the night and have to get up for a bit, so if I get up I sleep the rest of the night on the couch so I'm minimizing going in/out.

This isn\u2019t a man, he\u2019s a whole pile of red flags in a trench coat, and you deserve so much better than a disrespectful AH who refuses to consider your needs while actively freeloading off you when he should be looking for work.\n\nYou would absolutely be better off single at this point.", "NTA I'm shocked to hear that another woman who married an adult video game addict is upset that her marriage isn't working out.

Your husband is a AH.", "NTA.\n\nMy ex and I (amicably divorced) had this exact issue early in our marriage. I was the one coming to bed late, and it was solved by a frank discussion. She asked me to sleep on the couch if I was coming to bed after midnight as we didn't have a guest room, and I agreed. Done.  It's a way to enforce boundaries that will get buy-in from him (assuming he agrees) and force him to think about how disruptive his habits are. In my case it made me pay more attention to how late I was staying up, and after the boundary was set I did it a lot less often. \n\nIf you've suggested this to him and he gets petulant or doesn't follow through, then maybe a lock is the answer. Tell him the door will be locked after a given time, and if he wants to sleep in your (plural) bed, he needs to be there before that time.", "Hummmm, this not going to end well.", "NTA, i have the same\nissues and am a light sleeper. some people don\u2019t realise how disturbed sleep can impact them. Even if he\u2019s not doing it on purpose", "Ugh OP, I\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m going through something very similar with my husband. \n\nI have a full-time 9-to-5, a side gig freelancing and I teach exercise classes three times a week in the mornings - spin at 6:30 am. So I have to get up a little after 5. Last night my husband came into bed at 3:45 after playing video games and one of my earplugs had fallen out, so I woke up. I went to the bathroom and after, I could not for the life of me get back to sleep. I ended up with about five hours of sleep and went to my class delirious.\n\nMy husband has two mostly remote jobs with flexible hours but is a night owl. I am, too, honestly, and I wish I didn\u2019t have to go to bed so early but, alas, I do. I\u2019m also shouldering most of the financial burden as he settles into a new job that will soon be very lucrative. Meanwhile, I\u2019m really trying to keep up with my share of housework and other chores, (we have a pretty even split in this realm) but when this happens, I\u2019m completely shot and I feel worthless. I can\u2019t concentrate. Everything takes longer. I\u2019m quick to frustrate. I don\u2019t feel good about myself. \n\nWe\u2019ve talked about this so many times in so many ways over the last year or so, and admittedly it has gotten better. It used to be that he disturbed my sleep multiple times a week. He doesn\u2019t normally wake me these days but it\u2019s mostly because of the effort I\u2019ve put in. I wear earplugs and sometimes a face mask, and I take a sleep aid. (I\u2019ve upped that dosage recently, too.) To his credit, he has taken his electric toothbrush to our guest bathroom and really does try to be quiet coming in. But even if it happens sporadically, when it does happen, all I feel is resentment and anger. And exhaustion of course. \n\nHe \u201capologized\u201d this morning but blamed the bedroom door. I\u2019m just so tired of it. I\u2019ve tried explaining how I feel calmly. I\u2019ve written long notes that I\u2019ve shared with him. I\u2019ve raised my voice. I\u2019ve cried. I\u2019ve had him come to my class in an attempt to show him how difficult it is and why I need good sleep. Yet it happened again last night. \n\nI don\u2019t know the answer, and I\u2019m glued to these comments hoping to glean some insight. But I just want you to know I get it, and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through it, too.\n\nETA: NTA", "NTA\nSleep deprivation is a form of physical abuse. Ask him why he continues to cause your health and well being to be harmed. Needing your full night's sleep is a physical requirement for health. His reason for waking you up hours into your night's sleep can't diminish the fact that this behavior is harming you physically and mentally. Whatever reason he gives, it will be sacrificing your needs and physical well being for his convenience. You are not a snuggle toy for him to use at his whim.", "NTA.\n\nBut before you do this, I think you need to be very explicit with him.\n\nYou will not accept him waking you up between [bedtime] and 5am. You will tell him when you are going to sleep. If he decides to stay up later, he is sleeping on the guest bed or couch. Because he had been unable to respect this requirement, you are going to be locking the door. Does he understand?\n\nIf he bangs on the door, or tries to wake you between these hours, you\u2019re done. Because he\u2019s deliberately torturing you. I don\u2019t care if he doesn\u2019t mean it as maliciously as it ends up being. \n\nBecause so far you\u2019ve been crabby and he hugs you, you try to put it to him with \u201chow would you feel\u201d but have you said, \u201cI am fucking livid about this\u201d?", "I mean, if sleep is the real issue here, OP would just sleep in the guest bedroom.", "NTA", "Info:\n\nWhen.

It sucks but it means we both get a good sleep before work", "NTA.\n\nYour husband should understand your situation. Hope this gets sorted out soon.", "I mean this gently, but yes, you would be the asshole if you do that. I'm certainly not saying he's in the right, but locking your husband out of your shared bedroom is not a real solution to the problem. It's a way for you to get back at him for making you, justifiably, very irritated and sleep deprived, and playing the \"get even\" game with your spouse is never a good idea in a marriage, assuming that you actually want to stay married. \n\nYou said that last night you told him if he keeps it up, he needs to go sleep in the guest bedroom; follow up this evening with another talk where you reiterate that this is the case. Explain to him how much this is affecting you, how you feel not only tired, but like he doesn't listen to you, or change his behavior despite how much if hurts you, and that this isn't just about sleep, but about you needing to feel that he respects your reasonable wishes. Explain to him that him apologizing when he comes to bed late doesn't actually change the fact that he is willfully continuing to do something that he knows is bothering you, and that makes you feel like he isn't willing to make a small adjustment to his schedule for your benefit, and how frustrated you are that he continues to do this. When you go to bed, say \"I'm going to bed. Remember what we talked about, and if you don't want to come to bed by X time, I really need you to sleep in the guest bedroom. I love you, but I can't keep doing this. You waking me up in the middle of the night, every night, has been taking a toll on my happiness and health for too long, and it needs to stop, for both of our sake.\" Lay everything out in black and white, even if it's uncomfortable.\n\nHe is definitely the one who needs to change his behavior, but a padlock on the door is not the fix. The only thing that has a chance at fixing this is honest, open, clear communication. If that fails, then you have bigger issues, but there's no way that padlocking the bedroom door is going to improve your marriage. This is just my opinion, but a lot of people here have a boner for \"getting even\" style advice when it comes to relationships. It sounds great in theory, and scratches that petty itch to strike back at someone who upset you, but in practice it just further damages your relationship, and creates problems instead of solving them. This is your opportunity do draw a line in the sand, explain to him in painstaking detail how much this hurts you, and how badly you need it to stop, and then go from there. If he continues to do this after you made the most honest, open, mature appeal to him that you can, then you can at least rest assured that you tried your best to make him understand how you feel, and any future failings on his part, and their subsequent repercussions, will be solely his doing.", "NTA divorce this dude", "I agree.

You both NEED it.\n\nThe way he's behaving is not normal in a good marriage.  \"What about forever\" is fine, but you're not actually in a partnership right now.  HE is not acting as a partner.\n\nMaybe he is depressed by being unemployed. If so, understandable -- but then, he needs therapy himself. It's no an excuse for what he's been doing.\n\nWhat you're describing is not sustainable.  He's exhibiting absolutely NO care for you.  Like, he's your HUSBAND (and friend). He's SUPPOSED to care about whether you're getting so sleep deprived that you can't function.  He's supposed to want to do something to HELP you.

I know that aita tosses that term around a lot, but I really mean it.\n\nI realize that a post like this can't possibly answer all questions we might have.  For example: so he's unemployed at the moment.  How much of the housework is he doing, in order to lessen the burden for you, because you have to go to work?  Cooking? Cleaning? Laundry?  The economy is weird, so being unemployed for a bit isn't shameful (I assume he's LOOKING for a job).  But he should be showing some gratitude for the fact that YOU are keeping a paycheck coming into the house, and he should be showing you consideration for your needs related to that -- like a good night's sleep.\n\nIt's kind of alarming that he isn't.  (I would put $10 down right now that your answer will be that he doesn't really do chores.)  \n\nBut it's MORE alarming that this has been going on for a year, and he just won't listen, and won't try to help you.\n\nFrankly, what you're describing here is also alarming -- the tears may be real, but they ARE also manipulative.\n\nYou guys really need counseling.
