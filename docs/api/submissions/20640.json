I have spoken to him about this for almost a year now, everytime he does it I ask him if he knows the time, and without fail he apologizes and hugs me (admittedly I am very, very grumpy when Ilmy sleep is disturbed without reason.)\n\nLast night everything came to a head, he came in at ~1am and I told him \"I am not trying to control when he sleeps, I am just asking for basic respect. How would you feel if I started waking you up at ungodly hours in the morning before you have to go to work? If you're not going to come to bed at a reasonable time, then go sleep in our guest bedroom and stop disturbing my sleep.\"\n\nThis morning I had the thought of putting a lock on our bedroom door and locking it at night when I go to bed.

I do bear responsibility in coddling his feelings and emotions, so I know people will be more upset that I am taking the cowards way about things, I am just not mentally prepared to handle the fall out and have used this post as a way to vent my frustrations before I do and say something that would forever change our relationship.

I'm confuses by the YTA responses. She has to go to work early and is a light sleeper. He just lazies around all day playing video games and doesn't go to work. She can't control the fact that she's a light sleeper, he can control when he goes to bed.", "Normally I\u2019d say this is a nuclear reaction but if you have been communicating this problem to him for a year, and offered reasonable solutions like sleeping in the guest room if he decides to turn in that late then I\u2019m not sure you have many other options but to\nget a little petty for him to get the point. So I will say NTA though I\u2019m skeptical if this will be an effective solution long term or create other problems.\n\nDon\u2019t expect this to go right the first few nights though. You will almost certainly wake up to banging on the door and him shouting to let you in.", "NTA! You have made it clear that this is an issue and he is repeatedly disrespecting you. I think a lock is a marvelous idea.", "NTA. He needs to respect your boundaries and need for sleep. I think that the lock on the door is an excellent idea, especially if the guest bedroom already  available with an already made up bed. If he starts whining like a 12-year old, then perhaps you should evaluate if this is a life/situation/relationship you see yourself in down the road.", "NTA.  Yes, it is also his bedroom and without context it seems cruel, but it's not like he has no say for when he goes to bed.  It's not like he has a ridiculous work schedule keeping him up until the wee hours of the morning.  And it's also not like you're making him sleep on a couch or sleeping bag on the floor.  It's a whole ass bedroom, right?  If he can't get his unemployed gaming hours in check, you are absolutely not in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding your needs.", "INFO: Instead of locking him out, have you considered asking him to stay on the couch after a certain hour?\n\nI\u2019ve been in this position, where a partner deprived me of sleep because of his own dysfunctional sleep schedule and had no consideration for my own sleep.

You guys have been friends for 10 plus years if I understood you correctly. Which means you would know his quirks and short comings before you guys got married. Before you tied the knot, was this normal for him? Could he possibly be dealing with something that is undiagnosed himself. Not defending him, but I would hate to see you guys throw away a 10 plus years over something he may not be able to control. As somebody that grew up thinking they were broken, when I finally saw somebody and was given a diagnosis, so much of my life made so much more sense and why I had so many issues.\n\nWith that said, a lock may be a good solution for right now. It will suck the first couple of nights cause he will probably make a fuss, but he should get the hint. That coupled with communication might be enough. Good luck and I hope the best for you guys.", "YWBTA - but that's funny   \n\nSleep schedules, snoring, light sleeping--- these are all difficult to deal with. Why don't you sleep in the guest room? In fact, make that the most comfy sleeping room in the history of the world. Black out curtains, no lights, sound removal pads, and a realy nice alarm. That would be amazing!  \n\nI always find the idea of kicking someone out of the bedroom to be a weird relationship thing. As it tends to be kick the man out (sleep on the couch, figure it out, go somewhere else).  \n\nWhy not make the guest room the greatest sleeping room of all time!!  and keep the marriage bed for his lazy butt and for marriage activities.", "YTA. Unless he is coming into the bedroom and turning on lights or making some kind of racket, you're being unreasonable.  He doesn't have to go to bed on your schedule just because he married you, and 1-2am is pretty normal for a lot of adults (employed or not).\n\nIf he came to bed with you, is he not allowed to get up in the night for any purpose? To go to the bathroom, get a drink of water or an aspirin, anything?  \n\nIf your sleep demands are so rigid (**you mentioned in a comment it's simply him \"getting into bed\" that wakes you**), maybe separate bedrooms altogether are the solution.", "Info:\n\nIs last night the first time time you suggested he sleep in the guest bedroom if he's coming in after a certain time?\n\nHave you suggested a cut off for sleeping in the room he's failed to respect?\n\nHave you told him during the day that you're serious about that boundary, and it wasn't grumpy sleep talk?", "Yes, YWBTA is you did this. How about another solution?\n\nWhy not get a single bed and put it in your bedroom for your hubby. That way he can be in the room but not disturb you.\n\nAnother possible answer... I used to get the same from my wife- when I sat on the bed, her side bounces and she was woken up (i am not a small human). Our solution was a king bed that is actually two single mattresses on one bed frame. We also have separate bedding- she gets colder than I do and needs more blankets. Now her side of the bed doesn't move when I get in bed at night, and we can still enjoy being together.\n\nThis way, if you want to \"snuggle\", you have the option. If you want a bit of space, you have the option too!", "[deleted]", "YTA It may annoy you but it\u2019s his bedroom too and he is just as entitled to it as you. Putting a lock on the door like he is a child is petty, but not in a funny way, it\u2019s just weird. If it bothers you that much why can\u2019t you sleep in the guest room? You could adapt it to suit your precise sleeping needs.\nI do sympathise though, I\u2019m a light sleeper and get woken up all the time.\nI got a pair of sleep earbuds that really helped, when I play my white noise I can sleep through the night.", "YTA - by your own account he\u2019s not loud when he comes to bed, you wake up because the mattress moves when he gets in bed. That\u2019s a you problem, not a him problem.", "Sorry but YTA....he's got as much right to use the bed as you do...

So I have to get up a little after 5. Last night my husband came into bed at 3:45 after playing video games and one of my earplugs had fallen out, so I woke up. I went to the bathroom and after, I could not for the life of me get back to sleep. I ended up with about five hours of sleep and went to my class delirious.\n\nMy husband has two mostly remote jobs with flexible hours but is a night owl. I am, too, honestly, and I wish I didn\u2019t have to go to bed so early but, alas, I do.

I don\u2019t feel good about myself. \n\nWe\u2019ve talked about this so many times in so many ways over the last year or so, and admittedly it has gotten better. It used to be that he disturbed my sleep multiple times a week. He doesn\u2019t normally wake me these days but it\u2019s mostly because of the effort I\u2019ve put in. I wear earplugs and sometimes a face mask, and I take a sleep aid. (I\u2019ve upped that dosage recently, too.) To his credit, he has taken his electric toothbrush to our guest bathroom and really does try to be quiet coming in.

I\u2019ve had him come to my class in an attempt to show him how difficult it is and why I need good sleep.

Explain to him how much this is affecting you, how you feel not only tired, but like he doesn't listen to you, or change his behavior despite how much if hurts you, and that this isn't just about sleep, but about you needing to feel that he respects your reasonable wishes. Explain to him that him apologizing when he comes to bed late doesn't actually change the fact that he is willfully continuing to do something that he knows is bothering you, and that makes you feel like he isn't willing to make a small adjustment to his schedule for your benefit, and how frustrated you are that he continues to do this.

The only thing that has a chance at fixing this is honest, open, clear communication.

This is just my opinion, but a lot of people here have a boner for \"getting even\" style advice when it comes to relationships. It sounds great in theory, and scratches that petty itch to strike back at someone who upset you, but in practice it just further damages your relationship, and creates problems instead of solving them. This is your opportunity do draw a line in the sand, explain to him in painstaking detail how much this hurts you, and how badly you need it to stop, and then go from there.

You know he won't pick up the slack financially or around the house and now on top of everything you have to take care of he's depriving you of sleep.

I try to be fully asleep before he comes in between 11pm-12am. He snores. When he drinks alcohol he snores even worse. If he is congested (allergies or drinking) he automatically sleeps in the guest room. \n\nYour husband needs to have someone kick him in the ass.

It's honestly wild to me when couples try to force co-sleeping when they're not sleep compatible, like I get wanting to feel close in that way but also you're unconscious for 90% of the time your in bed, so why stay tired and miserable forcing a situation that doesn't work, you know?", "I understand that series of steps. I guess what i just cant relate to is having a dedicated conversation, explaining the importance, stating the problem, stating a solution (the spare bedroom), and then being ignored.
