I have spoken to him about this for almost a year now, everytime he does it I ask him if he knows the time, and without fail he apologizes and hugs me (admittedly I am very, very grumpy when Ilmy sleep is disturbed without reason.)\n\nLast night everything came to a head, he came in at ~1am and I told him \"I am not trying to control when he sleeps, I am just asking for basic respect. How would you feel if I started waking you up at ungodly hours in the morning before you have to go to work? If you're not going to come to bed at a reasonable time, then go sleep in our guest bedroom and stop disturbing my sleep.\"\n\nThis morning I had the thought of putting a lock on our bedroom door and locking it at night when I go to bed.

He's unemployed and playing video games into the wee hours of the morning in his late 20s, that is certainly troubling. And you have asked him nicely over the course of a YEAR to not wake you up and he doesn't listen. I think asking him to sleep in the guest bedroom is a reasonable compromise, that he STILL wouldn't take. He kind of hasn't left you any other options beyond getting a lock.", "NTA You work he doesn't. He's being disrespectful and doesn't need to sleep in the room if so.", "NTA. I'm confuses by the YTA responses. She has to go to work early and is a light sleeper. He just lazies around all day playing video games and doesn't go to work. She can't control the fact that she's a light sleeper, he can control when he goes to bed.", "Normally I\u2019d say this is a nuclear reaction but if you have been communicating this problem to him for a year, and offered reasonable solutions like sleeping in the guest room if he decides to turn in that late then I\u2019m not sure you have many other options but to\nget a little petty for him to get the point. So I will say NTA though I\u2019m skeptical if this will be an effective solution long term or create other problems.\n\nDon\u2019t expect this to go right the first few nights though. You will almost certainly wake up to banging on the door and him shouting to let you in.", "NTA! You have made it clear that this is an issue and he is repeatedly disrespecting you. I think a lock is a marvelous idea.", "NTA. He needs to respect your boundaries and need for sleep. I think that the lock on the door is an excellent idea, especially if the guest bedroom already  available with an already made up bed. If he starts whining like a 12-year old, then perhaps you should evaluate if this is a life/situation/relationship you see yourself in down the road.", "NTA.  Yes, it is also his bedroom and without context it seems cruel, but it's not like he has no say for when he goes to bed.  It's not like he has a ridiculous work schedule keeping him up until the wee hours of the morning.  And it's also not like you're making him sleep on a couch or sleeping bag on the floor.  It's a whole ass bedroom, right?  If he can't get his unemployed gaming hours in check, you are absolutely not in the wrong for setting boundaries regarding your needs.", "INFO: Instead of locking him out, have you considered asking him to stay on the couch after a certain hour?\n\nI\u2019ve been in this position, where a partner deprived me of sleep because of his own dysfunctional sleep schedule and had no consideration for my own sleep. But in my situation that was one symptom of a much deeper lack of respect and toxic mindset. \n\nSo with that being said, INFO:\n\nAre there other times where he shows a disregard for your needs, prioritizes his own pleasure over your physical/mental health, or generally seems disrespectful?", "Ywbta but only to yourself because you need to handle this is a better way and that\u2019s skirting the issue. You have a big problem with a lazy boy in a man\u2019s body you are supporting and enabling. He should be getting up at 5 too and getting himself together for a day of job hunting, not on a paid staycation. He has no self-discipline of self-respect, much less respect for you. Is he clinically depressed? He\u2019s definitely being very inconsiderate. Just go sleep in the guest room yourself if you want because everyone needs adequate sleep to function properly. I\u2019d be packing his bags (or mine), not locking a bedroom door.", "NTA - if you have a guest room i\u2019d suggest that should be his room for a while until he gets a job and can commit to a sleep schedule that doesn\u2019t impact your well-being. sleep deprivation is literally considered torture - your husband not being willing to make adjustments for you is completely disrespectful", "NTA. I hope he is actively looking for a job.", "Nta, he needs to start working and stop the person from working being sleep deprived.", "NTA lock the door. He can sleep in the guest bedroom if he wants to play vidyas till 2am.", "So what you do is at 5am...you wake him up", "INFO: when he comes to bed late does he do things to wake you up like turn on lights, make noise etc? And if not, have you tried things like earplugs or a sleep mask to keep you from being so easy to wake up?", "NTA\n\n> f me only he matters\n\nYes, that's exactly what I got from his behavior.", "Sleep in the guest room.  If you wake him up in the mornings when you come in to get your clothes etc, eh.  He obviously doesn't think being woken from sleep is a big deal.  Locking the door, however, feels to me like the wrong way to escalate this.\n\nNTA", "Is he actively looking for work?", "N T A\n\nBut there is definitely more info needed. You guys have been friends for 10 plus years if I understood you correctly. Which means you would know his quirks and short comings before you guys got married. Before you tied the knot, was this normal for him? Could he possibly be dealing with something that is undiagnosed himself. Not defending him, but I would hate to see you guys throw away a 10 plus years over something he may not be able to control. As somebody that grew up thinking they were broken, when I finally saw somebody and was given a diagnosis, so much of my life made so much more sense and why I had so many issues.\n\nWith that said, a lock may be a good solution for right now. It will suck the first couple of nights cause he will probably make a fuss, but he should get the hint. That coupled with communication might be enough. Good luck and I hope the best for you guys.", "YWBTA - but that's funny   \n\nSleep schedules, snoring, light sleeping--- these are all difficult to deal with. Why don't you sleep in the guest room? In fact, make that the most comfy sleeping room in the history of the world. Black out curtains, no lights, sound removal pads, and a realy nice alarm. That would be amazing!  \n\nI always find the idea of kicking someone out of the bedroom to be a weird relationship thing. As it tends to be kick the man out (sleep on the couch, figure it out, go somewhere else).  \n\nWhy not make the guest room the greatest sleeping room of all time!!  and keep the marriage bed for his lazy butt and for marriage activities.", "YTA. Unless he is coming into the bedroom and turning on lights or making some kind of racket, you're being unreasonable.  He doesn't have to go to bed on your schedule just because he married you, and 1-2am is pretty normal for a lot of adults (employed or not).\n\nIf he came to bed with you, is he not allowed to get up in the night for any purpose? To go to the bathroom, get a drink of water or an aspirin, anything?  \n\nIf your sleep demands are so rigid (you mentioned in a comment it's simply him \"getting into bed\" that wakes you), maybe separate bedrooms altogether are the solution.", "Info:\n\nIs last night the first time time you suggested he sleep in the guest bedroom if he's coming in after a certain time?\n\nHave you suggested a cut off for sleeping in the room he's failed to respect?\n\nHave you told him during the day that you're serious about that boundary, and it wasn't grumpy sleep talk?", "Yes, YWBTA is you did this. How about another solution?\n\nWhy not get a single bed and put it in your bedroom for your hubby. That way he can be in the room but not disturb you.\n\nAnother possible answer... I used to get the same from my wife- when I sat on the bed, her side bounces and she was woken up (i am not a small human). Our solution was a king bed that is actually two single mattresses on one bed frame. We also have separate bedding- she gets colder than I do and needs more blankets. Now her side of the bed doesn't move when I get in bed at night, and we can still enjoy being together.\n\nThis way, if you want to \"snuggle\", you have the option. If you want a bit of space, you have the option too!", "YWBTA - i get youre frustrated but this isnt the solution.", "YTA It may annoy you but it\u2019s his bedroom too and he is just as entitled to it as you. Putting a lock on the door like he is a child is petty, but not in a funny way, it\u2019s just weird. If it bothers you that much why can\u2019t you sleep in the guest room? You could adapt it to suit your precise sleeping needs.\nI do sympathise though, I\u2019m a light sleeper and get woken up all the time.\nI got a pair of sleep earbuds that really helped, when I play my white noise I can sleep through the night.", "YTA - by your own account he\u2019s not loud when he comes to bed, you wake up because the mattress moves when he gets in bed. That\u2019s a you problem, not a him problem.", "Sorry but YTA....he's got as much right to use the bed as you do... He may be on a different sleep schedule, but there's billions of people in the same situation....Myself included (my wife works till 2 am.... and I have to be up and out by 5) I'd never dream of telling her to sleep elsewhere.....", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He wasn't particularly happy about the suggestion which is understandable I love the idea of sleeping in the same bed with my husband l, but at this point it's an ideal and not realistic if we can't come to a compromise.\n\n>Have you suggested a cut off for sleeping in the room he's failed to respect?\n\nYes, it's midnight. I go to bed at 8/9 to accommodate being woken up at midnight, because it takes me an hour or two to fall back to sleep after 4 hrs of sleeping. Around midnight if I am woken up, I usually can fall back asleep to get 6-7 hrs of total sleep.\n\n>Have you told him during the day that you're serious about that boundary, and it wasn't grumpy sleep talk?\n\nYes, most conversation around this happens when I am heading up to bed or preparing to head to bed.", "We've discussed this but don't have the funds to do so, the cheapest option is for him to use the guest bedroom until a better resolution is in place.\n\nFor further clarification, my mattress needs to accommodate spinal issues and GERD, which our current mattress does (and was purchased pre-marriage by me)", "Normally I\u2019d agree but this has been going on for a year and more reasonable options were offered by OP but hubby has not used them, so I think it\u2019s fine in this instance", "What would be a reasonable solution?

We don't have a guest room, but if my partner is going to sleep after a certain time on my working days, they sleep on the couch so they don't wake me close to when I have to get up (I can't fall back asleep if I'm woken less than 3 hours before I have to get up). And I often wake up overheating in the middle of the night and have to get up for a bit, so if I get up I sleep the rest of the night on the couch so I'm minimizing going in/out.

Then thats on you - but you need to communicate.

There\u2019s also a lot more info needed here to really asses solutions - like *how* is he waking her up? Is he doing something unreasonable or just simply getting into bed? \n\nShe seems very judgmental of his sleep schedule, hobbies, etc - whats going on there? When does he have to get up, etc. \n\nBut overall - locking your spouse out of your shared bedroom is immature and will not actually help the problem, only exacerbate.", "In no way is it fair for you to refuse him access to his room.

Hobbies? No, I am a gamer and the only time he willingly bonds with me is through video games (edit: it's also how we met 10yrs ago). Do I have harboring resentment towards him? Yes, I have been working on it and even suggested a marriage counselor a year ago, idk why he married me and I know my own mental and physical health problems are making things worse.
