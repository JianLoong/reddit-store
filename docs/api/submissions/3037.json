NTA  your sister is being ridiculous", "NTA \n\nSo as Julie in your previous hiking adventure was less than impressed by the experience talk again with Eva and Anne. \n\nFirst confirm they are not making changes to what was already planned -  considerable outdoor time with a lot of physical exercise. If they are going to change the vacation to leisurely 20 minutes strolls to breakfast, lunch and dinner to accommodate Julie\u2019s pregnancy then you can tell them again you will take a pass as the vacation they are now planning is not what you agreed to. \n\nIf they are still expecting no changes to the vacation then IMO you should go. But I would make it clear you will not be sitting somewhere keeping Julie company rather than hiking and/or biking. \n\nI do question if Julie or anyone else who is not currently going on regular long walks and long bike rides being up for it when they are 7 months along. As a matter of fact before Julie puts money into this vacation she would be well served to discuss it with her OBGYN and get their blessing.  \n\nThe last thing you want is anything to happen to Julie by her trying to push on thru then hurting herself or potentially the baby. \n\nYour time and money so of course do what makes sense to you for your vacation.", "NTA.

(Likely said already in other ways)\n\nAt 7 months pregnant, going camping(even if in a cabin or RV) means being hella far from and proper medical care if an emergency pops up. Even just walking around the area for the cabin/RV, will have uneven terrain, so if she falls, there is high risk of hurting herself and the baby. And if for some reason, her body decides to go into premature labor, same issues. Hours waiting for ambulance(of any kind), and the extra time to reach a hospital. \n\nShe will not have the normal comforts she\u2019s used to, so she is likely going to be miserable.

Maybe you all can take a long weekend trip someplace less strenuous and go on your planned week long vacation without her.", "As an avid outdoors and athletic person having a 7-month-old pregnant woman go with me on hiking and biking does not sound like a good idea, especially since the woman in question has no experience doing any of those activities. You said that you've taken her in the past and she hasn't been receptive of your activities and now that she is going to be extremely pregnant, it'll be dangerous for her.
