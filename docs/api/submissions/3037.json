And yeah people will probably feel sorry for her and bail out of activities to keep her company when she can\u2019t do it. Plus you said she\u2019s not even outdoorsy anyway. Explain to her what the activities will be and say ofc I\u2019d love to spend time with you but this is what we will be doing and it\u2019s going to hinder our vacation plans so why don\u2019t we arrange something for us to do aside from the vacation.", "I can understand her wanting to be included and wanting to go on vacation before baby arrives, but I\u2019m not sure this is the right vacation for her.

Perhaps Stepmom & Stepsis can ask her to go on a spa weekend or something she might enjoy more.\n\nAnd its also fair that you would want to proceed with your camping / hiking trip with all the activities originally scheduled.  Having someone there who doesnt enjoy any of those things would certainly change the trip vibe.\n\nGiven that sister cant do anything to change the timing of her pregancy/birth, maybe offer to reschedule the camping trip and let them use the timeslot to plan a last pre-baby trip with sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Asking because you sound a little delusional.", "Why do you Redditors always jump to these inane conclusions, hiking is a bit different than going to the mall or taking a shower?! If you feel I am wrong, you could just say that its not as bad as I think, not playing hoops with me and making these wild jumps.", "Except if she trips at a mall, there will be dozens if people able to call for a paramedic.\n  \nIf she slips in the shower, she will probably be able to scream for help and someone will hear her.\n  \nAnd in both of those scenarios, there is likely a hospital or UC or her OB/GYN within a half hour of wherever she is. Likely less. \n  \nAnd your argument that \"if it's not dangerous for the average person then it's not dangerous for a pregnant woman\" is only half true.\n  \nIf she had been a camper and hiker *BEFORE* she was pregnant and could do all those things and had no trouble hiking and mountain biking, then it would be perfectly safe. \n  \nYou're not recommended to start a new form of exercise while pregnant. However if you were an avid runner before pregnancy, your doctor or NP will tell you, \"No worries! Just listen to your body and take care of yourself.\"\n  \nWhen you try a new sport or form of exercise it is very easy to overdo it the first time and pull something or go to the point of exhaustion. Some people have trouble knowing when they are approaching their limits and when to stop. \n  \nWhen you are *pregnant*, your normal limitations change and you tun the risk of passing out or getting dizzy or getting a muscle cramp. You need to know your limits BEFORE being pregnant so that you can have an idea of where your limits are WHILE pregnant.", "Hiking puts you in more remote areas where help is not easily accessible.  You'd get help immediately in a mall.  Seriously.", "Are you ok? Is there a reason you jumped to insulting and belittling me?", "I mean if she was a woman who enjoyed hiking and the outdoors, it might be okay, especially if it wasn't a rocky trail they were hiking. But if you don't like hiking or the outdoors, a camping trip seems like an absolutely horrible idea especially 7 months pregnant.", "Julie doesn't like hiking!", "How is asking a legitimate question insulting and belittling to you? I really want to know if you have interaction with people IRL.", "Again you are being aggressive and condescending for no reason."]}
