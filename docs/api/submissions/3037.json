I think this line sums it all up:\n\n> nd that since she's pregnant I should be more supportive towards her going on vacation.\n\nYour concerns were 100% warranted, because this is absolutely what she's going to do.", "NTA - I frankly can't believe someone who is going to be 7 months pregnant would want to go camping and hiking. It's going to be an absolutely miserable experience for everyone.\n\nNot to mention her statement to you that because she's pregnant you should be more accommodating is the most obvious foreshadowing I've ever seen into what she's going to be like on this trip.\n\nI'd say go on the trip, have fun, and do your own thing. The people who decided she should come can deal with the problems they've invited.", "NTA. Why does she even want to go on this vacation if she doesn't like exercise or being outdoors, plus being pregnant? Sounds like a recipe for a shitty time.", "NTA honestly let the three of them go so that they will realise why you pulled out. Dont be emotional, just say it was three anyway and if you drop  out and she goes its also 3. Wish them a great time and thats it. They are the ones who will have a nightmare time with her.", "NTA.  Nope, you can\u2019t stop her from going on *her own* vacation to this place at the same time as you.  But she can\u2019t force *you* to include her in your plans just because she wants to go.  And if everyone else would rather totally change what this trip was supposed to be so they *can* include her - which *is* how this is ultimately going to shake out if she comes - you\u2019re within your rights to bow out so you can make sure you still get to do what you want to do.", "NTA\n\n\nIt already sucks to be around a non-outdoorsy person on a camping/hiking trip, adding the fact that she is 7 months pregnant on top of that would just guarantee the trip will suck. (And to be honest, even if she loved hiking and camping, being 7 months pregnant would probably ruin most of the trip anyways).", "I really don't think a 7 month's pregnant woman should be out in the woods. Anything can happen especially if it's her first. \n\nTell her you just don't think it's safe but you're more than happy to have her along for a baby free weekend after the baby comes.", "NTA. She\u2019s TA for wanting to come and ruin everyone\u2019s vacation because she will most likely not be able to do a lot of those things or at least not do them for very long being 7 months pregnant. Not even sure why she wants to go tbh isn\u2019t that kinda dangerous for a heavily pregnant woman? And yeah people will probably feel sorry for her and bail out of activities to keep her company when she can\u2019t do it. Plus you said she\u2019s not even outdoorsy anyway. Explain to her what the activities will be and say ofc I\u2019d love to spend time with you but this is what we will be doing and it\u2019s going to hinder our vacation plans so why don\u2019t we arrange something for us to do aside from the vacation.", "I can understand her wanting to be included and wanting to go on vacation before baby arrives, but I\u2019m not sure this is the right vacation for her. Is it possible to have another small vacation that she can be included in that you would all enjoy? (If it\u2019s affordable for you all, if course.)", "OR just plan another trip with someone else and tell them the day you were supposed to go that your going somewhere else", "NTA\n\nShe can go on her own vacation if she wants to go on one but more than likely, she's going to try to convince your stepmom and stepsister to go on vacation with her.", "NTA, I love camping but HATE sleeping when camping. I now have a cot and it still sucks. I can't imagine how awful it'd be being 7 months pregnant. She's not being realistic probably because she's in a stage of her pregnancy where she's feeling good. I can almost guarantee she'll want to go home or to a hotel after one night.", "NTA tell Julie to go take a hike\n\nYou\u2019re not saying the rest of them can\u2019t vacation together.", "Let her come. JUst let her know you will not cater to her and she has to take care of herself.\n\nALso tell her if she gets hurt she will have to find her own way out because \"Told ya\"", "I like camping but 7 months pregnant, hell no! You can\u2019t get a good nights sleep in an expensive mattress in the third trimester, trying to sleep while camping would be horrible. NTA. Hope step Mom and step sis enjoy to complaint fest and the eventual move to a motel. NTA", "NTA. I\u2019ve been 7 months pregnant. Camping while that far along is an incredibly stupid idea.", "Why would a non-exercise pregnant woman want to attend a hiking/mt-bike vacation? She will 100% want accommodations and to change the agenda. \n\nNTA", "NAH.  This is your sister's last vacation without a baby.  Let her know that there will be some activities she won't be able to do because she is so pregnant.  I would include her on the vacation, but exclude her for the more dangerous activities.  At least one a day.  Go for a short easy walk with her.  Then say, see you later and do the real hike.  It sounds like you don't like her much.  There are other people that do, let them cater to her.  I don't see a way out of including her if you want to go at all.", "NTA. Pregnant or not your concerns are valid. I think your best course of action is to just talk to Julie and explain to her your plans, even if you\u2019ve already done that I\u2019d do it again. If she still insists on going and the other two are on board then maybe they can take their own trip. \n\nI don\u2019t know much about pregnancy so I can\u2019t really weigh in on that, but common sense makes me think 7 months pregnant and the kinds of hikes an experienced hiker would be planning to take won\u2019t mix well. But again, I know nothing on this subject so it\u2019s purely speculation.", "NAH\n\nI can see sister wanting to take a last hurrah vacation before the baby is born, but a camping / hiking trip that is not really her favorite way to spend time is not really the best option.  Perhaps Stepmom & Stepsis can ask her to go on a spa weekend or something she might enjoy more.\n\nAnd its also fair that you would want to proceed with your camping / hiking trip with all the activities originally scheduled.  Having someone there who doesnt enjoy any of those things would certainly change the trip vibe.\n\nGiven that sister cant do anything to change the timing of her pregancy/birth, maybe offer to reschedule the camping trip and let them use the timeslot to plan a last pre-baby trip with sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You could propose a different activity with your sister such as going to a spa where she could get a prenatal massage or other treatments. I did that with my daughter when she was pregnant and it was a great trip. We just went for the weekend, and drove there, so it wasn\u2019t that expensive. However it doesn\u2019t make sense for her to go camping and hiking while heavily pregnant and might not be safe. What if she fell and hurt herself or had some pregnancy issue that needed medical care while in the woods? I think you should just explain that you wouldn\u2019t be comfortable going on this particular trip with her due to the stenuous activities and lack of rapid access to medical care, but would love to do something more appropriate with her on a different occasion.\nEdit:typo", "NTA the truth is a good defence.

I have to pick up my son from school on foot half the week (2 miles total) and that\u2019s more than enough. I\u2019m exhausted thinking about it. I don\u2019t even mind camping and hiking but I would not do it whilst pregnant. I\u2019m too tired for that. I basically just want to rest all the time.", "Nta. It's not about the pregnancy, it's about the attitude. Pregnant or not hers suck. Let them go and deal with her. Maybe you should go camping elsewhere with your friends instead", "NTA.

I get why you don't want her to go and why you don't want her to go. \n\nI also get why the others don't want to deny this to another family member who has asked to go. \n\nUnfortunately its a situation where no one will be happy", "NAH\n\nHonestly, if you have any interest at all in going on vacation with your sister, even if THIS vacation you have in mind would not be the right thing, I would consider changing your plans to something you can do together. She\u2019s pregnant this time\u2026 but that means next time she\u2019ll have a baby to haul around and that makes a huge change in her life and how it would be to travel with her. It changes your vacations quite a lot!
