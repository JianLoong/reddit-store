And yeah people will probably feel sorry for her and bail out of activities to keep her company when she can\u2019t do it. Plus you said she\u2019s not even outdoorsy anyway. Explain to her what the activities will be and say ofc I\u2019d love to spend time with you but this is what we will be doing and it\u2019s going to hinder our vacation plans so why don\u2019t we arrange something for us to do aside from the vacation.", "I can understand her wanting to be included and wanting to go on vacation before baby arrives, but I\u2019m not sure this is the right vacation for her.

Perhaps Stepmom & Stepsis can ask her to go on a spa weekend or something she might enjoy more.\n\nAnd its also fair that you would want to proceed with your camping / hiking trip with all the activities originally scheduled.  Having someone there who doesnt enjoy any of those things would certainly change the trip vibe.\n\nGiven that sister cant do anything to change the timing of her pregancy/birth, maybe offer to reschedule the camping trip and let them use the timeslot to plan a last pre-baby trip with sister.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019ve been on both sides of the of the hiking dilemma. I\u2019ve been the out of shape and/or slower hiker.\n\nWe always make whoever invites someone we know can\u2019t keep up stay with them while we go ahead. We\u2019ve found that to be the best way to avoid fights.", "Someone who isn\u2019t outdoorsy and doesn\u2019t regularly hike probably shouldn\u2019t go when they\u2019re 7 months pregnant. I believe you\u2019re correct in expecting complaints and having to accommodate her. I wouldn\u2019t go either. \n\nNTA.", "LOL let her come. At 7 months prego, all I wanted to do was stand naked in the old section at the grocery store. She will regret coming.", "At 7 months I could barely walk, never mind hike! And I was just 2 years older than Julie. What if she falls? Gets taken ill? Goes into premature labour? NTA  your sister is being ridiculous", "NTA \n\nSo as Julie in your previous hiking adventure was less than impressed by the experience talk again with Eva and Anne. \n\nFirst confirm they are not making changes to what was already planned -  considerable outdoor time with a lot of physical exercise. If they are going to change the vacation to leisurely 20 minutes strolls to breakfast, lunch and dinner to accommodate Julie\u2019s pregnancy then you can tell them again you will take a pass as the vacation they are now planning is not what you agreed to. \n\nIf they are still expecting no changes to the vacation then IMO you should go. But I would make it clear you will not be sitting somewhere keeping Julie company rather than hiking and/or biking. \n\nI do question if Julie or anyone else who is not currently going on regular long walks and long bike rides being up for it when they are 7 months along. As a matter of fact before Julie puts money into this vacation she would be well served to discuss it with her OBGYN and get their blessing.  \n\nThe last thing you want is anything to happen to Julie by her trying to push on thru then hurting herself or potentially the baby. \n\nYour time and money so of course do what makes sense to you for your vacation.", "NTA. If I were you, I\u2019d just tell her calmly and honestly that the last time she went hiking with you she complained the whole time. Ask her why she wants to go if she doesn\u2019t like it, and if she really thinks she\u2019ll have a good time doing something she doesn\u2019t enjoy while 7 months pregnant.\n\nJust let the three of them go together and the other two can put up with her.", "Was just about to say that she's ALREADY playing the pregnant card about the vacation.  It will 100% be played over and over whenever she doesn't want to do something.  Or, when she wants to do something like... I don't know... you all need to drive into town because the pregnant lady wants ice cream.", "Ahh the parent trap camping trip strategy!", "If you have a healthy pregnancy it\u2019s totally safe to go hiking. I hiked, kayaked, and camped all the way up to 40 weeks pregnant because that\u2019s just my normal lifestyle and pregnancy didn\u2019t stop me from doing my hobbies. The reason SIL shouldn\u2019t  go is because she doesn\u2019t even like camping or outdoorsy stuff.", "I was going to say exactly this!", "Why should everyone have to reschedule an already planned trip to accommodate her? If anything, Julie needs to plan a vacation after the fact that she can enjoy and invite others to join her. Just because she\u2019s pregnant does not mean that everyone must hold off on their plans for her.", "This is my question too. There should be a group meeting where they discuss all possibilities:\n\n- What is Julie planning to actually do? \n\n- If a hike is too much for her, is she fine with walking back to the campsite by herself? Is she fine with staying at the campsite by herself in general? \n\n- Are the stepmom and other sisters ok with leaving Julie by herself at the campsite? \n\n- Where is the nearest hospital with a maternity ward in case something does happen?", "Why not try to save her trip and make her sister happy at the same time?", "The thing is she didn't see it as a hiking holiday she just saw it as a holiday", "WHY?", "See I was still going on 10 mile hikes and canoe trips at 9 months pregnant. In this case she hates hiking and outdoor stuff in general, but a lot of women can camp, hike, and kayak up until they give birth.", "How about this, why would it even be safe, if she slips and falls, she could lose the baby,", "There's also a chance that she doesn't even really want to go on a hiking trip, she just wants to feel close to her family because she's about to become a mom. \n\nIt might be the last time she ever gets to take a trip that's just them. \n\nI know that's dramatic but things tend to feel that way when you coming up on a clear before/after moment.", "lol  I didn't mind pregnancy that much.  I was fairly active.With my last, I was running a couple of times per week up until the third trimester, and biking my older 2 to summer day camp every day, while pulling the 3yo in a bike trailer, up until I was 39 weeks and my balance was thrown off.  But sleeping in a tent and having to walk a distance to pee (esp in the middle of the night!), all while carrying a bowling ball in my abdomen?  Just no."]}
