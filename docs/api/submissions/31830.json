Her attitude around your child is strange, at best, and it looks like that Claire has something to unpack with a professional therapist.\n\nFrankly, I'd be quite uncomfortable too, leaving my daugther with a woman who seems slightly obsessed with her.", "NTA. Claire wants to spend time doing parental activities with a child who doesn't have any special needs. It's not \"babysitting\" as such - it's substitution as she's unable to do them with her own daughter.\n\nI have a great deal of sympathy for her. She's watching everyone else get the Kodak moments that we all picture before becoming parents, yet they're denied to her with her own child.\n\nHowever, you are in no way required to help her get those moments at your own cost - not to mention you would be enabling her to exclude her own child in favour of yours.\n\nIt's a tough situation for Claire, but ultimately one she has to deal with herself - and not by doing this. I could see her getting possessive of your daughter as well, so you are doing the right thing by nipping it in the bud straight away.", "NTA\n\nI know some people may downvote this, as we can all empathize that a parent who has a child with mental or physical needs/support is naturally exhausted (especially with a deadbeat ex involved who doesn't share the parenting load), but it's unfair to throw a tantrum because you're not getting your own way regardless of the situation. We see far too many posts, especially on this sub, where family bullying others to conform or submit seems to be the norm.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable doing something, and for valid reasons, that should be the end of the conversation. Your brother is seeing his partner's raw emotions and not the full picture, don't let his reaction influence your opinion.\n\nHave you discussed this with your OH/mum/close friend? What's their reaction? Are you being supported?", "NTA\n\nThis is a gut reaction: Claire wants to play-act that Bea is her daughter. I\u2019m willing to reveal my superpower is elastic arms for the length of this reach, but that was my immediate gut reaction to your story. \n\nYou\u2019re 100% right, a break from childcare wouldn\u2019t involve babysitting someone else\u2019s child while someone babysits yours. If she had suggested to take Bea with her family one day and you take Ruby with yours a different day, that would equal a break for each of you.\n\nHer tantrum and the constant focus in her negotiation of wanting to flat out switch children could be that she knows Ruby would be too much for you to handle on your own. To prevent you from calling up and cancelling the swap after an hour she could be planning to guilt you into keeping Ruby for the day with \u201chow upset would Bea be if you cut her day short\u201d type manipulations. And that is far more reasonable a speculation. But her tantrum showed you that she doesn\u2019t cope with raising her child easily, nor does Ruby\u2019s father, he\u2019s probably not as flaky as she makes out just that he\u2019s equally challenged by raising her.\n\nBut with the extra info of all the unprompted offers of babysitting when you\u2019ve never needed her to. So she doesn\u2019t cope well with her own daughter but wants the responsibility of adding another child to her load? My gut remains on she wants to play pretend.", "NTA at all. This is straight up weird. \n\nDoing things together with both kids? Sure, that's something one could agree to. But for a mother to actively leave her own child behind because she needs a break, but then getting another child for the outing, is just strange! Sounds like she'd rather just take Bea home after the holidays, too, and leave Ruby to you. Stand your ground on this!", "NTA\n\"No\" is a complete sentence and should be respected.  It's not yours, or your child's, job to make her *feel* better about anything.\n\nThe disturbing part of this for me is her almost dehumanizing both children for her own experience.  Your brother needs to pay close attention to how she's behaving about this incident because it's exposing how self serving she is in her relationships...just saying.", "NTA. They are your respective kids, not some tokens to be passed around. If Claire needs a break she should call it what she needs and that is a baby sitter", "NTA. This all sounds very strange. If Ruby has behavioral issues, her mother needs to discuss this with you, not just try to dump her on you and escape for the day using your child as an excuse. Very odd.", "NTA. Claire was not being honest about what she wants, which is probably a break from what must be quite hard parenting of her daughter. She needs to say that.", "100% NTA. It\u2019s your child. If you don\u2019t want them spending a day with Claire, then that should be the end of it. And also, if you don\u2019t want to babysit a child for a \u201cchild-swap\u201d, then why should you? If they want a break from their own child, they\u2019re the problem, not you.", "Honestly, I get the feeling that Claire doesn\u2019t like her daughter. Poor Ruby.\n\nNTA", "Her idea of having a break and an enjoyable holiday is to spend it being with another child? \n\nTo me this sounds like she holds a lot of resentment towards her daughter & likes to play pretend with your daughter.", "NTA\n\nShe's your child, you don't need a reason to refuse to give her away. The others are complete AH for trying to take your child away from you. It does not matter that it's just a few hours, their behaviour is unacceptable.\n\nThe same goes for babysitting others' kid : it's a huge responsibility, no one can force you into it.", "NTA. There\u2019s a much more honest way that Claire could have done this. If she wanted a day out with your daughter she could arrange with her husband to look after Ruby. How she\u2019s asked it is bizarre and convoluted.", "Seems pretty sad that she sees her daughter as such a burden that she wont have an enjoyable holiday.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is a bit odd. I guess Claire wants help with Ruby, which I get. It's tough looking after a child with special needs. But she needs to be up front with that, not calling it a swap, which sounds all fair and dandy, until you realise it's a child... To be honest, giving Claire and Charles an afternoon off would be kind, but you need to get to know Ruby more. You've only met her twice, and she's 8. (That's a bit odd too...) Lastly, when my children were young, it was easier to have 2 than 1. They played together and I just supervised. Having one I had to do it all. So, after getting to know Ruby, and if you felt confident, maybe offer to have Ruby to play with Bea. Claire and Charles can go out together. But a swap.... no, that's not going to happen.", "bro what??? Why the hell would anyone think this is a normal request? The normal thing is to offer to take both families ice skating? This is just weird. If someone told me this about my own kid Id laugh felling quite sure that they're joking\n\nNTA, not even close. What is wrong with this woman?", "Bro she definitely resents having a special needs child and using your daughter to \u201cfeel\u201d what it\u2019s like to have a normal child. I wouldn\u2019t let her near your daughter if i were you, this could escalate to something worse if her obsession with your daughter grows.", "Poor Ruby.\n\nNTA", "Give an inch and they'll take a mile. \n\nIf you agree now, I am damn sure it won't be the last time she'll ask for a \"kid swap.\"\n\nNTA. Stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nThe fact they she said she wanted the holiday to be a break from her child is sad. She wanted your daughter for the holiday, because she sees your child as less of a burden than her own.\n\nDo not give into her. She is doing this for selfish reasons, and thinks it is okay to discard her daughter for celebrations because her daughter is disabled.", "NTA\n\nThe situation makes you uncomfortable and that\u2019s enough to say \u201cno\u201d. Don\u2019t let anyone else push your parental boundaries.", "No you're fine. Everything you said is fine. I wouldn't leave my child with anyone i didn't know fully. I just cant, its called being a responsible parent. Shes only 4. My 2.5 year old i seldom leave with grandparents and i was not ok them taking her to the shopping centre without me cause toddlers run fast and i really wasn't going to be ok with it. So much can go wrong around sharp skates that i dont even want to imagine it - nope, nope and nope.", "NTA. It sounds like Claire wants a break from Ruby and wants to play happy families with a \u201cnormal\u201d kid. That\u2019s really fucking weird. That\u2019s not the right way to go about seeking additional support or a break.\n\nEdit to add after I read the post again - if you brother wants to give his girlfriend a break, he can babysit Ruby. As he said, you don\u2019t need a degree to look after a kid for a few hours. If he\u2019s going to have a future with Claire, he needs to spend more time with Ruby.", "Yeah, she's 100% wanting to live out her \"normal\" daughter life with your child and foist off her actually daughter so she can play pretend of what might have been. Gross, worrying for Ruby, and potentially dangerous for Bea.\n\nI would draw back contact, at least for anything involving Bea, because there are enough red flags here to outfit a Soviet parade.\n\nNTA", "You're NTA. \n\n>Charles says I\u2019m massively overdramatising and that babysitting Ruby for a few hours doesn\u2019t need a degree and I should just help Claire out. \n\nThe he can watch his possibly soon to be stepdaughter for a day while his girlfriend has a day off and goes sightseeing or whatever she wants to do without her child.", "Not only are you not the asshole, but I would be very careful around the two of them and leaving them alone with your child at all. I'm not wanting to put horrid thoughts in your mind, but a lot of abusers and p3d0s start by being that close figure to the child. There is no reason she is obligated to have alone time with your child \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA \n\nIt sounds to me that Clare wants a break from dealing with her own child and her additional needs to spend time with a child that doesn't have these difficulties. To me it sounds like she doesn't really like her own child that much. \n\nIt's not yours or your child's job to make her feel better, and she should take no for an answer and not create a problem. I would re think them coming on the trip because i believe she will keep pushing this.", "NTA. It\u2019s strange. Also, trust your gut instincts here.", "NTA. Claire can ask, you can say no, that should be the end of it.", "NTA at all. That's super weird on her part.", "NTA - She already gave it away that she wants to not have to look after her own child so she can have a break, obviously she's pitching it differently to others.  It's quite a weird request even if she didn't have an ulterior motive.  If she's so intent on spending time with your child she can look after both and you can have a day off", "NTA. This is weird.  It sounds like she's playing out her fantasize of what she expected parenting to be like with your daughter.  That's not healthy.", "NTA it\u2019s not what you planned for your holiday and you don\u2019t know then that well yet. Your never obligated to look after someone else\u2019s kid or let them look after yours. It\u2019s also not your fault that her baby daddy is a flake.", "NTA.\n\nI am European, and have six weeks of paid vacation a year. But I would still not want to swap a day off with my child in the holiday season for babysitting another child. I love my children and I want to spend my free time with them.\n\nIt only adds to the desicion that her child has special needs and that you don't even know the child. \n\nIf she needs a break, she can get a babysitter. She doesn't get my child to play happy family with and robbing me of my holiday memories.", "Absolutely not! Don\u2019t do it!\n\nNTA", "\nNTA at all. This is all bizarre behaviour and it looks (from where I'm standing) like she got a daughter she resents and is trying to live a \"typical mother daughter relationship\" vicariously through using your daughter as a prop. This is alarming. Please do not leave your daughter with her for even a minute. She sounds unhinged.", ">Claire said I was being unfair and that she deserves a break and to have an enjoyable holiday, too.\n\nAnd there it is. She was trying to palm off her child to you, so she gets a break. \n\nParenting special needs children is not easy. I know as I grew up with a special needs sister whom I love but dear lord, is she a handful sometimes. So I do feel for her, but she has not just come out and said that ... She could have been open and honest, hey guys, I'm exhausted and I need a little break, could you please help me with childcare during the trip. She went about it very sneakily and that's what makes her definitely the AH in the situation. \n\nNTA", "NTA honestly her request is really odd and would make me really uncomfortable. \n\nIt sounds like she wants to replace her child with yours and that\u2019s ringing some major alarm bells. If I were you I wouldn\u2019t allow her to be alone with your child anymore.", "NTA this is just weird. People don't even swap dogs for a day let alone a child. I get the vibe that the one day swap might be a few days of \"she kid napped my child\" because this is seriously off", "Absolutely NTA, the demand from Claire is creepy and her reaction to your refusal is a red flag. Be very watchful, OP.", "In general, people just aren\u2019t chill these days. Everyone seems to actively look for a potential fault or personal slight in so many situations where in previous generations it wouldn\u2019t have been much of a thing to the vast majority of people. \n\nNTA but there\u2019s no harm in letting your daughter have a fun afternoon with them. A more empathetic person might have intuitively known that there are a lot privileges and joys of parenting that someone with a high needs child misses out on. Their intentions are completely benign and not at all selfish, it benefits your daughter on top of that. I\u2019d like to think that in the same situation I\u2019d have a bit of love for my fellow human and see how it benefits them greatly, your daughter a little bit and harms you not much at all. The kid won\u2019t die on your watch, they\u2019re probably lovely and if not it would be an affirmation of how beneficial this would be to the parents. We all need to get out of our heads more.\n\nAs I say though, NTA. People work hard for holidays and are entitled to spend all of that time with their children. A couple of days is a bit much, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to two days even if I agreed to an outing.", "NTA\n\nTrust your gut. \n\nOR\n\nYou have a gut for a reason: heed it.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain). \n\n\u201cNo, that doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d", "She has issues girl.\n\nAnd I wasn\u2019t talking about her kid", "This is weird.

She can spend time with her own kid.", "NTA", "Oh I think she went about it very badly, but I can kind of see why she wants the experience of taking a child Iceskating. \nI think it\u2019s normal to want to do fun things and experience these things with kids. I get joy out of taking my nephew to do activities, and having little outings can be fun. \nI\u2019ve certainly ended up unintentionally swapping kids when one or the other wanted to whichever activity the other kids parent was up to, I\u2019ve had siblings and cousins and random friends along for all sorts of adventures. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s not necessarily weird or malicious, I think the fact her daughter has a disability is making some people have very strong opinions. I\u2019d be pretty crushed if someone thought there was malice behind my kiddo hanging out with her aunt and uncle for a few days, and their younger kiddo hanging with me - we both got some respite from our daily challenges, spent lovely time with our respective niece/nephew and the kids had fun too. \n\nI hope it\u2019s something really benign and you work something out.

Special needs kids can't get randomly passed over to untrained unwilling carers for the day. Deserving a break and an \"enjoyable holiday\" shouldn't involving dumping your daughter and borrowing someone else's as a younger easier option.

If truth be told, it's somewhat of a prison sentence for the caregivers, in extreme situations. I know there's a child involved, and they didn't ask to be born with the problems they have, but they're not the only victims when life plays such cruel tricks. \n\nFor those reasons, I can understand Claire wanting to experience time with a \"typical\" child she apparently enjoys very much; however, it's extremely inappropriate for her to expect you to take care of a special needs child in exchange, with whom you are not familiar.

Now that Ruby\u2019s coming, she wants to proceed with the plan anyway, but now it\u2019s extra weird because she will need someone to care for Ruby while she\u2019s busy playing happy family with her boyfriend\u2019s niece. \n\nShe probably doesn\u2019t get how weird her request is because she would love for someone to take Ruby off her hands. She may even be trying to force a bond between Ruby and you, something that can be particularly difficult for children with special needs.

Maybe in further discussions, focus on the impact to Ruby and her feelings instead of on how weird it is to be focused on Bea.

We took her last year to this same rink and they have times for kids to skate that normally just kids under 5 with instructors supervising on the ice", "But then Claire can't pretend that Bea is her daughter \ud83d\ude22", "I\u2019m not going to throw my mum under the bus here, she didn\u2019t say I should babysit. She just said she feels bad for Claire, which I do too. Claire was really looking forward to this holiday", "Wanting to have those experiences is normal and human. Actually requesting this, pressuring OP to say yes, and then getting upset when she doesn\u2019t get her way is both abnormal and extremely inappropriate. \n\nDemanding someone babysit your disabled child that they have only met twice is not normal. It\u2019s not just a large ask of OP, it\u2019s also potentially dangerous or traumatizing to the child as well.\n\nIt\u2019s normal and human for me to want a luxury car. It\u2019s not normal and human for me to go to my friend and ask if I can switch his brand new BMW with my 20 year old car for the day so I can role play as Richy Rich. And that\u2019s a car, not a human being", "They don\u2019t live together, nor are they planning to, they have a very sort of \u201cdating\u201d relationship which works well for them.

Needs that are significant, from what she\u2019s said in other comments, and that she has no training or experience with? Claire doesn\u2019t seem at all uncomfortable leaving her daughter with someone not at all equipped to care for her, but OP is the bad guy here?", "Yep, thanks for demonstrating once again what lack of comprehension is. You do a marvelous job at that. And the arrogant judgmental tone just adds so much nuance... truly an outstanding trait. And the fact that you're here calling strangers out for not sacrificing their time like you're doing with yours... inspiring. Now you hear me out, some people might try to accuse you of hypocrisy for not putting your phone down and go do charity work like a good sympathetic person should. Do not listen to them, your work here is just as important, if not more important than all that hungry homeless nonsense. It's all fine.", "It sounds like a natural progression of the conversation, kind of like a negotiation, as she wasn't getting an agreement on the initial request.\n\nIf you don't think it is a big deal, you are welcome to babysit in those situations. OP is not comfortable and that is all that matters. There is no obligation to babysit a kid who isn't yours on holiday.\n\nIt is also a little icky to want to ditch your own kid to take someone else's kid on an outing. For most kid swaps, the people take turns watching all the kids so everyone gets some adult time.", "I think the main issue is the swap.  Bringing Bea along with them while they all go ice skating is one thing.  Even saying I need a break and want to go out one on one with my BF/your brother, can you look after my daughter for a few is fine.  Saying here, take my child and I'll take yours is something else altogether.", "It\u2019s absolutely a big deal to ask a relative to take care of your special needs child when that relative has expressed that she doesn\u2019t know how to care for her and doesn\u2019t feel comfortable being responsible for her care.", "As a father to a child with severe autism; I disagree, even a few hours without the tools/knowledge for how to work with a special needs child is a recipe for disaster. It would possibly be traumatic for both OP and for the child.", ">If it's for a few hours, then I don't think this is really a big deal at all\n\nBut OP has only met this child twice.", "You are not taking the \"special needs\" into consideration. We don't know what they are, but they sound severe.", "This is what I was thinking. Wanting to swap kids for a few hours doesn't seem like a huge deal to me in and of itself. OP is still free to say no, of course, but it does seem like the kind of thing you might offer to do for someone if you like them and know they're struggling. She doesn't even have to do the \"swap\" part - just say, I'll watch the girls while you and and my brother have some alone time. Find a compromise is the point.", ">If it's for a few hours, then I don't think this is really a big deal at all.\n\nI think that massively depends on Ruby's care and support needs. \n\nA few hours with a kid that is developmentally delayed and maybe doesn't quite act like a nondisabled child of their age is one thing, maybe you have to play with them and entertain them slightly differently. But a few hours with a kid that has specific medical needs or equipment, or has a lot of behavioural or sensory issues can be quite different. And both are more difficult if you don't know them well enough to understand their needs or behaviour or they don't know YOU well enough to feel comfortable and not get distressed. \n\nAnd I think it's odd that OP offered to do things with both kids and families together, which would give them that time to get to know Ruby and maybe even build up to being able to help out with her and babysit her one day if she was comfortable with that, but that offer was declined. Feels weird.", "This is completely the correct read.\n\nShe would hire or find appropriate care and JOIN you if she was not malicious.\n\nBe cautious and maybe take a step back.

He needs to protect you and your child over this woman\u2019s emotional needs.", ">Claiee spent both those occasions trying to calm Ruby down because she was being loud and disruptive.\n\nAnd she thinks you taking Ruby is going to be a break for you.

If they wanted alone time without Ruby, that would be one thing, but taking Bea as the token \"normal\" child to fulfill Claire's holiday fantasy is an insult to both kids. Bea is not a prop. Ruby doesn't deserve to be left behind while her cousin takes her place.

Even for one day. \nWhere it went wrong is that she got caught up in those wishes and dreams.", "I said that since he thinks caring for Ruby is not so hard, offer to schedule a spa day for just Claire and make it clear to your brother it is when you and everyone else will be unavailable (like \u201coh, mom and dad have X and we decided we could take Bea to Y at that time, so we thought it would be a good time for Claire to get her break and you can watch Ruby, after all, it is only a few hours and it isn\u2019t hard, right?\u201d)\n\nI ask again, has he always been this selfish and inconsiderate of your time? \n\nOr even, say you will consider having a girls day with Claire, your mom, and Bea and he can watch Ruby during that time.\n\nI promise, he will insist he can\u2019t possibly and call you an asshole for even suggesting it. Because it isn\u2019t just about Claire getting her fantasy or getting a break, it\u2019s about him getting the time with Claire without the hassle of Ruby.", "Do not let yourself be talked into this. If this was allowed then she would only want more, it would then be officially an obsession, I don't agree with you that she is not obsessed. This would make matters worse. I would have a calm chat with your brother and let him know your concerns,. It may end up with you having to go low contact. She also needs help to cope with her own daughter and her special needs.", "NTA, and while I completely understand where you\u2019re uncomfortable, has anyone thought how Ruby might feel about all this?", "I would think that agreeing to babysit for a day for a few hours would be fine, but it depends on Ruby - is she aware of what is happening around her, is she mentally developed and on what level, what does caring for her includes? Like would she be embarrassed or uncomfortable with someone changing her diaper if she wears one? Does the person caring for her need to know about some medical signs to look for? Would she be scared? \n\nAnd that includes only her comfort, you also need to look at what you would be comfortable with.\n\nBut for a few days? That is weird.", "Most 4 year olds are pretty happy with attention especially a special outing. It could be that she is shy or anxious but OP didn\u2019t mention that. I was a SAHM for a year when my older kid was in JK and the number of times a working mom would ask me to grab her kid and call the school to allow it - some of those kids I barely knew but they would happily come to eat arrowroot cookies and play with the toys. Most kids in daycare and preschool are pretty easygoing. It doesn\u2019t sound like the daughter is objecting just the mom.", "Nothing wrong with a parent in this situation wanting to try and move away from their struggles for a short time. \n\nYou do not get parenting a special needs child is difficult. \n\nIt couldn\u2019t be more clear that you know nothing about what you are speaking. Your assumptions and opinion on this matter are disgusting.", "If you don\u2019t like the metaphor then just change it so I drive a beater and my friend has a very average, run of the mill car. It shouldn\u2019t be a luxury to have a car with AC that reliably starts and it\u2019s normal for me to want a new one.\n\nMy entire point is that in a situation like that it would not be ok to ask someone to switch cars for a day, it is both a bizarre and inappropriate thing to ask someone. To take the metaphor even further it\u2019s an especially unfair request for my friend to have to drive around a beater all day that might break down on his way to work.", "No, he hasn\u2019t, and he\u2019s not usually. \n\nI\u2019m not going to tit for tat with him though what would be the point? He\u2019s not going to babysit. And yes he\u2019d then have to admit he\u2019s wrong but it\u2019s just not worth the hassle", "I need to reread this again because I thought that\u2019s what Claire was asking for. Take turns watching both kids so the adults can have adult time. \n\nAn exchange is absolutely wild and Claire needs therapy to unpack this. It\u2019s no doubt tough to care for a special needs child but her mindset is extremely unhealthy.", "I don't think it's weird. At that age kids act differently with their parents around.   When you're the person of authority/protection instead of the parents the way they treat you totally can change. My son became a little angle when it was just him and his grandma and it allowed him to open up to things he would resist more with me.  \n\n Also it sounded like her husband would also be there so not like it was her just wanting complete alone time.", "Yup. Red flags here.", "It's not rocket science to understand that parenting a special needs child is hard. So yes, I get it, I understand it. \n\nThat still doesn't change he fact that she can not just swap her kid out like a car. Like ops kid is some prop she's going to borrow for a few days. \n\nThis has nothing to do with her needing a break, becauseif that was the case then she wouldn't want to take any kid ice skating \n\nShe wants to play pretend. And if her kid is \"normal\"\n\nStop acting like the gf is looking for a break. This has nothing to do with her kid having special needs.\n\nEveryone commenting on ops post, can see that the gf just wants to play pretend family. That's why she said she wanted to swap kids. \n\nSHE SAID SHE WANTS TO SWAP KIDS \n\nIf she needed a break thts perfectly fine and she should do that. But she taking ops kid with her to go ice skating isn't her taking a break. \n\nI get why your so upset, and im sorry that life I'd hard for you. \n\nI think all parents should have a break and I agree 100% that their should be more programs to he'll give parents of special needs kids, a break so they can avoid burnout. I get it, I really do. \n\nMy issue isn't about the kid. It was about the mother and how she was viewing the whole thing. \n\nShe never asked for a break. She wanted to BORROW ops kid for a few days. That's not ok.", "Still, if he doesn't intend to be there for RUby, they shouldn't be dating", "If she is being invited on family vacation, it is not casual. Charlies needs to think if this relationship is something he wants. Cause if he is not wanting to became invovled with Ruby, he needs to break up with Claire now and stop wasting her time.", "Oh my lord. You can ask. Live with the answer being no and don't throw a tantrum. Is it like finest behavior? No not at all. But it is not horrendous either. Especially when you make clear that you just admire their car and wish u could drive one like that. \n\nBut you can't compare things to humans. This is a mother grieving what she can't have, trying to get it for just one day. She needs help, therapy and compassion. Not being called words. \n\nAs I said the way she behaved wasn't okay. Not in a thousand years. But she isn't the asshole either. This is a complex situation that evolved out of a difficult experience, and many negative emotions.", "I see your point re: being the bigger person and not going tit for tat", "Oh, oops.", "It depends on exactly what Ruby is capable of, maybe she can\u2019t go out.", "And I would be seriously fucking pissed if I found out my mom loaned me out to some creep who was obsessed with me because I was her \"ideal\" child. It's gross to act like children are pets or shoes you borrow.", "I agree in general but I think your last line there is a little harsh. Having an atypical child is not something anyone is really prepared for and I have compassion for the sister wanting to experience a different life which has different and perhaps less regular challenges. What I'm not ok with is her being do forceful about doing so", "If your request (hey, I want to do X with your kid while you Y with my kid) is what Claire requested, I would feel less uncomfortable with the request.", "Why are you the only option as babysitter for Ruby? There will be other adults there, yes?", "This! \u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f\u261d\ufe0f", "> ask if she wouldn't mind watching Ruby for a few hrs to give Claire a break for a few hrs\n\nIf that's how they initially presented it, it would have been more honest.  But it's not.  And even if they had, it's not at all unreasonable for OP to decline.", "There is much more to it than asking for a break and that\u2019s what you and other commenters don\u2019t understand. Hopefully you never have to.", "And for Charles to invite Claire and Ruby along on family vacation!", "Who said Claire wants that? \n\nThat\u2019s a myopic view to take. If their relationship works for them then so be it", "I think we mostly agree. The desire itself is not necessarily wrong but the actions that followed were. I still do think the initial request is out of line because it is a big ask to have someone watch a disabled child that they do not have experience with. It would be very different if she asked for everyone to go to the ice rink together, other family members were still around, and she got to have her moment skating with her niece. To be fair we do not know the extent of this child\u2019s disability though \n\nI say this as someone that has a sibling with Down Syndrome. That is actually probably is the reason that I got so \u201ctriggered\u201d by this post to be honest. I know how difficult it can be to be responsible for a child with special needs. I also know how traumatizing it can be for a child with special needs to be in a situation where their parents/support system are gone and they are left somewhere unfamiliar with people they barely know.\n\nAt the end of the day the behavior just really rubs me the wrong way. Like you said these are people not objects. The disabled child does not deserve to be passed on to someone else, left out of a fun day, and potentially traumatized. The daughter does not deserve to be treated like a purse dog so auntie can live out her \u201cKodak moment\u201d fantasy", "Yes, exactly. It's not ditching their own kid as much as it is experiencing a different type of parenting that may be less intensive. I understand that 100%. It's just the part where she keeps pushing for it after OP has clearly said no.", "That\u2019s not her sister tho. It\u2019s her brothers girlfriend who has only brought ruby around twice. Also no, this is one of the things that need to be discussed when you are preparing to have children with someone. Unfortunately most don\u2019t make it to the talk or simply don\u2019t realize it\u2019s a talk that needs to be had. Having a child isn\u2019t like adopting a pet! They are WHOLE ASS PEOPLE, whom we are supposed to protect while they get to adulthood and then some. Kids are not accessories for Claire\u2019s creepy cosplay. Not gonna lie, she should be spending figuring out what she can do with her own daughter instead.", "I suspect there is some really awful \u201cbut OP is a woman, she should WANT to sacrifice her holiday to watch this child and give the mom a break\u201d thinking going on. They may have already tried it on OP\u2019s mom who shut that down hard.", "I guess she has nothing to \u201cswap\u201d with my parents \ud83d\ude02\n\nJk but I really think she wants a day of having a \u201ctypical\u201d child experience and my parents don\u2019t have a typical kid for her to take skating", "If you can understand why someone who cannot conceive a child of their own would want to adopt a child so that they can experience parenthood without that biological connection, you should be able to understand why a woman who has a child with limited abilities would want the opportunity to experience parenting a child without those limitations.\n\nI am in no way suggesting that Claire should be able to live out her fantasy of having a child without Ruby's limitations through being granted access to Bea. I am suggesting that we give Claire grace when considering her situation and have sympathy for her.", "The answer is very clearly and 100% not demanding to swap kids with op.", "You're being too easy on him. He's the one in a relationship with Claire. He should be doing things to take care of her. Like taking care of her daughter for a few hours to give her a break.", "Yeah. That\u2019s the obvious part. But I don\u2019t see why she can\u2019t ask someone else to babysit and also ask if she can take bea out. Other than that Claire KNOWS the optics are bad and will make it obvious that she just wants to hang out with a NT child. \n\nIt\u2019s sad. But she\u2019s the one making it weird. Your suggestion of going all together is normal and makes sense. She could still ask for you to watch Ruby while they took Bea around a couple times on the rink. And it could\u2019ve been a nice family experience. Instead, Claire stepped way out of her lane and made it awkward."]}
