Her attitude around your child is strange, at best, and it looks like that Claire has something to unpack with a professional therapist.\n\nFrankly, I'd be quite uncomfortable too, leaving my daugther with a woman who seems slightly obsessed with her.", "NTA. Claire wants to spend time doing parental activities with a child who doesn't have any special needs. It's not \"babysitting\" as such - it's substitution as she's unable to do them with her own daughter.\n\nI have a great deal of sympathy for her. She's watching everyone else get the Kodak moments that we all picture before becoming parents, yet they're denied to her with her own child.\n\nHowever, you are in no way required to help her get those moments at your own cost - not to mention you would be enabling her to exclude her own child in favour of yours.\n\nIt's a tough situation for Claire, but ultimately one she has to deal with herself - and not by doing this. I could see her getting possessive of your daughter as well, so you are doing the right thing by nipping it in the bud straight away.", "NTA\n\nI know some people may downvote this, as we can all empathize that a parent who has a child with mental or physical needs/support is naturally exhausted (especially with a deadbeat ex involved who doesn't share the parenting load), but it's unfair to throw a tantrum because you're not getting your own way regardless of the situation. We see far too many posts, especially on this sub, where family bullying others to conform or submit seems to be the norm.\n\nIf you aren't comfortable doing something, and for valid reasons, that should be the end of the conversation. Your brother is seeing his partner's raw emotions and not the full picture, don't let his reaction influence your opinion.\n\nHave you discussed this with your OH/mum/close friend? What's their reaction? Are you being supported?", "NTA\n\nThis is a gut reaction: Claire wants to play-act that Bea is her daughter. I\u2019m willing to reveal my superpower is elastic arms for the length of this reach, but that was my immediate gut reaction to your story. \n\nYou\u2019re 100% right, a break from childcare wouldn\u2019t involve babysitting someone else\u2019s child while someone babysits yours. If she had suggested to take Bea with her family one day and you take Ruby with yours a different day, that would equal a break for each of you.\n\nHer tantrum and the constant focus in her negotiation of wanting to flat out switch children could be that she knows Ruby would be too much for you to handle on your own. To prevent you from calling up and cancelling the swap after an hour she could be planning to guilt you into keeping Ruby for the day with \u201chow upset would Bea be if you cut her day short\u201d type manipulations. And that is far more reasonable a speculation. But her tantrum showed you that she doesn\u2019t cope with raising her child easily, nor does Ruby\u2019s father, he\u2019s probably not as flaky as she makes out just that he\u2019s equally challenged by raising her.\n\nBut with the extra info of all the unprompted offers of babysitting when you\u2019ve never needed her to. So she doesn\u2019t cope well with her own daughter but wants the responsibility of adding another child to her load? My gut remains on she wants to play pretend.", "NTA at all. This is straight up weird. \n\nDoing things together with both kids? Sure, that's something one could agree to. But for a mother to actively leave her own child behind because she needs a break, but then getting another child for the outing, is just strange! Sounds like she'd rather just take Bea home after the holidays, too, and leave Ruby to you. Stand your ground on this!", "NTA\n\"No\" is a complete sentence and should be respected.  It's not yours, or your child's, job to make her *feel* better about anything.\n\nThe disturbing part of this for me is her almost dehumanizing both children for her own experience.  Your brother needs to pay close attention to how she's behaving about this incident because it's exposing how self serving she is in her relationships...just saying.", "NTA. They are your respective kids, not some tokens to be passed around. If Claire needs a break she should call it what she needs and that is a baby sitter", "NTA. This all sounds very strange. If Ruby has behavioral issues, her mother needs to discuss this with you, not just try to dump her on you and escape for the day using your child as an excuse. Very odd.", "NTA. Claire was not being honest about what she wants, which is probably a break from what must be quite hard parenting of her daughter. She needs to say that.", "100% NTA. It\u2019s your child. If you don\u2019t want them spending a day with Claire, then that should be the end of it. And also, if you don\u2019t want to babysit a child for a \u201cchild-swap\u201d, then why should you? If they want a break from their own child, they\u2019re the problem, not you.", "Honestly, I get the feeling that Claire doesn\u2019t like her daughter. Poor Ruby.\n\nNTA", "Her idea of having a break and an enjoyable holiday is to spend it being with another child? \n\nTo me this sounds like she holds a lot of resentment towards her daughter & likes to play pretend with your daughter.", "NTA\n\nShe's your child, you don't need a reason to refuse to give her away. The others are complete AH for trying to take your child away from you. It does not matter that it's just a few hours, their behaviour is unacceptable.\n\nThe same goes for babysitting others' kid : it's a huge responsibility, no one can force you into it.", "NTA. There\u2019s a much more honest way that Claire could have done this. If she wanted a day out with your daughter she could arrange with her husband to look after Ruby. How she\u2019s asked it is bizarre and convoluted.", "Seems pretty sad that she sees her daughter as such a burden that she wont have an enjoyable holiday.\n\nNTA", "NTA. This is a bit odd. I guess Claire wants help with Ruby, which I get. It's tough looking after a child with special needs. But she needs to be up front with that, not calling it a swap, which sounds all fair and dandy, until you realise it's a child... To be honest, giving Claire and Charles an afternoon off would be kind, but you need to get to know Ruby more. You've only met her twice, and she's 8. (That's a bit odd too...) Lastly, when my children were young, it was easier to have 2 than 1. They played together and I just supervised. Having one I had to do it all. So, after getting to know Ruby, and if you felt confident, maybe offer to have Ruby to play with Bea. Claire and Charles can go out together. But a swap.... no, that's not going to happen.", "bro what??? Why the hell would anyone think this is a normal request? The normal thing is to offer to take both families ice skating? This is just weird. If someone told me this about my own kid Id laugh felling quite sure that they're joking\n\nNTA, not even close. What is wrong with this woman?", "Bro she definitely resents having a special needs child and using your daughter to \u201cfeel\u201d what it\u2019s like to have a normal child. I wouldn\u2019t let her near your daughter if i were you, this could escalate to something worse if her obsession with your daughter grows.", "Poor Ruby.\n\nNTA", "Give an inch and they'll take a mile. \n\nIf you agree now, I am damn sure it won't be the last time she'll ask for a \"kid swap.\"\n\nNTA. Stand your ground.", "NTA\n\nThe fact they she said she wanted the holiday to be a break from her child is sad. She wanted your daughter for the holiday, because she sees your child as less of a burden than her own.\n\nDo not give into her. She is doing this for selfish reasons, and thinks it is okay to discard her daughter for celebrations because her daughter is disabled.", "NTA\n\nThe situation makes you uncomfortable and that\u2019s enough to say \u201cno\u201d. Don\u2019t let anyone else push your parental boundaries.", "No you're fine. Everything you said is fine. I wouldn't leave my child with anyone i didn't know fully. I just cant, its called being a responsible parent. Shes only 4. My 2.5 year old i seldom leave with grandparents and i was not ok them taking her to the shopping centre without me cause toddlers run fast and i really wasn't going to be ok with it. So much can go wrong around sharp skates that i dont even want to imagine it - nope, nope and nope.", "NTA. It sounds like Claire wants a break from Ruby and wants to play happy families with a \u201cnormal\u201d kid. That\u2019s really fucking weird. That\u2019s not the right way to go about seeking additional support or a break.\n\nEdit to add after I read the post again - if you brother wants to give his girlfriend a break, he can babysit Ruby. As he said, you don\u2019t need a degree to look after a kid for a few hours. If he\u2019s going to have a future with Claire, he needs to spend more time with Ruby.", "Yeah, she's 100% wanting to live out her \"normal\" daughter life with your child and foist off her actually daughter so she can play pretend of what might have been. Gross, worrying for Ruby, and potentially dangerous for Bea.\n\nI would draw back contact, at least for anything involving Bea, because there are enough red flags here to outfit a Soviet parade.\n\nNTA", "You're NTA. \n\n>Charles says I\u2019m massively overdramatising and that babysitting Ruby for a few hours doesn\u2019t need a degree and I should just help Claire out. \n\nThe he can watch his possibly soon to be stepdaughter for a day while his girlfriend has a day off and goes sightseeing or whatever she wants to do without her child.", "Not only are you not the asshole, but I would be very careful around the two of them and leaving them alone with your child at all. I'm not wanting to put horrid thoughts in your mind, but a lot of abusers and p3d0s start by being that close figure to the child. There is no reason she is obligated to have alone time with your child \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9", "NTA \n\nIt sounds to me that Clare wants a break from dealing with her own child and her additional needs to spend time with a child that doesn't have these difficulties. To me it sounds like she doesn't really like her own child that much. \n\nIt's not yours or your child's job to make her feel better, and she should take no for an answer and not create a problem. I would re think them coming on the trip because i believe she will keep pushing this.", "NTA. It\u2019s strange. Also, trust your gut instincts here.", "NTA. Claire can ask, you can say no, that should be the end of it.", "NTA at all. That's super weird on her part.", "NTA - She already gave it away that she wants to not have to look after her own child so she can have a break, obviously she's pitching it differently to others.  It's quite a weird request even if she didn't have an ulterior motive.  If she's so intent on spending time with your child she can look after both and you can have a day off", "NTA. This is weird.  It sounds like she's playing out her fantasize of what she expected parenting to be like with your daughter.  That's not healthy.", "NTA it\u2019s not what you planned for your holiday and you don\u2019t know then that well yet. Your never obligated to look after someone else\u2019s kid or let them look after yours. It\u2019s also not your fault that her baby daddy is a flake.", "NTA.\n\nI am European, and have six weeks of paid vacation a year. But I would still not want to swap a day off with my child in the holiday season for babysitting another child. I love my children and I want to spend my free time with them.\n\nIt only adds to the desicion that her child has special needs and that you don't even know the child. \n\nIf she needs a break, she can get a babysitter. She doesn't get my child to play happy family with and robbing me of my holiday memories.", "Absolutely not! Don\u2019t do it!\n\nNTA", "\nNTA at all. This is all bizarre behaviour and it looks (from where I'm standing) like she got a daughter she resents and is trying to live a \"typical mother daughter relationship\" vicariously through using your daughter as a prop. This is alarming. Please do not leave your daughter with her for even a minute. She sounds unhinged.", ">Claire said I was being unfair and that she deserves a break and to have an enjoyable holiday, too.\n\nAnd there it is. She was trying to palm off her child to you, so she gets a break. \n\nParenting special needs children is not easy. I know as I grew up with a special needs sister whom I love but dear lord, is she a handful sometimes. So I do feel for her, but she has not just come out and said that ... She could have been open and honest, hey guys, I'm exhausted and I need a little break, could you please help me with childcare during the trip. She went about it very sneakily and that's what makes her definitely the AH in the situation. \n\nNTA", "NTA honestly her request is really odd and would make me really uncomfortable. \n\nIt sounds like she wants to replace her child with yours and that\u2019s ringing some major alarm bells. If I were you I wouldn\u2019t allow her to be alone with your child anymore.", "NTA this is just weird. People don't even swap dogs for a day let alone a child. I get the vibe that the one day swap might be a few days of \"she kid napped my child\" because this is seriously off", "Absolutely NTA, the demand from Claire is creepy and her reaction to your refusal is a red flag. Be very watchful, OP.", "In general, people just aren\u2019t chill these days. Everyone seems to actively look for a potential fault or personal slight in so many situations where in previous generations it wouldn\u2019t have been much of a thing to the vast majority of people. \n\nNTA but there\u2019s no harm in letting your daughter have a fun afternoon with them. A more empathetic person might have intuitively known that there are a lot privileges and joys of parenting that someone with a high needs child misses out on. Their intentions are completely benign and not at all selfish, it benefits your daughter on top of that. I\u2019d like to think that in the same situation I\u2019d have a bit of love for my fellow human and see how it benefits them greatly, your daughter a little bit and harms you not much at all. The kid won\u2019t die on your watch, they\u2019re probably lovely and if not it would be an affirmation of how beneficial this would be to the parents. We all need to get out of our heads more.\n\nAs I say though, NTA. People work hard for holidays and are entitled to spend all of that time with their children. A couple of days is a bit much, I wouldn\u2019t have agreed to two days even if I agreed to an outing.", "NTA\n\nTrust your gut. \n\nOR\n\nYou have a gut for a reason: heed it.\n\nYou don\u2019t need to JADE (justify, argue, defend, explain). \n\n\u201cNo, that doesn\u2019t work for me.\u201d", "She has issues girl.\n\nAnd I wasn\u2019t talking about her kid", "This is weird.

She can spend time with her own kid.", "NTA", "Oh I think she went about it very badly, but I can kind of see why she wants the experience of taking a child Iceskating. \nI think it\u2019s normal to want to do fun things and experience these things with kids. I get joy out of taking my nephew to do activities, and having little outings can be fun. \nI\u2019ve certainly ended up unintentionally swapping kids when one or the other wanted to whichever activity the other kids parent was up to, I\u2019ve had siblings and cousins and random friends along for all sorts of adventures. \n\nWhat I\u2019m saying is that it\u2019s not necessarily weird or malicious, I think the fact her daughter has a disability is making some people have very strong opinions. I\u2019d be pretty crushed if someone thought there was malice behind my kiddo hanging out with her aunt and uncle for a few days, and their younger kiddo hanging with me - we both got some respite from our daily challenges, spent lovely time with our respective niece/nephew and the kids had fun too. \n\nI hope it\u2019s something really benign and you work something out.

Special needs kids can't get randomly passed over to untrained unwilling carers for the day. Deserving a break and an \"enjoyable holiday\" shouldn't involving dumping your daughter and borrowing someone else's as a younger easier option.

DO NOT allow her to take advantage of your friendship.", "It's kind of a shit situation for everyone since her dad flaked on having her. I hope it doesn't ruin your holiday, but she probably will try to push you to get to know ruby in the beginning and then play you with the \"but you know her now so you can take her\". So you might want to watch out for that.\n\nPoor woman sounds like she needs a break. Maybe suggest she looks for a service who could take her for a while while she is there?", "The timeline of the swap keeps shrinking the further into the post we get, so I'm not sure if the initial \"few days\", the \"taking her for a day to ice skate\" or the \"few hours\" at the end is the real timeline.\n\nIf it's for a few hours, then I don't think this is really a big deal at all. Ppl regularly do activities with aunts and uncles on holidays.  If it's for a few days, then that's much weirder.", "I\u2019ve only met Ruby twice, neither time Bea was there. \n\nClaiee spent both those occasions trying to calm Ruby down because she was being loud and disruptive. So it wasn\u2019t so much fussing as management", "You could offer to babysit Ruby with your daughter for a short while if you're comfortable with her care.", "Yep, 100% I got the same vibe. Even if she just wants to pretend for a couple of days, it\u2019s clear that Clair is living out a fantasy by this whole swap kids idea.", "This", "Yeah that\u2019s my point. Up until now she\u2019s just wanted to spend time with Bea, and me and Bea together, so I just saw it as like an aunt wanting to spend time with her niece. The *swapping* has made it weird", "We will take Bea ice skating either way and I\u2019d be fine having Claire and Ruby come but Claire said she wouldn\u2019t take Ruby ice skating because in her words, \u201cit\u2019s not feasible\u201d. Which is totally fair enough", "I work in special Ed and have done for ten years. \n\nThe context here (that she's attributing the word normal to Claire) is obvious, so you can probably pipe down with the corrections nobody needed.", "I\u2019m not sure what you mean by \u201chow is he with her\u201d? I\u2019ve only met Ruby twice so I\u2019m really not able to form an opinion. Charles and Claire don\u2019t live together so I\u2019m not sure how much he even sees Ruby. He\u2019s not really big on kids in general so I don\u2019t imagine he\u2019s \u201cDisney stepdad\u201d but he\u2019s always nice to Bea and just generally a nice guy so I presume it\u2019s similar? \n\nHe\u2019s probably not overjoyed Ruby is coming but Claire isn\u2019t either. Also, it definitely wasn\u2019t Charles\u2019s idea to swap kids", "Also, I still don't see any discussion of what her actual needs are from OP's brother.", "I don\u2019t get the impression she\u2019s nefarious, just run down and disappointed her child is coming given that it means her vacation won\u2019t be much of one anymore and she is acting out. Not OPs fault at all though.", "Oh, yeah they\u2019re not married nor do they live together. Charles isn\u2019t really big on kids (I\u2019m not either tbh besides my daughter) so I don\u2019t see him doing too much solo babysitting", "When I said \u201cshe is looking forward\u201d I meant Claire is looking forward to seeing Bea. The kids have never met.", "It\u2019s a few hours each, on separate days. We\u2019re all staying in the same house so she just wants her and Charles to take Bea out for the day", "Even more NTA if you've only met this kid twice - very unfair on both you and the kid to expect you to take her for the entire day, and I imagine if Ruby has special needs that might well be quite distressing for her to be left with effective strangers.", "She expects you to take care of a Special Needs kid you\u2019ve only met twice?", "My dude, she said \u201cI\u2019m not sure how to phrase it\u201d and so I offered how I phrase it since I have to do it quite a lot, because it can be awkward for people who want to use appropriate respectful phrasing and nice for them to have the words. You\u2019re the one making it jerky.", "Is this her way to convince Charles that a child is a nice addition to their relationship? Because it will be a fun, carefree day with Bea", "Charles's incompetence is not your problem.  He is using his incompetence to control you.", "Definitely seems a bit premature for her to be on a family holiday then. Have you spoken to your parents? It seems like Claire expects you and her to look after both kids which doesn\u2019t seem like a holiday.", "Ok. That's very weird then. \n\nNTA", "Apparently", "Good luck to her on that \ud83d\ude02", "This is probably the most benign read of the situation which is also plausible", "He\u2019s not incompetent?", "They\u2019ve been together two years, Claire has been around the family a lot, it doesn\u2019t feel premature. Charles just doesn\u2019t want to live together and I suppose neither does Claire but they\u2019re in a stable relationship. \n\nMy parents say if I don\u2019t want to look after Ruby then I shouldn\u2019t. But my mum does feel really sorry for Claire which I do too In some ways. \n\nI\u2019m fine looking after my child on holiday that\u2019s why I bring her on holiday haha. But obviously Claire was looking forward to a break which she is now not getting", ">Oh, yeah they\u2019re not married nor do they live together. Charles isn\u2019t really big on kids (I\u2019m not either tbh besides my daughter) so I don\u2019t see him doing too much solo babysitting.\n\nI was thinking about his inability to solo babysit long enough to give his partner some relief.", "It\u2019s for your brother to help out. Not you. And if your parents want to give Claire a break they can look after Ruby. \n\nI don\u2019t think two years is premature but that your brother won\u2019t look after Ruby but expects you to is weird. He\u2019s in a long term relationship with a mum and isn\u2019t taking on any childcare responsibilities but expects his family to?", "I very much doubt it\u2019s an inability, he probably just doesn\u2019t want to. But I don\u2019t think she asked him on this occasion, I think she wanted to spend time with him so him babysitting wouldn\u2019t help that", "Ngl I get what he\u2019s doing. He just wants Claire to get what she wants. Which I understand but yeah it\u2019s easy for him to say when he doesn\u2019t have to do the babysitting \ud83d\ude44", "Perhaps *character flaw* would be a better term."]}
