I also have a (36m) bf who we will call Kyle.\n\nKyle and I have been dating for two months, and things have been going smoothly.\n\nNina loves animals. She wanted a kitten, but I thought it would be too much work for a girl her age, and we got her a ferret for her birthday instead. She was ecstatic and keeps him in a crate at night and takes him out to play through-out the day. She named him Peanut-Butter and it was so adorable (he was a white ferret with some caramel coloring so he really did look like he was dipped in peanutbuter!).\n\nOkay so here's the problem. Kyle hates ferrets and weasels and pretty much most small animals. When he first started coming over, he was hesitant to even go in Nina's room knowing Peanut-Butter was there. He still tried his best though, despite his phobia.\n\nI told Nina to stay in her room because Kyle was coming over and I wanted to spend time with him. She argued with me because she said she wanted to play with Kyle too. I told her no, it was getting late (it was already 6:30) and he was probably too tired to play and just wanted to relax. She agreed.\n\nI was in my room watching TV, when I hear screaming and then crying coming from the living room. I run to the living room, and Kyle is freaking out, and Nina is trying to run outside past him.\n\nI yell at her and ask what the actual hell is going on, and Kyle tells me he opened the door, and Nina answered, and put Peanut-Butter on him. He freaked out, grabbed Peanut-Butter, and threw him off of him, and he landed on the steps outside. Peanut-Butter supposedly started running away, and Nina wanted to chase after him.\n\nI was livid. She knew I had a hard day and wanted to spend time with Kyle, and she used his fears against him. He didn't even wanted stay over after that. So now she lost her pet. and I lost my night with him.\n\nI grounded Nina for not listening to me, and she cried. She's been in her room all day grieving her pet, but if she hadn't put Kyle and Peanut-Butter in an unsafe situation, this wouldn't have happened.\n\nWhen Nina went to her dad's house, Nina told him what happened and he yelled at me over the phone, saying she's heartbroken and told me to have a heart.\n\nI don't know what to say though. It was the consequences of her own actions imo.

Holy crap. You\u2019re locking your 7yo daughter in her room so you can \u201chave quality time\u201d with your brand new boyfriend?? That\u2019s way worse to me than your complete lack of common sense in getting your daughter a ferret. I hope your kid\u2019s dad gets full-time custody because you\u2019re going to do your daughter some real harm. Do you even like her?", "YTA, if you don't want a child let her stay at her fathers. \nSecondly, your BF has no business, knowing your daughter after two months. Third, you are not able to take care of a child or pet. \nGuess what, 7 year old children forgett things. And you should have been to open the door. Not your child.", "YTA in so many ways I am losing count! You daughter is 7 & shouldn\u2019t be answering the door at all, she shouldn\u2019t be expected to stay on her room while you have a date, she is your CHILD not your roommate. Her pet escaped & you didn\u2019t even look for it?? WTF is wrong with you? You are more worried about not shacking up than the safe being of a live animal!", "Good job OP. You've managed to spin a story where you traumatized your daughter into a \"woe is me\" piece. \n\n**SHE'S 7!** She just lost her pet and is obviously distraught but you're more concerned that you couldn't spend time with your boyfriend?! \n\nYou try to blame her for putting the ferret on him but you've only known this guy or 2 months why the hell is your 7 year old daughter even the one answering the door when you knew he was coming over?! Not to mention if his phobia is that extreme why is he even coming to your house in the first place, when (once again) you've only been dating for 2 months?!\n\nOP there is absolutely no redeeming aspect to this, YTA here.", "YTA.  You seem to care more about Kyle than your daughter.  First, I'm side-eyeing the fact that you've only been dating 2 months, and you already introduced him to your kid?  Also, you thought a ferret would be less work than a cat?  Ferrets are a TON of work, if you taking good care of them.  Next, you banish your daughter to her room so that you can spend time with your boyfriend.  Then, you yell at her for acting like a typical 7 year old.  Kids that age aren't known for seeing their actions all the way through to the potential consequences.  And her losing her pet is way worse than you losing your night with your boyfriend.  So YTA for being a pretty bad parent.", "YTA.\nA cat is not more work than a ferret and maybe you should date someone who isn\u2019t terrified of the one you got your daughter. \nAnd then to be more upset about your date than your daughters grief? Definitely YTA", "YTA, my GOD YTA.\n\nYou informed your daughter that she is no better than a bad smell and should hide away in her room, while making quite certain that she knows well and good that your boyfriend of two months takes priority over her. \n\nAnd now, she is also very painfully aware that your boyfriend's immature and irrational behavior of THROWING A LIVING THING - a beloved pet - outside and down some steps is a perfectly appropriate response to what in her mind was a small prank. Instead of helping her find her beloved pet, you blamed her for your boyfriend's response, and accused a SEVEN YEAR OLD of doing something vindictive and calculated against him. What the actual fuck, lady?", "YTA you're putting a 7 yo in bed at 630 for some dick. Get it together", "YTA. I can't figure out if there were any adults in the post, because it certainly didn't seem like it.\n\n I'll echo your lack of parenting skills as well. Locking up your kid at dinner time so you can hang out with your boyfriend of 2 months?!?! Most mature parents don't even consider bringing their significant other around the kids until the relationship is real and established.  I'd recommend you reassess your priorities, because as you showed us, they're a mess.  Plus, an innocent animal is likely dead because of your atrocious decision making abilities.", "YTA - please tell me where around where you live so myself or my other ferret loving people can go find that poor baby.", "so you decided to ignore your 7YO daughter to hang out with your boyfriend of 2 months? and getting her a ferret instead of a cat doesn\u2019t make sense because ferrets require more care. YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou've been dating a guy 2 months and he's already around your house with your 7 year old daughter, who you tell to stay in her room so you can have quality time?\n\nHoly crap, lady.", "YTA - to literally everyone else in this story.\n\nYou're a shitty parent for locking your kid in her room so you could hang with your boyfriend AND for thinking a ferret was less work than a kitten.\n\nYou're a shitty SO for not getting a babysitter and having your date elsewhere.\n\nYou're a shitty pet owner for not immediately helping your kid look for the ferret. ETA that you're also a shitty person for thinking that a book for kids is adequate research for taking care of a pet for life. \n\nAlso, you're a shitty PERSON for how you wrote all of this story and tried to make yourself feel better.", "YTA. \n\nFor so many reasons.", "YTA. Way to make your daughter feel like she's not important. Way to go, Mom.", "Yta, you shouldn't even be letting a man you've been dating for 2 months around your daughter. From your comments you sound like a pretty crappy mum and your daughter would be better off living with her dad.", "You introduced your daughter after only dating for 2 months..? Please tell me you\u2019ve known him longer than 2 months.", "YTA!!!! Woo big AH, for one your daughter is 7, she acted like a 7 year old. But more importantly you\u2019re letting a man you barely started to date meet your daughter come into your house with her there and from the sounds of it would let him go into your daughters room alone with her if she wasn\u2019t scared of the ferret. I hate to break it but that\u2019s how SA happens", "YTA. Please let this be fake. That poor little animal and your poor daughter. All so you could get laid? Freaking gross", "YTA for acting like your daughter is a roommate\u2026 you told your own daughter to leave you alone and stay in her room so you could have bf time. Lady\u2026. That\u2019s wrong.", "YTA- you gave your SEVEN year old a FERRET when a CAT would be \"too much\"?! Play stupid games win stupid prizes I guess, it's just unfortunate an animal had to suffer because of your ignorance and poor handling of the situation. Your boyfriend is an adult and should have been more in control of himself, and you're an AH for putting quality time with your boyfriend of only two freaking months over your child and YOUR pet's safety (yes! It's your freaking pet! You are the adult who purchased it!!!)", "YTA. Your daughter is 7 and should not be shuffled off to another room for a new boyfriend. \n\nPlus, ferrets are way more work than a kitten. More research should be done before selecting your next pet. \n\nThink carefully before introducing your daughter to new boyfriends. It's probably best to wait until you are seriously comsidering marriage before introducing them, and reassure your daughter constantly of your love for her.", "YTA!\n\n1. Ferrets are definitely more work than kittens.\n2. Your bf of 2 months shouldn't be meeting your kid yet and definitely SHOULD be hesitant about going in her room!\n3. You can't just crate your 7 year old because you want to pretend to be a carefree college kid on date night.", "YTA for getting a 7 y/o a ferret. Like dude if she isn\u2019t mature enough for a cat why on earth would you get a ferret?", "YTA just for the \u201cand I lost my night with him\u201d comment. Ferrets are far more difficult than cats btw.", "YTA for prioritising your bf over your daughter.\nFirstly you shut her in her room for the night so you could hang out with your bf.\nThen her pet got out, and instead of helping her go and find him you got angry and grounded her.\nSure it\u2019s partially her fault that her pet got out but she\u2019s 7.", "Yta you have been dating two months. He shouldn't be  meeting Nina if she is you priority", "YTA for so many reasons, you are angry because you didn\u2019t get some action in your hard hard day??? She\u2019s 7, you are the adult, also how is a ferret less work that a cat? You can\u2019t even make some research beforehand????", "What the fuck is wrong with you?", "Congratulations. You have:\n\n1) traumatized your daughter by causing her to lose her pet whom she is very close to \n2) taught your daughter that she doesn't matter and your various boyfriends are more important than her \n3) left an innocent DOMESTICATED animal to be ripped apart by predators. It is DOMESTICATED. It will not be \"fine\" as you said in one comment. \n4) permanently damaged your relationship with her\n\nThere are MANY other ways to punish her than letting her pet be k*lled. Do your best to find the ferret, apologize to your daughter, and then have a conversation about respecting boundaries in an age-appropriate way.\n\nYTA YTA YTA", "YTA \n\nI feel so sorry for your daughter. It's very clear what your priorities are, it's a shame your daughter isn't one. You expected a seven year old to stay in her room all evening and night, so you could spend time with your boyfriend? Do you not see the problem with that? \n\n So now she lost her pet. and I lost my night with him\n\nDo you think these two things are somehow equivalent? Your daughter lost a pet she clearly loved and adored, you missed out on a single night with what could be a temporary partner anyway. Have some empathy. Your daughter might only be a child, but she is still a human being with FEELINGS. She's a little girl who made a mistake, I think the loss of her pet was enough. Do you expect your child to bend to your will her whole life?", "YTA. First your daughter is 7.  In her world the only people with fears are kids, adults are fearless.  So expecting a 7 year old to truly understand phobias is expecting too much.\n\nBut the real reasons YTA are you clearly didn't research ferrets. They are a lot more work than cats not less if properly cared for.  And the worst part is banishing your kid to her room because you wanted time alone with your bf?  It is her home and she hadn't done anything wrong at the time you banished her.  Wait until shes in bed or get a babysitter when you want time alone with him.  Why are you even introducing him to your kid after only a couple of months?\n\nEdit: sp", "YTA.  While it wasn\u2019t her best move to put her ferret on your BF, him throwing it outside is not acceptable.  Did you help to look for her pet or just yell at her for upsetting your squeeze?  Your child should ALWAYS be your main priority and you put someone else before her.  Shame on you.", "YTA you're an awful person and mother.. feel terrible for your daughter ...sounds like she has a good dad tho!", " You are a selfish ass.", "You gave your 7 year old an exotic pet when you thought a CAT was too much?\n\nYou're definitely an asshole.", "YTA. Your daughter has lost her pet. The pet you decided on because you thought a kitten was too much for her. You lost one night with your boyfriend. Once again she\u2019s 7, a little girl. You essentially punished her because of your boyfriend\u2019s phobia. Did you know about his phobia before you bought the ferret? Does your daughter even understand his phobia?", "YTA\n\n\u201cShe knew I had a hard day and wanted to spend it with Kyle, and she used his fears against him.\u201d \n\nYou\u2019re overestimating the maturity of your 7 year old, and you sound more like an older sister than a mom. Grow up. \n\nShe didn\u2019t want to be alone, clearly. You can\u2019t hide her away when you don\u2019t feel like being a parent. She is 7, not your room mate. She doesn\u2019t understand \u201cmommy had a rough day and wants to be with someone other than me.\u201d That\u2019s messed up.\n\nAnd she didn\u2019t use Kyle\u2019s fears against him, either. She probably just doesn\u2019t understand how she can like Kyle and she can like peanut butter, so she thinks maybe he just needs to give peanut butter a chance. 7 year olds are NOT that smart. They make many bad decisions, but that shouldn\u2019t turn into a snowball of pain because you\u2019re selfish. \n\nYOU should have helped her look for the ferret. That\u2019s a living being out there. This will traumatize her, and you just forced her to be stuck in her room alone AGAIN instead of allowing her to look for her pet. So she\u2019s just sitting there wondering where peanut butter is\u2026 while you pout about Kyle. \n\nI feel sorry for your daughter. I hope her dad sees your post and the whole story about your selfishness and your own immaturity\n\nLastly, it is pretty gross to have a brand new partner around your kid in her home. Please consider how many relationships people go through in their lifetime, especially the short relationships that don\u2019t last. Now imagine your daughter meeting them all because you thought this one was different, that one was different, this was me is the one, no THIS one is the one. Don\u2019t do that to her. Take it slow, keep her separate from new people for a while. \n\n.", " YTA on many counts. \n\nFirst of all, a ferret is much higher maintenance than a cat. I\u2019ve had both of them. And kids. \n\nSecond, you seriously asked your 7 years old daughter to spend the whole evening in her room so you could cuddle your boyfriend? WTF is wrong with you? \n\nThird: she is 7. She is 7. She likely can\u2019t regulate her emotions well right now. \n\nYou have put way to much burden on your daughter, and made her feel like she is the burden.", "Tbh I feel like YTA just for the poor judgement that somehow a ferret is less work than a kitten. Cats are pretty famously very independent animals. Give them food, water, some cat toys, a litter tray and they\u2019re basically fine (I\u2019m not suggesting that there aren\u2019t other factors to consider- I\u2019m just giving the basics).\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to leave the safeguarding of an adults phobias in the hands of a 7 year old. I can\u2019t tell if you were with Kyle before or after you got the ferret, but ultimately this is a situation YOU created and you need to take responsibility for that.", "Did you even look for the poor ferret? YTA YTA YTA.", "YTA\nA 6 year old isn't old enough for sole responsibility of a pet, silly. The dynamic with the boyfriend is weird af too.", "you\u2019re a terrible mother. you want to be with that man SOOO BAD. you\u2019re neglecting your child just to do it ? why\u2019d you even have a kid ?", "YTA from the beginning. In what universe are ferrets less work than cats? You got your daughter a pet that you wanted. You also picked an animal your bf wasn't okay with. Then you got mad at a seven year old girl for acting like a seven year old girl. You need to do a lot of work on self awareness, and probably need professional help with that.", "YTA  so unfortunate you missed your night with your new boyfriend. (Sarcasm)", "YTA it\u2019s your child\u2019s home and you allowed her the pet. She\u2019s 7. Kids can have empathy but do you really think she fully understands your hard day and your need to hang out with your boyfriend instead of her?", "Your child is 7. You\u2019ve only been with this dude for 2 months. Why are you prioritizing him over her in her own home? YTA.", "YTA. Stop prioritizing a partner over your child.\nAlso 7 year olds do not have pets.\n\nAnd you now killed that animal.\nGrow up, and do the world a favor, never own another animal.", "YTA big time. Did you just abandon the ferret to the wild? How is it going to survive? Or did the fall kill it? I am horrified.", "YTA major major YTA\n\nFirst the obvious WTF - why would you get a 7-year old a ferret if they aren\u2019t ready for a kitten. Let\u2019s see, buy my daughter a half feral weasel or a domesticated cat? Hmmm \ud83e\udd14 \n\nI just can\u2019t\u2026 OMG. Caring for a ferret is far more difficult than  caring for a cat. And now you\u2019ve illegally released a weasel into your local ecosystem. At least a cat probably knows enough to come home when it\u2019s hungry and *isn\u2019t illegal to let outside*\n\nNext - your kid is 7 and apparently you think she needs to be more responsible than your 36-year-old BF. If you want alone time with Kyle and he\u2019s afraid of pets, spend it in your room. Or outside the house. Or tell him to man up and grow a pair already. \n\nNope, you decide to make your 7-year old the responsible adult. \n\nWell congratulations, this one broke my brain. I have just lost all hope in people being responsible parents.", "YTA - ferrets are harder work than dogs and cats WTF!!!! ALSO your daughter just lost her pet and you grounded her??? She's a kid, keep a better eye on your child", "YTA.\n\nShe's a 7 year old child who loves her pet dearly and likely doesn't truly understand why other people wouldn't also love her pet.\n\nYou're a 29 year old mother who has already introduced her 7 year old child to a boyfriend of only two months (hope you're saving up for those therapy bills after she has trouble forming healthy attachments) and having him stay overnight and are punishing your kid because you didn't get to bone your boyfriend.\n\nIt's not even a contest who is the TA in this situation.", "She's 7\nCan i say again She's 7!\nShe wasn't being spiteful. she was excited about a pet she loves and doesn\u2019t understand that people can be scared of animals. \nAlso, you told she was to stay in her room while your boyfriend was over. She's not a toy you put away when you have other things to do\nYTA and this memory will NEVER go away", "YTA--your child is SEVEN YEARS OLD. That's old enough for rules and consequences, but it's definitely not old enough to always calibrate those correctly. You should have helped her find her pet, then given her a very long talk about how scaring people isn't funny. Instead you got angry that your date night was interrupted by your kid, who you previously intended to leave confined to her room all night. You also let down your responsibility to Peanut Butter; a seven year old cannot care for a pet alone, so that made his health and welfare your duty as well as hers. \n\nIf Kyle has any sense, his departure didn't have as much to do with the ferret as it had to do with your actions.", "YTA. You\u2019re a terrible parent, and an animal may be dead because of your idiot boyfriend. Both of you are toxic jerks.", "YTA.  You have a 7 year old who acted like a 7 year old.

I don\u2019t even know where to start. You are fucking horrible. For so many reasons. Just awful. \n\nYTA", "YTA, and honestly, kind of a terrible mother in this scenario.\n\nYour daughter is **seven years old.** Your boyfriend is presumably **a fully grown adult.** You told your incredibly young child to stay in her room so you could spend time with your boyfriend alone. Your child just wanted to have time with both you and your boyfriend, and you instead wanted her to lock herself up in a room so you could ignore her. That's shitty parenting decision #1 here.\n\nThen, when your fully-grown boyfriend threw your daughter's pet, which could have severely injured or even killed that pet, you scolded your daughter instead of helping her go look for her (likely severely injured) pet. Why? **Because she interrupted your fucking date night.** That's shitty parenting decision #2-100.\n\nWhat - and I cannot stress this enough - the fuck were you thinking?\n\nYour daughter deserves better. At least her father gives a shit about her, because you clearly don't.", "YTA\u2014You\u2019re prioritizing some dude that you\u2019ve been banging for 2 months over your SEVEN YEAR OLD CHILD! \n\nMy heart is breaking for your precious daughter. Your child shouldn\u2019t ever have to give one single thought to her mum getting some action. This is so disgusting. \n\nBTW, why would Kyle ever go into your child\u2019s room? Why is that even an option?", "YTA and in my opinion, hugely  so. \n\n1. Ferrets are way more work than kittens. How could you not know this?\n\n2. You basically SHUT YOUR DAUGHTER IN HER ROOM so you could have a booty call with your boyfriend. Stellar parenting right there. \n\n3. At the advanced hour of 6:30, you left your seven year old to her own devices so you could rest up before said booty call. Kyle, after two months, apparently has a key to your place and came in. At which point the seven year old acted like a seven year old and showed him her pet. Kyle over reacted and screamed and THREW your daughter\u2019s pet to the floor. Animal abuser much?\n\n4. Instead of giving a crap about a helpless animal, or your daughter, you, annoyed at the \u201cruin\u201d of your booty call, punished your daughter for \u201cputting Kyle in an unsafe situation.\u201d What, bc the might have gotten ferret cooties?\n\nI\u2019m just\u2026 sheesh, lady. Parent of the year you are not.", " YTA You knew your daughter wanted to spend time with you both. You knew Kyle was afraid of ferrets and you let a 7yr old open the front door unsupervised.

Jeez", " YTA- you need to get your head on straight. Your daughter should be your number one priority not your sex thing of 2 months. And how dumb are you to think that a ferret is easier than a cat? Cats are independent unlike ferrets. Plus giving your 7 year old the cold shoulder is ridiculous! That\u2019s emotional abuse because she doesn\u2019t understand why.

You buy your child a ferret instead of a cat, with no research, because it's smaller so it must be easier (ferrets are \\*NOT\\* less work than cats) ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jrd3h/comment/j5m57sp/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))\n2. You take absolutely no responsibility for the living animal you purchased and brought into your home - deciding to abandon it to the wilderness and refuse to let ANYONE bring it back in to teach your daughter a lesson. ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jrd3h/comment/j5m5uwl/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3))\n3. You think that Ferrets can survive in the wild because they're [related to weasels](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jrd3h/comment/j5m8xpo/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), and [reiterate](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jrd3h/comment/j5m9qd5/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that there are [WILD](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jrd3h/comment/j5maqq7/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Ferrets, so it will do just fine.  \nNote - dogs are related to wolves - so can you abandon your puppy on the side of the road to suffer because they \"can survive\"? It's OK to leave your de-clawed indoor housecat in the woods because, well, it's related to a bobcat, so it should be fine? Should you let a turtle get out and go where it pleases, because there are wild turtles? (Spoiler --> answer is \\*NO\\*)\n4. You don't want to take responsibility for parenting. \"[Parents shouldn't have to be with their kids 24/7](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jrd3h/comment/j5m5oo4/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\" - perhaps not - but you should take more ownership and responsibility for parenting!\n5.

I also have a (36m) bf who we will call Kyle.\n\nKyle and I have been dating for two months, and things have been going smoothly.\n\nNina loves animals. She wanted a kitten, but I thought it would be too much work for a girl her age, and we got her a ferret for her birthday instead. She was ecstatic and keeps him in a crate at night and takes him out to play through-out the day. She named him Peanut-Butter and it was so adorable (he was a white ferret with some caramel coloring so he really did look like he was dipped in peanutbuter!).\n\nOkay so here's the problem. Kyle hates ferrets and weasels and pretty much most small animals. When he first started coming over, he was hesitant to even go in Nina's room knowing Peanut-Butter was there. He still tried his best though, despite his phobia.\n\nI told Nina to stay in her room because Kyle was coming over and I wanted to spend time with him. She argued with me because she said she wanted to play with Kyle too. I told her no, it was getting late (it was already 6:30) and he was probably too tired to play and just wanted to relax. She agreed.\n\nI was in my room watching TV, when I hear screaming and then crying coming from the living room. I run to the living room, and Kyle is freaking out, and Nina is trying to run outside past him.\n\nI yell at her and ask what the actual hell is going on, and Kyle tells me he opened the door, and Nina answered, and put Peanut-Butter on him. He freaked out, grabbed Peanut-Butter, and threw him off of him, and he landed on the steps outside. Peanut-Butter supposedly started running away, and Nina wanted to chase after him.\n\nI was livid. She knew I had a hard day and wanted to spend time with Kyle, and she used his fears against him. He didn't even wanted stay over after that. So now she lost her pet. and I lost my night with him.\n\nI grounded Nina for not listening to me, and she cried. She's been in her room all day grieving her pet, but if she hadn't put Kyle and Peanut-Butter in an unsafe situation, this wouldn't have happened.\n\nWhen Nina went to her dad's house, Nina told him what happened and he yelled at me over the phone, saying she's heartbroken and told me to have a heart.\n\nI don't know what to say though. It was the consequences of her own actions imo. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
