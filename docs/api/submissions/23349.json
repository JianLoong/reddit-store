I have some health issues that could easily kill me if I stayed in that level of heat for 20 minutes. Especially without ice packs/ice water.\n\nThat he didn't warn you or Immediately let you out is concerning. I agree you should report his behavior to the safety line.\n\nI'd also leave a review saying no AC, as a warning to other people using Uber.", "Definitely NTA - I don't do well in hot temperatures either and being stuck in a hot car with no AC? I'm not doing it.", "And op is just trying to live, literally", "I just heard that around 14 prisons in Texas don't have AC. And a bunch more that are only partially air-conditioned. It's unconscionable.", "Hell, I'm in the Midwest and the heat index was 105 today. We had heat warnings saying not to go outside unless absolutely necessary, to stay in AIR-CONDITIONED spaces. If you didn't have air-conditioning you should go to community cooling.\n\nMy husband's job just hired a new recruit and she's going through training right now. A couple of days ago she and the other members in her class were doing physically demanding training and she had to be taken to the hospital for heat exhaustion. The training was being done INSIDE in a space with air-conditioning. The current temps are no joke.", "Just blocked that guy for saying that being sick and dying are two different things. As if we don\u2019t know that? It\u2019s still serious as hell, and not someone should have to deal with. I hate people sometimes!", "Oh what the fuck? \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, bro! It\u2019s all good!\u201d \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Did you miss the part about \"get it fixed\"? The point is that all eligible cars have AC installed, working or not.", "Midwesterner here. Heat index today was 115degrees. \n\nIt took a whopping 10 minutes for me to start dehydrating, feeling dizzy and nauseous. \n\nThis heat IS dangerous, and a 20minute ride in a hot ass car CAN cause heat exhaustion. \n\nSome people are extremely sensitive to heat.", "A new hire at my husband's work was doing training inside, in an AIR-CONDITIONED space, and had to be taken to the hospital with heat exhaustion.", "I think we\u2019ve found the Uber driver.", "With increasing wealth inequality, there'll always be new poor to exploit.  And I guess I should have acknowledged that they don't want to kill *all* the poor -- they need some for legal slave labor in prisons, after all.", "Go look at some pictures of 3rd degree burns and then be so fucking cavalier.", "Plus the air being so crap because of the Canadian wildfires.", "I have a 32-year-old \u201cfun car\u201d and even THAT takes maybe 5 mins tops to cool down. It\u2019s also been close to 100 here lately and I cannot imagine driving around without the AC on.", "I have tachycardia and it's worse in heat. No AC no ride. I would rather not pass out in a stranger's car thanks", "NTA.", "Today I took an Uber specifically because my ac is out in my car, and it's summer in Texas. I would have died if the Uber had shown up with no ac.\n\nNTA.", "NTA an uber better have working brakes, a seat belt and AC.", "It's not kidnapping, it's false imprisonment, which is far lesser of a crime..", "NPR literally had a story this morning about how exactly this is happening right now. Heat stroke can get dangerous fast, especially in areas that aren't used to or prepared for this heat. \n\nIt's not hyperbole. It's really happening.", "Oh my goodness! Wow!", "My meds make me sensitive to the heat.  I can get very sick, very fast.\nNTA OP.", "That would require the company to pay for something, cutting into profits they, after all these years, still don't actually have.", "Dehydration sucks: sometimes you can suffer its effects without realizing that you're dehydrated. \n\nScariest moment of my life was when I was practicing parkour by myself in a park during summer. Without warning, my vision started to go wonky and I felt nauseous. Barely managed to make it to a shaded area with a seat. Didn't realize until I relayed this story to a friend of mine that I was just dehydrated.", "Won't someone think of the shareholders?", "Oh I know!  This happened to me once with heatstroke and I agree, the scariness was that I couldn\u2019t process what was happening.  I couldn\u2019t think or stop myself from walking in circles or figure out how to get to the parking lot.  Some kind man saw me and said, \u201cyou are not okay right now, I\u2019m going to help you.\u201d\n\nMy doc said this is bc the brain functions go first \ud83d\ude33.  How terrifying is that?", "Exactly, plus it can get very hot inside cars with the windows rolled up. Very dangerous! The stupidity is astounding.", "\"I drew in 55 it's all good\"", "I'm also pregnant, and my city rarely has air conditioned busses. Even with all the windows open, when it's 30C out the bus was more like 35C, I had to get off and walk because with the breeze that was preferable to passing out/throwing up on the bus. Heat can be KILLER if you have extra sensitivity.\n\nAnd even if you don't!", "No ac is an automatic disqualifier for working with Uber. If he is reported that will suspend his account until he can prove that it is fixed. NTA.", "You have the right to exit someone\u2019s vehicle for whatever reason you choose. Depending on Uber policy, he might be within his rights to still charge you the fare, but he does not ever have the right to keep you from exiting the car.", "NTA. He has the option of only delivering food, if his car isn't fit for passengers. And his behavior is NOT okay. He refused to let you out, called you names and is lying to Uber about the condition of his vehicle. You get to decide which cars you will ride in, and you get to leave feedback, so the next rider who *doesn't* have the guts to argue him down isn't stuck in a rolling oven until he decides the ride is over. Report him and his behavior to Uber, and leave him an honest review.", "NTA. \n\nI was an Uber driver, in a southern very hot state. If my AC was out, I would not have been driving. That said, he's not an AH for trying to make a living-- he's an AH for initially refusing to pull over. That's... literally a crime.", "Nope...NTA.", "NTA\n\nAC is required in this sort of heat. No way I would pay for a 20 minute torture ride.", "I'm so sorry.  That's so sad.", "Also op was going to a work function. \n\nWho wants to go somewhere and be sweaty and uncomfortable?! Especially a work event.\n\nNTA op", "As someone who lived in Texas with a black car and ALWAYS had to park in the sun at my apartment and work, it did not ever take more than five minutes for my oldish not great car to cool off even when the internal temperature in the car reached upwards of 110 degrees, so idk what\u2019s wrong with your car but there must be something because that\u2019s not the normal experience lmao"]}
