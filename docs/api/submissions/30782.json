I'm not from the US, I'm attended uni for free and had a scholarship which took care of my housing/food situation. The country I'm from has really good deals for student dorms and I was able to stay at a dorm for the entirety of my studies. I don't own a car either as I work from home (this will be important later). I landed a stable job righr after uni and I'm attending what you in the US call grad school.  My parents weren't really supportive during my studies, they expressed zero interest in attending my graduation or conferences where I presented my work. \n\nYesterday, I visited my uncle (M43). He took his children to Paris for a holiday and they had a blast, so I went over to see the photos, videos, hear how it was etc. My cousin (f8) asked if I've ever been to Paris, I told her no, but it is on my list. She asked me why I never went to Paris and I told her I never had the opportunity. Now, my uni friend (m24) was in Paris at the same time as my uncle and cousins and they met by chance in a restaurant. My uncle knows my friend (my uncle is an interior designer and he designed my friend's mum's house after I introduced them) and my uncle mentioned they saw him in Paris. I remembered he was gifted a trip to Paris and London as a graduation gift from his parents and my uncle mentioned that my friend told him so.\n\n I remembered my friend telling me about that holiday and I verified to my uncle that was probably his graduation present and then my cousin asked what I got as a graduation present. As you all probably have guessed by now, I got nothing. I'm absolutely not entitled to anything, but for context, my younger sister (f19)got into uni this year and my parents gifter her roughly $900 worth of gifts including shoes and jewellery. I told my cousin I got myself a pair of shoes I really wanted for graduation and from my first real paycheck and my boyfriend gifted me a notebook. My cousin looked really sad and told me that's really not enough for something as big as a graduation. My uncle looked really upset too and I just switched over to another topic.\n\nThis morning, I got an angry call from my mother. She called me an ungrateful brat for demanding a gift for doing what was required of me to do and asked if I want a participation trophy. She also mentioned my uncle suggested they buy me a car (something I never wished for or expressed wanting) and said if I want a car, I should work for it, a sentiment I agree with. I just hung up because I didn't have it in me to deal with her. Btw, English is not my first language, sorry for any mistakes. \n\nSo reddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1699732235, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17t28re/aitah_for_telling_my_cousin_i_didnt_get_a/", "score": 554, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Doesn't sound like OP expressly said \"my parents didn't attend my graduation or get me anything,\" just that she'd gotten something for herself and her boyfriend got her something.

However, I didn't get a single gift when entering uni. If you need more context, the course I got in has a very low acceptance rate, whereas hers has a high one and anyone can get in as long as they attended high school.

I'll tell him he's well liked on reddit", "Nah, I disagree. You can tell by the way she wrote her post that she is conscious of the injustice of the situation, and that her parents disregard her. She makes no excuses for them, and doesn't disparage herself. She is very aware of her own accomplishments (she got into a low acceptance program, she speaks at conferences etc) and doesn't  minimize them. She does seem to have learned to live with her parents' disinterest in her in what strikes me as a very healthy way. \n\nMy impression was definitely not that she doesn't think she's worthy of anything. To me, she read as someone who focuses on personal agency and achievement and is not seeking external validation. I mean, it would have been very easy for her to answer the question in a way intended to illicit sympathy and outrage, and it doesn't seem like that's what she did. She could also have answered in a more self deprecating way, like \"Oh it's ok, it was no big deal really\" etc, and she didn't do that either. There is a difference between not thinking you're worthy, and not needing inputs from another person to feel worth. \n\nHer parents, on the other hand... Based on the accusations her mother hurled at her, assuming the kinds of things she must have said to Uncle -- She's *demanding* a car etc -- very clearly have their own ideas about the kind of person she is. Seems to me they're the ones who don't think she's worthy of anything.", "Yep, mum wants to carry on favouring one child in peace.", "Thank you so much everyone!

AT this point, you are well on your way to a successful life, and I hate to say it but you may have to just accept this is who your parents are, and stop expecting them to care/show up.  It sounds awful...but the biggest thing is to make sure YOU'VE handled things the way you want.  If you want them to hear something from you, say it. If they're unhappy with you, listen and stand up for yourself. It sucks ...and I'm sorry.  I wish you the best of luck", "Thank you for your kind words. I'm very lonely and my childhood wasn't really happy. My parents are/were negligent/distant. I used to say they didn't know better but I have to learn to stop giving them excuses.
