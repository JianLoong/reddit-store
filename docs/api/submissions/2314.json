I live on a limited income though so I never am really able to give her food or money. \n\nI recently gave her a bags of food from my own freezer and fridge. It wasn\u2019t gourmet but it was essentials such as hot dogs, cheese, eggs, canned goods etc. \nShe approached me shortly after dropping off the food and told me she \u201cthrew out all the food\u201d because I should have \u201casked what she wanted\u201d and I shouldn\u2019t assume she and her kids would eat things like hot dogs. \nI was so taken aback that I literally flipped out, told her that it was incredibly wrong that she threw out multiple bags of food and she was being ungreatful. I told her to never ask me for anything ever again.\nI did flip out pretty bad but I was just shocked that she was okay with throwing out so much food. I easily gave her $100 worth of food. \nAm I the asshole for flipping out?

She really needs to learn the expression beggars cannot be choosers.", "I think what did it for me was the fact that I\u2019ve struggled most of my life money and food wise and I couldn\u2019t wrap my head around someone just throwing food out. It wasn\u2019t like it was expired or spoiled. I told her in the very least she could have dropped it at the local food bank which isn\u2019t far from her house.", "No, obviously NTA. I bet if you had asked her what she wanted, she would have been requesting steak n' shit.", "NTA. That is definitely something to flip out about. She could have easily given you the food back if it wasn't good enough for her to eat.", "NTA.  Wow, how ungrateful can you get...If she and her children are truly that hungry, they would have eaten the food you provided.  It's not like you gave them off the wall stuff that normal people don't eat, you essentially gave them staples.  The least she could have done was given it back if she didn't want what you gave her.  She threw your money in the garbage.  I definitely would not try to help them again.", "NTA. She defines \u201cungrateful\u201d. I wouldn\u2019t bother helping her again, either.", "The *slightest* excuse for this would be if she or her kids had food allergies, and even then, just chucking out the food instead of bringing it back is completely unjustified. If they aren\u2019t allergic, she just screwed over her kids by prolonging their hunger. NTA. Wtf.", "NTA dont do anything for that person again. If anything, take out her children and feed them your self even thats a stretch", "The phrase \"Beggars can't be choosers\" comes to mind. \n\nNTA. She could have looked at what you brought and sent whatever she didn't want back with you, or to you. She didn't have to just throw it away and then *complain* about it afterwards.\n\nThe bare minimum decent thing to do would be to thank you for the thoughtfulness, mention what kind of foods her family typically prefers in case you feel generous again, and just not say anything about throwing it away.\n\nWhat an ungrateful asshole.", "NTA, she could\u2019ve offered the food back to you instead, and she acted entitled when you did her a kindness. If she and her kids are that hungry and struggling you don\u2019t throw out food.", "NTA. What she did was absolutely disgusting. I don\u2019t blame you at all for \u2018flipping out\u2019 - you tried to do something kind and selfless, and any normal person in her position would be very, very grateful to you. If she really did have a problem with something in the bags (allergies and the like), she could at least have let you keep it or donated it to a food bank. Awful how she would just toss perfectly good food in the bin when millions upon millions are starving.", "NTA\n\nIf she really didn't want your food, then she shouldn't have took it: throwing it away was wrong.", "NTA - that was incredibly disrespectful.", "NTA. Beggars can\u2019t be choosers. Also who the fuck perfectly good throws food away when they\u2019re hungry. At least give the food back.", "NTA. Did she ask you for food or did you just bring some over? Even if she didn't ask I don't know why she'd throw it away instead of just giving it back to you.", "NTA. Throwing perfectly good food out is terrible behavior. TBH I wouldn't eat those things either but I would have given them back to you or found someone who needed it.", "NTA choosing beggers. That's not ok. Never help her out again. Go low contact", "NTA. Your relative is what is known as a choosy beggar. I had a mooch of a brother like that. In addition to him being an addict, lived with our mom. When got sick and had to go into the hospital, he didnt have anyone to spend $40 per day on pop, chips, snack cakes, and junk food. He is a 38 year old man who fully knows how to cook. Her kitchen was bursting with good food. A freezer full of meat. Pantry full of canned goods, potatoes, dry goods. Icebox with milk, eggs, butter, cheese, deli meat.....anything you could possibly want.\n\nHe told everyone who would listen that I was \"starving\" him because I couldnt afford his junk food and pop habit while paying my bills AND moms bills. One of our aunts took pity and bought him $80 worth of junk food, including 4, 2 liter bottles of pop....he consumed all of it in less than 24 hours and whined that I still wouldnt \"buy him food.\"\n\nIf she and her kids were truly starving, she would have been grateful.", "NTA. \n\n1. If she didn't want the food, she should have returned it instead of throwing it out. \n2. She insulted your act of kindness and your food choices, instead of simply thanking you for the gesture and explaining that they have different dietary needs.", "INFO did you talk to her about this beforehand or just show up with a bag of random food?", "ESH. Sorry, but you both wasted food. \n\nShe sucks for throwing it all out, but if you had taken 3 minutes to ask her \"hey, do you want these hotdogs etc?\" you would have learned that the food would have been wasted on her, and would have been able to donate it accordingly or just use it yourself.", "ESH \n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have thrown it away, but it would have taken you no effort to drop her a text and ask what would be helpful.", "NTA. I\u2019d have flipped out, too. And for sure, I\u2019d never give/buy her food again.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

There are public food banks that she can go to for assistance.  She doesn't need to mooch off of you.", "NTA , what a terrible mother to rather let her kids be hungry just to get points against you.", "NTA", "NTA and never give her anything else.", "Nope, she's the AH.   When you need help you don't always get to dictate the solution.", "Nope NTA. If she didn't want it she SHOULD have returned it to you with a thank you but we're not able to eat xyz things. That was incredibly rude and wasteful of her. Wouldn't ever try helping her again and if she complained tell her you don't want to hear it.", "Just a heads-up, there are some really twisted minds out there who would never admit to appreciate the help. Instead, they'd say stuff like this to imply that the help was below their standards and you should do better next time. Their goal is to mooch off your guilt and get more expensive stuff.\n\nBut you shouldn't flip out on someone who asked for help, that's just not cool.\n\nSo I'll say ESH in this case.", "This sentence is not always true. \n\nBeggars are still humans and should be treated with respect. If a poor person ask you for help for food or clothes and you can afford it easily but you decide to use them as a garbage can (give them your old, maybe even broken stuff or the things laying in your freezer for months bc you will not eat it or bc its bad quality), instead of giving them the money to buy what they really need, thats an ah move and in fact a lot of charity organisations deal with this problem. If you need a wintercoat for your kid, you are not greatful for summerdresses or if a homeless person ask you for food and you give him stuff that needs to be cooked, he literally can't use it. \n\nIn OPs case on the other hand, they saying its true. She has limited ressources herself and can't afford to give money away but decided to share the little she has with her friend and gave her the same stuff she eats herself (not lower quality or old stuff). Throwing it away and not just give it back was a huge AH move and i admit, i myself wouldn't help her anymore. \n\nOP, you are NTA", "There are several subs that prove that incorrect.", "She could have just declined to take it from you in the first place instead of throwing it away. I\u2019d have been mad too.", "If she really needed food, she wouldn't have thrown perfectly good food out and been snobby about what she feeds to her kids.", "I\u2019m starting to think that\u2019s where she was heading. I know her and her kids pretty intimately and they don\u2019t have food allergies or anything. I could see if she or them had deadly allergies.", "I also thought or donate it to a food bank! There\u2019s one in our town that isn\u2019t far from her house.", "I also know for a fact none of it was expired because I had just purchased it about a week prior. What really set me off was the fact that I have a kid myself and he 100% would have eaten the stuff if she didn\u2019t want it. This was my final straw and I refuse to help her again. I\u2019m\nactually still very livid and this happened a few days ago. I mean my son is still going to be fed but it\u2019s the fact that the food went to total waste. It actually sent my anxiety spiraling.", "Agreed. And if a person was truly struggling to feed themselves and their kids, they wouldn\u2019t be throwing away food. Something seems off. To me, it seems like she is either complaining for attention, or monetary handouts, not food.", "I totally understand this! It actually breaks my\nheart because I saw her daughter a few days later and she told me she wanted the hot dogs but her mom told her she couldn\u2019t eat them.\nLike wtf! We have a strained relationship sometimes so I starting to assume she was just being petty.", "That\u2019s what really just sent me over, her attitude over it isn\u2019t a big deal. I\u2019ve gone to bed hungry in my life and it just really sent me over.", "She had been complaining for the last few weeks about food, I asked her if she wanted to pick a few bags up and she said she \u201cdidn\u2019t have gas\u201d\nso I dropped it off on my way to a doctors appointment, Told her via text I was stopping by with some things and she said okay.", "But she could have just returned the stuff she doesn't want.", "Ah yes because people cant give it back after recieving food so they have to throw it away, right. And people who REALLY dont have any food and complain about it would be grateful for it (as long as they eat meat etc) and NOT throw it away. She threw everything away. Even eggs. The fact she said \"things like hotdogs\" just proves she is way too entitled and wanted some gourmet kaviar dish or something. \n\nAnd i cant believe you told someone they wasted food by donating food. To someone who complains about not having food. With children. That is so weird its almost hilarious", "When you are complaining and begging someone for food or whatever, you don\u2019t get to be picky with what you want. Take what you get or you don\u2019t ask for it at all. If you really have no food, or money for food, you eat what you have/get.", "Giving what you can verse what you want to is not an AH move. Yes charities deal with that all the time because charity is not required, there is no rule or even expectation to give what you do not want to.\n\nI do agree everyone deserves respect but charity is a choice that everyone gets to make for themselves.", "But then you wouldn't have given them food they're allergic to. NTA.", "That is just so wrong.  You did something out of the goodness of your heart and were so unappreciated for it and you should never have been made to feel that way.  My husband bought food for a friend of his once, he was raising his son, down on his luck.  My husband bought him peanut butter and jelly, bread, ramen, things like that and he was so appreciative for it all.  That is how normal people act when someone does something kind for them.  You didn't deserve to be treated that way.", "That tells me that she really is not that desperate to feed her children. Also, if her mother is telling her what foods she can feed her hungry children, then she can get them the food they need.", "Just gonna say it - That is inching into abuse territory.", "So you didn't check if all the items you were planning on giving her were things she and her kids could/would eat and that she had the resources to prepare?\n\nI don't think you were an asshole here and she could have handled it better but I get where she's coming from.", "Or OP could have asked if she wanted those things. And upon receiving the NO, could and should have donated the food to someone else.", "> And i cant believe you told someone they wasted food by donating food.\n\nDonating food to someone who doesn't want it is a waste of food. \n\nThe only thing a person has to do when donating food is to make sure then person they're giving it to wants it. OP could have easily asked the person if they wanted the food. Instead they just dropped it off.", "You truly get someone who threw out 100 dollars worth of food but is constantly complaining about not having food? While she has children? Like she couldnt return it? And the phrasing \"something like hotdogs\" just Shows she wanted some kaviar gourmet BS. Especially since OP commented that the kids actually liked and wanted the hotdogs but the mum said they couldnt eat them and threw it away?\n\nWatch some documentaries about food wasting and the enviroment if you are so uneducated to understand her.", ">but I get where she's coming from. \n\nNot at all, when she threw away perfectly good food. All that was required was a text that said \"Hey actually my kids are allergic to this/I don't have the ability to prepare any of this, would you like to come and pick it back up, or what would you like me to do?\" Took less than 30 seconds to type that all out.", "Ummmmm.   Beggars can't be choosers.   So someone does something out of kindness yet they are supposed to call ahead and confirm their generosity \"could/would\" be accepted by the allegedly hungry kids??  The appropriate response would have been a smidgen of gratitude.", "And OP could have asked \"I can give you X, Y, and Z\" so she could have said what she couldn't use. OP clearly meant well but this was avoidable.", "Dietary restrictions are a thing. Picky kids who absolutely will not eat certain items are a thing. Not having the utensils or appliances or knowledge to cook a given food item is a thing. And, honestly, getting upset and frustrated over not having any say in what you have to eat is absolutely a thing. Her reaction was out of line but try to remember that poor people are also human beings with human emotions.", "Ummm, OP did not give her anything that needed fancy accessories? Where does it say OP provided caviar, but didn\u2019t ask if the poor recipient had a mother-of-pearl tiny spoon and blinis? If the recipient can't handle hot dogs and eggs, maybe raising a child is too much for them \ud83d\ude44", "do you make excuses for people often or do you ever hold them accountable for their actions? being poor isn\u2019t an excuse to be a greedy asshole."]}
