She could have easily given you the food back if it wasn't good enough for her to eat.", "NTA.  Wow, how ungrateful can you get...If she and her children are truly that hungry, they would have eaten the food you provided.  It's not like you gave them off the wall stuff that normal people don't eat, you essentially gave them staples.  The least she could have done was given it back if she didn't want what you gave her.

Many people have food intolerances that they don't mention and react quite badly long term to breads, hot dogs and such.\n\nI had to stop using my food banks because it's mostly food that makes anyone sick if they eat it full time. Yes I wasn't starving but I wasn't getting nutrition and getting sicker and more lethargic. Being on disability for severe health issues, I had to choose the option of having less food versus free food.\n\nComplicated situation, hence your comments.", "I think I'm being misconstrued? I didn't say OP was wrong. I don't think she was wrong at all. I think her friend was wrong for not being appreciative and throwing the food away. If she didn't want the food then it's whatever, but you shouldn't just throw food away when it's still good and others could eat it.", "Is not eating pork for a religious reason or being lactose intolerant one? Because I think those are the examples I gave. Just say you hate homeless people and go.", "NTA\n\nShe was being extremely ungrateful and entitled for having complained of having no food at all.", "Definitely entitled.\n\nI remember a time a young relative contacted me for money.  He and his roommates were scrimping for money (they had been eating Ramen for three days after paying rent).  I had $10, but I called the rest of the family.  They came over with food.  Lots and lots of food (LOL)!   \n\nWhen one of his roommates drove over, they had to make multiple trips to the car to take all the food out as we had boxes for them.  And we were able to give him $75.  They were so thankful that when they got home, each of them got on the phone to thank us.  By helping them, they didn't have to buy food for two months, which allowed them to get caught up on their bills.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe should have returned the food to you if she wasn\u2019t willing to serve it to her kids. But she shouldn\u2019t expect that you will go to the store and spend additional money to shop for her. It\u2019s not ungrateful to decline food that doesn\u2019t fit her household\u2019s needs (lots of people don\u2019t eat hot dogs, and my spouse has recently been advised to cut down on eggs and cheese). It\u2019s ungrateful to waste it when you could have eaten it.", "She's the AH!!\n\nDietary restrictions is bull.  If she didn't want she could have given you back since on a fixed income yourself.\n\nShe's just selfish beggar", "Being upset she threw it out - no, not the TA. \n\nGiving her food without checking first - tiny AH.  \n\nI was in a position once where I was really broke.  I had someone \u201chelp\u201d me.  They gave me a bunch of things I was allergic to.   I gave it back to them because I couldn\u2019t utilize it.  I certainly didn\u2019t throw it out.  \n\nI have been listening to people who have been homeless talk lately, in an attempt to grow as person and learn about an experience I have never had to go through.   They talk a lot about how demoralizing it is to have someone walk up to you and give you things and demand that you be grateful for it because you are perceived to have less or to be in need.  People give them things they don\u2019t want.  It\u2019s obvious that they are things not wanted.   Old, tattered, past date\u2026 and yet they demand to be thanked. \n\n\nShe shouldn\u2019t have thrown the food out.  She should have told you when you gave it to her that she couldn\u2019t use it and let you take it back.  \nIn future if you want to help someone, say \u201chey I\u2019m heading to the store, I can I pick you up a couple things? I was thinking I would get\u2026.. would that be ok?\u201d  that way you don\u2019t get asked for $300 worth of things or just asked for cash instead.  I personally dislike when I want to help someone and they just ask for cash instead.  I like knowing what my money is going to.  Maybe that is just me.", "NTA.  This person acted entitled and ungrateful.  They complained about food insecurities because they wanted help.  You gave it to them, and in turn they threw out what you gave them and complained that you didn't give them what they wanted.  It's fair that they might not want to eat what you offered.  If that were the case, they shouldn't have accepted or they should have returned what they felt they wouldn't eat.", "NTA.  You did something to help her at no little cost to yourself.  She pissed on the gesture and you.  I would have said the same thing.  I have spent a few days where popcorn was the only available main course because money ran out before next pay check.  I would have loved to be gifted that much food, regardless of what it was.", "NTA don\u2019t help her again she needs to learn her lesson.", "NTA.hat a choosing beggar!", "NTA. My response would have been the same as yours. But I suspect a lot of redditors are very supportive of extremely \"picky\" people --look at how often someone complains about being expected to eat the same thing other family members eat. It is easy to take offense when someone rejects widely acceptable food for whatever reason and complains that someone else didnt cater to their taste or habits. Perhaps you should have asked before offering. She certainly should have asked you before throwing it out.", "Hell, she could've given it back to OP!\n\nIt's kinda rude, but at least the food wouldn't have been wasted.", "NTA\n\n1 you have away did which you would have eaten yourself,  but stuff that would be thrown away if you didn't donate it. \n\n2 while she may not want to eat or feed her children hot dogs,  if this is the case she can decline them rather than accepting and then throwing away.", "There are also serious issues with food that aren't allergies that most people dismiss as preferences. More than solely life threatening allergies are valid. I turned down a lot of food when I was shameless and went hungry. I've got a bad immune system, I can't just pick the mold off like most people and be fine. I'm also autistic with sensory issues - to most people In just a picky eater and stubborn, because I will gag and vomit if I try to force myself to eat thing I cannot tolerate.\n\nThe point is that even if I didn't have these issues, I am a person and deserve decent food that I like if it's available. If someone is going to buy me $10 of food, they should ask what I like. If someone is going to offer what they can spare from what they already have, I'll be grateful even if I have to decline some or all of it.\n\nThe above commenter is warning against the blanket idea that our people should be grateful for whatever scraps they're given, because in any case where you are buying things to donate, not just donating what you can spare, the recipient deserves dignity. This is not about the OP, but the blanket idea that needing helps strips away dignity and should always mean gratitude for things that aren't great.\n\nThe majority of what gets donated to poor people is expired (for food) or broken (for items). And is ONLY donated because it was being thrown away anyway. And the majority of food drives where people actually go out and buy food to donate are plain canned beans and the like. Not the equally shelf stable canned goods complete with seasonings. Definitely not gluten free options. Certainly nothing they themselves would actually eat.\n\nAs an adult I've been on the receiving end. When I pick up my \"fresh\" food box, it's 90% rotting and moldy. When I visit the food pantry, ther eis nothing that can possibly be eaten without access to a kitchen, being homeless was the worst. When I had a kitchen and still needed a food pantry, there was nothing I could actually eat because I have so many medical issues. When anyobe offers me help, they tend to bring over a lasagna, very popular meal to give, but I'm allergic to tomatoes - they don't ask, and I should be grateful. It's the thought that counts! I can't eat thoughts. As a child we were lower middle class and engaged in those can drives at school and church. We never donated a single item we would actually want to consume. It was either 3 years expired green beans from the back of the pantry or, if we went out shopping to donate, the cheapest plain single ingredient that absolutely no one actually eats as a meal. It wasn't even cheaper to buy a can of plain beans than a can of soup with meat and veggies, or a can of pasta, or chili. But we always donated the plain beans.\n\nI've even been told I should be grateful that people spent MY MONEY on things I can't eat because they didn't HAVE to shop for me at all, they could have let me starve because I was too disabled to go to the store. I still went hungry but was supposed to be grateful that I had shelves full of food I can't eat and can't replace because they spent my whole grocery budget on it.\n\nThe point was that blanket statements can perpetuate harm, and the idea that donating is more about patting yourself on the back than actually helping someone. Pointing that out regularly is how culture shifts and homeless and impoverished people begin to be seen more often as people with basic dignity.", "Thank you! And I agree with you. It is complex and complicated. Throwing the food away was horrible given that OP is also low income and could have eaten the food herself. I think OP is a good person and donated what she could. She shouldn't be judged for that. People do use food banks as dumping grounds and I find it mean.", "You laid it out better than I did in my reply. It is complicated, and less of good food is better than a lot of filler long term. But you can't complain because it's ungrateful and at least you're not starving...", "NTA", "NTA- I f she was really that hard up for food she would have eaten whatever you gave her\u2026", "NTA. \n\nIt was reasonable that you flipped out over wasted food. I would do the same thing if my sister or someone else in my family did that.\n\nYour family member on the other hand, A", "NTA\n\nDon't feel guilty, you tried to help someone who was not only acting entitled but totally wasteful...definitely don't feel guilty or help her anymore", "NTA at all. This belongs in r/ChoosingBeggars", "NTA", "You have limited means yourself and tried to help her. Just throwing away $100 of food is just plain inexcusable. She can go to the food pantry herself and get what she wants. Never help her again. NTA", "NTA, you tried to help. Your cousin should have returned the food OR not taken it to begin with if they were not items she could use. Throwing it away shows she did not value the gesture. Take a deep breath and let this go, but do not give her anything else ever again.  Lessons learned, move on.", "NTA and she\u2019s a choosy beggar all right. Make that the last time you ever give her anything.", "NTA... regardless of if she would eat it, she was rude to throw out a gift. She could have returned.  This was her daying she wanted cash and what you gave was beneath her. \n\nI'm sorry, but shes an AH. Please ignore her.", "Or it was old and freezer burnt stuff from the freezer. (Step sister did this to me) Those are literally the ONLY reasons I could imagine someone throwing out food that was given to them, and like you're saying even if they're allergic they can always give it back!", "But we are not talking about those other hypothetical situations. It was incredibly evil to do that and I wonder hungry she really is to throw away good food like that. It was so disrespectful, beyond, especially when people are starving in the world and a lot of them are children too. No, just no.", "Being grateful is important.\n\nI was once given a rather large frozen pork roast, and a half gallon of milk. The milk was way over date and already swelled, and upon proper thaw, the roast was unsafe in any cooking method. I was sad about it, but I would eat dirt before announcing it. \n\nThere are many comments regarding poor quality food from foodbanks. Recent (2 yrs ago?) Cdn federal government announced a plan to assist those with food insecurity, millions of dollars was provided-to food banks. Yet, the hampers given still contained ancient kidney beans, molding greens and just unpalatable items (like noodles and no sauce, cranberry sauce)-These things may save a person from starving to death, but literal millions was provided to purchase fresh food that was not purchased.\n\nBeing grateful is important-Preserving dignity, is equally important. It is incredibly hard and painful to ask for help, and very disheartening when the 'help' is that brutal.\n\nWith all that said, hotdogs fried up in chunks with potatoes and some peas in a pan is quite tasty! \n\nop is nta- the friend could have returned it to her.", "I sympathise with what you went through and the additional struggles you faced, but I want to make it clear: dietary *requirements*, including medical ones, are not what I'm talking about. Food by definition needs to be edible, so it also doesn't include anything rotten or expired, unless it's still edible. And on that note, I've bought things as a broke student at discount because they're close to expiring and have eaten them after expiry. \n\nBut you also seem either young or relatively naive, and/or still a little entitled. \n\nMost people on Reddit aren't that well off. Or have had at least experience with being poor, even if just for stretches during uni. \n\nLuxuries are nice. Seasoning is nice. But if you're actually starving, you're looking to maximise calories and macro- and micro- nutrients. In a pinch, only calories. \n\nSo get off your high horse, because ***that's*** why your family donated plain beans instead of canned soup. They're not being mean, they're trying to donate the most amount of actual useful food they can for a fixed budget.", "Someone below put it better - it's actually NOT about maximizing calories first and foremost. Sacrificing calories for actual nutrition is actually more ideal. It costs more to be more balanced, and you end up with less volume. But subsisting on nothing but plain starches destroys a person long term. Malnourishment leads to lethargy, brain fog, and other medical problems long term. You know what makes homelessness and/or poverty harder to cope with/escape? Medical issues from malnourishment. If you only need to fill in a meal here and there in an occasional bad spot, any empty calories will do. If you have to survive long term in poverty, one can of soup with meat and veggies is FAR better than 6 cans of beans, because you can actually jeep your body and brain functioning. It's actually better to donate quality than quantity.\n\nWe donated plain beans because it was cheap and sheer volume was put above nutrition. But nutrition actually matters more than sheer calories for staying functional, and if you don't stay functional when you're homeless, you die."]}
