Since I am the responsible one, she always comes to me when in a pinch. \n\nShe found out last minute that insurance won't cover her tummy tuck. She lost over 100 lbs 2 years ago and is dealing with a lot of extra skin that is making her uncomfortable. \n\nThe reason I said no to loaning her 6k for this is because she still owes me 6k from 2020 that she has never paid back. She brings this money up often and says she will start paying me back, but she never does. She claims to always be financially unable, but somehow, has the money for new tattoos and other new things. I have never brought up the money to her. I am have been very patient with her about it. \n\nIn the past year, she has borrowed 3k for a down-payment for a brand new car, which I was promised she would pay be back in 2 months, but it took her a year. And she has also borrowed 1k for her bill, which she also promised to pay back right away, but it took several months.\n\nAs I said previously, she still owes me 6k from 2020 because she couldn't work and needed the money during the pandemic. That is fine and well. But since then, I have become a stay at home parent, and my spouse is our only income. We do not live big, but we have enough to pay our bills and some extra to buy things we want and need. \n\nWhen my mom asked me, I had told her no and told her I didn't have 6k cash. She asked me to put it on a credit card, and I again told her no because she still hasn't paid me back from 2020. She pleaded that she would pay me back asap. I told her that it puts a lot of stress and pressure on me and my marriage when she borrows money from me and does not pay it back when she says she's going to. She still continued to tell me she would pay me back asap. I told her no and that she needed to find another way. She told me I was her only way due to her having a low credit score and that she knew no one else that could lend her the money.\n\nI feel extremely guilty for not giving her the money because I know how much she wants this tummy tuck and how uncomfortable she feels every day with all the extra skin. Am I the asshole for telling her to find another way? Should I have given her the money and hoped that she would have paid me back in a timely manner?\n\nEDIT: She works as does her husband. Last minute insurance declined her. Her surgery is in two weeks, so it's time sensitive, and that's why she can't save up for it.", "created_utc": 1701476079, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/188qn84/aita_for_not_giving_my_mom_6k_for_her_elective/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
