Most people who can't afford IVF can't afford the kid, and that's before insurance step in.\n\nThere's a level where you have to consider if the kid will have any....I can't think of the right wording. If you can afford to give the kid things like schooling when they're older (uniforms and meals aren't free). It's not a case of 'im rich I can have kids' it's a case of 'our finances can take a hit for a kid' and that's not a simple answer.

They're human beings who have a right to grow up in a home with a secure financial situation. I can see your point in that the current economic distribution across at least the US is vastly skewed against minorities, but that doesn't change the fact that children deserve a home that is able to provide for them, but adults/couples don't 'deserve' children just bc they want to, not unless they can meet that child's needs. Telling people who can't afford children to not have children isn't racist, just like saying you shouldn't make any huge financial decisions when you can't afford it isn't racist. That being said, medical care/child care is ungodly and ridiculously expensive in the US at least, and so many families that could provide a loving, happy home for a child are excluded just due to these unnecessary inflated costs.", "Lucky you but not the case with a good portion of the rest of the world- I grew up with food stamps and no breakfast and lunch on the weekend which was the standard for my peers as well.

We had no heat during winter, never owned a winter coat till I was in high school, never left my neighborhood or been out a 10 block radius till I left for college, shoes were once every 5 years( they are malformed now) and I have a broken knee cap that\u2019s now dissolving away.\n\nIf you have the option to wait and make a more secure environment for a child and you do not then you are a jackass and an asshole of the highest order.", "I will take that as a no, then?", "I'm in Texas.

But the clomid was less than $100, and I think the trigger shot was around $300. So our most expensive IUI cost us just under $1000. I'm sure prices vary at different clinics.

You can afford monthly payments on mortgage, but you don\u2019t have the deposit. What do you do? Sometimes you turn to family. Same with ivf.

But a house won't require time off. It won't require you to have a period out of work on maternity (paid but less so, if allowed). It doesn't require new expenses over time (I know you call in experts if you need a repair. These are one offs, not multiple unless you got the shaft). A house can often also mean your not paying rent which takes a good deal of your income as opposed to moving out of free into a new.\n\nA house, rented or bought, is a constant expense.

I agree with what you say about the US, the healthcare and childcare options here are horrid and unrightfully excludes so many people from being able to provide for a child, even if they could easily do so living in another country and I wish we had more resources available to allow more children to grow up in a stable, safe environment. I actually plan to move somewhere with a more socialist government once I'm able. My family was white, and we were poor growing up. It is my genuine belief that me and my brother should not have been brought into this world by our parents, and that they were selfish for having children they couldn't afford. I'm not sticking up for the way America treats those trying to have or who already have children, it's a very 'fend for yourself' attitude, which I think is detrimental to society.
