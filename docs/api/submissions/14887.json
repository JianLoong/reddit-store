You never know when you may need your family, like even just for emotional support rather than for something more concrete. You said you could afford it.", "Go tell an abused orphan in an orphanage about your waaah fertility problems.", "Yes it is.", "It\u2019s also (atleast generally speaking) a horrible idea to put that much on your credit card and making monthly payment. I can\u2019t imagine what the about of interest paid will be in the end.  Obviously emergencies happen and sometimes that\u2019s the only option but it\u2019s definitely something to avoid if at all possible.", "We had zero family help... Next sentence... I can count on my hands the number of times that family has helped out... which is it? \n\nBet you she never even had IVF to begin with. Can't trust a liar.", "La-di-da, aren\u2019t you special?", "THANK YOU. I'm adopted. All of these comments saying how much money they paid for IVF treatments is so disturbing to me. IVF is also apparently pretty hard on a woman's body too. \n\nI understand adoption has a lot of crazy red tape. But it seems like most people jump straight to IVF when they have problems conceiving. They don't even seem to consider fostering or adoption, let alone try it. Which makes me wonder if it's even about the \"red tape\" at all.\n\nI'm sick of kids in the system being thought of as damaged or less than. :/", "Holy fuck you're dense. Zero family help means you don't have consistent familial help.", "There seems to be some illogical math happening here.  Ivf =$10k per shot.  In the US it is estimated to cost $15k-$17k per year to raise a child.\n\nSeems pretty simple to me that there are families out there that can afford $15k a year but can't afford $25k or $35k or $45k since it doesn't always work.\n\nThat being said I don't think anyone is obligated to help pay for others ivf but saying if you can't afford ivf you can't afford a child is asinine!", "Needing $20K+ up front just to conceive a child is much different. These comments stating if you can\u2019t afford to pay for your own IVF and that correlating with being unfit financially to have a child are ridiculous. Yes childcare and other expenses add up but the cost of IVF all within a very short span of time is not a fair comparison.", "Are you confused as to what zero means? Zero means NOTHING.\n\nIf you found twenty bucks here and then a week later found a hundred dollars and someone asked you how much money you'd found, would you say $120? Or would you say zero? Because one is accurate to the amount found over time, and the other isn't accurate at all unless you twisted the narrative to mean \"oh I didn't find any TODAY\" whilst neglecting to mention you had found money prior.", "where I live NICU is free. My naturally conceived child had many many hospital stays, medical equipment usage, home oxygen, medical devices, tests, and medical visits for free.\n\nIVF however is often difficult and chunks are not covered and the public waiting list can be long enough there's risk of further fertility decline.", "Using the house as an example, what if a pipe bursts in the house and it's not covered by insurance? You have to pony up thousands to get it fixed in order to live in your house. Kids can and will have unexpected expenses. Kids are not inexpensive. For example, my son had an unexpected health problem (became T1D) last year. Bills were in the 6 figures, insurance (we have awesome insurance) covered most of it, but we still had to pay $4,000 out of pocket. Kid expenses are not just healthcare, but also clothing, food, hobbies, school, and childcare."]}
