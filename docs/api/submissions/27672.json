Before we met, my fiancee would take care of him like a second mom. He spends most of his time watching tv in her room, because he can't really go outside by himself while everyone is away or working.\n\nAt the end of the workday, my fiancee likes to change into more comfy clothes, which includes taking off her bra, so when she does change she's almost naked... \n\nHer mom is really strict, and asked/told us to while we live with her, we will not share any kind of intimacy until we're married (including watching eachother get dressed) to which we agreed. \n\nShe usually changes early, and her little brother is usually still in there watching tv, never gets kicked out. I didn't think anything of it because... well he's got autism, and I figured he wouldn't break his hyperfixation on the tv anyways. \n\nOne time we were doing the wedding registry together, and he was watching tv while we were in there. She says she wants to change but is ok with me being there, \"as long as mom doyfind out we're good\". I mean we're going to get married for Christ's sake. Anyways as she starts stripping, her brother's attention shifts away from the tv, and he stares at her for the whole time she's getting dressed. I expressed my annoyance to her and she replied \"he doesn't know anything, he's just a kid\"\n\nThen one time i come up to go to the bathroom at 2am (I sleep on the opposite side of the house from her) and I walked in him whacking off in the bathroom. I only saw because he goes with the door open, I guess he doesn't like the claustrophobia or something.\n\n So now I'm upset, like sure, down and mild autism will leave you mentally underdeveloped, but he's still a guy, 18 years at that, and that sexual part of us is wired into our brains. Sure he may not understand to the full extent what's going on, but staring when she changes in front of him, understanding enough to jack off, coupled with his increased hostility towards me when he realized I wasn't just a friend and I was going to take away \"my Rachel\" as he refers to her is Starting to trigger my jealousy.\n\nI don't know enough about down to make a judgement call on this but I do know that the autistic people I know tend to hyperfixate, as well as lack the ability to filter. When I raised how I was upset to my MIL she got very upset at me, uncharacteristic of her and said everything was fine and on e again \"he's just a kid\"", "created_utc": 1695745825, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sso4z/aita_for_asking_my_fiancees_autistic_brother_to/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The brother is an 18 year old man.  Autistic people are fully capable of sexual activity, thoughts, feelings, and arousal.  They're not stupid and they're not children and they're not incapable of understanding that being a coomer around your sister is inappropriate.  And it is weird and inappropriate that your sister and MIL think this is okay or normal.  NTA.", "Yeah, that's not okay. NTA\n\nI don't care if he has mild autism, Down Syndrome, or not. It's inappropriate. He's an 18yo man and they aren't doing any good for him by treating him as if he's \"just a kid\". They make it seem like autistic people or people with downs don't have relationships, get married, have sexual thoughts, etc. He absolutely should be leaving the room while she changes. It's also weird that her mom is okay with the brother being in the room while she changes but not you, her future husband.\n\nEdit: Also, meant to address bringing this up to your MIL. That's a conversation you should have with your girl, not her mom lol. Also, you mentioned being jealous. I hope you're using the wrong word and aren't feeling jealous more than weirded out. It shouldn't be about jealousy and more about him not seeing his sister's tits all the time and treating him as if he's a dim-witted child.", "NTA - talk to your fiancee. If she really doesn't see a problem, you need to consider whether you have a problem with that dynamic and make a decision. To all the people saying he's just a kid or \"stop watching porn\" - incest is a thing. It's disgusting, but it is possible that her brother is into her. You can't assume he is or is not based on the info, so stop treating OP like a major perv", "NTA but I think you're going about it the wrong way. Don't frame this as a jealousy thing, frame it as a safety issue. \n\nIt is a thing that developmentally disabled people hit puberty and feel sexual urges without the mental capacity to understand what's happening or direct that urge appropriately. That can be really dangerous -- they understand that they're bigger and stronger and want new things without the ability to understand why they shouldn't just take them. My husband is an educational assistant (like an aide in the US) and his last student was a 14yo with severe delays from a childhood TBI. The kid had learned that hitting my husband and masturbating in front of him got reactions and attention that he liked, so he continued escalating this behavior until my husband left. I'm certainly not saying this leads directly to sexual harassment and assault in every case, but it is behavior that needs to be handled to prevent that risk. \n\n\"He's just a kid\" yeah, exactly, he's a child with the body of a grown man.

Whether or not he's a neurotypical 18 year old or an 18 year old with developmental disabilities, it seems like he's being treated like he isn't even another person in the room.\n\nYou feeling jealous is really missing the point, IMO. I'd be more concerned and uncomfortable as to why my fiancee doesn't seem to think she needs to consider the fact that there are other family members in the room while she changes or even say anything to him. It's no surprise he doesn't have any sense of consent when it comes to staring at someone naked - the family is treating him like he has no need to consent or not to being present for them changing. She didn't tell him to look away or step out.\n\nHim being autistic or having downs doesn't mean changing in front of him is appropriate for HER to choose to change in front of him with no warning and while just going \"eh, he doesn't know anything\".

That means closing the door when you're being intimate with yourself and leaving the room if someone wants to change. The fact that he's hostile toward OP because he's going to marry his sister also doesn't sit well and he probably also needs a conversation about what healthy adult relationships look like. Unfortunately, if the family believes he's just a kid who can do no wrong, he's going to have some real social problems and could get himself in trouble if he crosses boundaries.", "Yeah that's why I'm wary, I don't know which it is, simple instinct coupled with emotional attachment, I don't want to break the kids heart, like I realize I'm really changing his routine which is probably the reason for the aggression... I dunno, I just wanted outside opinion because I'm biased to want my fiancee's sexuality to myself, and their biased towards the child that they worked so hard to raise.", "do they have Down syndrome?", "Or you can have a severely down syndrome family member", "He\u2019s possessive of a Down syndrome guy calling his sister \u201cmy Rachel\u201d?", "I honestly don't know what I feel about that policy as there are lots of good arguments for and against it given that prostitution is legal in your country.", "I dunno I've only seen him do it once and I've run into a few of his 2am bathroom trips... Also, I don't know how far is down syndrome goes, cuz apparently he used to be quite articulate, but now he speaks like someone who barely knows English in broken sentences. He is capable of humor and quite a few other normal human interactions, so I don't want to judge what's in his mind and what I don't know.", "See except you only have to leave the room if the person is uncomfortable. Also I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve ever tried to have a conversation with someone who has a severe case of Down syndrome. The possessiveness is 100% normal. You can explain to him why it\u2019s wrong. The issue is that you\u2019re thinking in terms of talking to someone who will understand what you\u2019re saying. Try to explain to a 2 year old why something is wrong. You also seem to be leaving out that she helped raise him. Also that\u2019s his fault for renting a place in her families home. He\u2019s marrying this girl and it sounds like he didn\u2019t know her situation well. This should have come up WELL before marriage. So to tell the whole family that THEY have to change because he\u2019s \u201cjealous\u201d of her Down syndrome brother makes him TA. Just move on if you\u2019re that bothered. Then to go tell the mom?", "It\u2019s completely irresponsible and neglectful that he has not been given any kind of sexual education. That\u2019s just a recipe for disaster. Whether he becomes a perpetrator or a victim, bad all around. His mother set him up to be in this situation.", "Do you exclusively let people with Down syndrome look at you naked? \nWhat exactly is your point?", "Just because someone has down syndrome (and autism) doesn't mean they are incapable of understanding boundaries and consent. Toddlers are able to grasp these concepts. If you tell a 7-year-old to not touch you like that and they do it again, they aren't being ignorant, they're being malicious. \n\nIt also doesn't matter if he's her brother or not. He's obviously capable of being sexual and is interested in the female form. That's fine but he needs some context, specifically about consent and boundaries (i.e. leaving the room when someone is changing, not ogling people, and the importance of privacy). His family is doing no favors by treating him like a child when he's clearly more developed than that, and giving him the impression that boundaries don't apply to him.", "If they did and they SA-ed you (twice), that wouldn't make it okay.", "That doesn't matter. I treat them like everyone else", "I think if those prostitutes want it themselves it's ok i think. I'm so used to it beeing legal here it's weird to me that it isn't in other places.", "Ok because this seems to be a big question. What are you jealous of? Also you joined a family that\u2019s been doing this for 18 years. Did you not know about this? It\u2019s clearly not new. This sounds like something you should have been aware of before proposing. You want an entire family to change how they\u2019ve been operating because you chose to stay in their house and are uncomfortable?", "Why are you so adamant about this guy being able to look at his sisters tits", "He definitely shouldn't have laid into his future MIL (he should've had a calm discussion with his fianc\u00e9) and calling it \"jealousy\" is definitely not the right word (I'd go with \"discomfort\"), but I can't disagree with OP that this situation is f-ed up.\n\nI'm not sure why you're adamant that the brother has the mental capabilities of a two-year-old. Most people with down syndrome have the mental capabilities of an 8 or 9-year-old, and they can certainly understand conversations about consent and boundaries.\n\nMy father helped raise me and I never stayed in the room when he got naked (even at the age of eight) let alone stared at him while he was in the buff, so I'm not sure what your point is there. \n\nIf the family is comfortable with this dynamic, then OP should probably just let it go. However, there are some important red flags that shouldn't be tossed aside. First, the brother is obviously sexual but it doesn't sound like he's been taught about boundaries. Second, he's ogling his naked sister but isn't asked to leave the room because he's \"just a kid\". Third, he's possessive of his sister to the point he's hostile toward his future BIL but no one seems to be addressing that. Lastly, it sounds like his family allows him to do whatever he wants because he has a disability, regardless of the fact that he can probably grasp the importance of consent and privacy.", "The point is that you seem to be talking like he\u2019s a normal functioning person. He is an 18 year old with severe Down syndrome who doesn\u2019t know any better and idolizes a woman who helped raise him. OP is a 20 year old normal male who is \u201cjealous\u201d of his finances Down syndrome brother.", "You think he\u2019s as smart as a 7 year old? And yes. Him being able to understand that jerking off feels good means he has basic animals instincts. Now tell me. What\u2019s OP jealous of?", "That wouldn\u2019t make it ok. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here. I notice you have something to say about everything except why he\u2019s jealous.  You\u2019re bringing up things that have nothing to do with this situation. There\u2019s a woman who helped raise her Down syndrome brother. Sometimes she changes in front of him. Always has. No one in the family is uncomfortable with it. This dude comes out of no where. Proposed to a girl that he clearly didn\u2019t know that well and he\u2019s uncomfortable with it so wants them to change. That\u2019s all it is. But can you tell me why he\u2019s jealous of this?", "I agree that it's probably fine if the prostitutes do the work by choice and aren't trafficked or coerced, but I've also read things from disability advocates and disabled people who don't think the policy is helpful. Their main point being that it further stigmatizes disabled people and essentially suggests that they can only have sex if they hire a prostitute. While that may be the case for people with severe disabilities, it also projects a harmful stereotype for people with more minor disabilities.", "If the entire family took showers together, and had been doing so for years, he probably wouldn't be able to change their minds about that either. That doesn't mean he's not allowed to be uncomfortable about it or raise concerns.", "Why won\u2019t you just tell me what OP is jealous of?", "I'd say the biggest issue I have in this is I don't know what his developmental level is cuz one, I've only lived with them for 2 months, and two, the problem he has is articulation, and maybe comprehension. (You have to tell him things over and over and over again, like put your CDs away in the case so they don't get scratched) I don't know if he's just following instinct s or not because he can't or isn't telling anyone. One thing I can corroborate though is that I know for sure that he has not been taught about sex, intimacy, or consent.\n\nI mainly came here to kind of get closure and second opinions, and I thank you guys for all your replies. We are getting married next summer and then we'll be together in the privacy of the basement apartment. We won't have this problem anymore and by then my MIL will have more time to be able to focus solely on teaching her child.", "I know plenty of people with Down syndrome and they are\u2026people. With a wide range of thoughts and feelings. \nIn your other comments you equate them to animals and monkeys so\u2026", "You\u2019re a weirdo dude\u2026 this is a strange hill to die on lmfao", "Most people with down syndrome have the mental capabilities of a 8-9 year old. So yes, it's not a stretch to assume he's as \"smart\" as a 7yo.", "The problem is that people aren't even trying to explain things. Explain boundries. And keep explaining. There is a big chance he wouldn't understand. But i know a lot disabled people, and a lot aren't even told about boundries.", "And you can't seem to steer away from the word \"jealous\" when there are a lot bigger red flags to focus on. I've already said what I had to say about that ad nauseum. Your inability to comprehend is not my problem.", "\"You can't ogle your fianc\u00e9 while she's naked but her brother can\" is certainly not something I'd want to hear from my future MIL.", "I equated HIM to animals. Yes. He has basic animal instincts down. If you read my other comments you would see I said there was a wide range. His seems to be more severe. But what\u2019s op jealous of?", "You still can\u2019t tell me what he\u2019s jealous of? Everyone\u2019s saying he\u2019s NTAH but can\u2019t tell me what he\u2019s jealous of", "Better question. If she\u2019s ok and not uncomfortable why does he care? Is he \u201cjealous\u201d as he put it because her down syndrome brother is seeing her boobs?", "Or the family is ok with the dynamic that has set. Everyone has different boundaries. He\u2019s clearly not ok with something that rest of the family is. OP is the one with boundary issues. Not the family", "Why do you keep saying \u201cogle\u201d? He said stared at her", "OP says he has the mental capabilities of a 12-year-old. He's not so severely impaired that he can't understand \"close the door when you jerk off\" and \"leave the room when your sister is changing\".", "He\u2019s not permitted to see his fianc\u00e9 naked, but her 18 y/o brother is practically encouraged to. OP probably has all kinds of weird gross confused feelings about it. Nobody can articulate that except OP. \n\nAre you, by chance, MIL with a throwaway account? Lmao", "Okay, by that same token, why is her brother jealous of OP? His hostility certainly seems to suggest that he doesn't like that OP is romantic with his sister.", "They have to know all the boundries. Like it's no big deal if you let to door of the toilet open at home. But not in a public place. You can walk naked at home, but when your on vacation with other people it can be weird."]}
