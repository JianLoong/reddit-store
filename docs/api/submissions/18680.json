Your parents don\u2019t deserve you or your brother. It\u2019s wonderful that you\u2019ve had financial support from them but if that\u2019s all they\u2019ve got to offer, what\u2019s the point? At least your brother knows that you love and except him exactly as he is, it\u2019s unfortunate your parents don\u2019t feel the same.", "NTA. Thank you for supporting your brother.", "NTA, homophobes are evil and should be abandoned.", "NTA, though please, mate, maybe use some paragraphs next time - that was hard to read. On the more important issue, though - no. Definitely not the A H, and you should be proud of yourself for genuinely taking a stand. It\u2019s easy to *say* the right thing, but by cutting ties with your homophobic family and declining to profit from their business any longer, you also *did* the right thing.", "NTA what other respond would have been appropriate?

Your parents have all the right in the world to cut financial/economic aid to you and your brother for whatever reason if you two have reached the age of maturity (which, based on your age of 32, you have). It's their money, it's their business, it's their choice, really. Welcome to life.\n\nJust like you decided to cut ties with them for being homophobic, they, too, decided to cut ties with your brother for being gay. Does that make any of you assholes? The parents, yes, but based on everything you wrote and the comments they made, I doubt they'll lose sleep over it. Did you screw up your own life? Not really, this just means you won't inherit the family business and they'll probably just give it to someone else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Not everyone would do what you just did! I think your dad thought your brother was going through a phase or some other dumb shit when he came out to him. But now that he has a boyfriend is makes it more real. Or he really did expect him to stay single for the rest of his life. You\u2019re not exaggerating and you should be making a whole big deal of it. Your parents are homophobic and perfectly ok with dropping all support for your brother because he is who he is. As a parent, I couldn\u2019t imagine doing that to my child!", "NTA\u2026with how the world is already\u2026just sad that he\u2019s experiencing that from his own family", "NTA you are a great brother tho. he\u2019s lucky to have you, willing to give up your comfortable financial situation in honor of your brother, not many people\nwould do that!", "You're a great brother and ally!

Hopefully everything will be ok", "True, I did have a good relationship with them but I think it\u2019s unacceptable how they behave even if it was with some stranger, but let\u2019s hope for my brothers sake that they at some point open their eyes", "Thanks!", "Thanks a lot, I think I already fixed it", "A friend pointed out that as my relationship with them was good I shouldn\u2019t have cut ties as \u201cfamily is the most important thing\u201d also I could\u2019ve continued earning well and provided the financial support for my brother securing it \nBut that makes no stance for how messed up this is", "I understand that, from the point of view of the economical aid they made a deal with him to support as he would have to stop working for 4 years and pay the whole tuition and all that so to back out of a deal to gain something to its dishonest.\n\nBut the main point people make is that \u201cfamily comes first\u201d and should\u2019ve stayed and tried to slowly help the situation while supporting my brother which would make sense except that I keep gaining while theyre a really shitty family to my brother", "HAHAHA I\u2019m so sorry I was just ranting in my old ass phone and didn\u2019t notice", "Thanks a lot!", "You're doing the right thing.

Your brother is also family, (duh) but they seem to be OK with your parents excluding him. They can't have it both ways.", "I think that\u2019s a terrible argument. \n\nFor one, your brother deserves to be loved for the person he is (which you obviously understand), and that unconditional love is the point of family first, isn\u2019t it? \n\nSecond, \u201cfamily is the most important thing\u201d goes both ways. You and your brother are also family. How incredibly unethical to suggest that you live a lie just to get money from your parent\u2019s business. \n\nAnd that brings me to my third comment, you deserve to live a life that matches your ethical beliefs, as much as you can. Staying just to profit would be damaging to who you are as a person, and I could never support that. I wish you luck.", "It's okay, I don't think my eyebrows have ever shot up quite so fast before.
