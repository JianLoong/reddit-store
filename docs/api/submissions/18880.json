The dog probably got better care than your Uncle provides.\n\nI'd tell him not to worry, because next time you aren't gonna extend the same kindness and consideration.", "NTA, your uncle is lashing out and not being reasonable.", "NTA. Kennels aren\u2019t cheap. You went above and beyond.", "Please don\u2019t waste your time worrying about the opinion of someone who \u201c\u2026recently went into hospital for drug induced psychosis and fentanyl addiction\u2026\u201d You did the right and rational thing regarding the dog\u2019s wellbeing.\n\nNTA\n\nif your uncle wants to make sure his dog doesn\u2019t spend time in a kennel he can focus on getting his shit together or he can make someone else responsible for coverage during his next hospital stay. Talk about no good deed going unpunished\u2026", "You\u2019re absolutely NTA!  Most boarding kennels are very good places for animals to stay for a couple weeks. And you said the dog is happy and healthy, so that\u2019s what matters. Maybe your uncle is confused and thought you meant that you took the dog to the pound, like to surrender him. And I\u2019m sure that would make him very upset. Maybe when he\u2019s calmed down you can explain where his pet really was, and that he safe and happy the whole time. \nYou\u2019re a good person for taking such good care of the dog, I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t cheap for you either!", "NTA You\u2019ve done nothing wrong at all.  Nothing whatsoever.  I suspect your uncle is just feeling very raw atm and extra protective of his dog.  Possibly he also feels bad for leaving him.", "NTA\n\nYou did the right thing by the dog. Your uncle is an AH and should not have a dog. He isn't responsible enough to care for himself, much less a dog.", "NTA. You paid a professional to care for the dog while your Uncle wasn't able to.", "nta, it sounds like teh dog was well taken care of.  you paid to put him in teh kennel, and you weren\u2019t capable of caring for teh dog yourself, so you came up with a good solution.", "Nta your uncle is taking his frustrations and inability to care for his pet out on you.", "NTA perhaps your uncle is taking a little of what he\u2019s been through out on you. I would just be patient with him.", "NTA.\n\nYou made the best decision for the dog while your uncle couldn't take care of it. His anger toward you isn't warranted of course, but I would give him time. You did the right thing I think your uncle will realize that eventually.", "NTA. You did what was best for the dog and your Uncle isn\u2019t seeing that. Someone needed to do something to help the dog.", "NTA. This was incredibly kind of you. \n\nYour uncle is emotionally attached to this dog (obviously and rightly so- it's his dog) and he did not make this decision. \n\nYour decision may go against his personal belief of what's 'good' for his pets, however your uncle is also struggling with decision -making right now (I do not mean this as a criticism of him - he is trying to do his best and struggling with a medical condition). \n\nThis is no different than how people with children view others' parenting decisions. If the dog's welfare was always paramount and the dog is as healthy (or more healthy) than when you got it, you did the right thing. \u2764\ufe0f", "From your Uncle's point of view you abandoned his best friend. I realize he was being taken care of but did you visit the dog or bring him to visit your Uncle? Being left with strangers can be traumatic for some dogs (not saying it was but rescue dogs often come with not good backgrounds). When your Uncle calms down offer to bring him to the kennel to meet the people and see the place so if, in the future he needs the dog looked after for an extended period of time HE is just as comfortable as his dog. Also if you didn't visit, your Uncle does have a legitimate gripe about you abandoning his dog. But since you paid out of your pocket to see to the dogs care you are NOT an A...... Just remember your Uncle is having mental health issues, he can be quick to react and very emotional.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You arranged an alternative plan and completely paid for all of it. Your uncle\u2019s apartment is not a safe place for the dog.

I was in a very similar situation as yours in many ways and did what was best to get everyone care. Please remember those words are those of a recovering addict whom also likely has some mental health components, do not beat yourself up over this.

Sounds the your addict uncle still isn\u2019t taking responsibility for his actions. He\u2019s got a lot of work to do. Please avoid him, you don\u2019t need or deserve his verbal abuse. He should be profusely thanking you.", "You did the right thing, your uncle is a psychotic drug addict.", "I'm surprised that the dogs vaccines were up to date. Bordatella has to be redone every 6 months!", "I disagree that Uncle had a legit gripe if OP didn't visit the dog while he was at the kennel. OP didn't adopt this dog. Uncle did. The Uncle who chose to abuse drugs and made himself physically and mentally unable to manage his responsibility. That is 100% on Uncle. \n\nOP is NTA in any way.", "Yeah this is what\u2019s been eating away at me. I\u2019m having a lot of self doubt and the whole situation has triggered off all my own issues and intrusive thoughts. I have bipolar and can empathise with what he\u2019s doing through. \n\nI wasn\u2019t able to visit everyday because of work and caring responsibilities but went when I could and phoned/texted the kennel owner every day to check in on pup. \n\nThe dog has been back with my uncle for several days now and all myself and other family members have been getting is tirades of verbal abuse about it. Thankfully the dog is healthy, and has been well looked after.", "I got him vaccinated before going in, managed to get some help from social work in getting that done thankfully", "I didn't say the OP was an A, far from it. They made sure the dog was taken care of. As a pet owner I wouldn't be able to bring other animals into the mix, even for a short time. Its also possible the Uncle was not in a mental state to be told that his dog was in a kennel and may still not be well. Most drug abusers continue to struggle, his dog may be his service or comfort animal which would make it harder on him feeling guilty that he failed his best friend. The OP shouldn't take what he said to heart, he's lashing out. I'm guessing that any other family pretty much have written the Uncle off and wouldn't step up to help him. Obviously if his apartment was livable the Uncle needs more help then just a social worker. Also drug abuse is a viscous cycle and in my own family I have siblings that have mental health issues, I feel pity for them.", "That is fantastic news. I dunno what he is so mad about. You were wonderful for that dog!", "Yes, the whole situation is complicated by the dog being helpful for Uncle's mental health, but the too frequent vicious cycle being difficult for the poor dog."]}
