Having someone else move in is a situation where there needs to be two \u201cyes\u201d votes, and one \u201cno\u201d is enough to shut it down. Your reaction is completely reasonable, and it looks like she is trying to turn things around to make you the villain. \n\nThis is something you should take seriously - that she is willing to make *major* life decisions for the two of you without getting your input and, when you point this out, she goes on full offense to make you the bad guy.", "The fact that you even posted this shows how comfortable she feels making decisions without asking you first. Put your foot down and say no. NTA", "NTA - In a relationship major decisions, such as who will live in your home, are usually something that people discuss with each other.  And, expressing that you want to have a say in this is no more than setting boundaries about what you need in terms of communication.", "NTA, she is. Tell her that it's your place too, and that as such, she needs to discuss things like this first with you. If you don't want her friend there, tell her. It's not an asshole move to say no now, especially when she just dropped this on you. Either way, this needs to be discussed further and you both need to bet on the same page BEFORE anyone moves in or doesn't move in.", "NTA. This has become a classic AITA theme... The partner who moves in the friend/little sister/brother/mom who is broke/moving/escaping a bad situation. One person finds it wildly disrespectful to not ask first and the other takes it as a character test or relationship fail if their wounded friend/little sister/brother/mom aren't welcomed with no questions asked.\n\nThe majority of the internet will be with you but I don't know where that leaves you... Forewarned about your fiance's stance before you committed to marriage? In counseling to build compromising and problem solving skills? Single?", "NTA try start bringing guests home to stay for few nights without talking to you first if she refuses to talk to you before bringing in her friend.", "Nta.  It is not ok to move people in without the consent of everyone involved.  This needs to be addressed.", "NTA, quickest way for this to turn on her is to call her bluff. Bring up a multitude of similar situations that she would be pissed. Or Hell just suddenly have a good friend you have but she doesn't really know then either bluff or follow through on having that friend suddenly stay. This may seem petty but flipping out on you for this rude action opened the doors. Hell is there even a reason the friend is coming? Are they escaping an abusive spouse? Are they an addict who needs a friend's help? Those are things your fiance COULD HAVE brought up the situation and asked beforehand. I'm betting you would've been supportive. But this path was rude and now I think she's doubling down cause she knows she went about it wrong. And if not, then no true offense, then this might be the time to take some blinders off and go looking for more red flags", "NTA, at all. Even if you were only roomates, she should discuss it with you beforehand, let alone when you're in a relationship. \n\n\nFor me, it is a hill to die on, because if she can decide this without you, what other big decision will be taken without you too ? How to build any kind of futur if you don't take those kind of decisions together...?", "NTA- that should have been a discussion. Your opinion matters especially if it affects your living arrangements.", "NTA - This is unacceptable. Has she done anything like this before? Think hard. It may be time to re-access your relationship.", "NTA and ask her if she prefers to move with the friend instead of you.\n\nYou need (if you are really ready to accept this friend staying with y) a contract, rent payment etc solidly set in stone  through a lawyer.\n\nIf you don't agree put your foot down as it's your home too and say no.\n\nStart searching for something to rent alone cause if she ignores or refuses both options your relationship is doomed.", "INFO:\n\nIs there any emergency like friends house burned down or the friend had to flee from an abusive relationship, to explain that your fianc\u00e9e had to make a decision without consulting you?", "NTA what's the lease say?", "Nta.  And this is a huge red flag.  It's bad enough that she thought it was ok to make this decision alone, but to then try to put you on blast for being upset is absolutely insane to me.  For her to either be that selfish or that dull to not see her fault would have me hitting the breaks on any thought of marriage.", "INFO: why is she moving in? Is she escaping an abusive relationship? If so, then I can see why your fiance made a call without you because it was urgent/necessary.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Get couples counseling or take a class on communication skills.", "NTA, are you renting, because that likely violates the lease", "No is a complete sentence. NTA. Roommate can rack off", "NTA. Good thing it's fianc\u00e9 and not wife. Doesn't seem like they care about your input.", "NTA. Believe people when they show their true colors.", "Why aren\u2019t you pushing back on this?", "NTA\n\nMaybe you should just come home with one of your friends and announce that he lives with you for the next couple of months and see how that goes over.\n\nAt the very least, you need to slow down and look at the bigger picture.  Is this a pattern with her?  Does she often do things that affect you without talking to you first?\n\nThere is a huge difference between \"her house JUST burned down so she's going to crash on our couch tonight until she can find somewhere to stay tomorrow\" and \"hey so my friend is here for two months now rearrange your life around that and you're not allowed to have any say\"  It's NOT ok that she's making this move without talking to you first.", "Exactly. If this was a \"My friend is staying over for two nights\" I'd be having a different reaction, although even that I would want to know why it's just coming up now, and going forward would want to be clear that any future guests should be discussed.\n\nNTA though, I'm introverted and that's essentially despoiling my sanctuary without my consent.", "This is a \"she's telling you who she is, are you listening?\" moment. \n\nThink about how you feel. Do you want to be treated that way the rest of your life?", "She wanted to take a short-term job in the area and wants to save money on a place to live.

Two months is extreme.", "Ok, no reason to cut your fianc\u00e9e some slack.\n\nAnd in this case you should re-evaluate where she has crossed boundaries before, have a discussion about your boundaries and you should have a discussion about the financial and legal aspects of what's happening right now. If someone would stay in my apartment for more than six weeks I had to inform my landlord and and alter my lease to adjust for the additional tenant", "NTA - For me, this would be a hill to die on. I think you need to have a talk with your fiance and let her know that if your friend was in, you will be moving out and they can work on paying for it together. Why on Earth would you marry someone who is so totally disrespectful of you?", "Do you go round telling people they get wet when they go out in the rain?", "In that case, she definitely should have talked to you first", "You're an AH", "She's usually not like this. But at least in my opinion she's refusing to admit to anything wrong and she keeps telling me how selfish I am and what an a\\*\\*hole I am.

She doesn't respect you, doesn't put you first and if its that way in your first year, SHE NEVER WILL.  RUN!!!", "NTA. Long term visitors are a 2 yes 1 no situation", "NTA.

OP, I would let her know YOUR friend BLANK will be moving in for the same two months, so you guys can set up space for them both. What? Randomly moving someone else in is a problem? Yeah, it is. \n\nI would put your foot down about the friend moving in and suggest couples counseling. This seems like a much bigger issue you need to address with her.", "This is just a taste, if you marry her expect her to steamroll you like this at any opportunity.", "Is this friend paying rent, groceries and utilities or are you having to support her. If the latter, it would be a hard no. Things like roommates are a two yes/one no.\n\nIs it your place or are both of you on the lease?", "NTA. Do you have somewhere you could go for the \u201ctwo months\u201d her friend will be living with you? Not saying to actually go, but tell your fianc\u00e9e you\u2019re going to stay with a friend or some family while her friend is there. See how she reacts to this. I\u2019d take a good hard look at if you want to spend the rest of your life with someone who makes unilateral decisions like this without a thought or concern for how it will affect you.", "If you can move out for those two months and stop your rent payment, she may figure it all out.  We both know that the new addition will become a permanent roommate who doesn\u2019t pay any rent because she is saving up for her own place.  But she will still buy takeout for herself and go shopping for makeup. \n\nYour first roommate needs your money and knew you would not be okay with this.", "NTA this is not something that should be done without the consent of both parties.", "NTA and be thankful you found out how selfish she is & how little she respects you while she was just your fiance. If it had been after a wedding, you'd be screwed.  \n\nNTA and it's time to make her your ex fiance.", "Any lease?", "Who\u2019s the friend? Girl? Guy? History? Rent?", "NTA, and this kind of thinking is a huge red flag for what the future with her will be like. Take it for the warning it is.", "Unless the house you live in is entirely in your fianc\u00e9s name and you contribute nothing to the household monetarily or in housekeeping then NTA (and even then you should expect some warning). For a night or two maybe it would be alright to spring on someone but for a two month stay Its a discussion at the very least!", "NTA - That's increased cost in utilities for 2 months, a bathroom that is occupied for 2 months, less space for 2 months, possibly more groceries for 2 months. It's entirely justified because fiance is making decisions without including you. \n\nIt's the type of thing you want to nip in the bud before she makes major life decisions without including you after you're married.", "NTA. That absolutely needed to be a conversation ahead of telling the friend they can move in.  2 months is a long time for a houseguest,  and that's if they leave", "NTA but she\u2019s shown you how she really regards you before the wedding. So that\u2019s handy ;)", "NTA - I don't know about you, but I'd sorta semi seriously considering moving out, were I put in the position you're in.", "You say that, but YOU were the one asking for info.", "You must be someone that answers the question \"where is the nearest gas station?\" with \"you should compliment the cashier's haircut\"", "You're not an AH. You just do you. Love ya!\n\nEdit: great book series."]}
