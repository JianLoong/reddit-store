A 1994 ford f150 that I restored and took with me to college, and a 1998 dodge ram which I bought as a total piece of junk, and rebuilt, painted, lifted etc. For my sisters 17th birthday I gave her the keys to my dodge, as the car my parents bought her barely ran half the time and constant nickel and dimed her money away. She still has this car she just doesnt drive it often. Keep in mind both these trucks are bought and paid for by me, titles are in my name only, and their on my insurance policy. \n\nThe agreement for Emma using my dodge was that she takes care of it, and pays me the insurance premium on the truck, (95 a month) the taking care of it part is what became the issue here. When I left I had just painted the truck, and redone the interior. The truck had no dents, no rust, etc it was as pristine as the truck was in 1998 when it was built. \n\nI came home for the holidays and found my truck completely trashed. The brand new seats were ripped, carpet was stained, trash everywhere in the cab, the passenger side headlight was busted, the fender dented, paint ruined on that fender, the brand new tires were bald in the rear (leading me to believe she was doing burnouts in it) this is over 1000 dollars in damage in the 4 months I have been out of state. I immediately took my keys back. Not only did she trash it, but she had not told me about the damage which i later discovered came from her driving drunk and hitting a mailbox. \n\nMy parents of course called me a dick for taking away her form of transportation but I feel I set pretty easy to follow boundaries, that she did not respect. I can handle an accident, but driving drunk, messing up the truck, and failing to tell me about it? I dont think I can forgive that along with let her continuing to use the truck. \n\nI have decided the truck is coming with me out of state. I flew in so I cancelled my flight back and am going to drive so I can 1 fix my truck, and 2 keep it with me as my university allows students as many vehicles as they need or want.\n\nSo reddit, AITA?\n\nClarification: My parents do not know she was drunk when she wrecked the truck. I\u2019m trying to figure out whether I want to tell them or not because shes going to be in some serious shit if I do. I found out since my best friends brother is dating her.\n\nUpdate: I spent all day driving my truck with my best friend, tucker, to body shops and junkyards around the area to find the parts my sister destroyed. I found a fender for 165 dollars, the leather to do my seats for 400 dollars, and ordered another set of headlights identical to the ones I had in it for 197 dollars. Along with that the quote to repaint the new fender is 600 dollars. I was able to get the stains out of the carpet with a carpet cleaner I rented for 30 dollars. Grand total  1,362 dollars. Along with that I told my parents about the driving drunk, to which Emma immediately ratted her boyfriend out as the one who drove it drunk and wrecked. She had apparently lied to them saying she told me about the damage and I didnt care. She is grounded, her car is being sold in order to pay me back and my parents are going to pay the difference and make her pay them back. They also told me to add the shop rate I used to charge when i worked on vehicles, so 140 an hour. So far in the fender replacement I have 2 hours, last time i did the interior it was 10 hours, and the headlights are also 2 hours. Grand total of 14 hours, which is 1,960 dollars, added on to the parts cost. My sister owes me 3,322 dollars, and Tucker informed his parents about his brother wrecking my truck, at which point his car, license, and all electronics were taken away.
