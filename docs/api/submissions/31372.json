Then she goes off abput how he's autistic and she can't control him and I'm going her dirty looks because he's autistic and it's not his fault.\n\nI responded that I didn't care what he'd got, she was being rude letting him climb all over our bags and over the back of our booth.

Honestly, from what OP is describing, it sounds like this woman was using autism as an excuse to do nothing and to not be held responsible for her child. That's pretty abhorrent behavior on her part.\n\n**ETA:** OP - you have every right to say something, you and your friend were being harangued by a child whose mother didn't seem to care about said child's behavior. You were understandably irritated and when it showed, you got a face full of attitude in return.  If I were you I probably would have just moved and if that wasn't an option, I'd have asked for assistance from the staff.", "NTA.

Autism or not, she\u2019s not doing her child any favors letting him get away with that behavior.", "NTA, I'm starting to wonder is \"my child is autistic waaaaaaaaaaah\" actually means \"imma lazy so and so and dont feel like being a parent and telling people my child is autistic when they are being out of control will make them feel/look bad for complaining\"", "NTA\n\nI'm a mom and my oldest has ADHD, there were times when she was very young that we'd have to up and leave places when she got too loud/hyper/whatever. No way were we going to let it ruin other's dining experiences. Could she help it at that age? No. But that doesn't mean that just because it wasn't something she could control we let it go. \n\nJust because a kid is ND doesn't excuse bad parenting and worse, using it as an excuse for bad parenting.", "NTA. Nothing is more annoying than entitled parents. As you said, a little sorry could have been nice. I don't think the child has done something wrong, but it sounds like the parent just used the child and their condition as an excuse to be rude and get away with insulting you.", "NTA - You did nothing wrong, she got confrontational over you looking annoyed in an undeniably annoying situation.", "Totally NTA! But realistically it\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault. Mom needs parenting classes.", "NTA and she was rude. As simple apology for disrupting others and a redirection of the kid is appropriate--autism or not. I'm sure the mother felt at the end of her rope, but there's play areas and then there's *other people's space and stuff* and they are not the same.\n\nShe was also way out of line to call you names for not being welcoming of the intrusion. Sure, it's McDonald's, and the kid can make noise and whatnot...but it's not a cage match (I hope).", "NTA- But the child's mom and the employee certainly are.\n\nThe mom needs to control her child. Autistic or not, she needs to parent her child and make sure he behaves, especially in public. And her calling you names was uncalled for.\n\nThe employee should've diffused the situation. This woman and her child were the ones causing a scene and they defended the bad parent over the person trying to enjoy their meal.", "NTA. There is NO EXCUSE for this behavior.

The woman should've taken control of her child and removed him as soon as it became clear he wasn't going to stop climbing all over you and trying to take food off of your table. Instead she made it your problem and that's not okay.\n\nThe fact she escalated this and started verbally abusing you shows she knew she was in the wrong but didn't want to accept responsibility.
