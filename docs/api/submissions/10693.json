Traditions are just peer pressure by dead people. Live life on your terms, not those that provided your genetic material.", "NTA\nJoining because of family tradition, seems to be the wrong reason. There's a lot of sacrifice and risk, and not just the killing and dying part.  You need to take care of yourself and make the right decisions for yourself.  Sounds like your bullying and abuse was extra hard, and not just the training.\n\nAlso, if your mother thinks it's so easy.  She should have joined, we have women in the military now too!  (Assuming you're in a Western country.)\n\nGiven the bullying you were getting from your own mom, I don't see that there was a better way to leave than what you did.

You can't be anyone else but yourself. You can't pretend to be your Father, grandfather, uncles, cousins or even the etc's.\n\nYou did the right thing for you, and that makes you NOT an asshole.", "NTA, I served, and not everyone makes it through basic.  Of those that didn't that I saw personally nearly everyone of them who bailed or washed out I felt their problem was they didn't want to be there, had joined for the wrong reasons.\n\nIf your hearts not in it, at least reasonably so its not a good career choice and bailing early is way better then trying to bail later.\n\nBeen a while since I've served but very few got beaten. Those who were either shaped up or found a door out. \n\nIf you had a time machine, I'd not enlist was the only 'mistake' you made IMO.  But I get that the family pressure got you too so that's not really on you.", "You\u2019re never TA for living your life as you see fit, as long as you\u2019re not hurting people, including yourself.

There are a lot of people who just shouldn't be in, and it's better that you found out early on. For you to be at the point where you were restricted from weapons, and they actually sent you to counseling (trying to get in to behavioral health is a nightmare) it shows that you were a serious risk to yourself. I'm really glad you got out before things got worse and you became another statistic. \n\nYou didn't disgrace your family, and I'm sorry that your mom put a family legacy before your wellbeing. You also handled it better than me; I would've asked why the hell SHE didn't join if it was so important.", "NTA. Your mom wasn\u2019t in the army, so she has no right to tell you that you\u2019re a disgrace. She wouldn\u2019t make it a day.

Ever since I could remember I wanted to join the army and be just like all my fathers.  I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s a tradition in my family that\u2019s just what all the men did. Well right after I graduated in 2014 I went to MEPS to join. I passed on everything except my astigmatism. I needed a waiver then they would allow my eyes to pass. Then I fell in love with my Ex. I gained weight, worked at Walmart, lived paycheck to paycheck. I regretted never joining. \n\nFast forward to 2018 and I\u2019m married and I considered joining again. I thought maybe this was my chance at redemption. In the next year I went to MEPS twice and failed my eyes and weight both times. I kept telling myself that I was gonna lose the weight. I kept telling myself I was going to give myself everything I deserved. Never happened, I would lose 20 pounds and then gain 15.  I\u2019d lose 30 then gain 40. An endless cycle of misery and telling myself a lie cause I wanted to believe it so bad. Eventually I gave up again. \n\nFast forward to present day and I\u2019m the healthiest and most in shape I\u2019ve ever been. I grew my hair out and got my ears pierced. Im the strongest I\u2019ve ever been. My wife and I are very happy together.  \n\nAll of this to say that not everyone has it and not everyone wants it. I wanted it for the wrong reasons. It wasn\u2019t until I decided I no longer wanted to join that my mental and physical health improved dramatically. \n\nYou are not pathetic or whatever anyone else tells you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The military is not for everyone. It is not some fix it for all, or a good way to get a college education for free if you don't think you should ever fight. It is not a cure-all for social problems. It sounds like your family is toxic, and you're better off being away from them.
