I highly suggest reevaluating this relationship. Super fuckin bold of her to pull somethin like this. Personally, i would have kicked her out yesterday. Maybe see if she can return those cats and look into hypoallergenic cats if there are any breeds that are actually that way? Crazy situation, sorry to hear about it", "NTA and how are you still living there? you need to break up with her and move. there are not enough antihistamines in the world that would make it okay for someone with a severe cat allergy to live in an apartment with one cat, much less two. she clearly does not love you enough to care about your wellbeing.", "Jeez. \n\nNo. Your partner is a nightmare. \n\nThis is how it\u2019s going to be from now on.

Then, to just get 2 cats and basically say just deal with it shows a ton of lack of respect for a person, let alone a partner.", "NTA, but under these circumstances, the cats appear to be a not so subtle hint that she wants you gone. I think you should oblige her. She's probably wondering why you're so slow getting the clue.", "NTA. I am also horribly allergic to cats and I lived in a house for a few weeks with one indoor cat. I had to be medicated constantly and still felt awful all the time. And I don't even have asthma. That sounds like an absolute nightmare. It is unfortunate she already got the cats because there are cats that cause way less histamine response. I actually have two cats now that cause very little allergic reaction. I flare up a bit if I pet them a lot, but mostly, it's not a problem.  Very manageable. More importantly, it was a decision my partner and I made together, with the understanding that we wouldn't bring animals into our home that caused one of us to feel like garbage all the time.", "NTA - I really do hate saying this OP, but it's either you or the cats at this point.  She showed absolutely no respect to your allergies (big red flag) and put you in a house of absolute despair.  You need to stand up for yourself or this is not going to end well for you.", "What a dumpster fire. Clearly NTA. You told her no. You told her you have allergies. You are literally suffering as a result. She did and does not care. \n\nI rarely suggest that people reconsider a relationship since compromises are almost always possible, but in this case I think you need to have a very serious conversation with your partner about her decision to get the cats. Ffs she has to see that you are suffering.", "NTA this is dealbreaker behavior. With this level of allergies they only get worse with constant contact with the contagion. If you have kids there's a good chance they'll have allergies too. Then what, they have to grow up sick because mom wants cats?\n\nI love cats to the point I would not date someone allergic but OP your girlfriend is an A.", "self respect dude. This person obviously doesnt give two shits about you", "NTA, she went and got not one but two cats even after repeatedly telling her not to and even after finding out you're allergic to them. She has no respect for you nor your health. Since she wants to keep the cats, she should find somewhere else to live because you can't live with the cats. Even with medication taking medication daily is never good.", "NTA, but it\u2019s a tough one. She needs to think about whether or not she can be with someone that doesn\u2019t ever want a pet. I couldn\u2019t. \nIt sounds like she started out ok with that and perhaps now is not. I don\u2019t know where she is with it, but if she came to the conclusion that she did want pets, the way to handle it would\u2019ve been to sit down and have that compatibility discussion.\nIf I were you, that\u2019s where I\u2019d take this. Sit her down and tell her that you can\u2019t live with cats and don\u2019t want pets, as you told her before she got the cats. Suggest that the two of you may simply not be compatible to live together. \nIt\u2019s totally fair and reasonable to discover that you\u2019re incompatible.

NTA", "I'm very allergic to cats. Nobody in my family takes it seriously. It sucks. Luckily we live on our own but I am essentially unable to attand any family events and everyone gets super butthurt about it. Idk how you can live like that. You have to be comfortable in your own home. And worse yet this may be some of the only time in your life you can feel content and comfortable. What if you get sick with cancer or a condition that makes you sick and in pain? Youre going to regret not enjoying your health and happiness now. She took that away from you for essentially no reason. You cant live like that indefinitely. And the allergy treatments are not cheap or easy or quick fyi.", "NTA. She\u2019s chosen cats over you. \nKnowing that your severely allergic and still went ahead with getting two is a shitty thing to do.", "NTA. Her lack of empathy for your situation should seriously alarm you.", "More than likely, she got the cats because she is passive-aggressively telling you to leave.", "NTA. Does she even like you?", "Who owns the place you both live in, or is named on the lease?", "NTA but you realize this is your cue to end the relationship, right? Your girlfriend doesn\u2019t give a shit about you. Her reasoning for getting the cats is spectacularly selfish.", "NTA, and tell her she can take her cats and GTFO. I am a cat person and love cats, but you don't buy a cat when you live with someone that is allergic to them.", "NTA - but if your health and wellbeing means so little to her then your relationship is doomed anyway. Allergies can be life threatening and medication does not always work or stop you feeling terrible. You may love her but she does not love you. Sorry but there you have it.", "NTA she is extremely selfish. I think you might want to find your own place if she can\u2019t rehome the cats so you can breathe.", "Pets are a two yes/one no situation. If one person does not want to live with a pet and the other person doesn\u2019t want to get over it, then they are incompatible.

After the last one passed away, he didn\u2019t want to get another one because we were having a baby. Baby is a little older and I absolutely want a ferret so bad, but he is not on board with it. And because of that, we don\u2019t have one now and probably won\u2019t until the kiddo is old enough to at least help feed it. I respect my husband enough not to bring another animal into our home without his consent. \n\n  You should be able to live in your house without feeling sick and drugged from allergies.

It sounds like you\u2019ve got it well managed now, but pollen season, a cold, or wildfire smoke could upset the current balance and get you really sick.", "Part of what annoys me about this is her decision to bring in the cat without a strong consensus, which now puts the cat into a risky situation where it might get tossed out. If OP is allergic and OP's partner is this uncaring about how she treats others, I'm worried she might not take the appropriate care to rehome the cat, if necessary.
