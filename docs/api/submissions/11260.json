I know I'm weird.\n\nI also don't like hearing profanity.  I know almost everyone else swears - that's fine, whatever.  But I don't normally police other people's speech.  People have a right to talk how they want.  But there are a few places where I feel I have the right to expect a profanity-free zone.  At work.  In my house.  *And* when members of my family are talking to me.  My feeling is, when it's my family, I don't think I'm asking too much for them to respect my wishes.  They know swearing makes me uncomfortable, and since they presumably love me, and don't want to make me uncomfortable, it wouldn't be a big deal to try and avoid vulgarity.\n\nA few days ago, my sister [F47] was emailing me about something that was very clearly emotionally upsetting.  She had been stewing on it for a while, and there happened to be a couple swear words mixed in the email.  I ignored them, thinking she was upset and it was a one-time thing.  But as we emailed back and forth, she continued to sprinkle her emails with occasional profanity, and they began getting slightly... worse?  Nothing *awful* - but I got the feeling that if I didn't say anything she would continue to do it.\n\nSo I emailed her back and said that while I knew she was upset, I was uncomfortable with profanity, and if she could please not use it around me.\n\nShe then got... mad?  She said she didn't feel like filtering her speech, and that I was focusing on a few words that I didn't like instead of the main idea, and that it was \"trivial\".  She said it was something I was going to have to get used to and not take personally.  That we'll have to \"agree to disagree\".\n\nI'm sorry - what?  How can I \"agree to disagree\" on what makes me uncomfortable?  Is it really that big a favor to ask your sister (not some stranger, not even a friend) not to swear while writing an email?  It's not even as if she's talking to me, and can't take back a word she spoke.  She's literally *writing* an email.  So what she's telling me is that I'm not worth the extra two minutes it would take to read over what she wrote and delete or change a few words?  It's apparently too much to ask of someone?\n\nBut maybe it is too much.  I recognize that I'm unusual in the fact that I don't swear.  And so maybe that blinds me to how much effort it would require someone to *not* swear.  So I ask you, Reddit - a community not exactly known for their clean vocabulary lol.  Am I asking too much of my sister?  Am I in fact, the AH?

YTA (that's required swearing so it doesn't count).  \n\nHere, you've essentially told your sister that your sensitivity to these words is more important to you than her feelings about an \"emotionally upsetting\" topic. In addition, swear words are not the only words that can hurt--unnecessary criticisms are \"bad\" words, too.  You want her to edit her emails to you, but you had no problem using your own words to tell her that (a) you weren't really listening to what she said, and (b) you're disappointed in her standards.  \n\nFocus on your own words and let others do the same. Save the objections for when people are truly using words to inflict harm.", "I understand it make you uncomfortable but at the end of the day your making her uncomfortable by not allowing her to express her distress. I think her comment of agree to disagree is more she an adult and doesn't have ti filter if she doesn't have to and you don't have to agree with her though on th subject I don't think anyone will win here", "YTA\n\n>They know swearing makes me uncomfortable, and since they presumably love me\n\nThis \"if you loved me, you'd....\" gives off manipulative vibes.\n\n>Am I asking too much of my sister?\n\nYou're asking someone to change their speech pattern because it offends you.  Yeah, it's crossing a line to try and dictate how someone talks, especially when it's your sister and an email, not an official workplace kind of environment.", "You\u2019re 45.  You\u2019re an adult.  Act like it.  Other people can make their own choices.  Also, grow up.", "YTA. Your behavior is childish. Even your post is written in an entitled way: \u201cI have the right to a profanity free zone with my family.\u201d Actually, it\u2019s not a \u201cright\u201d to police the way another adult expresses themselves, even if they are your sibling. And especially obnoxious and missing the point if your sister was talking about something upsetting that happened to her.", "YTA. She was *upset* about something and turning to you for emotional support and you decided to language police her. Why should she have to take extra time to edit her emails to YOUR preferences, especially in this instance?\n\nI might get your point if this was just a casual conversation, but it really comes across here that you put your preferences well above her hope for a single moment of empathy and comfort.", "YTA. She was upset about something serious, and you chose that moment to police her speech in a way that absolutely sounds petty. Swearing may make you uncomfortable, but I'm sure your attempts to control her language make her uncomfortable. Why is your comfort all that matters here?", "YTA\n\nYou being offended by profanity/simply disliking it is not your sisters problem. I could understand if you were asking her not to swear in front of kids, but you're a grown adult. You can choose to ignore the profanity throughout the conversation and leave it out of your vocabulary, but that doesn't mean that someone else should have to change the way they speak, just to please you. They're just words. \n\n>So what she's telling me is that I'm not worth the extra two minutes it would take to read over what she wrote and delete or change a few words? It's apparently too much to ask of someone?\n\nYou sound insecure. She probably didn't give the profanity a second thought, especially if that's how she usually speaks/writes. Not giving profanity any extra thought doesn't mean you're not worth an extra two minutes. It means your sister doesn't want to change the way she speaks. If she can respect the fact that you, yourself, don't swear, then why can you accept the fact that she does and call it a day?", "YTA. She is an adult and you can't police her language, especially not in an email. It would be one thing to ask that in your home around minor children, for instance. But she can cuss in an email. It makes her just as uncomfortable to be told how to talk as if she's still in grade school.", "YTA. She tried to end the disagreement amicably. You're the one dragging this out because your sensibilities were offended. Big whoop. There are worse things in the world than reading a few cuss words, especially when someone is upset and trying to vent. So be an adult and let it go.", "Do you know how exhausting it is to always police your own speech? Especially when you are upset? YTA. she clearly is going through something and you made it all about you, even when she tried to end the argument", "Yta prime example of what we can control vs what we cannot control. \n\nYou don't like swearing? Great! Don't swear!  You don't get to tell someone else to not swear though.\n\nIf your sister came to you and said 'hey I'm uncomfortable with you immodestly you dress, I want you to wear floor length dresses with high collars and long sleeves but don't worry I'll pay for your new wardrobe!\"  You wouldn't care that when was paying for it.", "YTA and your comments make clear that this about way more than swearing.\n\nYou and your sister are estranged. You both are trying to reconnect but you find your sister\u2019s tone and word choice to be so different from the sister you remember that it\u2019s causing disconnect. You were hoping her removing swear words from her language would help you bridge the gap between who you expected her to be and who she chose to become.\n\nThat\u2019s a lot to unpack.\n\nWhen your sister needed to work through something serious she turned you. And yet your feelings about swearing were so strong that you couldn\u2019t put them aside to be there for your sister.\n\nThere\u2019s obviously more to your feelings about swearing then simply not liking them. I hope you feel comfortable exploring that when you\u2019re ready in the real world.", "YTA\n\nWho died and made you Queen of all your Sisters?", "YTA \ud83d\ude02 it\u2019s just words get over it", "YTA. You are being judgemental instead of acknowledging that she is truly upset. You could have skimmed over the words and ignored them. You are so comfortable  and preachy with your uniqueness that you are putting your wants before your sister's needs. Get over yourself, you're not that special. Don't make everything about yourself.", "You are allowed to not like swearing. You even aren\u2019t an asshole for kindly, respectfully asking people to not swear in your personal home. But in general, yeah, YTA for expecting others to police their speech for your comfort.", "I don't really even understand your position here.\n\nY definitely TA\n\nI don't like drinking alcohol so I don't drink.\nI'm unbothered by other adults consumption of alcohol because it would be obnoxious to force folks to only do things I liked.\n\nThis is just weird.", "A word shouldn't have this much impact on you. Were you heavily punished for using them when you were younger? I don't really get why they're \"bad\" or \"cuss\" words, they aren't special, and it feels like an old out of date view, you can't go anywhere without hearing a cuss here or there, I mean, it's not like she's cussing you out and berating you with them, she's just using them in casual language, there's no harm there, and I think it shouldn't be her job to change her vocabulary over it, you should definitely look into figuring out why it makes you so uncomfortable, it's like telling someone not to use the word \"the\" because it makes you uncomfortable it just feels controlling and for someone who uses those words regularly it can be hard to not slip here or there.", "YTA- I understand you are uncomfortable with profanity, and you are entitled to avoiding it within your own power (through your own speech, choice in media, entertainment, etc.). However, that does not entitle you to police/correct/request others to follow your preferences. Cussing isn\u2019t putting you in any true harm, you just don\u2019t like it. There isn\u2019t a profanity allergy or disability or law to consider or be mindful of. \n\nIf people are using  profanity toward you (I.e., calling you names/insulting you using profanity)-for sure take offense and ask them to not speak like that to you. If they are using at or around you (like as a noun/verb/adjective/adverb) in basic conversation, your sister is right- that\u2019s something you need to get over. \n\nPeople have a right to cuss just as much as you have a right not too. It goes both ways.", "YTA, because you didn't just ask, you feel *entitled.* \n\nYour sister could just as easily write: \"I feel that I have a right to fully express myself when I'm emotional when I'm talking to my family.\" She could write \"I confided in my sister about something really upsetting that has been bothering me for a long time, and I used some swear words when writing to her about this situation--again, something that is really upsetting and that I've been holding in for a long time. She wrote back and basically just \"I know you're upset but I don't like profanity.\" I wasn't even saying the words near her-- she was literally just reading an email. I know she reads books that contain swear words and even posts on a subreddit with a swear word in the title! So what she's telling me is I'm not worth just dealing with a few emails with curse words in them and actually providing a substantive and empathetic response to the very emotionally upsetting issue I've been dealing with? It's apparently too much to ask of someone?\" \n\nI honestly barely even notice when I'm swearing because they're...just words? They're part of how I express myself? You can say truly horrible things without using a single profanity, and loving or wholesome or utterly anodyne things with lots of profanity. If someone isn't swearing at you, yes, it's a lot to ask to have them cull a ton of words in mainstream use from their vocabulary because you don't like them. And it sounds like it's *all* \"profanity\"-- what's considered profanity isn't even universal or regionally consistent! I'm sorry, I think it is a really unreasonable ask, especially from someone in the kind of emotional state your sister was.", "Soft YTA. Your sister was upset and you chose to make it about yourself and what makes you \"uncomfortable\"? Suck it up and be a good sister.", "YTA. You told her you don't care about what she was unhappy about, just about your comforts. You get to have a \"if you are swearing I will end the conversation\" boundary, but not a \"you can't swear around me\" rule outside your own house. She is a grown adult and gets to decide how she will speak or write.", "Why does your comfort trump the way she speaks normally? If it makes her uncomfortable to have to change how she speaks around you (which it likely would if it\u2019s part of how she expresses herself with those she\u2019s comfortable with) then why does your comfort take precedence?  She even tried to end the argument amicably but you went straight back on the attack and doubled down. I\u2019d have said N A H if you hadn\u2019t carried on after she tried to agree to disagree. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to swear or like it but you don\u2019t get to dictate other peoples way of speaking. In some places it\u2019s almost cultural to swear in day to day conversations and asking someone to change that to suit your needs, especially when they\u2019re clearly upset and venting. Then doubled down when she tried to end it there kinda makes YTA. \n\nIs this really the hill you want to die on? She and your family not swearing as an insult to you, they are swearing as that\u2019s how most people express frustration or even just in general conversation to emphasise their point. The whole \u201cif they love me they\u2019d do it\u201d vibe isn\u2019t great, it could easily be flipped \u201cif you loved them you wouldn\u2019t make such a big deal out of something so small when you know you\u2019re weird for doing it\u201d and be there for them like in the case of your sister - she was venting while upset to you the last thing on her mind was walking on eggshells over which words you\u2019d class as a swear. \n\nIf this is really such a big deal for you and you\u2019re going to keep on at it, you will find they may likely  not speak to you as much to avoid offending you. As I said you don\u2019t have to like swearing but they don\u2019t have to watch what they say when none of the swearing is directed as an insult at you. Maybe find some non-sweary friends? I\u2019m sure there will be some groups out there with no swear policies where you can interact with people who have similar views and take a break from how your family speaks rather than police it.", "YTA. Words have the power we give them.  One word is no worse or offensive than the next unless you make it so.  They may be saying words that you are uncomfortable hearing but they are comfortable saying.  Those words may best describe exactly how they feel or think at that moment.  By expecting them to censor their words you are censoring them and demeaning them.  If you believe that speech is a basic human right then you are saying someone who uses language you are uncomfortable with doesn\u2019t have that right.  You are not the arbiter of language.  You don\u2019t have the right to tell others how they must express themselves.\n\nI agree it is jarring to me when every other word is \u201cfuck\u201d. But it is also annoying when every other word is \u201cummm\u201d or \u201cgoes\u201d.  But I would never be critical of someone for saying \u201cummm\u201d too much.\n\nYour sister was upset and used the language that relayed her frustration.  If I was her I would have told you to go to hell and just stoped talking to you.", "**** your ******* entitlement op. don\u2019t worry, i filtered the bad words out for you \ud83d\ude09", "https://health.clevelandclinic.org/swearing-and-intelligence/amp/", "It's fine to ask but you have to accept the answer. I'm Australian so I use very intense swear words basically as punctuation, it's standard here in social settings. But if I'm with someone who isn't comfortable with it I don't swear at all. I'm not obligated to do that but I care about how they feel when they're with me and I want them to be comfortable. \n\nSo you don't have a right to expect/ demand it, but you absolutely have the right to request it and take their response as an indication of their level of concern for your wellbeing and comfort.

Nothing *awful* - but I got the feeling that if I didn't say anything she would continue to do it.\n\nSo I emailed her back and said that while I knew she was upset, I was uncomfortable with profanity, and if she could please not use it around me.\n\nShe then got... mad?  She said she didn't feel like filtering her speech, and that I was focusing on a few words that I didn't like instead of the main idea, and that it was \"trivial\".  She said it was something I was going to have to get used to and not take personally.  That we'll have to \"agree to disagree\".\n\nI'm sorry - what?  How can I \"agree to disagree\" on what makes me uncomfortable?  Is it really that big a favor to ask your sister (not some stranger, not even a friend) not to swear while writing an email?  It's not even as if she's talking to me, and can't take back a word she spoke.  She's literally *writing* an email.  So what she's telling me is that I'm not worth the extra two minutes it would take to read over what she wrote and delete or change a few words?  It's apparently too much to ask of someone?\n\nBut maybe it is too much.  I recognize that I'm unusual in the fact that I don't swear.  And so maybe that blinds me to how much effort it would require someone to *not* swear.  So I ask you, Reddit - a community not exactly known for their clean vocabulary lol.

It probably has roots in your thinking, deep down, that you are right about swearing and they are wrong, so it's a fair thing for you to ask.

Maybe I need to take a step back and disengage.  She was reaching out mainly at the request of our mother, and because I had expressed a desire to be closer.

And I can't ask her, because she's the kind of person who would lie to spare my feelings and say \"What are you talking about?  Me emailing you has NOTHING to do with Mom\" even though our mother might have made five dozen calls to her house telling her to contact me.\n\nOur mother really, really, *really* wants us to be close lol.", "You talk to her when she is not trying to vent. You have an open discussion. And no, demanding she not curse because you \u201cdislike it\u201d is not an open discussion. It is incredibly rude to expect somebody to just change their speech patterns and you either accept her as she is or you are not going to be capable of having a true relationship with her, nothing more than superficial"]}
