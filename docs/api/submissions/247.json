{"id": 247, "submission_id": "yi6g2n", "title": "AITA for refusing to gift my cousin a bike for Christmas", "selftext": "So I f(24) belong in a middle class family. When I was young, I was really jealous of other kids having a bike so I used to begged my parents to give me one for Christmas or my birthday but they didn't because they said it would cause me a lot of injuries just like what happened to my brother cause when our parents bought him a bike he had a lot of injuries. Now that I am an adult and independent to buy whatever I want, 3 months ago I bought my very first bike. The bike is expensive and I also brought gears for safety measures. Since I have a work I don't oftenly use my bike. So every weekend is the only time I use my bike. I don't really use it much cause I've only been practicing how to ride it. My cousin M (14)  live close 2 us so he oftenly visit our house and use my bike. I don't really have a problem with it but it just concerns me about he's safety as my mom keep telling me that he'll be gone for hours roaming to places using my bike. One day, we were celebrating our aunt's birthday at her house, I was just chilling watching Netflix movies along with my other relatives when this cousin came to me and ask me what I'll be giving him this Christmas. I didn't said what I be giving him for this Christmas cause I haven't thought about it but I will be giving him something. He then said that he wants me to gift him a bike cause back in there home he just borrows his friends bike and is really jealous of them. I didn't agree to gift him a bike but them his mother ( my aunt) came along to our conversation and told me to just gift him my bike cause I'm to old to have one and doesn't really use it much cause I have work and I'm planning to buy a car. I then again said no cause why should it be me to gift him a bike for Christmas. Though I can afford to buy him one, there is just a thought of mine saying that if my 14 yrs old self didn't have a bike as a gift why would I gift a bike for Christmas.\n\nNow my aunt and other relatives thinks that I'm a selfish brat and an asshole.

Because you would've loved to have one. But other than that, bikes are expensive. It's out of line to ask you to gift him one. And even more to ask you to gift him yours. Your aunt sounds very entitled. Why doesent she buy him one? Also the argument that you're too old doesent make any sense at all. You're never to old to ride a bike.", "NTA Tell all the relatives complaining that they could easily team up and buy him a bike. You are not their ATM. You won't be pressured into buying the present his parents should be buying him.\n\nIf your cousin is agreeing with all this and acting entitled I wouldn't let him ride your bike at all from now on.", "To old to have a bike. In the netherlands you ride till you die.", "NTA. You aren\u2019t his parent. If other people have issues with it then they can buy him the bike. I\u2019d honestly not give him anything, he sounds very entitled.", "NTA. Recipients don't get to decide what they are given, and nobody is entitled to your property.", "NTA, not your responsibility to give your cousin a bike. First he shouldn't even expect one from you, and it was super super rude of your aunt to tell you to give your bike to him, even if you barely use it, it's your bike and can do what you like with it. Your aunt herself or the relatives complaining should get her son a bike, not expect you to.", "NTA\n\nYou're not responsible for buying your cousin such a huge Christmas present (or really, any present at all, but something in the $20 range is typically sufficient for a first cousin). Surely a bike is the *parents'* responsibility.\n\nAnd I'd stop letting the entitled brat use your bike *all*, at the very least until I received an apology from your aunt for the \"too old to have one\" and \"selfish brat\" remarks. Get a good lock and chain and keep the key with you at all times.", "NTA - \n\nYour 14yo cousin asking you to gift him a bicycle for Christmas also NTA\n\nYour aunt \"telling\" you to give him your bike because you are too old to have one, major ah.\n\nThat being said, if you can afford it, why not give your cousin a bike so you could bike together on weekends, something you couldn't do at his age?  Make it a bonding experience with your young relative.", "NTA. Your parents claimed they wouldn\u2019t buy you a bike because you might get hurt. Nobody seems to use that excuse about the cousin\u2014 as long as they aren\u2019t the ones buying him an expensive item like that, they don\u2019t care. tbh, I think you should stop letting the cousin use your bike so much. He and his mother are too darned entitled, imho, and you need to nip that entitlement in the bud.  You can always gift him money for him to add to his saving toward a bike if you feel so inclined.", "You are not responsible for getting him anything you don't want to. But your logic is what I'm struggling with. It comes off as \"I had to suffer without a bike, so he should too.\" However, you know how much it sucked to not have one. You could save him from having to feel like you did at his age. It's not your job to worry about his safety; that's his parents job and his mom sounds okay with it. I do think it is presumptuous and rude that they are asking you to buy one though. Maybe ask his mom privately if she is planning on getting him that bike for Christmas because you are interested in getting him a helmet and water bottle for it.\n\nNTA", "NTA for not giving him a bike.  He has a mom, she can get him one.   He also has no right to demand any gift from you.   His mom is being a definite AH, telling you what you should give him and that you are too old (My grandfather still rode a bike around his town when he was 88 years old!)\n\nBut you are being a bit of an AH with your attitude of \"I couldn't have one, he shouldn't either.\"   There are lots of good reasons for saying no--that sounds like jealousy at the thought he might have something you did not, and that's a pretty AH attitude.\n\nI am also very curious as to what exactly your family has been doing that they have so many injuries from biking?   Unless you're getting into some pretty extreme biking, it's a pretty safe hobby that generally doesn't lead to any more injuries than other normal active hobbies among kids and adults.    Or is it just that they don't really have any active hobbies so it just seems like the bike is less safe?", "NTA\n\nWhat you give others is up to you. Also: you are definitely allowed to have a bike. Biking is a great hobby, healthy and quite liberating.\n\nWhat that is said: if nobody pressured you and asked for it, would you have considered buying your cousin a bike? You clearly remember what it was like to want one, and he clearly enjoys biking a LOT - would it be nice to give this gift to a younger relative?", "NTA for not giving your property as a gift. \n\nThe bit about \"I suffered so he should have to as well\" is definitely a dick move; so is a huge wall of text when you're old enough to know better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
