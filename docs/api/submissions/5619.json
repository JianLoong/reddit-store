She is always going to be the one that got away in his mind. \n\nMIL called Derek pissed last night as he did some prank on the twins with an elf on the shelf and they wouldn't sleep. She demanded he come over and deal with what he did, so Derek did come over and try to help her get them to sleep, but Derek is an idiot so when I went to bed at like 1 am the kids were running and jumping on furniture. \n\nWell I woke up at seven and the kids were looking for their gifts and pissed about santa being late, so I went and knocked on MIL's door and she said to come in. She was in bed with Derek. I told her the twins were up, she thanked me, and I went back to what I was doing. \n\nThen I got a social media message from Annie saying she had been contacting Derek for hours and was worried. She called my phone right after and I was honest and said he was in MIL's room and I would go and get him. Well Annie flipped shit and came over.\n\nShe tried coming in to confront MIL but MIL wouldn't let her in. Derek went outside and they were screaming in the yard while the twins were trying to open gifts. Both kids kept getting distracted. Then Annie was banging on the door. Derek finally got back in the house and was an emotional wreck. MIL got mad at him for ruining Christmas and grabbed the twins and locked herself in her bedroom. Derek proceeded to sit on the couch and drink.\n\nWell MIL found out that I told Annie the in bed part and blew up on me about how I'm a self righteous bitch, I have more pity for Annie than the woman housing me, and I ruined her kids Christmas.

MIL and ex were the ones who ruined Christmas", "NTA. You are not a co-conspirator in their shit show. Annie asked you a question. You answered simply and honestly. If MIL and Derek didn't want Christmas ruined they shouldn't have done EVERYTHING THAT THEY DID to ruin it. Some people just can't handle that there are consequences to their behavior. But you should be prepared for the consequences to your's being that you are getting kicked out, best case scenario.", "You're NTA for telling Annie the truth, as someone that has been cheated on and had everyone that knew keep quiet I thank you on behalf of Annie, I wish someone told me. \n\nWith that said I don't think today was the day to let her in on it, I personally would have ignored her call, gone and told Derek that if he didn't talk to his wife you would and you wouldn't be lying for them. Let him deal with that for the day, let the kids have a calm Christmas, then blow shit up tomorrow. But no matter what you could never be TA for outing a lying cheater.", "did you do the right thing? yes. did you ruin Christmas? no. can you keep living there and are you going to ever have a good relationship with your MIL again? nope and nope.", " Personally that sounds like a super fun Christmas.

I hope OP get some when she is out of their drama sh*t...", "I think he thought marrying a 21 year old would jar MIL into action. I legit think he thought she was going to run in and stop him at the altar.", "They both have some issues. He was so spoiled as a child that his parents ruined him, zero impulse control and substance issues (now clean). MIL lashes out a lot and is irrational due to some CPTSD and he was a spoiled rich boy who had no idea how to deal with it. She was spiraling due to her own stuff so he gave the job she really wanted (she's always worked for his family) to someone else because he didn't think she could handle it and she never forgave him. Also they had an open marriage (her idea) and he seemed to have changed his mind but never communicated that and just got more and more jealous", "He was right there.

Please tell me Annie doesn't have children with Derek. She needs to pack his stuff and dump it at MIL. Maybe you can go stay with Annie. Imo, Mil wanted you to see Derek in her bed.", "Wow what a cluster fuck! NTA", "Messy. All of y\u2019all are too old to be this damn messy.", "NTA. You did Annie a favor. MIL is a lot?? Yes a whole lot. A home wrecker. MIL and Derek take the AH awards here. Getting kicked out might be a blessing in disguise. Wow. Get out of there if you can. Good luck.", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nObviously you re an AH and a toxic guest ... and about to be homeless for it.", "It gave us a Christmas present! Even added twins!", "The MIL troll also enjoys inventing twins.", "zero substance issues but he immediately started drinking after this went down ?\n\ni\u2019m hoping you and your husband can get out of this environment soon, op."]}
