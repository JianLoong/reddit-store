She's very independent and never asks my husband and I for anything, so we wanted to do something nice for her. \n\nShe mentioned to my a while ago that she really wanted this bag and was planning to save up for it. The bag goes for around $2000usd. Knowing this my husband and I decided to surprise her with it as an early graduation gift. She was very, very grateful for the bag.\n\nLast weekend we went to my FIL's birthday dinner at his house. Maria wore her bag, we didn't think anything of it. My SIL and niece (also 18F) attended as well. \n\nI all of a sudden hear a bunch of shouting from upstairs so I go upstairs to see what's wrong. My MIL and SIL follow me.

My husband tells her to hand it over twice, she refuses, so he grabs it from her with force.\n\nSIL starts losing her shit saying \"do not snatch thing's from my daughter\" etc etc. I tell her to piss off and get her daughter under control. She calls me an AH for letting my daughter \"flaunt\" her designer bag in front of her daughter. My MIL took SIL's side and said that it was inconsiderate of Maria to bring the bag here, when my niece doesn't have one to relate to Maria with.\n\nI called them all unhinged and my husband and I left.

These people are delusional!  What did she think was going to happen? They'd just give up and let her keep the bag? Seriously, WTF?\n\nAlso, the niece is in for a rude awakening if she goes to college. There will be well-off people around her who have designer things and she won't be able to just steal them because she \"wants it.\"", "NTA. Sounds like your SIL is raising a monster.", "NTA - I\u2019d expect an out of control, poorly parented 8-year-old to lock themselves in the bathroom over a toy they didn\u2019t have. An 18-year-old pulling that kind of stunt? That is crazy. \n\nThe only thing I would have done differently is threatened to call the police rather than physically taking the bag back, because you are right, the behavior is unhinged, but it wasn\u2019t worth your husband getting into a physical altercation over it. If he had accidentally hurt the niece trying to get the bag back, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they would have tried to sue your family, especially since they seem to think they are entitled to your money.", "NTA\n\nThat was a graduation gift. Your neice took another person's property without permission.", "NTA. Your niece is 18 years old and acting like this ??? You are not entitled to buy anyone anything and your daughter earned that bag. Definitely don't bring expensive things around your niece again not because you're \"flaunting\" it but because she sounds like she may try to steal/ruin them", "NTA - Niece's behavior is clearly out of line and more in line with a 3 year old than an 18 year old. SIL is obviously where she gets this outrageous behavior from and SIL is obviously entitled and jealous.", "Clearly NTA. You need to buy the niece something to have equally so she doesn't feel bad? Is simply wearing something nice considered \"flaunting\"? The world has gone crazy. It's also so disrespectful to steal something and run away with it how old is she? I'm guessing a child", "NTA - Wearing it is not the same as flaunting it. And even if she was being a jerk about having it - that does not give niece the right to try and steal something that is not hers. It is important for parents to teach their kids to not be so envious of others, we all have things other people don't whether they be physical or intangible and that's okay, be grateful for what you have and work for what you want. Sounds like SIL failed in that lesson and this opportunity to teach it.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband needs to take care of his asshole mother, his asshole sister, and his asshole, criminal niece. They are awful people.\n\nWhile as a general rule, those who have should exercise a modest amount of restraint in front of those who don't, a graduation gift earned by special achievements isn't required to be hidden away, nor is one required to provide equal gifts to less-fortunate relatives. Certainly, one is not required to accede to theft or blackmail. \n\nThough perhaps you could offer all of them jobs landscaping and shoveling snow for some extra cash. Just don't let them inside, since they seem to think stealing is okay.", "NTA. You're correct about them being unhinged. They are not worth your family's time. Let that relationship go until they apologize.", "NTA. I'd put niece, SIL and MIL on a NC list till they get some therapy. You owe them nothing.", "I\u2019ve watched one-too many shows on the ID Channel because the OP\u2019s niece sounds like she could be the type to befriend wealthy people just so she can scam them.\n\nNTA.", "Wow NTA your MIL and SIL and the kid are indeed unhinged. That is not normal behavior in any way shape or form. She wasn't flaunting it but using a bag she was given as a gift. Absurd that the niece thinks she can just take it because she wants it. Thief in the making.", "NTA - MIL and SIL clearly are A Hs here and enablers for terrible behavior.  Unless your niece is 2 years old she is also.\n\nYour husband needs to step up and tell his family to STFU and they need to apologize or he gets put in the same category as MIL / SIL / Niece.\n\nIf nothing improves with your ILs, agree to send an apology.  Go book an over the top vacation and send an apology video showing where you are staying and tell them that you are sorry that they can't join you at X and you are sorry they are A Hs and go NC.", "Jesus Christ what a messed up family. \n\nNo YNTA. Your in laws are deluded. Your niece needs to learn not to touch other people's things. \n\nWhat's your daughter meant to do leave the bag at home incase she bumps into her cousin in the town etc? \n\nYou don't owe anything to the family just because you bought your daughter it. Niece could get a job or her mom could save up for nice gifts for her too. She's not your responsibility.", "NTA. What kind of delusional AH is your SIL and why is your MIL taking her side?! Cut off contact until they apologize and call out SIL for raising such a brat of a daughter.", "NTA. The fact the bag was away clearly shows that it wasn\u2019t being \u2018flaunted\u2019 or showing off. You wanted to do something nice for your daughter as a early graduation present, there is nothing wrong with that or your daughter bringing it with her.", "NTA. You poor guys! You're surrounded by AHs. Literally, SWIMMING in AHs.", "NTA wtf. Your family sucks.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL and niece need a major wake up call. It's clear that they are extremely entitled. Your niece seems to be the very definition of that entitled brat from charlie and the chocolate factory. but instead of \"Daddy I want it\" its \"mommy I want it\"", "This is one of those occasions where you could have acted significantly worse and still been NTA. Cut 'em off. You don't need those assholes in your life.", "You are most definitely NTA. Your sister in law is very entitled for her to demand that whatever you buy your daughter you buy your niece. This is YOUR money, you spend it however you want. You and your husband spent your lives building good careers for yourselves and are now living the life you built for yourselves. Your SIL had the same opportunity to do that for her kids and didn\u2019t, that\u2019s not your fault. You buy whatever you want for your family without apologies. You should never have to apologize for buying nice things for your kids! You are doing amazing job as parents!", "NTA - Good grief I had to read that twice to check your niece's age, that's behaviour you would expect from an extremely spoiled 8 year old, not 18.\n\nWhat you choose to buy your daughter is no one else's business but your own. Your in-law's behaviour was disgusting, you do not need to pander to your niece, though I would simply stop interacting with them, if they don't see your family they cannot be upset by what your daughter has.\n\nThe only - slight - criticism I would have is that your husband shouldn't have grabbed the bag, they sound deranged enough to accuse him of assault. Instead, you should have told her that if they didn't hand the bag back then you were going to report the bag as stolen to the police. And if they had still refused you should have followed through.", "It's unfortunate that the child and parents, obviously are having jealousy issues but you're NTA for your actions OP.", "NTA. This is ridiculous behavior from your SIL and your in-laws. You and your family are doing better financially and your daughter has a beautiful designer bag. So what? It doesn\u2019t give your niece any right to take it away from her, to lock herself in a bathroom because she \u201cwants it\u201d, and for your family to blame you for having better things. Your husband could have managed his anger, I have to say, because he stooped to the level of a 17 year old girl. He cannot go in and wrestle a bag like that. There are more mature ways to handle it. But you\u2019re not the asshole here.", "NTA.\n\nI kinda feel for the niece. She's probably very aware of the wealth disparity. I would not be shocked if the barb about all the money you guys have is one her mom has been repeating to her since she was young(er). So she made a really bad and probably impulsive decision, and it doesn't sound like she has great role models.\n\nThat said, it was still a really bad decision! I hope she can learn from this, even if her mom and gma seem determined to make it your fault. Which it isn't, by the way.\n\nEdit to remove a line, I thought niece was younger than she is.", "NTA. While I question the wisdom or logic in spending $2,000 on a purse for an 18 year old and if you had asked about that I might have called you the AH, you are not the AH for what happened at your MILs house and you owe no one an apology.  This assumes your daughter merely had her purse with her and she wasn\u2019t showing off, drawing attention to it or bragging about how much it costs.  If she was then she is the AH along with her cousin\n\nBut assuming she didn\u2019t do any of that, by the time you are 18 you should realize that there are people who have more than you and people who have less.  Life isn\u2019t fair that way.  And there is nothing you can do about it but appreciate what you have and be gracious about it. Your niece evidently hasn\u2019t figured this out b because she acted like she was an 8 year old throwing a temper tantrum.
