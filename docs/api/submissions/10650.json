She's very independent and never asks my husband and I for anything, so we wanted to do something nice for her. \n\nShe mentioned to my a while ago that she really wanted this bag and was planning to save up for it. The bag goes for around $2000usd. Knowing this my husband and I decided to surprise her with it as an early graduation gift. She was very, very grateful for the bag.\n\nLast weekend we went to my FIL's birthday dinner at his house. Maria wore her bag, we didn't think anything of it. My SIL and niece (also 18F) attended as well. \n\nI all of a sudden hear a bunch of shouting from upstairs so I go upstairs to see what's wrong. My MIL and SIL follow me.

My niece had taken the bag from where we leave our jackets and bags and Maria realized she locked herself in the bathroom. \n\nSIL tells Maria to stop overacting and wait for niece to come out. I tell SIL to tell her child to open the door and give Maria her bag back. SIL refuses and doesn't see the big deal. \n\nI call my husband, he starts having a go at my SIL after he finds out what's going on and grabs something to pick the lock on the door with. \n\nWe get the door open and my niece is refusing to give the bag back because \"she wants it\". My husband tells her to hand it over twice, she refuses, so he grabs it from her with force.\n\nSIL starts losing her shit saying \"do not snatch thing's from my daughter\" etc etc. I tell her to piss off and get her daughter under control. She calls me an AH for letting my daughter \"flaunt\" her designer bag in front of her daughter. My MIL took SIL's side and said that it was inconsiderate of Maria to bring the bag here, when my niece doesn't have one to relate to Maria with.\n\nI called them all unhinged and my husband and I left.

These people are delusional!  What did she think was going to happen? They'd just give up and let her keep the bag? Seriously, WTF?\n\nAlso, the niece is in for a rude awakening if she goes to college. There will be well-off people around her who have designer things and she won't be able to just steal them because she \"wants it.\"", "NTA. Sounds like your SIL is raising a monster.", "NTA - I\u2019d expect an out of control, poorly parented 8-year-old to lock themselves in the bathroom over a toy they didn\u2019t have. An 18-year-old pulling that kind of stunt? That is crazy. \n\nThe only thing I would have done differently is threatened to call the police rather than physically taking the bag back, because you are right, the behavior is unhinged, but it wasn\u2019t worth your husband getting into a physical altercation over it. If he had accidentally hurt the niece trying to get the bag back, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they would have tried to sue your family, especially since they seem to think they are entitled to your money.", "NTA\n\nThat was a graduation gift. Your neice took another person's property without permission.", "NTA. Your niece is 18 years old and acting like this ??? You are not entitled to buy anyone anything and your daughter earned that bag. Definitely don't bring expensive things around your niece again not because you're \"flaunting\" it but because she sounds like she may try to steal/ruin them", "NTA - Niece's behavior is clearly out of line and more in line with a 3 year old than an 18 year old. SIL is obviously where she gets this outrageous behavior from and SIL is obviously entitled and jealous.", "Clearly NTA. You need to buy the niece something to have equally so she doesn't feel bad? Is simply wearing something nice considered \"flaunting\"? The world has gone crazy. It's also so disrespectful to steal something and run away with it how old is she? I'm guessing a child", "NTA - Wearing it is not the same as flaunting it. And even if she was being a jerk about having it - that does not give niece the right to try and steal something that is not hers. It is important for parents to teach their kids to not be so envious of others, we all have things other people don't whether they be physical or intangible and that's okay, be grateful for what you have and work for what you want. Sounds like SIL failed in that lesson and this opportunity to teach it.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband needs to take care of his asshole mother, his asshole sister, and his asshole, criminal niece. They are awful people.\n\nWhile as a general rule, those who have should exercise a modest amount of restraint in front of those who don't, a graduation gift earned by special achievements isn't required to be hidden away, nor is one required to provide equal gifts to less-fortunate relatives. Certainly, one is not required to accede to theft or blackmail. \n\nThough perhaps you could offer all of them jobs landscaping and shoveling snow for some extra cash. Just don't let them inside, since they seem to think stealing is okay.", "NTA. You're correct about them being unhinged. They are not worth your family's time. Let that relationship go until they apologize.", "NTA. I'd put niece, SIL and MIL on a NC list till they get some therapy. You owe them nothing.", "I\u2019ve watched one-too many shows on the ID Channel because the OP\u2019s niece sounds like she could be the type to befriend wealthy people just so she can scam them.\n\nNTA.", "Wow NTA your MIL and SIL and the kid are indeed unhinged. That is not normal behavior in any way shape or form. She wasn't flaunting it but using a bag she was given as a gift. Absurd that the niece thinks she can just take it because she wants it. Thief in the making.", "NTA - MIL and SIL clearly are A Hs here and enablers for terrible behavior.  Unless your niece is 2 years old she is also.\n\nYour husband needs to step up and tell his family to STFU and they need to apologize or he gets put in the same category as MIL / SIL / Niece.\n\nIf nothing improves with your ILs, agree to send an apology.  Go book an over the top vacation and send an apology video showing where you are staying and tell them that you are sorry that they can't join you at X and you are sorry they are A Hs and go NC.", "Jesus Christ what a messed up family. \n\nNo YNTA. Your in laws are deluded. Your niece needs to learn not to touch other people's things. \n\nWhat's your daughter meant to do leave the bag at home incase she bumps into her cousin in the town etc? \n\nYou don't owe anything to the family just because you bought your daughter it. Niece could get a job or her mom could save up for nice gifts for her too. She's not your responsibility.", "NTA. What kind of delusional AH is your SIL and why is your MIL taking her side?! Cut off contact until they apologize and call out SIL for raising such a brat of a daughter.", "NTA. The fact the bag was away clearly shows that it wasn\u2019t being \u2018flaunted\u2019 or showing off. You wanted to do something nice for your daughter as a early graduation present, there is nothing wrong with that or your daughter bringing it with her.", "NTA. You poor guys! You're surrounded by AHs. Literally, SWIMMING in AHs.", "NTA wtf. Your family sucks.", "NTA\n\nYour SIL and niece need a major wake up call. It's clear that they are extremely entitled. Your niece seems to be the very definition of that entitled brat from charlie and the chocolate factory. but instead of \"Daddy I want it\" its \"mommy I want it\"", "This is one of those occasions where you could have acted significantly worse and still been NTA. Cut 'em off. You don't need those assholes in your life.", "You are most definitely NTA. Your sister in law is very entitled for her to demand that whatever you buy your daughter you buy your niece. This is YOUR money, you spend it however you want. You and your husband spent your lives building good careers for yourselves and are now living the life you built for yourselves. Your SIL had the same opportunity to do that for her kids and didn\u2019t, that\u2019s not your fault. You buy whatever you want for your family without apologies. You should never have to apologize for buying nice things for your kids! You are doing amazing job as parents!", "NTA - Good grief I had to read that twice to check your niece's age, that's behaviour you would expect from an extremely spoiled 8 year old, not 18.\n\nWhat you choose to buy your daughter is no one else's business but your own. Your in-law's behaviour was disgusting, you do not need to pander to your niece, though I would simply stop interacting with them, if they don't see your family they cannot be upset by what your daughter has.\n\nThe only - slight - criticism I would have is that your husband shouldn't have grabbed the bag, they sound deranged enough to accuse him of assault. Instead, you should have told her that if they didn't hand the bag back then you were going to report the bag as stolen to the police. And if they had still refused you should have followed through.", "It's unfortunate that the child and parents, obviously are having jealousy issues but you're NTA for your actions OP.", "NTA. This is ridiculous behavior from your SIL and your in-laws. You and your family are doing better financially and your daughter has a beautiful designer bag. So what? It doesn\u2019t give your niece any right to take it away from her, to lock herself in a bathroom because she \u201cwants it\u201d, and for your family to blame you for having better things. Your husband could have managed his anger, I have to say, because he stooped to the level of a 17 year old girl. He cannot go in and wrestle a bag like that. There are more mature ways to handle it. But you\u2019re not the asshole here.", "NTA.\n\nI kinda feel for the niece. She's probably very aware of the wealth disparity. I would not be shocked if the barb about all the money you guys have is one her mom has been repeating to her since she was young(er). So she made a really bad and probably impulsive decision, and it doesn't sound like she has great role models.\n\nThat said, it was still a really bad decision! I hope she can learn from this, even if her mom and gma seem determined to make it your fault. Which it isn't, by the way.\n\nEdit to remove a line, I thought niece was younger than she is.", "NTA. While I question the wisdom or logic in spending $2,000 on a purse for an 18 year old and if you had asked about that I might have called you the AH, you are not the AH for what happened at your MILs house and you owe no one an apology.  This assumes your daughter merely had her purse with her and she wasn\u2019t showing off, drawing attention to it or bragging about how much it costs.  If she was then she is the AH along with her cousin\n\nBut assuming she didn\u2019t do any of that, by the time you are 18 you should realize that there are people who have more than you and people who have less.  Life isn\u2019t fair that way.  And there is nothing you can do about it but appreciate what you have and be gracious about it. Your niece evidently hasn\u2019t figured this out b because she acted like she was an 8 year old throwing a temper tantrum.

I don\u2019t think her elevator goes all the way to the top if she thought she was going to get the bag by locking it and herself in the bathroom.", "Yeah, I like involving the police.", "Lol,  I gave have more credit and said 5 yr old.", "As the saying goes...\"the apple didn't fall far from the tree\"", "NTA. Your niece needs to learn about grand theft and all that. Especially since she\u2019s legally an adult. Next time, call the cops.", "NTA y\u2019all are better than me I would have called the cops on her", " Ma'am you are nicer than I am if somebody  stole  my bag even if it was my own cousin I wouldn't even try to get it back from her I'd be petty enough to call the police and say that she stole it because that's  Technically exactly what she did  And even after that and she didn't want to give it back I'd Sue her for the $2000 you paid for it", "The niece is 18\u2026 she should get a fkn grip on life and stop acting like a fkn brat. Your daughter worked hard for what she wanted and you just wanted to give her a gift. Your niece should apologize for the way she acted not the other way around. Fuck ppl are soo ridiculous. NTA", "NTA", "NTA. Would she do that to a complete stranger? Jesus", "don't bring your daughter there anymore please", "NTA It was this or calling the police. Theft of an item over $500 is a felony, I believe. You were **very** nice not to press charges.", "NTA what the fuck", "Is that a typo?!? She\u2019s 8,NOT 18,right? That behavior almost sounds like a mental \u2018break\u2019 to me. Never mind who\u2019s flaunting what,get that person an examination.", "INFO\n\nWhat on Earth?", "Maybe they should of had their daughter working part time as yours if she wanted designer items.  This is just rotten.  You sound like excellent parents and owe no apology.   Truthfully I started getting pissed myself reading this.  Clearly your daughter has a good head on her shoulders and deserved a nice graduation gift.  She obviously wasn't flaunting anything if it was hanging on a coat rack...\n\nEdit: Some parenting if they're enabling their bratty kid to think it's ok to steal from others.\n\nI hope Maria understands this wasn't any of her doing.  This is just sad you all had to deal with this.  Not only did she really want this bag and work so hard to deserve it but it has to have sentimental value since you and your husband surprised her with it for her graduation and all her achievements.", "NTA \n\nDont apologize. Maria can wear whatever she wants", "Nta. So\u2026 nieces solution to seeing something she likes is to simply steal it and her mom sees no issues with that?? Be prepared for the next phone call asking for bail money\u2026 I would be blocking them all so fast", "NTA. \n\nYour niece is a spoiled brat and your MIL and SIL are enablers.", "Nta they all owe your family an apology for the way they acted", "NTA. \n\nIf I were you I\u2019d double down. Deck Maria out from head to toe in YSL.", "Your SIL, MIL, and niece sound totally unhinged. NTA, though I wouldn't be taking my nice stuff or myself around them for a good, long while.", "NTA. I seriously had to read it twice, because I couldn't believe the niece being the same age as Maria. She's 18, snatches the bag, locks herself in the bathroom and refuses to give it back, because she \"wants it\"??? And SIL and MIL support this? Absurd. Niece, SIL and MIL sound exhausting.", "Should of called the cops in front of them all. Have the police deal with it and just stand back. It's ridiculous of them to expect you to provide for her what you do for your daughter. NTA", "NTA. They're down bad and jealous as fuck. Go NC without them.", "You are most definitely the asshole it is one thing for you to have the money to spoil your daughter. It is another thing to flaunt it in front of people, especially family members who can\u2019t afford it. I used to be the kid that had nothing and it should be your duty as an adult to make sure that no kid feels bad about themselves.", "I have to double check the age. Couldn't believe an 18-year-old would act like this.", "NTA.  Rationalizing and arguing with crazies is the definition of crazy, and there is not enough diazapan for dealing with that...  Take comfort in knowing you have raised a hard working young lady, who knows the value of a dollar.   And don't apologize for standing your ground.", "NTA\n\nThe other thing that could've been done is calling the police and having your niece charged with theft.  She can have a criminal record instead.\n\nBut what entitled brats your SIL and niece are.\n\nI'd be cutting them right off and having nothing to do with them.  You didn't even have to justify why you even bought the bag for your daughter.. the fact remains it was hers and her cousin just thought she'd take it because she wanted it.", "Your in-laws seem to think that taking the bag into the bathroom is the equivalent of a toddler hiding in the corner eating all the Halloween chocolate. *She's not supposed to do that but, Oh My Word, isn't she so cute? She already has her hands all over it. Let's just let her keep it this time.*\n\nMIL failed SIL. And now SIL is failing her daughter. They had **3 generations** to learn something beyond greed and jealousy, but nope! Not only are they stealing, they are outright DEMANDING they be given gifts. All of them live in the land of magical thinking.\n\nOP you are NTA.\n\nMaria using her bag and leaving it by the front door with all the coats is normal behavior. Flaunting would be gushing about it nonstop, and speaking about it in a way that is designed to make people envious.\n\nEven if Maria did flaunt the bag, it doesn't give her cousin the right to just take and claim it.\n\nIt's sad that this incident may have dampened Maria's joy around the bag, but I guess it's also a lesson on how there's a time and place for certain things. It's just too bad that the wrong place happened to be with her entire cousin's family!", "OP think how much more pleasant your life would be if you went NC with these people. NTA.", "this sounds made up", "This is the main problem in American society today... childish, entitled mentality that are too afraid to work.", "Monsters raising monsters. It's a tale as old as time itself.", "People get crazy envious when some has something they don\u2019t, I saw the video of a girl do an unboxing of her new designer bag, and the comments were fucked up, like dear she buy a bag for herself it\u2019s not your money don\u2019t judge.", "OP should call up SIL & MIL and be all \"I'm sorry. Sorry I didn't call the cops, so your daughter would learn not to be a thief.\"", "I was wondering if it was some sort of mental impairment right up until the SIL and MIL started blaming them...", "There really is no age where this sort of behaviour is acceptable though. But it\u2019s all down to parenting or lack of. I remember my 4yo being really confused why there was a kid at the supermarket having a full blown tantrum in the candy aisle. And i said well probably because he wants some sweets. And still confused she asked \u201cbut why is he doing that?\u201d Because from a young age she learnt crying and screaming for things gets you nothing. So why on earth would he think that sort of behaviour will produce the goods? - because *some* parents will produce the goods, that\u2019s why.", "A fkn 18 year old monster.", " Your neice took another person's property without permission."]}
