The problem with your brother's theory that it's ok because they never called her that is that, the more comfortable he and your father are in using that word in reference to your daughter, the more likely they are to slip up and say it in front of her. Unless you draw the hard line now, they will keep using that word until it's so natural for them that they won't realize your daughter is standing there one day, and hears them call her that.", "NTA of course! but I notice you say \"My family have been huge part of all her progress she had made, especially my father who babysat for me for free for the first year and half of my daughters life.\" This counts for something. Hold your boundary, that word is unacceptable though it was freely used not that long ago. But as your brother and father were laughing, they did know that they were crossing a line saying that. Do you think that they love your daughter? It's very mixed messages from them. No-one in my family would insult another family member like that, especially a child.", "I totally agree with you! You have a very special daughter! Your father and brother apparently don't understand how hurtful their words are, especially if your daughter should happen to hear them say it one day! You are definitely NTA!!!", "Absolutely NTA. Go Mama! Your daughter needs an advocate.", "NTA.\n\nYou need to talk to your husband about this.  He deserves to know not only because it affects his daughter, but it is also affecting you, and will affect his relationship with your brother and father.\n\nYour brother and father owe you an apology and assurance that they will not speak like that again.  I would not allow them near my child until I felt confident that they will not spew ableist insults anymore.", "NTA. \n\nMy brother was formally diagnosed autistic when we were young, I did not receive any diagnosis. I was a walking target at times. \n\nI had a crying panic attack earlier today cause I still am hurt by a boy in my 4th grade homeroom class saying quite loudly that I'm \"diseased like my brother.\" I didn't let it bother me cause I didn't think I was autistic; but I am. Even though it was 25ish years ago, the realization still hurts like I was still in 4th grade.", "Being neurodivergent does not mean your daughter is a R. You are not the asshole for defending your child. We have four adhd kiddos and one has autism. We have found neuro therapy a great help.", "I would forgive your father if he apologizes because his actions of free babysitting has shown you he loves her.  You need to tell them how hurt you are because the word is considered offensive and a slur.  It clearly offended your sister.   Gallows humor is a thing and I suspect they did not joke to hurt your daughter.   Tell your brother that doubling down and saying he was not in the wrong shows you that he has no problem making slurs against your daughter and shows you think less of her.\n\nGood luck.  I suspect grandpa will be hurt if he can't see her again.", "NTA. I might consider rescinding the ban if they offer a genuine apology and commitment to change, but absent that, I'd cut them off.", "I\u2019m so sorry your family seems ignorant and cruel. You did the right thing for the sake of your child. Kids pick-up on a lot and she\u2019ll eventually notice how they feel about her. This is gut-wrenching and I\u2019m so sorry that you have to go through such heartache. \ud83e\udd79", "NTA. Never feel bad about protecting your children. \n\nMy eldest daughter was assigned male at birth (and she's also autistic but it's not relevant here) and my dad seemed to have some trouble \"adjusting\" to her new name and basically wouldn't take the whole thing seriously. I sent him a long message one day that if he ever misgenders my child again and doesn't use her chosen name, I will not hesitate to cut him out of our lives. I haven't talked to my mother in ten years so he should know I'm not kidding around, especially when it comes to the wellbeing of my children. Fortunately he took it seriously, but if he hadn't, I would NOT have hesitated following through. \n\nYou're doing the right thing.", "Why do people think it\u2019s at all acceptable to refer to people that way. Ffs. Seriously ?!!?? Why would you think it\u2019s okay to refer to your niece that way? You wouldn\u2019t randomly or even \u201cjokingly\u201d insult/degrade a niece/nephew/child even if they didn\u2019t have a LD.", "I agree, tell the husband.  I'd be furious, but even more angry if it was kept from me, were it my child.  NTA.", "Absolutely. If she tells him she can control the time and place so it won\u2019t also be at the worst possible time. If you don\u2019t tell him, he\u2019ll absolutely find out at some point, but you don\u2019t know what else he\u2019ll be dealing with or if your dad or brother will be in the room and he\u2019ll also feel betrayed by you keeping him in the dark about something important involving his daughter. He has a right to know and to have an opinion on your brother and dad\u2019s role in her life. It\u2019s best to tell him immediately at home, preferably when your daughter\u2019s down for a nap or something.", "Thirded for tell your husband. He\u2019ll be more pissed that you didn\u2019t tell him, and you have handled the situation effectively already imho. NTA.", "I agree. But the commenters saying to go NC immediately might be too trigger-happy. People don\u2019t know until they are educated that some shit just doesn\u2019t fly anymore. Stand by that text 100%, but use this as a teaching moment as to why the word is so bad. The father and brother sound like they are truly invested in helping OP and her child which implies they love them both. Educate, lead with love, but keep that firm boundary in place - that\u2019s what I\u2019d do.", "I was diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia.", "Your father and brother in the wrong.", "People like you give me hope for my daughter, she's 4 and I want her to be happy and love a full life, better than I did. We're both autistic but I had to learn early to always hide it and I don't want her to have to do that.", "Hi dear neurokin \ud83d\udc95 thank you for sharing some possibilities & for doing some trope bus \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffb\u2728 I love our beautiful brains and the sincerity with which we maneuver the world \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "The morality of lying is an interesting question. Lying is a tool, I don't think it's inherently good or bad but intent is important. In a perfect world there wouldn't be a need to lie, but we don't and will never live in a perfect world. Lying is a critical safety tool in situations you need to get out of. Is giving someone the wrong number who is giving you the creeps wrong? If lying is black and white then yes it is wrong to lie in this situation. However, the intent there was to protect yourself. If manipulation is the end of of the lie then that is (to me) morally wrong. Understanding when and how to use your available tools could literally save your life.", "The R word is not slang tho. It\u2019s a slur.", "That varies. However, they're easy to underestimate. I'm teaching about 30 autistic kids this year who are in a special program, where the goal is to ease them into mainstreaming. A lot of them are majorly intelligent. Some are smarter than we gave them credit for. Like one girl, who spent a lot of time staring at nothing and giggling. I pointed out she navigated our online classroom system on her own, and did better than most on her phonics test. She's still behind on reading, most of my students are. It's hard to generalize about autistic kids, even in a positive way.", "I have worked with several gifted scientists who were autistic.", "Dude, no one loses when someone who uses slurs is cut off from children. This wasn\u2019t a slip. They laughed about it.", "I grew up using retard\u2026 I am a part of that generation.\n\nNow explain to me in any context where it isn\u2019t an insult?\n\nThe word itself is insulting even when used as a \u201cjoke\u201d.", "Agreed.\n\nAs a father, I'd be extremely pissed at my wife if this were a thing happening to our daughter and I was left out of the loop. I'd be pissed at the people using the term against my child and the person hiding that truth from me.", "YES, this.  Going NC immediately is cutting off your nose to spite your face.  These are folks who have supported and helped you and your daughter.\n\nThis isn't a popular opinion among kids today, but what you DO is often more important than what you SAY.  Your brother and father may think that calling your daughter the r-word doesn't hurt her, because she can't understand it.  They may even be *right*.  They need to know that it hurts *you,*  and it's not a word you speak about someone you love.  Depending on how your family works, they may even intend it in a loving way.  I know, sounds ridiculous, but a certain type of heart-of-gold-but-exterior-of-jerk can be crude.  You wouldn't believe the \"affectionate\" nicknames my dad, an electrician, bestowed on his helpers while he trained them.  They love him, even 30+ years later.  They'd die for him, seriously, but people who just heard the way he talked to him and not the way he *listened to them* and helped them out when they were in need?  They'd cancel him immediately and say nobody should ever work for him again.\n\nSo yeah, what they said is abhorrent and you're right to call them out.  But what they DO is show up for you and the kid, love you and the kid, *babysit* the kid and help you out...  Don't throw that away to be their language police.  You'll kick yourself later, and you'll deserve it.", "I only found out that I'm autistic recently, and I'm age 45. It's been a difficult life. There have been a few times in life when I've been basically non verbal (or minimally verbal lol!). I remember how hurting it was for my mother to always say, \"Talk to people. You have to TALK to people.\" I always felt not good enough. Now I am learning to accept myself, and it's all OK. \ud83d\ude42", "\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17\ud83e\udd17", "I understand and agree. That's when I have resorted to lying, like once when my mom wanted me to go somewhere that I didn't want to go. But if I do something wrong, and someone calls me on it, I can't lie. It's not in me.

They clearly didn\u2019t understand the impact of their words. Not everyone is smart. Not everyone has a high EQ. So you ban and cancel everyone from your life who makes one mistake?! Damn.

I experienced a lot of verbal abuse in my youth and now that I finally have the answers I feel so vindicated! \nI have never once worried about my son\u2019s future because of his neurodivergence because instead I choose to teach him to embrace his differences and use them to his benefit. His dad is a wonderful role model for this, he is an excellent and talented lawyer who takes on the specialized cases that the regular lawyers can\u2019t handle. He not only has his Juris Doctor but a Master\u2019s Degree in Business, despite having multiple learning disabilities including dyslexia, ADHD and most likely ASD. \nI\u2019m not as accomplished, I have physical disabilities as well that have been barriers in my life.

One, a game my cousins and I played was to try and get my uncle's hat. My sister was the one who got it. She looked concerned and pointed at his shirt, then stole his hat.
