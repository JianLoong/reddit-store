Two very large dildos and a fleshlight were missing. 30 minutes later the LitterRobot arrived, I immediately noticed the box had been opened and repacked. I was super annoyed because the sensors are so delicate and easy to damage. Once I cleared all of the random items off the top of the LitterRobot I realized the bonnet was missing and the globe was turned upside down. The bonnet was removed, bent in half, and stuffed inside the globe. When I removed the bonnet I was suddenly face to face with an 8inch hot pink dildo that was stuffed inside the globe of a CAT LITTER BOX.

Especially egregious because it is a cat litter box!\n\nThe relocation specialist responded with apologies about the damages and missing items, but avoided our privacy concerns.\n\nWe responded to a couple emails and I send photos to document the damaged items, including the LitterRobot and hidden dildos.

I can't imagine having the nerve to expect someone else to have to handle that stuff. Like, it's mind-blowing. I don't care about the benefits of a comprehensive relocation, you shouldn't have to be told that it is impolite and inappropriate to expect laborers to handle your own fucking sex toys.", "ESH\n\nYTA for pushing about the dildos. They were in a drawer, that was going to be packed. What you do here is put them in a box and move them yourself.  \n\n\nNTA - They opened pre-packed boxes, which was not part of the agreement and the customer service wasn't good.", "Nta and ewwwwwwwww! Gross!!!!\n\nNot Gross that you own or use dildos. That's your business. Gross that the company does not allow you to discern which items you may not want others manhandling. That policy is just wrong. Even aside from the private nature of the items being dildos what if it was a precious keepsake. Or valuable heirloom jewelery that you are territorial over. You should be allowed to exempt items from being handled by strangers who may not take the care you want. Plus If they were so blatantly disrespectful of your intimate items who else knows what they may have done to or with them.  I certainly wouldn't want to use any of them ever again. The company owes you a more specific apology, acknowlegemt of terrible policy and monetary damages to replace all the mishandled items.", "YWBTA. Your husband just took a promotion. Do you think it's wise to keep pressing for a \"dildo acknowledgment\" at this point?\n\nThe relocation specialist is a liaison between you and the third-party moving company. The company is the one that damaged your stuff and violated your privacy. The relo person might think they are sparing you further embarrassment by not yapping too much about the sex toys.\n\nIf the relo person has appropriately arranged for your damage claim to be paid, then they're done. You want to pursue the moving company for your pain and suffering, go ahead.", "Nope NTA. If this is their policy and how they're going to handle things they need to be made accountable and acknowledge what they did.", "INFO: What are you expecting the relocation specialist to do about the privacy violation?", "NAH. You're not going to get an apology, so you should back off a little. Also, I hope you don't live in Texas.\n\"Texas bans the possession of or promoting the use of more than six dildos.\"", "NTA. That's super messed up for them to do and they should have policies preventing them from repacking boxes or going through items already stowed.", "NTA. I'd be demanding reprimands, suspensions, or firings for the people involved in damaging property you explicitly informed them of the need for care of, and for the blatant disrespect shown by not only the juvenile douchebags that moved things for you, but for the refusal of the Relocation Specialist to act like a fucking ADULT, and acknowledge that your property was mishandled and damaged.", "NTA but I'm wondering if the reason they're not acknowledging is to make it just a little bit more difficult to sue them.", "Yeah, I was thinking would it void the entire contract if they mail themselves their dildo collection or something so it's not there for the company to fondle or mess up?", "This", "We don't care that the movers handled our dildos. We care that selective dildos were removed from the dresser and then put inside the litter box. They packed the dresser by covering it in plastic wrap, the contents were not removed from the drawers except these three sex toys. Unfortunately we were not allowed to pack our own boxes, it was part of the contract we signed for the move. Original factory boxes only.", "They did lose a precious heirloom and damaged a piece of sports memorabilia worth over $500.", "The relocation specialist is required to be included in all communications. The 3rd party moving company will not acknowledge the privacy violations either. It took them over a week to send the damages claims form after repeated requests.\n\nMy husband, as the employee, also wants the 3rd party movers and the relocations specialist to acknowledge that the movers went through our sex toys and put the dildos inside the litter box. He will not experience any professional consequences for demanding the privacy violations are addressed.", "They're talking about wanting the invasion of privacy acknowledged. That's perfectly acceptable. Would you hold this same position if they caught the movers sniffing their underwear on camera and wanted that acknowledged?", "No she wouldn\u2019t in anyway be the asshole for rightly requesting recompense.\n\nAsking if this is a hill to die on at this time is the correct question for this situation.", "Ahh yes, Texas\u2026where dildos are considered to be more dangerous than guns.", "How would they even know?", "Imagine thinking that if you didn't let some random people handle your sex toys the company would refuse to do the job or have literally anything at all to say about it. I would bet my entire life on the fact that everyone involved would greatly prefer and fully expect that a client secure their own dildos through a move.", "I mean you literally put the dildos (which are pricey AND awkward for the movers) in your suitcase or whatever and bring them separately. There's no way they would know about that.   \n\n\nIf there are items of value that you have specific instructions for, then you need to take extra precautions.", "I'm sorry to hear that. And it validates my negative opinion about the moving company policies.", "<<He will not experience any professional consequences for demanding the privacy violations are addressed.>>\n\nSuit yourself then. You've naive to think there will be no consequences though.", "He is in an industry where the invasion of privacy/security is considered more egregious than a large sex toy collection. His privacy complain will be validated if it escalated to his team level. He's also 100% behind every communication sent as we've discussed, drafted, and proofread them together."]}
