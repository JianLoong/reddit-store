I'm James Lawrence. Two of my cousins, my dad and three of his cousins, my grandfather, my great grandfather and his cousin, my great great grandfather and my great great great grandfather all had the same name. One of my cousins is expecting his first son and has already announced he will be continuing the tradition. So in another month we will have 9 living members of the family named James Lawrence. \n\nMy wife and I are expecting a son. We already decided we would not be continuing the tradition. I never wanted to continue it. Having the same name as so many living family members has been the biggest pain in my ass AND I am the same age as one of my cousins and we grew up 5 minutes from each other and went to the same schools. When I tell you it brought so many complications into my life, I am not exaggerating. \n\nMy parents were so excited when they heard we were having a boy and I told them immediately that we were not naming him James Lawrence. I told them the tradition as far as my side of the family is concerned has ended and I will not encourage it to be continued by my children in the future, but of course it is up to them ultimately. My parents did not like it and started asking what we did plan to name our son. We told them they would find out in time and he would be born before we announce his name.\n\nEver since they have attempted to tell my wife and I how hurt they are about our decision, and how they think it's a bad one. When they realized how little I cared they focused more on my pregnant wife and attempted with their thoughts on it to guilt her. So I put my foot down recently and told them some traditions need to end and they do not need to tell us what they think of that because we do not care and we will not change our minds based on what they think or want.\n\nMy parents told me I was being callously dismissive seeing as they themselves love the tradition and always believed I would love it one day too. I told them they believed that because they never listened to me. But they need to accept it. My parents stormed off and told me I need to grow up and realize I have a childish hatred for the tradition.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681554472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mxt6w/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_some_traditions/", "score": 8404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
