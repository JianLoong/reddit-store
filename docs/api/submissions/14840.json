I'm James Lawrence. Two of my cousins, my dad and three of his cousins, my grandfather, my great grandfather and his cousin, my great great grandfather and my great great great grandfather all had the same name. One of my cousins is expecting his first son and has already announced he will be continuing the tradition. So in another month we will have 9 living members of the family named James Lawrence. \n\nMy wife and I are expecting a son. We already decided we would not be continuing the tradition. I never wanted to continue it. Having the same name as so many living family members has been the biggest pain in my ass AND I am the same age as one of my cousins and we grew up 5 minutes from each other and went to the same schools. When I tell you it brought so many complications into my life, I am not exaggerating. \n\nMy parents were so excited when they heard we were having a boy and I told them immediately that we were not naming him James Lawrence. I told them the tradition as far as my side of the family is concerned has ended and I will not encourage it to be continued by my children in the future, but of course it is up to them ultimately. My parents did not like it and started asking what we did plan to name our son. We told them they would find out in time and he would be born before we announce his name.\n\nEver since they have attempted to tell my wife and I how hurt they are about our decision, and how they think it's a bad one. When they realized how little I cared they focused more on my pregnant wife and attempted with their thoughts on it to guilt her. So I put my foot down recently and told them some traditions need to end and they do not need to tell us what they think of that because we do not care and we will not change our minds based on what they think or want.\n\nMy parents told me I was being callously dismissive seeing as they themselves love the tradition and always believed I would love it one day too. I told them they believed that because they never listened to me. But they need to accept it. My parents stormed off and told me I need to grow up and realize I have a childish hatred for the tradition.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681554472, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12mxt6w/aita_for_telling_my_parents_that_some_traditions/", "score": 220, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I do not share that feeling lol. It's a pain in the ass to live with.", "I hate the tradition personally so I don't really want to compromise on it. Neither name is one my wife or I like anyway so it would be doing it for the sake of keeping the peace, which I don't feel is totally fair. I have siblings though so maybe they will continue it.", "I gave my son 2 middle names so that there is a wide range of choice if he decided he didn't like Will or William. It's his choice, his name, his options. I like your parenting style!", "I don't even like the idea of naming juniors. It puts pressure on that child, it can come off as favoritism to other children, and what if you have a terrible name.", "NTA\n\nSeems to me that the tradition is continuing, just not in your branch of the family. The extended family is carrying on. Maybe cold comfort to your parents, but that is life.", "If one of your cousins ends up as a ne'er do well, it could cause big problems for the other JLs, too.", "Congratulations on the baby! Parenting comes with many many decisions and it's good you're setting boundaries with your parents early. My Mom in particular had many complaints about some seemingly benign choices we made (how we swaddled, choosing gender neutral clothing...) and we've had to put our feet down more than I expected.", "Wow. How in the heck do conversations even work? Like how do they know who is being talked about?", "I would honestly have your wife block your parents and then you tell them that since they can\u2019t be trusted not to harass your pregnant wife that all communication is to go through you", "I had to untangle a mess of Irish ancestors where the grandfather, uncle, and son all had the exact same name. One stayed in Ireland, two moved to the US, one of which returned to Ireland after the American Revolution.\n\nMultiple researchers mixed up the records, dates, and locations, and all in all made it a nightmare to tease apart.", "It\u2019s funny. As I was reading this I was thinking that they probably think it is special and unique that they have this tradition, when it\u2019s really the exact opposite.", "These kind of traditions are the worst, stand your ground on this one. When a tradition becomes an obligation that people are uncomfortable with, it's time to end it. NTA.", "Not OP but just wanted to drop by and say how incredibly heart warming this comment thread is.\n\nGlad to see such accepting and open-minded parents :)", "We did the same thing. His middle name has a nickname, he has his actual name, or he can go by his first/middle initials. He has at least 4 choices.", "My brother has a similar set of names, the tradition in my family is to name the first born \"Hans\" but has no specific details as to what the second name is, so there he had a choice and one day he just said he didn't want to be called \"Hans\" anymore and we should please go by a nickname of the second name, and thats how he is called till today. And everyone is happy. But 9 times the exact same name without variation is just insane.", "I mean in my family we have Tom, Tommy, Thomas, Big Tom, Little Tom, grandpa Tom, Ned's Tom, Tom's Tom, Little Thomas, Big Thomas, and Tiny Tommy.\n\n11 people with some variant of Tom.", "I would imagine that the mum would be referenced like 'Brenda's boy' kinda thing. Or in the case of elders 'Brenda's husband'.", "LOL\n\nWe have the same, but in addition to the Tom\u2019s we also have Anthonys. Anthony, Big Anthony, Little Anthony, Tony, Big Tony and Baby Tony. \n\nBaby Tony turns 70 this year."]}
