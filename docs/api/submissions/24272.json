I have to be at work at 8:30 in the morning and sometimes, in the area I\u2019m in, whenever I request, it takes 10-15 minutes for the driver to get here. \n\nSo I order the Uber, and a relatively elderly man comes to pick me up(early to mid 60\u2019s I believe), and INSISTS that I get in the front seat. Even went so far as to have the back seat doors locked and only the front seat unlocked. I didn\u2019t want to argue as if I had ordered another Uber and cancelled the current one, it would have made me late. He was friendly enough and we had pleasant conversation, but the fact that I was in the front seat made me VERY uncomfortable. My husband is an Uber driver and he tells me stories all the time about how uncomfortable HE is when customers sit in the front when they\u2019re alone. Having multiple people in his car is another story, but that\u2019s besides the point. \n\nAnyhow, after the ride I figured I\u2019d never see the guy again so I made nothing of it and ignored it. \n\nA few days later, I get the same guy, AGAIN, and he again insists I sit in front. I still don\u2019t have time to argue with him about sitting in front, and I\u2019m a lot more quiet this time around and not really responding to his attempts to make conversation, though he keeps talking. He then mentioned wanting to sit down with my husband(as I had told him the first time around that he was also an Uber driver and I was just trying to make pleasant conversation) to talk about shared experiences driving for Uber. \n\nI thought this was very weird and was quiet the rest of the ride to my work. After it was over, I REALLY didn\u2019t want to get the driver again so I made a report to Uber and told them about how the backseat door was locked and how he INSISTED I get into the front seat, and requested to not get paired with the driver again. Support told me that his behavior was unacceptable, (I\u2019m assuming gave him a warning) and assured me that I wouldn\u2019t be paired with him again. \n\nI later told my husband and one of my friends about this. My husband was 100% on my side but my friend not so much. She explained that maybe the back doors on his car didn\u2019t work, but I know that\u2019s not the case as the Uber driver tried to tell me a story about a couple getting into his car where the wife was in the front seat and the husband was sitting in the back. She then called me an asshole for potentially ruining his source of income by reporting him. She also mentioned that I shouldn\u2019t let my introverted nature ruin someones professional reputation. \n\nNow I\u2019m second guessing myself. The driver was nice enough, and I could have just let it go, I don\u2019t know, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1691603558, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mmdbd/aita_for_reporting_my_uber_driver_when_he_asked/", "score": 204, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
