{"id": 24272, "submission_id": "15mmdbd", "title": "AITA for reporting my Uber driver when he asked me to sit in the front seat?", "selftext": "Pretty much the title, but here\u2019s some more context. \n\nI 27F had to sell my car and me and my husband have been exclusively using his car, or have been using Uber. I have to be at work at 8:30 in the morning and sometimes, in the area I\u2019m in, whenever I request, it takes 10-15 minutes for the driver to get here. \n\nSo I order the Uber, and a relatively elderly man comes to pick me up(early to mid 60\u2019s I believe), and INSISTS that I get in the front seat. Even went so far as to have the back seat doors locked and only the front seat unlocked. I didn\u2019t want to argue as if I had ordered another Uber and cancelled the current one, it would have made me late. He was friendly enough and we had pleasant conversation, but the fact that I was in the front seat made me VERY uncomfortable. My husband is an Uber driver and he tells me stories all the time about how uncomfortable HE is when customers sit in the front when they\u2019re alone. Having multiple people in his car is another story, but that\u2019s besides the point. \n\nAnyhow, after the ride I figured I\u2019d never see the guy again so I made nothing of it and ignored it. \n\nA few days later, I get the same guy, AGAIN, and he again insists I sit in front. I still don\u2019t have time to argue with him about sitting in front, and I\u2019m a lot more quiet this time around and not really responding to his attempts to make conversation, though he keeps talking. He then mentioned wanting to sit down with my husband(as I had told him the first time around that he was also an Uber driver and I was just trying to make pleasant conversation) to talk about shared experiences driving for Uber. \n\nI thought this was very weird and was quiet the rest of the ride to my work. After it was over, I REALLY didn\u2019t want to get the driver again so I made a report to Uber and told them about how the backseat door was locked and how he INSISTED I get into the front seat, and requested to not get paired with the driver again. Support told me that his behavior was unacceptable, (I\u2019m assuming gave him a warning) and assured me that I wouldn\u2019t be paired with him again. \n\nI later told my husband and one of my friends about this. My husband was 100% on my side but my friend not so much. She explained that maybe the back doors on his car didn\u2019t work, but I know that\u2019s not the case as the Uber driver tried to tell me a story about a couple getting into his car where the wife was in the front seat and the husband was sitting in the back. She then called me an asshole for potentially ruining his source of income by reporting him. She also mentioned that I shouldn\u2019t let my introverted nature ruin someones professional reputation. \n\nNow I\u2019m second guessing myself. The driver was nice enough, and I could have just let it go, I don\u2019t know, am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1691603558, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mmdbd/aita_for_reporting_my_uber_driver_when_he_asked/", "score": 16, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Some friends love to manufacture conflict where none exists.", "NTA Here in my country when they  ask passengers to seat in the front seat is because they want to pass as a regular car rather than an Uber.", "NTA, anybody making people do things they are uncomfortable with, especially in the service business, should be reported. Additionally, good you listened to your gut and he sounds entitled to how he likes his things while not caring about the comfort of others. Could have been because he is an older man that could be lonely, could be something else. Whatever it was, he was adamant about pushing your boundaries.", "NTA. You have the right as a customer to report unsatisfactory experiences with their drivers. Uber is the same as any ride company (taxi, limo, bus). You sit in the back, period. I've had Uber drivers ask me if I prefer the back or the front seat and I appreciate that they give me a choice. But it is unacceptable for a driver to insist you sit next to him. That would make any woman uncomfortable. Now he's probably old school, bless his heart, but reporting him will certainly give him a lesson in professional driver protocol.", "NTA.  You were paying for this ride and you wanted to sit in the backseat.  That should have been respected.", "NTA\n\nOld dude is creeping on younger women, I assume, he finds fairly attractive \"for company\".  If he's lost his source of income from  your complaint, that's on the driver, not on you.", "NTA. If the back doors don't actually work, wouldn't that also violate his driver agreement, similar to if the AC is broken or something like that? I only briefly looked into driving for Uber a few years ago, so I really don't remember their rules well, please correct if I'm wrong.", "Lol you\u2019re a paying customer, you should be able to sit wherever you like. I also enjoy quiet rides and basically ignore overly chatty drivers who pry too much. It\u2019s creepy behaviour to demand someone sit next to him and have back doors locked. I\u2019d report him too.", "NTA, and your friend is 100% wrong. If ANYTHING on the driver's car wasn't working properly, he wouldn't - or at least shouldn't - be driving in the first place. You did exactly the right thing by asking not to be paired with him and explaining why. If Uber decides to no longer use him as a driver, that's a result of his own behavior, not anything you did. You're paying good money to use Uber - you should be able to feel comfortable during the ride.", "NTA\n\nBUT\n\nYou aren't a compassionate human being either.\n\nThere are a lot of different things happening in this story...your discomfort is very important. But you don't talk about it as a safety issue, just as you hired him as a driver only.\n\nPeople that age driving Uber are often lonely and looking for discussion. He needs to learn to read his customers and whether or not they are open to chatting...not force them to sit up front with him.\n\nSounds like the guy wasn't inappropriate, just not what you want in a driver. You're allowed to decide that and report him so you don't get paired again.\n\nBut, this story just kinda makes me sad.", "I would have simply asked him, \"Why do you want me to sit in the front and not the back which is normal?\"\n\nBut you did not and reported him.  I do not think you did anything wrong in reporting him, but you could have just asked first.\n\nAt 27, you should be a little more assertive (assertive being straightforward, not rude).", "Did he do anything inappropriate?\nDid he make unwanted passes?\nDid he put you in any danger?  \n\nIf the answer to any of these questions is \u201cyes\u201d your action is justified.

How do you know he would have argued? He might just have said, yes. \n\nIf he said anything inappropriate, you should report him. But from what you are saying, he just asked you to sit in front.
