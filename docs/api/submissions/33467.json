That's going to be very hurtful when/if they find out the truth, and why they were removed.\n\nI think you need to redo the album, if it hasn't already been given, and add back the beginning pages. Even if it means buying a different book. What you created was thoughtful, kind, very loving, and has nothing to do with putting anyone \"first\" or not.
