That is for your family. Why does it matter to her what order it is in? She never even has to see it.\n\nYou need to set some boundaries with your wife ASAP because now that you've let her get away with  this kind of behaviour once, there will be other times and you will be put in even more difficult situations where your wife will make you choose between her and your family.\n\nYour wife not liking your family is not an excuse for irrational behaviour.
