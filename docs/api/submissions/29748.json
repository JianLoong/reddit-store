A little bit of a background story; me, 21f, is overweighted and never has a boyfriend.\n\nI visited my family last weekend and my sister told me when I was away in uni, my brother (14) told her that I will never have a chance to get married, that im so fat that no one will ever like me.\n\nI was obviously sad but surprisingly not furious. I sat on the couch for few hours and didn\u2019t utter a single word. Later my brother asked me to help him with his homework. I looked at him and said it in a sarcastic tone \u2018why dont you ask someone that has a chance to get married for help. I dont think an unlikeable person could help you with anything\u2019 He then obviously knew what I was referred to. He ran to mum and said I didn\u2019t help me.\n\nMy mum came out of her room, barged into the living room and yelled at me \u2018I paid for your fucking college, I paid everything for you and thats how you repay me? You wouldn\u2019t even help your own brother? You are fucking selfish and you wont even help your family \u2019\n\nI yelled back at her and told her wt happened.\n\nShe then yelled back\u2019 And? Was he wrong? You cannot silence every-fucking-one in this world. You can threaten your brother but that doesnt change the fact that you are fat and ugly. And now you are selfish. No one will ever love you and marry you.\u2019\n\nI then just cried and left my house and went back to my dorm. Haven\u2019t contacted my parents ever since.\n\nMy mum texted me that shes very disappointed at me cause as the eldest sister, I should help my brother and she was already v stressed after work, she doesn\u2019t need these kind of bullshit around the house.\n\nEdit: Just wanted to add some INFO on why I might be the AH.\n\nI know Im much older than him and honestly I shld have acted in a more mature manner. Maybe I shouldn\u2019t have \u2018confronted\u2019 him or maybe I should have dealt with it in a more peaceful manner. Its just that im sensitive about my weight for obvious reason\ud83d\ude05\n\nHvnt had the courage to read the comments but I\u2019d like to just thank you for any input.

If you rely on your mom, I'd say just get by. Tell her whatever things she wants until you are independent financially. If you think you can improve your relationship with your brother, you should. He is parroting your mom, so don't get too mad at him. He was wrong to say those things, but he may not be unredeemable. Mom is a lost cause. Take her money if you can and give yourself the best foot forward you can. Also, men love women of all sizes and styles. Don't let them discourage you. College is a great way to meet a partner. Don't let it pass you by. Good luck.", "NTA\n\n**First,** why in the world did your sister think it was a good idea to tell you what your brother said?   It was mean that he said it, but even worse that your sister chose to be the town crier and tell you.\n\n**Second**, your refusal to help him was probably in part due to your hurt feelings about his mean comment.  Your mom should have listened to the entire story instead of berating you.  SHE was an AH.\n\n**Third,** don't let your family convince you that you are so unattractive that you will never find someone  to love or care about you.  Coming from the family unit you have described, your self esteem is probably pretty low.  Check with the counseling service at your school and see if they can help you work through your ingrained feelings of being worthless.\n\n**Fourth**, distance yourself from your family much as you can.  Get involved in a club that interests you - that's a good way to meet people, and help you feel good about yourself.\n\n**Fifth,** there is someone for everyone.  \"Physical beauty\" is important to some people (unfortunately, those people keep the of plastic surgeons in business).  There are other people who look at the person inside.\n\n**Sixth,** relax and enjoy school!  College is supposed to be about growing up, learning new things, meeting people and figuring out where you fit in the world.  The model of people getting married \"right after college\" has pretty much gone away.  Finish your education, get a job and figure out who YOU are as an individual.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA. I'm not surprised that your brother is turning out to be like that with your mom as a role model. Focus on becoming independent. Find support elsewhere if you need it. Good luck.", "NTA! There are so many things wrong with your family but you are not one of them.  First stay strong and you sre just 21 years old.  Basically, you have whole life head of you.", "NTA. Even if it is 100% true that you are hopelessly overweight, he\u2019s your own brother. He should never speak so terribly of you. If you can\u2019t count on loyalty and compassion from your own flesh and blood you are playing the game of life on hard mode. Hard truths should be shared among family and close friends in confidence and face to face. Your brother and your mother should both know better. \n\n\nYou\u2019re entitled to take some time away from your family but I would caution you against holding a permanent grudge. Doing so will only harm you in the long run.", "Sorry to say this but IMO your mother has no class and is not very bright.  You don't say the things she said to you to your daughter.  A mother should encourage self esteem not tear it down.  You deserve better.  NTA", "NTA \ud83d\udc97\ud83d\udc97\n\nhe\u2019s old enough to know better. & i hope you know you\u2019re worthy of love regardless of other peoples opinions about you\ud83d\udc95", "This post made me so sad. You deserve better. It sucks but might be time to cut contact with your family for a bit before they destroy you as a person. \nHow do you feel about it all??", "NTA. If your college has a mental health service available, I suggest you take advantage of it. Your household sounds toxic and you might benefit from counseling. \n\nSecond, you will never find someone who will love you if you can't love yourself. Don't settle for just anyone. Find someone worthy of you. You don't want to find yourself in an abusive relationship. \n\nFinally, you don't have to be married to have a wonderful life. You can have your own adventures and not have to answer to anyone. You can wake up and decide that you want to eat croissants in Paris and you can just grab your passport and go, providing you can afford it.", "NTA  Time to go NC and live your life!", "Oh honey, you are so, NTA! Your brother sounds like a carbon copy of your mom, and if you have weight issues, I have two guesses where they\u2019re coming from. Finish UNI, find people in your life that cherish you and love you for who you are inside, and start to love yourself. Forget about mom, forget about brother, you don\u2019t need toxic people in your life who are damaging your self-esteem, and damaging the true beauty that you are. Shine, baby shine!", "Time to stop visiting the family.", "Babe, let\u2019s talk. Let\u2019s start to put the notion that only beautiful people deserve love, happiness and meaningful relationships to rest, that\u2019s not how it works. Being beautiful helps with finding people, to attract them, but love and relationships don\u2019t last on that premises alone. Being a good person, have a good personality, education are factors in that. Now about being ugly and fat, try to start to change the way you perceive yourself, how? Distancing yourself from people who thinks that it\u2019s ok to call others fat an ugly, or that thinks that they are justify in doing so, or even worse that by doing so they\u2019re doing you a favor. No amount of stress, of guilt tripping, of \u201cbut I\u2019m you mother\u201d will make a wrong thing turn to a right one. Wrong is still wrong. Last thing baby girl, when you\u2019ll get free from all that negativity shit, work on yourself, became the best version of you that you can, for yourself, cause you deserve it and you\u2019re worth it.", "Oh man that's harsh and messy.\n\nI would say your brother isn't really the AH. He's still young and dumb. I probably would have accepted a half assed apology any given him a hand.\n\nYour mum on the other hand is the AH, and clearly where your brother gets it from", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
