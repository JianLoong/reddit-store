Who ever shows up shows up.  \n\nOnly party I ever expected an RSVP to was my wedding.", "But she didn\u2019t ask her to put the dogs away, she asked IF they were going to be put away. And then she stayed away, just as you advised.", "Normal to me.  Its common courtesy to lock up pets when guests are at your house.  All my friends and family its the norm.", "So?  Is that bad?", "At what point in the story did op demand the dogs be loved up?  \n\nWhen did op stipulate that op requires the dogs be locked up in order for op to attend?\n\nOp asked.  Once.  Than like an adult, op took host's answer as final, without argument.  At what point is this selfish?", "When did op demand they be locked up? I missed that part.", ">I'm sorry but you're selfish as shit. It's her house, not yours. \n\nWhich is why I stayed home...", "[deleted]", "Yes, you should RSVP. If only to make sure there is enough food and drinks.", "See for my friend group it's different. If we make plans in the group chat then everyone says if they can come or not and if someone isn't online we message them privately to ask.", "And had that been the end of it, that would be fine. But she just had to be an AH about it by not responding when she asked about the dog and the host told her the dogs wouldn't be \"locked up\". It was rude to not respond with a text like \"I'm sorry, I won't be able to attend.\" Instead she ghosted her friend without explanation.\n\nAnd, yes, the implication from her first comment about the dogs was that she expected the dogs to be locked up. It's like asking a parent if they're going to lock up their kids, *in their own home.*", "Literally same difference.", "Different cultures I guess. For me, it's the dog's house too, the guests are guests. If op didn't want to be around the dog they could have communicated like a grown up when they were invited.", "For me, I won't be locking my dogs up for anyone, as it's their house too. I even joke that it's their house, I'm just here to pay the bills. But it's also any potential guest's right to decline an invitation if they don't like that, wouldn't hurt my feelings either way. They just don't get to get angry because I refuse to lock them up (which I've never had a problem with, and it looks like OP didn't get angry either)", "OP told her friend the reason she didn\u2019t come over was bc her friend didn\u2019t lock up the dogs. She specifically states she asked if the friend was going to lock up the dogs, didn\u2019t go to the party, and then she told her friend why she didn\u2019t go to the party. Are you suggesting there is some other reason OP didn\u2019t go to the party other than her explicitly stated reason? Passively aggressive ignoring the friend during the party and then playing the victim afterward is not being an adult. It\u2019s being selfish.", "It\u2019s not that OP demanded, it\u2019s that OP is judgmental and pouty about it. That\u2019s self-centered and entitled.", "You also never let her know you weren't coming. You asked if she was locking up the dogs, she said no and when the party came it took five texts from her for you to say you weren't coming. Idk, I just can't imagine disliking dogs so much that you can't be around them for a little bit to be with your friends. And I'm not even a huge dog person, I like them but have no real desire to have one of my own. \n\nBut really it's the lack of communication from your end. Your friend getting the no from you was like pulling teeth.", "Cool, you can read and go through post history.", ">. It's like asking a parent if they're going to lock up their kids,   \n>  \n>in their own home.\n\nno its not.  what an absurd comment.", ">OP told her friend the reason she didn\u2019t come over was bc her friend didn\u2019t lock up the dogs.\n\nAfter the host kept bugging OP.", "But its the host that kept pushing OP.  If anything the host is being judgemental and pouty.", "It's only absurd of you aren't a pet person. Not everyone is, but just because you don't value something the way someone else does, doesn't mean that they are absurd for believing their pet is family.", "Just to be clear, she never told the host she wasn\u2019t coming. She just ignored the host after the host said she wouldn\u2019t lock up the dogs. Then when the host inquired whether she was coming over, it took five texts before OP said she wouldn\u2019t make it. Here\u2019s an idea: if OP had just told the host she couldn\u2019t make it up front, then the host would have never sent the texts asking whether she was coming (\u201cbugging her\u201d according to you). It\u2019s pretty simple to let someone know whether you\u2019re coming or not before an event.", "This is why my children are required to eat out of a metal bowl on the floor because pets are family and my dog children would get jealous if they saw my human children getting special privileges.", "People can think pets are family, but its absurd to equate it to a human child.  My sister considers her dogs family, but her dogs are not family to me.", "Well, then the only thing I have left to say is that psychologists have studied and found that the loss of a pet is as painful as the death of a close relative. I just had my 17yo dog put to sleep. He slept by my side for 16 years, which is longer than most marriages. I miss him like I miss my mom.", "I wouldn't bother with this person any further. According to their post history, they're a dog hater. So, you're never changing their opinion.", "> have studied and found that the loss of a pet is as painful as the death of a close relative.\n\nSure for that person.  When my sisters dogs die i'm sure my sister will be distraught.  Its not something i'm going to grieve.  Our grandmother passes away, that affects a large portion of the family.", "Oh man that is so hard :( even when you know they had the best life, it doesn\u2019t make you miss them any less. I always feel the worst when I catch myself holding the door for them and then they aren\u2019t there"]}
