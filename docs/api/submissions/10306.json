People have come here to socialize and a few don\u2019t want to interact with a dog.  I really feel since I\u2019m the host I should make their visit nice.  I really don\u2019t see the problem.  I have been a guest to other dog owner\u2019s homes and they ask or have the dog/dogs already in some room.  I always tell them that i absolutely want the dog with me.  I do warn them that I am going to talk to the more than I am going to talk to them!   Lol They always laugh and get the dogs, after that the pets are always there to greet me.  Whether a cat or a dog, I bring treats and the animals know I not cheap with treats\u2026. Anyway, people who refuse to put their pets away are rude, everyone needs to respect each other.  Discussions are the only way to accomplish this and come to an agreement from there.", "You wanted your friend to choose you over her dogs, and she didn't.  You are insecure and should probably get therapy.", "I thought dogs make parties better", "YTA for not responding and letting her know you wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole for not wanting to be by her dogs, if they are the type to jump on people at all.. but you\u2019re an adult and could of communicated this in a better way than simply ignoring her and never responding until last minute.", "NAH nope, if you don't like her dogs, it's perfectly fine for you to skip her parties. She's also not TA for refusing to lock her dogs up. They live there. As long as they don't hurt anyone and are friendly, she has every right to choose to keep her dogs out in her own house at her own party. So NAH", "Nta...she knew you had dog issues...she knew very well you not attending was dog related...no need to respond back once she said dogs weren't put up. She knew .she knew.", "ESH. You should have said you couldn't make it because of the dog roaming around. She shouldn't have spammed your phone. You all are both annoying in this situation - just stop being friends.", "YTA \nAt your age? You\u2019re turning 30 and you still can\u2019t communicate properly? SMH", "Sounds like you are just trying to control the situation. Is it possible that you are irritated with this friend about something else and you're looking for reasons to avoid her.\n\nI mean, your friends clearly liked you and want to spend time with you.  Why are you so insulted by that?", "YTA- ONLY because you didn\u2019t just tell her from the get go you couldn\u2019t mKe it. If you are someone who just doesn\u2019t enjoy dogs or being around a couple of them in closed quarters then that is fine. You do you. You didn\u2019t kick up a big fuss. You just didn\u2019t want to go and was fine with it. She needs to have the same attitude towards you and just be fine with it. Instead she chose to be insulted. Not everyone likes dogs. (Not me, I LOVE my fur babies)", "NTA. You did nothing wrong.", "NTA\n\nYour friend needs to take a hint and leave you be. You asked if the dogs would be roaming free, so while you might not have said anything explicitly about not wanting to be around the dogs, it should be clear after no response to 2 \"come over\" texts that you didn't want to be there. \n\nThat behavior is akin to dog that doesn't understand you don't want to play but keeps shoving a slimy dog toy on you.", "So... just to make sure I'm understanding here. \n\nAre you allergic to dogs? Do you have some kind of dog related trauma that makes you afraid of them? Or are you really letting yourself lose a friendship because your friend has pets", "ESH. Your friend is deciding for you how you should feel, but it would've been better to communicate more clearer that you weren't going. Not in the wrong for not going though.", "ESH - You don\u2019t like dogs and it is what it is. No one can force you. However you are the asshole for not letting her know you wouldn\u2019t be coming ahead of time. Your friend shouldn\u2019t have had to text you five 5 times to get a response. Whenever I host a party and someone doesn\u2019t reply with a simple yes or no they are coming, it drives me bonkers. The person hosting the party just wants to know so they know how much food and drinks to get. The whole a response is a response thing is dumb, because you are essentially leaving your friend on read. Not responding doesn\u2019t still doesn\u2019t let the host know if you are coming or not, we can\u2019t read minds. That said she should respect that you simply don\u2019t like dogs, and shouldn\u2019t have given you crap for that. Your friend needs to realize that there will have to be some sort of compromise if you wish to remain friends.", "YTA", "NTA, dog owners tend to think it's okay to leave their dogs everywhere, I'm the same as you, and I wouldn't have come either. if you ask all the time, your friend KNOWS VERY WELL why you didn't come, she just wanted to do dramas.", "As soon as she said she wasn\u2019t going to lock the dogs up, you decided not to go. Totally understandable. Why didn\u2019t you just decline the invite then and there?", "YTA for being petty and passive aggressive in not just communicating to her, like an adult, that you weren\u2019t going to her party. You\u2019re also the AH for expecting her / wanting her to lock her own dog up in it\u2019s own home, especially since the dog doesn\u2019t seem to have any behavioral issues besides having the nerve to exist when you\u2019re around. I hate to tell you this but if her dog being around is the hill you\u2019re willing to die on you might just be the one whose \u201ckicked\u201d from the friend group.", "OP asked her about the dogs and decided not to go based on the answer.  She has as much right to do that as her friend has to not lock her dogs up.  She is NTA for that part but a bit of one for not letting her friend know she wasn\u2019t coming.", "EXACTLY THIS. Thank you.", "Yeah this get together seemed informal and didn't require an RSVP. If you don't like the dogs then don't go and that's what you did. NTA", "I think most of the YTA was in not RSVPing to the invitation.  The host doesn\u2019t have to lock up their dogs, OP doesn\u2019t have to attend, but OP could have politely declined the invite.", "Any invitation should be RSVP\u2019d.  just rude not to.", "Same", "If I invite my friends and they can't even do me the courtesy of declining, no reason needed, I probably wouldn't invite them again. It's not hard to say \"hey I'm not coming, have fun\" or shit like that.", "My church has a group text\u2026.. it is muted af. They used to drive me insane", "This", "I feel like she could have let the friend know \"ok, I'm not comfortable coming if the dogs will be out\". Then the friend could make a decision whether or not to put the dogs away to have the friend attend.", "She didn\u2019t share that decision with the host. That\u2019s why OP is TA.", "I have trouble when it\u2019s a group text with just myself and my 2 daughters.  Lol. They type FAST!   Lol", "That's fair. OP definitely could have communicated better.", "My parents didn\u2019t lock us up, but they would send us downstairs (walkout basement) when they had friends over to play cards or for a party.", "Because dog people on Reddit are unhinged.", "For me it\u2019s the in-laws and then they include their in-laws and then everybody makes comments to each others comments. I\u2019ve gotten to the point that I just wait til everyone\u2019s done and then comment last.", "i dislike dog (prepared for the downvotes) and i always asks anyone i'm going by if they have dogs and where they will be before i consider going. Nothing is wrong witht that the only reason OP is an asshole is because she should've told her friend she wasn't coming to the party.", "XD people will pull the drunk person off you though. With dogs, it's just \"oh, isn't he sweet, he likes you!!\""]}
