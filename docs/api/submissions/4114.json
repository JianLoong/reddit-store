So backstory: I have a 2yo toddler and 9mo baby. My SIL had a baby 4 months ago. I worked through both of my pregnancies and worked while my toddler was a baby until I was 4 months pregnant with baby #2. I now stay home with both my kids while I go to school full time. My SIL went back to work when her baby turned 3mo. Today I finished my first semester of school and was so excited to have a month break of before spring semester started. She told me I am always off because I stay home. Whatever ya know, opinions are like assholes everyone has them. But this isn\u2019t the first time she has said something like this. It is constantly that I don\u2019t have it hard because I stay home. I usually got over the comments because the added stress of an argument wasn\u2019t worth it. Today was the exception. I finally stood up for myself and I told her I understand we both have different lifestyles so they don\u2019t need compared, not all women can handle being a SAHM so it is what it is, please stop undermining my daily life and responsibilities. And she thinks that I have told her she directly can\u2019t handle being a SAHM and is taking it so personal. I get that working moms have mom guilt, I was there before. But I would never tell someone they are a bad mom or less than a good mom because they don\u2019t stay home.

Saying that SAHP life isn't for all parents is a statement of fact, just information.  Not a judgment.  No parent has an easy life. Being a full time student is not a life of leisure either.  It isn't a contest.  When she starts down this path, I would not reply to her any more.  She is being an AH with her remarks.  I would try the Grey Rock Technique.  She sounds like she thrives on drama.  The Grey Rock Technique can defuse that.", "ESH. She was being judgmental and out of line saying that you're \"always off\" because yes, being a SAHM is a lot of work and responsibility, and she was undermining that. But then you stooped to her level. You know you're being facetious with your whole \"oh she *thinks* I mean *she personally* can't handle it when that's not the precise wording I used\", you know damn well that's what you meant. Saying \"not everyone can handle\" it directly implies that anyone who isn't a SAHM isn't *good enough to be one*, and thus choosing to be a working mom is a failure (due to being \"unable to handle\" being a SAHM) rather than a perfectly valid personal life choice. You say \"I would never tell someone they are a bad mom or less than a good mom because they don\u2019t stay home\" but that's absolutely what your words implied, and what you obviously meant them to imply.\n\nSince this seems to be the first time you \"stood up for yourself\" and you claim to believe your lifestyles don't need to be compared, why not actually tell her that? Communicate about how hurtful those comments are, ask her to stop, have a discussion? Like, she implied that your life as a SAHM is easier than her life as a working mom and you implied that her life as a working mom is easier than your life as a SAHM. What does that accomplish?", "ESH. It sounds like you were both being judgmental towards each other. Based on how you said it, I would have taken it personally too, even if you didn\u2019t mean it that way.

My cousin has a rewarding job that she loves and absolutely didn't want to lose it. I am never having biological children, because if I had to be home with them I would legitimately lose it.  \n\nYou're not wrong.", "NTA for stating being a SAHP isn\u2019t for everyone. It isn\u2019t. I know I\u2019d go insane and hate it if I had to be a SAHM. That\u2019s not a mean statement, that\u2019s fact. It is not for everyone. End of story.", "INFO: What is the relevance of SAHM here? \nYou are in school full time.", "> And she thinks that I have told her she directly can\u2019t handle being a SAHM and is taking it so personal. \n\nIf that's not what you meant to say, you should apologize, because that's the only way to interpret it.", "Yes. I hate the comparison too. \n\nHer comment seemed to belittle your schooling vs being a SAHM. Do you do school from home? You said you had a month off from SCHOOL and that is when she said \"you're always off because you're always home\". It was more like saying - you don't go anywhere for work/school, you're always home, and I cleaely don't see school as work. That was more of a comment on your SAHM school than being a SAHM mom. \n\nWhich we all know, whether it's school or work from home, it's different when we have no other responsibilities/obligations besides parenting. I work from home a lot, but certainly a month off from work is much more relaxing than having to work/meet deadlines. I also was working on my masters from home, and damn straight it was nice to have a break inbetween classes, even if I didn't go anywhere for classes. Very different. \n\nI hate the comparison shit. But your comment was uncalled for and irrelevant. You could have addressed the work you were doing while in school, because it seems she didn't appreciate how much effort that was taking because it was done at home (classes, reading, homework, tests, projects, whatever). Made the point about how that is a lot of work, even if done at home, and  having a break from that will be really nice. \n\nSome people can't be a SAHM for financial reasons. They shouldn't belittle your experience or you because you don't work outside of the home, but it's also shitty to make it seem like it's their choice or they couldn't handle it. Personally I do like working, but primarily it's a financial thing so would be upset if someone made a comment as if its a choice for me or I couldn't \"handle\" being a SAHM.  I absolutely would NEVER judge or make comments about someone who doesn't work, or choses not to work,  is a SAHM. Etc. I don't act like they have it easy or don't deserve a break. Just sayin'", "NTA\n\nMore power to the women who do it. It is one of the most underappreciated job. I don't know the 2022 stats for the US, but usually an article goes out, if we paid SAHP (using parents) the going rate for all the jobs they actually do rarely is the annual salary under $100,000 (US) per year. Especially since Moms (more often than dads) are never off duty.\n\nI know that I could never do it.", "NTA. It was okay for her to undermine what you do, but it isn\u2019t okay for you to undermine that not all folks can do it? Wtf", "NTA - she could\u2019ve just minded her own business and let you do your thing without making negative comments about it. You finally set a boundary and she\u2019s thrown off guard", "NTA. You are right that not all women can handle it. More importantly, even if they can, not all should. My mom was amazing at it. I would've lost my mind if I didn't go talk to adults about non-kid stuff. I am a much better mom because I work outside of the home.\n\nDue to several reasons, my husband became a SAHD for several years and was amazing at it. He did the majority cooked, cleaned, did laundry, handled emergencies, etc... Yes, I \"could have\" because I would do anything to take care of my kids but we were all happier and healthier this way. When I got home, I helped with all the household chores as it was a partnership.\n\nMy kids are kind, polite, successful college students. They earned full-ride scholarships and have career goals. I know kids with SAHMs who are absolute terrors. Parenting is about emotional engagement, not physical location.", "ESH. She was actually disparaging being a full-time student. Neither of you are SAHMs, unless your definition includes working from home, which it shouldn\u2019t. Your response didn\u2019t actually have anything to do with what she was insulting and was a separate insult if it\u2019s own.", "NTA.  She started it. You ended it.", "Don\u2019t perpetuate the Mommy Wars. I know SIL has been needling you. But retaliating will just make things worse, as you can see. She feels envious, and she feels bad that she has to/wants to work. All of us have doubts about our decisions, but we don\u2019t all take them out on others. My advice is to keep it light and respond with comments like, \u201cEveryone is different.\u201d \u201cThat must be rough.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re having a hard time.\u201d", "Working moms do what you do but also work. Being a stay at home mom is a luxury most can\u2019t afford.", "NAH neither of you are really SAHMs. You both sound like you're working very hard and are stressed. Both situations have pros and cons and you should not compare yourselves to one another. Doesn't sound like anyone is being malicious, but should discuss directly how the things you say makes one another feel instead.", "NTA. I hate it when moms judge other moms for what they do or don\u2019t do outside of the home. You gave her a snarky remark because she was tearing you down.", "Slight ESH. \nShe is diminishing your life choices and with your comment so did you. \nBeing a SAHM is hard, but being a working mom is way harder. \nYou have to work AND usually do everything else.\n\nThe fact that you are staying at home is a privilege, one that many people don't have.", "NAH.\n\nYou're not employed, but you are a full-time student who takes care of 2 young children full time as well.  There's LOTS of people who couldn't handle that, and it doesn't have anything to do with your lack of a paycheck.  It's not about being a SAHM.\n\nHer response is typical for a person who has gone back to work and would just like some extra days off.  She'd probably say something similar if you had a WFH job.\n\nInstead of focusing on the SAHM mom aspect, I'd be more like:  \"Sure, you try taking five college courses and keeping your grades up while taking care of 2 babies and see how easy it is.", "NTA\n\nShe attacked you, you answered back.\n\nOn a separate note. If what you say is true you are definitely not lazy: you are even exploiting every drop off your time with your babies to build your future", "NTA you weren't judging her she took it that way thats on her. She had been ragging on you this entire time.\nBtw Stay At Home Parents have the most demanding boss and when you look to get feedback from this boss they give you shit literally shit.", "NTA, you are not a SAHM, you are also a student.  Frankly,  that sounds incredibly difficult to me. That's two jobs. You have a lot going on and both take up time and effort.  She likely has her own issues and isn't looking internally atm.", "NTA\n\nNot everyone can handle being a stay at home parent. It poses unique challenges and is a difficult job. \n\nAnd unless you are leaving something out, she took a general statement personally, which is not really your fault. Best case, try to explain to her that you weren't talking about her specifically, but speaking about people in general. If she's still upset, then it's probably not about you. Normally people don't get that butthurt.", "YTA, can't \"handle\" having it easier????? Think about what you said. You're looking forward to a break in YOUR school lessons as a student. You're looking forward to ONLY being a SAHM!!!!!!!! \n\nOTOH, she has to do everything you do as a parent AND work. You even (should) know better as you say you once were a working parent! was harder, wasn't it? Be honest.", "Esh if you two can't be nice to each other you need to stop talking to each other.  You both seem like catty unhappy people.", "NTA but ESH softly  Just like you said opinions are like as*holes everyone has one. And that means to keep your opinions to yourself. \n\nSometimes its better to just agree to disagree.  This is one topic that needs to be off the table to be discussed especially with friends and family. Save your sanity. \nYou and your sister will never see eye to eye especially on this topic ..", "You are NOT wrong. No way in hell I could handle being a SAHM. I would NOT have made it. Kudos to you for handling kids and school!!", "NTA.  All moms are different.  My mom was a SAHM while I have always worked, but that doesn't mean my daughter was any less taken care of (she is now 22).  It sounds like you both have full plates, her with work and you being home with your children and going to school.  Every household and family are different and as long as it works for that particular family, there should be no comparisons made.  You SIL needs to pull her head out of her ass and realize that just because you are home, doesn't mean you are off.", "NTA it\u2019s true, too. I\u2019m a SAHM with one kid and have loved it. My sister has four and her now-ex was a SAHD. She would not have been able to cope staying home. Even maternity leave felt too long for her. She worked in childcare, so it was about the social interaction (or lack of) mostly.", "NTA, I don\u2019t even have kids yet and know that I could never handle being a SAHM. I\u2019d lose my mind tbh. Good for you for standing up for yourself!!! And kudos for doing school and raising your babies, can\u2019t be easy!", "NTA, but I do know that the \u201chandle\u201d part is very open to interpretation. That said, stop interacting with her except when absolutely necessary. She sounds jealous or petty or like she is struggling with something, but no matter what it is, she is determined to make it a competition. You won\u2019t win this without drawing blood (metaphorically, of course). \n\nI had zero desire to be a SAHM, and I couldn\u2019t do it anyway as a single parent - handle it? Maybe, maybe not, but it wasn\u2019t feasible or desired for me. That doesn\u2019t diminish your choices or the choice to return to work. Also, while my kid is almost middle-school age, I recently did full time work, part time Master\u2019s, and parenting - it\u2019s hard AF, but I\u2019m neither better nor worse than any other parent who is doing their best.\n\nThe Mommy Wars suck. To show my age, I\u2019ll quote the movie \u201cWar Games\u201d and just say that the only way to win is not to play.\n\nAs an aside - well done on school + littles! It\u2019s a lot, and good luck as you continue!", "NTA. SAHM is without a doubt probably the hardest job to have because you have way less freedoms than someone who goes to work during the day. At least at a normal job, you can go on break, maybe stop for take out on the way home, but when you're at home all day with children going out is 10x more difficult and takes twice as long to run simple errands. Also, kids are a lot. It's not their fault they're a lot, they're just kids. And motherhood looks different for everyone! There is no shame for being a SAHM or a working mom, as long as ends are being met and everyone is happy. Being a SAHM is also NOT AN OPTION for most people as the cost of living continues to rise and salaries continue to stay the same.", "You\u2019re not a SAHM. Going to school is much harder than a job and you\u2019re doing it with no childcare. \n\n**You are literally a working mom with no childcare.** That\u2019s incredibly difficult. \n\nThat said, any mommy wars type competitions are stupid.
