We were roommates, adopted a dog together, and lived together since college until our mid/late twenties (married at 24 and 25). However, we were never actually romantically involved. She was not interested in marriage and also questioning her sexuality at the time, but her family was ultra-traditional (and messy for many other reasons) and kept pushing for her to \"settle down\". I had just gotten out of a rough long term relationship, and we kind of just both said fuck it, we basically were kind of living like a married couple, lets get married for convenience. So we did the paperwork for it, but we never had a wedding. We were also never romantically involved. She just was not my type and I was not hers. My family knew she wasn't my wife in the traditional sense (they did HEAVILY disapprove though). \n\nWhen I started getting back into the dating scene, we split up and legally divorced. She remains one of my close friends to this very day, and I care for her a lot. It's been a few years, and I am now 32 with a lovely fiance who I cannot wait to marry. However, ever since I announced the engagement my family has been making weird comments, like:\n\n\"Oh, so Roxie's (my dog) is getting a new step-mom!\"\n\n\"Wife #2 at 32 huh? That's a lot of wives for your age!\"\n\n\"Let's hope this 2nd one lasts!\"\n\nIt makes both me and my fiance uncomfortable. I keep on saying that my close friend wasn't really my wife in the traditional sense, but my family brushes me off by saying that they're just joking, or she's technically my second wife anyway so it's not like they're wrong. Today at breakfast though, I blew up at them and called them disrespectful and rude for belittling my relationship. My mom and my sister both said that if I didn't want to hear these statements, I shouldn't have married my close friend.

I think it's incredibly disrespectful to imply that OP is unfaithful or a bad partner because of one divorce, especially considering the whole marriage was to help the friend! That does NOT imply any such thing, in fact I think it says the opposite, that you're a very caring individual who will go to great lengths for the people you care for.

I think you'll find that the reason a lot of queer people fought for marriage equality was for all the legal benefits of marriage.", "I don\u2019t think OP is wrong for being upset with his family when he\u2019s asked them to drop the topic, but couldn\u2019t he have helped his friend without actually filling out the paperwork so that she wasn\u2019t really his wife?", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

They didn\u2019t even get to see their sons first wedding etc.", "I mean, let\u2019s not pretend that we think the rules of some random culture should have any bearing on how people in OP\u2019s life react. You can\u2019t get married for bullshit reasons in your own culture, then be like \u201cwell actually in 1800s insert-country-here marriage was for political and status reasons\u201d and expect your family and friends to think that\u2019s completely sensible.", "But that\u2019s the best kind of correct! /s", "Yeah it's petty. They didn't approve of marriage #1 so now they're using this time to really drive it home and punish OP for it, instead of being excited that they are getting what they wanted for him originally -  a \"real\" marriage. (Though honestly you can marry for whatever reasons you please, it's your life and no one else's business)", "That's more than petty, it's disrespectful and hurtful.", "NTA\n\nYour family seems to have a hard time respecting boundaries. They brought upon themselves your outburst and threat. It's up to them to decide whether they want to be respectful or not.", "Why is it objectively stupid?", "I don't blame them for disapproving. I grt having different values and clashing over them. I just think it gives context and drives what the intent behind their comments is. These aren't comments said in fun, as a gentil ribbing, or to just give OP a hard time. These are comments meant to drive home their disapproval of the first marriage and are meant to be cutting while the family can fall back on them being \"jokes\".\n\nThat is what I meant behind this being what tipped OP into being NTA for me. While he cannot just hide from his previous decisions and act like this is his first marriage, I understand why he blew up at them and feel it is an appropriate escalation since they are being malicious and disingenuous.", "But you also argued the opposite, saying you were on the fence. I don't think the family is right at all.", "You said: \u201cYou didn\u2019t care enough about the title of being your first wife when you gave it to your friend, I don\u2019t know why you care that your fianc\u00e9 doesn\u2019t get to have it.\u201c\n\nBut the reason is obvious: they\u2019re using it to be demeaning and insulting.\n\nAnd so what if OP cares about the title itself? Maybe they don\u2019t respect an in-name-only marriage that was legally registered but never had a ceremony and was never consummated. What\u2019s wrong with that?", "I do think OP\u2019s family is out of line for constantly bringing up when he\u2019s asked them not to, but I am confused by this part of the story too. Maybe I\u2019m missing something, but if it truly was just to appease the friend\u2019s family, wouldn\u2019t it have made more sense to NOT do the paperwork and just have a \u201cfake,\u201d traditional wedding?", "Glad it\u2019s not common in your area! But around me I know dozens of couples who are either in loveless marriages or divorced now because of this. Have had at least 5 family members do it.", "Okay, so you clearly know what i meant and found what I meant though, Jan.", "Alriiiighty. My comment was about how it was \u201cthe stupidest thing I read today\u201d but okay.\n\nFamily should be supporting OP\u2019s marriage instead of making shitty remarks", "I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m not OP. I don\u2019t know either of their family\u2019s to know the pressure they were facing. I think its stupid to constantly make snide remarks about a second marriage when they knew the first one didn\u2019t matter. If they were so mad about it why are they being assholes about this one?", "Was your buddy and their partner ok with it though? Did they ever ask you to stop, or seem uncomfortable? If no, great, it's all in good fun! But OP did ask his family to stop. OP and his fiance aren't having fun. They aren't being laughed with, they're being laughed at.", "It's fine the first time, once he made it clear he's not comfortable they should stop.", "Also, I\u2019m America it is extremely common for friends to get married to share benefits. Like one has healthcare and the other can\u2019t afford but has cancer so they get married to share that and get tax breaks. In a lot of states just living together for x amount of years classifies you as married.\n\nThey were married for convenience so yea, technically she\u2019s his first wife in legalese but not in heart and family should back off when he expressed hurt from their jokes", "OP says they know she is technically his 2nd wife and just wants the comments to stop\u2026. They talked to them and they didn\u2019t stop", "The braindead is calling him an asshole. Yes he was married that is a fact it\u2019s also a fact that he asked his family to stop bringing it up because it bothered him. They continued. They are the assholes. Your take is braindead.", "Are you kidding? You don't think marrying a platonic friend for shits and giggles is a bad idea?", "Oh I agree, there was nothing wrong with the marriage. Their reasons for it don't matter.\n\nIt's the being so butthurt that is insane. Ignore them or don't go around them.", "OP also stated that it shouldn't count as a marriage since they were romantically involved, still doesn't work that way legally. Granted in some cultures and religions it would need to be consummated to count.\n\nIf he can't handle his family's comments, don't go around them.", "So family has never teased you about anything? Hmmm sadly I find that hard to believe.", "Boo hoo", "It wasn't for shits and giggles. It was to protect her from her homophobic family. He did a noble thing.", "How was it for shits and giggles? He got his friends family off her back while she struggled with her sexuality, and they presumably got some tax benefits too.", "It wasn\u2019t for shits and giggles it was to placate a pushy homophobic family. Try and keep up.", "They don\u2019t want to cut out his entire family when family could just stop being insensitive", "And in America it really doesn\u2019t count. Again\u2026 I have health benefits at my job and can marry a friend so they can use my benefits\u2026 technically I got married, but it was a marriage of convenience\u2026 so while sure the next person I marry is technically my 2nd wife, in my heart she really wouldn\u2019t be\u2026.\n\nYou are getting so friggin fixated on that one part, and not where OP says they spoke with them and asked them to stop and they continued\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s bullying, they asked them to stop, said the comments were offensive, and asked them to stop. OP is NTA at all here. Technically it\u2019s the truth but as soon as they asked them to stop and they didn\u2019t they became AHs", "And if they don't stop when you make it clear they are hurting you, you cut them out of your life. Family relationships are not a license to be abusive. My uncle found that out when he got cut from holiday gatherings in 2016. Nobody in my immediate family has seen or spoken to him since. FAFO.", "Pretty sure it's not only stupid to marry just for tax benefits but illegal too. But yeah great idea to change your marital status (twice, counting the divorce) just to placate a couple of bigots \ud83d\udc4d", "Then he chooses to put himself in this environment, since it seems they aren't going to.", "Exactly, if you don't like it don't put yourself around it.", "Really? What law says the married couple has to be in love or have sex? Defrauding immigration authorities is one thing, I don't see any sign that took place here.", "Well you\u2019re wrong on both points. \n\nFirst, marriage for tax benefit purposes is not illegal in the US. Marriage is marriage for the IRS. You\u2019re thinking of for immigration. That\u2019s illegal. \n\nSecond, you must live a very very sheltered life if you think that those \u201ccouple of bigots\u201d couldn\u2019t or wouldn\u2019t harm their daughter if she came out or did anything too untraditional.  If she didn\u2019t feel safe, placating those bigots could be a matter of life or death, without hyperbole.", "Why do you care lol, do you believe in the sanctity of marriage or some rubbish?\n\nDude sounds like a great friend. You sound like a bit of a knob.", "It is not illegal", "Would you be able to complete go no contact with your parents? \n\nI feel like Reddit users always say \u201cgo no contact\u201d like it\u2019s the easiest thing\u2026 my mom is kinda toxic but I just give her space till she calms down. I could never not talk to her ever again.", "Right. And the reason to do that is because they are being assholes.", "I love how it went from they got married for shits and giggles, to got married to appease of couple of bigots. Which is it?", "lol sorry, you're asking 'why do you care' on a sub that's created specifically for people asking to be judged? Not the sharpest are you?\n\nEDIT: Aw, the old reply-and-block? Seems like someone cares a little more than they let on :)", "lol then why does OP care about the jokes if he didn't care about the sanctity of marriage?", "I could, I was LC with my dad for years and he lived less than a 2 minute walk from me.", "I'm asking why do you care about changing marital status, as I assumed was clear by the context and rest of the sentence.\n\nJust gonna block you now, you're thick as pig shit", "Well, if it wasn\u2019t obvious who the asshole was before, we certainly have one here :)", "I\u2019m sorry you had to do that. I guess I don\u2019t what low contact really is. I keep in touch with my dads side of the family thru Facebook and if I am in the state make plans for dinner, they are racist, and recently pro trump anti vax so I just nod and smile when they go off on that stuff, but I could never cut them out completely \n\nI did lose my dad when I was 14 so feeling connected to them is a bit important for me personally."]}
