{"id": 19528, "submission_id": "146sj0r", "title": "AITA for lashing out at my family for calling my fiance my \"second wife?\"", "selftext": "Years ago, I was married to a close friend. We were roommates, adopted a dog together, and lived together since college until our mid/late twenties (married at 24 and 25). However, we were never actually romantically involved. She was not interested in marriage and also questioning her sexuality at the time, but her family was ultra-traditional (and messy for many other reasons) and kept pushing for her to \"settle down\". I had just gotten out of a rough long term relationship, and we kind of just both said fuck it, we basically were kind of living like a married couple, lets get married for convenience. So we did the paperwork for it, but we never had a wedding. We were also never romantically involved. She just was not my type and I was not hers. My family knew she wasn't my wife in the traditional sense (they did HEAVILY disapprove though).\n\nWhen I started getting back into the dating scene, we split up and legally divorced. She remains one of my close friends to this very day, and I care for her a lot. It's been a few years, and I am now 32 with a lovely fiance who I cannot wait to marry. However, ever since I announced the engagement my family has been making weird comments, like:\n\n\"Oh, so Roxie's (my dog) is getting a new step-mom!\"\n\n\"Wife #2 at 32 huh? That's a lot of wives for your age!\"\n\n\"Let's hope this 2nd one lasts!\"\n\nIt makes both me and my fiance uncomfortable. I keep on saying that my close friend wasn't really my wife in the traditional sense, but my family brushes me off by saying that they're just joking, or she's technically my second wife anyway so it's not like they're wrong. Today at breakfast though, I blew up at them and called them disrespectful and rude for belittling my relationship. My mom and my sister both said that if I didn't want to hear these statements, I shouldn't have married my close friend. I threatened to not invite them to the wedding, and now things are super tense. AITA?\n\nSome edits from the comments I made to help answer some common questions:\n\nWhy I married my close friend: Health insurance, mostly, but also because they kept holding her tuition over her head. We were both in grad school at the time (she was gunning for a PhD, I was going for a masters but I had a job in an energy commission with some benefits). They\u2019d always tell her that they\u2019d stop sending her money or (some months when the arguing was bad) not send her money at all. They used money to punish her, basically. She had a lot of health issues at the time that she couldn\u2019t get help for, like chronic pain and wisdom teeth that really needed to be removed, alongside some other personal issues. \n\nSo getting married got them off her back about her sexuality, got her on my health insurance plan, and got them to be more consistent on sending tuition money for her. There were a few other things too, like how they kept setting up potential arranged marriages for her or threatening to take her home to their country. There was also a time when they threatened to have her committed to a mental health facility.\n\nAt the time, she was also really reluctant on letting me help her beyond minor things because she felt like it was something she had to repay. So between us, it also gave me an \u201cexcuse\u201d to help her. I\u2019d be like \u201chey, it\u2019s what your spouse is supposed to do, right?\u201d Even though we both agreed that our marriage was a farce, I think it did something for her psychologically to accept that we had a legally binding relationship where I could help her. I don\u2019t know, it was complicated but it was something that worked for us. I was able to pay for her treatment and let her use my money for herself.She has now graduated and is financially stable. To my knowledge she no longer speaks with most of her family. She's doing amazing for herself and I am so damn proud of her.\n\nMy fiance: My fianc\u00e9 knows about my past marriage and has no issue with it. I met her through my close friend, actually, as a mutual of a mutual! At the time I was already split from my close friend, and while she was initially confused, me and my close friend both sat her down and explained things as clearly as possible. She understands why we did what we did.\n\nMy family: I was always 100% transparent with my family on my marriage with my close friend. My family understood that I went through a rough relationship before my marriage. I think my mom\u2019s exact words at the time were \u201cI won\u2019t force you to do anything, but I\u2019m really disappointed that you take marriage so lightly.\u201d They understood that I married my close friend to help her, but I also got the slight impression that they figured everything would sort itself out with our marriage (i.e. I would fall in love with her or something). My aunts and uncles didn\u2019t say much else than that they were disappointed that they couldn\u2019t attend a real wedding. When I met my fianc\u00e9, I told them how it was a big deal to me that it was my first, genuine, supportive romantic relationship in a long time. At the time, they all seemed happy for me and no comments like these came up. They told me they were glad I was able to find love again. It was only when we announced the engagement that these comments started.", "created_utc": 1686485941, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146sj0r/aita_for_lashing_out_at_my_family_for_calling_my/", "score": 9546, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There were a few other things too, like how they kept setting up potential arranged marriages for her or threatening to take her home to their country. There was also a time when they threatened to have her committed to a mental health facility. \n\nAt the time, she was also really reluctant on letting me help her beyond minor things because she felt like it was something she had to repay.

Getting married is a symbol that you're ready to take your relationship to the next step. The fact that OP married his previous wife so she can escape her family can be and is seen as a spat to the holy matrimony, what a marriage should be [in reality marriage is whatever you and your partner(s) make of it]. The family may have seen the previous wife as a gold digger or leech (the post did not make that clear so I have to consider that possibility).\n\nArranged marriages are not out of love. Depends on culture. In some, it's because they see daughters as burden and want to essentially make sure that they are properly taken care of. In others, it is a blessing to be married and arranged marriages make it easier. But there is some protection for the bride.

If you rented (or bought) a 4 bedroom house, and had 2 couples living there, each married, with BAH for the higher ranking member of each couple, the house & groceries were easily affordable. The military tried to crush this \"scandalous\" behavior, especially during the \"don't ask don't tell\" days, admonishing couples who \"didn't appear to love one another\" to come clean and be punished for their deceit, and oh, pay the government back. The whole thing was really laughable, especially during the Bill & Hillary years.....Why were they married again? At least one of them never appeared to be monogamous.
