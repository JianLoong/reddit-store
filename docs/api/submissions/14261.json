We've been meticulously planning our dream wedding, which is set to take place in three months. My sister, Mia (32F), has always been the competitive type and loves being the center of attention. Our relationship has always been rocky, but we've tried to maintain a decent connection.\n\nAbout six months ago, Mia met her now-fianc\u00e9, Chris (33M), and they got engaged three months later. I was genuinely happy for her and offered to help her plan her own wedding. However, she seemed disinterested and never really talked about it with me.\n\nFast forward to a week ago, when I received a call from my cousin. She told me that she just got an invitation to Mia's wedding and that it's scheduled for the *exact same day* as mine. I was in complete disbelief. I immediately called Mia to ask her about it, and she nonchalantly confirmed that she had indeed planned her wedding on the same day. She argued that it would be convenient for the family, so they wouldn't have to travel twice.\n\nI was furious and hurt. After discussing it with Tom, we decided to disinvite Mia from our wedding. I felt that she had crossed a line and disrespected the time and effort we put into planning our special day. Mia has since been playing the victim, saying that I'm overreacting and being petty.\n\nMy parents are now involved, and they're asking me to reconsider, saying that it's not worth creating a long-lasting rift between my sister and me. However, I can't help but feel betrayed and disrespected. Tom supports my decision but is also concerned about the impact on our families.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for disinviting my sister from my wedding after she planned her own on the same day?", "created_utc": 1680922811, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12f9978/aita_for_disinviting_my_sister_from_my_wedding/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus, your sister would claim that wearing a wedding dress to your wedding reception would be ok because after all, the sister is a bride that day. And judging from your parents being ok with both weddings on the same day, that they would be ok with her doing this.\n\nI\u2019m curious about your mom here- a BIG sentimental part of weddings is the bride getting ready with her mom.

She wouldn't be able to attend my wedding, and I wouldn't be able to attend hers either. It's like she intentionally created a situation where we would have to choose between each other's weddings, knowing it would put a strain on our family and friends. The fact that she chose the same date, despite knowing when my wedding was scheduled, makes it feel like a deliberate attempt to overshadow my special day or force our loved ones to pick sides.

I agree that if she had come to me with the idea and we had discussed it together, the situation might have been different, and we could have tried to find a solution that worked for both of us.

My wedding is scheduled for late afternoon, with the reception following in the evening. Mia's wedding, on the other hand, is planned for the morning, and she intends to have a separate reception in the early afternoon. This arrangement doesn't allow our family and friends to attend both weddings and receptions comfortably, as they would have to rush between the two events and likely miss parts of each.\r  \n\r  \nThe fact that she planned her wedding and reception so close to mine adds to the feeling that she's trying to overshadow my special day and force people to choose between our events.

The main reason I decided to disinvite her was to make a clear statement that I felt her decision to plan her wedding on the same day was unacceptable and hurtful.

The timing of her reception conflicting with your wedding sounds intentional to me.  I think I would recruit your parents to have her change her reception to be a joint reception for the two weddings if that is a possibility? and have it at the time you originally scheduled your reception for.  That makes more sense if she really means this to \"save\" your cousins and friends from having to make two trips.  It also makes sense if your parents are footing the bill for the receptions.  This also allows you not to have drunks at your wedding from your sisters reception.\n\nIf your parents are onboard with this, and your sister agrees to this, you should invite her and her new hubby to your wedding.", "Yeah this is where I'm coming from.

The reason I chose to disinvite her was more symbolic than practical. By disinviting her, I wanted to express my disapproval of her actions and the hurt she caused by planning her wedding on the same day as mine. It was a way for me to set boundaries and communicate that I found her behavior unacceptable, rather than passively accepting the situation she created.

And what exactly is the point in uninviting someone from a wedding they won't be attending anyway?\n\nI apologize if my explanation has been unclear or confusing. Let me try to clarify the situation. When my sister used the excuse of convenience, she was referring to the fact that both weddings would take place on the same day, so family members wouldn't have to make two separate trips on different dates. However, because of the close timing of the weddings and receptions, our loved ones are still forced to choose which event they can fully participate in, as they can't feasibly attend both without missing parts of each.\r  \n\r  \nAs for disinviting her, the decision to do so was more about taking a stand and expressing my disapproval of her actions than it was about the logistics of her attendance.

Why on earth should OP have to share one of the biggest moments of her life with someone that is trying to hurt her and steal away attention? It wouldn't surprise me if the sister is hoping to force OP to combine receptions and foot the bill for it so sister can save money and force her to share the attention. It's honestly disgusting her sister did this. I would not make any compromises to accomodate someone so self-centered and rude. And OP's parents are enabling the sister so hard here. They should have reemed out the sister and refused to attend her wedding at all of she insisted on keeping it on this day. Fuck that noise.
