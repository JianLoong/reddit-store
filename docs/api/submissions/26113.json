I've said multiple times that this should stop as it's unfair (he gets two, I get one), it's a lot of work for me, and he's always disappointed with whatever we do. So this year we agreed to only do it on the date of the country we live in.\n\nThis year I made an enormous effort for the date in the country we live in, the kids did too, and I spent a lot of money on it (over \u20ac300). Unrelated, but I wanted to go overboard with his birthday too, to \"soften the blow\" of dropping to one father's Day, so for his birthday which is a few months later (and he usually expects a birthday month) I seriously pulled out all stops: baking his favourite dishes, over \u20ac400 on presents, cards, you name it.\n\nYesterday, knowing that it's father's Day in the country we're from, I decided to break a rule and pick up a present for him. I told him as I needed the address, and without going into details he said I wouldn't be able to. So we agreed that he would, so when we were in town, I took the kids and he picked it up.\n\nNow that today is father's Day in the country we're from, I didn't wish him father's Day straight away, he said \"why do I have to remind you?!\", I straight away said it, and asked if I could make him breakfast, and what did he want to do today, then reminded him we agreed we wouldn't celebrate it.

Until they find themselves in a situation such as this one, they won't give much thought to gender inequality and sexism on the assumption that it doesn't affect them. And solidarity whether with women or other men is rarely a thing. \n\nPerhaps your husband has been hit with something he can't articulate yet. \nLike so many women before him, he may feel a bit trapped, bored, dependant on you and worried about his work life if he were to resume one in the future. \nWomen know about this, but very few men do. \n\nGood luck \ud83d\ude0a"]}
