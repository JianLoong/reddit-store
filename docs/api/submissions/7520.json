We are both in our late 20s now. She has a daughter (2f) and I have three kids 1f and 7f and an adopted son who is 18.\n\nMy friend brings her child over often to play with my 1 year old and to hang out with me. I don\u2019t mind at all. I love her baby. She is very aggressive all the time though. Constantly hitting and throwing things at my kids and dogs. It\u2019s easy to redirect her and my kids have learned how to stop her from hurting them in a nice and safe way. She has broken many toys of my kids. She rips the battery pack out of the rc cars. Pulls the hair and body parts off of the dolls. She threw my 7y olds tablet and shattered the screen. I\u2019ve told my kids multiple times to put away anything that they don\u2019t want broken and I feel it\u2019s ridiculous to have to do that. I\u2019ve spoken to my friend about the behavior and she always says she will watch her child and keep her from breaking things. She never does though. \n\nMy friend is low income. I don\u2019t say that in a bad way. I do believe the reason her child plays with toys the way she does is because she doesn\u2019t really have toys at home to play with.My husband has a PhD and I have a master\u2019s degree in computer science. We are able to buy whatever our children want honestly. They aren\u2019t spoiled, and they take care of their things, but I\u2019m getting so tired of having to rebuy the toys the child breaks over and over. \n\nFor Christmas my daughter asked for a giant race car track that you can rearrange the track and all that. It was on sale for 200 dollars so I got that as her big gift. I had it set up in the living room due to how big it was and the child was over for 20 minutes and broke the track pieces in half.\n\nAfter she broke the track I told my friend that she needed to buy my daughter another one because it was her favorite toy and it was too expensive to be replacing every time they came over. \n\nMy friend said I was the AH because I knew she didn\u2019t have the money to replace the toy. She said that I made more than enough money to replace it on my own and that I was over reacting over a \u201cstupid plastic race track\u201d. \n\nAnd before anyone comments on how I keep letting her bring the child over I want to say that I don\u2019t have the heart to tell her no. I love her baby. She\u2019s just aggressive and undisciplined. Her child has no interaction whatsoever unless it\u2019s with me and my kids. She\u2019s not I school and not in daycare since neither parent works. My kids love her too. I won\u2019t tell her not to bring the baby over.", "created_utc": 1673901166, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10dqpxh/aita_for_telling_my_low_income_friend_to_pay_for/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is not on your children to keep your friendship by putting up with the daughter.", ">I don\u2019t mind at all.\n\nOh, but you do. You don't like how she doesn't parent, you don't like how aggressive the child is, how she hits, throws things, breaks toys, gets into places you have gated off. You've had to teach your children \"how to stop her from hurting them in a nice and safe way\" (how does your 1-year-old do that, btw?).

Stop inviting her over, maybe she'll listen then.", "YTA, sorry but \u201cnot having the heart to tell her no\u201d to her bring her child over is not a good enough excuse.\nYou knew what her child was like and you knew this could be a risk. \n\nGet a backbone and tell her no to having her child over unless they behave themselves", "NTA but your just as responsible for this as she is. You know what happens whenever the child is around and that the mother won't stop her and refuse to set boundaries for them in your home and have never asked for payment in the past so no reason to ask now that it's something really expensive.", ">And before anyone comments on how I keep letting her bring the child   \nover I want to say that I don\u2019t have the heart to tell her no\n\nIn your own words \"I've told my kids multiple times to put away anything that they don't want broken.\"  How many times have you internalised that lesson?\n\nYTA.", "ESH; her for not controlling her kid and you for continuing to let her bring her kid over to destroy your kids' stuff. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result. For your kids' sake, I hope you get over your insanity.", "NTA, but you are never going to get that money.  Also, this should become a meet at the park friend.  That baby is unlikely to be able to destroy professionally installed playground equipment.", "YTA - I mean you knew the risk here. And it has happened before. You can\u2019t change that child\u2019s behavior or her mom\u2019s income, but you could stop letting them come over", "ESH.  Yes, the toy should have  been kept away from the child, however, your friend should be supervising her child more closely and not allowing her to break things (which is clearly happening on multiple occasions). Just because you can afford to replace it doesn\u2019t mean that you should have to. Your friend has a very poor attitude and is failing to teach her child to be careful.", "ESH. You need to step up here. Not to watch your \"friend's\" kid for her, but to protect the interests of your own family. This child may be sweet and lovable now but at this rate that isn't going to last. She is being raised with no boundaries, and that has nothing to do with income. You need to stop being a doormat and stop having these people over. Someone suggested meeting at parks instead. That's a great solution. Do that until one of two things happens: The child matures enough to understand \"no\" in your home, or she becomes completely unmanageable and you have no choice but to cut off her mother. The mother isn't going to become a better parent overnight, and in the meantime your own children are being affected. Stop letting that happen.", "YTA.  \n\n\nYou have to either stop inviting her over, or get used to paying for the things her child breaks when she comes over.  \n\n\nReally, you need to stop inviting her over, because you're putting your kids in the middle of this - they're the ones who have to put away their expensive toys so they don't get broken.  What lesson are you teaching your kids here?  Kids play differently, and have different energy levels, but at some point, your kids are going to decide enough is enough.", "So your children are getting punished because your friend can't teach her child to be gentle? \nYou aren't punishing them directly, don't get me wrong. But they are repeatedly having their things broken (things important enough to them that you feel the need to replace them), & being told that THEY should take measures to prevent this? \nYour children are young. They should enjoy it. Not be trying to prevent things the toddler's mother should be. \n\nESH. You for allowing this to happen for so long, at the detriment of your own children. And your friend for not correcting her child.", "YTA not because you requested she replace the toy but because you have allowed this woman who you refer to as a friend to disrespect your children\u2019s belongings, disrespect your caring nature but most importantly for allowing her to call you an asshole yet you still want her to come over and be in your home. You proudly state you refuse to bar her from your home so you have made your choice. Good job teaching your children to be doormats!", "YTA\n\nShe\u2019s repeatedly done the same things and you still let her around your kids. Also your friend, if she can\u2019t afford to pay for the broken toys etc then she should discipline her kid on how to act when she\u2019s in other peoples homes and if you continuously let them come over to your home knowing what the child is like tbf you shouldn\u2019t even be getting frustrated. You\u2019re at fault here too.", "YTA stop being a doormat and allowing another child into your house that damages toys and attacks your children and pets. WTF are you thinking?", "ESH, you for allowing it to happen, your friend for not teaching her kid or looking after her properly. By letting them in the house, you can already predict what's gonna happen. So take your own advice and put fragile toys away! Apparently in the whole house. I wonder why she can't take her kid anywhere else...?", "NTA, but if you know a toddler is known to be destructive, and you knowingly bring them in your house, you shouldn't be surprised when she then breaks things.  That doesn't justify it, because mom should do more to stop it, but it's just... what were you expecting to have happen when you left an expensive and fragile toy out?", "YTA.\n\nThe child is two. She doesn't throw things because she's a low-income kid without toys - she throws things because she's two. You had a breakable toy owned by your careful 7-year-old out in the room when you invited a toddler to come and play in it.\n\nThat was stupid.\n\nToddlers are basically Godzilla. There's a reason why people baby-proof their homes before inviting a toddler around. You didn't do this. \n\nYes, I understand that this is a big toy, and that your smaller child is calm and quiet, and doesn't go near her sister's toy. But you're still an idiot for having it out when the toddler came around.\n\nWhen I had toddlers in the house, the only toys that were out were ones that were toddler-proof. Anything delicate, or with small pieces, or which couldn't withstand a small person lumbering over to it and throwing it, eating it, or sitting on it had to stay in the older kids' rooms.", "NTA. The way the child is playing is NOT due to not having toys it\u2019s due to her parents not teaching her to be gentle.  Telling her to pay for it is not wrong but may end the friendship. If she says she\u2019s low income then tell her \u201cif you can\u2019t afford to pay for something you need to teach her to play gently\u201d or something. \n\nMaybe meet at her house for a change.   Did you give her kid any toys for Christmas?", "Info..so each time this holy terror breaks one of your child's possessions, what happens? Do you simply replace the item? Or do you blame your child for it being broken, and that item is trashed?", "Why can't you meet at a park or an indoor playcenter at the mall?", "YTA! \n\nAnd you\u2019ve enabled the bad behavior with no repercussions. \n\nOnce she escalates from the toys to your dogs or your children, then it\u2019s gonna be a different story.  \n\nHopefully you\u2019ll wake up, before that happens. \n\nBecause the fact that you\u2019ve now trained your children how to \u201cde-escalate\u201d her aggression, rather than dealing with that aggression is teaching them to be enablers.  \n\nHow can you not see the damage that you are doing?", "ESH.  Her for crappy parenting and you for having these people over.  Your poor kids.", "ESH\n\nWhat a great message you're sending to your older children that this toddler's tantrums take precedence over your children's safety and belongings. It's not about the money. Your friend needs to actually parent their child, and if not, they should not be allowed over. They've been warned multiple times. \n\nStand up for your kids.", "ESH. Your friend needs to parent her child, but your kids are going to resent you for forcing them to constantly deal with a child who breaks their toys.", "ESH. She should pay for what her kid broke. But seriously, as other commenters said, this is a \"meet at the park\" type of friend. Why are you letting this other mom supervise your kids together? Can you trust her to watch your kids and make sure this one doesn't throw things at your 1 year old or hit her? You need to protect your kids, above all else.", "On this one gonna  have to say you are well aware of the kids issues with breaking things and chose to have her continually come over anyway.  All the other boundaries this kid doesn't have you're ok with it and suddenly you want a boundary with it?  you've enabled this to be ok well before now.  So you either have to set up boundaries moving forward or let the broke toy go.", "YTA\n\nYou are teaching your kids that someone breaking their stuff is their fault and not the fault of the person who broke it.  They should not have to put their toys away to stop them being broken.  Your friend should teach her daughter to respect other people's toys.  If she doesn't do that and you keep inviting them around, then it is on you when things get broken.\n\nYou want them in your house... you make it so that she won't break stuff.  That is not your children's responsibility in their own house.\n\nYou say your kids love her but have you asked them?  Do they enjoy playing with her?  Do they want to interact with her or are you forcing the interaction?\n\nYou say she's not in school or daycare due the parents not working - there are free clubs out their for kids, other activities like going to the park where kids learn to interact.  Do not make your kids the only similar age activities she has.  She will never learn socialization like that.  You also run into the risk of turning your childern into her 'emotional support friends'.", "NTA Your friend should pay for it, even if it\u2019s only a little something a week until it\u2019s repaid. Moving forward I would suggest bringing your children to her house or sticking to meeting at parks, playing outside if you have a yard, whatever you have to do to keep her child from destroying more of your children\u2019s toys. \nIf your friend refuses to pay and can\u2019t discipline her child properly then it might be time to move on from the friendship. It can be hard to admit that you\u2019ve outgrown someone but it sounds like you have, in my opinion. While it might hurt now think of how bad you\u2019ll feel if her child throws something and causes permanent damage to your 1 year old.", "NTA.\n\nI know people are gonna be on your ass about still bringing over your friend and her kid, but I get where you\u2019re coming from. Everybody\u2019s got problems of one kind or another and poverty tends to exacerbate it. However, you do need to set some boundaries for your friend. 2 year olds are notoriously hard to control, but it can\u2019t always be *your* problem when your friends kid is the instigator 100% of the time.\n\nYour friend should pay for the track. And (I\u2019m gonna be going against the grain here), if she really can\u2019t afford it, you at least need to make sure she is taking real steps to improve her daughter\u2019s behavior before another play date. Because right now, financial issues aside, it\u2019s unfair to your kids to make them deal with their toys getting broken. If it happened once or twice, it could be a teachable moment of some kind, but they shouldn\u2019t be dealing someone else\u2019s kid constantly hitting them and breaking toys. That\u2019s the only area where I can call you an AH.", "NTA. But if your \"friend\" will turn on you that quickly, she doesn't seem to be much of a friend.", ">She\u2019s just aggressive and undisciplined\n\nShe's 2. YTA.", "NTA.\n\nI'd be mortified if my kid broke other kids expensive stuff, low income or not. \n\nYour friend is the asshole not necessarily for not being able to replace it, but for that \"oh it's only a plastic race track\" reaction she gave after she knows her kid has *repeatedly* broke other your kids stuff. \n\nShe not only needs to learn how to keep tabs on their kid better (I mean it's a 1 year old, it's not like the baby is going upstairs to go nuts with the other kids while you guys have coffee, the kid should be in the same damn room), but also needs to *learn the value of things*.\n\nI would stop inviting her round, to be honest - start meeting at a neutral location like a park or soft play.", "Not a judgment, but a potential solution. Is the entire track broken or just one or two pieces that you assemble? You might be able to contact the company and get just those pieces replaced.  And start meeting at a playground instead.", "YTA\n\nA two year old is going to break shit - that is NORMAL. Two year olds are aggressive and undisciplined - they aren't soldiers. They are two years old FFS. It is developmentally expected. If you agree to have a two-year-old in your home, you need to put things away that can be broken. The RC car shouldn't be within reach - that is not a safe toy for a 2 year old. Your child's tablet should not be in reach (and with a 7 year old, should be in a drop-proof cover anyhow). \n\nIt isn't up to your children to put this stuff away if they otherwise would have it out - it is up to you as the person who invited a 2 year old into your home. \n\nWhy was no one watching this child while they destroyed the train track? Why was the child allowed in the living room? Sure, the parent should have been watching, but so should you. You knew there was a fragile toy there and still let the child go there unsupervised?\n\nIf you don't want stuff broken by a NORMAL 2 year old doing NORMAL 2 year old behavior, YOU make sure it is put away, YOU make sure the child is supervised at all times, or YOU don't invite them over.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I just watch my kids. If the track wasn\u2019t so big it would have been in 7yo room.", "I don\u2019t blame my children. When she breaks something I will go over and pick up whatever it is and if it\u2019s fixable I\u2019ll fix it and if not then I\u2019ll throw it away. I usually will explain to her how not playing nice with the toys will cause them to break and that we can\u2019t play with broken toys etc. she\u2019s two so sometimes she gets it and sometimes she couldnt care any less. She\u2019s pretty understanding for the most part, but she does just end up acting the same way again. I try not to involve her mom because I know she\u2019s just going to spank her and I hate that. We don\u2019t have to debate on if spanking is ok or not, I just don\u2019t like it. If her mom does get involved and does spank her she is so aggressive and angry afterwards and it usually causes her to break and destroy more things.", "They don\u2019t de-escalate her aggression. They remove themselves from her aggression when it happens. My kids are fine bud.", "I\u2019ve raised 3 kids. There is a difference in being a 2 year old and being aggressive and undisciplined. This child has scratched her parents car with a rocks multiple times. She\u2019s beat the shit out of her cat at home to the point her mom rehomed it. She\u2019s spits in your face and slaps/hits/punches you. She has tossed my other friends 1 month old baby into the floor from her mamaroo and I could go on. You can\u2019t use \u201cshe\u2019s two\u201d to justify her bad behavior. She is undisciplined.", "I didn\u2019t think of that. Thank you.", "No I was just mad. I\u2019m over it now.", "I think you should reflect on what lessons you\u2019re teaching your own children by continuing to allow someone into your home, their private space, who is constantly wrecking their possessions. Whether or not you can replace these things is largely irrelevant IMO.", "Stop being weak. Your kids deserve better.", "Either accept broken things or stop inviting them", "Then rally shit up as get over it. She broke it, won\u2019t pay for it and it\u2019s YOUR FAULT if and when it happens again.\n\nDon\u2019t come online and ask a bunch of strangers if you\u2019re the asshole, because YES YOU ARE.\n\nESH", "Idk but it feels like your frustration is as much with your friend's parenting as it is with the broken toy. Maybe more so even?  You're not an asshole for asking her to replace it. But it sounds like you could easily pay for it and your friend is frustrated by that. And you're frustrated with your friend because she can't but also doesn't do anything to avoid the problem in the first place. \n\nI suggest to have an open talk with her about the situation in general and then take it from there.", "Yeah but what consequences have you given your friend? Still allow them over so they can play with your kids and continue to break things?\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t understand how you taught your 1 year old to protect themself? Please explain.", "It's not even about letting them in the home. Why are you putting a 1 year old baby in reach of items like RC toys or a train set or tablet? Those things aren't safe for a baby and at that age they don't have motor control. Baby should be in a baby play area with suitable toys. Not saying you have to segregate the baby and go overboard with baby proofing, but that's just too young to be around expensive electronics.", "Stop being weak and protect your damn children and pets from this feral child. It\u2019s a shame that your friend hasn\u2019t done a better job with her child but at this point it\u2019s a burden you\u2019re forcing the rest of your family to bear, and that\u2019s unfair.", "At least after this you won't ever see her again.  I'm sure she cab skip a few meals or sell something to pay you back", "You aren't the parent, though. She is. And she's shown time and again she just doesn't care enough to instill boundaries or discipline in her child.", "It\u2019s not your problem how other people\u2019s kids learn how to behave.\n\nYou say you blame her mom which is fair, but you keep allowing them back to your home, this whole situation wouldn\u2019t have happened if you did not allow them inside which you have every right not to.", "You could go to a park or playground. You do not need to host a destructive child in your home just so she can socialize.", "So exactly what are you and the mom doing in your house while the little girl is destroying stuff?  Are neither of you in the same room as the toddler? Are you paying attention while the kid grabs and breaks stuff? Also, is there a reason why you can\u2019t keep a few toys at your house for this kid to play with since she is a frequent visitor? I have kids, and most of their toys are broken - sometimes within the first hour they get them. That\u2019s what kids do. They break stuff. Anything you don\u2019t want to be broken needs to be put away. That\u2019s really the only way to protect it.", "You are either very kind  or like being the saviour regardless of the outcome. Put you own kids first and meet them in a park or soft play, it would be cheaper to pay for the kid than replacing broken stuff", "How are YOUR children going to learn to set proper boundaries if you won\u2019t? Is her child\u2019s health and growth more important than your own?", "They shouldn't, because YOU SHOULD HELP PUT THEM AWAY.  A 7-year-old is a little young to be responsible for that all on their own, and likely doesn't know how expensive the racetrack was.", ">The mom should watch her child. \n\nShe\u2019s proven she won\u2019t though. So you\u2019re allowing this child to come in and destroy your children\u2019s stuff all the time because you \u201cdon\u2019t have the heart to tell her no.\u201d Maybe it\u2019s time to stop placing some other kid above your own children? \n\nESH. Your friend for her abysmal parenting, and you for allowing this to continue happening in your house. The second that child physically assaulted one of your kids/dogs, she should have been permanently banned from your house unless and until her mother *seriously* corrected her behaviour. And no, moving on from physical assault to breaking others people\u2019s possessions is not correcting her behaviour.", ">I feel like my kids shouldnt have to worry about their thing being broken.\n\nFair, but why give them the rule then and why keep inviting them over when you know a potential bill that your friend can't afford may be sent her way?", "You're right. Your children shouldn't have to worry about their things being broken. You, as the parent and the person inviting a 2 year old into your home, should put their things away so they don't get broken, or supervise the 2 year old so there is no opportunity to break things.\n\nWatching the child is a joint effort. It's your home. You know what fragile stuff there is and where the child should and should not go.", "Then\u2026. Don\u2019t invite her over. Doesn\u2019t sound like much of a friend", "They shouldn\u2019t, but you\u2019re the one who keeps inviting these people into your home.", "How do your kids feel about their toys being broken all the time? Because this kind of reads like your priority is with your friend and her kid and not with your children.  Your children shouldn't feel like they and their stuff isn't as important as your friend.", "Your house is not toddler-proof, because a toddler climbed over the gate into the room that you thought was safe. \n\nThe gate works to keep your baby out. It doesn't work to keep this larger two-year-old girl out, because she's bigger and stronger than your baby.", "Sounds like your friend opened the gate and allowed her daughter in to \u201cplay\u201d\n\nI am sorry to say but you sound like a mug putting up with this. You are not protecting your children or your dog enough, what if she hurt someone while you were outside with your husband. You are also sending a message to your own kids that there is no consequences for breaking other peoples stuff.\n\nI don\u2019t think your friend is really a friend. Join a parents club and meet other parents", "So, you do not replace the toys if they aren't repairable?", "Not sure what country you are in that it is acceptable to spank children in 2023. You would help the kid more by reporting abuse", "how your children loves this agressive child is beyond me.", "What you're describing isn't naughtiness, it's RAGE. A baby with that much rage and aggression is trying to communicate something that she doesn't have the vocabulary or even self-awareness to express in other, healthier ways. I'm not saying it doesn't need to be addressed, but that kind of constant, aggressive rage from a 2-year-old isn't normal, and it doesn't require \"discipline\", it requires a psychological assessment (and probably a home assessment) because no child that young should be that angry all the time that they are breaking everything in sight and aggressively attacking every living thing they come in contact with.\n\nThat poor child isn't \"undisciplined\" - no 2-year-old has that much aggression without there being something very wrong. Jesus. Yes, she needs to stop, but the answer isn't punishment, it's trying to figure out why she's so destructive in the first place.", "No. She's 2. Doing normal 2 year old stuff. Not one thing you mentioned is unexpected behavior for a 2 year old. Why is she allowed to have a rock? Why is she allowed to be alone with a cat? Why is she allowed to be around a 1 month old baby unsupervised. \n\nThe adults are failing that child. That includes you if you are a supervising adult - which you are when it is your house.", "My 1 year old turns 2 in February. She plays with stuff like this under my supervision. It\u2019s not unsafe for her.", "I do. Just depends on what it is. I\u2019m not going to go rebuy a pack of phase 10 cards that my kids have never touched a single time in their life just because she ripped up some of the cards.", "I\u2019m in the southern part of the us so it\u2019s unfortunately still acceptable here. She has lost custody of the child already. I had fostered her for 9 months last year. She was fine the entire time. As soon as she went back to her mom she started acting this way again.", "She\u2019s not aggressive 24/7.", "Ok so I know I sound defensive but let me explain. When I say undisciplined I dont mean that she needs to be punished for all of these things she is doing. I\u2019ve talked to her mom before about bringing her to a child behavioral therapist because I knew that it isnt normal for her to act this way. I also don\u2019t mean that her mom doesn\u2019t \u201cpunish her\u201d. IMO the way she handles these situations is ridiculous and unhealthy. I don\u2019t believe in spanking children and I know that\u2019s a wild topic, but I don\u2019t see how you can hit a child for hitting another child. Her punishment to her child for hitting my daughter was to spank her. That only made her more angry and more aggressive. When I say she needs to be disciplined I mean she needs to be disciplined in a healthy way. I don\u2019t believe she would be as angry and aggressive all the time if she were disciplined in a healthy way. I don\u2019t mean that she needs to be a perfect little angel 24/7. She should be able to at most learn not to break toys though. I know it\u2019s not an immediate thing, but my 1 year old knows that if she doesn\u2019t take care of her toys then I\u2019ll throw the broken toy away.", "Well she\u2019s not my kid so I don\u2019t know why she was able to do all of that stuff, but I do agree with I should watch her while in my home. I do have other kids and other responsibilities though. I stepped out for a few minutes and her mother didn\u2019t notice that she had gotten over the baby gate.", "So your kid is basically 2, not 1. And the key word is *under your supervision*. Someone isn't supervising your friend's baby closely enough, and most babies that age aren't ok to play around RC toys etc. Your friend's baby clearly doesn't have the motor skill or understanding required, and by your account you've observed that repeatedly, yet you haven't made any changes", "Just curious what lessons your children are learning from all this. The value of a dollar, what behavior is acceptable at a guest's home, why their parent allows their home to be disrespected time and time again. I'm a childcare provider. I have cared for a wide range of children, and not once have I ever had a child that did not respond to appropriate. correction. A 2 year old absolutely understands the word, No. Bottom line, she's not being watched and cared for appropriately. Yet, according to your other comments, you allow your friend to \"watch\" your children, as well,  while you venture outside. Knowing full well, none of the children will be cared for. YTA for allowing this to continue for this amount of time, making excuses, and teaching your children that this type of behavior is acceptable, simply because you have the financial means to pay for the destruction you continue to allow..", "And while that happened, she damaged something that should have been put away or more heavily secured than a babygate that a 2 year old can get over. \n\nYour one year old should have been in the same baby-safe room as you, the mom, and the two year old. Your 7 year old is old enough to come to you if they needed something. Other than that, when you have guests, you shouldn't be taking care of other responsibilities. You both needed to stay put and watch the children. At those ages, it should be eagle eyes on them at all times. And since it is your home and you didn't adequately babyproof it, the onus is slightly more on you to help watch the 2 year old, especially since you know the history of them being a normal, reckless 2 year old.", "My kids have nothing to do with this. My kids are watched. My toddler stays with me and when I stepped outside she came with me. My house is babyproof as I have said before to you. I am able to take care of other responsibilities while having my children with me. I get that it\u2019s my home, but she is still not my child. Her mother was there so her mother should have watched her own child when I stepped out. \n\nAs far as you continuing to say she is a \u201cnormal\u201d two year old, she is not. No child should be this angry and aggressive all the time. If you think that is normal then you more than likely parent the same way as my friend. Toddlers are learning and they don\u2019t know how to regulate their emotions, but the level of aggression and anger this child has is not normal. It\u2019s not the child\u2019s fault either and I don\u2019t blame her. Her parents are failing her. You are making it out like I just don\u2019t like this child or something when that is not the case. I love her like she is my own, but she is not my own so I can not control how she is treated/raised/disciplined or whatever.", "It clearly isn't babyproofed if a two year old can get into a room you are trying to keep them out of. Babyproofed means you could leave a child alone in said room and nothing dangerous could happen.\n\nWhy are you stepping out with guests over?\n\nAnd yes - angry and aggressive is normal for a 2 year old. There is very little behavior that is abnormal for a 2 year old - because, you know - they are two. And you can't change how she is raised - but you can help supervise her when she is in your home knowing that her parent does not have the same supervision standards as you do, and knowing that you did not adequately prepare your home to have a 2 year old over.\n\nI would never DREAM of asking a friend to pay for damage their child did in MY home. Especially someone you \"love like your own.\"", "Nope it\u2019s definitely baby proofed. Her kid was able to climb over the gate. That doesn\u2019t mean the gate wasn\u2019t there. \n\nI stepped out with guest over because I\u2019m a grown ass man and I wanted to step outside. My husband was fixing a part on their car and I had stepped out to ask him a question about my daughters dance class. \n\nI\u2019m not going to argue with you over this child\u2019s behavior because you don\u2019t know this child and I promise my husbands PhD in this exact field is more relevant than your Reddit degree on two year olds. \n\nWhen I told her to pay for the track I was fully aware that she would never actually pay for it. I just wanted her to understand that her child is constantly breaking things and that she needs to keep it from happening. Clearly the only way to make her understand that was but telling her to replace what was broken. You also don\u2019t have to quote \u201clove like my own\u201d because you don\u2019t know us. I do love her. She deserves better.", "A gate that a child can climb over isn't babyproof. Like, by definition. An outlet cover that a child can pull out isn't babyproof either. Babyproof means that a child cannot get around/through/over it and that the child would be 100% safe being left alone in that environment.\n\nYes, those urgent dance class questions that can't wait or be sent via text ... always pulling me away from my guests.\n\nI'm sure your husband has a PhD in 2 year early child development and yet you guys can't figure out how to babyproof a home or know that you need to supervise a 2 year old. Uh-huh.\n\nWhy the hell would you treat a friend like that? Ask them to pay something to teach them a lesson? Just watch the child when they're in your home - problem solved. Or don't have the child in your home - go to a park. I guess you don't like having friends, because if I was this person, I would never be speaking to you again.", "I\u2019m starting to think you are this person lmao"]}
