Growing up bilingual is an awesome opportunity for her and could open many doors in her future.", "NTA. There\u2019s a very simple and easy solution/ compromise that many bilingual families employ for their young children. Your wife speaks to your child only in English and you speak to them only in Telugu. When your wife speaks to you she uses English and you respond in Telugu. That way you both get a little of what you want and more importantly, you BOTH foster your daughter\u2019s vocabulary and pattern recognition. Now that\u2019s teamwork. \n\nThere will be a learning curve where your daughter may mix the two languages together in sentences, but all you have to do is gently remind them to stick to one language when speaking. Also set the rule that she speaks English at school so she can show off how awesome her second language is as a surprise talent! The added benefit to this practice is that she can learn so many words in both languages as you and your wife speak to each other as essentially you two will BOTH act as real time translations. Children are sponges. No doubt she\u2019ll progress wonderfully if you choose to implement a 1 parent 1 language policy.\n\nAlso, not for nothing but it\u2019s kind of a shit move for your wife to ignore you when not speaking English, it\u2019s practically punishment for/ shaming the skill of being bilingual. Your daughter is going to pick up on that behaviour and may have unintended consequences unrelated to the language issue. She\u2019s going to see mom ignore dad. And that is the bigger issue (and also AH behaviour).", "NTA. \n\nPlease continue to speak Telugu at home. Your daughter is surrounded in an English speaking world. She will adapt. If she's only just speaking English now, then yes, it's to he expected she has some difficulties. Perhaps, as others have noted, a few sessions with a speech language pathologist wouldn't hurt. Heck, English is hard for some adults when it is their only language!", "NTA\n\nYour preschool teacher knows nothing about handling bilingual children and is giving bad advice. Find yourself some resources on best practices, because if you stop speaking Telugu at home now, your kid will never speak it fluently.", "NTA kids have very versatile brain and they can pickup different languages . Teacher was wrong to say only speak English with your child. My daughter speaks Tamil / Hindi at home , English /French at school .

The more immersion she gets at school the better her English will get.\n\nIf she\u2019s in preschool it probably means you\u2019re paying money for that preschool and now they\u2019re telling you how to parent? I would have a big problem with that. Feels like they are passing the buck to an extent. Shes 4. Have they even tried for very long to work on phonetics?\n\nConsider the story I am about to write below when you decide to stop speaking Telugu at home:\n\nA close childhood friend of mine is Italian on his fathers side.  His grandmother came to America as an adult and learned English here. She never bothered to teach any of her 3 sons how to speak Italian. When she got older she developed some pretty severe dementia and remarkably one of the first things she forgot was how to speak English. Her family could not communicate with her in her final days without a translator present. Private moments and private conversations all had to be witnessed by this translator who they obviously also had to pay.  These men couldn\u2019t speak to their own mother. \n\nI only speak English but if I get married to someone with a different mother tongue I will very strongly encourage them to speak in their native tongue for this reason. Nobody deserves to not be able to communicate with their own parents in their final days.\n\nFood for thought.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA. Your daughter will learn English just fine, and being fluent in two or more languages will be hugely beneficial for her.

Further, as someone who has taught English, it generally isn't necessary to speak English at home for a child to pick it up quite easily. If you're daughter is having a little trouble, speaking to her in English should be more than enough create a better foundation for her. Children, especially before the age of 5, are like sponges when it comes to language.\n\nAlso, other than minor errors, your English is quite good. Your wife choosing to speak to you in English when your daughter is with you would be one thing, but doing it all the time is another. You absolutely should focus on speaking English with her if needed, but don't just take the word of one teacher. Get her evaluated.

French and English. But I'm only bilingual in English because I was raised, for the first six years of my life, in a mostly English environment. Both my parents spoke French, they only ever used French with us, our mother going as far as only answering when we'd speak French to her, I went to school in French only and, yet, here I am, with my very decent English.\n\nThis is all to say that, no, unless Jia has issues even in Telugu, she does not need her environment to be entirely in English to master English pronunciation (phonics, I hate that word with a passion). She'll get there easily as she will be in a mostly English environment. I might get slightly faster but, frankly, at the huge expense of not being able to interact with her extended Telugu relatives among other things.", "Oh no. No, don't only speak English at home! One of the most wonderful things is to be able to speak a second language. Don't deprive your daughter of that!\n\nNTA.", "NAH. You want to speak your native language and there is nothing wrong with that. However, it is creating problems with your child who needs to learn to speak English fluently. The best option is to speak both English and Telugu at home so your child grows up truly bilingual.", "NTA! \n\nI have an MA in Second Language Acquisition. Bilingual environments are incredibly beneficial for kids in the long-run. Also, she's *four*.....**of course** she's gonna have difficulty with phonics. Phonics in particular is a matter of exercising the muscles in your mouth, it's way more physical than people realize. For example, Chinese speakers don't usually use the back muscles of their mouthes, so when they're older they have an accent that is the result of front muscles being stronger and back muscles being weaker. Sometimes accent coaches will have them put wine corks in their mouth while reading because it forces them to exercise the muscles in the back rather than rely on the ones in the front, sort of like how people with a lazy eye will put an eye patch on their good eye. It forces them to exercise the weaker one. Your daughter just hasn't used the parts of her mouth needed for certain English sounds enough, but she will because she's speaking English everyday.\n\n\nPart of learning a language, any language, is struggling through different parts of it. You and your wife probably had difficulty with certain parts of Telugu when you were toddlers too. And I'm 100% positive that if you were to go into your daughters preschool class you'd find plenty of kids with speech impediments, incorrect grammar, and other communication issues. It's totally normal!\n\n\nBut! Depriving your daughter of the opportunity to grow up bilingual would be far more detrimental. Many studies show that people who speak 2+ languages excel in academia at a higher level than those who don't. It's like exercise for the brain that not everyone has access to. Not only that, but you'll be maintaining a connection to her culture. That's important!\n\n\n\nShe's growing up in the US. Her English will inevitably surpass her Telugu and no one will remember that she ever had issues with phonics. But later on if she can't speak Telugu, both you and your wife will regret not teaching her sooner. Bilingualism should be treasured and nurtured.", "NAH.

No, you do not have \"great English\" if you think that is a correct statement.", "NTA. But this may hinder your child's speech development which may later impact her learning if she is growing up in a English schooling system.

This is something you could bring up with your wife, her speaking English and you Telugu. \n\nI would also suggest looking up some on the studies on bi-lingual toddlers to show your wife and the preschool teacher.
