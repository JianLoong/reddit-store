We are both software engineers and we have a daughter, Jia(4F). She is our adopted daughter, we adopted her at age 1.5 after finding out that my wife is infertile and likely won't be able to have the children for the rest of her life, which was a very crushing blow for me, and her too.\n\nAnyways, at home, I speak Telugu. After a long day's worth of work the last thing I want to do is to speak more English, and my daughter is picking it up good. \n\nThe issue is that we are talking to her preschool teacher during one of those parent teacher meeting they do here, and the teacher told us that Jia is having trouble with phonics. I explained that my wife is handling the phonics flash cards, but the teacher said that that is not enough actually and she was asking about languages what we speak at home, I explained that we just speak Telugu, so then the teacher recommended us to speak more English around Jia.\n\nWhen we got home, my wife started only addressing me in English and would ignore me unless I spoke back. This frankly really ticked and pissed me off because as you can see very clearly in the post in which I am writing, I have great English, so I told my wife that I'll talk sometimes to Jia in English until we fix it, but my wife will say that it is the matter that we have to get used to speaking more English in home so it will come more naturally. It's been a week now, and I'm feeling kind of depressed because all I hear is English, and it's harder to make jokes and have more casual conversations, it honestly feels like I'm back in work. I know you don't attach emotion to a language but the sound and tones really bring me back to work so I told my wife, however she is saying that this will pass and that I need to be a team player in the team together working as one.\n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1701834660, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18bv4jz/aita_for_refusing_on_budging_on_speaking_only/", "score": 18, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I\u2019m not a linguistic expert, but what if you speak in your native language and your wife responds in English? If you can afford it, get your daughter a speech therapist. Growing up bilingual is an awesome opportunity for her and could open many doors in her future.", "NTA. There\u2019s a very simple and easy solution/ compromise that many bilingual families employ for their young children. Your wife speaks to your child only in English and you speak to them only in Telugu. When your wife speaks to you she uses English and you respond in Telugu. That way you both get a little of what you want and more importantly, you BOTH foster your daughter\u2019s vocabulary and pattern recognition. Now that\u2019s teamwork. \n\nThere will be a learning curve where your daughter may mix the two languages together in sentences, but all you have to do is gently remind them to stick to one language when speaking. Also set the rule that she speaks English at school so she can show off how awesome her second language is as a surprise talent! The added benefit to this practice is that she can learn so many words in both languages as you and your wife speak to each other as essentially you two will BOTH act as real time translations. Children are sponges. No doubt she\u2019ll progress wonderfully if you choose to implement a 1 parent 1 language policy.\n\nAlso, not for nothing but it\u2019s kind of a shit move for your wife to ignore you when not speaking English, it\u2019s practically punishment for/ shaming the skill of being bilingual. Your daughter is going to pick up on that behaviour and may have unintended consequences unrelated to the language issue. She\u2019s going to see mom ignore dad. And that is the bigger issue (and also AH behaviour).", "NTA. \n\nPlease continue to speak Telugu at home. Your daughter is surrounded in an English speaking world. She will adapt. If she's only just speaking English now, then yes, it's to he expected she has some difficulties. Perhaps, as others have noted, a few sessions with a speech language pathologist wouldn't hurt. Heck, English is hard for some adults when it is their only language!", "NTA\n\nYour preschool teacher knows nothing about handling bilingual children and is giving bad advice. Find yourself some resources on best practices, because if you stop speaking Telugu at home now, your kid will never speak it fluently.", "NTA kids have very versatile brain and they can pickup different languages . Teacher was wrong to say only speak English with your child. My daughter speaks Tamil / Hindi at home , English /French at school . Don\u2019t listen to school teacher , your child is only 4 years old not 19 years old.", "NTA. She is likely only in preschool not even kindergarten she has barely spent time around that many English speakers. The more immersion she gets at school the better her English will get.\n\nIf she\u2019s in preschool it probably means you\u2019re paying money for that preschool and now they\u2019re telling you how to parent? I would have a big problem with that. Feels like they are passing the buck to an extent. Shes 4. Have they even tried for very long to work on phonetics?\n\nConsider the story I am about to write below when you decide to stop speaking Telugu at home:\n\nA close childhood friend of mine is Italian on his fathers side.  His grandmother came to America as an adult and learned English here. She never bothered to teach any of her 3 sons how to speak Italian. When she got older she developed some pretty severe dementia and remarkably one of the first things she forgot was how to speak English. Her family could not communicate with her in her final days without a translator present. Private moments and private conversations all had to be witnessed by this translator who they obviously also had to pay.  These men couldn\u2019t speak to their own mother. \n\nI only speak English but if I get married to someone with a different mother tongue I will very strongly encourage them to speak in their native tongue for this reason. Nobody deserves to not be able to communicate with their own parents in their final days.\n\nFood for thought.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA. Your daughter will learn English just fine, and being fluent in two or more languages will be hugely beneficial for her. The preschool teacher needs to learn about how bilingual language learning works. Keep speaking to her in Telugu.", "NAH\n\nYou absolutely attach emotion to language. Further, as someone who has taught English, it generally isn't necessary to speak English at home for a child to pick it up quite easily. If you're daughter is having a little trouble, speaking to her in English should be more than enough create a better foundation for her. Children, especially before the age of 5, are like sponges when it comes to language.\n\nAlso, other than minor errors, your English is quite good. Your wife choosing to speak to you in English when your daughter is with you would be one thing, but doing it all the time is another. You absolutely should focus on speaking English with her if needed, but don't just take the word of one teacher. Get her evaluated. US teachers often have a bias for English that has nothing to do with the child's education.", ">(1) not wanting to speak English at home \n\nIf your wife speaks Telugu and your daughter too, NTA.\n\n>(2) I might be in wrong because Jia needs it and it seems like my wife and the teacher gets worried if Jia continues not progressing and maybe this will make it go faster if there is that sense of immersion in the household\n\nI'm bilingual. French and English. But I'm only bilingual in English because I was raised, for the first six years of my life, in a mostly English environment. Both my parents spoke French, they only ever used French with us, our mother going as far as only answering when we'd speak French to her, I went to school in French only and, yet, here I am, with my very decent English.\n\nThis is all to say that, no, unless Jia has issues even in Telugu, she does not need her environment to be entirely in English to master English pronunciation (phonics, I hate that word with a passion). She'll get there easily as she will be in a mostly English environment. I might get slightly faster but, frankly, at the huge expense of not being able to interact with her extended Telugu relatives among other things.", "Oh no. No, don't only speak English at home! One of the most wonderful things is to be able to speak a second language. Don't deprive your daughter of that!\n\nNTA.", "NAH. You want to speak your native language and there is nothing wrong with that. However, it is creating problems with your child who needs to learn to speak English fluently. The best option is to speak both English and Telugu at home so your child grows up truly bilingual.", "NTA! \n\nI have an MA in Second Language Acquisition. Bilingual environments are incredibly beneficial for kids in the long-run. Also, she's *four*.....**of course** she's gonna have difficulty with phonics. Phonics in particular is a matter of exercising the muscles in your mouth, it's way more physical than people realize. For example, Chinese speakers don't usually use the back muscles of their mouthes, so when they're older they have an accent that is the result of front muscles being stronger and back muscles being weaker. Sometimes accent coaches will have them put wine corks in their mouth while reading because it forces them to exercise the muscles in the back rather than rely on the ones in the front, sort of like how people with a lazy eye will put an eye patch on their good eye. It forces them to exercise the weaker one. Your daughter just hasn't used the parts of her mouth needed for certain English sounds enough, but she will because she's speaking English everyday.\n\n\nPart of learning a language, any language, is struggling through different parts of it. You and your wife probably had difficulty with certain parts of Telugu when you were toddlers too. And I'm 100% positive that if you were to go into your daughters preschool class you'd find plenty of kids with speech impediments, incorrect grammar, and other communication issues. It's totally normal!\n\n\nBut! Depriving your daughter of the opportunity to grow up bilingual would be far more detrimental. Many studies show that people who speak 2+ languages excel in academia at a higher level than those who don't. It's like exercise for the brain that not everyone has access to. Not only that, but you'll be maintaining a connection to her culture. That's important!\n\n\n\nShe's growing up in the US. Her English will inevitably surpass her Telugu and no one will remember that she ever had issues with phonics. But later on if she can't speak Telugu, both you and your wife will regret not teaching her sooner. Bilingualism should be treasured and nurtured.", "NAH. I think a bilingual home is ideal, but if your child is raised in a place where there is a dominant language she is struggling with, it is incumbent for you to foster their development in that language.", "YTA your daughter is important and you are acting like she is an inconvenience.", "Split between NAH and ESH. For refusing to budge and not looking for compromise for the sake of your daughter and the household. For your wife to make a unilateral and passive aggressive decision to go English only without discussion.", "If your child is struggling it should be obvious that you should be speaking English. My grandson is a little over a year old and his mother will hold a piece of fruit and say what it is in English and in Spanish. This way he will be bilingual. I would suggest speaking both languages but until they get their phonics straight speak more english", "YTA holy shit do you care about your child at this age they can handle both. No, you do not have \"great English\" if you think that is a correct statement.", "NTA. But this may hinder your child's speech development which may later impact her learning if she is growing up in a English schooling system. She may fall behind her peers and it may be difficult for her to catch up. Also, her caregivers at school may find providing care difficult if they cannot understand you child. \n\nI do agree however that you show pursue both languages.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It is also known that young children that are bi-lingual will switch between languages and that doing so does not stunt any learning but can have many educational benefits. \n\nI have heard that in a lot of bi-lingual families, each parent will speak a different language so that children are used to both. This is something you could bring up with your wife, her speaking English and you Telugu. \n\nI would also suggest looking up some on the studies on bi-lingual toddlers to show your wife and the preschool teacher. Not to mention, that not allowing your daughter to learn your native language when she is also adopted could foster feelings of exclusion as she gets older which could put a negative strain on your relationship. It would also cause her to have trouble growing relationships with any family that only speak Telugu.", "NTA.  A multi-lingual child.  Is more valuable.  Than early phonics.  If your child is multi-lingual.  They will learn more languages easier.  They will have a leg up on others.", "The teacher and your wife are wrong. Kids will learn continue to speak your language to the kid.", "your preschool teacher is not right. Children can learn two languages with no trouble at all, and there is some other issue here. \n\n (European person speaking)", "Most preschool teachers have 24 semester units in early childcare (about two quarters of classes). Elementary teachers have a four year university degree and a two year credentialing degree. The preschool teacher probably doesn't have the background that would allow her to give you valid advice about bilingualism or second language development.\n\nKeep encouraging your daughter to be bilingual. Bilingualism grants numerous benefits to the brain. Children who are bilingual are quicker to develop higher order thinking skills such as problem-solving and task-switching. They also tend to have a superior working memory. Additionally, there's evidence that bilingualism can delay the onset of dementia. Keep talking to your kid in Telugu. It's good for her.", "All these people talking about bilingual children and how brains work seem to have forgotten that this child was not a newborn.\n\nThis little girl was a year and a half old when she was adopted.  She has enough to deal with and not speaking to her in her own language is cruel.  \n\nChildren's brains are amazing, but this child's brain is dealing with losing her birth parents, and possibly a foster carer as well and having an entirely new set of parents.", "NTA. The preschool teacher doesn\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about. Your kid\u2019s English may be delayed, but they\u2019re learning two languages at once. You\u2019re actually putting your kid at an advantage long term by doing this.", "NTA. Can you try coming up with a compromise? See if the two of you can settle on a number of days a week you speak only English at home in front of your daughter. \n\nThis is something I recommend to my ELL students who are struggling with language skills. Their families will pick 1 or 2 days a week where they only speak English. \n\nI have also had families who are concerned that their children are losing their native language. I always recommend they pick a day or 2 where they only speak their native language. \n\nThis gets the entire house involved and shows the children that both languages are important to the entire house. Best of luck!", "We have friends who are a wife that teaches Spanish and she often speaks it with her kids, her husband is Samoan and speaks that to the kids, and I believe there\u2019s also an additional language that they both mutually speak in addition to English. It is fascinating to watch their kids switch back and forth completely seamlessly from the time they\u2019re two.", "Many studies show that despite starting slow bilingual speakers tend to eventually surpass their peers, not only in the target language but in other subjects as well. And that even applies to kids who have never spoken a word of the dominant classroom language being thrown into the environment. It could be a 5 year old's first day in China and regardless of their first language, they will eventually surpass their peers. \n\n\nPeople all over the world often have misconceptions about language acquisition.", "Great to know things have changed since I was at school! Bilingual kids were often left behind - that's probably more to do with the teacher I guess. \n\nI think the idea of speaking both to their child is a really good, I don't think enough people appreciate the skill it is to master two languages.", "It's often not because of the language environment that they get left behind but more because of the school system, classroom environment, peer pressure, or family issues that effect their academic performance. When controlled for those things though, the language aspect actually proves to be more of a boon rather than a hindrance."]}
