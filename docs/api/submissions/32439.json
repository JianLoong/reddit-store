Growing up bilingual is an awesome opportunity for her and could open many doors in her future.", "NTA. There\u2019s a very simple and easy solution/ compromise that many bilingual families employ for their young children. Your wife speaks to your child only in English and you speak to them only in Telugu. When your wife speaks to you she uses English and you respond in Telugu. That way you both get a little of what you want and more importantly, you BOTH foster your daughter\u2019s vocabulary and pattern recognition. Now that\u2019s teamwork. \n\nThere will be a learning curve where your daughter may mix the two languages together in sentences, but all you have to do is gently remind them to stick to one language when speaking. Also set the rule that she speaks English at school so she can show off how awesome her second language is as a surprise talent! The added benefit to this practice is that she can learn so many words in both languages as you and your wife speak to each other as essentially you two will BOTH act as real time translations. Children are sponges. No doubt she\u2019ll progress wonderfully if you choose to implement a 1 parent 1 language policy.\n\nAlso, not for nothing but it\u2019s kind of a shit move for your wife to ignore you when not speaking English, it\u2019s practically punishment for/ shaming the skill of being bilingual. Your daughter is going to pick up on that behaviour and may have unintended consequences unrelated to the language issue. She\u2019s going to see mom ignore dad. And that is the bigger issue (and also AH behaviour).", "NTA. \n\nPlease continue to speak Telugu at home. Your daughter is surrounded in an English speaking world. She will adapt. If she's only just speaking English now, then yes, it's to he expected she has some difficulties. Perhaps, as others have noted, a few sessions with a speech language pathologist wouldn't hurt. Heck, English is hard for some adults when it is their only language!", "NTA\n\nYour preschool teacher knows nothing about handling bilingual children and is giving bad advice. Find yourself some resources on best practices, because if you stop speaking Telugu at home now, your kid will never speak it fluently.", "NTA kids have very versatile brain and they can pickup different languages . Teacher was wrong to say only speak English with your child. My daughter speaks Tamil / Hindi at home , English /French at school .

She is likely only in preschool not even kindergarten she has barely spent time around that many English speakers. The more immersion she gets at school the better her English will get.\n\nIf she\u2019s in preschool it probably means you\u2019re paying money for that preschool and now they\u2019re telling you how to parent? I would have a big problem with that. Feels like they are passing the buck to an extent. Shes 4. Have they even tried for very long to work on phonetics?\n\nConsider the story I am about to write below when you decide to stop speaking Telugu at home:\n\nA close childhood friend of mine is Italian on his fathers side.  His grandmother came to America as an adult and learned English here. She never bothered to teach any of her 3 sons how to speak Italian. When she got older she developed some pretty severe dementia and remarkably one of the first things she forgot was how to speak English. Her family could not communicate with her in her final days without a translator present. Private moments and private conversations all had to be witnessed by this translator who they obviously also had to pay.  These men couldn\u2019t speak to their own mother. \n\nI only speak English but if I get married to someone with a different mother tongue I will very strongly encourage them to speak in their native tongue for this reason. Nobody deserves to not be able to communicate with their own parents in their final days.\n\nFood for thought.\n\nEdit: spelling", "NTA. Your daughter will learn English just fine, and being fluent in two or more languages will be hugely beneficial for her. The preschool teacher needs to learn about how bilingual language learning works. Keep speaking to her in Telugu.", "NAH\n\nYou absolutely attach emotion to language. Further, as someone who has taught English, it generally isn't necessary to speak English at home for a child to pick it up quite easily. If you're daughter is having a little trouble, speaking to her in English should be more than enough create a better foundation for her. Children, especially before the age of 5, are like sponges when it comes to language.\n\nAlso, other than minor errors, your English is quite good. Your wife choosing to speak to you in English when your daughter is with you would be one thing, but doing it all the time is another. You absolutely should focus on speaking English with her if needed, but don't just take the word of one teacher. Get her evaluated. US teachers often have a bias for English that has nothing to do with the child's education.", ">(1) not wanting to speak English at home \n\nIf your wife speaks Telugu and your daughter too, NTA.\n\n>(2) I might be in wrong because Jia needs it and it seems like my wife and the teacher gets worried if Jia continues not progressing and maybe this will make it go faster if there is that sense of immersion in the household\n\nI'm bilingual. French and English. But I'm only bilingual in English because I was raised, for the first six years of my life, in a mostly English environment. Both my parents spoke French, they only ever used French with us, our mother going as far as only answering when we'd speak French to her, I went to school in French only and, yet, here I am, with my very decent English.\n\nThis is all to say that, no, unless Jia has issues even in Telugu, she does not need her environment to be entirely in English to master English pronunciation (phonics, I hate that word with a passion). She'll get there easily as she will be in a mostly English environment. I might get slightly faster but, frankly, at the huge expense of not being able to interact with her extended Telugu relatives among other things.", "Oh no. No, don't only speak English at home! One of the most wonderful things is to be able to speak a second language. Don't deprive your daughter of that!\n\nNTA.", "NAH. You want to speak your native language and there is nothing wrong with that. However, it is creating problems with your child who needs to learn to speak English fluently. The best option is to speak both English and Telugu at home so your child grows up truly bilingual.", "NTA! \n\nI have an MA in Second Language Acquisition. Bilingual environments are incredibly beneficial for kids in the long-run. Also, she's *four*.....**of course** she's gonna have difficulty with phonics. Phonics in particular is a matter of exercising the muscles in your mouth, it's way more physical than people realize. For example, Chinese speakers don't usually use the back muscles of their mouthes, so when they're older they have an accent that is the result of front muscles being stronger and back muscles being weaker. Sometimes accent coaches will have them put wine corks in their mouth while reading because it forces them to exercise the muscles in the back rather than rely on the ones in the front, sort of like how people with a lazy eye will put an eye patch on their good eye. It forces them to exercise the weaker one. Your daughter just hasn't used the parts of her mouth needed for certain English sounds enough, but she will because she's speaking English everyday.\n\n\nPart of learning a language, any language, is struggling through different parts of it. You and your wife probably had difficulty with certain parts of Telugu when you were toddlers too. And I'm 100% positive that if you were to go into your daughters preschool class you'd find plenty of kids with speech impediments, incorrect grammar, and other communication issues. It's totally normal!\n\n\nBut! Depriving your daughter of the opportunity to grow up bilingual would be far more detrimental. Many studies show that people who speak 2+ languages excel in academia at a higher level than those who don't. It's like exercise for the brain that not everyone has access to. Not only that, but you'll be maintaining a connection to her culture. That's important!\n\n\n\nShe's growing up in the US. Her English will inevitably surpass her Telugu and no one will remember that she ever had issues with phonics. But later on if she can't speak Telugu, both you and your wife will regret not teaching her sooner. Bilingualism should be treasured and nurtured.", "NAH.

No, you do not have \"great English\" if you think that is a correct statement.", "NTA. But this may hinder your child's speech development which may later impact her learning if she is growing up in a English schooling system.

This is something you could bring up with your wife, her speaking English and you Telugu. \n\nI would also suggest looking up some on the studies on bi-lingual toddlers to show your wife and the preschool teacher.

But on average they outperform their peers later in their educational journey.\n\nDefinitely don't let the teacher's reaction stop you.\n\nDo look into other pre literacy skills you can reinforce at home -- rhyming, reading books to her, breaking words into their sounds (eg: we're going to the shops to go sh-opp-ing) and rephrase her words back to her with correct grammar (\"Daddy go car\" to \"yes, Daddy's going to drive the car\"). Do this in both languages.\n\nDo push for more support if there is a delay. It's easiest to fix delays in pre literacy skills early. That support shouldn't be taking away her first language.", "Exactly, that preschool teacher is an idiot. She obviously didn\u2019t listen very well to the language development part of her degree. This is the t8me to be teaching your child all the languages you know.", "Also why in holy hell is there a benchmark for kids learning phonics in preschool that your child is not meeting? Many kids brains simply are not ready for reading at that age. The preschool sounds like one of those \"my kid is being groomed for the Ivies since age 2\" hellscapes that you should run from. Let your preschooler be a preschooler for God sakes... she won't be that young for long.", "I second this. I didn't start learning English until I was 5 (refugee to Canada). I was speaking English quite well by 6, but they still placed me in an ESL program because of my background. My parents only spoke our native language at home. By grade 5, I was placed in the gifted English program. I'm a lawyer now and I'm still fluent in my native language. \n\nMy brother, who is 3 years younger than me, only spoke English at home, because his teachers said he was a bit delayed in his English skills. Long story short, he can barely speak our native language and his English is also awful.\n\nMake sure your child reads a lot. That's how I learned and improved my English skills.", "Great response!", "This is important - same thing with my grandmother. Thankfully her children could speak with her but all her grandchildren only speak English. I really missed her conversation in her last year\u2026.she was very funny and I needed someone else to translate in our last conversation, and having someone else involved made the conversation stilted and confusing for both of us. I wished I knew her language.", "I'm bilingual and this does not work.  If you ask me a question in one language, I'll answer in that language. It's like I'm in a different gear. The other day someone asked me in English whether my native language had a term for \"blanking on a word\" and I just... blanked on the word. \nMost families who raise bilingual children have a family language, plus one or both parents speak a different language when alone with the child.", "The child is attending English-language schooling. She'll grow up truly bilingual even if neither parent ever speaks English to her.", "> But the real issue here is that your kid is growing up in America and having trouble with English. You can still teach her Telugu. But English should be the priority here. It is how she is going to be able to interact with the world around her. At school, with friends, then later at work.\n\nThe child attends English-language school five days a week. She does not need to hear English at home as well. It truly is unnecessary.", "OPOL is a validated method for raising bilingual children.", "Evidently the kid is still having issues learning English according to the OP.", "At age 4 even English speaking children dont have all their phonetic sounds for various reasons"]}
