Either it was a very very very big deal of an argument or she's very vindictive.\n\nYou on the other hand did what was needed to make your son feel special on his birthday, andi think asking his best friend for advice was very thoughtful.\n\nYour wife is more concerned about being upstaged by you than the fact that, had you not organised all this, your son would have had no birthday celebration and gifts.\n\nCan't imagine being that self-centred and vindictive to be honest.\n\nNTA\n\nEdit to correct mistaken understanding, thought the argument was you and your wife, not your wife and son.", "NTA. Your wife seems very insecure... and also an hypocrite. She fought with your son, you made sure your son had a nice birthday, and she's... feeling bad because you made sure your son had a nice birthday? Also, making the day of your SON's birthday about her? Seriously? You're not the one who needs to apologize.", "NTA! I do wonder what the argument was about and if it really had no influence on this situation. But your wife being angry at you for in short planning a better birthday for your son than she would have is just petty. And in general, i\u2018m always a bit disappointed in parents who are unhappy if something good happens to their kids. Sure your wife and your son are in a stroop atm, but he had a great birthday and you did a good job as a dad, how can this be something bad? Frankly her sons birthday is not about *her*", "NTA\n\nConsequences for behaviour is one thing, intentionally cancelling everything to do with your child's birthday and refusing to even spend time with them on the day is incredibly toxic parenting. Your wife is being an AH here.", "OP you are fine. Your wife's behaviour is odd and she seems extremely angry and upset by something deeper than this. If you wanna figure it out you should try having a conversation about why. Possibly consider therapy(not a cure-all, but it's the best option)\n\nHer reasoning as to why is not a justification, and what she did was wrong. You did everything you could for your son's birthday and I hope your son had a great time.\n\n\nAs for the not knowing what he likes makes sense. I was the same as a teenage boy. Loved my father and did a lot with him, but I didn't really ever talk about personal preferences or my own shit. Just life and whatever else. Anyone saying he's an AH for not knowing the type of cake his son likes isnt exactly realizing the amount of autonomy teens can have after 13/14. Kids change a lot in a few short years. \n\n\n\nNTA. You seem to be doing great as a father and please keep it up by treating your kids to what they want.", "NTA at all!

Your wife is responding in quite an immature fashion, and totally disregarding that her sons birthday is not about her, it's about him. Perhaps if she wasn't so busy pouting she could have simply enjoyed the day, and bonded with her son. She clearly thinks her son prefers you over her, but that doesn't mean you should step back. She should step up, and stop with the petty fights.", "NTA your wife didn\u2019t want to plan it, you did. Is she going through the menopause? That might explain the mood changes, which is understandable. My mum was a nightmare with the mood swings.", "NTA.  Your wife has issues that go beyond this incident.  I would tell her she is acting unreasonably and it is affecting her relationships within the family. She should talk to a therapist and you should too. You sound weary of her behavior which is not how a mature adult should conduct herself.  Don't just say, oh well, that's how she is.

Your wife is a huge AH. This party isn't about her. If she was still angry about the earbuds, she should have had a private conversation with you.", "NTA, your son still deserves to feel appreciated by his parents. She should be able to put a petty argument aside for his birthday. Also, she excluded herself by not participating or eating with you guys. It's HIS birthday, why does anybody paying attention to her matter if she wants to go off sulking? You did a great job planning something special for him.  What a good dad!", "Sounds like your wife needs to step up in the parenting leagues. You did a fantastic job for his birthday, reaching out to his friend to learn more about his interest.

She had plenty of time to join the party planning", "Definitely not cancelling-birthday worthy.", "So, your wife is accusing your son of being a thief because she can't keep track of her own property. Then, when shown proof that he is not a thief, she decides to discount that and is continuing to do so. In order to punish the crime that only she and the voices in her head believe your son committed, she decided he doesn't get to have anything for his birthday. She is now in a snit because you made his birthday special when she wanted it to be as miserable as she is. Did I miss anything? \n\nYour wife is an AH. She told you why she's really being like this: she thought everything would be about her. If your son didn't have his celebration, everyone would have asked why, and she could then air her grievances and get some sympathy. Instead, you gave him an awesome birthday, and even when she sulked in her bedroom like a moody child, no one bothered with her. The birthday was shockingly about your son, and not about Mrs. \"I won't admit I'm wrong and want everything to be about me.\"\n\nSo I have to ask: does she do this often? You say she's unreasonable, but this is a step far beyond that. Your son proved his innocence, and she still wanted to punish him. She was determined that his birthday be ignored, that he be left feeling hurt and unvalued, because she cannot admit she's wrong and she will not admit that she's to blame for losing her air pods. She's now angry that you didn't play along, aggrieved no one was begging her sulky self to come downstairs or grovelling for forgiveness, and is royally miffed that she rightfully looks bloody awful for not making any effort for her own child's birthday. She's trying to push her guilt onto you; in her mind, the problem isn't  that she's being unreasonable and awful, it's that you showed her up. Your wife needs serious help if this is her normal way of operating.\n\nShe's manipulating you into apologising for something that doesn't warrant an apology by making you feel bad. Instead of accepting the apology, she kept trying to hammer the point home that you're wrong because if she paused in her monologue for even a second, you might realise that she's being selfish and awful. She was being manipulative by sulking in her bedroom because she thought the silent treatment would make you or your son go grovel to get her downstairs. She's refusing to admit she's wrong and is determined to hurt your son to prove a point. What point? That when mum is irresponsible enough to lose her stuff, one of the kids must admit to being a thief or else. \n\nNTA, although perhaps invite Alice for a film night or something to say thanks. As others said, she should really have been invited to the birthday thing, but a film night will do, especially if you make sure to get her favourite snacks/food.", "I was wondering what was the fight between mother and son about and if maybe, it was also the mother's birthday and that's why she was so hurt about everything.", "i know i should probably be more involved but its just how me and my son are. neither of us are talkers and we consider a evening watching cartoons sat next to each other without talking binding time. i definitely see how this comes across.   \n\n\nalso no my wifes birthday isnt near my sons and i do put effort into her birthday aswell.", "Redditors jump to conclusions challenge(very fucking possible)", "Because she has anger and control issues", "Good call. Maybe OP doesn\u2019t put effort into moms birthday.", "Let's all find crazy excuses with no justification to blame the man. Of course the woman couldn't possibly be an ah"]}
