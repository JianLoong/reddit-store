Then, when shown proof that he is not a thief, she decides to discount that and is continuing to do so. In order to punish the crime that only she and the voices in her head believe your son committed, she decided he doesn't get to have anything for his birthday. She is now in a snit because you made his birthday special when she wanted it to be as miserable as she is. Did I miss anything? \n\nYour wife is an AH. She told you why she's really being like this: she thought everything would be about her. If your son didn't have his celebration, everyone would have asked why, and she could then air her grievances and get some sympathy. Instead, you gave him an awesome birthday, and even when she sulked in her bedroom like a moody child, no one bothered with her. The birthday was shockingly about your son, and not about Mrs. \"I won't admit I'm wrong and want everything to be about me.\"\n\nSo I have to ask: does she do this often? You say she's unreasonable, but this is a step far beyond that. Your son proved his innocence, and she still wanted to punish him. She was determined that his birthday be ignored, that he be left feeling hurt and unvalued, because she cannot admit she's wrong and she will not admit that she's to blame for losing her air pods. She's now angry that you didn't play along, aggrieved no one was begging her sulky self to come downstairs or grovelling for forgiveness, and is royally miffed that she rightfully looks bloody awful for not making any effort for her own child's birthday. She's trying to push her guilt onto you; in her mind, the problem isn't  that she's being unreasonable and awful, it's that you showed her up. Your wife needs serious help if this is her normal way of operating.\n\nShe's manipulating you into apologising for something that doesn't warrant an apology by making you feel bad. Instead of accepting the apology, she kept trying to hammer the point home that you're wrong because if she paused in her monologue for even a second, you might realise that she's being selfish and awful. She was being manipulative by sulking in her bedroom because she thought the silent treatment would make you or your son go grovel to get her downstairs. She's refusing to admit she's wrong and is determined to hurt your son to prove a point. What point? That when mum is irresponsible enough to lose her stuff, one of the kids must admit to being a thief or else. \n\nNTA, although perhaps invite Alice for a film night or something to say thanks. As others said, she should really have been invited to the birthday thing, but a film night will do, especially if you make sure to get her favourite snacks/food.", "I was wondering what was the fight between mother and son about and if maybe, it was also the mother's birthday and that's why she was so hurt about everything.", "i know i should probably be more involved but its just how me and my son are. neither of us are talkers and we consider a evening watching cartoons sat next to each other without talking binding time. i definitely see how this comes across.   \n\n\nalso no my wifes birthday isnt near my sons and i do put effort into her birthday aswell.", "Aita redditors jump to conclusions challenge(very fucking possible)", "Because she has anger and control issues", "Good call.

You acknowledge your wife started a petty argument with her child and refused to acknowledge his birthday as punishment (*but still helped herself to his bday cake*)?

It's appalling your family is so centred around your wife neither of you know your children very well.
