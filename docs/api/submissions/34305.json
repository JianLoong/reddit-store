She's the one who crossed a line, not you. Taking a break until the end of December is entirely justified given the breach of trust. If she can't grasp why you're hurt, that's on her. You're not obligated to celebrate her birthday when you're still grappling with the aftermath of what you consider cheating. Your feelings and emotional well-being take precedence. If she thinks it's stupid, that's her problem.", "NTA.\nHas she even apologized? You seemed to have clearly stated your feelings on this issue,  and it seems like she has as well, yet she remains unremorseful about her actions. \nIt feels with what you've said that she is insecure as well.  She may just not be ready for a relationship if she continues to inform you of her sexual desires for women while being with you.  \nIf she never apologized and just expected you to be there for her birthday without making steps towards reconciling, then she has no room to be upset with you. \nHonestly man if her attitude hasn't changed it might be time to call this before things get worse for your mental health.", "Not the asshole. \n\n\nShe kissed someone, when she's with you. Drunk or not, it's cheating. If the tables were turned with you in the same situation as her, she would be calling you a cheater, and so would many people on here. \n\n\nIf she can't understand what she did was cheating, then she doesn't deserve you. \n\n\nYou deserve someone who respects and understands your insecurities and shares the same views as you on what is cheating and what isn't.", "NTA. Your girlfriend kissed someone else in front of you. That's cheating and is totally fucked up.", "NTA - but if you\u2019re going to break up with her, then break up with her. Because if you keep her hanging on, for whatever purpose, that would make you an AH. \n\nThe notion of \u2018a break\u2019 is, frankly, utter bs. Either you are together or you are not. So just make the decision and then move on accordingly.", "NTA. She cheated. Then she gaslit you, telling you your supposed insecurity is to blame for your rightful reaction to her cheating. She's lucky you didn't break up for good (which, honestly, you should do), much less go pamper her on her birthday.", "Mate this relationship is going nowhere. You're both messed up.", "1) What she did was cheating. Kiss on the lips in quite intimate even if it was short kiss. So your insecurity and feelings of being hurt are completely valid OP.  \n\n\n2) She is projecting hard on you. She knows she did it/would do it so she thinks you are in the same way. It's really toxic mindset and it will get worse in time OP. I've been through similar relationship where my ex was mad at me everytime I went out with my friends or I even texted with my female friends because she thought I was flirting with other women or I was cheating on her, when I am loyal in relationships, but in the end it was her who was flirting with other guys and even cheated on me - She confessed after break up in hopes of hurting me.  \n\n\nYou are on the break and if that means you are not ready or you don't want to see her yet then it's ok if you skip her birthday. In the end she is cause of all of this drama. Being BI-curious is not excuse for cheating out in the open while you were sitting there.  \n\n\nNTA OP for not wanting to see her but you kinda TA for staying in this toxic relationship.", "Y'all are exhausting. That you are not in my orbit is one of my blessings I will be counting today. I would advise any of *my* friends in this situation to just rip off the band-aid and break up, but it honestly sounds like you deserve each other. My assumption after reading this is that you are both still in high school. If you are adults, I would strongly advise taking some time to work on yourselves and learn about healthy communication, setting clear boundaries and how to treat people you care about. If I had to describe the relationship you have presented here in one word, I'm gonna go for 'toxic'. If I were given two words is would be 'drama queens'. \n\nESH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

This is a \"sympathy peck on the lips\" to a friend, in your presence. I can't understand why you feel threatened by it and call it cheating. It was a mutual friend who was sad. You could have got up and asked if she wanted you to kiss her next.", "[deleted]", "NTA. weighing in as someone who is polyamorous and in an open relationship: even if you and her were in an open relationship, this would be cheating unless she had communicated with you that it was ok beforehand. cheating is about a breach of trust. her sexuality has little to do with it, i can see why it would make you more insecure but even if she was straight this would be an issue because she did not ask you before kissing this friend. i\u2019ve kissed my friends platonically with my boyfriend around before and i always made a point to ask if he was ok with it *beforehand* and it was only after obtaining his consent that i would do it. you are also well within your rights to want space during a break from a relationship, regardless of if the other person\u2019s birthday occurs during the break. if you do pick up where you left off you can celebrate it with her later. but if i were you i would not pick up where you left off unless she fully admits she was in the wrong and apologises. even then, this isn\u2019t something to just be brushed off, so an apology alone might not be enough.", "YTA. A 1 second drunk kiss in public does not mean she is cheating. It was inappropriate, and maybe silly, but it's not cheating. If there's more going on, then maybe, but this one incident, no. So it's your insecurity, and you need to get that sorted. You could lose her, you may already have lost her because you can't cope with her being who she is, and a single 1 second kiss. You knew that separating till the end of the month would include her birthday, and new years eve. These are party moments, where she would have wanted to be with you. YTA OP, and it may cost you her love.", "[deleted]", "Info-Did she agree the break and the timing of the break (until the end of December) was a good idea when the idea of it was thrown out?", "&#x200B;\n\nNTA.

Which I would never.\n\nIn my experience, a big part of the people that are scared of their partner cheating, are scared because they themselves are cheaters or could imagine cheating themselves. Yes, this is a generalization and there are other reasons to be afraid of this (for example, experiences in the past or general lack of trust because of other life events). But still, most people I know that are afraid their partner would cheat, have cheated themselves somewhere in their lives.\n\nIf I were you, I would seriously reconsider this relationship.", "NTA. I had an ex who normalized this type of behavior and I should never have let myself be used like that.\n\nBy normalize I mean full on making out with another woman and just expecting me to be okay with it. Sadly I was stupid enough to think it was.", "Coming from a bisexual female married to a man, what she did is WRONG. \n\nI feel a lot of disrespect just given the paragraph to read and it doesn't sound new. \n\nTake a long, hard look at this relationship op, and really see what you want in life.

It's a fairytale.", "Totally agree!  She kissed another woman with a quick peck on the lips.  It's not as if she massively pashed some guy out of nowhere.  Seems like Op was looking for some reason, any reason, to break up the relationship, but using this as the excuse is pathetic.  OP is the TA.", "\u2018The context was not sexual\u2019? So then it\u2019s not cheating? Mind-boggling stuff. Would you say that if she kissed a guy after a guy sad \u2018I\u2019m sad I don\u2019t have anyone to kiss\u2019. People tend to excuse cheating a lot when a girl cheats with another gil but its the same thing. \n\nShe is BISEXUAL. How is the context then not sexual. She cheated in front of him. Disrespected him after he had already expressed his insecurities.", "Ikr?? Its wild that people nowadays don't understand non-sexual stuff and sarcasm. My ex gf dumped me because I once put my D into her friends mouth non-sexually because her friend was curious how D tastes. It was all for her friends curiosity and knowledge, there was absolutely no sexuality involved.", "So if I kissed a woman a woman in front of her would it be ok?", "Kissing someone else whilst in a relationship is cheating, you've gotta be pretty dense to not understand that", "I can\u2019t believe you typed that reply and read over it and thought \u201cyup, this is it\u201d  then replied lmao.", "Go ahead, give a '1 sec drunk kiss' to a friend of the gender you're attracted to in front of your partner. See how things turn out for you.", "I don't see it exactly as cheating, because I think cheating involves more intention than a spontaneous non sexual kiss in a joking environment (even when I understand other people would feel this is cheating plain and simple), but it is still very disrespectful with OP and his feelings, and I can understand why he feels hurt and needs some space at this moment. He's not an asshole, imo, just someone who needs time to think and decide if he wants to be involved in that relationship or not.", "My wife would not be happy if I kissed a girl even for one second. I would not be happy if she kissed a guy for even one second. While I wouldn\u2019t mind if my wife kissed a girl for one second, that\u2019s because I have no reason to believe she is anything other than straight, so it would be completely different then her kissing a guy. \n\nIn OPs case his girlfriend said she might be bisexual, so the kiss has the same meaning to her as if it was a guy. I can see why he would be upset.", "Sorry if I didn\u2019t clarify but I was getting her bag as we were getting to leave and I walked back in to the room where everyone was and she kissed her, I don\u2019t think she knew I was right in front of her watching it play out", "Go ahead, give a '1 sec drunk kiss' to a friend of the gender you're attracted to in front of your partner. See how things turn out for you.", "You\u2019re a moron", "I honestly hope so :)", "[deleted]", "It's not about her wanting to fuck the friend or not. Intimacy is exclusive: that also means no kissing. They are in a monogamous relationship and she should behave accordingly."]}
