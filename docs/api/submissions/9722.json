Stepdaughter (Ava, also fake name) is 9f.\n\nIsa's stepfather recently died. I felt terrible because I knew while they weren't super close, he'd been in her life since she was 5, so I knew it must've hit hard. My family was also invited to the funeral.\n\nThe issue is, however, is Ava has horrible social anxiety. She's homeschooled because of it and has difficulty going to social outings. She's in therapy and has an emotional support rabbit named Luna. Since this funeral would be pretty crowded, we decided to let Ava bring Luna to the funeral. Isa had a problem with that.\n\nIsa quickly told me she didn't think it was a good idea. Pets were not allowed at this particular cemetery. I told her this was a rabbit (what harm could it do?) and Ava had a medical reason for bringing her rabbit. She then looked it up on google and showed me only service animals were allowed to come. I told her I'd bring Luna, and if an issue arose, we'd leave. She begged me not to, saying her step-dad's death was already hard enough on her mom, and she didn't want any drama to make it worse. I told her I'd think about it and keep that in mind.\n\nThe thing is, Ava needs her emotional support pet. She wouldn't make it through the funeral if she didn't. She also really wanted Ava there, so what else could we do?\n\nIsa drove to the funeral with her mom, while my family and I drove together. We brought Luna. Isa and her mom were waiting for us at the entrance when we got out. When Isa saw Luna, she freaked out and started yelling that she told me not to bring her.\n\nI explained Ava's needs, and she then screamed that Ava should've just stayed home then and caused Ava to cry (I felt bad because I know she was already dreading the social interaction, so hearing her sister say that must've hurt her badly). My wife and Isa got into it after that. (not so kind words were spoken by either party)\n\nHer mom took Isa's side and told us to leave. I agreed, and we went home. Isa has been giving me the cold shoulder, but I don't know how else I could've handled this differently.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676156297, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1100h2y/aita_for_bringing_an_emotional_support_animal_to/", "score": 1918, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You could have just NOT GONE. This is awful behavior on your part. When someone invites you somewhere, it is on you to be a good guest. You were emphatically told \"No\" to the bunny, but decided to bring it anyway?? Of course YTA, and a rude one to boot.", "YTA. \n\nWhy didn't Ava and your wife just stay home? They were obviously not there to support your older daughter. They aren't grieving family members. They didn't need to be there. \n\nYou made a funeral about Ava and her rabbit. It wasn't the Ava show. It wasn't your show either. And your wife made things worse by getting into it with a grieving teenager and her grieving mother.", "Yta you had 1 job to support your daughter who had lost her step father . Well done for making it all about your golden child", "yta\n\nAva did not need to come. emotional support animals are sometimes not allowed, because everyone can call everything any animal that. \n\nYour daughter lost someone who was a dad to her since she was 5. She asked you to not do this. You did it anyway. You did not know the deceased, neither did Ava. How hard is it to respect someones wishes?", "YTA.  You failed both girls - Isa because you refused to respect her boundary and Ava because you forced her into a social situation and allowed her to bring her rabbit knowing it wasn\u2019t welcome and wouldn\u2019t be well received.  You pretty much created a child with social anxiety\u2019s worst nightmare.  Great job all around, Dad.", "YTA. Since when did this funeral become about you and a rabbit? You were told explicitly not to being animals but you went ahead and decided to disrespect a grieving family\u2019s wishes on probably one of hardest days of their lives and did it anyway.", "YTA. An emotional support animal is a pet, not a service animal. As such, you broke the cemetery's rules (which Isa had made a point of informing you of) and also ignored your grieving daughter's begging for your not to bring Ava with you. \n\nAs far as you, what could you do, your options were clear: you could have left Luna at home and your family could have offered Ava necessary support, you could have spoken with Isa about the fact that it might not be possible for Ava to attend the funeral and checked Isa was okay with that since Luna couldn't attend, or you could have asked someone (an administrator?) for the cemetery if you could get an exemption and then *if* they said yes checked with Isa again if she still had objections to Ava bringing Luna. \n\nAnd really, with the emphasis your elder daughter was making that pets are not allowed at the cemetery and begging you not to bring Luna and to not make a drama, how could you not see that bringing Luna was inevitably going to cause upset.", "YTA, Rabbits aren't service animals or common emotional support animals for a reason: they are so well known for their anxiety that many vets won't work with them because of how easily they can frighten themselves to death. In a safe and accommodating home with minimal surprises, a rabbit can provide emotional support. At a crowded public event, the rabbit NEEDS emotional support.   \n\n\nOthers have mentioned how you should have checked in with the adults involved in organizing the funeral so I'll leave that aside to emphasize that it this was deeply irresponsible caretaking of your daughter and her rabbit. It could have ended much, much worse.", "YTA. You could\u2019ve handled it differently by, idk, LISTENING TO YOUR GRIEVING DAUGHTER. Ugh. Parents like you suck so much", "YTA\n\nYou claim the whole point of going to the funeral was to support Isa.  She told you point blank that bringing that rabbit would only make it worse for her. You essentially told Isa that you dont care about her feelings.\n\nAva was not \u201cprescribed\u201d an emotional support animal.\n\nBut if you feel that insistent that Ava not go anywhere without it, why didn\u2019t you leave Ava home?  Why did you choose A a over Isa?", "YTA. I'm a pro show dog handler that puts about 40k miles on a year traveling with dogs. Here's what you need to know. EMOTIONAL SUPPORT ANIMALS have no legal rights. Isa is correct. Service dogs have rights. ESA's aren't verified, tested or trained to be anything but pets. Again, since you seem to have trouble getting it.... YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO TAKE AN ESA ANYWHERE AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE WITH TRUE SERVICE ANIMALS.", "YTA. You diminished both your daughters fir no reason.  Isa lost someone close to her. She asked you not to bring the rabbit. You dismissed her feelings and devalued her.  She's not a person due respect and empathy.  She's \"just a child\" ( boy, does that phrase say a lot about how we value children ) and so should just get over whatever issue she has and obey the adults.  So you said \"fuck you\" to Isa.\n\nAva has social anxiety. She is 9 years old. It's not a party, It's a fucking funeral.  So you drag Ava along, with her rabbit and take a very difficult ordeal and make it orders-of-magnitude harder for Isa and her mother.  And to add the icing on the cake, you do battle with your grieving daughter and her mother.\n\nMy daughter has a comfort rabbit. She would never try to bring it into a funeral.  She might bring it in the car and visit from time to time if that was feasible for the rabbit. Rabbits, in general, find new situations with lots of people very stressful, so you're not doing the rabbit any favors either.\n\nAnd it's obvious Ava is the golden child. You're far more concerned about Ava than Isa. You had to choose who to support, your daughter, who just lost her stepdad, or your stepdaughter. Seems like maybe you resented the stepfather and wanted to punish your daughter for missing him.  Good job, she'll still miss him, and she might never forgive you.", "YTA. You neglected the emotional needs of one daughter to appease the emotional needs of your other daughter. If Ava\u2019s social anxiety is that bad, then in my opinion, she should have stayed home.", "You care more about Ava than Isa...for that alone YTA.  It was a goddamn funeral where people were grieving, and you somehow thought it was all about Ava.  Because you don't give two shots about how Isa or anyone else at the funeral feels.  It is all about you.  Your wife is TA for going along with this BS.  I feel sorry for Ava when she someday figures out that the world doesn't revolve around her.\n\nGiant YTA", "YTA. What the hell is wrong with you? This was for your daughter Isa and you made it about yourself and your other daughter. She told you exactly what to do, but you didn\u2019t care about her and her feelings and couldn\u2019t actually hear her. Y\u2019all made a scene at the funeral. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "At first I thought I'd be reading about a dog but an effing rabbit? Holy cheesecake Batman, YTA. Way to make the funeral about you.", "YTA on every possible level.  You added unnecessary stress to your grieving daughter and your ex, and you certainly didn't help your stepdaughter. You seem like a control freak.", "YTA \n\n>Pets were not allowed at this particular cemetery. I told her this was a rabbit (what harm could it do?) and Ava had a medical reason for bringing her rabbit.\n\nESA are NOT granted public access rights under the ADA (if this was in the US). \n\nAnd what possible harm could be done if a rabbit got loose in a funeral.", "YTA \n\nIt seems like your function at this funeral was to support Isa in her grief. This is likely also why Ava & your wife were invited as well. If Isa did not want the rabbit to attend, that should have been respected. At best, you should have asked Isa if she would have preferred Ava come with the rabbit or not come at all. \n\nAlso, it\u2019s unsustainable for Ava to never go anywhere without a rabbit. She needs help finding more strategies to cope with this anxiety.", "Yta. A funeral is not an appropriate setting for a rabbit. If your child can't go there without the rabbit due to social anxiety then she should have stayed at home with a sitter.", "YTA. Your stepdaughter should have stayed home if she can't handle social interactions. Sounds like she needs some intensive therapy not a god damn rabbit. It was inappropriate to bring what is a pet with a piece of paper to a place where you were specifically told not to. You've shown your daughter you step daughters feelings matter more to you. She probably thinks you intentionally ruined the funeral of her step father. Good luck recovering from that. Oh also if your wife insulted your daughter on that day even bigger AH.", "YTA\n\nAn ESA is not a service animal. A service animal has training an acclimation to help with specific problems and in varied public situation. So aide from this being against the rules and incredibly inconsiderate to your daughter, it was a cruel thing to do to the rabbit that was probably stressed out of its little mind.\n\nI get that Ava needs an ESA, but that does not give you reason to terrorize or endanger that ESA in the interest of Ava's emotional comfort.", "You don't know how you could have handled it diffrently:\n\noptions:\n\n1 Ava stays at home\n\n\n2 You clear up the rabbit issue with both your ex and the funeral home. And only take Ava if the rabbit can come. If the rabbit can't come... Ava stays home\n\n\n3 Ask Isa if she wants Ava to come with the rabbit, or if she prefers to let Ava stay home. respect that wish.\n\n\n\nThe way you did this:\n\n1: stressed Isa out in one off the worst days off her life\n\n2: made Ava's fears worse and a reality.\n\n3: caused major friction between Ava and Isa\n\n4: showed Isa you don't give a fuck about her wants or needs.\n\n\nHonesty, you could prob not have done worse without breaking a law or two.", "YTA you should have just not gone.", "YTA. A major one. You prioritized your step daughter over your daughter when she needed you the most. WTF? You should have left Ava at home.

You intentionally carried Ava there when there was no need for her presence. **You made Ava's presence and needs  more important than the kid who actually lost a father figure.** You also probably made her lose some feeling of trust in you as a father figure too....", "congrats on showing your daughter that, on a day that was already hard on her emotionally, you would place your emotional energy on a pet rabbit (rabbits are anxious by themselves and you\u2019re calling it an emotional support animal for someone with anxiety?) rather than your grieving daughter.\n\nYTA. you made the funeral about you and your stepdaughter at your daughter\u2019s expense.", "YTA. An emotional support animal is not a service animal and is not a medical need. You were already told that animals were not allowed at the venue and not to bring it.\n\nIf Ava couldn't go anywhere without the rabbit, she shouldn't have gone to the funeral.

Cue the Benny Hill Yakkity Sax music.", "YTA ESA do not have the same rights as service animals. You are adding unnecessary stress to a grieving child. If Ava has such bad anxiety maybe she should say good bye in a different way then goign to the funeral, because of the fact that a crowded place that causes her stress will cause the poor bunny even more stress.

An emotional support animal is not the same as a service animal and the rabbit didn\u2019t have any right to be there. \n\nYou made a series of terrible decisions and I\u2019m sure Isa is incredibly hurt by the selfishness and favoritism you showed.

You made a difficult day even more difficult for your ex-wife and daughter.  The best course of action was for Ava to stay home since she didn\u2019t have to be there.

Daughter (Isa, fake name) is 17f. Stepdaughter (Ava, also fake name) is 9f.\n\nIsa's stepfather recently died. I felt terrible because I knew while they weren't super close, he'd been in her life since she was 5, so I knew it must've hit hard. My family was also invited to the funeral.\n\nThe issue is, however, is Ava has horrible social anxiety. She's homeschooled because of it and has difficulty going to social outings. She's in therapy and has an emotional support rabbit named Luna. Since this funeral would be pretty crowded, we decided to let Ava bring Luna to the funeral. Isa had a problem with that.\n\nIsa quickly told me she didn't think it was a good idea. Pets were not allowed at this particular cemetery. I told her this was a rabbit (what harm could it do?) and Ava had a medical reason for bringing her rabbit. She then looked it up on google and showed me only service animals were allowed to come. I told her I'd bring Luna, and if an issue arose, we'd leave. She begged me not to, saying her step-dad's death was already hard enough on her mom, and she didn't want any drama to make it worse. I told her I'd think about it and keep that in mind.\n\nThe thing is, Ava needs her emotional support pet. She wouldn't make it through the funeral if she didn't. She also really wanted Ava there, so what else could we do?\n\nIsa drove to the funeral with her mom, while my family and I drove together. We brought Luna. Isa and her mom were waiting for us at the entrance when we got out. When Isa saw Luna, she freaked out and started yelling that she told me not to bring her.\n\nI explained Ava's needs, and she then screamed that Ava should've just stayed home then and caused Ava to cry (I felt bad because I know she was already dreading the social interaction, so hearing her sister say that must've hurt her badly). My wife and Isa got into it after that. (not so kind words were spoken by either party)\n\nHer mom took Isa's side and told us to leave. I agreed, and we went home. Isa has been giving me the cold shoulder, but I don't know how else I could've handled this differently.\n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My dog does help my social anxiety but there\u2019s a time and place to bring him. A funeral for a family member who\u2019s next of kin specifically said no pets and where pets are against the rules of the facility is not the place.

Why is only your 9 year olds emotions important? Your 17 year old needed her dad to support, love and prioritise her and you did none of that!", "Yta", "This one is tricky.\n\nLet's start with the daughter. Regardless of animal rules, Isa could have handled this better. It's one thing to discuss if the rabbit can come or not, or to say that you cannot stay because of the rabbit. It's another entirely to scream at the family and cause Ava to cry (given her anxiety, this will be hard for her to let go of and could have easily escalated into an anxiety attack). However, I can see where she was coming from, trying to prevent drama breaking out and follow the rules. She did say not to bring the rabbit.\n\nRight, onto the rabbit. Emotional support animals do not necessarily qualify as service animals (there is no legal register for emotional support animals, so they aren't legally recognised and are not recognised by many facilities), and despite the need for them to help with mental health, they aren't necessarily trained to deal with situations like service animals are. They're more like living comfort blankets. A rabbit isn't going to be able to assist in case of an incident the way a trained service dog can, for example. It's going to be there so its presence comforts Ava.\n\nYou really should have made some phone calls, because a lot of places that allow service animals will not allow emotional support animals (again, they don't necessarily qualify as service animals), with airports being the main exception to that rule. You should have called up the cemetery first, and if they said no, do not bring Luna, that should be the end of it. If they had allowed it, then you should have called Isa's mother to explain the situation and that the cemetery had allowed it.\n\nI'm going with ESH for this one. I can see where you and Isa were both coming from, and what you were both trying to do, but the way this was handled on both of your parts was not good in the slightest, with Isa being verbally aggressive and upsetting Ava, and you for being negligent and not calling around and doing your research on the matter. \n\nIf I had to pick a side though, I'd side with Isa. I'm not entirely sure why Ava needed to be there. Given it was Isa's step-father, you could have easily gone to support your daughter during the funeral, leaving your wife and step-daughter at home. \n\nEDIT: Clarifying the emotional support animal laws. [In the UK, they do not receive legal recognition](https://www.emotionalsupportanimals.org.uk/uk-law/), so what I have said applies. Delving deeper, the US does have legal registry for emotional support/comfort animals. However, service animals in training, emotional support animals and comfort animals (probably the better description for Luna in this case) do not always get recognised as service animals ([for example, they travel as pets and fees still apply](https://www.aa.com/i18n/travel-info/special-assistance/service-animals.jsp)), so Luna may still have not been allowed at the cemetery.\n\nEDIT 2: Reworded some stuff to better portray my judgement.", "I love how everyone thinks you can just not be anxious, and ignoring the fact that the family was invited and the sister wanted them to be there and also magically not be anxious. There wouldn\u2019t have been a problem if the sister hadn\u2019t caused one. The other sister would have been able to deal with the situation and both sister and dad would have been there to support everyone else.", "Assuming the widow wanted AVA there, NTA. \n\nAssuming the deceased is Ava's stepfather as well, NTA. \n\nIf Ava wasn't affiliated with the deceased and wasn't asked to attend than you may be TA. \n\nOtherwise I agree, You were put in a lose-lose situation.
