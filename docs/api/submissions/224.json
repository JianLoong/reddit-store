{"id": 224, "submission_id": "yhqf12", "title": "AITA for not paying to replace the A/C in my Dad's house?", "selftext": "My dad is dying, he has less than a year to live. My dad has a will, each of his kids is getting a big ticket item. His house is willed to me. Out of all my siblings, I'm the only one that doesn't own a home. Right now my husband and I are renting a house.\n\nA few months ago my dad said he wanted to go ahead and sign the deed of the house over to me. He said he wanted to do it when he was alive to make it easier after he dies. He did this for all the big ticket items with my siblings. He signed his SUV, his truck, his motorcycle, and his camper over to my other siblings. BUT he didn't want his kids to actually have anything he signed over until he passed. This included the house, it is in my name, but he is still living in it and me and my husband can't move in.\n\nWell, the thing about my dad is he is cheap as hell. A couple months after signing everything over he tells everyone he expects them to start paying for the registrations, taxes, and insurance on everything in their name. We all figured it out, he didn't want to make thing easier, he wanted us to pay these things for him. So I paid the house taxes and the home owner's insurance for a house I can't even live in. One of my other siblings that got his camper told him to go pound sand, they aren't paying for something they can't use. My dad tried to say that he'd just sell it, and my sibling responded with \"good luck selling something when you don't have the title and it isn't in your name.\" I wish I had my sibling's big brass balls.\n\nLast week the A/C in my dad's house went out. He had someone come out and replace whole the outside unit that died without even telling me any of this was going on. Today he hands me the bill and tells me he wants me to repay him for the cost. I refused and he got super pissed.\n\nBesides the fact that I don't have the money because I just paid his house taxes and insurance and am still paying my rent, I also don't feel like this is my responsibility. Plus don't think it's fair that he didn't even tell me what happened. I feel like we could have gotten the work done cheaper if we got a few quotes. He just went with the first person he called.\n\nThis isn't a case of him not having the money, he's got money. He has two good pensions, one from a union job working for one of the big railroads, and another from a union job work for the state highway department. He also get's social security from him and my mother that passed several years ago, as well as my mother's IRA. Everything he owns is paid off thanks to a life insurance payout from when my mother passed, and his only bills are his cell phone, his internet, and electric bill. He has no medical bills thanks to having really kick has insurance with $0 out-of-pocket. He just doesn't want to pay a few thousand because he's cheap.\n\nAITA for refusing to pay for the A/C?", "created_utc": 1667165130, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yhqf12/aita_for_not_paying_to_replace_the_ac_in_my_dads/", "score": 760, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What he\u2019s doing is blackmailing you all with the promise of extensive loot just so long as you pay for the remainder of his life.

And then you're in charge (which include deciding which workers to hire) for everything. \nHe maybe changed the title, but dosn't make you on the hook for anything.\nNTA", "NAH - I see your point.  I also see your dad's point that this is an improvement to a house that he won't be living in.  It is also pretty much a necessity for quality of life when you are dying.\n\nI just went through losing a parent, and even with kick ass insurance, it is expensive. Necessities for the end of life are expensive.  Maintaining a quality of life until that point is expensive.  To have a good quality of life, instead of just what is required to keep you from dying of neglect, costs so much.  In another comment you said he had 100k.  My parent had about that too, and they were still very worried about money - and they were not cheap or unsupportive of family at all.\n\nIf he is nearing his end of life he is probably on some pretty decent medications too, and they may be causing brain fog, some weird ways of thinking, or almost manic ups that won't make much sense to you.\n\nYour dad did something weird, but that is to be expected.  Well, you know he is cheap and will stick you with the bill, so maybe it was realllly to be expected.  You knew this but entered an agreement because, well, free house.\n\nIf it were me, I would tell him that paying rent and the taxes, insurance, etc.. have stretched your budget as you didn't plan on getting a house this year, while still paying rent.  Tell him you are budgeting to pay for those things next year too, so that he isn't going to have to worry about them when he is ill.  Tell him it is good that he paid for the AC, as you would not have been able to do so.  Tell him that you can work on a payment plan for it of $XX dollars a month, but that is all you have free to spend on house improvement and maintenance while still  paying rent.\n\nThen you need to have a different discussion about end of life and hospice.  When it is time he is going to have the choice to stay at home, or have end of life care in a hospital.  Hospice will  tell you to stay at home.  Don't do this.  Depending on what agency you get, you may not be offered the support to make passing pain free.  I was left with a bottle of oral morphine alone with a parent that was screaming in pain, when I had made that last call because the morphine wasn't working at all.  There was no IV to administer medication, and nothing stronger offered.  All they told me was they wouldn't check to see how much I used after my parent passed, and then they left.  Connect the dots.  No one at their end of life deserves to suffer like that, and no family member deserves to be in that situation. Don't do this at home.\n\nBefore that point if he requires more care later on, that 100k is going to slip through his fingers like water.  Hospice will provide care for free, and it will be good care, but it won't be the same as having someone there that is working just for you and providing you with care and comfort - that will have to come from hiring someone independently.   Cleaning the house, cooking, picking up groceries, just having someone there for support when you bathe - Insurance isn't going to cover those, and your dad is going to have to hire people to take care of these things unless a family member or friend moves in and dedicates themselves to caring for him.\n\nI hate to say it but money is a factor when it comes to quality of care, quality of life, and yes, how long someone has the support they need to keep living, if their choice is to live for every day that they have the opportunity to live.", "Nta but man a lot horrible people thoughts on this sub. \n\nIs op dad doing the wrong thing? Yes. \n\nIs he also giving them a lot as well? Yes\n\nJust take the L, stop being greedy. Some people get nothing, some people care more about their parents than money. \n\nThey will have to wait til he dies to gather around like vultures to get everything but that is usually how it works.", "~~YTA~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~YOu just got gifted a house, and are quibbling over the price of a new AC?~~\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: YOu did not yet get the house?

He's basically  your tenant. Its your house, not his. If its in your name its not like he xan take it back. Start the eviction process if he pushes. But also protect yourself and your siblings. It isn't just that easy to sign things over.  What he did is make sure you guys escaped estate taxes which could be the cost of the AC.

He kicked every single one of his kids out of the house exactly on their 18th birthday or sometime earlier, and completely cut them off from financial help. After his kids turned 18 he wouldn't even lend them $5 if they needed it.\n\nHe's now got well over $100k in the bank, which he is giving away to some woman we've never met when he dies. We don't care about the money, we are happy with what we are getting, I'm just pointing it out to show that he can easily afford the cost.", "She doesn\u2019t have $20k! He should have had a discussion with her.", "Agreed, they don't care about him at all. They are vultures waiting for him to die.", "He\u2019s cheap? He literally gave her a house to move in within a year. For free.", "Sounds like the dad already paid for it because OP said \"repay\" and not pay.", "As a homeowner, he can dispute liens for work he did not autorize. And sue the company to reinstall the old one.", "She cannot AFFORD the to pay for the AC because she just had to pay taxes and insurance for the house, plus she is still paying rent where she lives. Her dad didn\u2019t say \u201cthe AC went out, and we need to get a new unit,\u201d he just called and had one installed, then handed OP the bill.", "He can more than afford to replace it. If he wants to be comfortable he can pay for it.", "Is it really mine if I can't move into it, he's not paying me rent, and I still have to pay to rent another house?", "I\u2019m sorry but I\u2019ve got to go YTA or ESH. And not because you don\u2019t want to pay the bill but because of how you guys are going about it. This man is dying and the conversations have already turned all to money.\n\nI think it\u2019s more than reasonable to say \u201chey, with everything else, I can\u2019t afford to pay this right now\u201d but the tone around everything else between you and your siblings seem awful. \n\nI also can\u2019t believe people are literally suggesting to evict him. Good Lord", "From what OP said, it's already in her name, meaning it's going to be quite a bit more expensive for her than if it was just through inheritance.", "In my experience houses that have been held by parents who are aging often aren\u2019t a great deal. Usually there is a lot of deferred maintenance, and they cost a lot to get in shape to sell. In OPs case they will also have to pay a chunk in capital gains when selling if the house has appreciated since rather than inheriting the house it\u2019s been given to them while their parent is still alive. I\u2019m so sorry OP didn\u2019t realize or know this, but a parent handing over real estate like this isn\u2019t a good idea.", "Ugh. Well, I guess you could look at in the sense that when you eventually move in, you\u2019ll at least have a shiny new AC system\u2026 tough call and kind of unfair on his part to go ahead with all this, in this manner.", "It's not blackmail.  The deed has been signed over to OP.  There is nothing legally stopping OP and husband from moving into house or even kicking dad out of house.  Grow some of those brass balls and take action.  You own the house!!  It's not something you \"get\" later.  It's yours now.  NTA for not paying.  It was done without your knowledge or consent.", "NTA but if the house is in your name and someone doesn't pay the bill then the contractor will put a lein on the house, or possibly take you to court because your name is on the title, not your dads.\n\nIf your name is on the title of the house then you have the right to evict him. I know it sounds cruel but your dad is playing a crappy game that has now created a debt for you that could ruin your credit and get you taken to court. Maybe the threat of eviction will force his hand into paying the AC contractor.", "Until he decides to change it", "You mentioned deeds elsewhere, that might(? depending on location and exact circumstances eg who is holding the deed, is it legally signed over, etc) be okay but he could make up a second will any time he likes and just show you the old one, the latter dated will would be the legal will (you can fight it but that costs and there's an even chance you're lose, again *very* circumstance-dependant!), or he could just tear it up to be spiteful.", "Where\u2019s the money going?", "Wow, shocker. You got a house from your dad who has less that a year to live and you and your siblings have studied the will well enough. For your dad\u2019s sake, I wish he was smart enough to not offer you or your siblings anything.", "What are you talking about? There's no income tax owed on gifts. There's a gift tax, but that only kicks in after ~$12 million in gifts ($24 million for married couples).", "If so, then I misread it. I thought. He took the bill and just gave it to her, not that he wants repayment. If it\u2019s repayment, then the lien isn\u2019t an issue, so that\u2019s good. \n\nBut you can\u2019t have tenants making repairs to property without the owners consent and agreement. Though it could be argued that him living rent free but paying for upkeep and repairs is his rent. \n\nRegardless, she needs a lawyer. This is a messed up situation.", "If he's in the states, the owner of a house, etc is responsible for the repair and upkeep of the property. The father is considered a tenant, living rent free. Normally when something breaks tenants notify the owners and the owners decide when to let tge tenant fix it and deduct off of next months rent, or owner fixes it. The other comment is right if you dont pay it, the ac people can put a lien on the house. That just means you cant sell it until the lien is paid. You need to set rules with him that since you're the owner, you get to make all the decisions. And if you want to live there, there's nothing legally stopping you.", "It\u2019s in OP\u2019s name. They\u2019re paying taxes and insurance. And to replace things, apparently. All while presumably still paying rent elsewhere and not collecting rent from dad.\n\nWhy can\u2019t they move in?", "There are legal scenarios in which this is not true. Dad may have reserved a life estate for himself.", "Given his age and health he might actually have grounds to put up a fight. If nothing else he could twist it in a way that has the police very interested well after he dies.", "This is entirely false. BBB does get some results depending on the issue. 2 years of fighting my cable company due to internet issues resolved in 2 months after a BBB report. \n\nCorporate escalations called me to resolve the issue and it led to weekly meetings with the plant supervisor. As opposed to 2 years of calling the call center and getting a tech out who couldn't do shit.", "It's not the HVAC company's fault! They're going to do the work if someone hands them a check no questions asked.", "Yes I am, the house is in my name at this point. The deal was he signed the house over to me, but he gets to keep living in it and I can't move in until he dies. Yes, this is a verbal deal, and I recognize I could just tell him to go screw himself and kick him out and move in, but then I know I'd be the asshole.", "That legally means nothing", "Sure you can.", "With that background, please explain why you would feel bad evicting him and living in your house?

Dad just wants me to pay him back for the cost.", "You got a freeloader in your house.

I own 25% of my parents house, my sister too but as long as one of my parents is leaving we have no say on them using it.

That could be the deal here which if that is the case there isn't anything she could do.", "I don't think kicking him out is the answer. But maybe dad is about to get 2 new roommates. After all, OP has to save that rent money to pay for the a/c on their house.", "Bruh shut up", "Yeah no the fact he has less than a year to life means they would be wrong to kick him out of the house he gifted them.

But don\u2019t pay for the AC to be replaced. It\u2019s not your responsibility if you\u2019re not there to use it.

This amount follows you into death to become the estate tax (edit: exclusion)\n\nFor example, if you make reported gifts during your life totaling $5m then die with a $20m estate, the $5m isn't taxed since it's under the lifetime exclusion limit, and the first $7m of your estate isn't taxed either because combined they are under $12m.

He will owe tax on the value of the things he signed over in excess of $15k for each kid.
