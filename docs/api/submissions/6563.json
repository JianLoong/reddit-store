We have been planning on remodeling our kitchen for years. Over the past year, I've been getting quotes, researching different cabinets and countertops, etc.\n\nNow that we settled on a design and were ready move on it, she says she doesn't have the money to contribute anything because she's been paying her mom's medical bills. The part about not having the money isn't exactly true.\n\nHer dad, who's divorced from her mom, was a farmer and sold a lot of land last year. He gave her $100,000 as a gift. That's her money to do whatever she likes with and I'm fine with that. The issue is her mom came down with some sort of rash that the doctors haven't figured out. Compounding the problem, she has no medical insurance.\n\nThe reason she doesn't have medical insurance is because she's a conservative and refused to get insurance simply because it was mandated in Obmacare. I know this because I used to do her taxes for her and she lied on her returns about having insurance so she wouldn't have to pay the penalty.\n\nI told her that was a bad idea on two counts. She could get caught if she were audited. And she could come down with a serious illness with huge medical bills. She didn't listen.\n\nNow 5+ years after that conversation, my wife has paid over $30,000 in medical bills for her. I told her if she wants to pay her bills, that's fine but it should come out of the money her dad gave her. She says I'm being a complete asshole and her mom's health is the only real concern here.\n\nAs a side note, her mom remarried a few years ago. He could pay her bills, but my wife says she doesn't want to ask him because he's retired and his money should go to his kids. I can't find any logic in any of this. But maybe I'm the one being unreasonable here.\n\nEDIT\n\nA little more context might help explain where my wife and MIL are coming form here. They're from Lithuania, so there's a cultural component to it. Adult kids are responsible for their parents way more so than here.\n\nHer mom was a doctor in the Soviet Union before the collapse. The two of them moved here in the late 90s when my wife finished high school.\n\nMy MIL worked under a program that let foreign doctors work as nurses. She did 60 hours a week in a hospital, then worked nights and weekends in home hospice care to pay for my wife's education \u2013 college, then nursing school, then a nurse practitioner program. They were here on visas and then permanent residents at the time and did not qualify for in-state tuition, so she paid about three times what most people pay.\n\nSo when my MIL asked for money, there was no question in my wife's mind that she should pay. I'm perfectly fine with her helping out, but disagree on where the money should come from.\n\nRegarding her rash, it's pretty severe. It covers her entire body and face. She says she's suicidal. She first went to an ER and was admitted to the ICU. They discharged her and said she needed out-patient care. She tried to see a dermatologist, but the soonest appointment was in six months. She repeated the process at five more ERs and ICUs.\n\nSince then, she has  flown back to Lithuania to take advantage of their socialized medicine. She's now hospitalized for $50 a week. I'm sure she doesn't see the irony, but at least we're off the hook for any more major expenses.", "created_utc": 1672942570, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1045uw2/aita_for_asking_my_wife_not_to_spend_our_money_on/", "score": 201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And why isn't he helping his wife with her medical bills?", "Want to bet mom feels \u201cowed\u201d that money from the ex husband, and that\u2019s why she\u2019s guilting the daughter into paying it? So mom can get her \u201cshare\u201d of her ex\u2019s land $$?", "MIL has $6K monthly rental income. It sounds like she could pay her own medical bills but prefers to make her daughter pay instead.", "I read the \"she\" as being the mom, as in she (mom) doesn't want to ask her own husband; not as being OPs wife.\n\nRegardless, OPs wife is enabling her mom's ongoing bad decision making, and OP is NTA.", "By going in and out of six different ERs and getting admitted. Her rash is severe, coving her entire body and face. She's said she's suicidal. As much as I disagree with her on many things, I have a lot of sympathy for her.\n\nShe would go to an ER, they would admit her to an ICU and then they would discharge her saying it's out-patient care. She would try to make an appointment with a dermatologist and they would tell her the first available appointment is in six months. So she repeated the process over and over. \n\nI didn't include this, because it wasn't overly relevant, but she has since flown to Lithuania to take advantage of their socialized healthcare. She's originally from there. She's now paying $50 a week and we're off the hook from any further expenses. I'm sure the irony is completely lost on her.", "He also sucks for the sheer entitlement to her money and telling her what to do with it ffs.", "I think she'll come around. I'm mostly just venting here and wrapping my head around the situation. \n\nThe quote we have on the cabinets expires this week. Then goes up 10% with the new year pricing. Which is a 2K difference. And who knows what might happen with countertops and everything else. We're at about 25K now. I could see it easily being 30-35K a year from now.\n\nI've told her that and she does want to remodel. She just wanted to put it off a year and pay for it without touching her dad's money. But I think the difference in cost will be enough to motivate her.", "My take on her relationship with her husband is they were two old, lonely people who met on [match.com](https://match.com) and didn't have anything in common besides their politics. Not the strongest of connections there. I'm sure for him his kids' inheritance comes first. And he doesn't like me any more than I like him. So he's more than happy to stick it to me.", "Ummmm no that doesn\u2019t make sense. You don\u2019t pay for your child\u2019s education just to lord it over them later. Your MIL is in a bind of her own making", "Well your MIL didn't pay for YOUR education, the money should come out of a non-joint account.", "Yeah, no. Even if you want to go with that argument, then your wife and MIL should agree that the payment stops once the outlay matches what MIL paid for college--not adjusted for inflation. Depending on when/where she studied, $30,000 may have already covered it. \n\nI agree NTA. It's admirable your wife wants to help her mother, but she should not take it out of a group account without your knowledge and consent. It also could affect the financial future of both of you because the planned renovations likely will increase the value of your current home.", "People who can communicate with their spouse?", "Most married men I know don\u2019t have a $30k+ wife problem and an insane MIL\u2026..", "Sounds like she needs to take care of her own shit", "That makes a lot more sense. Full-body rash making her suicidal is not the impression I got from the post.", "Okay, I misunderstood - and missed some info.  If your MIL has THREE rental properties, there\u2019s no reason on earth she shouldn\u2019t pay herself.  I had assumed she needed the charity.", "I think you misread something. OP is fine with the wife spending her own money on the medical bills. OP objects to using their joint finances on mother-in-law's medical bills.", "And then people say romance is dead...!! Your wife really needs to see her mother for what she is: a big mouth who doesn't take responsibility for her own actions. Which also aligns with her politics I guess.", "Do you have completely separate finances?\n\nWhat's the difference between the money coming out of the 100k in savings, vs some other account of hers?\n\nOr did she spend money out of a joint account on the medical bills?\n\nEither way, how is she saying she \"doesn't have the money to contribute anything\" if she just got a $100k gift??", "She's pulling in about 6K a month in rental income. Which was her retirement plan. Not saying it was a good plan, but I think it counts as retired.", "For a little more context, there's a cultural component to this. They're from Lithuania. My MIL was a doctor in the Soviet Union. \n\nShe moved here in the late 90s when my wife was a kid. She worked under a program that lets foreign doctors work as nurses.\n\nShe worked 60 hours a week in a hospital, then worked nights and weekends in home hospice care to put my wife through college, nursing school, then a nurse practitioner program so that she wouldn't have any debt. At the time, they were permanent residents and didn't qualify for in-state tuition. So it was three times what most people pay.\n\nKids are responsible for their parents in her culture way more so than here. So that plays a part in it. When her mom asked for money, there was no question in her mind about sending it.", ">I told her if she wants to pay her bills, that's fine but it should come out of the money her dad gave her.\n\nThe part I quoted above is from the original post.

Which she can't- her daughter is helping.\n\nBecause her husband refused to probably because he refused to spend money on her choices. Cuz I imagine he has health insurance.", "Then why does she need your wife's money? She's making as much money as an average household off her rental(s). Is she seeing the most expensive dermatologists in the area to diagnose this thing? Is she paying for experimental treatments or something? Do these doctors not allow her to set up payment plans?", "Thank you, yes I understand more with the background. I think the phrase \u201cshe owes her\u201d is what made it seem icky as well. Does your wife see how this medical bill issue is her mother\u2019s own fault? I understand helping your parents out, I definitely would, but this seems extreme both in the amount and the reason", "Your wife should not be using joint marital funds to bankroll her mother.

My wife sent her money when she ran out.\n\nI edited my post with more details that answer your other questions.", "My wife is coming off worse than she deserves here. She did suggest she work weekends doing home hospice. She's a nurse practitioner working as a nurse manager right now. We have a young son so I'd rather not have her gone all the time.\n\nAlso, she wants to push it back a year so she can save without dipping into her dad's money. The problem being all the hours and hours of leg work I've done will go out the window and the cost could go up significantly.", "You cannot edit the title on Reddit.", "Yes, I'm not saying the OP's mother-in-law is being wise. She's definitely not. There's a reason for the saying \"a fool and her money are soon parted.\" It wouldn't really matter how much money she made per month if she continues to be foolish. \n\nI'm saying the mother-in-law's foolishness isn't because she is choosing not to work; she has a good income stream. Even if she was employed full time, she could still be in the predicament if she refused (and continues to refuse) to buy health insurance.", "Except, OP\u2019s wife is the fool in this story."]}
