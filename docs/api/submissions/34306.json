That's pretty dire if you ask me.", "Prove it or i call Shenanigans \ud83d\ude39", "it is kind of a cultural thing, i'm not from the U.S and it is not 'normal' for young couples to sleep together at parent's houses in my country. I have to say they are pretty chill in every other way, we have slept together away on vacations. \n\ni can't really move out yet as my parents are still paying for college and my job doesn't pay enough for me to cover both school and life costs.", "I\u2019m 21 and I\u2019m from the U.S. I live at home and contribute to bills while being in school, but I\u2019m not allowed to have sleepovers either\ud83d\ude05.

It\u2019s like 90% of the time that even the smallest issues are treated as complete deal breakers. It\u2019s honestly just sad, even sadder because half of y\u2019all probably look at divorce rates and lament as though your attitudes aren\u2019t part of the problem.\n\nI mean, what\u2019s wrong with a few sessions of couple\u2019s therapy, and a pillow gift to sleep with? Is it really that hard to imagine an amicable solution?\n\nAnd the saddest part is the complete lack of nuance. Even if this is a deal breaker for you personallu, saying that OP\u2019s partner views her as an \u201cemotional service animal\u201d based on a couple lines of text? I mean what kind of opinion even is that?

He can't do both, game with his friends until early morning, and be with her before going to sleep. \n\nNot everything is about finding a compromise between two people. She doesn't need to compromise her need of sleeping so he can do what he wants, when he wants. Sometimes, just one people need to decide what is most important for them.\n\nSo he has to decide: game with friends for not so long (or game earlier) and go to sleep with her girlfriend or game with their friends until whatever hour he wants and go to sleep without bothering her.", "She has asked him not to do it and she has explained why.  At that point he is not \"being obtuse\".  He's showing her that he doesn't care about her needs.", "Ehhh they\u2019re not controlling at all.

Some parents just have different beliefs about spending the night under their roof.", "The parents get to decide who sleeps in *their* house.", "It\u2019s hilarious you guys actually think this is solely about his sleeping habits and not separation anxiety + a lack of ability to adjust to new routines. You avoid couple therapy like the plague calling it \u201cunreasonable\u201d in comparison to breaking up when OP and her partner have already made it quite clear they need help in their communication. You think OP is really better off coming here and listening to us dolts telling her to break things off, rather than the two of them spending an hour of their lives to work out their emotional detachment issues with an unbiased professional?"]}
