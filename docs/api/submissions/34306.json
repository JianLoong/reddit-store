Eventually, we dealt with different work schedules so it wasn\u00b4t always possible.\n\nCurrently, I wake up at 5:30 in the morning to go to work. He is unemployed, but we are both working on our college thesis. He stays up gaming with his friends or watching series until 2:00-4:00 a.m, and then wakes up in the afternoon.\n\nRecently, he has been gaming more and more, and most days we stop talking at around 10-11 at night. because he wants to go play with his friends. He has even interrupted our activities together, like watching a movie, because he wants to go play. Sometimes it feels like he is not prioritizing the few moments we have together, because I am busy with work and college.\n\n(We do know each other, we have dates every week, we hang out together at school or at our houses)\n\nI have told him that if he goes to play, he shouldn't call me at 2 or 3 am, because I have to wake up early, but he says he wants to sleep with me in Discord. I told him he chooses to do that once he leaves, so he shoud go sleep by himself at that point and not wake me up.\n\nHe says he needs me, he has depression and anxiety, and that I should be there for him.\n\nI tell him to always call me if he is feeling really bad, but most times its just because he wants to sleep with company.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for telling him to stop calling me at night?\n\nEDIT: So I feel like I should clarify things. I don't answer the calls, they don't happen every night and most times I don't even notice them until next morning. That doesn't make it better but at least they don't tend to interrupt my sleep.\n\nSecond, I talked to him about it. I let him know that I was not gonna tolerate him interrupting our activities to go play (something he can do any other time, but not me) and that I wasn't going to let him call me after I sleep. He apologized, said I was right and that he felt bad about the whole thing. Let's see how that goes.\n\nAnd third, he has been a great boyfriend, respectful, not at all controlling or demanding. This issue has appeared in the last couple of months, as he had to quit work to work on his thesis, but now he says he can't concentrate in it and thus the excessive gaming started.\n\nSo thanks everyone for your comments, they have been very insightful and please keep sharing your thoughts!", "created_utc": 1704368461, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18yb6e0/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_not_to_call_me_at/", "score": 526, "replies": ["NTA- this is basic boundary stuff.\n\n>He says he needs me, he has depression and anxiety, and that I should be there for him.\n\nYou're his girlfriend, not his therapist.", "NTA, he just using you whenever he wants to sleep.
