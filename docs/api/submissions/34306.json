A 2am non-emergency call from ANYONE would be a massive social no-no and a romantic partner should uphold a higher standard of social conduct than you would expect of a random acquaintance, not lower.  \n\nIt seems from your post like the phone calls are just one aspect of a range of problems you\u2019re having with this guy and I\u2019m not going to get into the rights and wrongs of those, but he definitely needs to stop calling you at stupid times and you\u2019re not at all the AH for calling him out on that.", "NTA.  It's not your job to mess up with your sleep schedule to accommodate his game playing and/or his anxiety and depression.  He should get some medical help with the latter and, if necessary, turn off his rig at night. For all that he knows, his lousy sleeping habits are contributing to his anxiety and depression.", "NTA. You\u2019ve set your boundaries, and they seem like fair ones.\n\nAlso, nearly EVERYBODY deals with depression or anxiety at some point in their life. It\u2019s a pretty lame attempt at manipulation.", "NTA - he is ignoring your very reasonable boundaries.", "NTA. He can\u2019t just do whatever he wants for his convenience and shouldn\u2019t use depression and anxiety to guilt trip you into breaking your sleeping schedule.", "Nope.  NTA.  Why does he think it's okay to interfere with your sleep?  Boy needs some coping mechanisms and a lot more respect for you/your job.", "NTA\n\nWhy the hell would he be calling you at 2/3 a.m.??? Even if you didn't have to wake up early, if you're already asleep it makes no sense for him to wake you up just so he can fall asleep, wtf.", "NTA - and, honestly, how much thesis work is happening if he's sleeping into every afternoon and gaming with friends all night?", "NTA. Not at all. \n\nThe \u2018I need you because of my depression/anxiety\u2019 is basic manipulation bullshit. I would not be tolerating that. Maybe if he fixes his sleep pattern, stops spending all his time gaming, and gets a job - it could well do wonders in terms of his mental health.\n\nMore fundamentally, you\u2019ve got a mismatch in terms of schedules, likely in terms of lifestyle, and - I\u2019m guessing - in terms of life aspirations. If he isn\u2019t able to get his shit together, I\u2019d be asking myself, \u2018where is this relationship going really\u2019.", "NTA, dude needs to learn to sleep on his own.", "NTA his sleep doesn't take priority over yours and if he needs support with his mental health, he should seek professional help and not put it on his girlfriend (who I assume isn't qualified to give him the level of support he needs).", "NTA. It\u2019s his job to find ways to deal with depression and anxiety so that he can sleep by himself like an adult. It\u2019s not your job nor anyone else\u2019s to soothe him every single night.", "What is this sleeping on discord non sense. Have you to even met or do u ever meet?", "NTA. This is basic stuff in a relationship. And you are supposed to help your partner with things. He should understand that you have to wake up early and then go to work as well. If you stay up, it will spoil your mood and affect your health.   \nIf you have been dating for two years, I'm sure you will be able to make him understand that this is not done. From what you're saying, this sounds like he is priotorising gaming with friends first and then talking to you. I did this briefly, but then I got an earful and from then on, always just texted goodnight or sent some sweet text and called the day after.", "He needs to be calling some unemployed person lull him to sleep. I would find a boyfriend more considerate, less needy, without a capital L Tattooed on his Forehead. NTA", "If I'm being honest, girl, if he REALLY needs you, you should be there for him, but if it's continues, then, therapy baby.  BUT from what you've said idk maybe im wrong, be he seems like he just wants the attention since he \"interupts \\[your\\] activities together\" to play, and then when his friends leave, he calls you. Idk correct me if I'm wrong.  It's also kinda a boundary thing, if he does not respect your boundaries, then he's the a not you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

In a relationship both sides needs to be concerned with the needs of the other, and it sounds like your BF is only concerned with what *he* needs, not you. Your need to be well rested for work trumps his desire to talk to you when he gets done gaming, because gaming is a choice for him. \n\nHe\u2019s being immature because he is expecting you to be available for him on call like a streaming service as opposed to seeing you as a person with wants, needs, and obligations of your own.
