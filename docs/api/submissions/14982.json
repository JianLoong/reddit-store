No way in hell the water was what broke it", "It was probably already broken and she was looking for a way to replace it for free.", "thank you", "My Pixel 3A got run over by a car in a puddle and still worked.", "NTA \n\nNever been a line cook, but 1 coworker of mine told me a story about leaving stuff on the line. Don't leave your stuff in a high traffic area.", "NTA\n\nWhat she did was stupid and unsanitary.", "NTA 10000%. coming from someone who\u2019s spent time working in kitchens, that\u2019s so incredibly stupid.  if anyone had done that in the kitchen i worked in the whole kitchen team would\u2019ve laughed their asses off at them because it\u2019s their own fault for being stupid", "What kind of phone nowadays isn\u2019t at least partially water resistant?  Also, who the hell hides a phone in a pot, in a busy kitchen?  \n\nMaybe she already broke it and was looking for someone to guilt trip into replacing it for her. \n\nYou are NTA.", "NTA \nShe\u2019s the dummy it\u2019s on her. \nShe played a stupid game and won a stupid prize", "Here\u2019s the million dollar question\u2014exactly what was her phone doing in a pot on top of a shelf? Was she hiding it for some weird reason? That\u2019s odd.", "NTA. \n\nAnd no, I do not want today\u2019s special: Cellular Soup", "NTA", "NTA. Who in their right mind puts a phone in a pot? Whether in a busy kitchen or not, that's not a good place for a phone. And for anyone to say you need to replace it or offer to is ludicrous. If she'd idk had her phone in her pocket, her purse, her car she wouldn't be having an issue. It's her own stupid fault she put it in a POT in a KITCHEN. Besides that phone is more than likely water resistant and she's just blowing things out of proportion.", "NTA- Perhaps it's time for your workplace to host a refresher on food safety- the phone should have never been in the pot!", "NTA and this is very in hygienic. Your phone goes everywhere and is placed on every surface. Unless you co-worker is disinfecting her phone thoroughly every time she leaves it in the kitchen", "NTA, sounds like someone may have put it there in order to get a pay off. No reasonable person would put a phone in a frequently used pot up in a shelf, why not on the actual shelf.", "Nta, she put it in the pot, and it should dry out just fine. I was actually amazed way back when I had a galaxy s 20( I think)  I spilled sticky coffee on it and the company told me to wash it under running water, to get the stickiness off. A 1500 phone should be pretty water resistant. I think shes trying to con you", "My guess is that the phone was already broken and this was a setup by the coworker to get a free replacement out of it. Because who in their right mind would keep their very expensive phone in there?", "NTA - Who puts a phone in a pot in a commercial kitchen??  That's on her!   I suspect she may have done it deliberately to try and get someone to buy her a new phone!", "NTA. $1500 phones are IP68.", "NTA, that pot should have been empty anyway, and a pot is no place to store her phone, especially a frequently used one.", "my thoughts exactly, who thinks putting a phone in a pot is a good idea", "Actually there was originally rice in the pot with the phone, but it all got absorbed.\n\nNow OP needs to pay for the phone AND the rice!", "My phone (Nokia) went through the washing machine,  and still worked.", "Pro Max is", "Would upvote 10 times if could because this is exactly what a dodgy scammer would do", "If you're playing music on your phone, a big metal bowl or pot will amplify it. I've done it before, but not in a bustling kitchen lol", "I think she\u2019s trying to scam you", "I dropped one of my old ones in a deep puddle when it had a badly cracked screen with a hole in it. You could see a microchip in the hole. It STILL worked afterwards. I've dropped at least 2 in the sink before. Both still worked.\nI feel co-worker is trying it on.\n Either way, OP is NTA. In a pot, wtf??", "Remember the 3310? (Depends how old you are) Could build a nuclear bunker out of those.", "Nokia's could go through a nuclear bombing and still come out intact. Who are you kidding? lmao", "The \"Scam money out of my coworker to replace my not-remotely-damaged-by-their-actions phone\" model also runs a cool $1500, I've been thinking about getting one myself.  \n\nI have reservations about \"haha sucker\" appearing 6 times in the fine print though."]}
