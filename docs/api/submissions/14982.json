A $400 iPhone SE or Pixel 7 is ip68 water resistant, which can EASILY survive a pot of water. Either her phone is old af and isn't worth $1500 anymore, or its worth $1500 and would survive a pot of water. Youre getting scammed.", "NTA I bet she didn't go to HR because she knew her phone was not supposed to be there. Also this seems kind of fishy. Why leave an expensive phone laying around.", "NTA\nI once had a boyfriend who put my camera in the oven as a joke and when I came home to preheat the oven for dinner, my apartment was filled with smoke five minutes later. \nAsshole.", "NtA, don't you dare pay", "NTA. That\u2019s a stupid place to put it and frankly disgusting considering how many people wander their phones on the toilet.", "NTA. Former restaurant manager here.... I'd hazard a guess your company policy is no phones on the line but that management doesn't mind as long as it's not a problem. So that would make her in the wrong no matter what as her phone should be \"put up\".\n\nEven if that's not the case, again, it's her responsibility to put the phone out of harms way when working. My boh employees would put their phones in hard to reach places as they were allowed to listen to music through a single ear bud as long as they could still hear my expo. If their phone got wet or covered in pancake batter, etc, that was on them. You don't bring an electronic to a kitchen without knowing the hazards :)", "NTA. Am I the only one suprised that a $1500 phone isn't water resistant? I:m also thinking it was already broken.", "NTA. This sounds like a scam. Don't give her any money.

Coworker might have learned a lesson on where to leave phones.", "NTA .That pretty gross. So many germs are on phones (we all take them to read reddit or whatever when we poop let's be honest).

Putting a phone in a pot in a RESTAURANT KITCHEN is just ridiculous. What's next, inside a trash bin so she could then complain that the garbage disposal truck took it away? And immediately jumping to ask for an exorbitant amount, it's just too fishy. The phone was most likely already broken.", "I wondered about that just because why else would there be a phone in a pot?!", "Not really sure if this is the same thing, but when I worked at a Papa John's, people would commonly put their phones in the metal or plastic containers we would use for toppings and such. It acted as a makeshift speaker so people could play music. I've seen restaurant related memes joking about that exact scenario. Again I don't think this applies to this particular situation, but I just thought I'd explain why some people do it.", "\"Why the hell did she do that? \" ... making some money with an already broken phone.", "Very good point about the hygiene aspect.", "Glad someone has said this! Most people tend to bring their phones with to the bathroom, and don't generally antibac phones, laptops, tablets etc. The phone shouldn't be in a space where food is prepped. Talk about E.

I asked her why she put it there, and she said it doesn't matter why it was there, I should have paid attention.", "Her home insurance would probably cover it.", "Nope. There was no music playing.

Being vague about why she put it there confirms it. The phone was already broken and she's looking for someone gullible to pay for a replacement.\n\nIsn't it against the health code to put foreign objects into pots? Even assuming that she took it out before the pot was used, it's a health risk because phones can carry A LOT of germs and dirt. Bring this up with management. Not only are you not liable for the phone, but your coworker deseves a reprimand at the very least.", "She probably broke the phone herself and wants you to cover a new one. Dont fall for it"]}
