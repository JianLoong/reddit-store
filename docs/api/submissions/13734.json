BUT keep the extra cash aside. Depending on your state / country they can legally demand it back within a period of time that varies wildly based on where you are. Look up the laws of your geo, don't bank on that cash until you're out of that period.", "NTA. They need to sort out their payroll issues. But that said, the law in most places says they can come for the excess money for a period of like a year, and if you're direct depositing they will just take it back straight out of your bank account. So just make sure you don't spend the excess.", "NTA\n\nHowever, someone, somewhere is going to notice eventually. The question will be if they notice in a timeframe that means you will have to pay the extra back. Which could be annoying.\n\nIn your shoes, I would make one more attempt to fix the problem. Don\u2019t go to Payroll. Instead, alert the person in charge of this side jog or your own manager, and ask for their help in fixing the matter, as your *three* attempts to fix the mistakes have not worked. \n\nMake sure to do so in writing so that you have proof that you made yet another attempt. \n\nThen make a record of all communication about the matter, saving any emails or texts involved, recording dates/times of phone conversations, and any other info you have. Just to CYA if anyone comes questioning what has been going on.", "NTA but I would take it to a higher authority instead of not reporting it just in case it would affect things like your tax withholding.", "YWNBTA, but the thing about mistakes is that when they discover it, and it could be a year later, they will deduct what they over paid you and they will pay you what they owe. In the end, assuming they are paying attention to the details at the end of the year, it\u2019ll balance. It could be a super nice bonus for you or a pain in the ass. You should either keep reporting to save yourself the possible headache or stop doing the side job all together.", "NTA, your company is responsible for making sure employees are paid the correct amount. Especially since you've already told them twice that there was a mistake, I would do the same thing. Especially since it then affects how much take home pay you have the next week, it's an inconvenience to you.", "NTA. But it really needs to be figured out. I guess legally speaking they could come at you for any overpayment one day, but honestly it sounds like they don\u2019t pay enough attention to even notice.", "NTA, its their mistake and they have to fix it. However, instead of going to the person making the mistake, try going to HR, the head of payroll, and/or your supervisor. Get to the bottom of this problem; it's possible it could be intentional on the part of the person who's doing it, especially if it's always the same person. If they have someone who's incompetent, they need to let that person go. Either way it's something that's costing the company money, which they'll try to avoid like the plague.", "NTA. Since you're salaried, I'm assuming they pay you bi-weekly. Could that be what this is about? They think you're reporting 2 weeks, so they take the number of hours and double it? I have no idea.. . Just guessing. But no, let it be. They have heard from you and for whatever reason, are continuing to make the same mistake. So keep very careful track. Scan images of the original timesheet and the corresponding pay you get. Also make sure that your emails to them are permanently on file with you and accessible. Sooner or later, someone is going to wake up and no doubt you will be expected to return the money. So be prepared.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have no clue why this mistake keeps happening but you\u2019re right, it\u2019s always exactly double the time I\u2019ve worked.
