We had Jess when we were very young so we had to work to give her a good life and neither of went to college. Because of that we said that we'd like if our daughters could attend college as it will open a lot of doors for them, so we created a college fund for each of them when Rachel was around three years old. \n\nOver the years we have been adding money to it and even though it wasn't enough to cover the full price (we live in the US) it was good money when Jess was ready to start college. But she said she didn't wanted to and she wanted to start a family instead. My wife and I tried to convince her but she didn't listen. She ended up marrying her high school boyfriend when she was 20 and she gave birth to their first baby shortly after that. They have three kids together. \n\nWell on the other hand, Rachel is very excited to finally attend college next year. She wants to be a surgeon which would make us very proud. Med school is very expensive so given as Jess never went to college and we still had the money we decided to use that money to pay for Rachel's tuition. \n\nHere comes the issue. Jess and her husband are about to divorce. Jess came last week to visit us and asked if we could give her the money from her college fund, she wants to use it to rent a house as soon they'll have to leave the place we're they're living now (they are renting) and she's an stay at home mom so she'll need to wait until the divorce is done to get some money from her ex husband. My wife and I told them that we gave that money to Rachel to pay her college tuition. She got very angry and asked us why we did that with her money. I told her that that money was ours, not hers, and that it was supposed to be spend in college which Rachel is gonna do. \n\nShe called us both assholes and said that we are showing favoritism. She said that we are angry at her for not following out out plans for her and now we're making her kids and herself homeless in revenge. I think our decision about the money was the most logical one, but my wife is very affected by all of this and thinks Jess is right.", "created_utc": 1675173682, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10pzsvd/aita_for_giving_my_eldest_daughters_college_fund/", "score": 67, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But be honest and clear to yourself and your older daughter about it. \n\n\nThis is also not a all or nothing situation. Money is easily splitt. Your younger daughter also probably needs a basic undergrad before going into medicine? \n\n\nShe could also at least apply and try to win sholarships. \n\n\n\nTLTR: You have an adult child who is in need and you pretend you are unable to help, not actually unable.

Who's to say your daughter wouldn't want to go to college later in life after she's raised a family? Or put it towards another form of education?\n\nI think you are, maybe unconsciously, punishing your daughter for taking a similar path you did while rewarding your other daughter for making you \"proud\" with her perceived good choices.\n\nUltimately, your daughter is going through a rough time and probably saw the money as a lifeline that would help her keep your grandchildren and afford to house them while she figures things out. I notice she's never asked for it before, so is probably desperate and turning to you for help (using what she believes is money you've put to the side for her). I wonder how you told her about the money in the first place? Did you say it was hers, in a fund for her to use towards college? If so, her thinking would make sense and make YTA even more.", "For clarification: is the money in the kind of fund where there are penalties for withdrawing it for non-educational purposes? Could your eldest daughter use it now, if, say, she wanted to go to school for an associates or professional credential so she can support her kids as a single parent?", "YTA (but it's so very very close to NAH)\n\nYes, the money is yours to do with as you please.  HOWEVER, you have now gifted one child multiple thousands of dollars while your other child got absolutely nothing.\n\nThe most \"logical\" option would have been to just keep the money meant for Jess in a separate account and let it accumulate interest for awhile rather than giving Rachel a double-heaping of money (which btw, she's 17.  Plans change - just because she has plans to be a surgeon now doesn't mean that won't change)", "You have to treat children fairly. Unfortunately  that usually boils down to money. You can never give a child  a chunk of change if you can't also give the other the same chunk of change.\nIt just doesn't ever sit right.\nI imagine you worked hard for that money, blood sweat and tears, hours of work built up over time. Given to one daughter but not to another. \nUni dreams are fine, that's an investment in someone to better their lives. But you're not an entrepreneur, you're a parent.\nThe compromise here I guess would be to help your daughter now in some way shape or form while she needs it most. Spare room?", "YTA.\n\n1. Rachel is 17. She's presumably not in medical school yet. So it seems quite unlikely the money has actually been spent yet.\n2. You saved money to send Jess to college. She hasn't gone, so you haven't spent it on her education yet. But you never told her you were revoking the gift and using it for something else. Technically, it's still your money, so you can do that if that's what you truly want. You shouldn't have kept that information to yourself. Either way, rescinding a gift is an AH thing to do.\n3. If the \"college fund\" is in a tax-advantaged vehicle like a 529 account, there could be income tax and penalties to pay if you withdraw earnings for non-education purposes. That's a good reason to say \"no\" to giving Jess the entire amount. But you can withdraw your original contributions without any taxes or penalties. IMO, the least you should do for Jess is withdraw your original contributions and give them to her. Then let Rachel spend the earnings on her education. Or wait and see if Jess goes back to school. Being a SAHM certainly didn't work out the way she had hoped.\n4. Your 17 year-old is saying she wants to go to med school. She has to get a bachelors degree first, and she might change her mind over the next four or five years. She might decide she hates chemistry. Or working long hours. Or a million other things. You taking her aspirations at face value comes across as blatant favoritism. I can understand why Jess would accuse you of that.", "YTA  \nThis was her college fund that you promised her. People go to school at all times in their life. It should have been put aside until she needed it (not for rent imho).", "YTA. They should\u2019ve been separate accounts. She\u2019s only 25 she could still end up going to college or any other type of secondary education program. Because she didn\u2019t follow a typical education path she doesn\u2019t get the benefit? An 18 year old told you she didn\u2019t want to go to college and get married and your immediate thought was well that\u2019s a forever decision? In the end you\u2019re right, it is your money and you can do whatever you want with it but being right doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not an asshole.", "YTA. I think you\u2019re right that it is your money and such but it was still kind of a jerk move to give it to the younger sister. My parents did the same thing for my sister and I they had 2 college funds. My sister went to college and they used the money to help her, I skipped college so instead my parents used the money to help me with a down payment on a house. Their logic was its a \u201ccollege fund\u201d but ultimately its money they wanted to invest in my future. Im 35 now and even without college I\u2019ve found a good career and thanks to owning a house at age 21 I\u2019m more financially stable than most of my college educated friends.

The plan we chose would return the principal, but keep the interest, and return the government grant money in the case that the kid chose not to pursue post secondary.

Your parents did the right thing, you were aware of what the money is meant for and you made your own decision not to use this opportunity. Good for you but you are entitled to nothing.", "With most of these funds there is a substantial penalty for using the funds for anything not education related.", "\"Take the money from Rachel's education\"\n\n....the extra money that Rachel wouldn't even have if Jess hadn't passed on going to college.", "that\u2019s good, you\u2019d have a much bigger problem if she wasn\u2019t a realist.\n\nIn my modest (aggressively middle class) financial position I would offer to pay the Security deposit on a rental that she could afford. (you\u2019d likely get that money back at the end of the lease, but if you don\u2019t you may just have to accept the loss or assume it is a gift)\n\nAs far as what money she has access to and has rights to use is more messy, for that you need an attorney. Reasonable people would be willing to talk about the finances and agree on short term plans, but divorce is often past the point of reason.\n\nIt is unlikely that she should be on the street unless they were financially irresponsible or already poor.", "Yes all of these things costs money and she should be helped if possible. However, it should be noted that the parents do not appear to be wealthy enough to afford that. We don\u2019t know the amount in the college fund either I am imagining it is in the 5-20k range, which will help short term, but not long term. Based on the mother\u2019s wording, the daughter is likely under the delusion that she will still be able to stay at home and have her lifestyle paid for. This is very unlikely to happen.\n\nThe daughter coming to collect the college fund and feeling entitled to it is not in the right. The children can still live with the father if she cannot provide housing. I am sure the grandmother won\u2019t truely let her grandchildren become homeless.", "Honestly, I think this is the best option. She would go through the money super fast and have nothing to show for it. \n\nYour youngest is just starting college though, that means the majority of the money is still there. You should tell your oldest that the offer still stands for you to pay for an associates degree. She will definitely need some way to support herself and the children.", ">\"I can't hold on to the money forever!\"\n\nIt has been 5 years - which is a far cry from \"Forever!\"", "> I can't hold onto the money forever in case she'll change her mind\n\nWhy not?", "Then no your NTA, it was designated for a specific purpose that was denied. So long as you're willing to help your daughter in need you're doing your part.", "Wait, what?  What happened to Jess' college fund?  It's now all Rachel's? \n\nOk, look, I understand that you wanted her to go to college and she refused.  I'm painfully aware of how expensive it is here in the states and Rachel will definitely need more than you have saved for her.  \n\nDon't you think this would be the perfect opportunity to try and convince Jess to think again and consider college?  Or do you just not care anymore? \n\nPersonally I think Jess should be able to use her college fund to pay for job training which would help her in the way you wanted to help her.  Not everyone is college material.  There would still be money left to supplement Rachel's more ambitious plans.\n\nI'm not saying you should use education money for rent, but if you deny your oldest daughter any financial assistance to get her start in a career, you would be the asshole.", "You mean take back Jess\u2019s college fund from Rachel\u2019s already existing college fund right? Rachel should already have a separate fund if you were saving for both your daughters equally over the years. Or did you stop saving for Rachel when Jess decided not to go to college because you decided to give Rachel, Jess\u2019s fund?", "So quick question? How are you going to make it even between the daughters? Did you pay for the oldest wedding? How much? Do you plan to pay for the youngest wedding in addition to college?\n\nAt the end of the day, it\u2019s your money, so you can do whatever you want BUT you have to recognize that YOU created an unfair situation (college isn\u2019t for everyone and that\u2019s okay), which will eventually lead to resentment from your oldest. If you can live with that, go for it. But in reality you should have just given her the money when she was ready for the money or the very least save that money for her children\u2019s future. You created an unfair situation and ultimately you will have to live with the consequences of that decision.", "That's the right thing to do. You might need to sit down with both daughters and try to work out how to make this fair. If one daughter needs it all for college, then maybe when they get a well paid job they could give half back for the other daughter? You made a mistake and have now realised it's not fair to give all your savings to one child. Tricky", "I didn't mention helping with money, I mentioned help, I bet you're gonna be a stellar parent some day.", "One daughter is only 25. I\u2019m unaware of when you\u2019re not allowed to attend college anymore. What\u2019s the age cutoff for college attendance?", "In what country do they let you skip the basic skills and go right on to advanced knowledge?   Are you really saying that they let people (who might not have taken any kind of anatomy course in high school or whatever their equivalent of HS is) jump right into advanced anatomy, chemistry, biology, etc. courses?", "But she did pass..", "If was added to over more than 20 years and it almost sounds like it is enough to fully pay for medical school- I think it is save to assume it is more than 5k. \n\n\nThe mother matters too and i'm a little shocked that you just write of one sentence that she sounds delusiona\u00f6 and that her being in need is completly irrelavant. \n\nMoney can be split. The younger daughter is a year away from college and wont need to pay tuition for all years at once. So yes, the parents don't sound wealthy at all, but they would have the means to help daughter with deposit and first month rent. It is even fine if they don't wont to. But atleast be not dishonest about that (\" we gave that money to younger daught\" - not yet)", "7 years, which is a long time", "Why do they have to \"make it even\"? They gave both the same exact opportunity already.", "Yeah I never quite understood the point in announcing college funding to the kids, that should be one of those we'll cross that bridge when we get there kind of things.", "My children are adults who are free to make choices but they may have to face the consequences of their choices. Doesn\u2019t mean I have to bail them out if they make a shitty choice. Can they ask me for help? Yes. Will I help them? If I can. But they are not entitled to my help or my money.", "But the eldest is not using the fund yet again for its intended purpose, she wants the cash to rent a place. \n\n\nIf she wanted to pursue higher learning and they refused the fund, it'd be a different story. But as it is now, the eldest seems very entitled.", "in new zealand you have to take chemistry, biology and physics at high school to qualify for med school. and yes i'm *really* saying it.", "5 years.\n\nJess formally declined to go to college and got married at 20.  She's now 25.", "But did they have the same opportunity? OP saved for 6 years for his eldest for her fund & 14 years for his youngest + the unused balance in the older child\u2019s account. \n\nThe oldest had the option of getting a bit of funds with probably a lot of debt, while the youngest is being offered a lot more money.", "College isn\u2019t for everyone. They didn\u2019t give the same opportunity to both - he only gave the future opportunity to his youngest.\n\nThe oldest could have take that money and invested in herself through other means. College is only one type of opportunity. Some people invest in real estate that gives it to them back, some in trade school, some in their children.\n\nThat is why I am saying OP should make it even. You can\u2019t sit there and be like \u201cwell college is the only way to be successful\u201d that is not how it works. If it was, we wouldn\u2019t have people who work as software engineers with ZERO college experience making six figures, or some high school graduates being millionaires.\n\nDon\u2019t make it sound like OP gave his oldest \u201copportunity\u201d because he didn\u2019t. He wanted her to make a different choice and then punished her for it by not making it equal.", "Well, there should be something said about being able to afford to pay part, as it can affect how a HS kid approaches college choice, etc.  \n\nI knew I had to go somewhere where I got a lot of financial aid, or have a lot of debt, bc i knew how much money there wasn\u2019t; I tell my kids they can go anywhere they can get into w/o regard to the cost\u2014which isn\u2019t perfectly true, but is close enough.", "Again, nobody mentioned money boomer, move on.", "No she doesn\u2019t. She\u2019s hit a financial hardship and knew there was money that had been saved for her. They\u2019re her parents not a bank she assumed that they\u2019d let her use money saved for her while her life was falling apart. Also, they didn\u2019t say no it\u2019s for college, they said no we gave it to your sister whose still in high school. They could\u2019ve just as easy said you can stay with us and that money is yours if you attended an secondary education program whether it be college or cosmetology school or a trade school, but no, it\u2019s you didnt do as we said so we gave it away to someone who may not need it."]}
