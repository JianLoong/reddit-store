But I have a POS Sunfire that I keep for grocery shopping or really bad weather. \n\nI was out doing my groceries and when I came home there was someone parked in my driveway.  It's really not that big a deal to me. So I parked behind them and brought my stuff into the house.  I watched a hockey game.  Then a friend invited me over.  \n\nAnd I completely spaced. I went to my garage that faces my alley not the driveway in front of my mouse.  And I took off on my motorcycle.  The next day I got home around noon.  When I checked my mail I saw notes in my mailbox and on my car.  I had trapped some poor guy in my driveway.  I honestly felt bad about it.  I moved my car onto the street.  \n\nUntil my neighbor came over to yell at me for trapping her daughter's boyfriend on my driveway.  I apologized and mentioned that I had been home for nearly four hours before I left and they could have asked me to move at any time and I would have.  \n\nShe said she saw me come home but didn't want to bother me until it was time for him to leave.  And when they came around ten at night I wasn't home. And they don't have my number.  \n\nI apologized again but now I feel kind of stupid because they were parked on my property.
