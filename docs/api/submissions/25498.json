It was about a 30-40 min. drive back to my Gfs house and we were going through a 20 min stretch where there is nothing other then some miscellaneous houses. When my Gf best friend (we\u2019ll call her sarah) made a comment about how I should\u2019ve paid for her since I recently inherited money from my mother who died 2 weeks prior when a drunk driver hit her. \nMe and Sarah have always bumped heads in the past and she\u2019s always made crude comments and such to me, but I\u2019ve never been the sensitive type. I calmly responded that \u201cshe wasn\u2019t my Gf meaning she wasn\u2019t my responsibility, and to please not talk about my Mom\u201d (As it\u2019s still a sore subject). \nA couple min. of silence goes by and she starts talking about her own mom to my Gf. Idk if she did this to patronize me or not, but I still didn\u2019t want to hear about it. I tried to give my Gf a look to say to change the topic, but she didn\u2019t get the message. I then turn to look at Sarah and told her to change the subject She was in the backseat, and while doing this I didn\u2019t realize I veered into the opposing lane, and almost hit another car.\nAfter this Sarah exclaimed \u201cWatch the road, we\u2019re not trying to die the same way your Mom did.\u201d My Gf started yelling at Sarah for making the comment as she tried to defend herself saying it was a joke. During this I pulled over, they asked what I was doing, and I began to yell at Sarah to get out of my car, at first she refused, but eventually she listened. I drove off leaving her behind. My Gf started to yell at me to turn around and said \u201cjust because she hurt your feelings doesn\u2019t mean you leave her stranded.\u201d I didn\u2019t turn around, and now my Gf is pissed at what I did. \nThat was a week ago and I still feel I was justified in what I did, but my Gf is still mad at me for it. AITAH\n\nP.S.\nSarah ended up ordering a Uber and made it home safe, just about 20 min. after us.\n\nEdit: This was around 6pm, sun doesn\u2019t set till around 7:30 around here, and my Gf was on the phone with her the whole time why she was waiting for the Uber", "created_utc": 1692991471, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1618kwi/aitah_for_kicking_my_gfs_best_friend_out_of_my/", "score": 176, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And your GF waited until the very end to even object to HER friend.\n\nYou had every right to kick this hostile person out of your car whose antagonism distracted you and nearly caused you to crash.

I know a lot of people are going to get hung up on the whole \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d thing, but she kept at it even after you spoke to her. Apart from pestering and insulting you while you were operating a motor vehicle, she\u2019s also entitled. She\u2019s not your girlfriend or family member, therefore you owe her nothing.

Sarah was a major ah, but that doesn\u2019t excuse your behavior.  Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.  Hurt feelings do not trump possible physical danger. You left a teenage girl, at night, at the side of a road, in a relatively isolated area.  That is not safe to do.\n\nI am very sorry for your loss.", "ESH except your GF.  Sarah for obvious reasons.  You for dropping her off somewhere potentially unsafe.  And you especially for turning around while you are supposed to be driving.  I would not be around Sarah any longer, and don't be surprised if your GF makes the same choice about you.", "YTA you dumped her at night alone. A 17 y/o. What were you thinking? She was way out of line; I would never be around her again for any reason. But what you did was dangerous & exposed her to harm.", "ESH but I'm going to say you are very softly TA\n\nYeah, leaving her stranded on a road wasn't the best thing to do.\n\nBut she ran her mouth off at you after being asked to STFU. Then she had the gall to make a jab at how your mother died...  I mean, FFS, it's only been 2 weeks... she is a massive AH.\n\nI would have been tempted to kick her ass out too.", "With your P.S., the fact Uber was an option where you kicked her out, NTA. \n\nLeaving her stranded and alone, YTA a bit for compromising her safety. But honestly understandable given the context \n\nNTA if you set a clear boundary that you don't want to be around Sarah anymore. NTA to refuse to pay for Sarah's anything.\n\nI'd say Sarah's TA, but heck, that's understating it!\n\nBe mindful and respect your GF's friendship though - if you expect her to stop spending time with Sarah, you will be risking being TA\n\nSorry for your loss, and sorry you've had to endure such shitty insensitive company.

And you're an asshole for (while driving) turning around, taking your eyes off the road, and veering into the oncoming lane... which could have had tragic consequences for all three people in the car, and whatever poor oncoming schmuck you wind up hitting.", "YTA,  If you had stopped at the next gas station, no problem, but leaving a young single woman in the middle of nowhere is not cool", "ESH, her comments were crude and unnecessary, but you don't strand a teen girl on the side of the road. You let her know she can never ride with you again once you've gotten her to a safe location. Or you wait with her until her Uber arrives.", "She sounds disgusting. YTA", "[removed]", "Nta. \n\nBut you are a good teacher. Sarah learned something that day for sure!", "You're good, NTAH here.", "I don\u2019t think anyone else has picked up in this, but I believe Sarah is jealous of your girlfriends relationship with you.

I would\u2019ve done the same if I was in your shoes.", "NTA, and I\u2019m so sorry for your loss. She was intentionally trying to hurt you. There\u2019s no excuse for that. You acted appropriately. It was safer to have her out of the car to not get you more upset and distracted while driving. You didn\u2019t leave her in the middle of nowhere, and she should have thought about the consequences of her own actions before intentionally saying such awful things. \n\nI would be a little upset about your girlfriend\u2019s reaction and maybe have a talk about it to see if she\u2019s worth staying with. I definitely wouldn\u2019t be anywhere near that friend again. I\u2019m guessing the friend is jealous that her bestie is in a relationship and that she\u2019s not the top priority anymore, and this was a demented way of testing your girlfriend\u2019s loyalty to her. Hope your girlfriend saw her horrible actions for what they were and distances herself from her.", "NTA...there is something wrong with that girl to say the things that she said to you. There is no way she could have thought it was an acceptable or appropriate joke. You are also in no way required to pay for her food.....especially with money that you just  inherited through an unimaginable tragedy.\nI would avoid that person at all costs. Your girlfriend should not be ok with the sense of entitlement to your money nor the horrible comments. You need to set up boundaries with your girlfriend regarding time spent with you and the friend.", "NTA lose the girlfriend and the third wheel. You deserve better.", "17 is basically grown up. She can manage 20 mins drive if she's got a phone.\n\nPulling over and removing the stressor was the safest thing to do anyway - there absolutely could have been an accident. She should thank you, but has the emotional maturity of a 3yo so that's not likely. In fact my kids were less clueless at 3.\n\nSucks to lose a parent. Sorry to hear.", "NTA. F that b.", "Sarah sucks and your GF does too. I\u2019m so sorry about your mom, and you deserve better than that GF. You\u2019re only 18, drop her, you\u2019ll find someone better.", "NTA. You should have left the GF with her.", "OK this started out as a yta but the more I read, the madder I got. \n\nHard NTA. Your GF should have shut that shit down after the first comment.", "I'm so sorry you are grieving the loss of your mother, and the  had to such endure meanness when kindness, especially from your gf, was in order.  Your gf's bestie is entitled (expecting you to pay because you inherited?!?), rude (talking about her Mom), and cruel (the comment about how your mom died was outrageously cruel).   You reached your limit in a time you were understandably not yourself(grieving takes its toll).  Seriously, how is that a \"joke\"   If your gf cannot understand this, then you may be better off without her.  Whether she is lacking maturity or compassion, it is your decision if you want to continue the relationship with someone who chooses to support her gf's inexcusable behavior rather than backing you.", "INFO: why doesn\u2019t this say ex-gf or soon to be ex-gf? \n\nNTA.", "NTA. I'm so sorry for your loss. Losing a parent is rough, of course you're still hurting. Personally, I would have nothing to do with Sarah. When you take your gf out, there's no reason to take Sarah along. After the horrible way she behaved, I wouldn't take Sarah ANYWHERE, ever.", "I\u2019m so sorry for your loss!! \n\nNTA. She was absolutely disrespectful  to you and to your mom! Jokes aren\u2019t disgusting comments that no one laughs at. If I were you, I\u2019d want nothing to do with this girl ever, no hanging out with your and your girlfriend, riding her anywhere etc. She\u2019s incredibly rude, cruel, vile, selfish and entitled!!  Show your gf the comments!", "NTA. Sarah should learn not to bite the hand that feeds her.", "NTA. Drop the GF as well. You deserve more decent persons than those two.", "NTA. There are limits to what a person has to suffer. She didnt respect you or even at the least, respect and appreciate a ride. If you had not stood your ground, she would continue to disresptect you and the reasonable boundaries that you set. Idk how you are supposed to deal with your GF. You couldn't have been together for that long considering your ages and life is short and you have a long road to go. If your GF wouldnt back you then she wont back you on something later, but likely be mad at you if you didnt  back her. The best you could have done would be to sit in the car and tell her to call an uber and wait for it to pick her up. Then no stranger danger and a lesson that she had to pay the check her mouth wrote. You will have blowback from this but you need to be strong and let it go. You set a boundary, it was crossed, you took the action to reinforce your boundary, she had to deal with triggering the situation, and if not there would not have been this opportunity to learn a life lesson. Just dont continue to argue the situation, it's over.
