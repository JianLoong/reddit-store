She kept punching repeatedly below the belt, using your dead parent as a weapon. And your GF waited until the very end to even object to HER friend.\n\nYou had every right to kick this hostile person out of your car whose antagonism distracted you and nearly caused you to crash. And honestly, once you dropped off your GF I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to see her again either. Both because of her dismissal of your grieving, and the toxic friend in her life.", "NTA. I would really consider drop the GF in she finds ok the way her friend acted and even defending her.", "NTA, clearly \"sarah\" didn't have any respect for you or for what happened to your mother. Making a comment like that is uncalled for and she was way out of line for saying that. I commend you for not tolerating someones b.s.

Always defend yourself and loved ones from malformed people like this. If you do nothing to punish the bad behaviour she will just abuse you like this forever. She now knows that fucking with you has consequences, you aren't like the other people she bullies.\n\nShe shows no respect to you, as you are doing her a favour. She's very twisted with her words.

I lost my mom 10 years ago and we were very close where I've even gone off on my friends kids after more than enough warnings.

I know a lot of people are going to get hung up on the whole \u201cmiddle of nowhere\u201d thing, but she kept at it even after you spoke to her. Apart from pestering and insulting you while you were operating a motor vehicle, she\u2019s also entitled. She\u2019s not your girlfriend or family member, therefore you owe her nothing.

If she was relying on you for a lift she shouldn't be a spiteful whatname.", "ESH... yeah she was out of line but leaving a teen girl on the side of the road, presumably at night since you were heading home from dinner, is a dick move.", "ESH -   Her comments were crude and absolutely horrible, and would warrant never seeing her again.

Sarah doesn't sound great, but yes, YTA for leaving her on the side of the road.", "YTA\n\nYes Sarah sucks BIG time.  Don't associate with her.  But to leave someone stranded at night is an AH move.

Before or during dark hours?", "Yta for leaving her stranded", "INFO: what if she hadn't made it home safe?\n\n'Cause you couldn't be sure of that when you kicked her out.\n\nTherefore YTA **for the question you asked.**\n\nOfcourse she's the leggit A$$hole here.", "Firstly, I\u2019m so so sorry for your loss! Secondly, ESH. Sarah is definitely a bitch, BUT the risk of leaving someone (especially a young woman!) deserted on the road is huge. She could have been hit by another car and injured or killed. She could have been kidnapped off the road, human trafficking is very real, and on the rise. What she said was completely out of line and I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you decide never to talk to her again. But think about this, what if she didn\u2019t make it home safe? What if, after you left her there, she got hit by car, and she suffered life altering injuries, or worse, died? What if someone snatched her off the road, and she was later found dead, or never found at all? Do you think you could live with the weight of any of those potential outcomes on your conscience? I know, it sounds like I\u2019m over reacting and that it really isn\u2019t that big. But do some digging, and you\u2019ll find that all of those potential outcomes are very very real, and they happen more often than you think. If someone is riding with you, you make sure they get home, or you make sure they\u2019re in a safe place with people that can get them home. I\u2019m so sorry about your mom, and your girlfriend\u2019s friend is a complete ahole. (Edit) even if she did have her phone, within minutes of ordering an uber, any of things I listed above could still have happened.", "ESH.  Sarah was a major ah, but that doesn\u2019t excuse your behavior.  Two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.  Hurt feelings do not trump possible physical danger. You left a teenage girl, at night, at the side of a road, in a relatively isolated area.  That is not safe to do.\n\nI am very sorry for your loss.", "ESH except your GF.  Sarah for obvious reasons.  You for dropping her off somewhere potentially unsafe.  And you especially for turning around while you are supposed to be driving.  I would not be around Sarah any longer, and don't be surprised if your GF makes the same choice about you.", "YTA you dumped her at night alone. A 17 y/o. What were you thinking? She was way out of line; I would never be around her again for any reason. But what you did was dangerous & exposed her to harm.", "ESH but I'm going to say you are very softly TA\n\nYeah, leaving her stranded on a road wasn't the best thing to do.\n\nBut she ran her mouth off at you after being asked to STFU. Then she had the gall to make a jab at how your mother died...  I mean, FFS, it's only been 2 weeks... she is a massive AH.\n\nI would have been tempted to kick her ass out too.", "With your P.S., the fact Uber was an option where you kicked her out, NTA. \n\nLeaving her stranded and alone, YTA a bit for compromising her safety. But honestly understandable given the context \n\nNTA if you set a clear boundary that you don't want to be around Sarah anymore. NTA to refuse to pay for Sarah's anything.\n\nI'd say Sarah's TA, but heck, that's understating it!\n\nBe mindful and respect your GF's friendship though - if you expect her to stop spending time with Sarah, you will be risking being TA\n\nSorry for your loss, and sorry you've had to endure such shitty insensitive company.
