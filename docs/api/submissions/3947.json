She calls or texts me most days to tell me that I need to be home at a certain time since I need to babysit my brother. Whenever she needs to go to the shop or see a friend or call someone or clean the house or cook or work, I have to look after my brother. \n\nI love my brother but it can get so exhausting looking after him. He can be very loud and energetic. I'm in the last year of college and my exams are coming up and I need to hand in my university application soon too but it's very difficult to work at home and I can't stay in school after classes since I need to walk the dog everyday (the dog needs two walks a day, I do the afternoon walk) and look after my brother. \n\nI know it must be hard being a single mother but I also know that mum receives thirty-two hours of free childcare a week and she doesn't use a single hour of it. My brother also has a dad who he sometimes stays with, but he's been looking after my brother less and less in the past two years. \n\nYesterday (Saturday), I walked the dog and then went to my boyfriend's house for the day. I let my mum know and left. However, at four o'clock, she called me to say that I needed to be home by five. She said that my brother was with his dad but he was crying and saying that he wanted to be with me instead. For probably the first time ever, I said no. I just wanted one Saturday to myself. She got angry at me and said we needed to talk later. \n\nWhen we did talk, she told me how busy she was with her new job and that she doesn't trust my brother's dad, meaning I needed to be more responsible and start doing more around the house. I just agreed. I don't like arguing. But I am angry, and sad, and stressed. I know I'm the oldest daughter and before my brother was born, I had this idea that I would be an amazing older sister and I would really enjoy looking after him but I just...don't. He can be so funny and sweet but after a few hours, all I want to do is move out and forget I ever had a brother.

Setting boundaries is hard, but it's really important. \n\nTry to spend some time thinking about what you are truly willing to do, and what you aren't. Is it a set number of hours a week? Is it at least a full day's notice? Two days a week entirely off? You would be totally justified to stop watching him completely, but it sounds to me like you don't want to do that, and also it's going to be hard to learn how to set and enforce boundaries so start a little at a time!  Tell her, mom, I love you and brother, but I can't watch him as often as you need me to. Starting now, I'm not going to watch him at all on Saturdays or for more than 2 hours a day. Don't engage with any arguments, just say that is what you need to be successful in school.  Keep repeating yourself. Then if she calls on a Saturday and tells you to watch him, leave. Remind her of what you said, and go to a friend's house during the day. \n\nIf this seems too much right now while you're a minor, I get it. You can get by as things are for a bit longer, or practice on single days. \"Mom, I have an application due next week, I can't babysit this weekend. Please find somebody else. I've helped out a lot, now I need your help. This is for my future.\" Then work on stronger boundaries once you go to uni. \n\nGood luck!!", "Really?

You need to point out to your mother that your brother is asking for you not her when he is upset. This means that you do more for him than she does and he is not your responsibility. Let her know that you are going to start backing away now so when you go away to school it will not be so hard on him. From your other replies, I know it will be hard but you have to start backing away now for both of you.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to parent your sibling. It\u2019s your mom\u2019s job. Parentification is wrong. Your dad and depressed because your mom saddled you with adult responsibilities that you\u2019re not supposed to deal with yet.", "NTA. Girl, boundaries. You're not his mom. You gotta advocate for yourself. Probably best to start thinking about a place of your own. Your mom has to parent. You didn't create a baby, she did and her son's father did. Which means they are responsible, not you. Focus on getting yourself prepared for graduating and move away.", "NTA - you are a sister not a parent", "NTA, but honey you need to stand up for yourself; you\u2019re not his mother nor should you be home all the time to watch him because mommy wants to go play.", "Get away from her. If she tries to move, change your info. Don't let yourself get sucked into an endless trap.", "NTA but your mom sure is. You didn\u2019t give birth to that child. She did. He is her responsibly and not yours. You did nothing wrong. You\u2019re an awesome big sister but that\u2019s just it. You\u2019re a sister, not a parent. Your mom is robbing you of your teenage years. Where is your dad? I hope you\u2019re able to get away from your mom attend a university where you can be a student and enjoy your life. Don\u2019t give in to your mom.", "NTA \nPlease show this to your mother. \nIf I was her, this would break my heart. \nMost adult children in this situation go no contact. \nPlease mother, do better for this child.", "NTA\n\nMake sure you apply for a college away from your mother!", "NTA. Your mother is doing this to control you. She can easily have free child care or your brother's dad, but instead of letting you have some freedom to figure out who you are and where you will go to university, she is trying to manipulate you so you won't go anywhere. Don't ever feel guilty about wanting your own life, since she has blown up her own.\n\nBTW, I was forced to be a free babysitter endlessly for all my nieces and nephews. When My kids were young and my husband died, how many actually helped me out during the worst time of my life? That's right, none. Zero. For the same reason your mother won't help you. They were only thinking of themselves, just like your mother.", ">she doesn't trust my brother's dad\n\nThen why the heck did she have a baby with him?  It's hers and his responsibility, not yours!  You don't have to do anything.  As soon as you can get out of there, do it.  She'll continue to walk all over you and not prioritize your learning and career advancement.", "I had to parent my younger brother. He was born when I was 10 1/2. My step dad worked graveyard shift and my mom worked swing shift. So I had to come straight home at the age of 12 to take care of my 2 year old brother from the time I got home from school until he went to bed. And that was after I fed him, bathed him, cleaned the entire apartment and did my homework. I was basically a free nanny/maid. And that's not to mention the verbal and physical abuse that I would get when I did something wrong.", "All of this! I second everything here! NTA for sure! \n\nSet boundaries with your mom and tell her you are at a breaking point. His dad needs to step up more. \n\nTell her your grades will be starting to suffer and that is not okay. \n\nAnd OP, do you have grandparents, aunts/uncles and any others you can talk to and/or ask for support? Start spending more time at the library and at your boyfriend\u2019s house. \n\nGood luck Op!", "The issue is that by dumping all this extra babysitting on you, she\u2019s effectively blocking you from applying to university. Next it will be \u201coh, can you wait a year before starting?\u201d or \u201cI need you to choose a university where you can live at home\u201d. You need to do everything in your power to get away so you can live your own life", "I bet that she would move so she continues to have a free babysitter. You need to get over your guilt and learn to develop a strong backbone rather than being a doormat like you currently are. \n\nThe best time to put up boundaries is now. Start studying in the library with your phone off after walking the dog every afternoon."]}
