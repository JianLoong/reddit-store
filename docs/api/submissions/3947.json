She calls or texts me most days to tell me that I need to be home at a certain time since I need to babysit my brother. Whenever she needs to go to the shop or see a friend or call someone or clean the house or cook or work, I have to look after my brother. \n\nI love my brother but it can get so exhausting looking after him. He can be very loud and energetic. I'm in the last year of college and my exams are coming up and I need to hand in my university application soon too but it's very difficult to work at home and I can't stay in school after classes since I need to walk the dog everyday (the dog needs two walks a day, I do the afternoon walk) and look after my brother. \n\nI know it must be hard being a single mother but I also know that mum receives thirty-two hours of free childcare a week and she doesn't use a single hour of it. My brother also has a dad who he sometimes stays with, but he's been looking after my brother less and less in the past two years. \n\nYesterday (Saturday), I walked the dog and then went to my boyfriend's house for the day. I let my mum know and left. However, at four o'clock, she called me to say that I needed to be home by five. She said that my brother was with his dad but he was crying and saying that he wanted to be with me instead. For probably the first time ever, I said no. I just wanted one Saturday to myself. She got angry at me and said we needed to talk later. \n\nWhen we did talk, she told me how busy she was with her new job and that she doesn't trust my brother's dad, meaning I needed to be more responsible and start doing more around the house. I just agreed. I don't like arguing. But I am angry, and sad, and stressed. I know I'm the oldest daughter and before my brother was born, I had this idea that I would be an amazing older sister and I would really enjoy looking after him but I just...don't. He can be so funny and sweet but after a few hours, all I want to do is move out and forget I ever had a brother. I feel so guilty but I just can't do this anymore.", "created_utc": 1670165100, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zcbgsr/aita_for_not_wanting_to_look_after_my_little/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That she has made you your brother's full time caretaker is out of line.  Her refusal to use available childcare is a total AH move.  It's time for you to be getting on with your life or she's going to be dragging you out of classes and exams to babysit while she walks the freaking dog!  She needs to get a stroller or something and start taking him with her when she leaves the house.

Big difference. And omg 32 hours of free childcare a week she's not using because she'd rather you be teen mom? That's rude on so many levels, I don't even know where to start. But you definitely need to start saying no. Not your child, not your responsibility.", "So she expected a 13 year old to parent a newborn?\n\nYou didn't have a choice in having a brother.

End of story. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable to tell your mom to start getting more resources lined up. I\u2019m a single mom - it\u2019s easier to leave the kid at home with someone sure, but it\u2019s her responsibility and she can be taking him out when walking the dog or running errands.", "NTA. Your mom chose to have another kid, she\u2019s TA for forcing you to act like a parent all the time. For a little perspective, at 17-18, I (and most people I know) basically got a break from any household chores because the university application process and academic load are so time-consuming. My parents were happy to do this even knowing I\u2019m the only one in the family who actually knows how to cook.", "NTA. She needs to use the childcare hours, that's ridiculous.

It is absolutely not on you to pick up the slack on this.\n\nAsk her- is it your intention to thwart my efforts to get an education and have a career of my own? I will help when I can after you use the childcare hours that are available to you. I cannot advance my own life while being at your beck and call for childcare and it is beyond unfair for you to do that to me, especially when you do have alternatives. The answer to your burdens is not to place them on me and never to look back. If your goal is to create resentment, then I would tell you that you are doing exactly the right things.\n\nINFO- Please explain the 32 hours of free daycare she it not utilizing. Highly recommend you make an edit and add that.", "NTA\r  \n\r  \nThere's a term for this, it's called Parentification - when the older sibling takes over care for the younger sibling.

You feel the way you do because you're getting burned out from looking after your brother so much. You need to be able to have a life outside of home too.  It's convenient for Mom to have he daughter be the live-in babysitter. Your little brother is more attached to you because you probably look after him more than your parents. Mom  needs to start utilizing the free childcare now before you go off to university so lil bro will be used to having someone else look after him. Single parenthood is hard, but Mom needs to figure out a way to be around the little one more.", "NTA, she chose to pop out another kid, not your job to take care of it. Honestly, time to get sneaky.

You deserve to have time to study and have a social life, but your mother is forcing you to be an unpaid babysitter.\n\nCan you demand to be paid a reasonable hourly rate for doing child care?  This might force her to use the free child care.\n\nAlso, is your father in the picture and can you go live with him?", "NTA.  You have a life and have the right to make your own choices.  Your mother had her life and the right to make her choices.  She doesn't get to use you as a tool to make dealing with the choices she's made more convenient for her.  \n\nYou have the right to say no.  There's no reason the dog needs to be walked at exactly the time you can make it directly home from school.  You could start taking an hour at the library after school each day to study or work on your university application.  The dog can survive being walked one hour later each day.  It's a small start, but I would recommend you start standing up for yourself sooner rather than later.", "NTA  Your mother had a kid, you did not.  His care is her and the Dad's responsibility, not yours. You are at a very important stage in your life and should devote yourself to that. Also, if you do take short turns at caring for your brother, you should be paid.", "Hello. I do read aita stories and post them on tt. I was wondering do you give me the permission to make your Aita post into a video?", "NTA. \n\nAnd mom is going to be in for a rude awakening when you move out, which at your age and given what is being asked of you, I\u2019d recommend you do sooner rather than later. \n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable for you to spend time on your obligations (school and studying) and your relationships (time with your boyfriend). Mom is abdicating her responsibility as the primary caregiver to you, and failing your brother. Four is old enough to start teaching him that he can\u2019t always get what he wants.", "YTA for agreeing and not being a lot more rigid previously", "NTA, at all. This situation is not fair to you. Setting boundaries is hard, but it's really important. \n\nTry to spend some time thinking about what you are truly willing to do, and what you aren't. Is it a set number of hours a week? Is it at least a full day's notice? Two days a week entirely off? You would be totally justified to stop watching him completely, but it sounds to me like you don't want to do that, and also it's going to be hard to learn how to set and enforce boundaries so start a little at a time!  Tell her, mom, I love you and brother, but I can't watch him as often as you need me to. Starting now, I'm not going to watch him at all on Saturdays or for more than 2 hours a day. Don't engage with any arguments, just say that is what you need to be successful in school.  Keep repeating yourself. Then if she calls on a Saturday and tells you to watch him, leave. Remind her of what you said, and go to a friend's house during the day. \n\nIf this seems too much right now while you're a minor, I get it. You can get by as things are for a bit longer, or practice on single days. \"Mom, I have an application due next week, I can't babysit this weekend. Please find somebody else. I've helped out a lot, now I need your help. This is for my future.\" Then work on stronger boundaries once you go to uni. \n\nGood luck!!", "Really? I feel like I'm just being given more and more since I'm almost an adult now.", "I don't really know much about it. I found an open letter on the kitchen counter one day which simply stated that my mother was eligible for thirty-two hours of free childcare (I'm guessing due to her being a single mother or our househould income or something like that). I have no idea why she doesn't use it. I've never brought it up. I know I should but I just hate any kind of confrontation so much and I feel like it would sound accusatory and rude if I did ask about it.", "I would feel a lot of guilt if I did that. When I first started to consider which university to go to, mum said she would move to the same city as me so we could still be close by. I just hope she wasn't too serious about it.", "I don't think I could bring myself to do that. Mum's been struggling with money lately. I don't know my dad.", "Thank you. A lot of people are telling me to make really drastic changes but that seems impossible to do. I still live with my mum so she controls a lot of things in my life and being blunt with her will just create tension and more stress. So thanks for your suggestions. I'm going to try and say no more often.", "knowledge is power. The first thing I would do is some research on what that is and how it works.  I do hate to tell you this, but at some point you will have to decide either to stand up for yourself or to allow yourself to be used indefinitely. Consider what your future looks like if you never stand up for yourself. Make a nice mental image of that and use it to fuel you when you make your case. (I do not want that life, I will not live like that). Do not allow yourself to be guilted. She will try to guilt you and then she will bully you. \n\nJust call it out- I'm not moved by your attempts to guilt me over something that is neither my fault, nor my responsibility. I am not giving up my life on this altar. You have alternatives, and even if you didn't- it still isn't my responsibility. Do not keep trying to make my brother into my albatross or you will absolutely ruin our relationship in a way that may not recover.", "Your future is more important than maintains shit when you\u2019re moms literally being lazy as fuck. Your brother didn\u2019t come out of your vagina- you\u2019re not the one who had a kid they can\u2019t manage. Don\u2019t be guilty that\u2019s the entire trap of parents doing this type of garbage.", "You need to move and go LC so that she doesn\u2019t move with you. Prioritize your own future and success or you will regret it, move as far as possible and make it the hardest for your mom to move with you, heck apply internationally. Don\u2019t feel bad, it\u2019s your mother who should feel bad for treating you this way.", "In that case tell her she owes you years and years of free child care when and if you have children of your own. No excuses. She OWES you.\n\nAnother thing might be to record the number of hours, and present her with a bill when her financial situation improves.", "like a mantra when she says- I do not trust his dad or I don't like this or that- just say- then you need to work that out, I cannot solve that for you."]}
