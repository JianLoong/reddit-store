I would hope a lot of people would contact her current husband.\n\nI understand this is a touchy subject and I know I mat get downvoted it for saying some of this. You have to speak up when it comes to someone being in true crisis. I get that everyone's current marital status complicates things, but what's more complicated is Melanie potentially doing something drastic that carries a lifelong impact to her and those she loves. It doesn't sound like Melanie can make healthy decisions for herself. It's very possible that her current husband doesn't know the extent to which her mental illness can lead to disaster. \n\nHer new husband might not like you chiming in, but someone has to say something. I understand people wanting to not overstep. Still, way too many people have prolonged mental health crises because too many of those around them keep their concerns to themselves. There's a delicate balance to it for sure, but airing on the side of caution is significantly better than realizing you're too late because too much damage has been done. Melanie needs professional help. I hope she gets it soon. I also hope her/your daughter gets through this crisis relatively unscathed and that enough bridges remain intact enough for her still be in the company of her friends.", "NTA, You wanted to help and tried to reach out to someone, who you thought is closest to her.

For mania, what is needed for an involuntary is evidence of disorganized and impaired judgement to the point of not being able to take care of themselves, or endangering others.  Picking fights on Facebook isn't enough, though her behavior does seem concerning.  Often, the next bit is poor sleep and impulsive spending or sexual promiscuity.  \n\nIf you still know who she sees for primary care that might be a viable path.  *They* cannot give *you* info about her, but *you can send information in*, so they can add what they know about her and take better care of her.  The staff might be surprised.   Affirm that you want to respect privacy boundaries, aren't asking questions, and write a quick note describing your concern about this new behavior with her health history and address it to her doctor.", "NTA. \n\nTheir response is awful and means your warning is going to go unheeded -- and perhaps Andrew is not the best person for her to be around if she falls back into mania?  \n\nBut nothing wrong with caring about someone's well being, especially if your daughter is involved.", "ugh NTA but I feel bad for you\n\nAndrew just doesn't know yet, you tried to do the right thing.

You tried, man.", "NTA because your intentions were good. \n\nI can see why Andrew received them poorly, though in a perfect world he'd have accepted it and realized it came from a good place not meant to be dismissive of his observations and care already in place for his wife. He may be super stressed as is and it was just the straw that broke the camel's back \ud83e\udd37 he may also think that it's not okay for him to tell her to stop or be quiet as folks have different perspectives at different times of what's best for their partner and how much to interfere. In a socially delicate situation such as this, I'd have gone to Melanie directly, or taken a different approach messaging Andrew that was more like \"hey I noticed her signs of mania peeking up again just thought I'd let you know you can let me know if you or kiddo need anything. \" it's direct, offers support, doesn't criticize his wife or if he's even noticed her behaviour, doesn't show you saying she should be told to stop, and keeps the door open for him to reach out.", "NTA\nMental illness is scary as hell because when you are objectively at your absolute worst and completely illogical, you feel fine and like everyone else is the problem. Sometimes when you're that ill you need the people around you to speak up", "NTA \u2026damn. Hopefully she won\u2019t harm herself of anybody around.", "NTA but you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped. Just let it go. You've said your piece.", "No good deed goes unpunished", "Sounds like you have every reason to be concerned, and you expressed that concern in a reasonable fashion. You're NTA.\n\nI hope that she's able to get the help she needs.", "Honestly you did the right thing. What is worrisome,  is his response!! They may feed each other's delusions, which is NOT a good place for a young child to be.\n\nIt is not your responsibility of course, but hopefully these 2 won't go off the rails when they have a child in their care. If the truly get into dangerously delusional territory,  I would consider calling CPS", "I promise you OP, that kids gonna grow up and wish you were still around. Know of this all too well. I'd just do whatever I can to let that little girl know no matter what you'll be there. Cut the rest of them off.", "NTA. i wouldve said YTA if you straight up exposed her mental illness to her husband without her consent, but... you didnt (she definitely shouldve already told him this herself, though). you went about it as respectfully as you could have, IMO", "Well you learned to stay out of her business.   I get where you were coming from, good intentions gone wrong.", "NTA but I think you needed to offer support and not advice here. Like \u201chey man are **you** ok? I\u2019m familiar with this behavior and want you to know I\u2019m here if you want to talk\u201d.", "My ex-wife's second husband reached out to me, looking I think for assurances he was not crazy.  The fact is, I had concluded she had borderline personality disorder, and there was no cure that was going to make our relationship work if she refused to acknowledge and work on it.  \n\nI blew off the opportunity to talk honestly to him, because I knew there was a high likelihood of it blowing up in my face -- and even if it did not, I knew I was better off if she stayed married and didn't want to meddle. \n\nI've felt a little badly for years for not helping a brother out.  They eventually did divorce.\n\nPoint being, OP, you're in a lose-lose situation.  Good on you for trying to do what you thought was in her best interest.", "NTA - You\u2019ve done what you can, now stay out of it for your own sanity.", "ESH: that was really poor wording in on your part.", "\u00d1TA! \nIt's a shame that your concern was met with such animosity. I suspect that soon you will be silently saying \" I tried to warn you.\"", "As someone with bipolar disorder, NTA.\n\nI remember going through phases of looking for drama. It's the high of it all. Now I am incredibly quiet on social media (besides reddit because it's anon and I like to think I don't cause any conflict).\n\nIdk exactly what mental illness she has, but if it's bipolar, BPD, or something similar, she's going to crash eventually, and the only person who will care is her husband if she doesn't leave him first. It's also not good for her kid to see her that way. \n\nIf I were you, I would maybe ask your daughter about it if you ever get to see her by herself. If you don't, go to court for some form of custody. 5 years counts for something, though you'll probably end up paying child support. If you think home life is deteriorating, call in a welfare check for your daughter.", "NTA. That being said, it sounds like he may suffer from some issues too. That poor child. My suggestion would be not to reach out again/hang out. You tried.", "NTA\n\nAndrew may come to appreciate what you did in the fullness of time. He might never thank you for it though. Unfortunately, that's how it goes when you deliver news that people don't want to hear. They get angry and defensive in reaction and only later do they see it. Try not to take it personally. You tried, and that's all you can do.", "NTA\n\nMy guess is hubs doesn't understand the diagnosis and thinks he's being loyal.\n\nThis is *always* the risk when we speak up, but, you would have a hard time living with it if you said nothing.\n\nIf you feel like you need to, you can reply publicly with love and gentleness. \"Manic depression is a tricky beast to manage. I spoke up because I care, and would hope someone would do the same for me if there was any chance my nearest support didn't yet know what they were looking at. You have my love and respect. Which is also why I mentioned it privately.\"\n\nBut also?\nIs there a chance she married someone with mental health issues and/or a tendency to enable, anyway?\nAnd do you have a plan for who should step in for the kiddo, if this goes south? (Maybe the nurse at kiddos school, to keep a soft eye on how kiddo is doing with a reason to know the home scoop, and the knowledge form who to tell if it's affecting the kid. Maybe your ex in-laws, if they are living and in good terms with the pumpkin?..\n Because that roller coaster will not be easy for the kiddo.)", "NTA\n\nAt all.", "YTA. Dude, you\u2019re her ex husband. Nothing good will come of sticking your hand in.", "I actually think it was very kind of you. Now that you've warned him, her husband should take notes at the very least.", "NTA, because of your daughter. Continuing down that path would flip you into AH territory.", "You tried bro let them go at it, they were made for each other\u2026 poor kid though that one hurts me", "NTA\n\nI would have thought the former ex now husband again would appreciate a heads up in case he doesn\u2019t do much on social media.  \n\nCertainly preferable than a welfare check request anonymously.", "Poor child. You know her teachers are super concerned that mom is trying to debate them. You did the right thing reaching out and trying to help. NTA", "No good deed goes unpunished, as the saying goes.", "NTA\n\nI suppose you could request a wellness check if there\u2019s potential for the child to come to harm or distress here. I believe those can remain anonymous but it doesn\u2019t mean that Melanie and Andrew won\u2019t deduce that you requested it. As for their social media campaign, who cares? She\u2019s apparently been making unhinged posts for a while now so any \u201cvalidation\u201d of her views on that is going to be weak because of her prior nonsense.", "Even without explaining her mental health history, I read suddenly starting shit stirring and thought \u201chypomanic\u201d\n\nBut I\u2019ve been on this rodeo circuit for a while now. Just starting out I missed a lot of hypomania symptoms until I stabilized from the true mania and could look back and reflect. Now that it\u2019s been a while, we know what to look for. Andrew\u2019s new. He\u2019s getting a trial by fire crash course that could have been avoided", "I would have contacted a family member if you were close to them.", "I love how you\u2019re the AH for making sure someone\u2019s mental health is ok or looked after. NTA you\u2019re just trying to make sure someone you care for is getting the proper mental health treatment because you\u2019ve already experienced this episode with her", "NTA and she actually did you a favor by posting a screenshot of your message. She basically told the world, \u201cMy ex husband divorced me because I act crazy and refuse to get help. He\u2019s now trying to get help for me again and instead of accepting it, I am going to continue acting crazy.\u201d", "NTA but might be time to bail on this shit show.", "NTA! She needs help and fast.", "I would say, YTA for getting yourself in this situation. Hell with her. You tried to help and she didn't want that. Now she is not your problem, she is someone else's problem. Why would you feel you need/have to intervene? \n\nAlso, the kid was your step kid, not your kid. Even if you feel some connection, she is with her mother and step father now.\n\nI don't want to be heartless, but I think it's for the best if you just leave her alone and stop worrying about her. All you can do is wish her all the best & pray for her.", "NTA, Andrew should really listen and get her some help before she escalates into DV territory.  There\u2019s a small child involved who may be in danger.", "That idiot married her twice", "NTA but not much you can do as you found out when married to her and now as her ex husband. You expressed your concern so I would leave it at that and just monitor the situation where the child is concerned  and respond as the situation dictates for her safety.", "Nta. You care, that is a good thing. Sorry they got pissy, its not your fault.", "There are matters far better not committed to writing. This is one of them. A private conversation is far better. Tone comes thru better verbally than in writing. I learned the hard way long ago that email/text is a tricky medium for delicate matters.\n\nFor all OP knows, she has access to her husband's electronics, putting him in a no win situation. And for sure, if there's no written message, there's no screen shot for her to send around.", "Completely agree", "I plan to be as involved as I can be.", "I have been looking into options for the last week in case I should need to intervene somehow for our daughter's sake. She's very happy and loves her mother very much. I don't think Melanie would be a danger to her, but I am also aware that can flip on a dime.", "Folie \u00e0 deux...well, not a real one but he is looking at the situation though her eyes, not his own.", "It\u2019s reactionary to feeling possessive/ jealous. OP knows her better than he does and having OP point it out makes it worse. At this point, leave it alone and let the chips fall where they may. If OP continues to prod that makes them the AH.", "Are you able to be in touch with the parents?\n\nI'd give them a heads up, so that they/you/SOMEONE who is already known and safe can be ready to help if kiddo gets removed. \n\nI know that's a worst case scenario, but untreated mania is not safe for kids to have to just ride out.", "Can you reach out for a wellness check? Did you legally adopt your daughter and share custody? Could you go for emergency custody? If you can\u2019t, maybe her parents can if you still know how to contact them. Maybe speak to a lawyer to see what your options are.", ">I'm mostly worried about the little daughter, she is just in the middle of the fire and that will be horrible for her mental health.\n\nThat's what terrifies me. What if she blows up the wrong person and her child is in the way or ends up close enough to witness the carnage.", "I'd agree, except that there's a kid stuck on that roller coaster ride, who deserves safety \n\nIf this continues and OP doesn't do anything, the damage to that little girl will be permanent and huge.  That's the bigger worry.", "They moved states away. Melanie and I both, together, tried to convince them to make a trip down for our daughter's birthday this year. They never responded, never even sent a card or called. \n\nI've considered reaching out but my concern is that they will only escalate things further. They have absolutely zero compassion for Melanie.", "You can still fight for rights. Not saying he'll win perse, but 5 years and the girl recognizing him as her father counts for something. \n\nMy husband got custody of our youngest despite not being her bio dad and never having married her mother. Granted, she was in his care before and during the whole court process because her mom skipped town, but emotional bonds can actually get you somewhere in court, especially if he's willing to pay child support/relieve the state of any burden the child might be on them. (Not saying she is, but the state loves to make women collect child support if they're receiving any form of benefits)"]}
