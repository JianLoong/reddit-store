The day before yesterday she posted several times and was asking people to debate with her on various subjects. Anyone who did was simply called a moron.

I would hope a lot of people would contact her current husband.\n\nI understand this is a touchy subject and I know I mat get downvoted it for saying some of this. You have to speak up when it comes to someone being in true crisis. I get that everyone's current marital status complicates things, but what's more complicated is Melanie potentially doing something drastic that carries a lifelong impact to her and those she loves. It doesn't sound like Melanie can make healthy decisions for herself. It's very possible that her current husband doesn't know the extent to which her mental illness can lead to disaster. \n\nHer new husband might not like you chiming in, but someone has to say something. I understand people wanting to not overstep. Still, way too many people have prolonged mental health crises because too many of those around them keep their concerns to themselves. There's a delicate balance to it for sure, but airing on the side of caution is significantly better than realizing you're too late because too much damage has been done. Melanie needs professional help. I hope she gets it soon. I also hope her/your daughter gets through this crisis relatively unscathed and that enough bridges remain intact enough for her still be in the company of her friends.", "NTA, You wanted to help and tried to reach out to someone, who you thought is closest to her. But maybe you are not that good friends as you thought. I guess, he maybe thinks you want to meddle with their relationship. That\u00b4s why he reacted that pissed. You did your best, but maybe he has to see it by himself how the situation with your ex wife is.", "NTA. You tried. But you can't save everyone and some people swim away from the rescue boat.", "NTA, but for now keep silent and keep watch, if only for the child\n. This is the case where time will tell, and rather soon, I'm afraid.", "You attempted to provide support for someone and did it in the most private way possible. You are not a no contact X that was spying and decided they needed your input. You saw the posts on the feed and realized that they might need some help. Now you know they do not want your help. Ignoring a mental health crisis is dangerous and if you didn't say something and someone got hurt you would have regretted staying silent.   \nNTA, Thank you for trying. The world would be a better place if we all tried to look out for each other instead of saying not my problem and walking away.", "NTA - Rest assured. You did the right thing. Either Andrew\u2019s ego is too inflated right now to accept your help or he\u2019s misdirecting his anger. Either way. You did the right thing.", "NTA - Your intentions were good. Clearly, she suffers from mental health issues and at times requires medication. You lived with her long enough to know this. Your message was not rude in the slightest. It was a gentle heads up. At this point, you know not to try to bring this up again. Be the bigger man. Don't engage. Move on and continue being kind to her and her new husband when you interact.", "Honestly it sounds like a \"damned if you do, damned if you don't\" situation. You did it with good intentions trying to help both of them, though, so I'm going to say NTA. That being said, the best thing for your own mental health would be cutting them off and letting whatever happens, happen.", "NTA, but I would just wash my hands of all of them once and for all", "NTA. No good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA mental illness is serious. I know you said her parents have cut her off, but maybe you should contact them for the sake of the child. \n\nWhen she reaches adulthood, is she going to look back and say 'living with my mother was awful and nobody did anything to help'?", "Nta.  You tried, sometimes that's all you can do.  Beyond that, live your life and don't worry about them.", "NTA...  and Andrew will realise this soon...", "nta- I think its sweet and says a lot about you that you still care enough to do that \n\nand I bet his tune will change in the future if she gets as bad as you say.

You were looking out for her and her mental health affects your child", "I don't know if I'd say YTA exactly but I think this was overstepping. You're \"friends,\" not *friends*. She didn't \"listen\" when you were her husband so I'm not sure why you thought telling her husband would do anything....he presumably sees those things too", "This specific situation is above AITA pay level.. \n\nPersonally, I don\u2019t think YTA. You did this out of concern.", "YTA (gentle). I do believe you had good intentions. \n\nInfo: have you adopted her daughter? I ask because if you are genuinely co-parenting, I can understand getting involved. If you are not, I think you probably overstepped. It\u2019s a delicate situation, but presumably Andrew isn\u2019t an idiot. He should be able to see what\u2019s happening. Im guessing he is aware of it. Unless it\u2019s a parenting issue & you\u2019re involved or intervening because you legally share a child, it does appear that you\u2019re overstepping the mark.", "YTA- this honestly no longer has anything to do with you and it is kind of creepy to be involved in your ex's life like that.  Definitely way over the line to talk to her current spouse about her like that.  There is literally nothing tying you guys together any more.", "YTA you're divorced stay out of it", "Probably wouldn\u2019t use their names\u2026", "YTA you made assumptions about Andrew and you don\u2019t know him or their relationship. You also went behind Melanie\u2019s back and that\u2019s a breach of trust . So many people with mental  illness are infantilised  and talked over about their own health and they deserve to be included in the conversation at the very least.

When they broke up I never spoke to him again or she to his children. Even though I spent three years of my early teen years with him and he was a really good father figure to me. He never has reached out to me nor I him. \n\nIt\u2019s lovely you care for her but your actions may have done more damage than good unfortunately l.", "I hear what you're saying.
