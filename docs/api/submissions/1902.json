I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that if you are able to provide for all of your children. My cousin\u2019s boyfriend is incredibly lazy (she even admits it); he does not work at all and she works three jobs. They are having a child together and he does not plan on going to work when the child is born. \n\nOn the other hand, I am pretty adamant about being child free for many reasons I won\u2019t go into detail about. My family seems to be against my choices, but at this point, I feel pretty strongly about them. I\u2019ve recently started seeing a new guy and he feels the same as I do.\n\nLast week I went to my cousin\u2019s baby shower and of course everyone was celebrating her. I kept telling her how happy I was because I am really happy for them, but personally, I do hope her boyfriend steps up a bit (I should add my family all feels the same). She said maybe one day I will be celebrating, and then she laughed and said, \u201cOh, wait. You\u2019d rather die alone than have children.\u201d I told her my intent was not to die alone, and she asked me who I planned to have care for me when I was older. I told her I was not going to have children just to force them to care for me because that\u2019s not their job. I\u2019ve always felt like that was a dangerous mindset to have.\n\nShe said she couldn\u2019t understand why I would choose not to have children and I told her it was not her decision to understand. I told her she had no right to comment on my choices because I did not comment on hers even if I didn\u2019t agree with everything she did. My cousin started crying and the baby shower abruptly ended at that point.\n\nMy aunt is pretty protective of her kids and she was upset I fought with my cousin. She said I should have just left it be and let her go off because it makes me look worse to fight back. I don\u2019t think I should have to tolerate disrespect from anybody, but it was her baby shower, and I easily could have just left it be. I feel like I could be TA here.\n\nEDIT: per the part where I hoped her boyfriend stepped up, I did not verbally tell her that. It was just something I was THINKING and I should\u2019ve made it clear I did not actually make that comment. All I told her was how happy I was for her.", "created_utc": 1668010596, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yqngt3/aita_for_telling_my_cousin_to_mind_her_business/", "score": 1022, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She kind of made this baby shower about you, when it was totally unnecessary, then got upset about it when you quite rightly told her to mind her own business.\n\nAnd she has a lot of her own business to mind! It sounds like she's going to have a lot more on her plate when the baby arrives, and who knows, maybe she secretly envies you for being able to have a life free of the stresses that having children brings, and maybe also for having a guy who supports your choice, and was trying to make herself feel better about her own questionable life choices by trying to rubbish yours.\n\nYour aunt is also wrong for wanting you to mutely accept your cousin's disrespect. So what if was her daughter's baby shower? That doesn't mean you should sit there and be insulted, especially over matters that didn't need to be brought up in the first place.

She decided to bring up an inappropriate topic at an inappropriate time and got told the truth.

Nah.", "NTA - from the post it sounds like she isn't making the best choice in who to have a baby with.

So good luck to her with that. I'm sure she'll need it. Maybe one day he'll let her quit one of her three jobs.", "Nta\n\nShe made rude comments and made things ugly, she should not have brought it up at the baby shower.

Bravo.", "Soft ESH\n\nYou aren't the asshole for saying what you did, but more so, where you said it. It was a baby shower and pregnancy hormones are no joke so it kind of makes you an asshole.

Neither one of you behaved well here.", "ESH. Her comment wasn't on, but getting into an argument with her about it, at her shower, was ridiculous.

That's why she was so easily hurt by the conversation (which was IMO not heavy handed as far as some of these interactions go).\n\nAlthough as a CF person myself (and too have no issue celebrating my friends who have children), it always confuses me why this makes such a rouse in some people. Oh, I've seen those, but at the same time in my circle (mid 30's -mid 40's) about 50% are unmarried/don't have kids and it's incredibly rare their choices even get a mention.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Responding with more cruelty simply escalates the bullshit to a higher level.", "Saying 'you'd rather die alone than do something' is not the same as saying 'you are going to die alone'. It's a hyperbolic saying.\n\nI actually agree with your position - kids or no kids, we could all end up dying alone or not alone. It's not predictable. I also agree kids or no kids is a personal decision, albeit one you seem to have elected to share with family, and noone else's business. However, personally I still wouldn't start an argument at a shower like that. I'd put their comments down to ignorance and move on.

I just don't think your reaction was particularly smart.\n\nI'm 35, childfree and I can tell you now you'll likely get a lot worse. You gotta learn what battles are worth it for you; some people will genuinely be interested in your decisions and reasons, others will want to to change your mind, and some will want to dismiss you as a weirdo because someone who doesn't want what they want/have challenges them in a way they can't handle.", "I didn\u2019t say you specifically were confused.
