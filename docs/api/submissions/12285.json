Now before everyone starts getting at me for being ungrateful, hear me out. In the past, my friends have thrown me a few surprise events. When I got married, my bridesmaids insisted on throwing me a surprise bridal shower and bachelorette even though I insisted that I hate surprises. I\u2019m ok not knowing details, but I wanted to at least know the gist of what was going on. I was kept in the dark until the day of, and I was thrown a tea party - something that wouldn\u2019t even be on the top 50 things I would like to do. I felt horrible because I genuinely didn\u2019t enjoy it, but couldn\u2019t say anything because I knew how expensive the venue was. I was grateful that they planned it, so I thanked them and just reminded them that I\u2019m not a huge fan of surprises. Another time, they threw me a surprise picnic birthday party, because they know I love picnics. They didn\u2019t realize that the reason I love them is that I love cooking and packing the food beforehand - so I didn\u2019t get to be a part of what makes me love picnics because it was a surprise. Again, I told them I\u2019d like to not have surprises anymore. Fast forward to this year, I caught on that they were trying to plan a surprise party through my husband. Again, they chose something I really would rather not do, at least for my birthday. I had to get my husband to lead the conversation to avoid that activity, and suggest something I actually want to do. But from a bowling/arcade joint, they went ahead and reserved only the arcade without asking which I would like. And instead of splitting the birthday person\u2019s expenses equally like we do every birthday (It would have only been $3 more per person), they pressured my husband into paying my whole share. I\u2019m grateful that they\u2019re going out of their way to spend their time and money on me, but I really don\u2019t understand why they keep trying to surprise me with things without even trying to find out what I want to do. It honestly feels like everyone is wasting their time and money. I\u2019m also the only one they ever try to surprise - everyone else gets asked what they want to do.\n\nAITA for feeling this way?\n\nETA: A lot of people are saying my husband should have put his foot down, but he\u2019s honestly not that close with my friends and didn\u2019t want to cause a scene. He said more than he normally would have even in his own group of friends. In a perfect world, he would have done a lot of what the comments are saying, but he went above and beyond out of his comfort zone to steer the conversation at least to the venue I would enjoy.", "created_utc": 1678802957, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r73ym/aita_for_not_wanting_to_attend_my_own_birthday/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Honestly, both the fact that they keep planning these surprises and then do events that you don\u2019t particularly like tells me that these parties have nothing to do with you, it\u2019s all about them - either an excuse to do a particular activity or so they can feel like they are good people for throwing a surprise party (even if the guest of honor of the party doesn\u2019t enjoy what was planned).

These are your \"friends\"( don't sound like it imo). So why in the world after telling them multiple times to cut out the surprise crap, are you going along with it yet again??

I just don't get it.\n\nIt's a great way to have the party/event/whatever that the planners want, rather than what the victim wants.\n\nSee OP's comment:\n\n> but the main planner turned it down saying that not everyone would enjoy it.", "Surprise! I didn't show up.", "The reason I caught on was because he\u2019s normally not someone who plans anything ahead - and they had him try and get me to keep a time slot free for that day. We were already set to celebrate with just the two of us on the day of my actual birthday. He did tell them the original plans were something I didn\u2019t want. He suggested a few things I did want to do, but the main planner turned it down saying that not everyone would enjoy it. That\u2019s about when I caught on and he just told me what was going on. We thought me acting surprised would cause less drama than me getting upset directly with them.", "It definitely was not in passing - even for my wedding festivities, I told them I would like to know the general flow of things but they refused because it\u2019s once in a lifetime (which I thought was ironic). After both events, they explicitly asked me how I felt about them (I\u2019ve been a professional event coordinator in the past, and usually plan a lot of our group events too). I told them that because I\u2019m a planner at heart, I don\u2019t like being excluded from the planning and I would much rather know what I\u2019m looking forward to. I also mentioned that I really don\u2019t like reacting to surprises because I can usually see it coming. I\u2019m not sure if they thought \u201cchallenge accepted,\u201d but I\u2019m really the only one they throw surprises for aside from the one friend who actually loves being surprised.", "I actually did tell them both times that the events they chose weren\u2019t what I wanted to do - though I\u2019m grateful for their efforts. I just worded it nicely and said if I was asked for options, I would have suggested A B or C. I then emphasized on several occasions to please not throw any more surprises because they always talk in hindsight about how planning was a struggle.", "Wouldn\u2019t it be LESS work to just ask me what I would like to do? And just do that? Comparatively they usually spent more on the surprises than they would have on an activity I was wanting to do during those timeframes.", "I don\u2019t understand\u2026 how are the people who historically and continually do the opposite of what someone likes/wants, are not considered the AH\u2019s?

They're not planning these things for you. They're planning them for themselves and using you as an excuse.\n\nNTA for skipping.", "You need to seriously take a look at the overall behaviour of the main planner. She\u2019s not doing this for you, she\u2019s doing all of this for her. She gets all the praise for throwing the party, gets to do exactly what SHE wants, and you\u2019re left behind with a party you don\u2019t enjoy. It\u2019s actually quite a narcissistic behaviour. You need to stop playing along. Once it descends into chaos because you won\u2019t go along with it, she won\u2019t get all the praise and you\u2019ll see her true colours.", "So they've admitted these parties about more about everyone else than you.\n\nI think it's more than fine to ruffle some feathers at this point. I would send out a group text telling everyone you will not be coming. Something like:\n\"Hey guys. I heard you're all planning a surprise party for me again this year, even though I've told you all twice now I don't like them and I don't want them. While I appreciate the time and effort they take to put together, I will not be attending the party you planned for me this year. As my husband already told you, I don't like the activity you guys had planned for me and going to this party would be mean canceling plans with my husband- plans for something I actually wanted to do. I hope you all have a good time at the arcade.\"\n\nI know you don't want to cause drama, but at this point your only options are to cause some drama and stand up for yourself or keep having parties you don't want every year.", "NTA for not wanting to go, but you (or your husband) really need to make it abundantly clear that if the party is for you, it should be something you\u2019d like, otherwise you\u2019ve got plans (with your husband) and won\u2019t be attending. \n\nIt\u2019s going to be messy but tbh, it sounds like the event planner is just using your birthday as an excuse to \u201cplan a party\u201d without regard to what YOU want and that\u2019s shitty. \n\nAlso, I\u2019m sure your husband is sweet but letting the party planner steamroll it into being \u201csomething everyone would enjoy\u201d is kind of a dick move. He should\u2019ve flat out said that they could plan the party but at that point it no longer was about you and you would not be attending because it was not something that you would enjoy for your birthday.", "\u201cNot everyone would enjoy it, so we want something not everyone enjoys.\u201d \n\nIdiots.", "Don't be wishywashy.  State a blunt, bald boundary.  \"I do not like surprise parties.  If I find myself at a surprise event being thrown for me, I will leave.\"\n\nNote that this is all about you and your choices, and nothing about them and theirs.  They can throw all the surprise parties they want; you just won't be there.\n\nThey can talk about how hard it was to plan all they want; you made it clear that you wouldn't be there.  Then maybe find friends that actually value and listen to you, and want you to be happy, instead of people who treat you more like a dressup doll than a human being.\n\nAs always, I recommend reading 'When I Say No, I Feel Guilty.'"]}
