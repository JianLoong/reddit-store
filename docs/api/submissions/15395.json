In this day and age needing to find a place to live at 18 is unreasonable. A lot of 25 year olds today are still living at home because the economy is shit. YTA for telling your brother how to feel about his parents kicking him out when he was just a teen. 3 days is no time at all to find a job or anything. He could\u2019ve been guided in a way that would\u2019ve been more beneficial", ">my BF said that I'm rubbing salt in the wound, and making things worse for no reason.\n\nYes.\n\nI don't know the full story.  What I see is a kid who got kicked out of his parents home at the age of 18 for being challenging.  And with three days notice, and your parents are the ones who said to not contact them for money or to change their minds.  \n\nSo, on that count, he respected their wishes.  He's not contacting them.  Your parents are the ones who changed their minds, and he's supposed to come back full of forgiveness?  And since you think being kicked out and losing contact with your parents was the best thing that could've happened to him, he's just carrying that forward now, isn't he.  \n\nEven if I believe everything you wrote about him, he deserved better.  And you can't blame him for cutting off contact with the people who threw him out.  And, you shouldn't be surprised when he cuts contact with the person who agrees with what happened.  \n\nAnd remember how I said I don't know the full story.  You were 12 when he got thrown out.  I bet there's a lot you don't know either.  And since then?  Your parents have been feeding you whatever bullshit they tell themselves to be able to sleep at night.  \n\nYour BF is right, and YTA", "YTA\n\nYou do not know what happened as you were only 12 when it happened. you do not know the details, were not privy to everything going onat that time in his life for you to have any opinion on what he feels and ehy he feels that about your parents. Stick to your own lane and stay out of it. As of now you just got yourself kicked out of your nieces life and deservedly so.", "INFO: How long did your parents give him to find a job? Did they help him find a job? Why did he drop out? Do your parents know that it wasn't any form of depression or neurodivergence that made it hard to focus in school?\n\nEven without the answers to these questions, YTA. Legally, yes a parent and kick out someone when they are 18. I think in most of those cases, that is a pretty dickish thing to do.\n\n>So I think getting kicked out was the best thing that could've happened to him\n\nYour brother found a way to fend for himself. Good for him. Your parents DO NOT get to claim responsibility for this IN ANY WAY. He figured out how to live his life in SPITE of his parents not helping. How much further could he have gone with more support and empathy?\n\nIf you cannot see his perspective, maybe there isn't a family relationship here for you.", "YTA.\n\nIf your brother is smart, he'll just keep his parents AND his toxic sister out of  his life and the life of his kid permanently.\n\nAnd for the record, your parents didn't do anything generous for giving him a place to live until he was 18.    They did the bare minimum at best.\n\nEdit to add:\n\n\"So I think getting kicked out was the best thing that could've happened to him.\"\n\nsounds no different than an abuser saying \"You're successful now, so obviously all my beatings made you a better person.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: Thanks for the awards!", "YTA.

He's allowed to hold grudges for whatever he wants, and his parents are not entitled to his time nor his own family.\n\nAlso, they didn't 'take care' of him for 18 years, they bore the responsibility of having a child for 18 years, they brought him into the world without consent, he owes them nothing for that time.

YTA and a hypocrite.", "And now, much like your parents you'll never see your brother and niece ever again and got no one but yourself to blame. \n\nYTA.\n\nEdit to add: for the record giving him 3 days after his birthday is unreasonable. You can't even find a job in that long. And in this economy? Most people still living at their parents at 30 even with a job because living expenses are ridiculous. \n\nYou were 12, I don't think you actually understand how fucked up what your parents did is. It doesn't matter that he grew up, got married, a career and a child. Your parents threw him out and said not to contact them if he needs them. He learned to live without them and you have no right to act like what they did is okay and have no right to dictate how he feels about it.

I don't know many people who had much of their shit together at 18, and of the few who did, it wasn't because their parents tossed them out on their butts. \n\nSeriously, your parents were complete assholes in their behaviour to your brother, and you're compounding the damage.

You were about 12 when this happened? There's likely an awful lot more to this than what you are aware of as you were a child at the time.\n\nInstead of A. Keeping your mouth shut, or B.

You've decided that your parents couldn't possibly be wrong and are acting like their little flying monkey, and all about something that ultimately is none of your business.\n\nYou also made the classic mistake that anyone with abusive parents will likely recognise instantly. You've attributed the success of your brother to your parents and their \"tough love.\" Rather than in spite of it. It's pathetic behaviour on your part.

You called him \"a lazy freeloading brat\". He was barely an adult legally and then got thrown out in the cold. Parents are supposed to take care of and support their children.

It sounds like you are just listening and copying the toxic stuff your parents have been saying.", "YTA\n\nI'm finding it hard to imagine that your parents kicked out a barely adult child with no idea how he'd support himself or where he'd sleep, specifically telling him not to contact them if things got bad and not only do you think it's a good thing, you yelled at him for their lack of love and concern.\n\nFamily is only meaningful if there's love and support. Why would he want his daughter around people who didn't give a fuck if he lived or died?", "Is it an American thing to kick your kids out when they turn 18? I see it a lot on reddit.

Your parents said to him to not ask to change their minds. Why should he change his mind?\n\nTurning 18 is not a marker of adulthood. He was a child who didn\u2019t know what to do and needed support, not exile. People who think kids are only their responsibility for 18 years should seriously not procreate.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if your brother cuts you off and tells his kid you\u2019re dead too.", "YTA have you ever been kicked out of home, 3 days after you turned 18? Such monstrous behaviour.  He was good enough a brother to come see you, but a free loading brat when he was 17?", "YTA. Imo kicking your kid out at 18 especially only THREE DAYS after their birthday makes your parents the assholes. I understand not wanting to support your children for their entire lives but he was barely an adult. Also your parents literally told him not to contact them so idk what they thought was going to happen lol", "Your BF gives good advice. YTA.", "YTA. His experience and life are not yours. Your parents made a choice. They are living the consequences. \n\nWhat you feel and think about his relationship with your parents doesn\u2019t really matter, as he has every right to choose they are no longer family. \n\nHe may be completely unreasonable and immature. The best part of adulthood is control over who is in your life. You sound judgmental and controlling. Being born into a family is irrelevant at adulthood for many people, as it was not a situation we would have chosen.\n\nI\u2019m glad you have a good relationship with your parents. Your brother has zero responsibility to acknowledge them.", "YTA\n\nYour family kicked him out for supposedly being a freeloader, told him never to contact them and despite all that he could pull himself together to get a job and support a family?  I don't think you or your family is on moral grounds to claim that they did any good for him.  He is well within his right hold grudges.", "YTA.\n\nHe could've been depressed, he could've been going through something, he could have a million and one reasons to struggle back then, none of which are your business. \n\nDon't get involved in other people's arguments.

And if anyone is a spoiled brat, it's you. You took him willing to involve you for granted.\n\nHis parents did him wrong. No kid at 18 is an adult, parenting responsibility doesn't magically end. We evolve in every step of the way. And a kid who's going through stuff seriously shouldn't be going through the fear of not having a safe place to stay the night, or the fear of having no food. It's a painfully traumatic experience and scars people for life. You don't necessarily know his life is better for it, he could simply be in survival mode. You don't know, and have no right so judge.", "YTA.   And so are your parents. \n\nThe US is the only country where this is normalized.  \nIt's absolutely criminal.  \nWhere did he go when they threw him out?", "YTA he was kicked out less than a week after his 18th birthday and managed to take care of himself.

Based on the age difference you were 12 when this happened and have the nerve to pretend to know what went down? When your kids are struggling through something you don't turn your back on them. Your parents suck for doing that and you suck for pretending he is where he is thanks to their shitty parenting. He's there in spite of them and you don't get to tell him when he should get over his pain. You sound just as awful as they are.

There are other way to do it like for example giving him 30 days notice and if he changes his mind and finds a job he can participate by paying some stuff around the house. He has the right to hate his parents, and if you don\u2019t like it you have the right to say away from him. \u201cDisrespecting the people who took care of him\u201d ?

How many hours do you work? How much does it pay per hour? What\u2019s your net pay after taxes are deducted? Do you have enough left to pay rent? Do you have enough left buy food? Do you have enough left for transportation costs to commute to work? Do you have enough left to buy furniture, i.e. a bed? It\u2019s obvious that you haven\u2019t thought about it. \n\nThree, let\u2019s talk about the amount of control that your parents have over you for you to even accept the sanitized and one-sided story that you were told. You were 12 when your brother was thrown out. I can imagine that you cried for him, missed him a lot, and asked your parents about him. To stop that, your parents told you something that you would accept. At 20, you\u2019re old enough to know that Santa Clause and the Easter Bunny aren\u2019t real. Honey, what your parents did was utterly messed up and you should have been taking this time to get to know your brother and asking him what happened when he got kicked out and the journey that he took to get to where he is now not defending the indefensible. Instead, you essentially started fighting and arguing that the Easter Bunny is real and that he didn\u2019t get eggs due to his own laziness. What are you doing? Why are you carrying this resentment? Where did you get it from? From how you were molded to view the situation by your parents, of course. It doesn\u2019t make sense that you haven\u2019t even started to question the stated reality. You remain that 12 year old fed a story by her parents.", "YTA.\n\nNot everyone will agree but this is my opinion. You assume that being kicked out at 18 helped him. I disagree. Young people that age need support - especially from their parents. It seems very extreme to kick your kid out just because he dropped out of high school. I can understand why he holds a lot of resentment. And you\u2019re not making the situation any better.", ">3 days is no time at all to find a job or anything. He could\u2019ve been guided in a way that would\u2019ve been more beneficial\n\nPretty sure that clock started longer than the three days they gave him. Somewhere when he had the bright idea to drop out of school up until they finally had enough of his mooching plan and gave the Ultimatum.\n\nEdit: the downvotes of entitled children mean nothing to me.", "True. The only reason I'm living in a 2-bedroom house now is because of bereavement, and I was lucky enough that the tenancy went to me afterwards. Even then I'm still getting help to pay the rent and take care of the bedroom tax by myself. I can't imagine willingly throwing an 18-year-old out in this day and age and expecting them to find somewhere and get sorted in 3 days.", "Yeah it's almost too clich\u00e9 how immature OP is.  I'm betting the parents didn't even tell her the full story truth.", "Exactly she\u2019s got narcissistic abuser tendanvies", "Those parents should have had their kids taken away by cps", ">It doesn't matter that he grew up, got married, a career and a child.\n\nIf anything he did that in spite of his parents.

I'm not saying it doesn't happen, just that it isn't \"an American thing.\"", "Yes, this.", "I'm confused cause I keep seeing this sentiment pop up. Doesn't sound like his parents intended him to have his whole life figured out, but when he chose to actively sabotage it, and then he actively refused to do the most basic adult function, get a job, then they kicked him out. Did you read it differently?", "If she is staying at home and doing school or working she is different even if she didn\u2019t pay full rent she would be different since the brother had 8 months to find a job or go into education and decided not to so he would be paying nothing", "So, just to be clear. Your brother showed signs of depression and had trouble figuring out life, then his parents kicked him out instead of helping him get treatment or helping him figure it out.\nDo you know where your brother went or what he had to do after they kicked him out?

Was he warm at night?\nHave your parents ever truly reached out to him and showed genuine remorse for kicking him out and telling him not to contact them ever again?", "Your parents sound like horrible people. I bet they didn't even try to understand what could have driven your brother's behaviour. In a previous commet you said he dropped out 8 months before he got kicked out, 8 months are not nearly enough to get your shit together, especially as a teen with parents with no empathy. \n\nI truly despise those hardass parents who think giving their kids ultimatums is a good parenting strategy. \"Once you're 18 you either work or you're out in the streets\" is just cold, it only makes people anxious, it doesn't teach responsibility. \n\nIf he had been doing nothing at all for years, and your parents had tried every alternative solution (persuasion, therapy, helping him find a job etc) then I'd see it differently, but it sounds like your parents just wanted another earner in the house, and when that became more difficult than they expected they just decided they couldn't be bothered. \n\nThey're assholes, and YTA for supporting their cruelty.", "So he had consequences for his actions and your parents were happy with that so how they have to deal with the consequences of their own actions don\u2019t they otherwise they would be massive hypocrites wouldn\u2019t they?", "OP, just admit you suck and apologise to your brother.", "YTA\n\nAs a child who was kicked out at 18 and struggled to get where I am in my 40s let me assure you, your brother hasn\u2019t made something of himself because of your parents.

He felt abandoned by his parents. This wasn\u2019t tough love for him. It was cruelty.", "You must know a lot of helpless people. I left home at 18 and had a far better life than my home was. I know tons of people that went in to an apprenticeship or the military at 17 or 18 and did just fine.\n\nI don't have enough info for this situation to judge, but there is a huge, huge percentage of Reddit that just seems like they are helpless people who can't manage to grow up.\n\nAnd before I get attacked, which I will anyway, I have a 23 and 26 year old still at home while they save for life, whom I support and respect.\n\nBut this idea that people are still children that can't take care of themselves at 18 is enabling helpless people that don't want to accept responsibility for themselves.", "Yeah, YTA, OP.\n\nYour parents are awful people and you are enabling them and even worse, emulating them. You sound like both you and them think they didn\u2019t do anything wrong. \n\nThey did. They were shitty parents who acted especially bad in kicking him out right after his 18th birthday. They deserve everything he says about them and they deserve zero contact from him!and his family. It sounds like they have never tried to apologize to him through you. \n\nThis \u201che turned out okay so they were right\u201d bs you keep spewing is not logical or correct. Your perspective is shallow and judgmental and you might want to work on that. It sounds like he still has significant emotional trauma from being kicked out and your approach is to go over to his house, uninvited, and berate him? You\u2019re gross.\n\nYour parents don\u2019t deserve respect. They weren\u2019t right. He loves his daughter just the right amount - enough to keep her away from his toxic parents and sister.", "Or look in the mirror.", "Good parents should try to get to the root cause of why their son is behaving like this. Kicking him out should be the last resort where everything else, including therapy, has failed. These people kicked their son out 3 days after his 18th birthday, they just didn't care.", "So, he's 18. He was lost, you don't turn your back on your lost teen.", "Agreed although my hubby wasn't working much (trolley boy so onky enough for fuel and the occasional night out when able to save) or studying but still lived at home rent free until a fortnight before he turned 19, the reason my inlaws let him was because he was waiting for his intake in to the defence force. \n\nWhen we had the discussion of what we will expect for our kids moving out after 18 we agreed on that they atleast need to have a plan in motion (like hubby had), working or studying otherwise we will put them on a deadline to move out. For us, it's more knowing that they aren't lazy and sitting around all day and that they will be able to survive if anything happened to us.\n\nOP NAH from me, but only because you lacked tact and just potentially gave up the last chance your niece had at ever knowing the truth.", "They should have encouraged him into a job and told him to either get a job or punish him accordingly, aka take away video games etc. or send him therapy if that\u2019s the underlying reason. They didn\u2019t work out his underlying reason and they weren\u2019t right to kick him out", "I'm not defending them, but in another comment OP says he did nothing for 8 months after dropping out, then they told him he needed to come up with a plan in 3 days and he ignored them.\n\nOPs original post didn't have all info and was worded badly.\n\nI'm on the fence with this one. My youngest actually went to college, but after graduation did nothing for 8 months. Not even help around the house unless forced. Just played video games. We finally started charging rent from their savings and only now (a year later) are they in a final interview for a job.\n\nSo I can understand the parents pain if it was an 18 year old drop out with no plan and doing absolutely nothing for 8 months. Some people need a kick in the butt.\n\nI'm going with not enough info, because it's hard to gauge what the parents have or haven't said and done or what they offered as help and were refused before the break.", "Ouch dropping out of med school.

Dropping out of highschool means he was already lost, and instead if helping him find his way, they pulled the rug out from under him by dropping all support and telling him to figure shit out without them. And now he's figured shit out without them, and he's supposed to reconcile? You're even acting like he should be grateful because he has now found his way, but that's bs. He did that all by himself, against great hardship and against the odds, and your parents are the people who forced him into that hardship.\n\nIf I'm real honest, I wouldn't even call them his parents anymore.

For example, why conclude kicking him out worked by seeing him just living his life? What proof would you had needed that it was the wrong thing to do?

I don\u2019t regret one minute of it.", "YTA.  First, you probably don\u2019t know the full story & everything that led up to him dropping out of high school, your parents throwing him out, etc.  \n\nListening to you explain it, it sounds like you believe that they were simply trying to force him to do something with his life - not to be a \u201clazy freeloading brat\u201d - rather than just trying to rid themselves of their problem child.  It makes sense that you\u2019d believe that completely positive spin on your parents actions given that their version of events is likely the version you\u2019ve heard over the years.  \n\nHowever, you should be old enough to look at things logically rather than just believing what you\u2019ve been told.  You either haven\u2019t done that - or did & decided to believe what you wanted despite it being illogical.  \n\nLooking at the events as you stated them, it is not logical to believe that your parents motives were all positive - done out of love to keep their son from being a \u201clazy freeloading brat\u201d.  There\u2019s several reasons that that is an obvious distortion of reality at best & am outright lie at worst.  \n\nEvery adult knows that it is barely possible to afford even substandard housing - even with several people pooling resources together - at 18 years old.  Every adult also knows that it is next to impossible given 3 days notice.  That\u2019s just one of the many reasons it\u2019s not even legal to evict someone without giving them notice - usually 30 days, but sometimes as little as 3 or 10 days if there are extenuating circumstances (they\u2019re destroying your property or breaking the law on your property etc).  \n\nSo the moment he turned 18 and they were no longer legally required to parent him, they gave him 3 days to get out.  3 days.  The rock bottom minimum # of days that they would have had to give a TENANT that they weren\u2019t even related to who was also breaking the law with regards to their property somehow to legally qualify himself for such a short eviction timeframe.  \n\nAn in addition to that, they didn\u2019t tell him that they wished him the best & hoped that he\u2019d find his way, etc.  They told him not to contact them for money & or to ask them to change their minds.  So basically they said don\u2019t let the door hit you on your way out.  \n\nIt is also important to remember that while your brother is an adult now, he was literally a day out of childhood when your parents did this to him.  So while that may SEEM to you now like they were on equal footing then, it only SEEMS that way.  \n\nYou\u2019re old enough to know that not everything your parents tell you is true.  You\u2019re also old enough to know that there\u2019s two sides to every story.  And you\u2019re old enough to know that you don\u2019t know everything - even if you occasionally think you do.  \n\nYour brother obviously feels like your parents gave up on him &/or abandoned him when he still needed them.  It\u2019s also obvious that maturity has not changed his view of things.  It\u2019s even more telling that fatherhood has seemed to further validate his feelings regarding what took place.  \n\nLogically looking at your parents actions (as you described them) & how he still feels & reacts (also as you described), it seems that your parents\u2019 primary goal was to be rid of him literally as soon as they possibly could - rather than to be agents of tough love hoping to have a positive impact on him that may prevent him from being a \u201clazy freeloading brat\u201d.  There is nothing in your parents actions that logically points to any altruistic motives.  And considering that that is based on YOUR obviously bias summary of events is even more damning.  \n\nI do feel sorry for you.  You have ruined your relationship with your brother & you did so for nothing.  \n\nI do think it\u2019s the best thing for him though.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy that he be around you given your feelings & actions (statements) towards him & his trauma.", "> 3 days is no time at all to find a job or anything.\n\nBut did they give him 3 days to find a job?

The whole \"need to be out at 18\" hard and fast rule is a fucking sham.

My brother half-assed his attempts at finding a job because \"I can't work fast food,\" and at least 6 months went by before he got a job (he even sabotaged a really great job opportunity), whereas our younger sister found one shortly after graduating high school. \n\nWhen you're taken care of and not risking homlessness, I can give you a pass for fucking around and being an immature young adult. But I dropped out of college to start working when it my dad lost his job, and my brother couldn't be arsed to even pretend to care that I was struggling to keep a roof over his head.

I'm about to be 43 this year.\n\nOP is TA and needs to be be quiet. She doesn't know her brother's struggles or life. She is as bad as the parents judging.", "Had a family member who told me to not talk to them ever again. I was 20. I\u2019m 32 this year. 12 years later still don\u2019t talk to them. As much as I miss her I also know 1) I\u2019m simply doing what was asked and 2) realise how much less stressed I am. It wasn\u2019t a parent so nothing like OP\u2019s brother but I can sympathise with his emotions. There would have to be so much apologising on her part and actually listening to me for us to even attempt fixing things. I don\u2019t get how OP doesn\u2019t see that.", "Ugh that is horrible. Please though, no matter what, do not let her or anyone take that credit away from you. It was all YOU. You are amazing for being so strong.", "The last person who suggested that I should be grateful for the experiences that led to my CPTSD - for the strength and adaptability the experiences provided me - was told quite bluntly to fuck off. I was a strong, resourceful and adaptable child, and damn near all of that skill set was used to survive my experiences. \n\nAll the experiences created in my was hyper-awareness and anxiety, which I've been working on new tools for all of my adult life, peeling away the damn layers one at a time. \n\nThe wilfully ignorant can bite me.", "The sink or swim school of swimming is horrible way to learn how to swim - it could literally kill you. These parents applied the same philosophy in parenting this 18 year and they are lucky he didn\u2019t die on the streets. If I was him I\u2019d be bitter and unforgiving too.", "Thank you internet stranger this really made me tear up. I still don't take credit for my accomplishments which I'm trying to deal with because it's an EXTREME hiding and rejection of my accomplishments. This really speaks to me right now.", "Same to you. We did it.\ud83d\udc9c", "Awww I'm happy I could brighten your day a bit. I know it's something that'll take time because being able to celebrate our achievements and feel proud is something we're meant to mirror from our parents when young. But clearly yours failed you in that regard and many others. But i know you'll get there one day as you've already shown how courageous and strong you are \ud83e\udd17", "Great read. Thank you.", "Even if the parents aren't aholes, it isn't op's place to berate her brother for not wanting to see them so she definitely is", "Children are a very selfish choice someone else makes, they have no say in the decision to bring them into this world.\n\nThe people who chose to have children are responsible for caring, supporting, giving them the best tools and skills to be able to one day be independent.\n\nThat is the consequence of the decision they made and their children owe them absolutely nothing for it. It is the parents duty and responsibility to support financially, be a good examples, raise them properly and don't dare complain or blame your child for the choice you made! Let alone demand any sort of restitution for \"taking care of them\" when the whole choice was the parents' alone.\n\nIf you do a good job they will be socially responsible people and choose to take care of you in return.\n\nIf you are not ready for this, don't have children.\n\nWe need to end this thinking that parents providing for children is some favour they are doing them, and not the consequence of a choice they made!", "Sorry but YTA here. I don\u2019t know what was going on at the time, but it\u2019s highly unlikely that your brother was just being lazy. He may have been suffering from depression and quite frankly he may still be but has been left to deal with it himself. Either way, your parents made a choice. They chose to kick out their son the moment they legally could. 3 days to move out? I would hold a grudge. \n\nYou then chose to go, uninvited, to his home and lay into him. The place where he should feel safe, you invaded to tell him he was horrible. \n\nThat didn\u2019t work out well for your parents and it won\u2019t for you. \n\nIf you want a relationship with your brother and niece, try going to him and apologizing for how you acted. Stay calm, and avoid using you statements. I felt this or that. I don\u2019t want to lose my brother. I want to hear how you felt.\n\nIf I\u2019m doing the math correctly (and I hate math) you were 12ish at the time? My guess is that there was much more going on than you realize. It sounds like they treated him badly. \n\nTalk to him. More importantly, listen to him. \n\nYou never said if your parents want him back In their lives. If the answer is no, if they don\u2019t feel as if they wish they could go back and do things differently, something so they knew their granddaughter, what does that say to you about how they probably acted before they kicked him out?", "YTA your parents sound like monsters and it is so sad that they have indoctrinated you into thinking such heartless and horrible parenting is normal or remotely acceptable", "YTA. You have no idea what he went through\u2026 he was probably homeless and starving at one point", "YTA. Unless there were special circumstances (threatening physical violence, etc.) no one should ever kick anyone out with only 3 days' notice, much less their child. Add to that, they said not to communicate with them, so he did that. What are you and they upset about?\n\nThe poor kid never had a chance, but he made good on his life in spite of his upbringing. \n\nIf you think that was good parenting, I hesitate to think what you would do to your own child. Parents ought to know about karma: What they do to their children when young is what their children will do to them when old. \n\nWhat should they have done? Prepare him for the world. If he needs to leave, give him proper warning and preparation and help. Sounds like they did none of that. Personally, my kids can live with me as long has they need. My only concern is they not be able to care for themselves when I'm gone, so I would make sure they are capable no matter by that time. If they did nothing around the house, had no job, etc., there would be consequences, but those consequences don't include being kicked out with only 3 days' notice.", "YTA\n\nI guess you didn't feel like being an aunt.  So your parents need to be protected but it's all fair to kick out a 18 year old given 3 days noticed according to a 20 year old.  Your parents don't get to claim credit over what he has accomplished on his own, and you are a Major AH for acting counter to that.  He was given 3 days after his 18th birthday.  Feels like this was going to happen school or no school and a whole list of other issues that you probably weren't aware of being 12 at the time, or just omitted on your own.\n\nSounds like your niece is better off without any of you in her life.", "YTA. You were 12 when he got kicked out. You wouldn't know what else has happened to him growing up, particularly in his teens, I would say he being kicked out was a final straw with the relationship between him and your parents.\n\nFrom what you have said, you're the golden child and have absolutely no idea what has happened between your brother and parents, only what the parents have said.\n\nUnless you ask your brother his side, you won't know what his experience was.\n\nNext time you speak to your brother, I suggest having a one on one talk about what exactly happened, why he dropped out of school, and the reasons why he cut off your parents and his hate towards them.\n\nThen, you would get the 2nd side of the story, because as someone that had an extremely different history with my father to my younger sister (different mum) I can say there's more to the story.", "YTA, when you were 18 if your parents gave you three days to move out and abandoned you completely do you really think you'd be grateful and happy for it? You don't know what he went through, it takes more than 3days and no money to even secure shelter over your head, let alone food, income, security. \nJust because he was able to get his life together and things worked out for him 8 YEARS later, *without* their help doesn't mean they're to credit for his success. \n\nAlso he has a daughter, he loves his daughter and it probably cements in his mind how he would never do something so callous and uncaring to her because he loves her, but his own parents were willing to do that to him. \n\nSorry your parents never kicked you out OP so you could be as successful as your brother.", "Millennial here sick of being lumped in with Gen Z! The oldest millennials are in their mid-40s.", "So true! My brother is 12 years younger, and it is almost like we have 2 different sets of parents. He cannot understand my hatred towards MY Nparents due to the fact of him getting completely different treatment as a child, teenager, and adult. 28 still lives with \u201c my mom, my dad \u201c as he says. When I was younger I laughed at that, now I know better.", "Ageism from the little ones.", "Yeah. Not cool. I\u2019m no boomer.", "Even your avatar don't look boomer!", "Could we go back in time so you can explain this to my parents?", "I wish my parents had been like you", "That\u2019s the impression I got as well.", "I wish I could upvote this a million times! 100% SPOT ON!", "Yeah, I tell my son that I still haven't figured out what I want to do with my life and I'm 60+. We talk about work and how it was merely something to earn money so I could find out what I wanted to do...", "I was 19 when I dropped out of high school for the second time, I definitely didn't have a job or was in any way looking for one as I was dealing with a mental health crisis. My parents may have caused me a lot of trauma, and I had to lock myself in a room and pray my dad wouldn't be able to break the door down the second time I dropped out, but I was never kicked out, and because of that I at least had a roof over my head while dealing with my issues and was able to get a hs diploma (or whatever its called when you graduate by taking tests but not going to school) a few years later. YTA definitely. I was an alcoholic mess and definitely not mentally stable and my parents would still never have tossed me out. Three days? Yeah no your brother has every right to say they're dead. Also definitely feel like you should ask your brother what actually happened cos you're just parroting your parents side of the story.", "This is what I'm thinking too. I was the family scapegoat and after suffering severe abuse and escaping in my teens, my sisters still blame me for not always having things together perfectly with my emotions. They suffered some abuse too, but I was a much later child and I got the absolute brunt of it. \n\nIt sounds like brother was treated shabbily and then tossed out like trash the minute the parents thought he was no longer their responsibility. \n\nMy judgment for OP: YTA.", "I had twins at my school whose witch of a mother kicked them out the day they turned 18. Still in school and literally less than 2 months from graduation. Our school was trying to do whatever we could to keep them enrolled until graduation because they were SO close. \n\nThey're gone now. \n\nI want to know from OP how old his brother was when he dropped. I can at least understand the parents being frustrated if he dropped like a year or two before this went down and he was refusing to contribute at all. But if he dropped and immediately they dropped this ultimatum? Cruel.", "Yeah, he even let OP visit him up until she reached  18. So he most likely wasn't being unreasonable all that time. He probably even felt guilty of leaving OP behind.", "Also, a freshly kicked out kid of 18 definitely could have been a target for predators. Not saying that it happened to her brother, but if it did her saying that it was a good thing is horrific.", "And that level of disrespect for others' boundaries!", "Let's not even bother to pretend that OP cares about anything that could have happened to her brother. She doesn't care about him at all."]}
