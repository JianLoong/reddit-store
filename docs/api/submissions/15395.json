In this day and age needing to find a place to live at 18 is unreasonable. A lot of 25 year olds today are still living at home because the economy is shit. YTA for telling your brother how to feel about his parents kicking him out when he was just a teen. 3 days is no time at all to find a job or anything. He could\u2019ve been guided in a way that would\u2019ve been more beneficial", ">my BF said that I'm rubbing salt in the wound, and making things worse for no reason.\n\nYes.\n\nI don't know the full story.  What I see is a kid who got kicked out of his parents home at the age of 18 for being challenging.  And with three days notice, and your parents are the ones who said to not contact them for money or to change their minds.  \n\nSo, on that count, he respected their wishes.  He's not contacting them.  Your parents are the ones who changed their minds, and he's supposed to come back full of forgiveness?  And since you think being kicked out and losing contact with your parents was the best thing that could've happened to him, he's just carrying that forward now, isn't he.  \n\nEven if I believe everything you wrote about him, he deserved better.  And you can't blame him for cutting off contact with the people who threw him out.  And, you shouldn't be surprised when he cuts contact with the person who agrees with what happened.  \n\nAnd remember how I said I don't know the full story.  You were 12 when he got thrown out.  I bet there's a lot you don't know either.  And since then?  Your parents have been feeding you whatever bullshit they tell themselves to be able to sleep at night.  \n\nYour BF is right, and YTA", "YTA\n\nYou do not know what happened as you were only 12 when it happened. you do not know the details, were not privy to everything going onat that time in his life for you to have any opinion on what he feels and ehy he feels that about your parents. Stick to your own lane and stay out of it. As of now you just got yourself kicked out of your nieces life and deservedly so.", "INFO: How long did your parents give him to find a job? Did they help him find a job? Why did he drop out? Do your parents know that it wasn't any form of depression or neurodivergence that made it hard to focus in school?\n\nEven without the answers to these questions, YTA. Legally, yes a parent and kick out someone when they are 18. I think in most of those cases, that is a pretty dickish thing to do.\n\n>So I think getting kicked out was the best thing that could've happened to him\n\nYour brother found a way to fend for himself. Good for him. Your parents DO NOT get to claim responsibility for this IN ANY WAY. He figured out how to live his life in SPITE of his parents not helping. How much further could he have gone with more support and empathy?\n\nIf you cannot see his perspective, maybe there isn't a family relationship here for you.", "YTA.\n\nIf your brother is smart, he'll just keep his parents AND his toxic sister out of  his life and the life of his kid permanently.\n\nAnd for the record, your parents didn't do anything generous for giving him a place to live until he was 18.    They did the bare minimum at best.\n\nEdit to add:\n\n\"So I think getting kicked out was the best thing that could've happened to him.\"\n\nsounds no different than an abuser saying \"You're successful now, so obviously all my beatings made you a better person.\"", "YTA.

It's not that having children means you just don't have to care for them when they turn 18. They gave him 3 days after he turned 18???? Which 18 yo has their lives together like that. He could've ended up dead on the streets, but I guess y'all wouldn't care because his date of birth was 3 days past 18 years before. \n\nI guess enjoy life without your brother and niece, just like your parents.

He's allowed to hold grudges for whatever he wants, and his parents are not entitled to his time nor his own family.\n\nAlso, they didn't 'take care' of him for 18 years, they bore the responsibility of having a child for 18 years, they brought him into the world without consent, he owes them nothing for that time.  You're free to disagree with him, but going over there to start a scene is crossing a line.", "It is wild that you are so butthurt because you were kicked out of your brother's house while screaming at him about how he deserved to get kicked out of his parents' house. YTA and a hypocrite.", "And now, much like your parents you'll never see your brother and niece ever again and got no one but yourself to blame. \n\nYTA.\n\nEdit to add: for the record giving him 3 days after his birthday is unreasonable. You can't even find a job in that long. And in this economy? Most people still living at their parents at 30 even with a job because living expenses are ridiculous. \n\nYou were 12, I don't think you actually understand how fucked up what your parents did is. It doesn't matter that he grew up, got married, a career and a child. Your parents threw him out and said not to contact them if he needs them. He learned to live without them and you have no right to act like what they did is okay and have no right to dictate how he feels about it. They made their choice and now he's made his. \n\nYour parents need to learn to live with the consequences of their actions. Just like he had to live with the consequences of his.", "YTA. I don't know many people who had much of their shit together at 18, and of the few who did, it wasn't because their parents tossed them out on their butts. \n\nSeriously, your parents were complete assholes in their behaviour to your brother, and you're compounding the damage. Apologise for yourself, and after that tell your parents to apologise sincerely and see if there's any fence that might be mended. \n\nI'm betting not, and given your behaviour I'd venture that your brother has the lay of the land down quite well.", "So an 18 year old was a freeloading brat who deserved to be kicked out of his home with 3 days' notice, and you're ok with this? \n\nNot only that, but you think that just because he landed on his feet and has his own life, your parents must have been right to kick their kid out of his home and he should just get the hell over it. \n\nYou are a terrible sister. \n\nYour brother is allowed to hold whatever fucking grudge he wants against the parents who tossed their kid out like he was disposable.  \n\nAnd congrats on nuking your relationship with him. It was not up to you to decide what was disrespectful to your parents. They lost all right to respect when they kicked an 18 year old out of their house 3 days after his birthday and told him not to contact them for money.\n\nI hope your brother keeps on thriving without all of you in his life. \n\nYTA", "Golden child much?", "YTA. You were about 12 when this happened? There's likely an awful lot more to this than what you are aware of as you were a child at the time.\n\nInstead of A. Keeping your mouth shut, or B. Trying to get the full story before coming to any conclusion. You've decided that your parents couldn't possibly be wrong and are acting like their little flying monkey, and all about something that ultimately is none of your business.\n\nYou also made the classic mistake that anyone with abusive parents will likely recognise instantly. You've attributed the success of your brother to your parents and their \"tough love.\" Rather than in spite of it. It's pathetic behaviour on your part. If I were you, I'd work on that in particular, as you may have a family of your own one day.\n\nI hope your brother continues to thrive and dies not allow any toxicity into his family.", "YTA. You called him \"a lazy freeloading brat\". He was barely an adult legally and then got thrown out in the cold. Parents are supposed to take care of and support their children. If we focus on that the parents are supposed to support of their children at least until they're 18, your brother was \"freeloading\" exactly 3 days before being kicked out. It sounds like you are just listening and copying the toxic stuff your parents have been saying.", "YTA\n\nI'm finding it hard to imagine that your parents kicked out a barely adult child with no idea how he'd support himself or where he'd sleep, specifically telling him not to contact them if things got bad and not only do you think it's a good thing, you yelled at him for their lack of love and concern.\n\nFamily is only meaningful if there's love and support. Why would he want his daughter around people who didn't give a fuck if he lived or died?", "Is it an American thing to kick your kids out when they turn 18? I see it a lot on reddit. I think it\u2019s appalling parenting. And YTA for going along with it", "YTA - congrats on losing your brother and niece, hope defending your parents shitty decision is worth it.", " YTA, duh. Your parents said to him to not ask to change their minds. Why should he change his mind?\n\nTurning 18 is not a marker of adulthood. He was a child who didn\u2019t know what to do and needed support, not exile. People who think kids are only their responsibility for 18 years should seriously not procreate.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if your brother cuts you off and tells his kid you\u2019re dead too.", "YTA have you ever been kicked out of home, 3 days after you turned 18? Such monstrous behaviour.  He was good enough a brother to come see you, but a free loading brat when he was 17?", "YTA. Imo kicking your kid out at 18 especially only THREE DAYS after their birthday makes your parents the assholes. I understand not wanting to support your children for their entire lives but he was barely an adult. Also your parents literally told him not to contact them so idk what they thought was going to happen lol", "Your BF gives good advice. YTA.", "YTA. His experience and life are not yours. Your parents made a choice. They are living the consequences. \n\nWhat you feel and think about his relationship with your parents doesn\u2019t really matter, as he has every right to choose they are no longer family. \n\nHe may be completely unreasonable and immature. The best part of adulthood is control over who is in your life. You sound judgmental and controlling. Being born into a family is irrelevant at adulthood for many people, as it was not a situation we would have chosen.\n\nI\u2019m glad you have a good relationship with your parents. Your brother has zero responsibility to acknowledge them.", "YTA\n\nYour family kicked him out for supposedly being a freeloader, told him never to contact them and despite all that he could pull himself together to get a job and support a family?  I don't think you or your family is on moral grounds to claim that they did any good for him.  He is well within his right hold grudges.", "YTA.\n\nHe could've been depressed, he could've been going through something, he could have a million and one reasons to struggle back then, none of which are your business. \n\nDon't get involved in other people's arguments. And for god's sake don't pick a side, especially when you don't know all the details. Don't go into people's homes and accuse them of shit. You have had NO right to \"blow up on him\". And if anyone is a spoiled brat, it's you. You took him willing to involve you for granted.\n\nHis parents did him wrong. No kid at 18 is an adult, parenting responsibility doesn't magically end. We evolve in every step of the way. And a kid who's going through stuff seriously shouldn't be going through the fear of not having a safe place to stay the night, or the fear of having no food. It's a painfully traumatic experience and scars people for life. You don't necessarily know his life is better for it, he could simply be in survival mode. You don't know, and have no right so judge.", "YTA.   And so are your parents. \n\nThe US is the only country where this is normalized.  \nIt's absolutely criminal.  \nWhere did he go when they threw him out?", "YTA he was kicked out less than a week after his 18th birthday and managed to take care of himself. There's nothing lazy or ungrateful about that. Parents are supposed to take care of you. His kicked him out onto the streets. They made their bed, and they can lie in it.", "YTA\n\nYour brother was thrown out into the street with nothing and disowned for\u2026 dropping out of school and not getting a job. He\u2019s had to claw his way to where he is and that\u2019s a trauma he doesn\u2019t have to forgive them for inflicting upon him. And now, 8 years later, you\u2019re still pissing on him over it so it\u2019s not like he has reason to not be bitter. \n\nYou took sides. Hope you didn\u2019t like your niece or anything because you\u2019re now estranged too.", "YTA and you're being a horrible sister. Based on the age difference you were 12 when this happened and have the nerve to pretend to know what went down? When your kids are struggling through something you don't turn your back on them. Your parents suck for doing that and you suck for pretending he is where he is thanks to their shitty parenting. He's there in spite of them and you don't get to tell him when he should get over his pain. You sound just as awful as they are. Maybe they should've kicked you out since you think that's such a great motivator in life.", "YTA.  The grudge he's holding onto is for him to let go.

It wasn't them kicking him out that enabled him to have a family, that was all him, and the likelihood is that he would have done it whatever stance your parents took.

There are other way to do it like for example giving him 30 days notice and if he changes his mind and finds a job he can participate by paying some stuff around the house. He has the right to hate his parents, and if you don\u2019t like it you have the right to say away from him. \u201cDisrespecting the people who took care of him\u201d ?
