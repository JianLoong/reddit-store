In this day and age needing to find a place to live at 18 is unreasonable. A lot of 25 year olds today are still living at home because the economy is shit. YTA for telling your brother how to feel about his parents kicking him out when he was just a teen. 3 days is no time at all to find a job or anything. He could\u2019ve been guided in a way that would\u2019ve been more beneficial", ">my BF said that I'm rubbing salt in the wound, and making things worse for no reason.\n\nYes.\n\nI don't know the full story.  What I see is a kid who got kicked out of his parents home at the age of 18 for being challenging.  And with three days notice, and your parents are the ones who said to not contact them for money or to change their minds.  \n\nSo, on that count, he respected their wishes.  He's not contacting them.  Your parents are the ones who changed their minds, and he's supposed to come back full of forgiveness?  And since you think being kicked out and losing contact with your parents was the best thing that could've happened to him, he's just carrying that forward now, isn't he.  \n\nEven if I believe everything you wrote about him, he deserved better.  And you can't blame him for cutting off contact with the people who threw him out.  And, you shouldn't be surprised when he cuts contact with the person who agrees with what happened.  \n\nAnd remember how I said I don't know the full story.  You were 12 when he got thrown out.  I bet there's a lot you don't know either.  And since then?  Your parents have been feeding you whatever bullshit they tell themselves to be able to sleep at night.  \n\nYour BF is right, and YTA", "YTA\n\nYou do not know what happened as you were only 12 when it happened. you do not know the details, were not privy to everything going onat that time in his life for you to have any opinion on what he feels and ehy he feels that about your parents. Stick to your own lane and stay out of it. As of now you just got yourself kicked out of your nieces life and deservedly so.", "INFO: How long did your parents give him to find a job? Did they help him find a job? Why did he drop out? Do your parents know that it wasn't any form of depression or neurodivergence that made it hard to focus in school?\n\nEven without the answers to these questions, YTA. Legally, yes a parent and kick out someone when they are 18. I think in most of those cases, that is a pretty dickish thing to do.\n\n>So I think getting kicked out was the best thing that could've happened to him\n\nYour brother found a way to fend for himself. Good for him. Your parents DO NOT get to claim responsibility for this IN ANY WAY. He figured out how to live his life in SPITE of his parents not helping. How much further could he have gone with more support and empathy?\n\nIf you cannot see his perspective, maybe there isn't a family relationship here for you.", "YTA.\n\nIf your brother is smart, he'll just keep his parents AND his toxic sister out of  his life and the life of his kid permanently.\n\nAnd for the record, your parents didn't do anything generous for giving him a place to live until he was 18.    They did the bare minimum at best.\n\nEdit to add:\n\n\"So I think getting kicked out was the best thing that could've happened to him.\"\n\nsounds no different than an abuser saying \"You're successful now, so obviously all my beatings made you a better person.\"", "YTA.

It's not that having children means you just don't have to care for them when they turn 18. They gave him 3 days after he turned 18???? Which 18 yo has their lives together like that. He could've ended up dead on the streets, but I guess y'all wouldn't care because his date of birth was 3 days past 18 years before. \n\nI guess enjoy life without your brother and niece, just like your parents.

He's allowed to hold grudges for whatever he wants, and his parents are not entitled to his time nor his own family.\n\nAlso, they didn't 'take care' of him for 18 years, they bore the responsibility of having a child for 18 years, they brought him into the world without consent, he owes them nothing for that time.  You're free to disagree with him, but going over there to start a scene is crossing a line.", "It is wild that you are so butthurt because you were kicked out of your brother's house while screaming at him about how he deserved to get kicked out of his parents' house. YTA and a hypocrite.", "And now, much like your parents you'll never see your brother and niece ever again and got no one but yourself to blame. \n\nYTA.\n\nEdit to add: for the record giving him 3 days after his birthday is unreasonable. You can't even find a job in that long. And in this economy? Most people still living at their parents at 30 even with a job because living expenses are ridiculous. \n\nYou were 12, I don't think you actually understand how fucked up what your parents did is. It doesn't matter that he grew up, got married, a career and a child. Your parents threw him out and said not to contact them if he needs them. He learned to live without them and you have no right to act like what they did is okay and have no right to dictate how he feels about it. They made their choice and now he's made his. \n\nYour parents need to learn to live with the consequences of their actions. Just like he had to live with the consequences of his.", "YTA. I don't know many people who had much of their shit together at 18, and of the few who did, it wasn't because their parents tossed them out on their butts. \n\nSeriously, your parents were complete assholes in their behaviour to your brother, and you're compounding the damage. Apologise for yourself, and after that tell your parents to apologise sincerely and see if there's any fence that might be mended. \n\nI'm betting not, and given your behaviour I'd venture that your brother has the lay of the land down quite well.", "So an 18 year old was a freeloading brat who deserved to be kicked out of his home with 3 days' notice, and you're ok with this? \n\nNot only that, but you think that just because he landed on his feet and has his own life, your parents must have been right to kick their kid out of his home and he should just get the hell over it. \n\nYou are a terrible sister. \n\nYour brother is allowed to hold whatever fucking grudge he wants against the parents who tossed their kid out like he was disposable.  \n\nAnd congrats on nuking your relationship with him. It was not up to you to decide what was disrespectful to your parents. They lost all right to respect when they kicked an 18 year old out of their house 3 days after his birthday and told him not to contact them for money.\n\nI hope your brother keeps on thriving without all of you in his life. \n\nYTA", "Golden child much?", "YTA. You were about 12 when this happened? There's likely an awful lot more to this than what you are aware of as you were a child at the time.\n\nInstead of A. Keeping your mouth shut, or B. Trying to get the full story before coming to any conclusion. You've decided that your parents couldn't possibly be wrong and are acting like their little flying monkey, and all about something that ultimately is none of your business.\n\nYou also made the classic mistake that anyone with abusive parents will likely recognise instantly. You've attributed the success of your brother to your parents and their \"tough love.\" Rather than in spite of it. It's pathetic behaviour on your part. If I were you, I'd work on that in particular, as you may have a family of your own one day.\n\nI hope your brother continues to thrive and dies not allow any toxicity into his family.", "YTA. You called him \"a lazy freeloading brat\". He was barely an adult legally and then got thrown out in the cold. Parents are supposed to take care of and support their children. If we focus on that the parents are supposed to support of their children at least until they're 18, your brother was \"freeloading\" exactly 3 days before being kicked out. It sounds like you are just listening and copying the toxic stuff your parents have been saying.", "YTA\n\nI'm finding it hard to imagine that your parents kicked out a barely adult child with no idea how he'd support himself or where he'd sleep, specifically telling him not to contact them if things got bad and not only do you think it's a good thing, you yelled at him for their lack of love and concern.\n\nFamily is only meaningful if there's love and support. Why would he want his daughter around people who didn't give a fuck if he lived or died?", "Is it an American thing to kick your kids out when they turn 18? I see it a lot on reddit. I think it\u2019s appalling parenting. And YTA for going along with it", "YTA - congrats on losing your brother and niece, hope defending your parents shitty decision is worth it.", " YTA, duh. Your parents said to him to not ask to change their minds. Why should he change his mind?\n\nTurning 18 is not a marker of adulthood. He was a child who didn\u2019t know what to do and needed support, not exile. People who think kids are only their responsibility for 18 years should seriously not procreate.\n\nDon\u2019t be surprised if your brother cuts you off and tells his kid you\u2019re dead too.", "YTA have you ever been kicked out of home, 3 days after you turned 18? Such monstrous behaviour.  He was good enough a brother to come see you, but a free loading brat when he was 17?", "YTA. Imo kicking your kid out at 18 especially only THREE DAYS after their birthday makes your parents the assholes. I understand not wanting to support your children for their entire lives but he was barely an adult. Also your parents literally told him not to contact them so idk what they thought was going to happen lol", "Your BF gives good advice. YTA.", "YTA. His experience and life are not yours. Your parents made a choice. They are living the consequences. \n\nWhat you feel and think about his relationship with your parents doesn\u2019t really matter, as he has every right to choose they are no longer family. \n\nHe may be completely unreasonable and immature. The best part of adulthood is control over who is in your life. You sound judgmental and controlling. Being born into a family is irrelevant at adulthood for many people, as it was not a situation we would have chosen.\n\nI\u2019m glad you have a good relationship with your parents. Your brother has zero responsibility to acknowledge them.", "YTA\n\nYour family kicked him out for supposedly being a freeloader, told him never to contact them and despite all that he could pull himself together to get a job and support a family?  I don't think you or your family is on moral grounds to claim that they did any good for him.  He is well within his right hold grudges.", "YTA.\n\nHe could've been depressed, he could've been going through something, he could have a million and one reasons to struggle back then, none of which are your business. \n\nDon't get involved in other people's arguments. And for god's sake don't pick a side, especially when you don't know all the details. Don't go into people's homes and accuse them of shit. You have had NO right to \"blow up on him\". And if anyone is a spoiled brat, it's you. You took him willing to involve you for granted.\n\nHis parents did him wrong. No kid at 18 is an adult, parenting responsibility doesn't magically end. We evolve in every step of the way. And a kid who's going through stuff seriously shouldn't be going through the fear of not having a safe place to stay the night, or the fear of having no food. It's a painfully traumatic experience and scars people for life. You don't necessarily know his life is better for it, he could simply be in survival mode. You don't know, and have no right so judge.", "YTA.   And so are your parents. \n\nThe US is the only country where this is normalized.  \nIt's absolutely criminal.  \nWhere did he go when they threw him out?", "YTA he was kicked out less than a week after his 18th birthday and managed to take care of himself. There's nothing lazy or ungrateful about that. Parents are supposed to take care of you. His kicked him out onto the streets. They made their bed, and they can lie in it.", "YTA\n\nYour brother was thrown out into the street with nothing and disowned for\u2026 dropping out of school and not getting a job. He\u2019s had to claw his way to where he is and that\u2019s a trauma he doesn\u2019t have to forgive them for inflicting upon him. And now, 8 years later, you\u2019re still pissing on him over it so it\u2019s not like he has reason to not be bitter. \n\nYou took sides. Hope you didn\u2019t like your niece or anything because you\u2019re now estranged too.", "YTA and you're being a horrible sister. Based on the age difference you were 12 when this happened and have the nerve to pretend to know what went down? When your kids are struggling through something you don't turn your back on them. Your parents suck for doing that and you suck for pretending he is where he is thanks to their shitty parenting. He's there in spite of them and you don't get to tell him when he should get over his pain. You sound just as awful as they are. Maybe they should've kicked you out since you think that's such a great motivator in life.", "YTA.  The grudge he's holding onto is for him to let go.

You've had your parents version of events the whole time, told through their bias. \n\nAs an adult you need to learn to be more critical of people and not just blindly believe that your parents were always right, and never made a mistake.\n\nYour parents deeply hurt your brother. It wasn't them kicking him out that enabled him to have a family, that was all him, and the likelihood is that he would have done it whatever stance your parents took.

There are other way to do it like for example giving him 30 days notice and if he changes his mind and finds a job he can participate by paying some stuff around the house. He has the right to hate his parents, and if you don\u2019t like it you have the right to say away from him. \u201cDisrespecting the people who took care of him\u201d ?

Not even a week or two? Yeah, if I was your brother I would feel like my family doesn't love me, why would I want any contact with them?\n\n>\"I had enough of him disrespecting the people who took care of him\"\n\nUntil the *second* he turns 18 that is, then they want nothing to do with them.

Jeez.\n\nYTA, you need to understand that your brother was giving nearly no time or opportunity as a fresh faced 18 year old before being thrown into the world without a care - why would he have ANY need to be nice to the family that practically abandoned him?\n\nYou're free to argue with him about his life experience, but he's free to give you all the finger and live his life without toxic people who will abandon him when he needs help the most.", "YTA. 18, really?", "YTA.

So, listening to my classmates and kids who couldn\u2019t make it to college, I\u2019m grateful that my parents continued to support me beyond the time that they were legally obligated to do so. I\u2019m confused how you somehow missed all those conversations that I know has been surrounding you before college even started. You don\u2019t know *anyone* who couldn\u2019t afford to go to college, who had to drop out, or who is struggling to make it on their own? No one?\n\nTwo, your parents continue to take care of you now so you have no idea what it\u2019s like to struggle in your own. Let\u2019s just try to calculate what your brother had to do 3 days after his birthday. Do you even have a job now? How\u2019d you get it? How long did it take you to get it? How many hours do you work? How much does it pay per hour? What\u2019s your net pay after taxes are deducted? Do you have enough left to pay rent? Do you have enough left buy food? Do you have enough left for transportation costs to commute to work? Do you have enough left to buy furniture, i.e. a bed? It\u2019s obvious that you haven\u2019t thought about it. \n\nThree, let\u2019s talk about the amount of control that your parents have over you for you to even accept the sanitized and one-sided story that you were told. You were 12 when your brother was thrown out. I can imagine that you cried for him, missed him a lot, and asked your parents about him. To stop that, your parents told you something that you would accept. At 20, you\u2019re old enough to know that Santa Clause and the Easter Bunny aren\u2019t real. Honey, what your parents did was utterly messed up and you should have been taking this time to get to know your brother and asking him what happened when he got kicked out and the journey that he took to get to where he is now not defending the indefensible. Instead, you essentially started fighting and arguing that the Easter Bunny is real and that he didn\u2019t get eggs due to his own laziness. What are you doing? Why are you carrying this resentment? Where did you get it from? From how you were molded to view the situation by your parents, of course. It doesn\u2019t make sense that you haven\u2019t even started to question the stated reality. You remain that 12 year old fed a story by her parents.", "YTA.\n\nNot everyone will agree but this is my opinion. You assume that being kicked out at 18 helped him. I disagree. Young people that age need support - especially from their parents. It seems very extreme to kick your kid out just because he dropped out of high school. I can understand why he holds a lot of resentment. And you\u2019re not making the situation any better.", ">3 days is no time at all to find a job or anything. He could\u2019ve been guided in a way that would\u2019ve been more beneficial\n\nPretty sure that clock started longer than the three days they gave him.

The only reason I'm living in a 2-bedroom house now is because of bereavement, and I was lucky enough that the tenancy went to me afterwards. Even then I'm still getting help to pay the rent and take care of the bedroom tax by myself. I can't imagine willingly throwing an 18-year-old out in this day and age and expecting them to find somewhere and get sorted in 3 days.", "Yeah it's almost too clich\u00e9 how immature OP is.  I'm betting the parents didn't even tell her the full story truth.", "Exactly she\u2019s got narcissistic abuser tendanvies", "Those parents should have had their kids taken away by cps", ">It doesn't matter that he grew up, got married, a career and a child.\n\nIf anything he did that in spite of his parents.

I'm not saying it doesn't happen, just that it isn't \"an American thing.\"", "Yes, this.", "I'm confused cause I keep seeing this sentiment pop up. Doesn't sound like his parents intended him to have his whole life figured out, but when he chose to actively sabotage it, and then he actively refused to do the most basic adult function, get a job, then they kicked him out. Did you read it differently?", "If she is staying at home and doing school or working she is different even if she didn\u2019t pay full rent she would be different since the brother had 8 months to find a job or go into education and decided not to so he would be paying nothing", "So, just to be clear. Your brother showed signs of depression and had trouble figuring out life, then his parents kicked him out instead of helping him get treatment or helping him figure it out.\nDo you know where your brother went or what he had to do after they kicked him out?

Was he warm at night?\nHave your parents ever truly reached out to him and showed genuine remorse for kicking him out and telling him not to contact them ever again?", "Your parents sound like horrible people. I bet they didn't even try to understand what could have driven your brother's behaviour. In a previous commet you said he dropped out 8 months before he got kicked out, 8 months are not nearly enough to get your shit together, especially as a teen with parents with no empathy. \n\nI truly despise those hardass parents who think giving their kids ultimatums is a good parenting strategy. \"Once you're 18 you either work or you're out in the streets\" is just cold, it only makes people anxious, it doesn't teach responsibility. \n\nIf he had been doing nothing at all for years, and your parents had tried every alternative solution (persuasion, therapy, helping him find a job etc) then I'd see it differently, but it sounds like your parents just wanted another earner in the house, and when that became more difficult than they expected they just decided they couldn't be bothered. \n\nThey're assholes, and YTA for supporting their cruelty.", "So he had consequences for his actions and your parents were happy with that so how they have to deal with the consequences of their own actions don\u2019t they otherwise they would be massive hypocrites wouldn\u2019t they?", "OP, just admit you suck and apologise to your brother.", "YTA\n\nAs a child who was kicked out at 18 and struggled to get where I am in my 40s let me assure you, your brother hasn\u2019t made something of himself because of your parents.

It sounds like they have never tried to apologize to him through you. \n\nThis \u201che turned out okay so they were right\u201d bs you keep spewing is not logical or correct. Your perspective is shallow and judgmental and you might want to work on that. It sounds like he still has significant emotional trauma from being kicked out and your approach is to go over to his house, uninvited, and berate him? You\u2019re gross.\n\nYour parents don\u2019t deserve respect. They weren\u2019t right. He loves his daughter just the right amount - enough to keep her away from his toxic parents and sister.", "Or look in the mirror.", "Good parents should try to get to the root cause of why their son is behaving like this. Kicking him out should be the last resort where everything else, including therapy, has failed. These people kicked their son out 3 days after his 18th birthday, they just didn't care.", "So, he's 18. He was lost, you don't turn your back on your lost teen.", "Agreed although my hubby wasn't working much (trolley boy so onky enough for fuel and the occasional night out when able to save) or studying but still lived at home rent free until a fortnight before he turned 19, the reason my inlaws let him was because he was waiting for his intake in to the defence force. \n\nWhen we had the discussion of what we will expect for our kids moving out after 18 we agreed on that they atleast need to have a plan in motion (like hubby had), working or studying otherwise we will put them on a deadline to move out. For us, it's more knowing that they aren't lazy and sitting around all day and that they will be able to survive if anything happened to us.\n\nOP NAH from me, but only because you lacked tact and just potentially gave up the last chance your niece had at ever knowing the truth.", "They should have encouraged him into a job and told him to either get a job or punish him accordingly, aka take away video games etc. or send him therapy if that\u2019s the underlying reason.

My youngest actually went to college, but after graduation did nothing for 8 months. Not even help around the house unless forced. Just played video games. We finally started charging rent from their savings and only now (a year later) are they in a final interview for a job.\n\nSo I can understand the parents pain if it was an 18 year old drop out with no plan and doing absolutely nothing for 8 months.

And now he's figured shit out without them, and he's supposed to reconcile? You're even acting like he should be grateful because he has now found his way, but that's bs. He did that all by himself, against great hardship and against the odds, and your parents are the people who forced him into that hardship.\n\nIf I'm real honest, I wouldn't even call them his parents anymore.

They put him out streets. 2) Your parents aren\u2019t obligated to care for him after 18 but they don\u2019t get brownie points for feeding and providing for the life they created prior to his 18th birthday. The whole \u201cpeople who took care of him\u201d makes You sound like someone who talks without giving words any thought. For example, why conclude kicking him out worked by seeing him just living his life? What proof would you had needed that it was the wrong thing to do? Him not working or creating a family of his own? Most people do that regardless of their background. And how the fck is a 17 year old a freeloader? You\u2019re a product of your parents thinking and not even remotely trying to see his prospective. So I think it is good he extended it to you. He was put on the streets and built his life. He don\u2019t owe you or your parents anything. And that\u2019s what you refuse to get.", "There were many times in my life I asked my parents for emotional help or support and was denied.

And no, just because I'm doing ok now, doesn't mean it was best thing for me, there's a gaping hole in my heart and it hurts all the time.", "NTA your brother was an entitled lil\u2019 $h!thead who dropped out of school and refused to get a job and do something with his life. your parents probably tried everything to persuade him to do something and not just freeload, but clearly the brother was a stubborn imbecile and preferred to be kicked out of the house rather than not being a lazy-ass entitled teenager. now your brother feels entitled in his victimhood instead of seeing his part in it. you guys can\u2019t compare going back to live with the parents to save money vs freeloading. he could\u2019ve stayed at his parents\u2019 house so long he went to school or got a job. not a lot to ask! clearly $h!theads like him need the school of life to teach them things they refused to learn from their parents.

At the end of the day he's the only one who gets to make that decision (and the mother, if she's still in the picture). They're allowed to be mad about his choice - but it's still *his* choice.", "When my sister dropped out of college, our mother woke her up at 6 am to tell her to have a job by the end of the week or get out.

I don\u2019t regret one minute of it.", "YTA.  First, you probably don\u2019t know the full story & everything that led up to him dropping out of high school, your parents throwing him out, etc.  \n\nListening to you explain it, it sounds like you believe that they were simply trying to force him to do something with his life - not to be a \u201clazy freeloading brat\u201d - rather than just trying to rid themselves of their problem child.  It makes sense that you\u2019d believe that completely positive spin on your parents actions given that their version of events is likely the version you\u2019ve heard over the years.  \n\nHowever, you should be old enough to look at things logically rather than just believing what you\u2019ve been told.  You either haven\u2019t done that - or did & decided to believe what you wanted despite it being illogical.  \n\nLooking at the events as you stated them, it is not logical to believe that your parents motives were all positive - done out of love to keep their son from being a \u201clazy freeloading brat\u201d.  There\u2019s several reasons that that is an obvious distortion of reality at best & am outright lie at worst.  \n\nEvery adult knows that it is barely possible to afford even substandard housing - even with several people pooling resources together - at 18 years old.  Every adult also knows that it is next to impossible given 3 days notice.  That\u2019s just one of the many reasons it\u2019s not even legal to evict someone without giving them notice - usually 30 days, but sometimes as little as 3 or 10 days if there are extenuating circumstances (they\u2019re destroying your property or breaking the law on your property etc).  \n\nSo the moment he turned 18 and they were no longer legally required to parent him, they gave him 3 days to get out.  3 days.  The rock bottom minimum # of days that they would have had to give a TENANT that they weren\u2019t even related to who was also breaking the law with regards to their property somehow to legally qualify himself for such a short eviction timeframe.  \n\nAn in addition to that, they didn\u2019t tell him that they wished him the best & hoped that he\u2019d find his way, etc.  They told him not to contact them for money & or to ask them to change their minds.  So basically they said don\u2019t let the door hit you on your way out.  \n\nIt is also important to remember that while your brother is an adult now, he was literally a day out of childhood when your parents did this to him.  So while that may SEEM to you now like they were on equal footing then, it only SEEMS that way.  \n\nYou\u2019re old enough to know that not everything your parents tell you is true.  You\u2019re also old enough to know that there\u2019s two sides to every story.  And you\u2019re old enough to know that you don\u2019t know everything - even if you occasionally think you do.  \n\nYour brother obviously feels like your parents gave up on him &/or abandoned him when he still needed them.  It\u2019s also obvious that maturity has not changed his view of things.  It\u2019s even more telling that fatherhood has seemed to further validate his feelings regarding what took place.  \n\nLogically looking at your parents actions (as you described them) & how he still feels & reacts (also as you described), it seems that your parents\u2019 primary goal was to be rid of him literally as soon as they possibly could - rather than to be agents of tough love hoping to have a positive impact on him that may prevent him from being a \u201clazy freeloading brat\u201d.  There is nothing in your parents actions that logically points to any altruistic motives.  And considering that that is based on YOUR obviously bias summary of events is even more damning.  \n\nI do feel sorry for you.  You have ruined your relationship with your brother & you did so for nothing.  \n\nI do think it\u2019s the best thing for him though.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s healthy that he be around you given your feelings & actions (statements) towards him & his trauma.", "> 3 days is no time at all to find a job or anything.\n\nBut did they give him 3 days to find a job?

People should also understand that sometimes it takes a long while to see improvement when someone acts out.", "There are situations where having the right to do something doesn't mean you're not an asshole if you exercise that right. \n\nEven if the kid was an addict 8 months is still a very short time to make such an extreme choice, change doesn't happen overnight. I agree that parents shouldn't enable bad behaviours, and shouldn't support freeloading children indefinitely, but holy shit at least try to find alternative solutions before you decide to kick out your child.", "He dropped out of school 8 months before, 8 months sometimes is what it takes to find a good therapist. \nIf he had been behaving like this for like, three years, and they had tried everything else then it would be a different story, but it just sounds like they wanted to get rid of him for being difficult.", "OP said 8 months in a comment. It's still far too little time to make such a drastic choice. Also when people asked what other measures had his parents taken to deal with the situation, beyond the ultimatum thing, OP didn't reply, so I guess they did nothing at all, which is what makes them assholes.", "I mean, my brother refused to work or go to school after HS because he wanted to play WoW all day instead. He was just lazy and entitled. But my parents still didn't kick him out. I feel like they should have after a couple **years** of that, or at least they should have *stopped paying for his WoW subscription*, but damn give the kid some time. He eventually grew out of his lazy entitlement (finding a girlfriend made him grow up some) but I wish he'd done it a lot sooner.\n\nThese parents didn't even try to figure out if something was wrong with their kid, or try to motivate him beyond the threat of homelessness.

Sucks to suck,", "When me and my brother turned 18 we started contributing to the household bills. We weren't charged market-comparable rent (because our parents don't hate us) but we were told we'd start help paying towards the food and energy costs, even if it was just a token sum until we got a decent income of our own.", "In comments OP clarified he'd dropped out 8 months beforehand and had been warned those 8 months it was get a job or go back to school or leave but he refused, so...I'm actually on the parents side here. If you try for a year to get someone to either do school or work and they flat out refuse, there's only so much you can do about it. Once you're an adult doing that, IMO it leans into the territory of a roommate or other family member leeching on the household. You have to contribute SOMEHOW. If the kid was refusing to attend school or work no way was he doing chores.", "Tbh as long as my kids in my home they will be talked to like an adult but I will still act as a parent to them. If they want full adult life they can move out/ get a job. If not I think it\u2019s fair they live with my rules but with some leway. Aka I\u2019d let them do anything they wanted and not interfere with their lives providing they have a job and are contributing to the household as an adult, if they are acting like a child I will give them childlike punishments in order to force them to realise they need to be an adult. If they act like a child and aren\u2019t looking for a job then they will be looked after by me like a child.

And for as little a reason as they just don't want to go to school and the law giving them legal powers at a certain age that they don't need parents permission. People need to stop playing therapist when they are unqualified, just cause they don't want to deal with the most likely answer that the brother was shortsighted....\n\n>I mean hell they could've made him pay a small amount of rent for his room. Instead they kicked him out and left him to be homeless.\n\nPay how much with what money from what job? Cause according to op this was a long time in the making before the 3 day ultimatum.", "Ah yes please do tell more how the native hawaiian, with hawaiian username, has so much internalized eurocentric selfishness. Please whitesplain it to me, cause apparently the concept of being a mooch, especially to family, which is disgraceful and unacceptable behavior makes me eurocentric....", "?\n\nTell me more of these non eurocentric cultures that allow young men to sit at home and do nothing.", "Today I learned I'm apparently a man?  \n\nWhy is someone that is told repeatedly for 8 months that he needs either to be in school or have a job for others to pay for him, who refuses therapy or help, the one that gets to sit an have everyone else pay for them to play video games all day when they're a legal adult not the person that needs to change?  \n\nExplain why this stance is \"idiocy\".", "How is someone that says you can't forcefully drag a legal adult to therapy \"not emotionally responsible enough\" for kids?  \n\nAre you saying you think can physically drag people to therapy?  \n\nAre you saying it's fine for adults to have no job, no schooling, and sit at home playing video games while the other adults pay the bills ***and that be a long term plan***?", "I\u2019ve got 3 and I\u2019m 36 years old.

I hate it when people think they have to stay in the same role forever.", "I wish my parents were like you. I'm fine but you sound awesome.", "Yes, maybe all you said was true. I still disagree with kicking out your child as soon as they turn 18 if these were true, but we can disagree on that.

Nor is it my job to explain to you, as a parent, that there are a myriad of outside pressures on children, especially teens.
