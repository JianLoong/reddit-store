No... SO NTA.\n\nYour flatmate needs to understand boundaries. \n\nThen he needs to find a good therapist about his OCD and control issues.", "NTA\n\nHe needs to find a therapist.\n\nIt wouldn't help if you go along with his ever-increasing demands. Those would all be coping mechanisms and stop working pretty quickly. Next thing he wants you to wash your clothes every day, or disinfect all the surfaces in your own room every day, etc. There is no end to that. Do not go along with it. Good on you for installing a lock. I would even say that going along with wiping off your own phone twice a day is excessive. (I do agree with washing your hands when you come home from having spent time in public, and of course washing hands after using the toilet and washing hands immediately prior to preparing food are all good hygiene practices. I don't think you should have to fully clean the entire toilet after every use, although using the brush after number 2 is always polite.)\n\nIs he the owner of the place or are you both equal tenants? Might be time to talk to your landlord about this. It is not reasonable of him to make such demands as long as your room isn't growing mould on things and there's no smell coming from your room etc.\n\nIt's unreasonable if he wants to inspect your room. If he has genuine concerns about your hygiene in your own room, he can take that up with the landlord. I would pre-empt this by calling the landlord yourself IF your housemate keeps wanting to control you.", "Absolutely NTA. Using Germaphobia to force your lifestyle onto a person is very fucked up. Secondly, it is your room and assuming he is your flatmate, you are paying for the rent too, therefore it is your own room and you can do whatever you want with it. If they come up to you again, just tell them you are done and tired of their rules, and that you pay the rent equally too. If anything your flat mate is TA", "NTA. I empathize with you as I have a similar problem with a roommate. You've already gone way out of your way to be supportive and understanding and kudos to you for that! But you still need to set boundaries because for people like this, nothing you do will EVER be enough. It's a no-win situation. There will always be more ways that you are \"trying to kill them\" basically. I think you've chosen a great place to draw the line. At your bedroom door. The lock was a great measure to enforce your boundaries. I hope he can recover from this and it doesn't permanently affect your relationship, but if it does, there was nothing you could've done better.", "Is his name Sheldon?", "NTA, germaphobia is a him problem and you don't need to indulge is irrationality. Also, having indoor and outdoor clothes is not a reasonable rule.", "yeahh my fiance has ocd and germaphobia and hes never inspected his roommates rooms bc wtf? the only oddity i've ever dealt with from him was that he can't watch me clean. like imagine you were a girl or something would he still want to look in your room? anyways NTA but if it's getting this bad he needs therapy tbh", "NTA. Unless it\u2019s their home you\u2019re staying in (which you don\u2019t appear to be) you\u2019re both equally contributing and whilst it\u2019s important to be respectful when you\u2019re sharing a living space they need to be reasonable", "NTA. No one gets to inspect your room once a week, or demand you wipe your cell phone down every time you look at it. No one gets to tell you to change your clothes every time you re-enter the home either. As much as I think any roommate has to compromise and negotiate with others in a flat - your roommate is ridiculous and controlling IMO.\n\nDon't do any of the ridiculous things and if he wants the toilet scrubbed every time anyone thinks about peeing - he should do it himself.\n\nHe's trying to turn you into him. And that won't work.", "Absolutely NTA. \n\nYour flatmate needs to seek help for his issues, which are really starting to affect his life and those of others around him. I'm not sure he's temperamentally suited to housesharing.", "NTA\nOmg you live with Sheldon! Also definitely make sure your roommate never watches Big Bang Theory or he'll end up with a giant list of new rules.", "NTA. You are not responsible to help him with this issue. He is. Making you uncomfortable in your own room is not a solution and he has no right to demand it.", "NTA - He's right, you are doing nothing to help with his germaphobia. So what, that's not your job. You're his roommate not his therapist and not his co-germaphobe.", "NTA, if you gave in to all his quirks, you'd enable him.", "NTA\n\nYour flatmate is the embodiment of phrase \"if you give him an inch, he'll take a yard\". He won't stop until you stop him.", "NTA lay down a bunch of your own boundaries, and if he doesn't like it tell him to pay your fee to break the lease and move out. If he touches anything of yours without consent report it to the police and make sure you set up a camera for your room just in case. That's what I would do.", "NTA. You are already accommodating him far more than other people would, and that probably emboldened him. His condition does not trump your right to privacy. Have him get therapy.", "NTA. You should poop on the floor", "Howie Mandel has OCD about germs.    And I think that's what your flatmate may be dealing with as well.    \n\nNTA.", "WTF! NTA\nSounds like he needs professional help. You\u2019re also paying to live there and as long as you\u2019re not sloppy in the shared areas, you\u2019re in the green. Him wanting to inspect your room is out of pocket. It\u2019s your private space. You\u2019ve already been way more accommodating than most people would have been.", "NTA. \n\nEven if he had OCD diagnosis, was working on a plan, had been told by multiple professionals that looking at your room would cure him\u2026 You still don\u2019t know him that. It is unreasonable for him to expect you to let him treat you like an abusive parent would. \n\nNot to say that a parent making a kid clean up is abusive, but the sort of rules he has would be in my mind considered pretty extreme", "nta. helping with germaphobia is encouraging him to seek therapy, not letting him inspect your personal space and dictate how you treat your belongings. it would not ease his germaphobia, i dare say if you did as he asked he would add another more extreme rule before too long.", "NTA ---- Tell your roommate he needs to get therapy/psychological help with his phobia.", "NTA please tell him the following. phobias need to be overcome or at least balanced enough to live a reasonably normal life. by not giving in to his demands, you are helping him to adjust to the real world. and to stay out of your room if he likes his balls still attached to his body.", "NTA - If your roommate is that big of a germaphobe then he needs to go find a studio to live by himself.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s his job to manage his issues. I don\u2019t impose my OCD shit onto others.", "He has absolutely no say, you don't have to do anything. Germaphobe is his problem and he needs to deal with it. If he thought it would've been such an issue while living with someone he shouldn't have done it. Not your problem, I say stop doing any of his shit and I'm glad you got a lock", "NTA. You are so accommodating as it is. I would sit down with him and suggest therapy. If you a kind person you could even suggest going to the first couple of appointments with him. It seems as if he is spiraling and it\u2019s not good.", "nta woaaah first off the making you wipe down your phone is way out of bounds. secondly, he\u2019s trying to control you. his getmaphobia is his problem to deal with, not your burden to accommodate", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
