Those would all be coping mechanisms and stop working pretty quickly. Next thing he wants you to wash your clothes every day, or disinfect all the surfaces in your own room every day, etc. There is no end to that. Do not go along with it. Good on you for installing a lock. I would even say that going along with wiping off your own phone twice a day is excessive. (I do agree with washing your hands when you come home from having spent time in public, and of course washing hands after using the toilet and washing hands immediately prior to preparing food are all good hygiene practices. I don't think you should have to fully clean the entire toilet after every use, although using the brush after number 2 is always polite.)\n\nIs he the owner of the place or are you both equal tenants? Might be time to talk to your landlord about this. It is not reasonable of him to make such demands as long as your room isn't growing mould on things and there's no smell coming from your room etc.\n\nIt's unreasonable if he wants to inspect your room. If he has genuine concerns about your hygiene in your own room, he can take that up with the landlord. I would pre-empt this by calling the landlord yourself IF your housemate keeps wanting to control you.", "Absolutely NTA. Using Germaphobia to force your lifestyle onto a person is very fucked up. Secondly, it is your room and assuming he is your flatmate, you are paying for the rent too, therefore it is your own room and you can do whatever you want with it. If they come up to you again, just tell them you are done and tired of their rules, and that you pay the rent equally too. If anything your flat mate is TA", "NTA. I empathize with you as I have a similar problem with a roommate. You've already gone way out of your way to be supportive and understanding and kudos to you for that! But you still need to set boundaries because for people like this, nothing you do will EVER be enough. It's a no-win situation. There will always be more ways that you are \"trying to kill them\" basically. I think you've chosen a great place to draw the line. At your bedroom door.

It is unreasonable for him to expect you to let him treat you like an abusive parent would. \n\nNot to say that a parent making a kid clean up is abusive, but the sort of rules he has would be in my mind considered pretty extreme", "nta. helping with germaphobia is encouraging him to seek therapy, not letting him inspect your personal space and dictate how you treat your belongings. it would not ease his germaphobia, i dare say if you did as he asked he would add another more extreme rule before too long.", "NTA ---- Tell your roommate he needs to get therapy/psychological help with his phobia.", "NTA please tell him the following. phobias need to be overcome or at least balanced enough to live a reasonably normal life. by not giving in to his demands, you are helping him to adjust to the real world. and to stay out of your room if he likes his balls still attached to his body.", "NTA - If your roommate is that big of a germaphobe then he needs to go find a studio to live by himself.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s his job to manage his issues.
