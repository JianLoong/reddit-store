While I am not allowed to close my door my brother is, not just when i have friends over but when i\u2019m in there alone.

He always has to have all the control over me while my brother is free to do whatever he wants. \nToday he did something unlike any other day when i was in the shower. I struggle with a lot of mental health issues so physical hygiene is a very daunting task for me, and i also have dyed hair which he stains the shower and i have to spend hours getting it out afterwards. I really didn\u2019t want to deal with this today so i sat in the bathroom on my phone and let the water run. \nI open the door and hes starts screaming at me for not showering, he knows this because he had been laying on the ground outside the bathroom with his phone looking under the door.

Please be safe", "If this is true I would call CPS and tell them that your dad is recording you on his phone while you take a shower. (How do you know he hasn\u2019t done this before???) Also that he has glued your window shut bc he\u2019s afraid one say you might try to sneak out and you are afraid if there is a fire you can\u2019t get out. They will put you with your mom.", "#NTA.\n\nLeave immediately , that is not normal at all. **It is abuse and it is escalating** he is making sure you cannot escape or ask for help by gluing  your window( not enough is not safe for you in case of fire), he is making sure you cannot lock the door and now he is  wacthing you under the door with a mobile while you are  in the bathroom to \"make sure you showered\" wtf?! \n\n\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9 \n\nThat is creepy girl!!!  it sounds he is planning something  horrible.  Run fast to your mother and tell everything what is happening  and ask her to help you to not be with him anymore and to alert any other girl in the family to not be near him. You need to be away from him and fast. \n\nI also suggest to report to the  cops so he looses the rights  to be near to you.", "NTA, this is extremely concerning behavior. Have you told your Mom? If he doesnt agree she can go to the courts. Gluing windows shut is a fire hazard. Im so sorry you are dealing with. Playing armchair psychologist, I wonder if he is controlling you because you remind him of your Mom, which may only get worse as resentment increases after the divorce. \n\nBest of luck. Def NTA, he is.", "NTA. You Dad is controlling and creepy. Get away as soon as you can. Make sure your mum knows all that he does. Watching you in the shower, not letting you close the door. You are at risk.", "NTA. \n\nI would start documenting everything you\u2019ve said here with date, time, and description. You could also report to CPS. \n\nYou are almost an adult, and you\u2019re within your right to want to feel safe and secure in your own space. \n\nYour dad is being next level controlling and creepy.", "This is abuse not parenting. He has zero business with the phone under the door. Not being able yo close your bedroom door is also not normal.  I'd called CPS. None of it is normal behavior. Time to move to your mother's home.\n\nNTA.", "NTA - This odd, psycho behaviour. Tell your mom asap what he did, because it isn't normal.", "NTA, If he asks why you\u2019re leaving read these reasons. Who the hell glues the window shut?! That\u2019s a fire and safety hazard, and for what? To control his teenage daughter? Give me a break.", "NTA.  You're moving yesterday, right?", "NTA - invading ANYONE\u2019s privacy while they could be undressed/in a vulnerable situation is completely inappropriate. furthermore, your Dad probably is giving you unfair treatment because you\u2019re his daughter so he may feel more protective over you and you are slightly older than your brother, so he\u2019s trying to navigate that situation. by being strict, he\u2019s trying to stop \u201cthe worst\u201d (sneaking out, doing things you\u2019re not supposed to in your room) before it happens. definitely NOT saying it\u2019s okay though, as it sounds like you\u2019ve never breached his trust before. also, any kid should be allowed to shut their door! you need your own space and privacy.", "NTA, your father is violating fire safety codes.  Run to your mother's house.", "NTA, kid, get out!\n\nThere's being too strict a parent and there's being an utter creep.\n\nPlus, the latest incident - looking at his underage daughter in the shower, possibly naked - is not just morally but legally wrong. If proven, it can get him arrested.", "NTA, his behaviour and actions are creepy and dangerous. Speak with your mom and get out as soon as you can.", "NTA\n\nGet out of there now. Today. What he's doing is not normal and downright dangerous. By law you need a window in bedrooms for an escape route in case of a fire, and he's gone and glued the window shut?\n\nHe's unhinged and you don't have to put up with this one second longer. Move in with your mom before he does anything worse. This is abuse and it's quickly escalating and you are NOT safe!!\n\nETA: You need to tell your mother everything and report this to CPS!", "NTA- Your father is possibly taking video/ pictures of you in the bathroom, glued your windows shut, doesn\u2019t let you close your door, and is now not allowing you to eat. You should not step foot in his house again until he seeks help for whatever mental illness is causing his paranoia.", "NTA \n\nTell your mother now. If you can't, call CPS or tell a trusted adult at school. This is a very serious situation and you need help NOW. Try your best to not spend another night there.", "It\u2019s usually around this age a child can make their own custody decisions, speak up and make yours. Your mom will help, I\u2019m sure. More importantly though, tell her and ideally the courts/CPS about his spying on you while showering. This is concerning and he needs help or to lose unattended custody of your little brother entirely, depending on how far gone he is.\n\nYou\u2019re struggling, this has nothing to do with you though. You are not to blame for his behaviors. I say this because it kind of feels like you\u2019re trying to understand it through the context of cause and effect but I honestly don\u2019t think that is the case here, more like his own paranoia.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your dad is exhibiting some genuinely concerning behavior", "NTA\n\nPlease, leave. As soon as you can safely get out, you need to go to your moms. If it\u2019s easier, get to a different place of safety and contact your mom from there.\n\nGet help. As soon as you can.", "NTA\n\nTell a teacher of yours what\u2019s going on.  They\u2019ll report it to CPS and hopefully you\u2019ll never have to go back to that awful place.", "NTA\n\nHave you told your mom about the gluing shut of the windows? As others have said, that's a fire hazard and illegal in a bedroom. \n\nI would also tell her ASAP about the looking at you in the bathroom using his phone and the forbidding you food as punishment. Because your mom needs to take all of this to a lawyer.", "NTA. This is abuse. You should not be in that house with him, and neither should your brother. You need to alert the authorities ASAP. Talk to a teacher; they generally (depending where you are) have mandatory reporting obligations and can kickstart the process.", "NTA. Your father is behaving bizarrely. Denying food is abuse. Looking under the door is beyond creepy. Gluing a window shut is beyond the pale. Go to your mother's and hopefully it will be more peaceful for you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
