Their Mother when picking them up demanded to know why we'd made them eat in their rooms as if they weren't \"good enough\" to eat with us. My husband explained that they'd had the option to eat with us the dinner i'd prepared but they didn't want it so we'd gotten them takeout but with my daughters allergies they couldn't eat it around her.

I mean, it was their first night over with their dad's *new* family. They might have felt pushed away. They might be worried that's how dinners will always be handled when their over.

They are there to spend time with their dad, so have dinner be a time for them all to connect. Have dinner with your daughter earlier and let the three of them eat afterwards or have your husband take them out to eat instead. Maybe you could pack your daughters food up and do a picnic with her outside when the weathers nice to give the three of them time to clean up before she comes back in. \n\nI wouldn't beat yourself up over it, but I'd use the information as feedback to do something different during future sleepovers. \n\nNAH", "NAH, but you will have to figure things out as your daughter gets older.

You didnt force it on them, if anything I think it was pretty nice and accommodating that you offered the takeout. You could have just told them what you prepared was the only option; most parents don't order takeout because their kids are refusing to eat what they made.

She admitted that she herself would have preferred to eat something else, but she prioritizes her young child's life over her own dining preferences.", "Or her and her daughter have a picnic and movie in her room. That away she gets to make her daughter feel special and her hubby can spend one on one time with his kids.", "You have no idea how long a deep clean for an allergen exposure takes do you? i'd have had to have stripped that entire room and spent the rest of the night cleaning it without anyone able to come in.
