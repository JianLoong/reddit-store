The truth was it's not a name I am actually crazy about or like. But I never talk negatively about people's names to them or their parents. I keep my thoughts like that to myself. SIL and I were out together and I ran into one of my students parents I'm friendly with (I'm a teacher) and she introduced her new baby to me and told me his name and I told her I loved it and even had it on my own baby name list for the future. SIL made a face while the parent and I were talking and after we moved on she asked me why I had that name on my list of future baby names when I never mentioned having Elizabeth on the list. I told her I don't have every name on the list. She told me I never really liked Elizabeth then. I said I never told her that but any name used in the family, on either side would be off my list anyway. She got upset and told me I should have told her I hated it and it was ugly if that's how I really felt. She stormed off.\n\nShe called my husband after and told him about what happened. He told her she was overreacting. She told him I was fake for complimenting the name when I didn't actually like it.

Should I have pretended she never asked in the first place?\n\nETA because I just realized this might be asked: The name is fine.

If you like it a lot, I\u2019m happy for you, as I don\u2019t need to love your child\u2019s name - only you, your partner and child do.\u201d would\u2019ve sufficed.", ">She asked because she wanted an honest opinion.\n\nOr she asked bc she's a new mom who wants confirmation that she chose a good name for her kid. I know we say a lot on this sub \"don't ask if you don't want the answer\", but there's always nuance to questions like these. Sometimes ppl ask questions when really they just want to be told their opinion is correct. If they want an honest answer, they'll usually preface that by actually saying \"now give it to me straight\" or something like that. \n\nAlso, I don't believe OP technically lied. OP said it was a lovely name for the SIL's daughter, which does *not* contradict OP's personal disinterest in the name.", ">She told me I never really liked Elizabeth then.\n\nSee now this is the part where I would have diverged completely from your responses. Instead of defending myself from this accusation, I'd ask her why the fuck she's making shit up", "NTA\n\nAs someone who has named her daughter something unusual- I thank you for keeping your opinions to yourself.\n\nSome people have given their uninvited brutally honest opinions and I have not appreciated it. Most people love the name though. \n\nWe don\u2019t all have to like the same things and it\u2019s just not nice to yuck someone else\u2019s yum. SIL sounds way OTT", "Nta she's being ridiculous you never once told her you hated her child's name", "NTA, it's not that big of a deal to have one name not on your list for baby names. On the other hand, your SIL is an AH.", "As many others have said it\u2019s normal to like a name or at least think it\u2019s fine without loving it enough to want to name your own child it.  Like you, I like the classic names but they weren\u2019t ever what I was going to name a child myself. I ended up with a very uncommon name and one that actually became quite popular. Lots of people tell me how much the like my uncommonly named child\u2019s name, but I know it\u2019s not one they\u2019d have even considered because otherwise it would be more common.\n\nYour SIL should probably be thankful you didn\u2019t say you hated the name.\n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know many teachers that have gone for more common or classic names as they have taught so many of them (and probably have bad experiences from at least one of those named children!)", "NTA she\u2019s kind of insane", "NtAH but she is overly sensitive.  I actually love the name Elizabeth but would never name one of my kids that because I have plenty of family/friends with that name. I wanted my kids to have names that was theirs alone except for my son.  We could not agree on what to name him so he got the tried and true Jr.  If I had my way, he would have been a Tristan or Gabriel.  I like the older - longer names that can be shortened.  \n\nI was raised if you have nothing nice to say (especially with family/friends) don't say nothing at all.  Now do I always practice that - no.  But you did nothing wrong at all.  Had you said you did not like the name - you would have heard about that too.", "So she *needed* you **love** the name enough to use it yourself? Can you imagine how awkward it would've been if you did!\ufffc\n\nIt kind of sounds like she's just one of those people you can't win with. \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nThis is wild. Can\u2019t imagine handling it any better than what you did. And why would your opinion be so important to your SIL anyway? Weird.", "NTA\nMy mom is also a teacher and I know his kids names and that last part is soo true. So many Mateos, Ikers, Dantes, you realize how used a name is so you don't feel the same about those names", "Please consider also that she\u2019s (I think?) months out from delivery and things might not be completely back to normal for her emotionally or hormonally. Not that that gives her the right to go off on you, but take it as a compliment that she feels safe enough with you to get a little out of control. I mean, hold her to reasonable adult behavior, but once you give her a little time to cool down, and if she acts better and maybe slips in a little apology, let her know you\u2019re honored she didn\u2019t feel she had to hide that vulnerability from you but don\u2019t be mean to you like that again. And re-emphasize that you two are close and you hope your kids will be close, so even if her daughter\u2019s name was literally the only thing you ever wanted to name your hypothetical child, you\u2019d never steal her thunder like that.\nEdit:  NTA", "No I can guarantee she would have flipped her shit if you'd been even slightly honest about her name choice.\n\nSeems like she's searching for a reason to dislike you or create drama", "Judging by her reaction to this, I think it's safe to assume she would anyway have thrown a fit if you had been \"brutally honest\" and said you didn't like it. \n\nNTA", "I'm never having kids, but before I made that decision I thought about names I like and what I don't like in regards to naming kids. My biggest pet peeve is people naming twins similarly. (Sandy/Mandy or both start with the letter C sort of deal.) So if I had twins (a possibility cause they run in my family) I would have made sure to give them drastically different names so it doesn't add to the confusion of them.", "This. Apparently unless OP is desperately jealous that SIL snagged the name there was no right answer. That woman has some issues and there will probably be future one sided competition.", "That would drive me crazy. My parents gave us all names ending in -n and that was bad enough! From halfway across the house, if you only hear the ending, you have no idea whose name was called. \n\nOf course, I named my kids totally different names and I still misname them all the time, so it\u2019s a mess no matter what.", "I promise you 100% if you had been \u201cbrutally honest\u201d about the name, she\u2019d be mad. Either she is a huge drama queen in general or she\u2019s mad at you for something else and looking to pick a fight because this is one of the weirdest, pettiest nonissues I\u2019ve ever heard of being made into a thing. \n\nUnless you name your child something so outlandish it becomes cruel, names don\u2019t have objective facts to them. There\u2019s no perfect name. We all have different taste.", "Might be a cultural difference then.", "NTA - I can't even understand what she is upset about.   You didn't do anything wrong.", "NTA your actions and thoughts are spot on. Sil is acting insane", "NTA drama llama alert", "You've been caught in an over-the-top white lie that makes you seem untrustworthy. You could have said \"lovely name\" and left it at that, but you went beyond that. NTA for the sentiment of being polite. But now you SIL is questioning what else you lie about. IMO, that is the core of the situation and why the SIL is upset.", "NTA and why does what you think really matter? It\u2019s her kid not yours.", "NTA, I think she was looking for drama here or else looking to take a name you wanted. I'd just ignore this and let it blow over. You were 100% right to not insult the name or have any kind of negative comment on it, that would have been worse.", ">She got upset and told me I should have told her I hated it and it was ugly if that's how I really felt.\n\nIf you had done that, you would be the ass.\n\nNTA", "You said it was a lovely name for *her* baby. That\u2019s not lying! You never said it was your favorite name or that it was on your baby name list or anything. She\u2019s super overreacting and you\u2019re NTA"]}
