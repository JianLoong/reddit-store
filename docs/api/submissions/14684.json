She asked me before she gave birth what I thought of the name and I told her it was a lovely name for her daughter. SIL was happy and had her baby and went on about her life. The truth was it's not a name I am actually crazy about or like. But I never talk negatively about people's names to them or their parents. I keep my thoughts like that to myself. SIL and I were out together and I ran into one of my students parents I'm friendly with (I'm a teacher) and she introduced her new baby to me and told me his name and I told her I loved it and even had it on my own baby name list for the future. SIL made a face while the parent and I were talking and after we moved on she asked me why I had that name on my list of future baby names when I never mentioned having Elizabeth on the list. I told her I don't have every name on the list. She told me I never really liked Elizabeth then. I said I never told her that but any name used in the family, on either side would be off my list anyway. She got upset and told me I should have told her I hated it and it was ugly if that's how I really felt. She stormed off.\n\nShe called my husband after and told him about what happened. He told her she was overreacting. She told him I was fake for complimenting the name when I didn't actually like it. He told her I never said that.\n\nSo okay, it is true, but I always thought it was shitty to insult people's baby names and you should always keep those opinions to yourself.\n\nBut AITA for not being honest? Should I have pretended she never asked in the first place?\n\nETA because I just realized this might be asked: The name is fine. It's just for me, I am not into very popular names and there are some names I have heard repeatedly as a teacher and they feel overdone to me.

You may like a name but it doesn't mean it has to be in \"your list\" because it isn't meaningful to you. Just that. Let her rant alone and, when she's over it, she can come back and talk to you like a normal adult.", "NTA but I'd probably stop complimenting baby names and instead focus in the baby.

Of those hundreds, are you even going to have 20 on your list?\n\nElizabeth is a prefectly solid name, for heaven's sake.

That\u2019s next-level nitpicking and super intrusive. \n\nShe picked a fight with you and put words in your mouth.\n\nIt is perfectly appropriate not to be stupidly honest and say insulting things, and she is acting super insecure in twisting your arm to force you to admit your hatred of this name.", "NTA. She asked for your opinion. You did not say it to spare her feelings, and she still got mad.", "NTA. Everything you said is a sensible way to deal with names", "NTA - Seriously? Your SIL likely is still coming off pregnancy hormones because that\u2019s an weird thing to get upset at. Just because you said you thought the name was lovely doesn\u2019t mean you want to name your own kids that. It also doesn\u2019t mean you hate the name just because it\u2019s not something you\u2019d choose. It\u2019s completely ok and normal to smile and say that\u2019s a lovely name but know in your heart you\u2019d never use it for your own kids. And it should not be bothering your SIL so much because this is not your kid it\u2019s hers and she\u2019s the one who needed to like the name not you. \n\nYou\u2019ll have no problem saying your nieces name and knowing and loving her as Elisabeth. Maybe SIL just needs a little vacation because she\u2019s stressing herself out for no reason.", "You're NTA. It sounds like she projected some insecurity (or even dislike) of her own for her baby's name onto you.

You were also recognizing the fact that people are allowed to name their babies what they like even though you don't like the name. She should have just let it go.", "Nya- you were happily keeping your opinion to yourself and she blew up at you....for what sounds like jealousy that Elizabeth wasn't on your baby list. My step daughter is an Elizabeth and has picked a different name in school because everyone is named Elizabeth.  I did the same in school being a Sarah.", "You are so NTA. What a thoughtful and considerate sister-in-law you are! You acted with grace and tact. There was nothing wrong with your execution. Your SIL is just sensitive right now, whether it's hormones doing their thing/ppd/ppa, someone else having made an unsavory comment, or something else entirely. You did great; there was nothing you could have done better imo.", "NTA. your SIL sounds like a lot to deal with. lol.", "YTA, she asked you about your opinion, and you lied.

There are so many names out there and everyone has their own criteria. \n\nImo it's fine and the polite thing to keep doing as you've done up to now.

You didn't berate anyone, it is a preference. SIL is unhinged.", "NTA. It's not a straight up love or hate it situation.

I have an absurdly long list of rules for baby names when it comes to naming my own kids, one of which is I will not use the name if it\u2019s popular. But Olivia is still a SUPER cute name and I will coo at your baby Olivia all day long.", "I agree she probably would have!  By her reaction though I wonder if SIL thought in her head that she was stealing a name that OP liked and wanted to get at OP for some reason by doing that, but now she knows OP would never have used Elizabeth, then SIL is now disappointed", "There\u2019s nothing wrong with complimenting baby names, although I wouldn\u2019t open that can of worms in front of SIL anymore.

How fucking exhausting. It's fine to say that the name is lovely, because it is whether you personally would name your kid that or not.\n\nTact is not lying, it's not even lying by omission. It's a social skill, and if you dismiss it because it's easier and more gratifying to be an asshole, that's a mistake you'll regret.", "It's not something my husband's family are against (reusing names for cousins or other family members) so none of them would take a name off for being used. My husband and I are different. I definitely am.", "You denied her the opportunity to prego-rage on you /s.\n\nThe only people who have to agree to the name are the baby's parents; anyone that adds their two cents in a non-congratulatory manner is an AH.", "Exactly how you handled it this time. I don\u2019t know what her deal is but you did nothing wrong.", "Handle it exactly the same way. You were polite and considerate. You didn\u2019t lie. You did it was a nice name. It is!
