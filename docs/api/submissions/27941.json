As I scanned into the building and started walking in the guy tried to come in behind me. I started to close the door behind me and the guy said \u201cwhat the fuck?\u201d So I said, \u201cif you don\u2019t live here I can\u2019t let you in.\u201d \n\nThe guy said \u201cI\u2019m here for o see my girlfriend\u201d I replied \u201cokay, like I said if you don\u2019t live here, you can\u2019t come in. The building is locked it\u2019s reason.\u201d\n\nThe guy went off and said he has every right to come in to a building his girlfriend pays to live in and calling me a douchebag.

Point is, you don't know what his real intentions were, besides, if he was waiting for his girlfriend he could call her to let him in, if she even wanted to see him.\n\nBut still, it's safer.

It\u2019s so frustrating! If someone says they\u2019re there to see a friend, we tell them, cool, their friend can let them in then. I\u2019ll even circle the block or pop into the corner store if I see someone trying to get into the building that I don\u2019t know (usually just trying to buzz numbers till someone buzzes them in), and wait till they leave.
