For all we know, they could be either inside jokes or he gives occasional updates because they could be curious about his life.

It most likely is fake anyways.\n\nYWBTA.", "What do you think the teacher is doing wrong here?

The teacher may have mentioned once that he's not married and the kids just ran with it. Saying things like he \"had a chance\" could very well be based on their own interpretations of what it means to be single. So if that's all you've got against this teacher than YTA if you report him.", "NTA, Report.\nI bet the parents dont agree, what if any studen live in a protected house?", "Not at all OP\n\nIn fact, you would be doing these children a favor by reporting this as it is completely inappropriate.", "NTA I would report it. Tiktok videos of your students work is weird as is. If the school doesn't think they're doing anything wrong it should be fine. If the school finds something weird you've just done a service.", "NTA. Report him. I'm of the opinion that if a teacher is talking about their personal life in detail so much that the kids know about their love life they probably aren't using their time to actually teach the required material. Teacher needs to be reviewed.", "Links or it didn't happen.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I just think if my kiddo came home to me and told me all about their teachers love life I might be pretty concerned", "Do you think just privately emailing the school would cause him to lose his job? I\u2019d like to think there would be due process and they\u2019d investigate", "Yeah see I get that, that\u2019s why I\u2019m not blasting it all over social media or anything, but I just find it weird. One of the students even wrote \u201cyou need a lover\u201d that\u2019s just weird for so many 4th grades to have the same weird opinion unless it\u2019s something the teacher put on them ya know?", "I wasn\u2019t looking to ruin their career, was hoping maybe the school would have a convo with them over that is appropriate to talk to the kiddo about and why is not, but it\u2019s been made apparent that that is likely not what will happen. Thanks for your input!", "I just think that as an adult, you have to be picky about what you talk to students about, and decide if it\u2019s appropriate for their age. Talking about not having a girlfriend with high school seniors? A little weird, but they have a better understanding. \nTalking about it with 9-10 year olds? So often that they think it\u2019s so important to you as a person that they write it down on an assignment? Unprofessional if you ask me. I mean when I was that age, because I had teachers not talking about that, I would have written down something corny like \u201c a fire fighter cause they are cool\u201d or something. Not literally \u201csomeone who needs a girlfriend\u201d\nI don\u2019t think they should be fired, but coached in what is appropriate and what is not. Their profile indicate they used to teach highschool so maybe they need to understand the differences between that and 4th grade.", "Yeah, the folks in this thread who don't think this video is a problem are nuts.

You really have no idea what the situation actually is.", "Teachers have been set up and fired for less. They could investigate but after a certain point, especially if the teacher is innocent, they retain that mark on their person. That's how I see it anyways. People will likely disagree but hey, it's an opinion.", "once an accusation is made against someone it can't be undone. even if they're cleared 100% of the time the the damage has already been done", "If the kids are writing it on tests I bet they are talking to their parents about it to. This feels like an issue that would potentially resolve itself without any guilt from your end.", "I don't think you're unjustified, but I think without further context of the person, it is not fair to make a judgement about them. I think if a parent or colleague of the teacher saw the tik toks and decided based on informed knowledge that it was too much, then it's completely warranted as an investigation.\n\nIf the flipside happened to you, an internet stranger made an assumption because they saw some post you made and went to your school board about you, you would be equally annoyed because they've never interacted with you and thus do not know your work, no?", "or...did they refuse to disclose their relationship status or said something like \"I had a gf once, it didn't work out\" and dropped it and the kids have taken it and run with it as a means to \"tease\" the teacher? \n\nIm not saying that what you're stating isn't valid, it very well may be, but I would want more information than a 3 min TikTok before I turned someone in for being \"inappropriate\". \n\nWhat grade do you teach?", "Bro you are literally asking the sub if you would be the asshole for ruining this person's life.", "A valid opinion, thanks for your input", "True, thanks for the input", "All very valid points, thank you for your insight", "That is very insightful thank you.\n\nI\u2019m a para educator actually, have bounced around grade levels", "There\u2019s a difference between privately messaging the school, and blasting this info for Reddit to see and make their own decisions on how to handle it?", "No worries!", "What I'm saying is, if you're having reservations about blasting it, you should probably have the same reservations about contacting the authorities about it. I probably wouldn't do anything unless there was a clear indication of possible minor abuse.", "That\u2019s solid advice, thank you"]}
