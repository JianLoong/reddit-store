Within about a year we discovered he was sick, very very sick. And I cared for him until he passed. While he was sick it was very difficult to get any help at all from his family, and I eventually quit my 9-5  job to care for him. His family didn't really help me with anything, and were in the Hills of Denial for almost the whole time.

My inlaws both passed during covid, and my BIL (husband's brother - 50M) was clearing out the dad's condo, and in the storage area found a bunch of stuff that Husband had stored there, including -thousands- of comic books from the 70's, 80's and 90's.\n\nHusband didn't have much - ok, anything really - and he even downgraded his life insurance the last year of his life - \"to save money\" (it was a side effect of his brain not working, he was super focused on money, but in weird ways).

I don't believe BIL had any right to give those things to the kids. They were Husband's, which makes them mine. Of course if things had gone how they should have I would have let the kids pick out their favorites - but we don't have a lot, and selling these old and well cared for comics would be a huge help to me and to the household.

This isn't the quick cash flow you think it is. Don't ruin your relationship with your kids over this.", "YTA.

Most comics of value are pre 70's (very few 90's issues are worth anything because of the comic buying craze). There's probably some gems in there but until you go through them, grade them and price them, you might end up spending more time/money than they're worth.

The only way you can take them back is by destroying your relationship.  Let it go, it's not worth the damage you will do all around to pursue this.", "Sorry, YTA.\n\nThey were at your inlaws home, not yours.

If he did have an inkling that you might want to sell them off, I don't have it in me to call him an AH for wanting to make sure the kids got access to them first. \"I want the kids to have things that belonged to their dad\" is not an AH take from him. I don't blame the kids for being unwilling to part with the books. You lost your partner, they lost their dad.

However, I think your moral and legal claims to the comics and their value are specious. \n\nHaving been left with the in-laws for so long both before and, especially, after his death and through the passing of the in-laws, the comics are likely to be considered part of the in-laws\u2019 estate and not your husband\u2019s. Distributing them to his adult children was a perfectly reasonable course of action.  \n\nAnyways, unless you are sure that some particular comic has a very high value, you are unlikely to be losing much monetarily in order to allow your children to have them for their sentimental value. For anything not super, super rare and in great condition, you\u2019d be looking at values for which you\u2019d only get some small percentage of full retail value.

While my judgment about the comic books may have been y-t-a, I admire the care and dedication you showed to your husband and find it very admirable.", "I am so, so sorry that everyone is being so brutal to you. I am so sorry for your loss, all of them-your husband, your job, the whole life you had planned out. You gave up sooo much and did so much for him, and I think it really shows true love that you cared for him until his death. You seem like a really great person, and don\u2019t deserve the treatment you\u2019re getting. I don\u2019t think yta for wanting to sell them. If it were me and my husband I would want my family to be taken care of more than them to have a specific thing of mine. I\u2019ve got plenty of things, and it was in storage not something he kept close that would be sentimental, there\u2019s other things of his Im sure, and you still were gonna let them pick what they wanted.", "[removed]", "I'm glad we have the unquestionable arbiter of what can be considered sentimental items here. Do you know if OP's husband ever talked to the kids about his comic collection or showed it to them? No.", "or perhaps dad was storing them but had forgotten them for the time being cos he was sick and had other priorities?\n\nit couldnt have meant much to him or her but maybr kids would still want them cos they were dad's?\n\ni know for sure id want.", "Solidly NTA. It\u2019s tragic for your kids that their dad died, but there is no reason not to use his assets to better life for OP and their kids, especially with him essentially fucking them over financially with brain not working financial decisions. \n\nGet valuations from a reputable organisation to help you on this and so you don\u2019t get ripped off. Figure out what everything is really worth from someone who understands comic appraisal. Value your time - you quit your job and lost wages as a result. Calculate what that\u2019s worth. Calculate the hit your career took when you left the workforce to care for him. And think through some valuation of that. \n\nOP, it\u2019s probably a good idea to explain what you think the money would mean to you and to the kids - including how your husband\u2019s death has screwed up your retirement prospects, college funds, etc. Unless your kids have been in a position to have to contribute financially, this whole situation is essentially meaningless to them. \n\nAnd then tell them they can pick out some small number of favourites they can keep. Be clear with them on the valuation of whatever they chose and then deduct that value from the college fund or whatever, and make sure that the split is even between the two kids. Alternatively, you can subtract compensation to you for the financial hit you took, then split the collection between the kids and let them sell off or keep the remainder. \n\nTo them, right now this is \u201cnice memento of dad that might be worth something.\u201d But it\u2019s also not something they connected directly with him - like you\u2019re not talking about how he read these to the kids as bedtime stories or whatever. You need to put it into context. \n\nAnd you are absolutely correct - these were yours.", "Yes selling other people's property is just so very noble and selfless! I missed the bit where she wanted to sell HER OWN stuff. OP is absolutely TA. Trying to steal and sell her own children's property! Her declaration that comics he had before he even met her is fucking hilarious too.", "The comics were not their dad\u2019s, they belonged to their grandfather, who died after their dad did. That\u2019s why their uncle gave them directly to the kids; he assumed that since grandfather wanted their father to have them that their father would want them to have the comics. \n\nI\u2019m sure there are plenty of other mementos of their father other than the comics in the home", "And those kids have literally nothing else to remember him but a bunch of OLD comic books which probably are WORTH A FORTUNE which they didn't even know about nor connected with him until recently?! Oh come on!\n\nNTA OP! You sacrificed your mental, physical and financial health to care for your husband and you deserve some stability and recover. The books are yours, the kids have other memories to hold dear. Some, that even have a history with their dad, not just something that randomly appeared after his death and had nothing to do with their relationship. \nYou could be fair tho and have them choose 1 or 2 of their favourites to keep.", "Do they need thousands of things? Why not grab the few that have meaning, or just \"some\" if none of them have any individual meaning? Then sell the other X998 for what I've got to believe would be *at least* a few thousand dollars.", "I feel like they can have something to remember him by, and she could sell a significant portion of them.", "I know right? So weird of people to claw at the expensive items. Its no secret that the only items I would like from my family is a frog sponge holder and this tiny painting my mom got from goodwill.", "What nice, friendly and positive exchange!", "They got back together.

I inherited 40 thousand comics, they are for the most part worthless", "Honestly, unless the collection has the right comics they\u2019re all basically worthless.

It sounds like she is drowning and she saw this as a potential way to get out of the mountain of debt her husband unfortunately put her in. I agree she shouldn't sell them if the kids don't want her to, but she's not an AH for asking them since she is respecting their wishes. Have some empathy. I can't imagine being in her position.", "Do you think that he would want the comics to still be around or for his family to be taken care of? Because if it were me that died and my husband and kids in the situation then I would want them taken care more than them having a specific thing to remember me by. People have lots of things, and something that he kept near would almost certainly have more sentimental value than something he had in storage.

Her children are old enough to work, she can ask them to help out if needs be, she doesn't need to be selling off what little they have of their father for short term financial gain", "She hasn't said she's in significant debit, just that they'd help out the household. I feel like more info on her financial situation would be pretty key here.", "Eh I spend a lot of my time in comic book stores buying these for $1-3 a piece, no, i would not. the money is in the golden age comics, which is the 30s-50s.

She said she'd have let them all pick out their favorites before she sold any. I don't understand why people are responding as though she was going to completely get rid of them? I've had close family members die, and it's not normal to keep an *entire* collection of something as a keepsake when finances are bad. People normally pick some representative items to keep. If her BIL had given them directly to her, and she'd let them all pick favorites and then sold the rest to recoup some of the massive financial losses, would she still be TA?

Not a source on it they are actually adults.", "My husband sold his old comic book collection for hundreds of dollars, which makes a big difference when finances are tight, so I didn't think it was impossible that they had some value. But if what you say is true, I'm sure once she realized that they didn't have value beyond sentimental, she wouldn't sell them. She obviously wouldn't sell them if they're not worth anything. Why is it right to not even allow her to make the decision about how to handle his belongings? It's not like she was going to be evil about it. If my dad died, and my uncle found a bunch of his childhood stuff and just gave me all of it directly, completely bypassing my mom, I would be like wtf. That would be really messed up of my uncle to do. Especially if we didn't know if the stuff was worth good money or not and my mom was in a bad financial spot from taking care of my dad for years. That family was so, so cruel to OP for years, and this is such an obvious display of disrespect that I wouldn't tolerate if it were done to my own mother. If I didn't want her to sell something, I'd talk to her about it. That's how these things work. OP seems perfectly reasonable and capable of considering those requests. The problem here is that she wasn't even given a chance to consider her options and weigh those requests. She was just excluded."]}
