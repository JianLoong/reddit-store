This isn't the quick cash flow you think it is. Don't ruin your relationship with your kids over this.", "YTA.

Most comics of value are pre 70's (very few 90's issues are worth anything because of the comic buying craze). There's probably some gems in there but until you go through them, grade them and price them, you might end up spending more time/money than they're worth.

They could actually be considered to be part of your in-laws\u2019 estate and possibly legally your BIL\u2019s to inherit.  \n\nSaying that your BIL has an obligation to give you the comic books is questionable. The comic books have a sentimental value for your kids and that\u2019s likely why your BIL passed them to your kids. \n\nSince your legal right to them is very questionable, it would be best to let it go. It may be that your BIL does not intend this as a slight to you but as a way to give your children a connection to their father. \n\nYou would be an AH if you pressure your kids to give you the comic books or if you make them feel guilty for keeping them.\n\nYTA", "Is this like a ploy to just ruin your relationship with your children or something ?", "\nHow can you not see the problem here?

I know it\u2019s not ideal but she is an adult and if you\u2019re struggling to make ends meet she shouldn\u2019t be depending on you to pay her expenses.

You need assistance and you feel selling at least some of those books would be helpful and fair.  And also that while they have the right to hold onto them, things are bad and you are having trouble covering younger's \"stuff\" and may end up on her own for insurance, phone, etc until you recover.  Ironically, she may end up needing to sell some of them due to that anyway, and bro might want to step up and help her.  Or you could all together, go into (more than one place!) to get estimates of worth, if they need to be insured (yeah, that's a thing if they are valuable) and stored correctly, safely & securely.  Had a friend that took his collection with him to a new apartment and some 'buddies' were partying, got them out...in the end they got trashed and became worthless.   \n\nBottom line though, you run the risk of alienating them.  Its not a kids responsibility to support a parent and it wont help if their dad's family is still working 'behind the scenes' to undercut you.  They (both the kids and his family) are probably under some impression that you had a windfall with life insurance, etc so the straight talk financial discussion might help.  But I wouldn't push.

To be as clear as possible.", "Then use that to fund your lifestyle and bills. \n\nAlso INFO: If these comic books are so valuable, why did your late husband keep them at his parents house? Most people don\u2019t store their valuable item outside of their own home unless they feel that someone inside their home is a danger to them.\n\nDid you ever think of possibility that late husband told BIL to make sure that his kids got the comics got them instead of you?", "[deleted]", "No. I don't.

He gave them to the kids, who he (rightly) thought would appreciate them.

What a monster! /s", ">This isn't the first underhanded thing he's done.. it's just the first one that affected my family\n\nYour kids have been given their father's effects and have chosen not to sell. That might be their nest egg.\n\nYou're just coming off as greedy.", "How was he being underhanded by giving your children the comics? While your husband collected them as a child, he had long since abandoned them with his parents. They\u2019re not part of your husband\u2019s estate from his death 8 years ago \u2014 they\u2019re part of his parents\u2019 estate now. So BIL inherited them and chose to give them to your children, in memory of his brother. He had every right to do so and it was very considerate of him to do so.", "I mean, kind of YTA, but I also get it. The other thing I'm thinking about, is WHERE THE HELL DO YOU PUT THOUSANDS OF COMIC BOOKS? and do they need to keep all of them? \n\n\nThis is kind of disjointed, but:\nAbove is right, though: if there are actually thousands, it might be worth it to sit down with your kids, explain to them what you know about comics, explain where you are (I'm assuming a lot of this is because you had to quit your job because of your husbands medical needs, and then you were left on no salary, running up medical debt and regular debt), and also how this affects them (especially your daughter). \n\nTell them to discuss it among themselves, but, if they want, you'll sit down with them, go through them (maybe something will spark a memory, too), and make a list of them together. Then you all can start figuring out what would be worth it to sell (if things are *that bad* that you're literally finding shit in your house to sell, the ones that none of you care about, but others might, still could bring in a couple of bucks a pop, which would help both the kids out."]}
