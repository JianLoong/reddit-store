Before we knew he was SICK, I left him because he changed into someone that didn't speak to me, touch me, or interact with me... I tried for 2 years to \"fix\" things, but they just got worse. I have a LOT of guilt about this, but again, I didn't know. We never got divorced, and we still saw each other every day because kids and parenting.  I honestly thought he was just terribly depressed, and just wouldn't get the help he needed. That obviously wasn't the case.\n\nAnyway, through circumstances, he came back home. Within about a year we discovered he was sick, very very sick. And I cared for him until he passed. While he was sick it was very difficult to get any help at all from his family, and I eventually quit my 9-5  job to care for him. His family didn't really help me with anything, and were in the Hills of Denial for almost the whole time. So much so that while I was caring for him in the way the doctors told me to, and sharing info of what was happening with the doctors, they were accusing me of lying and of not caring for him well at all. (Husband would tell them that I was his advocate and that I was doing a great job making sure he got the care he needed etc).\n\nAll that to say, his family wasn't a fan of me, and as his heath declined, so did their opinion of me.\n\nFast Forward to now. My inlaws both passed during covid, and my BIL (husband's brother - 50M) was clearing out the dad's condo, and in the storage area found a bunch of stuff that Husband had stored there, including -thousands- of comic books from the 70's, 80's and 90's.\n\nHusband didn't have much - ok, anything really - and he even downgraded his life insurance the last year of his life - \"to save money\" (it was a side effect of his brain not working, he was super focused on money, but in weird ways). So, while we did get some life insurance, we didn't get much. And while we did get his social security, that also wasn't much.\n\nBIL gave everything of Husband's he found directly to our kids (19F and 21M) bypassing me completely.\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole. I don't believe BIL had any right to give those things to the kids. They were Husband's, which makes them mine. Of course if things had gone how they should have I would have let the kids pick out their favorites - but we don't have a lot, and selling these old and well cared for comics would be a huge help to me and to the household. But he DID give them to the kids, so any talk of selling them the kids are saying they aren't mine to sell.\n\nAITA for thinking the comics are mine, and that if I want to sell them I should be able to sell them?  \n\n\nEDIT Clearly I was wrong to want to sell the comics. I will not be pushing the issue, and they can do what they want with them. I tried to paint a clear picture in my post and in the comments. I'm not sure if I did that or not, but I did try.

Particularly, after husband's death.\n\nTherefore, when bil was cleaning out his parent's house, he divided the assets to the adult grandchildren of the descendants.

This isn't the quick cash flow you think it is. Don't ruin your relationship with your kids over this.", "YTA. You didnt even know they existed by the sounds of it and now you want to fight for them, not because they mean something to you but for money.

Most comics of value are pre 70's (very few 90's issues are worth anything because of the comic buying craze). There's probably some gems in there but until you go through them, grade them and price them, you might end up spending more time/money than they're worth.

If he did have an inkling that you might want to sell them off, I don't have it in me to call him an AH for wanting to make sure the kids got access to them first. \"I want the kids to have things that belonged to their dad\" is not an AH take from him.

The market will not be kind. And again, maybe you have valuable issues, but guess which ones will be the most sentimental to the kids? Probably the important issues or memorable ones which tend to be the valuable ones pricewise.\n\nSelling thousands of comics is not easy and 90% of the time will give you very, very little money.
