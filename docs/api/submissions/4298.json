Within about a year we discovered he was sick, very very sick. And I cared for him until he passed. While he was sick it was very difficult to get any help at all from his family, and I eventually quit my 9-5  job to care for him.

My inlaws both passed during covid, and my BIL (husband's brother - 50M) was clearing out the dad's condo, and in the storage area found a bunch of stuff that Husband had stored there, including -thousands- of comic books from the 70's, 80's and 90's.\n\nHusband didn't have much - ok, anything really - and he even downgraded his life insurance the last year of his life - \"to save money\" (it was a side effect of his brain not working, he was super focused on money, but in weird ways).

I don't believe BIL had any right to give those things to the kids. They were Husband's, which makes them mine. Of course if things had gone how they should have I would have let the kids pick out their favorites - but we don't have a lot, and selling these old and well cared for comics would be a huge help to me and to the household.

This isn't the quick cash flow you think it is. Don't ruin your relationship with your kids over this.", "YTA.

Most comics of value are pre 70's (very few 90's issues are worth anything because of the comic buying craze). There's probably some gems in there but until you go through them, grade them and price them, you might end up spending more time/money than they're worth.

Then you all can start figuring out what would be worth it to sell (if things are *that bad* that you're literally finding shit in your house to sell, the ones that none of you care about, but others might, still could bring in a couple of bucks a pop, which would help both the kids out.", "NAH. **The real asshole is a country that let's their citizens go bankrupt when they get sick.**", "To start with, I really don't like how you were treated by your husband's family. But this decision may not have been about you, at least not directly. It actually makes perfect sense that BIL made this decision with sentiment in mind and thought the kids would best appreciate their dad's collection. If he did have an inkling that you might want to sell them off, I don't have it in me to call him an AH for wanting to make sure the kids got access to them first. \"I want the kids to have things that belonged to their dad\" is not an AH take from him. I don't blame the kids for being unwilling to part with the books. You lost your partner, they lost their dad. It's normal that they'd want to hold onto as much of him as they can.\n\nThat said, you wouldn't be wrong for explaining the situation to your kids and asking them to help out financially, if they're able, with or without resorting to selling the books. You *would* be TA if you try to force the matter if they say no. I do think YTA here, albeit gently given the circumstances, for you thinking that they're automatically yours. If they were legally accounted for and specifically willed to you, that would clear things up on the legal front, but that feels pretty muddy and I'm no legal expert. It feels like your insistence on having them stems from financial duress more than anything else.

Do they really want thousands of old comics?", "YTA They actually wouldn't be yours in most jurisdictions because he owned them before he met you and we're separate property. They were never in your marital home and you didn't even know they existed until they were gifted to your children as a family heirloom... There's a stronger claim that they belonged to his parents since they likely paid for them when he was a minor than being yours as the wife he met years later.\n\nThe only way you would have a right to sell these is if the kids were still at home and you genuinely needed the money to care for them. They're adults and the rightful owners of the collection.", "You painted a clear picture.

You\u2019re coming off as very resentful of your late husband (instead of his illness). You went through something very hard and I think you would benefit from therapy. \n\nMy father died when I was 15 and saddled my mom with $70k in debt and blew our college funds before having a heart attack and dying. Oh yeah we also found out he was a drug dealer. It wasn\u2019t a good time for any of us. $50k in life insurance didn\u2019t go very far.

You have been thrift a horrible trauma and Noone that hasn't experienced the slow death of a loved one is going to understand what you have been through.

I get it. I cared for my mother for some years before her death from dementia. It is hard and often thankless. Luckily I live in Canada and don\u2019t have a monetary debt from the events but I suspect you do. I can understand why you\u2019d want to sell the comics to cover costs and manage the family financially. However, I think your moral and legal claims to the comics and their value are specious. \n\nHaving been left with the in-laws for so long both before and, especially, after his death and through the passing of the in-laws, the comics are likely to be considered part of the in-laws\u2019 estate and not your husband\u2019s. Distributing them to his adult children was a perfectly reasonable course of action.  \n\nAnyways, unless you are sure that some particular comics has a very high value, you are unlikely to be losing much monetarily in order to allow you children to have them for their sentimental value. For anything not super, super rare and in great condition, you\u2019d be looking at losing values for which you\u2019d only get some small percentage of full retail value.
