Within about a year we discovered he was sick, very very sick. And I cared for him until he passed. While he was sick it was very difficult to get any help at all from his family, and I eventually quit my 9-5  job to care for him. His family didn't really help me with anything, and were in the Hills of Denial for almost the whole time. So much so that while I was caring for him in the way the doctors told me to, and sharing info of what was happening with the doctors, they were accusing me of lying and of not caring for him well at all. (Husband would tell them that I was his advocate and that I was doing a great job making sure he got the care he needed etc).\n\nAll that to say, his family wasn't a fan of me, and as his heath declined, so did their opinion of me.\n\nFast Forward to now. My inlaws both passed during covid, and my BIL (husband's brother - 50M) was clearing out the dad's condo, and in the storage area found a bunch of stuff that Husband had stored there, including -thousands- of comic books from the 70's, 80's and 90's.\n\nHusband didn't have much - ok, anything really - and he even downgraded his life insurance the last year of his life - \"to save money\" (it was a side effect of his brain not working, he was super focused on money, but in weird ways).

And while we did get his social security, that also wasn't much.\n\nBIL gave everything of Husband's he found directly to our kids (19F and 21M) bypassing me completely.\n\nHere's where I might be the asshole. I don't believe BIL had any right to give those things to the kids. They were Husband's, which makes them mine. Of course if things had gone how they should have I would have let the kids pick out their favorites - but we don't have a lot, and selling these old and well cared for comics would be a huge help to me and to the household.

I will not be pushing the issue, and they can do what they want with them. I tried to paint a clear picture in my post and in the comments. I'm not sure if I did that or not, but I did try.

Most comics of value are pre 70's (very few 90's issues are worth anything because of the comic buying craze). There's probably some gems in there but until you go through them, grade them and price them, you might end up spending more time/money than they're worth.

If he did have an inkling that you might want to sell them off, I don't have it in me to call him an AH for wanting to make sure the kids got access to them first. \"I want the kids to have things that belonged to their dad\" is not an AH take from him. I don't blame the kids for being unwilling to part with the books. You lost your partner, they lost their dad.

However, I think your moral and legal claims to the comics and their value are specious. \n\nHaving been left with the in-laws for so long both before and, especially, after his death and through the passing of the in-laws, the comics are likely to be considered part of the in-laws\u2019 estate and not your husband\u2019s. Distributing them to his adult children was a perfectly reasonable course of action.  \n\nAnyways, unless you are sure that some particular comic has a very high value, you are unlikely to be losing much monetarily in order to allow your children to have them for their sentimental value. For anything not super, super rare and in great condition, you\u2019d be looking at values for which you\u2019d only get some small percentage of full retail value.

Again, maybe you have valuable ones. And if you sell to a collector, well, they already have all of those comics and don't need your dubiously stored copies. Finding a collector in-person who wants them and would give you top dollar for it is like finding a unicorn. Which goes back to selling online, which is a lot of work. \n\nIt may seem like you're sitting on thousands of dollars of a collection, but selling expenses will be equally huge (commission or personal time/organizing). The market will not be kind. And again, maybe you have valuable issues, but guess which ones will be the most sentimental to the kids? Probably the important issues or memorable ones which tend to be the valuable ones pricewise.\n\nSelling thousands of comics is not easy and 90% of the time will give you very, very little money. Like far less than minimum wage for the amount of work you have to do, and pennies on the dollar for a large collection. Again, maybe I'm wrong and OP has some specifically valuable ones.

What you planned to do would have probably caused your children pain, destroyed their trust in you, and damaged your relationship with them.\n\nSomething can be legal and still be a major AH move that causes you far more harm than benefit.", "> If he died without a will then she absolutely is legally entitled to the comics.\n\nAbsolutely not a forgone conclusion for property her left *abandoned* from a legal standpoint for over 20 years on his parents property. You are right to say we don't have enough info to say the comics should t go to her -- but the inverse is equally true. This is where that saying - possession is 9/10th of the law comes in. Having physical possession for 30 years without the *former* owner ever following up on them is a very very solid case for the Husbands parents to own them.\n\nIt's fundamentally not as simple as 'it goes to her.' The parents estate can claim it's their property in a very materially real way.\n\nAlso these comics are, in all likelihood, worthless.", ">How nice for some people that they can afford to let thousands of comic books be a sentimental memento instead of using them for the practicalities of everyday living\n\nAs a comic book fan of many years who amassed a similar collection during childhood, I can tell you (and OP) that most of those comics are close to worthless.  If she wants to Google them or have someone knowledgeable look through them for her, I think it would make sense to sell any rare gems of actual value in the collection that are identified, but your typical old comic won't get you more than a few cents, so keeping most of that collection for the kids is actually probably reasonable.  Old comics aren't the financial bonanza that a lot of people think they are.", "NTA and will bet that the kids will research their value and sell them themselves. Not negating they see sentimental value but again I bet they will keep some and sell the others", "Depending on the books and grades of them, some of those may very well pay for college if the kids sell them.  Especially with all the Marvel and DC movies out.", "Thank you! The kids didn\u2019t even know they existed until the BIL unearthed them.

My dads T-shirts have huge sentimental value to me, and OP explains these are also things he collected (and presumably kept in his house, unlike the comics that were stored unseen at his parents)", "She quit her job to take care of him while he died, as well as the kids, and his life insurance was small. She had no help. I really don't think it's so horrible that she'd like to get some money from any assets he had so that she can try to get her life back on track. The kids have no memory of these comic books and didn't even know they existed. They really need to keep all of them as mementos while their mother drowns? NTA", "All of this took place a DECADE ago. OPs kids are now adults and it is not clear from the post if they currently live with her or on their own. OP would absolutely be TA ago try and force her adult children to give these mementos of their dad to her to sell. It seems like an excellent way to alienate her kids ifnshe forces this issue.", "Whatever about selling them or not you can\u2019t say they\u2019re not sentimental.\nI think discovering your deceased fathers massive comic collection creates a *massive* sentimental value.

Unless a will states otherwise doesn\u2019t his stuff pass to her?", "I\u2019ll actually agree with you and say I misspoke. They could be sentimental in a different way because it\u2019s a part of your dad maybe you didn\u2019t even know existed. \n\nI still think that the right move is to liquidate them to pay bills. Sometimes being a grown up sucks and means we have to make tough choices. \n\nSucks all the way around for everyone.", "They are not hers. The comics have nothing to do with her. I've noticed she hasn't mentioned selling her own stuff off, just the stuff already given to children. Talk about selfish.", "It really depends.

As someone who\u2019s friend died of it I know how terribly brutal it is.
