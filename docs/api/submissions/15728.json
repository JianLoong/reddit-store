I then told her through my teeth that I wanted another nurse.\n\nShe turned back the way we came. In a not-whisper, she told the other nurse, \"She wants a new nurse, because apparently misreading her weird name means I can't take her blood pressure properly.\"\n\nI felt so embarrassed. I just walked right out the entry door, back to my car and drove home. \n\nI had parked when I got a call from the wellness center's office, telling me it was unprofessional to walk out of my appointment and I would be charged a no-show fee. I didn't even respond, I just hung up.\n\nI'm mad and thinking of calling them back to explain why I refuse to pay the fee (I was checked in) but before I do, I need to figure out if I overacted.

I sympathize with you about how obnoxious it is.\n\nEdit to add NTA.", "Got a call from the doctor himself within an hour regarding the issue.", "And also be sure to leave a negative review on their website if possible.", "Even then, honest mistakes happen (as OP mentioned, it happens frequently), but how a person responds to the mistake is the more important part. And that nurse was a huge AH. \n\nNTA, OP.", "I didn't add this in cause I wasn't sure it was relevant, but I'm a woman of color so I do have some issues with making waves - I don't want to be labeled the angry latina. So I totally relate to being too ashamed to complain, even when I know I should.", "Lol. That would be perfect!", "Yep, doctors hate bad reviews. Left one for mine regarding his office staff who are out of control and rude as all hell. \n\nGot a call from the doctor himself within an hour regarding the issue.", "When you write the review, OP, be sure to point this out. \"This nurse, who refused to believe I'd know my own name, mocked it to my face, suggested I get married to change it, and threw a tiny tantrum when I asked for a different nurse, had the gall to suggest I was the one behaving unprofessionally.\"", "I'm so used to having my name questioned that I usually start with the explanation - \"And my last name is Michelle just like the girl's first name\". Most people are pretty nice about it, this was the first time someone made me feel like it was my fault they stumbled on getting my name right. I have an older brother who did ROTC and he ended up changing his last name to our mother's much less unusual maiden name due to all the teasing.", "I used to work at a newspaper doing wedding announcements. I was engaged at the time, so I\u2019d make small talk about wedding planning and the like while I processed their stuff. One lady looked at my desk name plate, and said, \u201cI bet you can\u2019t wait to change your last name.\u201d (It\u2019s an Eastern European name that gets butchered a lot.)\n\nI told her, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not taking my (now ex) husband\u2019s last name. I\u2019m keeping mine to honor my father, who died when I was 5.\u201d Shut her up real quick. \n\nBut NTA. She made a mistake and she should have apologized.", "Totally fair. I should have been more proactive, honestly. Especially because I had never been to that wellness center before and knew to anticipate something to happen with my name. Lesson very much learned!", "Excellent advice.", "Oh my god, that's horrible! I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I'm anemic and I'm Hispanic, so that combo of dark skin and small veins can make it tricky getting needle properly stuck, so what happened to you is one of my worst fears! And you're right, in this current environment its even more important than before that we are able to trust medical professionals and hold them to the highest of standards.", "Oh man, I think that is relevant! I know people of color get mocked and disrespected about their names as a common microaggression/overt racism.  I'm so sorry this happened.", "If you are in the US, Many centers will have a patient advocate. If you are nervous about calling to complain, they often have email. I would definitely\nReport this interaction. If the nurse was rude to you she is likely rude to others as well.", "sooooo relevant. underlying prejudice i am sure, causing them to react even more rudely to you. gosh, i am so sorry.", "Thank you, I appreciate that! Even if my name is strange, I'm proud of it and my culture! :)"]}
