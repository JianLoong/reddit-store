But lately I can't ignore those comments anymore because I've gotten tired. My SIL (35F) is the one who insists the most on this matter, she thinks that a smartphone is very necessary for a child because it connects them with their friends, I told her that it can also connect them with dangerous people and that I want to avoid that, that I wouldn't like her to end up like me, and don't get me wrong, I don't regret having children so young because I adore them but sometimes I wish my parents had been more careful and taught me more things, so i want to be better as a parent. \n\nWhen I said that my SIL said that I am being dramatic that my daughter will hate me and that she will resent us for having forbidden her something so important at this age. I told her that she is happy, and that when she wants to communicate with her friends she does it with my phone, so she is fine. But she went on and on with the same thing, and I got tired and yelled at her to tell her to shut up, that I don't want to be like her who bought her four-year-old child a phone to give it to him every time he cries, that I want to spend quality time with my children and that when they grow up they remember that and not stupid videos from internet. Of course she got mad and ended up leaving my house without even saying goodbye, but I didn't care and went on with my life. Until I started receiving messages from my in-laws saying that what I did was wrong because I made her feel bad, that she is a single mother and that is why she needs her son to be entertained with a phone, that she is waiting for an apology, and I told them that I will apologize when she apologizes to me first for having told me the things that she has been saying to me for years. And I say that because it's normal for me to hear her always make fun of me because of the age at which I had my kids so I'm tired, I had to tell her what I told her because I'm sick of her thinking she's a better mother just because she had her kids at the \"right\" age and not at sixteen.

Your child, your rules. Kids hate us for not giving them what they want as children, but when they grow up most of them understand we give them what they needed first.

Why do they always do that?

You are 100% correct. You and your husband make all decisions related to raising your children. Anyone else's opinions are irrelevant.

And not feel comfortable talking to you about them if she has questions or something feels off/unsafe to her. \n\n\nAlso, your sister is right about bonding with friends. Smart phones didn't exist when I was 10, so my friends and I bonded over cultural references like Nickelodeon cartoons, because that's what existed.

SIL deserved to be yelled at *about what she did to OP* but that line that I quoted is offensive to all single parents and she needs to get that opinion sorted out. In the same way that if an autistic person is being an absolute asshole to me, I can't call him a retard regardless of how he's acting not because I care about him, but because it's offensive to autistic people in general.", "She was a minor.

I only got my first LG smartphone freshman year of high school, it\u2019s not a need it\u2019s a luxury.

None of this was any of her business, and the way she just wouldn't let it go was bizarre. She asked for it, and she got it.\n\nEvery family and circumstance is different as well. Our kids bugged us throughout elementary school for phones because other students had them but we always refused. There was just simply no need. We agreed that once they each began middle school it would be the right time since it's a good 20 minutes away by school bus and they would need a way to communicate with us if necessary.", "NTA ... but why do you keep arguing with this woman?

The 14-year-old brother has one with limited functionality. My 10-year-old grandson, different family, has one that he can call his parents, grandparents, emergency, and play a few games, because he stays at home by himself for a short time each day.  My 5-year-old grandaughters certainly do not have phones and have limited use of their parents' phones. They do have lots of books, board games and actual toys. Their parents play with them daily. My daughters will not consider getting them phones for several years yet. \n\nLast year, my 15-year-old granddaughter was freaked out because she kept getting calls from someone she didn't know as there was no name and the numbers were not always the same, but the calls and texts were all along the same vein and extremely vague.  She showed them to her dad, who talked to the police liaison officer at school. He was able to determine that the person contacting her was on the registered sex offender list for assault of a minor.  Police contacted him, but he gave the excuse that he was trying to reach someone for a ride and must have dialed the wrong number because they were similar. He contacted her again and my son took a picture of his gun collection and sent it to the creep saying if he contacted her again, dad would take care of the issue himself. Creep never contacted her again.  If a child isn't old enough to understand that the person they are in contact with is being deceitful or is possible dangerous, that child is not old enough to have their own full access phone.", "NTA. Stand your ground. You are the one that has to make the decisions for your children. They are you and your beloved responsibility alone. \nSounds like SIL has a hair twisted over her own parenting issues.\n\nSide note. She is probably right about one thing. You kids will probably resent you for not getting one at some point. Teenagers prone to find Anything to resent their parents for. But if you continue to make the best decisions you can for your children then they will also come day they look back and know in their heart that the same thing they resented as a teenager and pitched fits for..those are they same things that made them better adults, the same things that really showed them parental love, and they will have learned from your example how to also be a good parent to their children.\n\nI'm saying this from experience from a mother at 14 that raised my children to be excellent adults, productive members of society, and amazing parents to my precious grandbabies.\n\nSadly SIL may be learning the hard way when her little is a bit older.\n\nStay strong momma.. thoughts are with you", "NTA.

Of course she's an ass for pressing the issue but I'm certain your daughter can/could get up to all kinds of trouble with or without a smartphone and this is the first time I've ever heard someone justify no phone due to risk of teenage pregnancy.", "NTA she's overstepping her bounds and should have backed off.

I missed your age initially, but it certainly doesn't matter here you're doing a better job in this regard than she is.", "I\u2019m going with YTA because those same dangers you claim will still be there when she\u2019s 13. Phones have child locks for a reason.", "NTA- Absolutely no way should a ten year old be online unsupervised, you are completely correct.", "Honestly this really stinks of a controlling bloke and OP internalising the over control about trivial matters. Should a 10 year old have a phone? Imo it should come down to context, do all their friends have one? Can they have one without a sim card with high security settings on Facebook and only their friends and family as contacts and never take it out the house etc.\n\nI'm not suggesting that is the only way this works but arbitrary age rules of 13 is fine but 12.9 isn't is dumb and is just a control thing. You should be teaching Children about compromise and being subjective about things to ensure that your kids are happy and safe. Just having arbitrary rules you get to enforce is not for the child's best interests, it is about having a feeling of power.\n\nTldr: The fact that OP is with a man who impregnated her as a child when he was 20 reeks of a controlling asshole and this arbitrary age rule seems like a power trip rule he uses and OP has internalised. Wouldn't be surprised if there's padlocks on the fridge.", "It's not that insane. It SOUNDS insane, but my kiddo is 21, and when they were in high school, I once tried punishing them for failing a class by taking away their phone. Kid was not phased at all. Like not even bothered. Then I realized it was because they could talk to their friends using all these messenger apps like discord or Instagram on their home computer or school supplied laptop. So I told them they could have their phone back but if their grades didn't come up I would limit their Internet and data. They were like, okay whatever. Grades did not improve. \n\nI went into our phone plan and turned off their data specifically.  Then I started limiting Internet time by straight up turning off the modem 2 hours after they got home from school. Only allowed them to study/ use the laptop in the living room.\n\nThey were horrified. They didn't even realise I could do that with the Internet and data. Apparently nobody texts these days and none of their friends respond to SMS messages. \n\nAnyway, their grades improved. I turned the data/ Internet back on, and I didn't have to go to those extremes again. \n\nBut it did kind of blow my mind at the time that the key was not the phone -- it was the data plan on the phone. The Internet of it all. I was thinking \"phone=texting/ calling\" but that's not really it at all.  It's just convenient packaging for the apps.", "> We don't believe in depriving him by any means he has a tablet, Xbox, etc all of which he earned helping out doing chores.\n\nSo, basically, he has all the tech except the little one he can carry in his pocket and use to call for help in an emergency. You see, when you tell people \"my 15-year-old doesn't have a phone\", they assume you are keeping him from social media and all those \"bad things\" that happen on the internet.
