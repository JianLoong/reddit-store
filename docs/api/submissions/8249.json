But lately I can't ignore those comments anymore because I've gotten tired. My SIL (35F) is the one who insists the most on this matter, she thinks that a smartphone is very necessary for a child because it connects them with their friends, I told her that it can also connect them with dangerous people and that I want to avoid that, that I wouldn't like her to end up like me, and don't get me wrong, I don't regret having children so young because I adore them but sometimes I wish my parents had been more careful and taught me more things, so i want to be better as a parent. \n\nWhen I said that my SIL said that I am being dramatic that my daughter will hate me and that she will resent us for having forbidden her something so important at this age. I told her that she is happy, and that when she wants to communicate with her friends she does it with my phone, so she is fine. But she went on and on with the same thing, and I got tired and yelled at her to tell her to shut up, that I don't want to be like her who bought her four-year-old child a phone to give it to him every time he cries, that I want to spend quality time with my children and that when they grow up they remember that and not stupid videos from internet. Of course she got mad and ended up leaving my house without even saying goodbye, but I didn't care and went on with my life. Until I started receiving messages from my in-laws saying that what I did was wrong because I made her feel bad, that she is a single mother and that is why she needs her son to be entertained with a phone, that she is waiting for an apology, and I told them that I will apologize when she apologizes to me first for having told me the things that she has been saying to me for years. And I say that because it's normal for me to hear her always make fun of me because of the age at which I had my kids so I'm tired, I had to tell her what I told her because I'm sick of her thinking she's a better mother just because she had her kids at the \"right\" age and not at sixteen. So, am I the asshole for yelling at her?", "created_utc": 1674656991, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10kzwkq/aita_for_yelling_at_my_husbands_sister/", "score": 51, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Shoot, I know plenty of single mothers who have kids your age and older that don't allow their kids to have phones for the SAME reasons you don't allow yours to.\n\nI regret giving my kids phones so early but I only did it because their dad and I are divorced and he hated them using his phone to call me, so I kind of had to. \n\nYour daughter will not die. When she is allowed a phone she will be very grateful for it. My best friend didn't allow her daughter a phone until she was 12. Daughter was very angry from 10-12 because she didn't have a phone but she found other things to do with her time. Now that she has a phone, she's thankful and respectful with it. You're doing the right thing. And you're right, only you and your husband know whats right for your children.", "Nta.", "NTA. Respect others and you don't get yelled at and called names.

Let her lose her temper at your place or else you will always get labeled as the bad one.", "NTA, you're totally right about the phone. It can really mess up with kids' brain in a lot of ways,  and make them struggle with social interactions... Also : seeing all kind of things on the internet (violent videos, porn....) or being harassed... \n\nI don't have kids yet but when I do, I really hope i'll have the courage to not give them a phone before they're at least 13.\n\nAlso if you ended up snapping at her after years of being made fun of about the age you were when you had them, or the way you raise them... it's on her. She's your SIL though and I imagine you'd want this relationship to stay peaceful, so maybe when things cool down, it could be a good thing to go for a drink and sincerly ask her how she's doing ? She sounds lonely and insecure, as a single mom. Usually people who are so critical about other's life, are actually jealous...", "Nta.

You're not being neglectful, abusive, or in any way demeaning to your children by *not* giving them a cell phone. SIL can keep her nose and parenting abilities to herself.

I'm a single parent and after watching my cousins kids get so lost in their phones they didn't want to play with others, I decided against letting my kid have their own devices until they're much, much older so they can enjoy life and not spend it sucked into a screen with unimaginable dangers. \n\nNTA at all. Your child, your rules. Kids hate us for not giving them what they want as children, but when they grow up most of them understand we give them what they needed first. Your sister has no place trying to force you to change your parenting views. just because everyone else does it doesn't mean you and your family have to.", "NTA but I hope you are also talking to your daughter about safe sex and the risk of pregnancy. Her having a phone isn\u2019t gonna change much in terms of her not getting pregnant young.", "NTA. It's fascinating how your SIL can apparently dish out judgement on how you're parenting your child well past when you've asked her to stop, but when you turn around and say something about her parenting (even though it may have been a little bit harsh) she runs off and tells on you because her wittle feelings are hurt. Why do they always do that? Also, full support for protecting your kid by not giving her a phone, you're doing it for the right reasons and it's weird that she won't let that go - almost like she needs you to do it too because then it validates her decision to give her kid a phone.", "NTA. You are 100% correct. You and your husband make all decisions related to raising your children. Anyone else's opinions are irrelevant. I was the same way about devices, but unfortunately, their father undermined me at every turn. Nowadays, these kids sit on their rears on devices and have developed anxiety and depression (IMO its bs and only due to their lack of social skills, thanks to the digital world). My kids are 21f- pregnant (lives @ dads), 18f- pregnant (lives with her bf), 17m lives with me, but the point is they live on their phones.", "ESH.

You have a right to your opinions on whether kids should have phones or not, but it is very hypocritical to attack her for her opinions on the subject while asking her to respect your opinions. Also, it doesn't matter how \"tired\" you are of the topic, yelling and belittling others doesn't help the situation and makes you look irrational and rude. \n\nYou should apologize and calmly and rationally explain how you feel and tell SIL how the repeated discussions about this are making you feel.", "NTA", "Esh, your bad actions aren't erased because if her bad actions to begin with.", "Surprised there's not more comments about the fact a 19/20 year old got a 15/16 year old pregnant.

I understand why you lost your temper on her. If someone keeps pestering you like she has your going to lose it at some point or another.

These decisions are between myself and my husband and have nothing to do with you. Our children are safe and taken care of and beyond that is not your business.

I think you are less of an AH if she started it.\n\n\nIts your daughter, your choice, but your reasoning does not seem sound and I disagree with you. You say you wish your parents taught you more things.....so, you are refusing to teach your daughter safe phone usage from the age of 10-13 and making it forbidden. So, she's going to watch videos and do things on her friends' phones. And not feel comfortable talking to you about them if she has questions or something feels off/unsafe to her. \n\n\nAlso, your sister is right about bonding with friends. Smart phones didn't exist when I was 10, so my friends and I bonded over cultural references like Nickelodeon cartoons, because that's what existed. Friends bond over common interests.....if everyone's talking about a certain TikTok video she's never seen, she's going to feel left out. My friends and I still say things like \"But I am le tired\" because those are the memes that existed 20 years ago. \n\n\nThere were social situations that people were left out of because they were planned via AIM away status.

Without a cell phone, she can't get in touch with you. \n\n\nAnd, I used to call friends on their house phones.
