OP says he does not understand the condition which is absolutely fine, but his sister, although it is not her field of specialisation, 100% has the means to understand it **if she wants to** understand it. All she would need to do is dedicate a couple of hours of research and reading papers and she would have a basic understanding of the illness. At worst, she could pick up a phone and call someone and ask them about the illness (even if it's rare, if she picks up a phone to a former colleague who chose that specialisation and that person had not ever heard of the disorder, it is likely their own academic curiosity would drive them to do the research and get back to sister with some information) .

So when she is ready she will get started in another division of our employer with less stress. I noticed some coworkers weren\u2019t that understanding, because they had to take over her job.
