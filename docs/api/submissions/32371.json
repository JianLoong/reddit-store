They clearly have no plans to change. You seem to be putting yourself in the same situations over and over again. Hard to feel any sympathy for you.", "NTA\n\nBut you are one of you keep forcing your wife to be around these people. Your family isn't just pretentious. They're judgemental and unkind. Your wife doesn't deserve that.\n\nAs someone with an invisible disability, I have so much sympathy for your wife. Getting approved for disability was a nightmare because I didn't have a common issue. I've seen specialists all over the US. They still don't fully understand what's happening. \n\nI genuinely wish that people who doubt situations like your wife's could spend a day in her (or my) shoes. If I suddenly felt well enough to sit in an office 8-10 hours a day, I'd not only surrender my disability, I'd pay it all back. To focus on a career job. Track important events. Get up early and not be so fatigued that I literally fall asleep standing up. Your sister's career is a luxury your (college educated) wife lost. \n\nYour sister is awful. Instead of skipping the wedding I'd say, show your wife some support and go NC with people who don't care enough to understand her reality.
