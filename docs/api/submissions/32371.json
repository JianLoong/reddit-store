OP says he does not understand the condition which is absolutely fine, but his sister, although it is not her field of specialisation, 100% has the means to understand it **if she wants to** understand it. All she would need to do is dedicate a couple of hours of research and reading papers and she would have a basic understanding of the illness. At worst, she could pick up a phone and call someone and ask them about the illness (even if it's rare, if she picks up a phone to a former colleague who chose that specialisation and that person had not ever heard of the disorder, it is likely their own academic curiosity would drive them to do the research and get back to sister with some information) .

My primary was pregnant and ended up going into pre-term labor and being hospitalized. I was on work restrictions that expired in the middle of everything, and because my primary was out, no one wanted to touch my case. I either waited for my primary to return or I started from scratch, and the only pcp available dismissed me even before she entered the exam room!\n\nIf getting a medical discharge and disability status with the military / Veterans' office is as difficult as it is with Social Security, holy moly! \n\nOP, if you read this, I recommend going LC with your family, at minimum. Especially go NC with your sister. She's a judgmental jerk to treat your wife in the manner she does. And going LC with the rest of the family means not only limiting contact to the barest minimum, but also on such an info diet as to be like this: if you think of the info you've been sharing with family up to now has been equivalent to firing rocket boosters on a spaceship launch, you need to give them the equivalent of lighting a match. Go from floods of info to but the barest hint of a drop. Especially anything regarding your wife.\n\nAlso, NTA. Sis wants you present, she must earn it.", "As a fellow spoonie, I will happily make a vinyl iron on with this for you!", "You can make those T-shirts on CafePress.", "OP mentioned she\u2019s enlisted. But you definitely can\u2019t doctor shop in the military. It\u2019s a pain.", "Oh, I didn't realize the system for current members is different from the VA. My brother is in the Army, and he and his wife had a bunch of misdiagnosis happen to them . And a bunch of my relatives alternate between the VA and Indian Health depending on the issue.  Because they both suck but they suck in different ways.", "I'd say it's dampened but not zeroed out. Not taking your family's side and sticking up for your wife is better than a lot of men would do, at least. Maybe good husband +0.5 lol.", "Typical reddit. So easy to say CUT THEM OUT!! Nobody lives in the real world, it seems.", ">, specialists are mostly for rare and/or complicated cases and for doing research\n\nAre you by any chance not American? In the US, \"specialist\" is mostly a term used for insurance purposes, it barely has a medical meaning. If you're on most regular insurances and especially if you're on Medicare or Medicaid, a non-specialist like a clinician or primary care provider absolutely can't call for dialysis in the US, nor any medical procedure besides prescriptions, blood work, and some basic things.\n\nA specialist can be a true specialist, but a lot of them are just second-opinion doctors for insurance purposes, and their job often is literally just to sign off on procedures. I had surgery a few years ago and to get approved I had to go to FOURTEEN different specialists most of whom did nothing but sign forms and write letters.", "I\u2019m sorry to hear that your wife is getting that treatment from your family.", "So, the ***VA*** is the one that lined her up with a rare (and likely difficult to diagnose) condition, and put her into disability. \n\nHaving worked as a caseworker, there was a client who had hurt his spine... *his spine*... while in the military. X-Rays, scans, everything showed the fractures and damage done to his back. The doctors, and the commanding officer both documented the moment the injury occurred, and how it was truly the military at fault. \n\nAnd it was an uphill battle for him to get diagnosed and get disability assistance, with a *very* visible condition, with reams of paperwork and proof. \n\nI can only **imagine** how difficult it was for your wife to get a diagnoses for an \"invisible\" condition such as brain condition. Doctors like to downplay pretty much all neurological conditions, so for the ***VA*** (sorry, I am fully aware of how absolute garbage they can be) to be willing to make this diagnoses... any legitimate doctor should be sitting back in shock, and realize that the ***only way*** that the VA signed off on it... means that there is 1000% more evidence and proof than would be required than for any regular doctor.", "I wouldn't let my wife even hear word one from your family. I wouldn't come around them and I would tell them, in no uncertain terms, why that is. \n\nI hope the best for your wife going forward. Losing yourself to a condition that's hard for your family to even understand while trying to come to terms with your new limitations and questioning your own body's abilities is so frustrating and depressing on its face that I can't imagine having a family who, simply, dismissed it like she's making it up. That would be incredibly detrimental to her mental health and, because of the nature of her condition, possibly detrimental to her ability to function because of the added stress. I'd do everything in my power to avoid people who seek to, either, downplay her condition or outright call her lazy. Never would I ever be around my family under those conditions.", "Being in the navy doesn't mean anything. Maybe she was rubbish, maybe she was brilliant ... I don't know because a job title/industry is not an example of performance. The only performance example provided doesn't paint a flattering picture.", "Being in the military doesn\u2019t mean someone is hard working. You\u2019re drawing conclusions based on\u2026 nothing? Calling out from work to stay on vacation is very shitty behavior.", "Being in the military doesn\u2019t mean someone is hard working. You\u2019re drawing conclusions based on\u2026 nothing? Calling out from work to stay on vacation is very shitty behavior.", "I don't know your wife, I can literally only judge her by what you tell me. In 25 years I've never agreed to do a shift then called out to extend my holiday. That isn't the work ethic I practice, nor is it what I teach my children. I'm not saying your wife is faking her illness, but your only actual example of her working is not showing me a hard working, honourable woman.", "you have, sadly, likely just summed up a great many of the people working in the medical profession.", "Oof", "You have to mourn who you were, who you thought you'd become, and the future you worked for. That was lovely of you to have recommendations to help others with that as a pinned post.\n\nAt 21, I became disabled in a car crash when someone ran a light. The \"what if\" used to eat at me constantly. I fought with everything I had to get better. I once vomited every day for over a year trying to acclimate to a medicine that *might* help, because I desperately wanted to be better.\n\nAfter 10+ years, my goal finally seemed possible. There were just a few oddities that weren't figured out, but felt manageable, and then *BAM,* Multiple Sclerosis. I had to mourn everything all over again.\n\nA lot of people have said \"it must be nice\" to not work. It doesn't bother me the first time, because most change their mind after I patiently help them think it through (no, you don't get to freely enjoy your hobbies \ud83d\ude44). \n\nPeople like OP's family are infuriating. It's not doctor shopping; it's trying to find one that's knowledgeable and believes you (especially when you're a woman). I had one claim the pain was in my head because my father sexually abused me! My dad never even spanked me! Said doctor is thankfully no longer in practice.\n\nSomeone who I thought of as a dear friend that understood my limitations started telling me to apply for jobs she knew were open at her workplace. My dad cut contact with his best friend since boot camp (40+ years) after he said I was manipulating my parents because I just didn't want to work. \n\nIt's incredibly disheartening to have those close to you treat you like you're some kind of deceptive mastermind. Sorry this got so long, I just feel for OP's wife. I hope he starts enforcing some serious boundaries.", "\ud83e\udd23 Thank you! I will have to order one for my next plane trip or family get together!", "You can barely see a Dr for something like that in the military let alone Dr shop.", "Wow. Way to set the bar in hell.", "YOU are not OPs wife. YOU don't have her exact circumstances. YOU work differently because we are all unique\n\nStop holding people to YOUR standards. This post isn't about you. \n\nEmpathy goes a long way. Maybe you should try practising that and teaching your kids that as well.", "You also don\u2019t know where she works or the nature of her schedule. Her schedule literally involves them texting her every morning asking if she can come into work that day for a shift. There is no formal schedule. With her illnesses, she requires work with flexible schedules.", "Ow, that's a truly sucky double-whammy!\n\nI won't say any of the stupid words about you/your situation, but may I say this; huge kudos to your dad for having your back! I'm glad you've got family on board. To him, from a random internet stranger, \ud83c\udfc6.", "The VA system is so broken that it took a very long time to receive a diagnosis. Most people I know go to one of the two VA or Indian Health systems, and I don't know of anyone who received a diagnosis for a neurological disorder there in less than a year.", "If you think THIS is the bar being in hell, then honestly your life is going great, the circle of people around you are awesome, and I don't want to disillusion you of any of that, so I'm gonna just agree with you and say that yes this is the bar in hell and this guy is the bottom of the barrel for sure lol", "Well maybe you should have included that in your post. Currently, the only work example you provide is something I would never do and consider completely inconsistent with a decent work ethic. How am I or anyone else suppose to guess your wife's very unusual work arrangement? I have never in my entire life heard of an arrangement so ad hoc, how does the business even operate without a staff roster.", "You are making excuses because you don\u2019t like the implication of calling out. I don\u2019t believe what you are saying at all. No business operates that way if they expect to stay in business.", "If you think a man half arsing looking after his wife's mental health deserves praise then I'm worried for the state of your life.", "You\u2019ll notice that many people managed not to hyperfixate on the extremely normal choice to not work on a particular day even without that added context. \n\nThe fact that you zeroed in on it and ended up embarrassing yourself is your problem, not OP\u2019s.", "Seriously its delievering packages. Yes you can operate as an on call driver for things like moving packages.", "ok", "They seem cranky this morning.", "It's okay, sometimes people just need to vent a little, and that's fine lol"]}
