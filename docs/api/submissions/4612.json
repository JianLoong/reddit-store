If it is the best school available and a good academic/social for both girls, then they both need to remain.  The teasing should be addressed separately.

Kelly is right, that isn\u2019t fair.  Ariel should be respectful of Kelly.\n\n\nYou and Ariel\u2019s mom and Kelly\u2019s mom need to parent!

This is difficult, a good school is what is best for both girls. \n\nIt is time for all three of the adults here to become better co-parents. The mom's may not like it, however the girls are sisters and the moms are co-parents because of that.\n\nYou need to step up as well about the bullying. I don't care if you found out about is 5 seconds ago. Bullying is never the right behavior and moving schools for the girl being bullied should not be the first response. You need to sit those girls down and have a conversation about this behavior and about the consequences such behavior have. Their moms also need to understand this. \n\nNTA, because you are trying to do what is best for both girls.

She was really quick to demand and insist school change which makes me wonder if Ariel is actually doing any bullying at all nor did she any suggestions on what should be done about the \u201cother kids\u201d who she claims were in on it. It just may be she doesn\u2019t like her half sister encroaching on what she sees as her territory and made something up or exaggerated something that she thought you would consider as a reason for transferring your other daughter. You need to get to the bottom of this. Get the names of the other students. Tell Kelly you intend to call their parents too and call the school. She may change her tune if you seen serious about investigating it outside of your family. Sure, \u201ceverything\u201d may have been better for her when her sister wasn\u2019t around but perhaps that has nothing to do with bullying and more like she is feeling insecure and jealous. \n\nThirdly, if it turns out your other daughter was engaging in bullying behavior, get with her mother and discipline her\u2026but switching schools is something that should be the very last resort, not the first.", "You're not an a****** for not making the other daughter change schools, but your other daughter is definitely being an a******.

Changing schools is not the solution, the solution is for you the parent to stop tour one daughter from bullying the other.", "NTA, unless there are details being left out. You offered a possible solution, you didn't demand it. Pulling either of them seems drastic, but asking Kelly if she wants to change isn't being an AH. \n\nThis is a tough age. Obviously Ariel needs to stop teasing her half sister about this, but she shouldn't have to leave the school. Is Ariel's mom helping out here? Are their teachers aware of this? Do you have consequences in place for Ariel? \n\nIs Kelly actually happy there and was she before Ariel arrived? I mean, it sounds like you are thinking about what's best for Kelly; if she's not suited to a school that's highly focused on academics, is it the best place for her? That doesn't seem to be an unfair question to ask.", "NTA - Switching schools isn\u2019t going to solve the problem. Ariel needs to have some form of consequence for the bullying, and Kate needs more help with her studies. Or possibly finding out if there is another reason she\u2019s struggling. Instead of letting this spiral into something really toxic, use it as a way to teach and connect with your kids.", "NTA. Ariel's mom enrolled her, yes? So you have little to no control over Ariel's attendance there. Kelly has the options of switching schools or dealing with the situation at her current school.\n\nI would alert the school about the bullying and have a talk with Ariel's mom about her behavior. If she is bullying her sister, there should be consequences and ones that both you and her mother are united on, if possible. \n\nBut I'm wondering about a couple things. You said Ariel's mom moved them closer to get her into this school. Have you been spending more time recently with Ariel than you have in the past? Could Kelly be exaggerating things out of jealousy? Her immediate insistence about getting Ariel out of the school seems a bit odd to me. Is bullying something that Ariel has done before?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think you're reading things into this that aren't there. \n\nAcademic performance is highly valued in some private schools, to the point where admin will look the other way when students are getting teased for less than stellar grades. It's part of the culture. It's not healthy, but if Kelly is getting teased for her academic performance and doesn't love the school in general, isn't it worth asking if she wants to go elsewhere? Unless OP is a major donor to the school, he's unlikely to get that to culture to change. Furthermore, one size doesn't fit all when it comes to education. \n\nI was a private school kid. The coursework was intense, we took Algebra II in 8th grade, most students in the US take it in 11th. Across town, my cousin was also in a private school but one that was more arts focused, it suited her well. In many places there are options between college prep, arts, STEM, and good public schools exist. Why keep a kid in a school that is not serving her needs? \n\nI'm really not sure how you managed to get that I'm saying it's fine and dandy for Kelly to be mocked from what I commented above.

Most of them were the quiet sort who weren\u2019t bullying anyone; I think all but one of the ones who weren\u2019t just getting back what they dished out were ESL kids.", "Depends on the school. In some private schools where the focus is academics, the popular kids are often the ones at the top of the honor roll. Most of the kids in this type of school don't have what would be considered a 'normal' teenage social life and being a pretentious AH is kind of the point.

This was apparently not sufficient to be expelled, but if it was, Ariel would automatically be the one to leave. Your other daughter is old enough to understand that just banning her sister from her school is not appropriate punishment, but only if you handle the situation with her sister, take the matter seriously, make sure she does apologise, is punished appropriately and never do it again. On any other condition, it\u2019s not acceptable parenting. And you should encourage both of them to be at least respectful towards each other, they are half sister, it shouldn\u2019t have happened in the first place.\n\nEven if there wasn\u2019t bullying in the equation, she would feel like she was happier when her sister wasn\u2019t there.

But struggling doesn't necessarily mean she's failing, she could still be passing her classes. I don't think it's a reason to have her switch schools.", "What concerns me is that Ariel and her mother instantly believed Kelly, they didn't even check with you to see if this information is correct.  Is there behavior you have exhibited in the past (favoring Kelly at Ariel's expense) that would lead them to believe this?", "And Ariel instantly believed Kelly.  Makes me wonder what kind of father OP is to Ariel that she automatically believes the worst of him.", "Based on all of OP's comments, it seems more like Kelly is the golden child.", "I agree re the switching schools which should be a last resort. There may be some learning disability that has not been addressed. Or maybe they are both mean girls? Either way OP needs to get on top of the behavioral issues ASAP.", "What are you talking about? Kelly told Ariel the exact opposite of what OP told her.", "Oh, absolutely. It doesn't really sound like he's been doing anything to figure out what's going on between his daughters.", "Quote \n I told Kelly that if she really doesn't want to be in that school then we can change her school but she called me an ah and said it's not fair because she was here first.\nUnquote", "What a mess\u2026does Kelly like this school if there are other people besides Ariel making fun of her? If so then yes I see why moving her might be beneficial for her. I\u2019m just impressed your first instinct is to move her and not tell Ariel to leave her alone? I\u2019m inclined to say YTA as a parent\u2026", "op=NTA for not changing schools, A-H for ignoring Ariel's bullying.\n\nYou need to deal with Ariel mocking Kelly.  That is a HUGE problem that you seem to be neglecting.  Get together with your Ex and come up with appropriate consequences.", "YTA. There are more than two options here. This is not immediately apparent to a child. It should be obviously to an adult.", "I\u2019m trying to figure out how you got kids a year apart from two different women? You on that Nick Cannon timing. Do the moms get along? Do the girls generally get along? Do they spend time together? Did you tell Kelly that Ariel was coming and how did she take it? There\u2019s a lot of issues here in this scenario. I\u2019m inclined to say NTA as both kids deserve the best education they can receive, but I think you need to do something to improve the relationships or at least try to make things civil.", "The fact that Kelly's justification for her position is bad (she was there first), that doesn't actually make her wrong (Ariel is a bully). Your idea here is bad.", "Why are you, the adult, taking the child's word that this is the only solution. Can you not discuss this with your other daughter, her mother, school administration, literally do anything or explore any other options", "Kelly is a bully. THere is proof for that (read the comments.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe only indication that ariel could be a bully is kelly's statement. ANd she is KNOWN to lie, OP has proof for that. The parents of other kids and everybody else OP asked contradicts her. (Again, read the comments).", "No. That's not bullying. Get a grip.", "Are you serious? She\u2019s bullying your daughter.. she is a bully", "Kelly is the older child. So Ariel's mom was the one flinging around with a new daddy.", "I agree, but unfortunately I think we can all admit that there are plenty of not decent parents these days.", "They should absolutely care, yes, but it might still be hard to get a parent on board with switching the school they specifically uprooted their lives to get their kid into, and I think that's fair. At the very least, there are quite a few options to try first.", "The reason to switch schools is that SHE does not want to share a school with her halfsister.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n.", "I think its Ariel's mom.", "Kelly told Ariel that Ariel was going to be moved. Not that OP was moving Kelly."]}
