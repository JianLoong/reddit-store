He took care of the house, cleaned his room, did not leave messes, etc. He was an ideal roommate. We were pretty close friends. \n\nHis quad - his girlfriend and he were dating another couple - split up after many years and he decided to go wild. \n\nI would run into him at places and it was never weird. Don\u2019t disrespect me or my house or harm my animals or let them get outside unsupervised. Do your thing, enjoy it. Just please keep any private time or possessions (yours or theirs) in your room. \n\nThere was a designated space in the house for things that needed to leave - amazon returns or a jacket someone left or whatever. Suddenly, things started appearing on it. \n\nThere was a \u201chouse rule\u201d that overnight hookups could not stay more than three nights in a row - there could be sleep disruptions, noise during WFH hours, etc. Eventually, I came to realize that the hook ups were leaving things everywhere. I found medication sitting open on my counter. Food would disappear. Women\u2019s clothing in the guest bath. Piles of towels that were only used once - I literally would wash the linens, put them away, and come home two days after visiting family and ALL OF THEM were damp sitting on the carpet. \n\nThe house rule was put in place because his one night stands would extend - cool, do your thing - but would then start acting like they lived in my house. His bedroom was quite large so there was no reason for this. My private things stayed in my room, only communal use things were elsewhere and any food not allowed to be shared was labeled. My leftovers, packed lunches, etc., would disappear overnight. \n\nI had to care for a friend for a week who had intense surgery. Another friend went to feed my pets and both cats were gone. Inside cats supervised on an enclosed porch. \n\nIt turns out that one of the guests shooed the cats out of the house because she didn\u2019t like them. I caught this on audio from the camera that covered my front yard. They had been gone over 24 hours. This person was the one who started him down the path of disrespect. \n\nI fucking lost it. I left my friend I was caring for, was home in half the normal drive time. He had told me she would be visiting for an overnight and then he was taking her to the airport. \n\nShe had been there the ENTIRE time I was gone and when I demanded that she leave, suddenly suitcases - 5 or 6 - and bags and bags of clothing were being carried out to her car. She had moved in. \n\nI cleared it with the landlord and he gave me permission to kick the guy out. He had 30 days - he was not on the lease but did pay a minimal amount of rent. Landlord also said that if I didn\u2019t want that person there, it was fine to demand she be gone. After she let my cats out because she didn\u2019t like them, the landlord ALSO told him she was not to set foot on the premises. \n\nI left for a week for a work trip the following week. She was given a key by my roommate. She parked around the corner, thinking I would not know when I drove that route on my way home - it was a cul de sac. \n\nI was back less than three hours and found out. I rang my landlord, he said he would be there ASAP, to call the cops, and to record EVERYTHING. \n\nI pitched ALL THEIR SHIT onto the front lawn and the roommate just stood staring at me while she was blowing up and making threats to harm me. I went back into the room and discovered BAGS of rotting food under the bed, in the closets, etc. \n\nCops arrived, asked for proof of eviction, I stated she was not a resident and not on the lease and was squatting. Landlord drives up, shows the lease and explains the verbal agreement for only the roommate to stay. \n\nThe girl came running at me and tried to kick me, she hit my shin and I elbowed her on the way by and yelled for her to stop. She turned around and grabbed me, I threw her ass down and popped her twice in the mouth. She pulled a knife and was yelling she would fuck up my face.  Cop got me off her, arrested her, etc. \n\nLandlord had to remodel the entire room and pay for pest infestation. She had also punched holes in the walls behind all of my art and broken an heirloom piece of handmade furniture from my grandfather. \n\nShe went to court, roommate went to court, landlord won his suits, she had to do jail time and also rehab because apparently she was doing drugs and leaving exposed needles under the carpet. \n\nI eventually moved a year later - to another house of the same landlord because he was great - and I am now on a lease with the intent to own. \n\nTLDR: roommate hooked up with a crazy chick, she moved herself into my house, endangered my pets, tried to assault me when I threw them out.", "NTA.

Even if a place is named university - it's still referenced as college in the United States. \n\nOP referenced everything as college vs you referencing everything as university. Which is why I assumed you were quoting laws from either Europe or Canada vs OP being US based.", "> And he knew it was the owner of the house?

She is endangering your property and potentially your life. This is quite a bit different than someone bringing people they are dating home - presumably most people exercise some degree of caution and don't bring people they have just met in a bar into their homes\n\n2) She is bringing people home frequently and they are disturbing your comfort in your home. This is a trickier thing to navigate since once you have a roommate you do give up the right to have absolute privacy. I would never live with a roommate because I want to know when I am home only people I have invited into my space will be there and I am lucky so that I can afford my privacy.", "I had a roommate very similar to your example.. it got ridiculous and since it was HER house, I just moved out while she was at work.. she had the habit of even tho we were supposed to split the electric bill 50/50, she didn't pay her half but I did.. and after a couple months I got to noticing the \"current amount\" and the \"past due\" amount.. so I reduced my input to half the current amount and oooo she complained when a shutoff warning was sent.. until I pointed out the past due amount not getting paid and waved my receipts under her nose...", ">StoneAgePrue  \n>  \n>Soooo, your boyfriend can come over multiple times a week, but she can only have a guy over one night a week?

You could also do smaller things like separate your coffee mugs even if on different shelves so she can say things to guests like \u201conly use cups from the bottom shelf, those are mine\u201d.
