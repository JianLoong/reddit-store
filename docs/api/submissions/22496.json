He took care of the house, cleaned his room, did not leave messes, etc. He was an ideal roommate. We were pretty close friends. \n\nHis quad - his girlfriend and he were dating another couple - split up after many years and he decided to go wild. \n\nI would run into him at places and it was never weird. Don\u2019t disrespect me or my house or harm my animals or let them get outside unsupervised. Do your thing, enjoy it. Just please keep any private time or possessions (yours or theirs) in your room. \n\nThere was a designated space in the house for things that needed to leave - amazon returns or a jacket someone left or whatever. Suddenly, things started appearing on it. \n\nThere was a \u201chouse rule\u201d that overnight hookups could not stay more than three nights in a row - there could be sleep disruptions, noise during WFH hours, etc. Eventually, I came to realize that the hook ups were leaving things everywhere. I found medication sitting open on my counter. Food would disappear. Women\u2019s clothing in the guest bath. Piles of towels that were only used once - I literally would wash the linens, put them away, and come home two days after visiting family and ALL OF THEM were damp sitting on the carpet. \n\nThe house rule was put in place because his one night stands would extend - cool, do your thing - but would then start acting like they lived in my house. His bedroom was quite large so there was no reason for this. My private things stayed in my room, only communal use things were elsewhere and any food not allowed to be shared was labeled. My leftovers, packed lunches, etc., would disappear overnight. \n\nI had to care for a friend for a week who had intense surgery. Another friend went to feed my pets and both cats were gone. Inside cats supervised on an enclosed porch. \n\nIt turns out that one of the guests shooed the cats out of the house because she didn\u2019t like them. I caught this on audio from the camera that covered my front yard. They had been gone over 24 hours. This person was the one who started him down the path of disrespect. \n\nI fucking lost it. I left my friend I was caring for, was home in half the normal drive time. He had told me she would be visiting for an overnight and then he was taking her to the airport. \n\nShe had been there the ENTIRE time I was gone and when I demanded that she leave, suddenly suitcases - 5 or 6 - and bags and bags of clothing were being carried out to her car. She had moved in. \n\nI cleared it with the landlord and he gave me permission to kick the guy out. He had 30 days - he was not on the lease but did pay a minimal amount of rent. Landlord also said that if I didn\u2019t want that person there, it was fine to demand she be gone. After she let my cats out because she didn\u2019t like them, the landlord ALSO told him she was not to set foot on the premises. \n\nI left for a week for a work trip the following week. She was given a key by my roommate. She parked around the corner, thinking I would not know when I drove that route on my way home - it was a cul de sac. \n\nI was back less than three hours and found out. I rang my landlord, he said he would be there ASAP, to call the cops, and to record EVERYTHING. \n\nI pitched ALL THEIR SHIT onto the front lawn and the roommate just stood staring at me while she was blowing up and making threats to harm me. I went back into the room and discovered BAGS of rotting food under the bed, in the closets, etc. \n\nCops arrived, asked for proof of eviction, I stated she was not a resident and not on the lease and was squatting. Landlord drives up, shows the lease and explains the verbal agreement for only the roommate to stay. \n\nThe girl came running at me and tried to kick me, she hit my shin and I elbowed her on the way by and yelled for her to stop. She turned around and grabbed me, I threw her ass down and popped her twice in the mouth. She pulled a knife and was yelling she would fuck up my face.  Cop got me off her, arrested her, etc. \n\nLandlord had to remodel the entire room and pay for pest infestation. She had also punched holes in the walls behind all of my art and broken an heirloom piece of handmade furniture from my grandfather. \n\nShe went to court, roommate went to court, landlord won his suits, she had to do jail time and also rehab because apparently she was doing drugs and leaving exposed needles under the carpet. \n\nI eventually moved a year later - to another house of the same landlord because he was great - and I am now on a lease with the intent to own. \n\nTLDR: roommate hooked up with a crazy chick, she moved herself into my house, endangered my pets, tried to assault me when I threw them out.", "NTA.

Tenant law does not apply.  \n\nThe renter wouldn\u2019t even have the traditional landlord/tenant tribunal (which heavily favour tenants) available to settle disputes.   They\u2019d have to take the landlord to small claims court to seek damages.", "You can\u2019t be a tenant if you don\u2019t have exclusive possession - they are a lodger not a tenant. Lodgers have different rules.", "Where I live, definitely not. If you are renting a room in a home you share with the landlord, they can set whatever rules they like and can kick you out at any time.  The law says you must be given a reasonable amount of time, but does not actually specify the exact amount.", "She sounds like a \"boarder\" not a normal tenant. And in most places, the laws are definitely different on the rights of boarders or tenants.", "You would be assuming wrong because this isn\u2019t a co-tenant relationship.  \n\nUnder the law (where I live) the renter is essentially considered a guest in the landlord\u2019s home. \n\nOP doesn\u2019t need to apply any rules to her boyfriend, if she doesn\u2019t wish to (especially if nothing has fundamentally changed in OP\u2019s boyfriend\u2019s presence/use of the common areas).", "unless there's a separate kitchen in the tenant's bedroom, the kitchen is a communal space, and op cannot realistically keep her tenant or the tenants guest out.", "It\u2019s likely THEIR kitchen. Yes she is the owner of the house, but when she rented a room, she opened it up to use by someone else. Unless the lease limited access to communal areas like the kitchen, the roommate likely has the right to use it, including her guests. The roommate may be an A H, but is likely not doing anything illegal that could be acted upon. The OP chose to rent space in their house. The consequence of which is that the OP no longer has total control and authority over the space. OP can ask for a change in behavior, but beyond that it\u2019s into ending the lease and/or beginning an eviction process.", "There\u2019s a fair chance it wouldn\u2019t be legal to include that language anyways. Having guests beyond an extended time may be ok, and OP might have some legal protection since they live there, but usually a tenant has the right to use their personal space as they wish and to have guests in the shared space. I don\u2019t think it would be ok to include some parameter for how long you\u2019ve known someone. \n\nThis is pretty much exclusively the realm of polite conversation between roommates: communication and expectations. Safety is a legitimate concern and should have been mutually agreed upon before living together.", "It really depends on OP\u2019s location. In some places, lodgers have very limited rights when compared to tenants renting an entire house.", "As I said,\n\n>You should have a conversation about her guests not using your personal property (ie your coffee mug, etc) and that you'd prefer her guests not be in the common areas without her.", "Getting coffee in a shared space as a guest is out of control? Lol", "It\u2019s not in the lease, so the landlord can only ask and make reasonable requests.", "You're going to say that people living with roommates don't hook up? \ud83d\ude02", "Boundaries should be clearly outlined in any written agreement/contract.  Leaving it open to interpretation with words such as \u201cwithin reason\u201d clouds it.

PERIOD!", "Source? If you\u2019re renting someone with an agreement in place, you are a tenant.", "What state/ country are you in? Because the moment a lease is signed the landlord loses a lot of rights over most property", "Yes however all tenants have a right to \u201cuse and enjoy\u201d the property within reason. Having people over though out the week likely falls in that", "if her tenant is considered a guest, then I guess op shouldn't be expecting rent. the idea that your tenant is not given the same basic rights just because you also live there is ridiculous.", "This is all well & good, except OP drew up a contract that specified guests were allowed, granting rights OP's tenant may not have otherwise had (obv this is all jurisdiction dependent)", "Everything I\u2019ve seen says the opposite.\n\nIf there is a lease agreement in place without that restriction explicitly stated, they have access to common areas.\n\nThey are essentially roommates even tho one is the landlord.", "I mean I think the realistic thing to do would be to have a conversation with the tenant. If they get along well I\u2019m sure that they can reach some sort of agreement", "Tenant should be accompanying her guests in communal spaces, though.  That way she can at least attempt to monitor the behavior of the gross strangers she brings into another woman's home.", "That doesn't matter here, bc OP stated that they have a contract that specifically allows guests within reason. \n\nmaybe OP can try and get the contract voided, but I'm guessing OP enjoys some of the protections in said contract.", "She isn\u2019t a Lodger, she is a tenant if they have a lease agreement in place", "\u201c in the contract it says she can have friends/guests over within reason.\u201d", "Except OP literally states in the first few sentences that it\u2019s actually in the lease\n\nr/readingishard", "No they do because I bring home hookups (sad singles club for 5+ years lol) but I (get to) know them to some degree and it happens 1-2 a month at max, I\u2019m just saying the complete rando you know nothing about is too much imo", "It's reasonable to expect your roommate not to have someone staying over 3--4 times a week. That's literally half the time.", "Canada, B.C.\n\nIf a tenant shares a bathroom or cooking facilities with the owner, none of the protections apply.", "I find it interesting you keep saying your interpretation of \u201cuse and enjoy\u201d trumps laws of the various jurisdictions people are mentioning. It\u2019s a fact that landlord tenant laws vary in different jurisdictions.", "I don\u2019t know that the laws are where you are from, but in where I live, it\u2019s pretty straightforward. \n\nThis is why a lot Universities provide detailed guidance for students thinking about this kind of accommodation, as they aren\u2019t protected by the robust laws that govern proper rentals. \n\nYou can certainly disagree with it, but that\u2019s how it works.", "Right. The lease literally says she IS allowed to have friends/guests over. Unless it's specifically spelled out what \"within reason\" means, she's not violating anything about the lease to have a single guest spend the night. If she had a boyfriend and that boyfriend were spending the night as often as her hookups, I highly doubt there'd be a problem. Which means the tenant is acting within reason.", "So she can't have one night stands as often as she wants?\n\nI get not letting them use the kitchen. But her bedroom is her bedroom. That's what you risk by renting a room where you live.", "What\u2019s normal for the spider is chaos for the fly.", "That sounds kinda like a nightmare ngl, in this case I see where the land lord is coming from to a degree but that sounds very abusible", "There's a big difference between a boyfriend who is obviously around long term that the landlord would have a chance to get to know and ONS or random hook ups.", "Except you have no clue what you are on about and a tenants landlord in a shared space can establish new rules as they please \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\n\nThese rules don\u2019t even have to be on the lease, there just needs to be a written notice:)", "Well of course you\u2019re gonna have a hard time \u201eenforcing\u201c that, but I would consider it pretty standard for roommates that want to live together and respect each others space\u2026", "Sounds like OP wrote a bad contract then", "Why does the landlord need to know everyone the tenant brings over?", "Not legally there isn\u2019t if it\u2019s not defined in the contract.", "If it's not part of the lease, it's not legally binding. The landlord can't just make up new rules on the fly and expect them to be enforced because they wrote them down.", "If she tells them not to use the kitchen (the bathroom must be allowed) then it's her room, her space. How often is acceptable? 1 per day? 1 per week? 1 per month? It will depend from person to person.", "When you live in the home and have shared spaces with the landlord then common decency and respect means you at least let your landlord know someone is coming over. It's the bringing randos home from the bar that is causing the issue. Seeing as OP aka the landlord doesn't feel safe with this new situation, she has every right to bring it up with her tenet. If the tenet doesn't like it she can find new housing.

Why don\u2019t you just shit your mouth when it comes to things you clearly don\u2019t know the first thing about?:)", "That may hold for some people but the reason why I commented is because I disagree with your very hard judgment, I don\u2019t think OP should be TA because 1) she hasn\u2019t even said anything yet and 2) you agree that it is within reason to have some requirements (that OP can calmly voice) and I don\u2019t think having requirements make you an AH and 3) may I ask if you\u2019re by any chance male? Maybe I\u2019m presumptuous here but a lot of the other comments agree with my line of thinking about safety requirements, and you never what kind of urges a drunk random man could follow, imagine he goes to the bathroom, goes back - wrong door - finds a different but \u201cohhh she\u2019s pretty\u201c female and r**** her.", "Tenant have rights, too. They can't just be arbitrarily kicked out because the landlord doesn't like something.

It depends on where they live.", "Educate yourself instead of talking out of your ass lmao", "Haha lol ok so I was presumptuous but then I don\u2019t really get why you don\u2019t have these safety concerns\u2026 maybe you are one of the very lucky few that never had to experience anything herself but every single female friend I know would agree with me about strange men in their homes."]}
