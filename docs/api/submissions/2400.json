I have my daughter every two weeks for the weekend because I work but I'm a very active father. I buy her clothes and pay for extra curricular activities.\n\nLast weekend when Rachel was staying over I noticed her phone on the counter and wanting to make sure my girl was being safe online and not talking to boys I went through her phone. When I went through her contacts I noticed that Elizabeth's new husband's contact was listed as \"Dad\".\n\nElizabeth has only been married to this guy for 3 years so obviously I felt that this was inappropriate, especially since I am Rachel's legal father, my name is on the birth certificate. I chose not to talk to Rachel about it at the time and waited till Elizabeth came by to pick her up to say anything.\n\nI asked Elizabeth if she thought it was appropriate for Rachel to be calling her step dad \"dad\". But Elizabeth said it was our girl's choice and the reason im not listed as dad is because she only sees me every two weeks. I yelled at Elizabeth for not correcting our daughter and they both left shortly after that.\n\nNow my daughter isn't answering my texts and I'm thinking her mom has something to do with it.\nAita for yelling at my Ex?.\n\nTldr: Yelled at my Ex for not correcting our daughter.", "created_utc": 1668540737, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yw75ur/aita_for_yelling_at_my_ex/", "score": 406, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Let us count the ways: \n\n1. \" I have my daughter every two weeks for the weekend because I work but I'm a very active father. I buy her clothes and pay for extra curricular activities.\" Hahaha. No. That's not active parenting. That's not parenting at all. Paying for your child's clothing and extra curriculars is a minimal expectation of having a child, not parenting. \n2. \"Elizabeth has only been married to this guy for 3 years so obviously I felt that this was inappropriate...\" Not obvious to most people, no. It's completely appropriate for an 8 year old who has been living with her stepfather since she was 5 to call him \"dad.\" It's ridiculous that you'd think she wouldn't, really. \n3. \" I yelled at Elizabeth for not correcting our daughter\" You yelled at your ex in front of your daughter. Strike three, man, but well done reinforcing to your ex and your daughter that you belong in the \"ex\" column. If you never want your daughter to think of you as \"dad,\" you're doing a great job.", "YTA.. your daughter is 8.. it\u2019s not malicious for her to think of her step dad as dad.. \n\nInfo: do you pay for the phone?", "This is fake...right? Okay, I'll bite.\n\nAre you familiar with the concept of 50/50 custody? It's this nifty thing where each parents get 50% of their child's time. A super cool thing about this is even busy, working parents can still do it! That way you have more time to foster a parental relationship! I know it sounds too good to be true but lots of parents do it.\n\nSarcasm aside, it takes a lot of nerve to be too \"busy\" for more than every other weekend and still be upset your child doesn't view you as \"dad\". Get over yourself. If her step...DAD has been so impactful in her life that she feels comfortable calling him dad, good for them.\n\nYTA.", "YTA. \n\nIt\u2019s your daughter\u2019s choice what she calls her stepdad. You get zero say in it.", "YTA. You sound petty and jealous. 3 years is a long time for an 8 year old. Your daughter is old enough to decide what she calls the people in her life. Maybe you're not as involved as you think you are if she feels that way.", "Your daughter decides who she wants to call dad. Even if you or your ex made her change the name in the phone, it won't change who she feels in her heart is her dad now, and to make her feel shitty about that sucks, big time. You should have left this issue alone.\n\nYTA", "Legality doesn't make you a dad. Neither does only spending four days a month with your daughter because you're too busy with work to make the time (despite millions of parents who work fulltime jobs and still spend daily time with their kids).\n\nYour daughter's not talking to you because you snooped on her phone and then demanded her mother make her stop calling her stepdad \"dad\" because your feelings were hurt, not because her mother told her not to. YTA", "Working full time does not mean you can\u2019t spend more time with your daughter. Do you seriously think that full time parents don\u2019t work full time jobs? You\u2019re clearly NOT an involved parent and your comments prove that.\n\nIn this story alone, you\u2019ve shown your daughter that she has no privacy by going through her phone, that she lacks autonomy by saying she can\u2019t decide to call her stepfather dad, and that it\u2019s okay to yell at her mother for providing a loving and safe home. \n\nYTA.", "YTA so let me get this straight, you went through your 8 year olds phone to make sure she \u201cwasn\u2019t talking to boys\u201d that\u2019s weird, she\u2019s 8. \n\nher stepdad, who she spends a majority of her weeks with, is listed as Dad. instead of being a calm, reasonable adult about it, you waited until your ex came for pick up, and then you yelled at her about it. she told you it was your daughters choice, you yelled at her for not \u201ccorrecting\u201d her. now your daughter isn\u2019t responding to you, and you think her mom has something to do with it, not maybe that you yelling at her mom about her calling her stepdad dad, having anything to do with it. \n\n> told her to be a better mother since she\u2019s a huge failure. \n \nLMAO ironic coming from you", "YTA.\n\nironic that you think it's your ex that's the huge failure.", "YTA\n\nif she thought of you as Dad, she would label your contact so.  Maybe 4 days a month is not enough for her.  \n\nwhy don't you have 50/50?", "YTA and you need to apologize to your ex and daughter.  Take this as a wake up call that you need to foster a better relationship with your daughter.  Anyone with the requisite anatomy can father a child but you have to earn being called Dad.  Good luck and hope you figure this out before it\u2019s too late.", "YTA, I understand you\u2019re upset. It really can feel like a stab through the back. I understand your daughter is young so you may even feel like your ex and her husband may be taking advantage of her. However if we\u2019re to take what your ex said about the phone at face value, it doesn\u2019t seem like she had much input on it at all. \n\nEither way, in the larger picture shouldn\u2019t it be a good thing that your daughter has a good enough relationship with her step dad to the point where she\u2019ll also call him dad..?? If your daughter was present when you yelled at your ex for this I can imagine she\u2019d feel very conflicted over one of her dads being upset at the other/and her mother. \n\nFurthermore, just because you \u201cprovide\u201d for your child does not mean you are owed anything. You don\u2019t buy her clothes or spend time with her because you want to flaunt your title as a \u201cDad\u201d to the world. You do it because you love her as a person and want to create that father-daughter bond. It\u2019s okay to feel hurt and upset by this. But this isn\u2019t anyone\u2019s \u201cfault.\u201d Your daughter is lucky to have not 1 but 2 present dads in her life. If I were you I\u2019d take the time to calm down, really think about WHY I\u2019m upset, and then try to look at it objectively. Doing this with this situation and others that happen in life should help you zoom out and gain a better outlook on the situation. You may find that sometimes your gut reaction can be an emotional and silly one. \n\nAt the end of the day if you do still feel uncomfortable about the contact thing, you can talk to your daughter yourself and explain that while you aren\u2019t mad or upset at her, it hurt your feelings to see that you weren\u2019t listed as Dad in her phone. Then maybe you and your daughter can come to a compromise you\u2019re both satisfied with. Like, you listed as \u201cDad\u201d and your ex\u2019s husband as \u201cStep Dad\u201d or \u201cDad #2\u201d lol \n\nSo calm down, you are not in any way less of your daughter\u2019s father than \u201cRick\u201d is. It might feel that way but it\u2019s not, as long as you try your best to be involved and build a HEALTHY (I can\u2019t emphasize that part enough) relationship with your daughter- she\u2019ll always see you as her Dad.", "YTA. Your ex has been married to her new husband for 3 years, so assuming they dated for a year before they were married, that\u2019s about 4 years this man has been in your daughters life. Not only is this half of her life, it\u2019s in some very formative years. Does it suck for you that someone that\u2019s not you is filling that role? Yeah, maybe, but it doesn\u2019t give you the right to scold your ex for allowing her daughter to call the man who acts as her father and that she spends 90% of her time with dad as well.", "Re-read everything you just wrote, from the phone snooping to the bragging about doing the absolute barest minimum (buying clothing), to straight up ambushing your child and her mom with a petty fight, and you might understand why your daughter is calling someone else dad.

Your daughter made a choice, same as you did.", "Let me get this straight you are \u201cDad\u201d to her approximately 15% of the time and you\u2019re surprised she calls the person who\u2019s there 85% of the time Dad. She gets to choose who she feels close to and I\u2019m sorry but legally being a Dad doesn\u2019t mean you are emotionally.\n\nYTA, rather than being insecure about your daughter calling someone else Dad, be thankful she has someone else in her life that\u2019s so supportive. Maybe work on your relationship with her rather than trying to change her relationship with other people.\n\nEdit - the situation is worse than I initially thought, you were completely absent from your daughter\u2019s life for 4 years\u2026 of course she\u2019s closer to her Stepdad.", "So lemme get this straight\n\nYou go away for 5 years and only call her. \nYou return only to see her every two weeks...on weekends???? And you're surprised she sees a man who she's seen consistently and lived with for longer as her dad? Then you say \"WELL I MADE HER.

If she chooses to put step-dad in her phone as \"dad\" then that quite likely speaks to the quality and quantity of your parenting more than anything else. It is not up to you or your ex to control if she calls step-dad \"dad\" or not, so none of your actions are justified here.\n\nAlso, you are snooping through your 8 year old daughter's phone to make sure she isn't \"talking to boys\"? Wtf man...", "YTA\n\nWhy would she correct the child when the child did nothing wrong? You are hurt and jealous- you should admit that. If the child feels this person is more of a father because of his presence, then you need to step it up. See her more often, do more things with her, be more present in her life. She probably heart you yell at her mom and now that are both upset over something innocent. Do you work every weekend too? If not, then start taking her more weekends. Do some things after school. Then you wouldn't have this issue.", "The weekend, every 2 weeks, buying her clothes, and paying for extra curricular activities does not an \u2018active father\u2019 make. Do you attend her extra activities? School plays? Call her every day? She sees her stepdad every day and obviously loves him. He most likely loves her. This. Is. A. Good. Thing. This should not be a competition. Co parenting doesn\u2019t need to be difficult. Examine exactly what your relationship is with your daughter and do better. YTA for blaming your ex first", "YTA.  What an absolute shit communicator you are. It's totally understandable that you were upset by this discovery.  What's not okay is acting out in anger in front of your 8-year-old.  Your kid did absolutely nothing wrong. \n\nYou were out of line.  If you truly care about your daughter then you need to initiate the healing process by apologizing to her and to her stepdad. In fact, invite your daughter and her stepdad to lunch or something. Bond with both. \n\nNotice how I'm leaving your ex-wife out of it....

A dad is someone who invests time into his childrens lives and shows them love by being there. You're an absent father, at best. It seems like your daughter views her stepdad as more of a father because he is there and invests in her. Its not inappropriate at all. They've been married 3 years, which means your daughter was 5. Then they dated before that for what a year, or more. So your daughter has known her step dad at least half her life. He's a dad to her.", "YTA.

It means actually being a part of her life.\n\nEdit: Although props for at least not being a deadbeat dad who skips on child support but... yeah.", "YTA. Your ex has nothing to correct.

Unfortunately money and things are far less important than love and time spent together. I understand that you might work a lot, but that isn't really something you can tell as an excuse for spending so little time together. You might buy her things but you are emotionally unavailable most of the time and this is more important. No child remembers what sneakers they had when little. But they certainly remember things they did together (or in your case DIDN'T do together) with their parents. My parents worked long days when I was a kid. Me and my sis basically saw them before we went to sleep. I know we had a big tv and nice clothes but what I remember more, is that other kids went trips with their parents and played ball outside at evenings with them.

If so talk about more weekends, more dad and daughter nights or overnights (but for example, if she likes her room at her mom\u2019s place and her school, stick to just nights). Take her to play dates, go to her concerts or sports, plan events. Show up. Talk to her. Show her space when she requests it. Cook with her. Eat with her. Etc.

Parenting is a team sport. This includes having her step dad be an active part in her life. You need to come to terms with the fact that both of you may be considered her father, for ever. As others have said, she was only 3-5 when they met-married-ish.\n\nFinally you also need to respect your daughter\u2019s privacy. She is becoming an adolescent. Trust is earned. Not taken.

I have my daughter every two weeks for the weekend because I work but I'm a very active father. I buy her clothes and pay for extra curricular activities.\n\nLast weekend when Rachel was staying over I noticed her phone on the counter and wanting to make sure my girl was being safe online and not talking to boys I went through her phone. When I went through her contacts I noticed that Elizabeth's new husband's contact was listed as \"Dad\".\n\nElizabeth has only been married to this guy for 3 years so obviously I felt that this was inappropriate, especially since I am Rachel's legal father, my name is on the birth certificate. I chose not to talk to Rachel about it at the time and waited till Elizabeth came by to pick her up to say anything.\n\nI asked Elizabeth if she thought it was appropriate for Rachel to be calling her step dad \"dad\". But Elizabeth said it was our girl's choice and the reason im not listed as dad is because she only sees me every two weeks. I yelled at Elizabeth for not correcting our daughter and they both left shortly after that.\n\nNow my daughter isn't answering my texts and I'm thinking her mom has something to do with it.\nAita for yelling at my Ex?.\n\nTldr: Yelled at my Ex for not correcting our daughter.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But there is another type of cost you should be looking at:  Opportunity costs.  You are spending time do other things that you could be spending building a relationship with your daughter.  You are going to have to weigh those costs over time.  \n\nYou are also going to have a to take a good hard look at yourself:  Do you want a relationship with her because you love her and want what is best for her?  or do want her to love and respect you because you are the sperm donor?   The only hope you have for a truly loving and respectful relationship is if you give her that first.  It is not something you can buy with money or because you knocked her mom up.   If you just want a relationship on your terms, then give it up.  You will hurt her and frustrate yourself--and neither of you will win.

He is in her life way more than OP is.", "Just saying what happened with my cousins ex.. he got in trouble for looking through the phones he didn\u2019t pay for.\nbut he doesn\u2019t have a right to dictate what she has her stepfather under in her phone, or blow up on her mother for not making her change it.\n\nOP is a part time dad with only 4 days a month. Step dad is a full time fatherly role.", "So they cover 1/2 of expenses and 90% of the time with her\n\nyou cover 1/2 of expenses and 10% of the time.  \n\nAre you even sure you cover 1/2?  \n\nMost child support barely covers before-and-after school care, much less 1/2.", "Ok you cover 50% but spend what...20% of your time with her? Are you really not seeing your own short comings?", "So basically you missed out on 5 years of her life and you\u2019re upset that the guy she sees everyday is who she considers dad?", "It's exactly the point.  Parents work and still manage to be active in their kids lives.  Instead of trying to defend yourself to everyone maybe try to actually learn from what people are telling you and do better.", "You can't buy love, bro. YTA", "**Your financial contribution does not equal the love you\u2019ll receive from your daughter.**\n\nYou can\u2019t provide for her emotional needs because you are not there. It sucks (for everyone) but that\u2019s what happens with divorce. \n\nYou can either work with her step-dad and provide a bigger, loving family for your daughter. Or you can be bitter and angry, she\u2019ll eventually get sick of being caught in the middle and cut contact with *you*. \n\nMake the right choice.", "That doesn't mean anything", "Do that include the roof of her head? The travel costs? the food? Or is it just her activities and clothes?", "An 8 year old doesn\u2019t equate an adult\u2019s financial responsibility with love, homie. Neither do most rational human beings. YTA, big time.", "So after disappearing for 5 years, you spend 4 days a month with her but do not understand why she considers some other dude her dad.", ">e been an absent father. Rachel hasn't seen you and doesn't have the relationship with you that she has with her step dad. You moved away when she was 2 and came back 2 years ago so she was 6...you were gone 4 years. How much did you see her in those 4 years? Child support does NO\n\nLol, phone calls with toddlers.", "This one is hard, man. I think the best move is to be happy that your daughter has so many loving and attentive adults in her life and be determined to be one of those adults. Stressing over who gets called \u201cdad\u201d isn\u2019t a useful thing to focus on. Thinking about ways to foster best possible relationship long term is better.", "I  wonder why she kicked you out.. just kidding, I have a good idea on why.", "no it's not. you chose to move away to be closer to \"family\". what about your CHILD? she is your family. you actually moved AWAY from family and blaming other people for her not seeing you as family when you just up and left to seek out more important family.", "INFO: why were you kicked out?", "YTA, but you can change that  If you want to be called dad you have to be present. 50/50 custody, daily phone calls, go to events, doctor's appointments, know her interests, likes and dislikes. Working is not an excuse. I'm sure Rick works too, and he's been called dad. And stop yelling at people in front of your daughter.", "Did she kick you out of the state? She ended the relationship, she us not obligated to stay in a relationship with you, your decision to move away from your daughter was yours, you made it.", "You could have stayed local?\nI separated from my daughters dad and I stayed in the same country, city, and barrio as him in order to maintain a 50/50 dynamic.\n\nMoving back to your family was your choice, resulting in you losing years of your daughter growing up, that's on you.", "You're the one that made the decision to move back home to a whole other state. She didn't force you to move that far away. That was your choice.", "You were 30. Why did you not simply get a new property near to your infant child?", "You know why you were kicked out. This is all irrelevant at this point. You have done nothing more then you should have in paying child support. This is equivalent to Rachel saying she cooked dinner and took her shopping. This is all part of providing for your child. \n\nNow you are back and trying to reestablish a relationship with her? Good for you. DONT do this by taking away from the relationships she already has. If you do this unselfishly, she may consider herself lucky that she has two dads in her life. GIVE! DONT TAKE.", "You were cheating. Of course she was going to kick your ass out", "No it\u2019s really not. No matter the reason for the breakup plenty of fathers working full time do 50/50 splits for young children. Parenting more than two days a fortnight is hard but you make it work. Contributing financially is the bare minimum easiest thing you could do.", "N O P E", "Ahh so you don\u2019t have a good argument so you\u2019re just going to insult me. Someone\u2019s upset he\u2019s getting called out for dating children", "OP also states in another comment he was absent from her life for 4 years between the ages of 2-6 years\u2026.", ">Predatory\n\nRidiculous and incredibly infantilizing. 20 year olds are capable of making adult choices.", "Relax with the predatory she's 20 very much an adult and he was 26, not everything is a fucking age issue lmao. The dude just sucks as a dad but no need to toss all three labels", "Youre correct,  she does have that right. He also has the right to get pissed about it and ask the mother.", "Where was I supposed to go after Elizabeth kicked me out? The homeless shelter?.\n\nShe spent all my savings and I had to beg my parents to buy me a plane ticket back to my home state.", "Because she spent all the money in my account", "What?! This is huge!!", "Four years is literally half her life. Half her life she\u2019s gone, then he shows up four days a month for the last tow years and he wonders why she doesn\u2019t think of him as her dad??", "He had the right to have a civil discussion with her.. but he didn\u2019t like her answer and turned nasty real quick.. he even told her that she was a bad mother.. at least Elizabeth can say she has always been in her kids life. OP can\u2019t say that.", "He may have the right to be pissed and yell about it, but that does not mean it's the best way to handle it.\n\nThis subreddit isn't about who has the \"right\" to do something.

Having the \"right\" has nothing to do with it.", "Oh, FFS, what are you, 17? You're a grown-ass man who whines and throws a hissy fit because the child he pays others to raise doesn't see him as a father. Grow the fuck up - if you actually want to be a father, start acting like one, it's not too late to do right by her.\n\nOr you'll lose her when she's old enough to cut you off.", "Could you have begged your parents to give you the money to pay for first months deposit in a new place? Ask a friend to crash at their place for a couple of weeks? As surely you had a job. Unless Elizabeth was the one supporting you and the house was hers, hence how she was able to kick you out and you were left with no options?", "That makes no sense at all", "Is that how she would describe the situation? Because that doesn\u2019t sound like a real reason.", "Right? So how can it be a surprise she calls the other guy Dad!", "Honestly, every single comment from OP oozes with lack of responsibility!", "He has the right to get pissed and say whatever the fuck he wants.. and he is in the kids life. Just because he gets a couple weekends a month does not mean he has no rights to be angry. Give your head a shake.", "Burrrnnn", "We were on a break, i brought someone home and she spent the money in my bank account and kicked me out.", "Yea your rights to get up on your high horse are somewhat diminished by parenting an 8th of the month \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "If he keeps it up, he may not have any weekends with his kid.", "It was in the presence of his daughter.

Info- has anyone ever brought up the topic of boundary issues? Someone with respect for people other than themselves would be more considerate, but based on responses, you don't seem to often think of the emotional needs of others.
