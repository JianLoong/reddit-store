{"id": 32095, "submission_id": "187yvt6", "title": "AITA for straightening my hair?", "selftext": "(\\*repost with correct word count on my lurker account for obvious reasons\\*)\n\nI've (31F) been with with my partner for almost three years, he's white and I am mixed.  We went on vacation with his family over Thanksgiving- note: his family has never seen my natural hair texture (JLo's natural 90s curls) as I straighten it once a week. After showering, his family was complimenting my natural hair and my SIL (33F) who is Black stated that I should leave my natural texture as that is \"how God intended for us Black girls to be\". I corrected her and said that I am mixed and choose not to identify more with one side of my heritage than the other as I come from two beautiful halves to make me whole.\n\n(Background: SIL is a social worker. She is very vocal about cultural trauma, reparations, etc and frequently seeks to make these the sole topics of every conversation she is a part of from what I have witnessed.)\n\nOn Sunday, I was straightening my hair when her daughter (5F) came in ask me what I was doing. I told her and she informed me that her mom had banned any use of heat tools in their house. I said that there was no need for her to use heat tools as her hair was beautiful the way it is. She then she asked me to straighten hers to see what it would look like; I told her that since her mom had banned heat tools, I wasn't comfortable straightening her hair without asking but that her mom was welcomed to use my tools and products if she wished it.We went back downstairs and her request was met with a VERY firm no from her mom, though her dad (36M) said it was fine to do it just once to see. This started an argument between them and some input from the family before my niece had a meltdown from everything happening and her mom took her upstairs to calm her down. She came back downstairs alone and said that she'd \"settled everything\" and we could all go back to the movie.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward to Monday when I am packing up my stuff and I can't find my flat iron, tension comb or heat products. I went downstairs to ask if anybody had moved them and my niece happily announced that her and her mom had thrown them away as they weren't necessary. I saw red but before I could say anything my partner, his brother and their parents all basically started shouting at her for throwing away my things.  She tried to argue with them for a minute, but by that time my niece was crying with all of the adults arguing and her mom picked her up to leave the kitchen, but not before telling me \"this entire thing is your fault\".\n\nWe all left separately, but its been made clear by my other half's parents that she is not welcome on any further vacations or family gatherings until she apologizes. My partner and his family are fervently on my side but a few people I have spoken to said that I started the issue with my comments on Saturday night and that I could have potentially changed how things went down. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701393013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/187yvt6/aita_for_straightening_my_hair/", "score": 29, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She is entitled to teach her daughter as she wishes. She is NOT entitled to control what other people do with their own hair. She is not entitled to force her opinions on other people. You straighten your hair because you like it that way, just like she prefers natural. \n\nShe overstepped by not only interfering with your rights, bodily autonomy, and personal preferences but also by throwing away your personal belongings. Hair tools are expensive. Her rights stop where yours begin. She owes you and needs to reimburse you. She's a terrible role model for her daughter if this is what she teaches.", "NTA. I am an older white woman therefore unqualified to comment on Black hair culture, but it's *your* hair. It's your body, you get to do what you want with it. \n\nGood on you for respecting the house rules when the little girl asked.  SIL overstepped.", "NTA. At the end of the day, your SIL stole your property and disposed of it. Have you asked her to pay for the cost of a new straightener??", "NTA. SIL needs to stay in her lane. She can parent her daughter how she\u2019s wants but she can\u2019t steal your things and dispose of them. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong, based on what you have described", "NTA. You are free to do what you like with your hair. She is free to do what she likes with her hair. Pressuring or shaming someone for what they want to do with their hair is never ok.", "NTA \n\nyou have it sussed as a biracial woman, that you have two beautiful halves that make a whole, you answered your five years olds niece, questions carefully and respectfully, and in response your hair products were thrown away by your SIL, who thinks because she works within a certain community, she has the right to dictate everyone else's actions, in fact it feel like she's projecting insecurities onto you.  \n\ni get there is a lot of pressure to conform to Western standards of beauty, but that doesn't mean you get to dictate anyone else autonomy, and the fact that your inlaws spoke up for you, instead of her says a lot", "Obvious NTA. She had no right to throw away *your* products that you use on your hair. You also perfectly responded to her daughter when she was curious. \n\nYour comments that supposedly \"started all this\" were in response to her blanket statement trying to dictate what every Black person does with their hair which is unequivocally wrong. Equality is not that every person leave their hair natural - equality is that everyone can choose how they want their hair to look and they get no judgement for it. \n\nShe is a big AH and ignorant too.\n\nETA: you should have your partner bill his brother and SIL to replace your tools.", "NTA. SIL needs to cool down and look at the situation with some perspective, then apologize to you and her daughter. She has the right to not use those products on herself and to disallow them for her daughter, but that is where her authority ends. Throwing out your possessions definitely crosses a line, I hope that there is more level-headed action in the near future on her part: it sounds like you would be receptive.", "NTA. You are not obliged to change how you present yourself or see yourself just because other people have their own issues and choices. \n\nYou or the little girl's mom (or someone) might reassure her that she'll have plenty of time to experiment when she's older. It might reduce tensions a bit if everyone could come up with something to unified everyone could say - maybe explain that her mom has her reasons for the position she has taken, and encourage her to trust her mom on this issue.", "NTA - No one has the right to throw your property in the garbage. End of story.  She sounds controlling and overbearing. Best to you!", "Diosa Mio!!!!! I would be writing this from the jail. FML what a pretentious b%x\u00a9h!!!! Is she going to pay for replacement tools? I have cobwebby naturally curly hair and straighten it most of the time and my tools and products are not inexpensive at all. Fuck an apology, you need a large check from her.\nNTA", "NOPE. nta. you choose what to do with your body and your hair, nobody gets to tell you how you are \u201csupposed\u201d to be, and it is in no way your fault your sil is a thief who is trying to teach her daughter to be a thief as well. \n\nand if that woman is telling her clients how \u201cgod intends them to be\u201d i doubt she\u2019ll be employed for long. or at least i hope she won\u2019t be.", "NTA. There was no possible way you could have calmed her down. She has taken what you do to your own hair to a ridiculous extreme. It's entirely reasonable that her child would want to see how she looked with straightened hair and I'm sure she managed to turn that into you were showing her tools of the devil. And what comments are they alleging you made? You didn't say anything at all out of line.

You were honest and straightforward and respected your SIL\u2019s house rules. I\u2019m glad the rest of the family are on your side!", "NTA. \n\nYou own your body. You control what you do with it. You choose to straighten your hair, that\u2019s your choice. Not her\u2019s, not anyone else\u2019s, your choice. If someone thinks they\u2019re doing you a favor by throwing away your property without your knowledge or permission, you should avoid them like the plague. If they\u2019re willing to go through your stuff because of their beliefs and destroy your property, they will f#%^ with you against your will and when caught will fight tooth and nail to spin it as you\u2019re somehow the problem.", "NTA. SIL needs to apologize AND replace all the items she threw away.  \nHer daughter needs to understand that in order to get the look OP wants, that heat tools are indeed needed, and that no one should be telling her how to wear her hair.", "What comments? Her vehemently disagreeing about YOUR hair is on HER not on you. She had no right tell you what to do with your hair and absolutely no right to throw your things away as that is akin to theft and destruction of personal property. I would send her a bill for the products she threw out. She owes you a big apology. NTA", "Jeez, she's a social worker...NTA. you have a wonderful way of looking at your heritage. You do you! Honestly, I think natural is so gorgeous,  but I think that what makes you feel most confident is the best way. I love that the family took your part!", "NTA\nAs I black woman I understand your SIL, but she was dead wrong for imposing her views on you. For her specific little family sure. You, F that.\n\nAlso while my future kids will not be allowed to get relaxers until they are 18, they can dye, cut, maybe curl or heat straighten their hair (depending on the reason). Everyone is entitled to do what's best for their family NOT control what other parts of their family that they are not responsible for do. My future children will also be mixed. Mixed hair is different from black hair and your SIL is lucky that you found your stuff and not sending her a bill to replace them.", "Everything was just dumped in her bathroom trash can so I was able to retrieve it, thankfully.", "Agree, NTA. \"This is all your fault\" - some people always have to be the victim. Sounds like she is incapable of acknowledging and taking responsibility for her own actions. Also -- your other half's family is SOLID - they absolutely had the right response.", "I found all of my stuff in her bathroom trash can and just took it home. No major harm done there", "Yes, she is. Her dad (his brother) is white", "That\u2019s good.", "I love my natural hair. I have no say over anyone else\u2019s hair. Trust you me your niece will also change her stance too by the time she is 9! not ah. Hope SIL replaced your stuff."]}
