And, the elder grand-daughters are usually treated one of two types: \n\n1. They wanted a grandson, and got you instead, and you are witness to how cunning a person that acts very sweet can be, or\n\n2. You are the Mahalakshmi of the house, the first born of the next generation. They love you more than they can love all other grandkids.\n\nI'm of the second variety, and looks like you are too OP. And yes, in my family I have rights to scold my cousin (not yell) when I think it's right.\n\nI'm gonna say ESH for a few reason: Your cousin is 10 years younger than you, and as older sisters it's our responsibility to teach them if they are wrong, but not yell or threaten them or their families. If you want her to respect her elders, you should have the same respect towards her parents and not threaten them. Your cousin shouldn't have been yelling at an old person even if the grandma was wrong (not defending anybody, but yelling in general is wrong). \n\nThis is why it's always good to have clear boundaries between families even if they are brothers. Living in someone's house without paying rent is boud to bite them in the back one day. Your dad might have told them to just live there, but they will have to scramble if something like this happens, cause technically he is not liable to their living situation.", "NTA.
