And, the elder grand-daughters are usually treated one of two types: \n\n1. They wanted a grandson, and got you instead, and you are witness to how cunning a person that acts very sweet can be, or\n\n2. You are the Mahalakshmi of the house, the first born of the next generation. They love you more than they can love all other grandkids.\n\nI'm of the second variety, and looks like you are too OP. And yes, in my family I have rights to scold my cousin (not yell) when I think it's right.\n\nI'm gonna say ESH for a few reason: Your cousin is 10 years younger than you, and as older sisters it's our responsibility to teach them if they are wrong, but not yell or threaten them or their families. If you want her to respect her elders, you should have the same respect towards her parents and not threaten them. Your cousin shouldn't have been yelling at an old person even if the grandma was wrong (not defending anybody, but yelling in general is wrong). \n\nThis is why it's always good to have clear boundaries between families even if they are brothers. Living in someone's house without paying rent is boud to bite them in the back one day. Your dad might have told them to just live there, but they will have to scramble if something like this happens, cause technically he is not liable to their living situation.", "NTA.

Grandma wanted to honor her husband and was going to do all the work for it, but your Aunt was pissy about it and took it out on her daughter instead, and the daughter decided to lash out at Grandma unprovoked.  In America it used to be you don't disrespect your elders but more and more the generations have gone away from that and as much as we preach tolerance for other cultures, we don't often actually walk the walk when it doesn't suit us. A lot of people are not going to be willing to give a judgement until they know the reason why she was yelling and that grandma was innocent.", "At the end of the day, the 17 year old is old enough to know right from wrong. She took a risk in India (where in some cases you go through extreme shame for disrespect) at a family event to yell at grandma who you said can barely speak, and expected nothing to happen is wild. You may not like something, but you should respect it in many different aspects all over the world so I don't know why in a place like India, redditors expect that their differing opinions matter when real life harm can come to this 17 year old for disrespect. Until she is old enough to leave that area, she needs to stay safe and quiet. NTA, and you may actually have saved her from yelling at the wrong person.", "You threatened a minor with homelessness. Threatened an entire family's housing because a minor was arguing with an adult. You don't even know what they were arguing about.

Maybe your cousin is the asshole or maybe grandma is doing weird shit\u2026\n\nInstead, you used your power for evil and threaten to kick her out of her house. Because? In culture you can bully younger people?  And remove your uncle from his home because his daughter made you mad\u2026\n\nYTA.

Btw NTA, you spoke the truth.\n\nTo all the people who are commenting YTA- Clearly you people don\u2019t know how revered grandparents are in certain cultures. My grandmother raised me until I was 3 years old. She also raised my sister until she was 5 years old. My grandma is like my second mother. She has cooked for me, fed me, cleaned me and clothed me as my mother was quite young when she had me. I would kick my cousin out too if she misbehaved with my grandmother (who is almost equal to my mother) in our house.", "You're NTA for yelling or threatening.

But it doesn't make it right. \n\nIt is highly possible your grandma said something to her that truly upset her. She was angry and she is a teenager. She disrespected you as teenagers do. It was not OK for you to yell at her and drag her family. Yes, you do not disrespect elders, but elders should not disrespect younger ones too. Respect works both ways and that is something you are not understanding.  \n\nBringing her family's situation was not OK. I have had a lot of fights with my cousins and been super angry (I am the eldest), but I don't throw it in their faces how my dad practically gave them the life they have or my mom literally sacrificed time with her own kids to help them. Because that is not their fault nor can you hold them responsible for that. It's not a part of this situation and that is not OK for you to bring it up like that.

If anyone kicks someone out it would be the owners of the house, not the entitled child.", "YTA because you keep on threatening to make your family HOMELESS, when you don't even know why she was angry, and it was ONE person yelling at your sainted Nana, not the entire family.

Cousin then attacked Grandma over it even though Grandma did and said nothing to her about it.  Cousin went after the woman less able to defend herself basically because she was mad at her mom (the grandma's daughter).

Grandma wanted to hold a traditional ceremony and Aunt disagreed, so Aunt took out frustrations on teen, and teen instead of yelling at her mom for getting upset with her, teen went and started yelling at Grandma even though Grandma did nothing to teen and wasn't the one who involved her.  Basically teen was upset and decided to bully Grandma because she couldn't yell at her mom.", "He won\u2019t answer because I\u2019m pretty sure he knows grandma said something that would make anyone upset.

Her mom took out her frustration on the kid, and the kid spoke nonsense because of the mom. \n\nYour grandma, however sweet she might be isn't taking no as an answer when she should.
