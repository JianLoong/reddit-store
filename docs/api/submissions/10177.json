You told him multiple times that it hurts your feeling to be called this term, and he chose to blatantly ignore it. Friends should be considerate of each other's feelings. Jake - and sadly the rest of the group - are not.", "So \"bitch\" has become a thing gay guys (particularly those on the more fem side of gay) call eachother, as a synonym for girl, girlfriend, etc. It's almost a badge of honour for some.\n\nThere are however two issues with this.\n1. Like it or not, the word does have more than one meaning pertaining to humans, and the other meaning is far from a badge of honour. Even in general American. Which is an inescapable culture where you guys are. So that makes you completely in the right for not liking the term.\n\n2. His quote of \"don't be such a bitch\" means he's aware of this other meaning, and also uses it. How are you to know what he means in what situation?\n\nOn top of all that, you get to decide what you're comfortable being called. Not he.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA.\n\nHe\u2018s a misogynistic AH and his sexuality is irrelevant to the discussion, and so is his culture.\n\nDon\u2018t spend more time than necessary with any of them, they aren\u2019t worth your effort and company.", "Mmmmm, no, it's not part of anyone's 'culture' to call someone a name they don't want to be called, regardless of how it's intended. NTA, you asked several times and were ignored.", "NTA!  And what is this BS that you \"should be the one adapting to them and not the other way around?\" They don't represent America -- just one teeny tiny corner of it, where the people are clearly RUDE.\n\nI mean, it's fine to use that word -- or any word -- among friends who share their views about it. But as soon as someone says it makes them uncomfortable, then they're the ones who are making a chose to continue using a word they know bothers someone.  This makes them choosing to be RUDE.\n\nI hope you find some nicer people to hang out with.", "Bruh, Jake is an idiot. Gay people are perfectly capable of being grossly misogynistic. In fact, it's not uncommon for some of the more toxic ones to jump in about how repulsive women's bodies are (thankfully have not encountered this irl). Anyway, you're NTA and certainly not a homophobe on the basis of not wanting to be insulted in a \"friendly\" way. I hope these friends of yours are good in some other way bc otherwise I'd dump them.", "NTA. like many are going to say being gay or any other form of minority doesn't give you a pass to be an ahole to others. Also b\\^tch literally is a word for a female dog so he is using a not just derogatory word but also dehumanizing and its why it became an insult for women as a way to dehumanize them as no better then dogs.", "NTA\n\n\nBeing gay is no excuse for that.", "NTA - you've asked him not to call you that. He continues to do so. He's an AH.\n\nThis all sounds supper immature, I hope all involved are fairly young and will grow out of it.\n\n\nAlso- yes gay men absolutely can be misogynistic. Granted he doesn't mean it in a gendered way, but that doesn't change how it's received and he should modify his language", "Nope NTA\n\nGay men are perfectly capable of being grossly misogynistic towards women\n\nYou told him you find it offensive, he should have listened. The fact that he hasn\u2019t makes him the AH", "NTA - it doesn\u2019t matter that he thinks he isn\u2019t using it in a derogatory way. You have expressed that you vehemently dislike it and he is choosing to use the word anyways. Being gay doesn\u2019t give him a pass to use language that you find dehumanizing and offensive. And honestly your friends siding with Jake sounds like AH themselves. It\u2019s not like calling each other bitch is some paragon of the American identity, you don\u2019t have to assimilate to their way of thinking.

You need to find a new group of friends because these people suck.", "NTA,he's being an asshole and being gay is no excuse to call women bitches. I know there are people that think its cool and all but its just trashy and misogynist. The vast majority of wome do not like being called bitches.", "NTA. Anyone, gay/straight/male/female/enbi/whatever is perfectly capable of misogyny, and you can usually spot them when they do  misogynistic things, like calling people b***h without clear permission. He may well not have meant any offense at first, but you told him you were offended and he kept on doing it, so at this point I don't know how he could possibly expect you not to take it personally. He could've been calling you cuddlesnookiebear, never mind something objectively profane, and you'd be rightly offended if he kept it up after you asked him to stop.", "NTA - a derogatory term is a derogatory term.  He is clearly being disrespectful and doubling down on that disrespect.  \n\nIf it's not like that, then he can use your name.  \n\nWorst, if the university has policies that confirm to the same as federal agencies.  He can be made accountable for his words and lack of respect.  \n\nI would find new friends if I was you.", "NTA. As a member of the LGBT community, I despise people who use their sexuality as an excuse to be a prick. His sexuality and culture are irrelevant and you have every right to be upset, OP.

You informing them that you don't like being called a b**** should have been enough for them to stop calling you that.", "NTA.. you said No and everyone should respect it. Also you are they all gaslighting you!", "NTA\n\nThat word is derogatory, regardless of who's using it.  And him being gay has nothing to do with, he's just hiding behind a curtain, giving himself permission.  \n\nIf I were you, I wouldn't interact with him again, don't acknowledge him, don't talk to him and don't respond to him when you calls you that.   \n\nI know I shouldn't be suggesting to change your friend group since you are there for such a short time, but just keep that in mind if you want to branch out to other friends, please do so.", "The word bitch IS derogatory and abusive. Would he be okay if you used the word fag because to you it means cigarette? Of course not. If YOU are offended by it then he should not be using it.

Jake is being a disrespectful little AH. It doesn't matter how they've decided to interpret this word; you've told them repeatedly that you don't like being called it and they are refusing to respect this. You don't have to 'adapt' to this!", "NTA. But if these supposed friends are supporting him, they\u2019re not your real friends then. Real friends don\u2019t do that to other friends.
