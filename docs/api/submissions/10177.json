That's fucking how.", "It\u2019s still misogynistic when used as a slur. \n\nIt\u2019s not \u201clanguage for women\u201d just because it\u2019s misogynistic.", "It's not their word to reclaim though", "You have in fact through your comments today implied that you and men whether trans, straight, or gay ARE more important than women. Have you not noticed literally no one fucking agrees with you? Should have been the first fucking clue", "Oh, so it\u2019s not actually a slur when it\u2019s thrown at a gay man? Or a trans man?\n\nOur masculinity means that we cannot experience oppression or violence?", "So we can\u2019t reclaim slurs used against us, why?", "Idiots on the internet agreeing with me is not a way I assume I am correct. \n\nWomen are oppressed yes. \n\nThe fact that you made a dig at a trans man with a degrading comment about my (non existent) penis shows that you are incredibly transphobic as well as homophobic. \n\nBut sure, you\u2019re right.", "It is also thrown at straight men, but the root of it being a slur is in misogyny. If someone says someone \"bitched them out\" or \"bitched out of\" something, or says \"don't be a little bitch,\" the person recieving the insult can be any gender or sexuality, but the insult itself is rooted in misogyny. It is saying that women are nagging scaredy cats, and womanhood is used as an insult. It is similar to calling someone a pussy.\n\nThe intention behind the slur, is to say that woman are lesser, and that is why it is an insult to call someone that. It does not have as much to do with the reciever of the insult, as it does with the intent that that particular insult is used", "Your \"oppression\" in this instance is tied to misogyny which despite your gaslighting elsewhere is by definition built into a hatred for women", "Are you saying bitch is considered a slur against gay men?", "I love how you assume a random stranger knows if you are trans or not. Again, you're not the main character sweetie."]}
