It's n-word level for me when directed against a woman.", "Hmm, I suggested she call him an AH or pendejo but prick works well too.", "Make new friends, OP.  These are all AHs.", "I use the word bitches all the time. I love its versatility. I don\u2019t consider it a gendered word when I use it. I\u2019m AFAB (but non-binary) and am anti-misogynistic AND if I knew the word made any person uncomfortable for any reason *I would not use it around them*. \n\nIt\u2019s just that simple.", "OP's friends are shitty in a lot of ways, but this isn't gaslighting", "OP, do not do this, you WOULD be TA if you went there. Can't believe so many people are suggesting it, sounds like a lot of people are champing at the bit to call people the worst things they can think of.", "Speaking as a queer woman myself, I don't have a lot of issues with \"bitch\" being used as a term of endearment or affection, particularly by those who are women or queer regardless of their gender, but I have a massive problem with it being used as an insult by anyone or used in reference to people who aren't comfortable with it.\n\nI'm a bit iffy with cis straight men using it but that's purely because they usually use it in an insulting way rather than as a term of endearment.\n\nI frequently use it with my close friends as a term of affection (ie: \"I love you bitch\") but if one of them came to me uncomfortable with the term, I'd stop using it for them. Simple as.", "Wait so they want a baby boy because they\u2019re attracted to men and or penises?

He\u2019s going to have to show his real personality if he gives up being a living stereotype. It\u2019s just cruel of you to force his hand that way. NTA", ">Yeah. That has been my problem with a lot of drag performers as well- they use the platform to openly mock and degrade women. Some performers feel much more like blackface performances than a free expression of creativity.\n\nNowadays it seems like 99% of what's posted online is like that. I grew up in Vegas, and remember when the performances were good natured, now it seems like misogynistic mockery.", "Yup. This is my opinion too. Why on earth is it seen as PoWeRfuL for the gender in charge to dress up like the discriminated one? Gay men are still men, they still are on top\n\nIts mockery. Its done by people who have no idea what we go through-because of THEM no less-acting 'like' us?\n\nIts degrading.", "MM, like... if Jake was using bitch with his friends who share that comfort level, male or female, it would be totally fine. It's not as simple as 'no men know what it's like to be called bitch as an insult', that's categorically untrue! I have cis gay friends who have been called 'bitch'-- I have cis straight friends who've been called 'bitch', for that matter, because any guy who's sensitive or un-sporty or has a gay best friend is going to get hit with homophobic abuse no matter what a ladies' man he is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd PLENTY of women I know use 'bitch' affectionately with each other, too! But it's only fun if everyone's having fun. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nGay trans guy as well, and I've been called a bitch, both derogatory and affectionate, by men and women, by friend and foe, and like... some friends are allowed to call me 'bitch' now! They tend to be the friends who themselves wear the label with pride. BUT, no one gets to start out our friendship addressing me as 'bitch'. There's an intimacy level where it's just not appropriate. But also, if someone told me they just weren't comfortable with it full stop, I can't imagine being such a dick about it as it sounds like Jake is being...", "Boom, thank you. Also, calling stuff out consistently is how you change culture.", ">Because sexual assault is not about attraction, it's about power and control.\n\nThis exactly! This is one of the reasons it's so prevalent in men's prisons and the military, and as a terror tool in warfare.", "I think that's in the context of showing the difference in how he views your mom and the hateful language. People hate what they don't understand a lot of the time, and just knowing that those people are \"regular folks\" like them is a big eye opener.", "I'm not saying it's not misogyny. I'm just saying there are a shitload of men who have been victimized by this language in a way that it seems like you're discounting. \n\n>Gee, wonder what that\u2019s referencing.\n\nI mean, I see what you're saying, but it's disingenuous to not accept that it's *also* an explicit reference to men raping other men. \n\n>It\u2019s primarily an insult to the developmentally delayed, even when slung at people who aren\u2019t.\n\nWith \"bitch\" there are two sets of what the word means. If you were to ask people what it meant when a woman was called a \"bitch\" the answers would be *drastically* different than if you asked them what it means when a man is called a \"bitch.\" A woman who is \"being a bitch\" and a man who is \"being a bitch\" would be acting very differently. Still misogyny, but the connotations of being called a bitch can vary dramatically based on who is being called it. Whereas \"retard\" or \"retarded\" is the same connotation whether it's used against those with developmental delays or not.", "All of this. As a woman myself, and a queer one at that, I have zero issue with queer men using \"bitch\" in a friendly or reclaimatory sense. Same deal with women and nonbinary people. Phrases like \"I love you bitch\" or \"you bitches are so talented\" or whatever, no problem with those.\n\nIt's if anyone begins to use the word in reference to people who do NOT want to be called that or who use it in a misogynistic way against others where I start to have an issue.", "Absolutely-- like, I'd cut a friend out of my life for that in a HEARTBEAT. Right now, OP is NTA in the slightest and the other friends aren't being very empathetic to the fact that OP has a boundary they don't share.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSome friends get to call each other 'bitch' in a casual friendly way... others do not. Just because his intent is not misogynistic doesn't mean the word can't hurt, and when he's told that this upsets one of the people in the group and chooses to ignore OP's feelings, that makes him an AH.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFiring back with 'hey dick'? Fair. And the friends who are being jerks about the issue can maybe take a look at why they're giving one person in the group a pass on hurting another. But 'sissy', let alone that other one? Yeah, regardless of intent, that's a one way ticket to EVERYONE calling OP a raging homophobe and cutting her out, and *they would be right to do it*. Because OP understands that words hurt, and while some people are okay with calling each other bitch in a friendly way and might have trouble understanding why not everyone is cool with it, absolutely NOBODY thinks it's fun and friendly to throw homophobic slurs at someone within the friend group if you're not *both people reclaiming the same slur*.", "McJerkFace is a bit too comical. I suggest something more biting: AH, pendejo, prick"]}
