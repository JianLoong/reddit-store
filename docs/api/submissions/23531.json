So myself (f28) and my husband (m29) went to an event here in my town. I bought this beautiful dress off Amazon for it. I didn\u2019t post it anywhere at all on any of my socials. I did however, send a few pictures of me wearing it in a group chat with some friends. One of those friends  (we will call her Laura) said it was really pretty and asked for the link to where I got it. I gave it to her but was unaware of what she was doing with it as it was not my business to ask. Fast forwards to a few days after the event and I had posted the pictures from it. I was super happy finally being able to share them, ad that night was super special for me. Laura ends up messaging me going off about the pictures I had posted. She apparently was using the dress for her wedding dress and her fianc\u00e9, who I was also friends with, seen it. She tells me I\u2019m the asshole for even wearing the dress after I knew she was interested it and should have just bought another one. She proceeds to dig into me, calling me a wedding wrecker and tells me I ruined her wedding and her relationship. Her fianc\u00e9 argued with her saying I did nothing wrong since I wasn\u2019t aware she was using it as a wedding dress. Laura claims she can not get another dress in time for her wedding in 3 years and she can\u2019t get her money back. She didn\u2019t even know the dress existed until I posted in the group chat asking what to do with my hair. It was already bought before anyone seen it.

For a wedding in three years.\n\nLaura is batshit and I hope that guy isn\u2019t going to marry her when she\u2019s this addicted to drama and self-victimization.", "NTA and wtf is Laura's issue?  Obviously, you bought the thing since you were wearing it in the group chat pictures asking about how to do your hair.  Was she expecting you to not wear it to any events?  I'm sorry, but Laura has another 3 years to figure out her dress issues and to even come at you when you had the dress first, oh no.   Go blast her in the group chat.", "Also per OP's picture, the dress is black and purple; why would anyone think it would be used as a wedding dress?", "PS It's a nice dress.", "I don\u2019t either. If she\u2019s throwing a fit over a nontraditional dress", "Good. Because the next three years are going to be a ride.", "Do you think she even tried Googling?\n\n[purple dress with black lace overlay](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sxsrf=AB5stBhKD1JE7JGyjL9cGMY_QOCK_ASRGg:1690820964845&q=purple+dress+with+black+lace+overlay&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjlyfP3rrmAAxWkl2oFHb60AKUQ0pQJegQICxAB&biw=1366&bih=615&dpr=1)\n\nBecause they aren't rare.", "Nta. She has 3 years to fine another dress. You didn't ruin anything. You bought that dress 1st. You literally wore it in a picture that you sent her. She knew you were planing to wear it sometime soon. \n\nGood for you for not buying into her B.S even if she told you she wanted to wear it as her wedding dress. You did had e ery right to wear that dress and post any pictures online as you saw fit and yes your right she could told you to block her fiance so he wouldn't have seen the dress. \n\nBut at the end of the day she chose to be unhinged and unreasonable. \n\nThat dress is gorgeous by the way. I love the color. It looks great on you.", "How would you know than? Have you asked her? Was it a typical white dress?", "I read that as OP obviously knowing that the friend would be buying it to wear at some point, but not as a wedding dress (and even if she did know that, OP had literally already bought the dress so the friend really has no ground to stand on)", "No idea but the dress popped up immediately when I typed in purple gothic ballroom dress on Amazon", "I misread your comment, she told me after I posted the pictures she was using it as a wedding dress. And not it\u2019s not a typical white dress. It\u2019s a ballroom style black lace with with a deep purple room and fabric. The train on it is a black lace as well. The link is posted in the original post since it was requested people see the dress.", "Is it [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Gothic-Black-Dress-Wedding-Lavender/dp/B076H3T5NC/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=purple%2Bgothic%2Bballroom%2Bdress&qid=1690822782&sr=8-4&th=1)? Then you must have added to the dress as it doesn't have sleeves. Doesn't look as purple either.", "You looked great but might want to censor your faces before Buzzfeed or similar helps this post go viral.\n\n\nNTA by the way.", "I have no idea how to do that as the Facebook post is not mine \ud83d\ude05", "NTA, she will not be getting married in 3 years. Her finance will dump her stupid ass.", "In what conceivable world are you the asshole here? Your friend is being utterly ridiculous. NTA", "Laura is not your friend, and you are NTA.  She got a picture of you wearing a dress, and then claimed that you ruined her wedding by wearing the dress out to an event.  She is delusional and confused, tell her to f\\*\\*k off.", "LOL three years! HAHAHAHAH. if she behaves like this I'm not sure there will be a wedding in three years! LOL \n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nShe can\u2019t find a dress in three years? Nonsense.\n\nShe can\u2019t believe you would wear the dress you bought for yourself after she decided to wear it for her wedding and didn\u2019t tell you? Insane\n\nThree years from no one will remember you wearing a specific dress but everybody will remember Laura\u2019s public freakout.", "NTA. This is so dumb, please don't apologize or back down.", "Oh, dear God!!! She has plenty of time to find another dress and buying one *now* means taking a huge risk that it might not fit in three years.  I wonder if she'll blame you if the dress doesn't fit in three years?!", "You can always take the link down for now and add an Amazon link later.", "I\u2019ll do that. Thank you :)", "Ngl, that's gorgeous and I may also be stealing that idea for a wedding dress, but you are NTA for wearing what is essentially a two-tone ballgown to a fancy event. Your friend is screaming of entitlement. NTA", "She can\u2019t get a wedding dress for her wedding three years from now? That\u2019s the biggest steaming pile of BS I\u2019ve ever heard. NTA", "That dress is stunning and I want it in every single color, I have no where fancy to wear it but I'll wear it to do errands!", "3 YEARS?! HELLO?!\nNTA. laura however? major AH. like maybe i would get it if she didn\u2019t blow up like that or if the wedding was like- in a few days, but YEARS is crazy af \ud83d\ude2d", "NTA. But I agree with Laura, maybe you should work on your mind reading skills.", ">Laura claims she can not get another dress in time for her wedding in 3 years\n\nWhat the actual fuck?!?   She has 3 years to find and get a dress. \n\n>She tells me I\u2019m the asshole for even wearing the dress after I knew she was interested it\n\nEntitled much?!?\n\n>Her fianc\u00e9 argued with her saying I did nothing wrong since I wasn\u2019t aware she was using it as a wedding dress.\n\n  Well he knows NOW... Laura is an idiot\n\n\nNTA", "Go right ahead! Like I said in other comments, I don\u2019t care if people use the dress. I willingly gave the link but if they had told me what it was being used for, it could have been much easier to manage", "Thanks!"]}
