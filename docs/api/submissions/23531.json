So myself (f28) and my husband (m29) went to an event here in my town. I bought this beautiful dress off Amazon for it. I didn\u2019t post it anywhere at all on any of my socials. I did however, send a few pictures of me wearing it in a group chat with some friends. One of those friends  (we will call her Laura) said it was really pretty and asked for the link to where I got it. I gave it to her but was unaware of what she was doing with it as it was not my business to ask. Fast forwards to a few days after the event and I had posted the pictures from it. I was super happy finally being able to share them, ad that night was super special for me. Laura ends up messaging me going off about the pictures I had posted. She apparently was using the dress for her wedding dress and her fianc\u00e9, who I was also friends with, seen it. She tells me I\u2019m the asshole for even wearing the dress after I knew she was interested it and should have just bought another one. She proceeds to dig into me, calling me a wedding wrecker and tells me I ruined her wedding and her relationship. Her fianc\u00e9 argued with her saying I did nothing wrong since I wasn\u2019t aware she was using it as a wedding dress. Laura claims she can not get another dress in time for her wedding in 3 years and she can\u2019t get her money back. She didn\u2019t even know the dress existed until I posted in the group chat asking what to do with my hair. It was already bought before anyone seen it. AITA? \n\n\nEdit: adding a link to the event pictures of me wearing the dress with my husband.
