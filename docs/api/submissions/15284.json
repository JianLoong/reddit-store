Because that WOULD make you a jackass.  Why are you so attached to the word?  Why can't you say \"belief system\" instead?  Is it because \"mythology\" implies a certain \"lack of reality\" and you really really *really* need \"religious\" people to acknowledge their holy texts aren't factual accounts?", "Belief system or ethos and mythology do not mean the same thing. And no, mythology does not reflect lack of reality. I feel like at least some of this is coming from your preconceived notion of the term. Just going through the wiki page on this should clear that up. \n\nThat said, I would not go out of my way to discuss someone\u2019s religion. In most settings it\u2019s considered inappropriate, intrusive and insulting, I agree. *Except* in a classroom discussing history and culture! That\u2019s kind of the point of these subjects? It\u2019s not meant disparagingly. Mythos quite literally translates to narratives on early history; and in academia, it\u2019s fairly common to use the term in religious and cultural contexts. \n\nI feel like I\u2019ve touched a nerve with you though, so I\u2019m just going to apologise for offending you. I was engaging on semantics and I didn\u2019t mean any of this as a personal attack on your beliefs. Let\u2019s just agree to disagree"]}
