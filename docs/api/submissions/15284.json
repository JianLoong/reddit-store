In the church I grew up in, a lot of the Bible was seen as metaphorical, or as something that had to be taken with a grain of salt due to translation errors and/or the cultural context in which it was written.", "There\u2019s kind of two parts to your answer.\n\nFirst, what I primarily mean by saying that these stories are mythological is that \u201cmyth\u201d is simply the correct literary term to describe these texts. We often use the word \u201cmyth\u201d to denote something that\u2019s false, but it\u2019s literary definition basically just means a traditional origin story - often one that involves supernatural events. And this definition doesn\u2019t necessarily rule out the option of claiming that the creation myth in Genesis 1, for example, also happens to be true.\n\nThat being said, I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to believe that the entire Bible is completely factual about everything it claims. This method of reading the Bible literally, called biblicism or biblical literalism, is actually a fairly recent way of approaching the Bible. It wasn\u2019t until the mid 1800\u2019s that Protestant Christians started making the claim that the Bible should be read literally, unless clearly communicated otherwise. Biblical literalism was essentially a response to the scientific method, which largely defined the modern era. Christians were uncomfortable with the idea that \u201cscience\u201d could be a greater source of truth than the church, and so they formulated the idea that you could basically apply the scientific method to the Bible, as a completely factual text without error.\n\nUp until then, Christians were actually quite comfortable reading the Bible as cultural myth. It may be foreign to us to read it as myth, but that\u2019s because we have a modern (and even postmodern) understanding of what \u201chistory\u201d means. For example, the early church fathers, who lived in the 4th and 5th century, held the general consensus that the story of Noah\u2019s flood in Genesis 6 was not a historical event. But that didn\u2019t matter much to them, because the point of the story isn\u2019t that it happened, it\u2019s that God chooses to rescue the good from the bad.\n\nIn my personal opinion, the core requirements of Christianity are the belief in a trinitarian God and an incarnational Christ - and more importantly, a love for this God and for neighbour. I don\u2019t think you need to interpret everything in the Bible literally to fit this description.", "Even the things that contradict each other!", "The only reason I come here is for the  comments. I get high and then laugh my ass off. This one was particularly good.", "That\u2019s an interesting fact I was not aware of.  Thanks for posting.", "WAIT FOR REAL?\n\nDoes that mean Judaism has no concept of Satan/Lucifer/etc. or demons either?", "I strongly considered converting to Judaism before I eventually gave up religion altogether because i liked it so much better.", "But all religions are mythology.", "Then I'm willing to say we're more on the same page than not and I agree it is better to use scripture names for any scriptures than the term mythology. (I'll even concede that mythology might seem less disrespectful to me because at least the response \"No, not the MCU version\" isn't warranted with it.)", "\"no sign of Penny, good, I would give anything not to have her see\"", "Properly read, the Bible is the most potent force for atheism ever conceived.\n\nIssac Asimov", "Same, same, same, my friend. The comment section is the best with a good high.", "Shaitan the adversary shows up in the Tanach (Jewish scriptures - we don't call it the Old Testament) but his role is very different. He's more of a prosecuting attorney figure, in service of God. No fallen  angel business - that's all Christians. \n\nWe have demons and goblins in our folklore, but the concept is very different at its core.\n\nHere: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shedim", "It's nice to be appreciated! Go and be a good person on  your own terms. :)", "People have started worshiping Greek, Norse, and Egyptian gods again. So if it's disrespectful to call Christianity mythology, then it's also disrespectful to refer to those beliefs as mythology as well, since to their followers those religions are just as valid as Christianity.", "Yeah, I think it\u2019d be more fair to say that Christianity, as an evangelical one/three god belief system, has some difficulty not treating all other religions like mythology. There\u2019s a lot more leniency when you allow for the existence of other gods, like Hinduism, consider Jesus a prophet, like Islam, or relegate gods as secondary to the natural order, like Buddhism or Shinto.\n\nGranted there\u2019s still gonna be a Venn diagram of judgmental religious types but the nature of Christianity kind of puts heavy weights on the balance scale.", "And sometimes, there\u2019s a third, even deeper layer, that\u2019s the same as the top surface layer. Like with pie.", "[removed]", "Right on, right on.", "That is *so cool*.", "I\u2019ve heard said that stereotypes are dangerous _because_ of the element of truth, not _despite_ it.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It's not (not even in the bladder).  There's a myth that bulls hate the color red.  Charging red caps has nothing to do with color, and everything to do with the cape moving.  There's a myth that we only use ten percent of our brain.  I think we can all recognize how silly that one is.\n\nSo when you call someone's holy text a \"myth\" - that's the context.  You're calling the foundation of their faith a bunch of debunked old wives' tales that only a foolish person would still believe to be true.\n\nI don't understand why everyone is so opposed to using the more neutral \"belief system\" as opposed to mythology.  I know Reddit is hostile to religion, and maybe that's the explanation.  They can't be respectful, even for a minute, even to teenagers just trying to get through a class without being insulted.", "> By this logic we also shouldn't call it Greek and Roman mythology because some people still worship the gods from them.\n\nReally?  Who?  Who are the people going around worshiping Zeus and Hades?", "Are you familiar with the religion of pagans/Paganism? It's a religion still very much practiced that believe in the Greek/Roman gods.", "I thought they were more Norse-aligned?", "Roman pagans worshipped 12 main deities that they adopted and adapted from Greek paganism. These gods were Jupiter, Juno, Vesta, Ceres, Mercury, Mars, Apollo, Diana, Vulcan, Poseidon, Minerva, and Venus. there's different breaches I guess you could say, nowadays pagans who follow the Roman gods are more often."]}
