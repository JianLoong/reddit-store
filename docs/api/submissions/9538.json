It was a Christmas present and to give context I work an hour away from where I live and I work overnight, so I was staying up a lot and barely getting sleep cause I wanted it to be done and shipped to her on time. I chose the yarn I did because she he has a lot of pain and stuff and I heard that like weighted blankets helped people so I had used that yarn because it was soft and it would be a little heavier but I thought it would help. I even used a color she liked. On Christmas we watched her open it on video chat, no excitement or anything which... Ok fine, fair enough I guess. Apparently it was too heavy for her to sleep under which, again that's fair I suppose but... It kind of hurt when she told my mom that she wanted to donate the blanket. (Sometime else happened on a future Christmas that made her wanting to donate the blanket so much worse) No clue if she did donate the blanket or not, but yea your feelings are valid and definitely you are NTA.", "NTA\n\nIf it did not fit, the correct thing to do was to honestly tell it to you and ask if you could make it the right size, or if she could do it (with your permission).", "NTA.

I'm infuriated for the kid.", "Right. I knitted my father a beanie that he thought was too tight (even though I asked him for measurements), so I made him a loser one and he gave the first to his girlfriend. She was super thankful I had knitter her a beanie lol.\n\nBesides, the love is in the act of knitting, not in the yarn!!! Why would anyone ever redo the work???", "The AH mother sounds like she's ten years old.", "This!", "You can't expect someone to fix problems you didn't tell them about. It'd be one thing if she told her daugher it didn't fit and she was like oh well its yours now that's your problem. \n\nAt the end of the day she just undid someone's hard work with no explanation...that is pretty rude imo. The least she could have done is tell her daughter the problem so that when she unraveled her work she wouldn't take it as a sign that her mom hated it and was ungrateful. \n\nIf I crocheted someone a hat and they frogged it and re did it how they wanted without talking to me I'd take it as a sign that they were just too cheap to buy their own yarn.", "I mean I think communication being key applies to the mom too. I can't imagine unraveling someone's work without discussing it with them first. If this happened to me I would want to fix the hat myself - it's a gift I put love and time into, I wanted to make you something and at the end of the day I really just bought you yarn. \n\nI'm also kinda confused about how much bigger she could have made the hat while working with the finite amount of yarn that the too small hat was made with, but that's more out of crafting curiosity lmaoo", "Handmade gifts are a category all their own, and remaking something given to you is ridiculously rude. I would be mortified if someone cut into something I made and remade it, when the \"making it\" part is really the gift. I wouldn't make a scene but I would definitely never make anything for them again. \n\nIt'd be like if you made a gift box of cookies for someone and they said they don't really like cookies, and crumbled them into fine pieces in front of you to use as ice cream topping. You'd think they were nuts. The socially acceptable thing to do is thank them and move on.\n\nN A H, but the mom went about it wrong and I wouldn't gift anything else in the future either.\n\nEdit: she even changed the style of the hat and probably had extra yarn in the end. She didn't do a simple size alteration,  she took apart the gift and re-purposed the yarn to make her own thing. NTA at all.", "It's not an euphemism\ud83d\ude05", "\u2026", "4", "I agree so much. Finding out she re did it in a completely different pattern and stich made it 30 times worst. \n\nI'm not going to lie to you I've met mothers before that are just wildly controlling and think there kids can't do anything right - I'm having trouble even believing the hat didn't fit and that's why she undid it. I know im jumping to conclusions here because I don't know if this sort of thing is typical with this mom but yeah I wouldn't be shocked at all to learn the hat fit fine and she just thought she could do better.", "It was the other way around, it was too big and she made it smaller", "Ooooh ok well that completely answers my question about how that would work silly me. I was wondering if she had to go buy more yarn and color match it hahaha I'm dumb that was obvious \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\n\nIn a weird way I think that was my fat girl bias coming out. I only ever alter things to make them bigger and just completely forgot it could go the other way too hahahahaha", "I should have added that detail to the original post, sorry about the confusion \ud83d\ude05\n\nShe also changed the style to a simpler one, so she might even have extra yarn at the end \ud83e\udd14", "Yeah if someone did this to me I would straight up be like listen if you couldn't afford the yarn for the project you wanted to do you could have just asked me. She unraveled it and used a completely different pattern???? It's not your gift anymore at all you legit just gifted her some yarn at that point"]}
