Especially if the new pattern was simpler. That\u2019s because more complicated patterns are hard to do without the written pattern in front of you or having done the pattern with enough repeats to have memorized the pattern. \n\nAlso, as a knitter, if it was legitimately too big for her mom that\u2019s kind of on OP. Again, mom was hella rude, but if you\u2019re going to put all the effort into making something like that where it needs to fit the person, unlike a cowl/scarf/blanket, you don\u2019t start without getting measurements. \n\nSome people have a big head and some people have a small head.

OP saw and kindly explained to me that her mom actually made the hat smaller (duh) but in that explanation she also told me that even still her mom ended up using an entirely different pattern with a much simpler stich than she used, and thus probably used less yarn anyways so in that way she may have also been able to size it up if that was what she needed. \n\nIt was a very informative comment thread lol", " \n\nI don't understand how weaving works when it comes to resizing something", "You dont really with weaving, knitting boooy thats a can of worms lol without badically teaching how knitting works.\n\nBasically knitting is pulling a loop through another loop, if you pull a loop through 2 others at once you decrease the width of the fabric, if you pull an extra loop up you gain a stitch and increase size.\n\nIf you reknit in a different stitch pattern (like tshirt fabric is knit in \"stockinette\" uses very little yarn usually, where cable work requires twisting the stitches around each other so you have more yarn in a given spot of fabric thus consuming more yarn per sq inch).\n\n\nGlory i hope that makes sense \ud83e\udd23", "OH MY GOD. \n\nI already replied, but no, you are not the asshole, and you do not deserve this shit.

I crochet and knit and if someone undid my work to do it themselves, then the only gift I\u2019d give in the future is yarn for them to do it themselves. I\u2019d be very upset. However, I\u2019d suggest that if you want to mend this, try to talk to her again. Be straight forward that seeing her \u201cfix\u201d it without talking to you made you feel (I\u2019m guessing here) that your work wasn\u2019t good enough for her. That if there was an error- like it not fitting- it would have been a valuable learning experience and something you could have corrected yourself. That you\u2019d prefer in the future for her to talk to you if there\u2019s an issue with an item instead of changing it herself without a word, and that because of how you feel, it\u2019s going to take some time before you feel comfortable giving her something. \n\nMaybe ask her to consider how she would feel if she saw you undoing her work and doing something else with it without talking to her about it. If you go that route too, try to keep her focused on how it would feel, not how she would react, because I\u2019d bet my balls (of yarn) that if you asked her to see it from your perspective, she\u2019ll initially say that she\u2019d never stop making for you. No, mom. How would that situation feel? \n\nIt all boils down to communication and respect for the time and effort. If she respected your effort, she would have left it alone or talked to you. And I\u2019m sure if she had said \u201chey, this doesn\u2019t fit right, I\u2019d like to adjust it\u201d, you would have been a lot more okay with her changing it or would have offered to fix it yourself. NTA\n\nJust don\u2019t go making broad sweeping choices, like never or always.

Haven't we all received something we end up giving away or exchanging?\n\nBut you are certainly NtA for refusing to make anything else. If it upset you she unraveled it, by all means don't knit for her again. That is absolutely your call! No one is ever owed your time and efforts.\n\nAs for me though, I'd rather someone remake a gift into something they'll use rather than throw it away or regift it.", "Totally NTA. \n\nI once asked my friends chat for advice about a cross-stitch project I was working on for a relative and one person commented that it wouldn\u2019t matter anyway, because it was only going to get stashed in a closet and forgotten about.\n\nShe now wonders why she\u2019s never gotten a project from me when quite a few of our friend group has. \n\nIf it didn\u2019t fit, she could have asked if you could fix it.", "NTA and with her not talking to you, you get a big win.", "She needed to tell you that it didn't fit and then either ask if you could fix it or if you minded that she do it on her own. Instead she decided to undo and redo your hard work and then insult it in the process.   \n\n\nNTA.", "NTA at all\n\nthe [sweater curse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweater_curse) is SO real and goes for pretty much any handmade item and any relationship, it's weird to me that she's also a knitter and--knowing the time effort and money (even if it was just one skein) you put into the beanie--still completly undid it\n\nlike maybe you were harsh but i would be too. i feel like part of the charm of handmade gifts is that someone made something thinking of *you*, like the item itself kind of comes after the intent behind it, you know? my niece made me a bracelet that practically cuts off my circulation whenever i wear it but fuck it, she spent time on it and was so excited to give it to me, i'd feel like an ass undoing it", "Knot the asshole (NTA). Sounds like she was spinning you a yarn, but at least now you're off the hook and don't need to waste your talents on her ungrateful self.", "NTA seriously you made that, I promised myself never to make my mum something again I made a clay animal at school and she just threw it in the trash. It hurts when they treat stuff you made like trash or 'fix it' to make it better", "NTA She is not yarn worthy. Full stop. Don't spend another second feeling guilty. I say this as a knitter and crocheter.", "Feelings are hurt on both sides work it out", "My mother was just like this too and it hurts your confidence so much. I finally just stopped telling her when I made things cause she was never as critical of things I \"bought\". Sometimes I even got compliments on my \"purchases\" lol\n\nIf you aren't already I really recommend joining some craft communities, either online or irl. Their love and support cheered me on when my mom made me doubt myself \ud83e\udd17", "What a rotten mother. I bet those dresses and those hems were bloody fantastic. Your kids will remember them all their lives. My mum once made us three nighties out of a material that was terrible and ripped all the time, we still wore them regardless and loved them. And I'm going to message my mum to ask her if she remembers them and tell her i love her.", "Yes! Complete passive aggressive BS.", "Oh, and if the beanie didn\u2019t fit, she could have told you, and she could have kept the \u201cmasterpiece\u201d comment to herself", "In a comment, the OP mentioned that the Mom made it smaller in a different knit pattern.", "She made it smaller in a different pattern and hat shape.", "Where did you see she made it a different style? I missed that.", "So for Christmas last year me and my mom bought my dad I think it was a 65 inch TV, we did it on black Friday because there was a super great deal. My grandmother found out and my mom told her that I had bought it for him. No joke my grandmother apparently messaged my mom back and got butt hurt because I got him the TV and that basically my mom knew that she wanted a big TV. Unfortunately my mom gave in and got her the TV, I told my mom she really shouldn't have. The reason I think it makes it worse is because she was getting upset about the TV and yet something I made for her is basically just, what, trash? She told my mom later that she had been joking and stuff. Spoiler: she definitely wasn't. That's just the biggest thing though. She's the type that you do something nice and get her stuff and she'll complain about it and lord knows she doesn't seem to appreciate anything so I really really should have known better tbh. I guess I just thought it would be different since it had been hand made \ud83d\ude05", "Oh no, the mom is the asshole then. I can understand making it smaller but not changing the pattern and shape.", "[removed]", "In one of the ops comments", "Yeah, people like that don\u2019t appreciate or deserve handmade anything.", "Me too! That's a large part of why I think that despite very little evidence....that line alone insinuates she's got a flair for the dramatic. That and there would be so many easier and quicker ways of making the hat smaller it all really makes the size thing feel like a cheap excuse. And then on top of that she takes her daughters complaint and throws it back on her like it's her fault and she was being so silly jumping to conclusions? Seems a little manipulative and gas lighty....cause correct me if I'm wrong but the most obvious conclusion to jump to when someone destroys your handmade item is that they didn't like it, not that they needed it a little smaller SO THEY COMPLETLEY RECREATED IT DIFFERENT FROM THE ORIGINAL.", "Oh you\u2019re not wrong on the gauge thing \ud83d\ude02 I\u2019m like 50% done with a really complicated cardigan (Deep Winter Coat by Wool and Pine for anyone interested) and I am KICKING myself for not swatching. I never have, but damn it. \ud83d\ude02 I figure I\u2019ll make the button band a little wider and pray that blocking will fix it because it\u2019s 100% merino. \n\nAnd as for your second point about the mom, yeah now that you point it out I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong. Seriously, how could one knitter do that to another knitter? Like this feels over dramatic, but considering how much time, thought, and effort goes into a project from selecting the pattern and the yarn and then the time it takes\u2026\n\nBasically what OP\u2019s mom has shown, and OP told her, is that she\u2019s not knitworthy. And for a knitter to be told that it\u2019s definitely an insult, that you don\u2019t understand or value the effort that goes into making something, but a deserved one in this case.", "Or wash the damn thing in hot water.  This was an easy fix.", "Her reaction of not speaking to you is extreme.", "Oh shit... It IS my cake day. What... what do I do?\n\nAt the very least, ASK. I have asked fiber friends if I can redo something. I have had cotton sweaters start sagging after years of wear and love and ASK if they want to help me come up with a project to reuse the yarn AND they get to choose. A lot of love and care goes into knitting/crocheting and that needs to be addressed.", "NTA. I made my great niece a blanket by crocheting it. My niece put it on the floor of her car and never used it for her daughter. I was pissed. She didn\u2019t even try to hide it. But my own aunt asked me to crochet something I made for myself after I posted it on my FB page. She lives in 2000 miles away so I have no idea if she actually uses it. How people treat things we make makes a great impact on us. I believe you\u2019re right to be hurt and rightfully don\u2019t want to make her anything else.", "YTA. It didn\u2019t fit and she was making it fit so she could wear it. Convenient that it was 2 paragraphs of woe is you and then one sentence explaining why she did it.", "NTA. As a knitter, unravelling something I made? Massively insulting. Not worthy of future knitted gifts. And Mum should know that, if she's a knitter herself.", "Your mom don\u2019t fuk around", "NTA! One of my friends decided to start knitting, she then spent nearly a year, while I was in hospital (was there a long time, serious car accident), knitting me a poncho. No it wasn't perfect, yes it was massively too big. Do you think that made a difference? Absolutely not. She gave me it 6 years ago and I still use it at when I'm at home. The amount of effort that goes into these things is crazy, and somebody has taken that time to make you something. To not appreciate that is mad in my mind.", "NTA,\n\nYou have my complete empathy here. My mother actually did something similar when I first learned to knit. I suppose she even took it a step further. She took one of my first projects away from me while I was knitting it, then  took both my project and my needles home with her in order to \"help finish it properly.\" Back then I kind of watched in shock, not quite believing she actually did it. \n\nNow, well, her tune has changed. She complains, often, that I knit for others, but not her. Insult to injury, my unintended revenge is I continued knitting. Not only that I got quite good at it. The more elaborate the piece, the better I knit. And because I am hot natured, I don't knit for myself, I knit for others which everyone knows. Aunt's, cousins, friends, I happily knit for most. My mother, however, gets only photos of my projects or sees the results from others. \n\nSo, my advice? Continue knitting if you enjoy it. Stick to your guns about not knitting for her again - she won't appreciate it anyway. But if you continue doing it, there will come a day she may well regret her actions without you ever having to say more about it.", "NTA. That is so unbelievably rude. The first scarf I made my mom is unbelievably ugly and she never wears it (I don't blame her) but at least she never frogged it and completely remade it.", "Lack of communication doesn\u2019t make y the AH. You should have just talked to her.", "NTA\n\nHAH, oh moms. This reminds of the trend \"would you like to address your trauma or double it and pass it on\"?  Your mom chose to \"double it\"! Humans are mean to each other when they themselves are hurting. If you're up for the challenge, try radical acceptance and compassion towards your mom, otherwise, just let it go and know that we here on Reddit have your back :)", "I read the title and already decided NTA because you are always allowed to decide this. And as a knitter/crafter I have very personal feelings about when I give people my handmade items.\n\nShe just as easily could have come back to you and said it didn't fit, but no, she undid it. Nope. You will never be the AH for deciding someone doesn't deserve the devotion of time and labor and money involved in a handmade gift.", "NTA. my mother is way better at sizing than i am but she's always accepted my projects with grace. i'm horrified that your mother took your gift apart, of course you're not doing any more for her. i wouldn't. i don't think most craftspeople would", "NTA, but if your ma is such a hotsy totsy knitter, let her knit her own stuff. Learn from someone else.", "nta. She is un craft worthy.  I crochet and let I would never make her anything again, either.  It's odd that that would be her response.  my first instinct would be to tell you it does not fit, I;d figure you could maybe add a couple of rows or something.", "As many crafters on here have said, the idea that she undid it because it was too big sounds like BS. Literally just saying, \"I really appreciate the work you did but unfortunately I can't wear it,\" would have been faster, easier, and much more respectful of the gift and gifter.", "Thank you.", "Big hugs. I know. It is so hard.", "I knit and unraveling to add or remove stitches/ribbing would absolutely be a valid way to resize and i would not be offended if someone did so. it\u2019s not changing the work, just making it wearable.", "My mother wanted a little bag for her meds and wallet and a few things she took whenever she left the house for appointments and shopping etc. she showed me the size. About the size of a hardcover fiction book in an even square. I can\u2019t remember who picked out the color but she used it until the day she went to the hospital to die. Now my older sister uses it. Even after finding out I made it. It\u2019s one of the things that made me decide to give her a chance at a relationship again. I was definitely the black sheep out of my sister and I. But my mom used it like it was the most expensive bag she ever had. That really makes a difference in how we feel that\u2019s for sure.", "You are correct so that's why I would not make her anything ever again lol. I actually think that was one of the last things I crocheted. I do tend to go from different craft projects but I'm pretty sure that's one of the things that caused me to have less motivation to crochet \ud83d\ude05. Maybe I'll pick it up again eventually tho, who knows", "Ehh \u201cWow you just love to undo anything I do I guess. Never knitting for you again!\u201d is pretty childish.\n\nWhen OP saw the mom undoing it, she could\u2019ve been like \u201chey, what happened?\u201d Instead of bottling it up and then making a passive aggressive remark. Mom doesn\u2019t need to give the silent treatment bc it\u2019s completely unproductive.\n\nETAH or at least immature.", "Wow, that pattern is an absolute work of art! I don't think I could even cast on without swatching lol I would be so worried to spend an eternity making something that wouldn't fit", "Tell them you love it and make sure you take a picture in it.  Ask if they'd consider making you another one in XYZ color and you'll gladly pay for the yarn...then also pay them a bit extra for their time.", "NTA.\n\nI crochet (as well as doing other crafts - stained glass, woodworking, etc.) and after finding something that I specifically made for a relative in their garage sale FOR A QUARTER, I resolved not to make anything for them again.  Other equivalent relatives (think aunts / uncles / etc.) may get handmade gifts, but this person either gets nothing or some store-bought thing.  They haven't ever asked about it, though, so it must not be important to them (so why should I put the time and expense into making something not appreciated.\n\nSimilarly, made another relative's children each individualized blankets, tied to their particular interest.  Went to their house once and saw 2 of the 3 blankets in the yard, 1 being used as a dog bed and the other in a mud puddle.  Nothing else for them, either.\n\nThis is not to say that a gift has to be kept forever.  I've had people ask if I cared if they (a) passed a gift on to someone else who needed / would appreciate it or (b) asked if they could return a gift that I'd made and for which they have no further use (like when they were downsizing a household).  No issues there whatsoever, as the reasons for the change were made known and discussed.\n\nHandmade gifts represent much more than an obligation fulfilled.  They are an expression of love and affection; if they aren't realized and appreciated that way, why go to the effort?", "No one in an asshole you are just way too sensitive", "NTA. You can be upset at this. if someone knit me a hat that didn\u2019t fit, reknitting it would be the last thing I\u2019d consider.", "NTA. And don't fall for your mother's passive aggressive behavior. Give the silent treatment nonsense to your own daughter? Who does that? \nYou are right to never knit for her again. She seems to enjoy hurting your feelings.", "Oh wow hell no. My mum and I both knit, and I would be so hurt if she did that. If there was a problem with fit a gift you gave her, the appropriate thing for her to do would be to tell you, and solve it together. NTA", "NTA. Throw her away and get a new mother. This is a joke btw.\n\nShow her this thread and try and have a conversation about this with her.", "Also, if my child made me something that didn't quite work or fit guess what? I would still treasure it because my child made it for me.", "Try knitting! It makes a much different fabric and you\u2019ve probably already got a yarn stash waiting to be used.", "Even if frogging was the only option to fix it, she should have let OP remake it! Or AT LEAST tell them first!"]}
