My Mom was 45. I was in my senior year in high school and was super excited about the opportunities senior year would bring as I was in theater. Unfortunately around the 2nd term (October) I started to feel really ill, I messaged my mom nearly everyday for the next month. We went to a destination location for my aunt's wedding at the end of the month. For the whole trip I would go on excursions then lay in bed for the rest of the day cause I felt so sick and standing made me nauseous. \n\nIn November I basically stopped eating, I wasn't going to school at all, and was sleeping all day. I was working at the time and was miserable. My mom gave me some medication that helped a little but they didn't do much. I was failing school hard because I was too tired to do it. I also started to get sharp pains in my lower abdomen. I had also started puking at this time which I hadn't done in the month before.\nIn the middle-ish of January my Mom took me to the first doctor who was extremely unhelpful and the things he told me to do made it worse. Then at the end of the month my mom took me to a specialist. They said we could try a few tests to see what it was. We did all the tests and nothing showed up. Finally at the end of March the doctor told me they could try to take out my Gallbladder and see if that helped. We did the surgery and it fixed the problem.\n\nSo overall the whole process took about 6 months (about 4 till my mom took me to the hospital). I was extremely depressed because I wasn't seeing any of my friends and was missing out on so many things that came with senior year. It was also my last year that I would be able to play soccer and I was barely able to play in the games. \n\nThe other day I made a statement that was supposed to be a joke, my cousin was saying how he think he had broken his toe, I said something along the lines of \"maybe your mom will take you to the hospital in a timely manner\" my whole family uses sarcasm all the time and I thought I made it obvious it was a joke. I will admit that it may have been a little mean but I truly didn't mean it to hurt her. She got super offended and flipped out and started saying that I was making her look like a terrible mother. I had talked to my mother after when I was kinda angry she didn't take me sooner and asked why, she told me it was cause she thought I was faking, my whole family did. That really hurt cause I was genuinely suffering for 4 months and passed off as a liar. To be fair I was the kind of kid that hated school for a long time and often faked being sick for a day or two. But I found a way to get through school at the end of the last year with the help of an amazing teacher and I had even gotten on the honor roll for the first term. I may be the asshole because she tried to help me eventually and I made her look bad.

Great self-centered perception of things. Your family Is a big AH for assuming you made it up.\nDon\u2019t feel bad for a joke you didn\u2019t think through. It was probably not the best situation with your family hearing it, but mistakes happen and your family did something way worse in my opinion", "OP\u2019s mom: so yeah my child stopped sleeping and eating for 4 months and also kept throwing up and laying in bed crying from it all but hahahaha what a liar amirite?\n\nYour mom is fucking ridiculous OP. NTA all the way. If she doesn\u2019t want to be called a bad parent, then she shouldn\u2019t *be* a bad parent.", "NTA it sounds like she's lashing out because she feels bad over it", "NTA. You don't make people look bad, they do that for themselves.", "NTA if she didn\u2019t want to look like a terrible parent then she shouldn\u2019t have behaved like one.", "Um NTA even if I think my kid is faking it, I\u2019m taking them to the doctor. A day or two is one thing. Four months is insane!", "NTA. Sucks to suck. The thing is - if you don't want to look bad, the easiest solution is to *not be bad.*\n\nI went through that song and dance several times my entire childhood. I couldn't see properly for *literal years* before my mother took me to the optometrist, and that was just to get me to shut up.\n\nGlad you got better though! That's awesome.", "NTA with a caveat:\n\nYou\u2019re young, that\u2019s a really scary experience, you needed the security of knowing someone was taking care of you, and you didn\u2019t get that. Then you were dismissed and insulted. Awful.\n\nSo now you\u2019re understandably mad about what you went through, what you lost out on, and how you were failed. And you\u2019re expressing those feelings the way you\u2019ve learned to express difficult feelings - indirectly.\n\nYour mom, on the other hand, is an adult, but one who also did what it sounds like she has also learned (from the same people) to do with difficult feelings.\n\nInstead of confronting the fear that her child might actually be very sick, she went into denial that was made easy by your history of (and here\u2019s a pattern for you to be aware of) claiming to be ill instead of trying to directly work through what you were experiencing.\n\nAnd now she is living with the guilt and fear that when her child was, in fact, very sick, she might have failed as a parent. So when you indirectly called her out, what she probably heard was the accusation she was already actually afraid is true\u2026 and that was sufficiently scary to send her back into defensiveness, denial, and blame.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA because you\u2019re not the adult, so it wasn\u2019t your responsibility. You\u2019re also NTA because I doubt in that context you had any real opportunity to learn better skills for addressing hard feelings.\n\nBut you\u2019re going to be the adult soon, and if you want healthier relationships than the ones you\u2019re witnessing, you\u2019re going to have some catching up to do. So here\u2019s the lesson:\n\nYour family isn\u2019t using sarcasm to make jokes, they are using jokes to avoid direct communication. Your joke hurt your mom\u2019s feelings because it wasn\u2019t a joke\u2026 but she couldn\u2019t metabolize or address it like real communication because it was presented as a joke. I know you tried once, and that was excellent. Then it sounds like you got hurt again and backed away.\n\nStick with it. Work on that - not for your mom or family, but for yourself. Keep chipping away at staying in those conversations, learning how to express yourself, and finding people with whom you feel heard. When you find yourself compelled to make jokes like that, try to recognize what it is you really want the other person to understand and think about how you could address it more directly.\n\nNTA at all\u2026 but everyone in this dynamic will be at some point because it\u2019s no way to engage in healthy relationships or work through hard times.", "NTA for her not taking you seriously. \n\nBut\u2026..even if she had taken you earlier, it may or may not have actually sped up the time until diagnosis. Doctors often take a long time to diagnose issues that aren\u2019t clear cut. It sounds like the doctor wasn\u2019t sure it was your gallbladder bc the tests didn\u2019t show anything specific but since you had sustain pain for a long time, they thought to give it a try. It worked which is great, but they may not have operated any sooner without the history of it lasting so many monthsz", "Esh.  So yeah I am a parent and I had a kid that was sent home from school \u201csick\u201d every day for weeks.  As I picked him up from school he became joyful and would talk about the plans of what he would do at home.  I believe he was faking it and yeah he was (later admitted).  You also admit to a history of faking illness but are hurt that mom didn\u2019t realize that this time it was true.  Even specialists were at a loss for finding anything wrong!   The other people in your family also thought you were faking it because you did it before and because two doctors - one a specialist - could not find anything wrong with you.   So maybe if you had not cried wolf in the past they would have been more believing of you and maybe too if she has taken you to the doctor on day one, nothing would have been found for months anyway.   So your mom was somewhat wrong but I get it, but you are also wrong for expecting to be believed when you faked sickness in the past.", "Sorry but YTA. You set your self up by faking sick numerous times to get out of going to school. So of course when you actually needed a doctor they didn't believe you. Ever hear of the story \"the boy who cried wolf\"? That story is a moral life lesson for a reason. You made your mom look like an AH because she doubted you. Can you really blame her?

Joke away!", "NTA - \"I thought you were faking\" could be a passable excuse for medical neglect if it lasted one week, two weeks tops. No one fakes being sick for 4 months and if your mom had taken you seriously from day one, gallbladder removal may not have necessary. \n\nI went through a similar experience (mystery illness with pain/nausea/vomiting for 6+ months) and my family responded accordingly. My older sibling took me to the ER when the pain was too much, my mother drove me for doctor's appointments and CT scans, my stepdad picked up my meds from the pharmacy. That's how a family is meant to function. Your joke might have hurt your mom's feelings, but I imagine having your needs ignored for 1/3 of a year hurt more than just your feelings. Instead of trying to justify her behavior, this should be a wakeup call to your mother to pay attention to her children's medical needs, even when inconvenient. As the saying goes, if they wanted you to speak warmly about them, they should have behaved better.", "NTA.  Your mom was pretty crappy for waiting so long to take you to the doctor.  Honestly, that's really neglectful and she should feel guilty, not angry at you.  4 months?  She should be lucky the authorities weren't called by the school!  Suppose it would have been your appendix?  Would she have let you die because she said you were faking?  Faking for 4 months?", "You made her look like a terrible mother because she is a terrible mother. She's embarrassed that people are aware of her bad parenting. 1 or 2 days in one thing but 4 months? She should be ashamed and I hope people are shaming her. NTA. No one should have to wait that long for medical attention, especially a child. Let her feel the shame.", "/r/miserable_elk_0017 I want to point something out for you. She isn't upset they didn't help you sooner. She's blaming you for their lack of concern for your wellbeing. \n\nHave they dismissed your valid concerns over other things before? Do they often ignore or put off your medical needs?\n\nYou don't have to respond to me. Four months of ignoring your care just feels a lot like medical neglect to me. And them blaming you instead of feeling guilty for something they explicitly did isn't uncommon in those situations either.\n\nThis was awful of them. And they should feel bad about it. And getting mad at you for pointing that out is shitty.", "You unfortunately encounter this a lot with any chronic or longer illness.", "I don't think OP is an AH, but thinking a kid is faking an illness when that kid admits to hating school and occasionally faking illness is **not** the definition of being a bad parent. If you immediately take your kid to the doctor for every complaint, you could just as easily be a bad parent in my book -- I've seen way more hovering-hypochondriac parents than dismissive-tough-it-out parents.
