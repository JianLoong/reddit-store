When my daughter turned 5 I started pushing my husband to work, I myself got a job. He didn\u2019t want to. Things escalated and ended up in us getting divorced.\n\nHe got full custody while I got visitations every other Saturday (his dad hired a good lawyer, I couldn\u2019t do that), I also had to pay child support. I used to work a full time and 2 part time jobs to afford my 1 bedroom apartment as well as the child support payments. A year after our divorce, my ex married a new woman.\n\nThere was a lot of child alienation from them, and sadly I couldn\u2019t afford to take them to court again. By the time my daughter turned 14, she was calling me by name and calling her step mom \u201cmom\u201d. I tried my best to hold on to my kid, I went to all the event I could go to, I planned fun days with the limited funds I had, even when I couldn\u2019t afford to turn on the heat, I still made sure to get her a Christmas gift.\n\nSadly by the time she turned 16, she no longer wanted to have anything to do with me. I took them to court, but they did nothing. And the last time I saw her, she said some very awful things to me. I was defeated, but I decided that I no longer had a daughter, since that is literally what she wanted.\n\nI moved away, met a good man, married him and had 2 wonderful kids. Last year my daughter reached out. She was sorry, she said that she wanted to reconnect. I was hesitant and resentful, but I still talk with her once a week.\n\nSuddenly she asked if she could spend Christmas with us, she wanted to get to know her brothers. I told her that we were not in a stage where I could allow that. It got heated, but I told her that I could not trust her with my kids, and that I was still not 100% sure that I wanted our relationship to become more.\n\nShe says that I am an AH, that I am punishing her for things she had no control over, that I know what she told me and how she reacted to me was a direct result of her father\u2019s manipulation. AITA?\n\nEdit: since a nice redditor brought it to my attention, my kids are adopted, she is my only biological child. I am just used to saying that I had kids. They are technically my late SIL\u2019s children, but I raised them these last 7 years.", "created_utc": 1671746592, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsy75i/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_to_spend/", "score": 12132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like every one of them, even the ones with amazing parents who love them and have a healthy strong relationships. It\u2019s a part of growing up and being rebellious. But you moved away and replaced her with a whole other family. And when she grew up alittle and realized how important her mom is to her and tried to reach out you. You don\u2019t trust her around your kids? She is your kid too. What is going to happen when you two \u201cgood\u201d kids get mad and say they wish you weren\u2019t their mom? You going to abandon them and move away again? Y are definitely TA in this. You are a 46 year old woman with a loving and stable household, she is a 24 year old girl who grew up with her parents clearly resenting each other.

Only now her brain is developed and she's allowed to make her own decisions. And your first response to her trying to reach out to you again was to .. . hold a grudge? Against a child? Wow. Neat choice, there.\n\nYou **are** punishing her for things she had no control over. I loved my dad when I was young. As an adult, I realize he was an insanely abusive loser and love my mom more than ever. We grow up and change our minds. Your child had nothing to do with her father, the divorce, the new marriage. None of that.\n\nThe \"I can't trust you\" line is just straight up mean of you. She's a totally different person now from who she was when she was little and your comment borders on cruelty. \"Sorry maybe next year\" or \"How about we start slow\" or even \"Give me a little time to think on it\" would have been far more kind, but instead you took the opportunity to do further damage. Spitefully.\n\nForgive your child. **Your child.** For things that were not in their control and not their fault.\n\nYou're NTA for deciding you'd rather not do Christmas, but YTA for your reasonings and how you did it.", "NTA you can establish a relationship with your daughter. No need to involve the children unless /until it's good between you both. Not fair to the kids I'd she ups and disappears again because she wasn't actually ready or wanted the relationship to begin with", "YTA. A child does not have to love their parent unconditionally, but a parent does have to love their child unconditionally. You're not 100% sure that you want to have a relationship with your daughter because she hurt your feelings when she was 16 and experiencing trauma? Seriously?? Good for your daughter for trying to repair the relationship, but my heart hurts for her that this is how you're handling it. She deserves better. And your other kids deserve better too... I hope they aren't living in fear that if they hurt your feelings, you'll leave them and resent them forever too.", "Info\n\nWhat happened to make her reach out to you? What opened her eyes to her fathers actions?", "Honestly, I'm not sure if you're the asshole or not. I do think you're missing out an opportunity that you might not get again. I don't know when or how she figured out that they'd manipulated her. I think you're angry that she believed any of it and that she said what she said, and while it's legitimate to be angry, if you want a shot at a relationship, you had better step up and welcome her to Christmas. Just be candid, forgiving, and open. Tell her: I was so hurt for so many years--and I recognize that you are not entirely at fault for that--that I'm having difficulty risking having that kind of pain again. The truth is I want a healthy relationship with you and I'm willing to try and I would like you to come.\" I would probably also tell her that if she has questions, you will tell her the truth and you won't sugarcoat anything. Just try to be tactful. NAH", "Op you tried your absolute hardest with her growing up, you even respected her wishes when she cut contact with you. \n\nNow that she's an adult it's good she's trying to get back into contact with you, but she doesn't get to just expect such a leap forward in your relationship. I imagine you're still very hurt and feel tossed aside after trying so hard. Honestly if it was just a regular day I'd be against you, but staying over for Christmas after only a few conversations is awkward. \n\nNTA, you are 100% deserving of being a little weary. You don't owe her anything after doing so much with 0 reciprocation for years.", "Soft YTA. She's made an effort. She apologized for being brainwashed and she wants to get to know her siblings. And you're just saying nope not interested. It wasn't her fault.", "yta.\n\nif what you say is true, she was manipulated into behaving negatively toward you when SHE WAS A CHILD. now she realizes she was wrong and you're trying to punish her.\n\nstop.", "ESH. I believe that you\u2019re being really harsh and kind of rude to your daughter for things she said almost a decade ago as a teenager. BUT, it\u2019s quite obvious that you have some trauma and hurt in this situation. You shouldn\u2019t feel forced to have her for Christmas if you\u2019re not ready, instead you should offer to meet her in person on neutral territory to lay the ground rules of rekindling your relationship. \n\nI feel like the 1 thing that everyone is missing here is that you have been so LC for almost a decade, do you even know your daughter? I wouldn\u2019t trust her with my family either. However, you will be the unequivocal AH if you shut her out without trying which honestly is what you are doing, she is your child just as much as your adopted sons, you need to try to work through these things (and communicate your hurt) in a manner that matches your comfort, but you need to at least communicate that to the daughter. \n\nWe teach kids there are consequences for their actions, but family should be there. As a parent you aren\u2019t communicating the consequences of her actions that hurt you and that you need to find a way to talk to her because of the hurt she caused. And you never know, indirectly she may have the same hurt and resentment that needs to be let out.", "Soft YTA. I imagine it\u2019s hard to trust and forgive, but that\u2019s what you need to do. If you can set aside you\u2019re anger and work toward forgiveness, you may be able to find peace and have a relationship with your daughter. I wish you the best.", "YTA. You\u2019re actively punishing your adult daughter for something that she did as a child. I hope your new family doesn\u2019t end up also being teenagers, or Christ knows you\u2019ll have three children to let down.", "Yep. YTA. Holding what a teenager said in the past against their adult self makes YTA. Especially if her father was influencing her to say those things. No parent on earth would have a relationship with their children if they remained offended for life by things their teens said.\n\nAs the parent you should be making the overture to your adult daughter, but she is more mature than you and is making the effort instead. Saying that you can't trust her with your other kids is an AH thing to say. What evidence do you have that she is a serial killer or anything like that?\n\nAnd BTW, she is a part of your family.", "NTA", "How the hell did he get custody without a job? Good lawyer or not- you had to do some shit not get 50-50", "Will not say you\u2019re the AH or not, but what I will say is kids say things they don\u2019t mean at 16 and quite frankly, well into their twenties. If my mother judged me based on how I was when I was 16, I\u2019d still be the devil; however, I\u2019m completely different now. Forgive your daughter, she was young and really stupid, probably being manipulated by her lazy, controlling father.", "She\u2019s still your freaking daughter no matter how much you want to deny it. All those years, she was probably torn between you and her dad, and now you\u2019re being the asshole to punish her for it.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to reconnect with you for all the years she lost due to a broken bond with you, and now you\u2019re making her feel like she\u2019s not even your daughter anymore. *How dare you* alienate yourself from your own child. *How dare you* reject her.\n\nYou are a shitty mother to do this to your daughter, and congratulations. Here is an Asshole of the Year Award. \ud83e\udd49\n\n**YTA.**\n\nPS. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s child\u2019s fault she was being alienated from her mother by her dad. Parental alienation *is* a form of emotional abuse, and it is never the victim\u2019s fault.", "YTA - this is an opportunity to make the relationship into what you want and you are doing everything you can to make sure it never happens.  Be a mother and make sure she knows she can come to you and talk about the hard stuff from y\u2019all past.  Be a good person.", "I don\u2019t believe and parental alienation. If you are present in your children\u2019s lives, the truth will always outshine anything the other parent could say to them about you. Also, that paragraph about your marriage was completely unnecessary and a waste of reading.", "Looks like you got a lot of mixed judgements here. So I guess you\u2019ll do with that what you will. But I\u2019ll throw in some advice. Let her come on the condition she\u2019s earnest. She was a brainwashed kid and wants to make things right. Telling her she can\u2019t come will only reinforce the ideas her father put into her head and will likely be a final mail in the coffin of your relationship with her. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong, I think it\u2019s about whether or not you\u2019re interested in ever fixing the relationship. Now would be an opportunity to do that. (Adding in a light judgement of ESH in case it\u2019s against the rules to not make a claim).", "NTA.\n\nThere are certain things in life you just cannot walk back. And the fact that you're willing to even have weekly conversations with her, I think, speaks volumes about your forgiveness.\n\nAnd understand, \"Forgiving someone\" does not mean, \"being stupid.\" Forgiving does not mean you have to walk right back into her life, eyes wide shut, and set yourself up for hurt again.\n\nI remember a story someone shared some time ago. Due to their mother's manipulations, a man's children told him that they didn't want him in their lives at all and he should just get lost. After years of struggling with this, he finally reconciled to the fact that his kids were gone for good and was finally able to be happy again. Then his kids showed back up years later, now adult age, realizing their mother's manipulation caused them to say the things they did.\n\nProblem was, he just couldn't do it any more. He wasn't in the best of health, and he couldn't cope with the stress. I told him for the sake of his stress, just tell the kids they burned the bridge and walk away.\n\nBut some Bambi-eyed, na\u00efve responses insisted, \"Oh, let them back into your life. It will do you so much good!\"\n\nUgh! Terrible advice. Did they not read about his health issues and the years of struggling it took him to finally put his kids behind him?\n\nAnd I think her reaction shows that you're wise to be cautious. She calls you names when she doesn't get her way, and she blames others for her decisions. 16 is old enough to know better. And even if this was the result of her father's manipulation, she's 24 now. She's old enough to understand, regardless of how much responsibility her father has, that her comments were hurtful and she should understand why you're taking things slow.\n\nAnd frankly, I think her reaction should put her right back to square one . . . if you decide to speak to her at all.", "YTA. Your child wants to mend fences but you moved on and got a new family. \n\nI know estrangement is hard. Been there for reasons also not my fault. But your kid is your kid. You welcome them back with open arms.", "NTA. You can't force this mother/daughter relationship to suddenly be ok just because you realize her father was manipulating her. That takes time and lots of effort. If you don't feel that the connection is strong enough yet, that's perfectly valid.", "NAH. I think you're wrong, but I understand the primal need to protect yourself. And though it probably wasn't the needed lesson, your daughter learned that actions may have consequences. \n\nYour daughter is holding out an olive branch. You should take it. It's fucking Christmas.", "NAH she is old enough now not to expect you to immediately get over the life ruining situation that she was part of (even though it wasn't her fault). You also need to give her space to be upset that, due to no fault of her own, her mother holds her at arm's length and that hurts badly. I'm sorry for both of you.", "YTA -- You yourself say that your ex and his new wife alienated your daughter from you, and now that she's matured emotionally to the point where she can recognize that and wants to repair your relationship, you're holding on to resentment about how she treated you **when she was a child** instead of welcoming your daughter back into your life.\n\nI understand that you were hurt by what happened. But it's your job as a parent to be more emotionally mature than your kids. If you're struggling to reconnect with your daughter, you at least owe it to her to admit that you have some stuff you need to work through and to either get individual therapy or offer to do family therapy with her. But you are still and always will be her mother, and even though she is an adult, it is incredibly painful for her to have her mom reject her now that she's free of her dad & stepmom's manipulation.", "Absolutely yta. \n\nIt was not her fault. She was manipulated. And now you're punishing her for things her dad did to HER and you. \n\nBE THERE FOR YOUR FUCKIN CHILD. FUCK", "Wow YTA. It really amazes me that you really sat her and wrote this out and don\u2019t see how YTA. No matter what, that is your child. You yourself just sat her and said that there was a lot of parental alienation. You knew that your ex was pitting her against you. She was a child manipulated by her father. Just because shit happens doesn\u2019t mean you stop being a parent. She fucked up, yes. But can you honestly blame her, especially with the situation she was in. She\u2019s trying to have a relationship with you and has apologized for what she\u2019s done and your rejecting her because her manipulative ass father fucked her up. All your doing is reinforcing everything that her father has no doubt told her. Anything bad he has ever said to her is now being backed up with what you just did. You wanted a relationship with her but your butt hurt bc of the brainwashing of her father and now that she sees him for who he is and wants a relationship with you, your not even trying. It\u2019s okay to feel hurt but how she has treated you, but you knew all those things she said was bc of the tricks her father played on her mind and your seriously not gonna even try to see her side?? Come on now.", "NAH. You aren't going to get over it all immediately. I can see the reluctance to go too fast and get your heart broken again, but I can also see how she wants to make up for all the years she missed and doesn't want to miss any more. Keep in mind that her other alternatives may be Christmas alone, or stuck having Christmas with the man who cost her her mother.", "NAH. You told your daughter you\u2019re just not ready yet for her to meet the kids at Xmas, and I think that\u2019s fair.\n\nGL smoothing out your relationships in the future!", "YTA, you\u2019re a parent to three children, whether you like it or not. Act like one.", "My husband and I had a bit of a similar situation with an estrangement from his daughters. After a few years, his older one called us one day to apologize and we started talking. I was pretty wary at first. Then she asked if she could come visit over a holiday and we agreed, though we were both nervous.\n\nIt wasn't until we were in person that she told us more about how her mother had been abusive over the last few years and ended up giving her an ultimatum if she didn't break up with her (wonderful, level headed) boyfriend. She chose the boyfriend and he helped lead her back to us. They're married now and my husband and I were there to celebrate with them. I am grateful for it every day.\n\nWe hope the younger daughter will have a similar change of heart now that she's out of the house but we'll see what happens. My point is that she may only really open up to you in person and, as my stepdaughter told me, you can't blow up the bridge if you ever want your lost loved one to cross it.\n\nCall her. Apologize. Invite her over. \nDo it today.", "YTA. She was the child you were the adult in the situation. Being manipulated by her father wasn't her fault and as much as that hurt you, you shouldn't hold that against her. Put the blame were it belongs, with your ex.I understand wanteding to not get hurt again but she's your daughter who is trying and you can't put the same effort in especially as the one who made her and chose to have her? You might as well told her you've replaced her with kids you didn't make but chose to be their mother. If you really didn't want to reconnect with her, you should have been up front about that instead of stringing her along.

This also caused issues and her own frustration and pain are completely understandable. However, she's now an adult, and she should at least be aware that the whole thing has probably hurt another adult too, her actual mom. \n\nReally, you probably both need some therapy both together and one on one.\n\nI'll go with *NAH*, as long as you both get some counselling together about how to move things forward.", "Choice of words matter.

I don't agree with the people who are saying that you're holding your daughter responsible for the deterioration of your relationship. I think your hurt and fears are justified. At the same time, your daughter does seem to have genuine interest in building a relationship.

This is a challenging situation, and the things said to you that were hurtful by your daughter aren\u2019t things that you have to ignore and pretend didn\u2019t pain you. However, I would encourage you to think about what others have stated: your daughter was a manipulated and brainwashed child. All the anger and resentment you feel belongs towards your ex and his new wife, not your daughter who now, as an adult, has had a recognition and wants to develop something with you that frankly, I think her father wasn\u2019t allowing her to develop or even believe she wanted to develop. Let her in, talk to her (even about the things that hurt you) - this could be the start of something beautiful for the both of you.", "There's so much to unpack here\n\nFirst, your daughter being alienated from you was not her fault.  That is the fault of her father and other adults around her growing up.  It is unfair to her to hold that against her. It is considered abuse and will stand in court as a reason to change custody.  \n\nIf she is reaching out to you to heal the relationship then that means she has realized something was wrong with what she was told as a child and growing up.  \n\nYou don't seem excited or happy that your daughter wants to reconnect.  \n\nBut, courts tend to favor the parent that has the most stability.  Sure you can out money someone with an attorney but family court works a little differently, especially in cases of custody.  From what you wrote, he did not seem the stable parent, judges don't like unemployed parents who live in other people's houses.  \n\nI'm not giving judgment because i really feel like there's some missing missing reasons here.", "NTA -- She's an adult now, and you're under no obligation to have any relationship you don't want to have.

It sounds like she's taking ownership of her behavior, manipulated though she was. With the help of a therapist, you should consider talking to your kids about her and eventually introducing them.

When my daughter turned 5 I started pushing my husband to work, I myself got a job. He didn\u2019t want to. Things escalated and ended up in us getting divorced.\n\nHe got full custody while I got visitations every other Saturday (his dad hired a good lawyer, I couldn\u2019t do that), I also had to pay child support. I used to work a full time and 2 part time jobs to afford my 1 bedroom apartment as well as the child support payments. A year after our divorce, my ex married a new woman.\n\nThere was a lot of child alienation from them, and sadly I couldn\u2019t afford to take them to court again. By the time my daughter turned 14, she was calling me by name and calling her step mom \u201cmom\u201d. I tried my best to hold on to my kid, I went to all the event I could go to, I planned fun days with the limited funds I had, even when I couldn\u2019t afford to turn on the heat, I still made sure to get her a Christmas gift.\n\nSadly by the time she turned 16, she no longer wanted to have anything to do with me. I took them to court, but they did nothing. And the last time I saw her, she said some very awful things to me. I was defeated, but I decided that I no longer had a daughter, since that is literally what she wanted.\n\nI moved away, met a good man, married him and had 2 wonderful kids. Last year my daughter reached out. She was sorry, she said that she wanted to reconnect. I was hesitant and resentful, but I still talk with her once a week.\n\nSuddenly she asked if she could spend Christmas with us, she wanted to get to know her brothers. I told her that we were not in a stage where I could allow that. It got heated, but I told her that I could not trust her with my kids, and that I was still not 100% sure that I wanted our relationship to become more.\n\nShe says that I am an AH, that I am punishing her for things she had no control over, that I know what she told me and how she reacted to me was a direct result of her father\u2019s manipulation.

What your ex did to you by suing you and winning full custody and having you pay child support is a very shitty thing, but that\u2019s ON HIM. Not on her. All the things she said in court about you, I\u2019m willing to bet we\u2019re influenced by years and years of toxicity towards you so it\u2019s easy for her to hate you especially if she\u2019s given everything by her dads family and then sees how hard it is for you to live.

This is no different, she is sadly a stranger and it's okay to time to get to know one another and whether there can be a solid relationship", "NTA.", "NTA \nIt is fair to want to take things slow and be uncertain if you want more. She reached out to you and you talk to her once a freaking week. You do not need to go by the timeline of others. Go at your own pace.", "NTA as someone who experienced this from the child\u2019s perspective your daughters while yes was manipulated was also the one who said and did those that hurt you, forgiveness is a process it doesn\u2019t just happen after I\u2019m sorry. Id invite her to a holiday occasion like Xmas eve or NYE though just to extend the olive branch of forgiveness if you\u2019re up to it", "NTA, give it time.", "NAH.\n\nI think the simple answer here is that you just don\u2019t really know this person. You weren\u2019t given a chance to get to know your daughter. It\u2019s completely fair that you\u2019re not comfortable spending Christmas with her because she doesn\u2019t feel like your daughter.\n\nIt\u2019s also completely fair that she wants to reach out and try to reconnect. She shouldn\u2019t be punished for not accepting you as a mother, as she was most likely influenced by the people who raised her.\n\nNo one is at fault here. But you\u2019re both doing things incorrectly.\n\nFirst, you daughter has every right to attempt to reach out to you and ask for a relationship, but if that relationship doesn\u2019t happen, she does need to accept responsibility for the things she said to you and move on. She will have to work to accept that you just don\u2019t have a relationship.\n\nSecond, you are aiming your resentment at her, when she did nothing wrong. Again, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want her at Christmas, and even if you don\u2019t want a relationship with her, but why are you saying that you can\u2019t trust her around your kids. It sounds like you\u2019re holding her accountable for other peoples actions.\n\nTell her that, while you\u2019re fine with the relationship you have with her now, you\u2019re apprehensive about having her around for major family holidays/events because you just don\u2019t feel close to her. You need to move at your own pace, and she needs to understand that, as much as she may feel damaged by this, you were damaged too. She will just have to be patient. That\u2019s fair.", "NTA\n\nI don't think your daughter is necessarily at fault at all, she was manipulated as a child and seems to understand that.\n\nBut you not wanting her over for Christmas is understandable, because you have other children to consider. \n\nYou and your daughter have a lot to work through before you introduce the little ones to their sister, the relationship between you two is too raw at this point.", "NTA. She needs to realize that she can't just come back into your life like nothing ever happened. The fact that she's blaming her father means she isn't accepting her role in pushing you away. She's got some ulterior motive in asking to have Christmas with you--maybe she isn't getting along with her dad and his new wife so well any more.", "NtA , even though you didn't put what she said to you, I know the words she used for you to realize that so you can't get close to her and decided to end your mother relationship with her. You are not an AH, nor a bad mom. It's been years, you moved on, and she moved on way before you. Now, if she wants a relationship that both she and her dad ended towards you, she should do it in a slow phase. You have your own family now. Blood does not make anyone family... at 16 you know between good and bad. I was 16 a couple of years ago, so I know and my choices were not good and I knew it. Now your choice is yours if you want to build back a relationship with her, call her and we'll apologize and invite her over, Or keep no contact. She still has her beloved dad and step mom.", "NTA, if she is calling you the AH for protecting your family on a newly rebuilding relationship; she hasn\u2019t changed. This is new for the both of you especially with everything that happened before and it shouldn\u2019t be pushed. I would say that the both of you go to therapy in helping rebuild a healthy relationship before adding more hands in the cookie jar", "NTA. Her reaction to you saying no certainly doesn't make me want to have her around the kids. There's a lot of healing on both sides that needs to be done first. Your priority is to your sons who consider you their mother, not a 24 year old trying to turn back time.", "NTA. Setting boundaries with people that have already treated you like that isn't \"punishing\" them for past behavior. It's called protecting yourself from future hurt and protecting your children from potential issues. \n\nA year is not enough time to rebuilt that level of trust, so stick to your boundaries. If she's getting heated over you not doing exactly what she wants, she hasn't matured enough just yet to understand that you have the right to protect yourself and your family from someone that has already proven a risk and isn't doing much to build that trust by trying to force things.\n\nFor those \"But she's was just a teen\", kids can be AH's just like the rest of us. That doesn't mean if you are under 21, you get out of being cruel to people and everyone should forgive you. She gets to live with the consequences of her actions. That would be the loss of one mother and the trust of said mother. OP doesn't have to be the bigger person, she tried. \n\nIf she wants a relationship with the OP, the effort is on her as well as patience with OP as she works through the hurt and pain the daughter caused. If she can't be patient, she isn't ready to mend this relationship.", "NTA.  I\u2019m shocked at some of these cruel comments.  This woman hasn\u2019t been a kid in a while and is just now reaching out and only because her boyfriend suggested it. She had plenty of chances and OP is only doing what she feels is best for her kids and herself.", "NTA\n\nThis is sad, but the hurt you feel from your daughter\u2019s actions is real, and will take time to heal. You have to go at your own pace.", "NTA. But I would suggest you and her go through counseling before you bring her around the kids. Yes she was a teenager at the time but that doesn\u2019t just wipe the acts away. And taking things slow isn\u2019t a punishment for the daughter, it\u2019s being comfortable around each other.  All the people that are calling you the \u00e3h are forgetting that you can forgive and not choose to forget what happened. Forgetting comes with the other person actually showing that they changed. Not just saying \u201cI\u2019ve changed you should forget what happened \u201c.\n\nEdit to correct spelling", "Honestly the only AH in this situation is theex husband and his dad", "This might get me downvoted but NTA.

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s more to the story of the daughters sudden desire to reconcile, and if that is the case I would be concerned too if I were OP.", "First of all I think you're very brave for leaving your ex, it sounds like he was controlling you. And I think you should be proud of your daughter, see has looked herself in the mirror and admits her mistakes. \n\nRight now I would say NTA. I understand your hesitant about connection with your past life and want to move forward. So wants your daughter, and she wants it with you. Maybe not this Christmas, but give her a chance. Maybe next year you can welcome her at the Christmas table", "Get therapy is the best response and do some sessions to work out what issues you have with your daughter.", "YTA. Your feelings/hurt are valid, not being ready/comfortable exposing your kids to such a precarious emotional situation - especially at Christmas - is valid. But YTA for the lack of empathy.

You might live to regret this\u2026she pushed you away when she was  a child, but you *chose* to be a parent and have a child and now you\u2019re pushing her away. You\u2019re probably evidencing the stories she was told about you (ie not caring about her, abandoning her to be selfish and start a *new family*). Why not arrange 1-on-1 time on neutral ground to give your relationship (with *your child*) a chance?", "Unfortunately YTA. It took a lot for your daughter to process what she has experienced in her 24 years. And she has realized she wants you in your life. Every child yearns for a parental connection whether the parent was a good person or not. You are the hole in her heart that has been missing in her life. \n\nI used to say the worst things to my parents as a teenager. But they forgave me because I\u2019m their child and I needed to grown up and learn on my own how important they are in my life. \n\nYou could have offered the olive branch and invited her to Christmas. Christmas and the holidays are a time to reconnect with near and distant family. And to create new memories. You wouldn\u2019t have to have hard conversations then, but in the future. It would just be a time to reconnect over dinner and for her to connect with the family she wants to get to know.\n\nIt may be awkward at first since she is a stranger to you and your family.

Just the way you worded it. You were in a toxic marriage, your DAUGHTER didn\u2019t ask to be born. Seems here was projected feelings towards her because of your ex\u2019s bs. She was a child.", "YTA not for not wanting her to spend Christmas with them but for handling it so poorly!

My little sister unfortunately is now brainwashed and is convinced of a lot of lies involving my father; but that man would help her in a heartbeat if given the option. Being a parent doesn't stop because you feel you weren't treated fairly. You don't get a redo with new kids then get to forget your past. The fact that you haven't decided if you still want a relationship with your kid is honestly messed up.

I know sometimes people are dealt a bad hand from a vindictive or abusive ex despite doing their best but most people I know who claim that they couldn\u2019t be there for their kid or did nothing to deserve their hate are just selfish and didn\u2019t make much if any effort.", "YTA - if this was a dude, there would be no sympathy\u2026.and this is the reality for loads of otherwise good dads. She is your child. Be a parent", "Wow. YTA. This was the last chance to have a relationship with your biological daughter and you threw it back in her face.", "OP: I was young and stupid\n\nAlso OP: How dare my daughter try to come back to me after what she did as a child", "YTA. She is STILL being failed by her parents.", "Kindly YTA. I do understand the pain you must be feeling. Children will break our hearts, and even if you were with her for her entire life, a 16 year old will say some cruel and hateful things. Believing you don't know anything. Breaking your heart. Meanwhile they could be going through emotional hell themselves and are trying to figure out how to navigate life. \n\nWhat good reason do you have to not trust your daughter to not harm your sons? Your sons are plenty old enough for you to say to them \"hey boys. So mommy has a daughter from a marriage before your dad. She's your sister. There were some...challenges that we (mom and mommy's ex) had that you're too young to understand. It caused difficulties in the relationship I had tried to have with your sister. Now that she's older, she would like to get to know me, but more importantly, she would like to meet you two. Her brothers. I don't know how this Christmas will go but would you like to meet your sister? Show her our Christmas traditions and maybe we can have a lot more Christmases with her in the future?\"\n\nI can't imagine your boys will be left without an adult there with them that they know. And she will always technically be their sister because she will always be your biological daughter. So, I personally would probably invite her? If nothing more so the kids know they have an older sister rather than grow up and find out that you never told them about her. If it doesn't work out, then she leaves and you go back to having Christmases with your boys and husband. If it does work out, great. Now you have your daughter back. I just am not understanding what concerns you have. Is it okay in your eyes to ever turn your back on your family? Show her how she should be by example. Welcome her in. Make her feel like family and be the family she never had. There's foster kids who spend Christmas with families that aren't theirs, but they're welcomed anyway.", "YTA - why are you blaming a child for the results of parental alienation. You decided to cut her off for being an alienated teen truly alienating her at that point. You cut off her having her mom fight for her and love her without conditions. So yes YTA. You don\u2019t deserve to have her in your life.\n\nShe wants to finally be included in your life without someone holding her back and you aren\u2019t willing? Bc you put more effort and thought about the gear children than you do your other child who is struggling.", "You are such an immature petty asshole. She is your child. And she didn't have any control over what was happening when she was a kid. She is reaching out to you - her one and only mother, and you're just being mean. Honestly, probably in the same way you were mean to her when she was growing up. Maybe it's for the best you let her be without you, no one needs a mother like you around. Get ready for your boy to say goodbye to you the first chance they get. \n\nYTA", "YTA - your daughter was young and possibly manipulated. It is your job as a parent to AT LEAST hear her out and allow her a relationship with her step/half siblings. You're the adult in this relationship and your daughter did not \"choose\" to be born. Take accountability for having your kid - and don't pawn her off in the name of your 'self care'. You brought her into this world, the resentment you experienced during her childhood is more of a reflection on you ....not on your daughter.", "She just needs a mother. Give her that. \n\nImagine the hurt of wanting to have a relationship with you yet you rejected her. Seeing that you shower your kids now with so much protection and love.. things that she wanted.. yet she can't have that and you made her feel like a dangerous, villainous person.\n\nYou both got to start somewhere. This Christmas must be it. You are the mother so you've got to be a bigger person. It's never to late to let her experience having you in her life. This will further show her the truth about you and change her impression of you. \n\nShe was just a child, manipulated and brainwashed *if that's really the truth* You both have the time to make up for it.", "I really hope OP has a therapist. Something like this happened to me with my daughter and it's taken years to give myself Grace, much less accept that sometimes kids make decisions that...well, decisions you wish they hadn\u2019t made. If my daughter reached out now, I'd be very cautious. It would take more than a year of weekly conversations to have her over because I need boundaries for my mental health. NTA.

If everything is truly as she presents it, she lost her marriage because she insisted her husband get a job, proceeded to lose her child physically to him because he had better lawyers, then lost her child emotionally because the ex turned her against OP, all while working three (!) jobs and not having heat in her home.\n\nThere is absolutely zero acknowledgment of any culpability on OP's part. I'll leave room for the possibility that everything is just as OP says, but I think it's more likely that there is a lot of missing info here.\n\nTaking OP at her word, my verdict is ESH. Daughter can request to stay for Christmas, but OP has the right to say she is not ready for that yet. Daughter has the right to her hurt feelings but becomes TA by lashing out over it. OP is TA because I suspect that a part of her wants to punish her daughter for the way she acted as a child (\"as a child\" being the key point there) by showing her how it feels to be rejected.", "NAH except for your ex. It sounds like you are hitting some of your limits and are understandably conflicted revisiting a relationship after that painful rejection.

You guys would encourage the kid to take the time they need to be ready for a relationship with their parent who mistreated them.\n\nBut you call a parent who isn\u2019t ready for a intimate relationship with the child who treated them like dirt an AH.\n\nDaughter is the AH for trying to rush a reconciliation and trying to do so on a major holiday days before said holiday.", "NTA\n\nYou are treading carefully because its been so long, the last she said towards you was hurtful and you don't want your kids to get hurt.\n\nYou should take at a comfortable pace and reconnect with her one on one.

Period.", "NTA. There\u2019s quite a history here with a lot of pain on both sides. OP is being cautious for a good reason. Younger kids don\u2019t necessarily understand such complex situations. Perhaps she could introduce her daughter slowly to the kids, but not by spending Christmas together. People are making too many assumptions here. However, I do wonder why she suddenly wants to spend Christmas with the person she refused to call \u201cMom.\u201d I wish them the best to heal. You can\u2019t force it.", "INFO: Missing missing reasons.", "I'm sure that mom had her part in it and is not telling the full story.", "We literally only have one side of the story.

Something is amiss...", "Ya I agree the three of them hurt and destroyed you both and your relationship. They are the real AH.", "Yeah, framing it around the kids might be a good way to go. Like an introduction to a sister they've never known before will be an intense experience for them. And you and her have a lot of unresolved issues to work out.

I will field this one! He didn't have a job and he was a felon. I've never been in trouble in my life and I've never been unemployed. He spent 70 grand of his grandmother's retirement and took me to court 76 times. He tried to take my son from me and he is still trying to alienate me from my child even though we have a joint custody agreement and there is NOTHING I can do about it. They let an abuser that admitted to breaking my arms, continually abuse me through the system because there was money involved and he had seen the inside of a court and I never had... He knew what BS it was and he knew what he could get away with. And apparently it's anything if you have money.\n\nEdit: I would also like to add that I took care of my son full time until the age of 3. \n\nHe broke my arms four months postpartum and I couldn't breastfeed anymore. I had casts up to my elbows and I couldn't even wiggle my fingers. He would bathe me every few days after putting garbage bags over my hands, and I would have to sit in the water while he washed my body and then concentrated on specific areas way too long. He would look me in the eye and tell me that I'm so lucky because nobody else would do this for me. He also did that because he had to feed me for a long time. My baby would cry and I would cry even harder because I couldn't pick him up. Someone would pick him up and hold him next to me and I would put my face next to his. My arms were shattered. \n\nMy breasts swelled up with so much milk and I very fortunately didn't get mastitis. His grandmother... Yeah the grandmother that all of that money came from... Had to drive me once a week to Supercuts so they could wash and braid my hair. I would say it's the worst thing that's ever happened to me but someone trying to take my son was by far worse. I would rather have my arms broken over and over and over. I'm crying my eyes out while I type this.\n\nThe second I could wiggle my fingers and open the door.... I was out and I had my child with me. He could honestly care less about my son; he was way more concerned with the fact that I wasn't with him anymore. He stalked me for years. And the second I showed a single interest in somebody else and he found out about it... It was emergency custody order after emergency custody order. \n\nHe abused me through the system because they allowed him to and they had evidence that he broke my arms. It didn't matter. He had lawyers and three of them fired him. He could have sent our son to college two times. \n\nNow I just grit my teeth and I will do anything to see my son. Even though I'm supposed to see him every weekend he has his thumb over everything and his narcissistic ass changes plans all the time.\n\n Trust me I'm taking him back to court at the beginning of the year. I have so much PTSD from the entire situation and I realize that I made my bed because I procreated with him but just because hindsight is 20/20, it doesn't change any of it.", "And as someone else pointed out, if daughter can\u2019t spend Christmas with mom, her options may be alone, or with the father and stepmother she\u2019s now thinking may have alienated her from her mother.", "I'm not sure the daughter has \"deprogrammed\" herself. I agree with your judgement overall. I just think the daughter still has some work to do, simply by looking at her reaction. It took years to destroy their relationship, it will probably take years to repair it.", "This is a super antiquated take, fathers get custody all the time. There is no longer a preference for the mother to have custody and there hasn\u2019t been for decades.", "This is absolutely NOT the case. People are allowed to have boundaries in their life.

OP if you\u2019re not comfortable hosting a non-functional relationship during the holidays, you don\u2019t have to. \n\nIf you were to shut her out completely and not want to attempt repair, then you\u2019re an asshole. But at this stage, holidays are for family, and blood is NOT family. Family is a choice.", "I was alienated against my father by my mother after their divorce. I was absolutely awful to him as a child. I hardly ever saw him and when I did I was a complete brat. When I became an adult, he still treated me like his daughter, whom he loved and wanted the best for. As an adult I ended up being super close to my dad and cutting my mother out of my life. Can't imagine how I'd feel if he decided to just right me off for how I behaved as a manipulated child. OP has the chance to have the relationship with her daughter that she always wanted, free from the alienation of the other parent and here she is proving to her daughter that what her ex said is true. That she doesn't care about her daughter or want anything to do with her.", "How in the hell is this top comment??", "OP don't listen to this stupid comment.", "I don't see anything wrong with being wary of suddenly being contacted. I also don't see anything wrong with going \"it's a bit soon to celebrate the holidays together\", especially if there are concerns of this sudden contact being for potentially troubling reasons.\n\nThat said, turning the daughter away entirely is absolutely the wrong way to go about it. A meeting of mother and daughter (without others present) to talk and see what's going on would be better.\n\nEDIT: I misread the end, I see she's already doing that now. If OP is still having hesitations after meeting her weekly, it might be a good time to address those hesitations with her daughter.", "Idk if I agree. OP said she was not at the point yet that she felt comfortable spending Xmas together. It doesn't really matter at this point why things happened. They happened, the relationship between the two of them needs time to heal. OP didn't say this would never happen. She just needs more time to work on their relationship before introducing her bio kid to her other children and truly embracing her as a member of the family. \n\nIt was not the daughter's fault that she got manipulated by her dad. However, that doesn't change the damage that was done. Just like it wasn't really OPs fault that she was young and dumb and in love and took time to grow a spine, the damage was done. Have they even met face to face since they started talking? Or has it all been phone and/or video call?\n\nBoth of them need to feel comfortable with the relationship. Again, at this point the why and how things happened don't matter (I mean they do but not as far as this particular problem) the result of the how and why is what matters. It's understandable that the daughter would be hurt and upset too. This is a sticky situation because more damage can be done either way (have her come or not come for xmas). \n\nOP be the adult she needed you to be when she was younger. No. It was not her fault that her dad manipulated her when she was a child, just like it's not your fault for how you feel. Talk with her and make sure she understands that it's not a hard no, it's just a not yet. I would suggest to stay away from saying things like \"idk if I want to heal this relationship\" if you actually want to try. If you keep with that mentality, and also tell her that, it really comes off as you don't actually have any intent to ever let the relationship heal. Either put your all into it and do what you can to make things work and be a part of each other's lives, or don't. What you cannot do is stand there with one foot in the door and one foot out the door. You need to make a decision as to what you want and what would be best for you, one way or the other, and then follow through with it. Just because you put your all into healing, doesn't mean it's going to happen. It may wind up that you, or her, or both of you decide there has been to much damage and it just cannot be repaired. You will never be able to get there by staying in limbo though. \n\nIf you decide to try, find a time where you guys can get together and try to make it a regular thing (once a month to start?) And work up from there. Maybe next year things will be different and she can come for Xmas. Just don't leave her hanging on a maybe, because that's not fair to either of you. \n\nDespite what she said and did, remember, she was a child, she was manipulated by at least one person that she was supposed to be able to trust to put her first. He didn't. It's not her fault, just like it's not your fault for not being to fight back on even ground. If you could have hired a lawyer that was just as good, or better, maybe this post would never have been. You're not at fault for not being able to compete with what the ex could get. \n\nAsk yourself, and give yourself a brutally honest answer. In 20 years, what would you regret more...giving jt your all to heal your relationship with your daughter even if it ends up with another broken heart? Or never giving it the chance and not having to risk reopening those wounds that fully? Once you have the answer to that question, then you will know what to do. You either go for it or end it, just stop playing games.\n\nETA: I can't make a judgement here bc you're both. N T A for saying that you're not at the point yet to spend Xmas with her.

Trust me. The daughter really wants something out of it. Maybe even a better relationship with the mother. But there's a motive behind it nonetheless. And it is especially dangerous when you can't spot what people want. A year talking on the phone doesn't really do much for building trust.

You have a new family and you've moved on. Don't let the past ruin your present and future.

And, for other comments I've seen, the people that don't believe that men can lose custody because of bias seem to be people that think moms can do no wrong. Well, we can. Moms can make mistakes. I am proof of that. Thankfully though, with help, I managed to get a great lawyer when my kiddo was still young which helped me tremendously come time for court. People can change. People can grow and mature. \n\nHowever, even talking on the phone, once a week, for a year is not enough time to truly know how the daughter is as a person. I said some pretty stupid stuff to my parents as a teen. But before I hit the age of over 20, I apologized and did my best to try and make up for my mistakes. Has the daughter gone to see her mother? Has the daughter asked to spend ANY time with the mom before now? \n\nWhy the sudden interest in seeing mom after 8 years of belittling her and saying that she isn't mom? What made the change? Why, when mom told her no, did she immediately blow up? There's lots of variables that we can't see, but we can also see that the daughter isn't fully understanding to her mom after being told for 8 years (16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 *daughters ages*) by the daughter that she isn't her mom, that mom holds some intense emotions and just isn't ready, especially at a big event/holiday.", "A whole lot of y\u2019all seem to think that Op should just drop all of the boundaries she\u2019s had to build over the last decade just to appease the daughter.\n\nIt\u2019s not about why the daughter did what she did to OP. It\u2019s the fact that she did, and Op had to learn how to live and cope with that reality. Yes, op was an adult but that doesn\u2019t negate the emotional trauma of fighting so hard for someone, only to have them shut you out and tell you they don\u2019t want you for a mom. \n\nOp is a human being who was hurt, likely profoundly. It is totally reasonable to not want to rush right back into it after just a year of weekly phone calls. She seems like she\u2019s not sure she won\u2019t get hurt again. And sure enough, the moment the daughter didn\u2019t get the response she felt entitled to, she got belligerent. That would make me question whether I wanted to proceed ahead, too. \n\nMothers are human beings. They face traumas like any other human being. They have the right to take the time they need to heal. \n\nAdult children can still be toxic. Childhood manipulation may be a reason for later toxicity, but it doesn\u2019t excuse it. Reconciliation still needs to happen and it has to be at the pace of the person who was mistreated. Not the person who did the mistreating. \n\nThe fact that the daughter immediately jumped to being aggressive when she didn\u2019t get her way tells me that she\u2019s still got work to do on herself before she\u2019s ready to rebuild.

Her emotions were all over the place. Not only did she lose her family. She all of a sudden was only seeing you occasionally. Her dad was probably saying things to her about you. That is really difficult for a child to process. It is possible that she put the pieces together regarding the situation when she was older and realised that she was confused and grieving for the family she had and that is why she said those things.

Yes the money was coming from his family, but  - if they'd already passed away and he'd inherited it, instead of getting it while they were still alive, would she still insist he go work 9 to 5 just for the hell of it? Because that's what men are supposed to do? \n\nIt just rubs me the wrong way, as a former stay at home mom, to see a stay at home parent of any gender labeled as \"unemployed\" as if it's not work.

Sorry but how is this mother an AH when a child didn't feel bad to sit there and say that and now demands for everything to be ok?

At the end of the day, the courts want to maintain the status quo. It boggles my mind how people can pay a lawyer and just sit back.

She walked away from the relationship when her daughter was 16 & gave herself a free pass as something her daughter wanted her to do. Teenagers aren\u2019t known for kindness & compassion and they say shitty things, usually because they\u2019re hurt and angry. OP wouldn\u2019t walk away from her sons if they lash out with hurtful words when they\u2019re 16. Regardless of why she walked away, that is still a rejection from a parent that is supposed to love you unconditionally. The negative reaction to being told no could easily be coming from a place of hurt and a fear of being rejected again by her mother. A year of weekly phone calls is a long time to still keep her at a distance & it probably hurt quite a bit to hear that her mother wasn\u2019t at the same point she was with their relationship.

The OP is definitely an AH for saying stuff like \"I could not trust her with my kids, and that I was still not 100% sure that I wanted our relationship to become more.\" towards her child who was trying to reach out and mend the relationship.\n\nIf the OP can't forgive her own child for being manipulated and saying stupid stuff when she was 16, and doesn't know how to get over that, I wonder how her step-children will get treated when they hit their rebellious phase and say stupid things to her.", "It's relevant to the daughter though. A bit weird of her to ask to become part of their life if they're not actually her brothers at all.", "It seems that it's a concern for *emotional* safety, not that her daughter is a physical danger.", "She was literally speaking once a week over the phone for a whole year, how much smaller and slower can you get?

She's trying to make amends.\n\nIt doesn't mean that OP needs to have her for Christmas. But OP is being petty. This isn't a friend from college or even a sibling. It's a kid.\n\nAlso, anyone who is even capable of saying, \"I have no child\" is an AH. In any situation that you can come up with. Ever.", "It doesn't sound like it had anything to do with her son's safety, but more of she doesn't want to introduce them and have them grow attached, just for her daughte rto changer her mind and walk away again.", "I agree, surely meeting for coffee on a none holiday would be more prudent first, and take it from there as to how both feel around each other, even of they do a monthly coffee for a few months before introducing the new husband, I wouldn't think it wrong. Deciding you want to meet all of the mothers new family and giving just 3 days notice to do so on Xmas is too much. Op needs to take it slowly and that's absolutely normal", "This. In a child/parent relationship, the onus is on the parent to foster a healthy relationship. They\u2019re the one who decided to have a child. OP is the one who decided to marry an unemployed person and then take it a step further and have a child with them. OP is the one who then decided to get a divorce. A 16 year old is a minor, and she had court ordered visitation. So the fact that she hadn\u2019t seen her since 16, was OPs own choice. This whole situation is the consequence of OPs own actions, not those of her daughter, yet she\u2019s the one who is resentful of her daughter who was literally a child when these things were happening? Gross. OP was allowed to feel hurt when her daughter said cruel things to her but it feels like OPs dislike towards her daughter runs deeper than just things she said when she was 16. OP said she resents her. Resentment is a STRONG word to use when referring to your own child. I think there is more to this whole story.", "> op needs to think of her young kids\n\nI think that's an important point.  I had a falling out with my own daughter that was fueled by my ex encouraging the falling out, and I fought for about a half year to fix it, but I had to pull back and stop that when I saw it was affecting my son too.  Her negativity was spilling over and causing my son to be miserable.  I knew that if I kept fighting to keep her, I would lose them *both.*  So I made the heart-breaking decision to let my daughter go as she wished, and almost immediately the relationship with my son repaired.  In fact, it didn't even really need \"repair.\"  The minute we were on our own without her, he was instantly back to being a cool little kid who loved his dad and we did everything together.\n\nPeople have asked if I would ever consider taking my daughter back.  And first, it's a silly thought -- my daughter would never ask to reconcile.  Family members have reached out to her multiple times to make it happen, and she rebuffed every single one.  However, if it *did* happen, I have the same exact concerns as OP: **is this safe to do?**  Is my relationship with my son at risk if I do this?  My son is the only relationship I salvaged from a broken marriage.  He is important in my life.  I value that and I intend to protect that.  If I am bringing someone back into the fold who will bad-mouth me or whisper negative comments to my son or just constantly eye-roll and diminish me... that's not okay.\n\nWe often hear stories about parents who are desperate to reconcile with kids, and we hear talk about \"missing missing reasons\" but there is another group of parents: those who are nervous about a reconciliation.  Should the reconciliation even happen?  How fast?  Is this going to blow up my life?  Am I sure I want to do this?  What's at risk?  I think these are reasonable considerations, and it's OK for adults to say \"once bitten, twice shy, so let's take this slowly please.\"  It's not a \"no\" it's just a \"slow.\"  I feel like that is a fair response.", "Christmas is a bad time to try to introduce a new family member, especially when they haven't even met in person yet. It's emotional and a very bad time for forced intimacy. The request was a bit too much but her reaction would really give me pause. What's to stop another meltdown in front of the entire family when things aren't picture-perfect?

They DO NOT know what it\u2019s like to be manipulated as a child.

Dragging this out longer isn't going to change anything.", "She simply couldn\u2019t afford to raise a child, she couldn\u2019t even afford to heat her apartment at times.  Why would any court side with her for joint custody if that\u2019s the case?

Op hasnt spoken to her child since she was 16 because she got her feelings hurt. Thats a sign of a shitty parent to me, I dont care who argues. Without all the additional context, that right there automatically makes op the asshole, the only way to redeem it is if her ex physically stopped her from seeing or contacting her child.", "yummy paranoia and whataboutism", "True, but she should be self aware enough to know as an adult she can't fast track a reconciliation.", ">Treat me like a leper\n\n...\n\n>Why are you treating me like a leper?", "No, her mum is treating her like the stranger she is.

So sounds like the judge determined continuity of care was in the kid's best interest. It surprises me the mom only got one day though?

Sure the grandpa may have got a solid lawyer, but for the mother to only end up with visitation rights every other Saturday sounds pretty sketch.

Seems like OP would have mentioned that she suspected the daughter had addiction issues, to me at least.  I guess theoretically she could also steal the silverware.\n\nI have four young adult kids.
