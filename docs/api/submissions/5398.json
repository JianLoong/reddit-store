When my daughter turned 5 I started pushing my husband to work, I myself got a job. He didn\u2019t want to. Things escalated and ended up in us getting divorced.\n\nHe got full custody while I got visitations every other Saturday (his dad hired a good lawyer, I couldn\u2019t do that), I also had to pay child support. I used to work a full time and 2 part time jobs to afford my 1 bedroom apartment as well as the child support payments. A year after our divorce, my ex married a new woman.\n\nThere was a lot of child alienation from them, and sadly I couldn\u2019t afford to take them to court again. By the time my daughter turned 14, she was calling me by name and calling her step mom \u201cmom\u201d. I tried my best to hold on to my kid, I went to all the event I could go to, I planned fun days with the limited funds I had, even when I couldn\u2019t afford to turn on the heat, I still made sure to get her a Christmas gift.\n\nSadly by the time she turned 16, she no longer wanted to have anything to do with me. I took them to court, but they did nothing. And the last time I saw her, she said some very awful things to me. I was defeated, but I decided that I no longer had a daughter, since that is literally what she wanted.\n\nI moved away, met a good man, married him and had 2 wonderful kids. Last year my daughter reached out. She was sorry, she said that she wanted to reconnect. I was hesitant and resentful, but I still talk with her once a week.\n\nSuddenly she asked if she could spend Christmas with us, she wanted to get to know her brothers. I told her that we were not in a stage where I could allow that. It got heated, but I told her that I could not trust her with my kids, and that I was still not 100% sure that I wanted our relationship to become more.\n\nShe says that I am an AH, that I am punishing her for things she had no control over, that I know what she told me and how she reacted to me was a direct result of her father\u2019s manipulation. AITA?\n\nEdit: since a nice redditor brought it to my attention, my kids are adopted, she is my only biological child. I am just used to saying that I had kids. They are technically my late SIL\u2019s children, but I raised them these last 7 years.", "created_utc": 1671746592, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsy75i/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_to_spend/", "score": 301, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like every one of them, even the ones with amazing parents who love them and have a healthy strong relationships. It\u2019s a part of growing up and being rebellious. But you moved away and replaced her with a whole other family. And when she grew up alittle and realized how important her mom is to her and tried to reach out you. You don\u2019t trust her around your kids? She is your kid too. What is going to happen when you two \u201cgood\u201d kids get mad and say they wish you weren\u2019t their mom? You going to abandon them and move away again? Y are definitely TA in this. You are a 46 year old woman with a loving and stable household, she is a 24 year old girl who grew up with her parents clearly resenting each other.

Only now her brain is developed and she's allowed to make her own decisions. And your first response to her trying to reach out to you again was to .. . hold a grudge? Against a child? Wow. Neat choice, there.\n\nYou **are** punishing her for things she had no control over. I loved my dad when I was young. As an adult, I realize he was an insanely abusive loser and love my mom more than ever. We grow up and change our minds. Your child had nothing to do with her father, the divorce, the new marriage. None of that.\n\nThe \"I can't trust you\" line is just straight up mean of you. She's a totally different person now from who she was when she was little and your comment borders on cruelty. \"Sorry maybe next year\" would have been far more kind, but instead you took the opportunity to do further damage. Spitefully.\n\nForgive your child. **Your child.** For things that were not in their control and not their fault.  \n\n\nYou're NTA for deciding you'd rather not do Christmas, but YTA for your reasonings and how you did it.", "NTA you can establish a relationship with your daughter. No need to involve the children unless /until it's good between you both. Not fair to the kids I'd she ups and disappears again because she wasn't actually ready or wanted the relationship to begin with", "YTA. A child does not have to love their parent unconditionally, but a parent does have to love their child unconditionally. You're not 100% sure that you want to have a relationship with your daughter because she hurt your feelings when she was 16 and experiencing trauma? Seriously?? Good for your daughter for trying to repair the relationship, but my heart hurts for her that this is how you're handling it. She deserves better. And your other kids deserve better too... I hope they aren't living in fear that if they hurt your feelings, you'll leave them and resent them forever too.", "Info\n\nWhat happened to make her reach out to you? What opened her eyes to her fathers actions?", "Honestly, I'm not sure if you're the asshole or not. I do think you're missing out an opportunity that you might not get again. I don't know when or how she figured out that they'd manipulated her. I think you're angry that she believed any of it and that she said what she said, and while it's legitimate to be angry, if you want a shot at a relationship, you had better step up and welcome her to Christmas. Just be candid, forgiving, and open. Tell her: I was so hurt for so many years--and I recognize that you are not entirely at fault for that--that I'm having difficulty risking having that kind of pain again. The truth is I want a healthy relationship with you and I'm willing to try and I would like you to come.\" I would probably also tell her that if she has questions, you will tell her the truth and you won't sugarcoat anything. Just try to be tactful. NAH", "Op you tried your absolute hardest with her growing up, you even respected her wishes when she cut contact with you. \n\nNow that she's an adult it's good she's trying to get back into contact with you, but she doesn't get to just expect such a leap forward in your relationship. I imagine you're still very hurt and feel tossed aside after trying so hard. Honestly if it was just a regular day I'd be against you, but staying over for Christmas after only a few conversations is awkward. \n\nNTA, you are 100% deserving of being a little weary. You don't owe her anything after doing so much with 0 reciprocation for years.", "Soft YTA. She's made an effort. She apologized for being brainwashed and she wants to get to know her siblings. And you're just saying nope not interested. It wasn't her fault.", "yta.\n\nif what you say is true, she was manipulated into behaving negatively toward you when SHE WAS A CHILD. now she realizes she was wrong and you're trying to punish her.\n\nstop.", "ESH. I believe that you\u2019re being really harsh and kind of rude to your daughter for things she said almost a decade ago as a teenager. BUT, it\u2019s quite obvious that you have some trauma and hurt in this situation. You shouldn\u2019t feel forced to have her for Christmas if you\u2019re not ready, instead you should offer to meet her in person on neutral territory to lay the ground rules of rekindling your relationship. \n\nI feel like the 1 thing that everyone is missing here is that you have been so LC for almost a decade, do you even know your daughter? I wouldn\u2019t trust her with my family either. However, you will be the unequivocal AH if you shut her out without trying which honestly is what you are doing, she is your child just as much as your adopted sons, you need to try to work through these things (and communicate your hurt) in a manner that matches your comfort, but you need to at least communicate that to the daughter. \n\nWe teach kids there are consequences for their actions, but family should be there. As a parent you aren\u2019t communicating the consequences of her actions that hurt you and that you need to find a way to talk to her because of the hurt she caused. And you never know, indirectly she may have the same hurt and resentment that needs to be let out.", "Soft YTA. I imagine it\u2019s hard to trust and forgive, but that\u2019s what you need to do. If you can set aside you\u2019re anger and work toward forgiveness, you may be able to find peace and have a relationship with your daughter. I wish you the best.", "YTA. You\u2019re actively punishing your adult daughter for something that she did as a child. I hope your new family doesn\u2019t end up also being teenagers, or Christ knows you\u2019ll have three children to let down.", "Yep. YTA. Holding what a teenager said in the past against their adult self makes YTA. Especially if her father was influencing her to say those things. No parent on earth would have a relationship with their children if they remained offended for life by things their teens said.\n\nAs the parent you should be making the overture to your adult daughter, but she is more mature than you and is making the effort instead. Saying that you can't trust her with your other kids is an AH thing to say. What evidence do you have that she is a serial killer or anything like that?\n\nAnd BTW, she is a part of your family.", "NTA", "How the hell did he get custody without a job? Good lawyer or not- you had to do some shit not get 50-50", "Will not say you\u2019re the AH or not, but what I will say is kids say things they don\u2019t mean at 16 and quite frankly, well into their twenties. If my mother judged me based on how I was when I was 16, I\u2019d still be the devil; however, I\u2019m completely different now. Forgive your daughter, she was young and really stupid, probably being manipulated by her lazy, controlling father.", "She\u2019s still your freaking daughter no matter how much you want to deny it. All those years, she was probably torn between you and her dad, and now you\u2019re being the asshole to punish her for it.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to reconnect with you for all the years she lost due to a broken bond with you, and now you\u2019re making her feel like she\u2019s not even your daughter anymore. *How dare you* alienate yourself from your own child. *How dare you* reject her.\n\nYou are a shitty mother to do this to your daughter, and congratulations. Here is an Asshole of the Year Award. \ud83e\udd49\n\n**YTA.**\n\nPS. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s child\u2019s fault she was being alienated from her mother by her dad. Parental alienation *is* a form of emotional abuse, and it is never the victim\u2019s fault.", "YTA - this is an opportunity to make the relationship into what you want and you are doing everything you can to make sure it never happens.  Be a mother and make sure she knows she can come to you and talk about the hard stuff from y\u2019all past.  Be a good person.", "I don\u2019t believe and parental alienation. If you are present in your children\u2019s lives, the truth will always outshine anything the other parent could say to them about you. Also, that paragraph about your marriage was completely unnecessary and a waste of reading.", "Looks like you got a lot of mixed judgements here. So I guess you\u2019ll do with that what you will. But I\u2019ll throw in some advice. Let her come on the condition she\u2019s earnest. She was a brainwashed kid and wants to make things right. Telling her she can\u2019t come will only reinforce the ideas her father put into her head and will likely be a final mail in the coffin of your relationship with her. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong, I think it\u2019s about whether or not you\u2019re interested in ever fixing the relationship. Now would be an opportunity to do that. (Adding in a light judgement of ESH in case it\u2019s against the rules to not make a claim).", "NTA.\n\nThere are certain things in life you just cannot walk back. And the fact that you're willing to even have weekly conversations with her, I think, speaks volumes about your forgiveness.\n\nAnd understand, \"Forgiving someone\" does not mean, \"being stupid.\" Forgiving does not mean you have to walk right back into her life, eyes wide shut, and set yourself up for hurt again.\n\nI remember a story someone shared some time ago. Due to their mother's manipulations, a man's children told him that they didn't want him in their lives at all and he should just get lost. After years of struggling with this, he finally reconciled to the fact that his kids were gone for good and was finally able to be happy again. Then his kids showed back up years later, now adult age, realizing their mother's manipulation caused them to say the things they did.\n\nProblem was, he just couldn't do it any more. He wasn't in the best of health, and he couldn't cope with the stress. I told him for the sake of his stress, just tell the kids they burned the bridge and walk away.\n\nBut some Bambi-eyed, na\u00efve responses insisted, \"Oh, let them back into your life. It will do you so much good!\"\n\nUgh! Terrible advice. Did they not read about his health issues and the years of struggling it took him to finally put his kids behind him?\n\nAnd I think her reaction shows that you're wise to be cautious. She calls you names when she doesn't get her way, and she blames others for her decisions. 16 is old enough to know better. And even if this was the result of her father's manipulation, she's 24 now. She's old enough to understand, regardless of how much responsibility her father has, that her comments were hurtful and she should understand why you're taking things slow.\n\nAnd frankly, I think her reaction should put her right back to square one . . . if you decide to speak to her at all.", "YTA. Your child wants to mend fences but you moved on and got a new family. \n\nI know estrangement is hard. Been there for reasons also not my fault. But your kid is your kid. You welcome them back with open arms.", "NTA. You can't force this mother/daughter relationship to suddenly be ok just because you realize her father was manipulating her. That takes time and lots of effort. If you don't feel that the connection is strong enough yet, that's perfectly valid.", "NAH. I think you're wrong, but I understand the primal need to protect yourself. And though it probably wasn't the needed lesson, your daughter learned that actions may have consequences. \n\nYour daughter is holding out an olive branch. You should take it. It's fucking Christmas.", "NAH she is old enough now not to expect you to immediately get over the life ruining situation that she was part of (even though it wasn't her fault). You also need to give her space to be upset that, due to no fault of her own, her mother holds her at arm's length and that hurts badly. I'm sorry for both of you.", "YTA -- You yourself say that your ex and his new wife alienated your daughter from you, and now that she's matured emotionally to the point where she can recognize that and wants to repair your relationship, you're holding on to resentment about how she treated you **when she was a child** instead of welcoming your daughter back into your life.\n\nI understand that you were hurt by what happened. But it's your job as a parent to be more emotionally mature than your kids. If you're struggling to reconnect with your daughter, you at least owe it to her to admit that you have some stuff you need to work through and to either get individual therapy or offer to do family therapy with her. But you are still and always will be her mother, and even though she is an adult, it is incredibly painful for her to have her mom reject her now that she's free of her dad & stepmom's manipulation.", "Absolutely yta. \n\nIt was not her fault. She was manipulated. And now you're punishing her for things her dad did to HER and you. \n\nBE THERE FOR YOUR FUCKIN CHILD. FUCK", "Wow YTA. It really amazes me that you really sat her and wrote this out and don\u2019t see how YTA. No matter what, that is your child. You yourself just sat her and said that there was a lot of parental alienation. You knew that your ex was pitting her against you. She was a child manipulated by her father. Just because shit happens doesn\u2019t mean you stop being a parent. She fucked up, yes. But can you honestly blame her, especially with the situation she was in. She\u2019s trying to have a relationship with you and has apologized for what she\u2019s done and your rejecting her because her manipulative ass father fucked her up. All your doing is reinforcing everything that her father has no doubt told her. Anything bad he has ever said to her is now being backed up with what you just did. You wanted a relationship with her but your butt hurt bc of the brainwashing of her father and now that she sees him for who he is and wants a relationship with you, your not even trying. It\u2019s okay to feel hurt but how she has treated you, but you knew all those things she said was bc of the tricks her father played on her mind and your seriously not gonna even try to see her side?? Come on now.", "NAH. You aren't going to get over it all immediately. I can see the reluctance to go too fast and get your heart broken again, but I can also see how she wants to make up for all the years she missed and doesn't want to miss any more. Keep in mind that her other alternatives may be Christmas alone, or stuck having Christmas with the man who cost her her mother.", "NAH.

Act like one.", "My husband and I had a bit of a similar situation with an estrangement from his daughters. After a few years, his older one called us one day to apologize and we started talking. I was pretty wary at first. Then she asked if she could come visit over a holiday and we agreed, though we were both nervous.\n\nIt wasn't until we were in person that she told us more about how her mother had been abusive over the last few years and ended up giving her an ultimatum if she didn't break up with her (wonderful, level headed) boyfriend. She chose the boyfriend and he helped lead her back to us. They're married now and my husband and I were there to celebrate with them. I am grateful for it every day.\n\nWe hope the younger daughter will have a similar change of heart now that she's out of the house but we'll see what happens. My point is that she may only really open up to you in person and, as my stepdaughter told me, you can't blow up the bridge if you ever want your lost loved one to cross it.\n\nCall her. Apologize. Invite her over. \nDo it today.", "YTA. She was the child you were the adult in the situation. Being manipulated by her father wasn't her fault and as much as that hurt you, you shouldn't hold that against her. Put the blame were it belongs, with your ex.I understand wanteding to not get hurt again but she's your daughter who is trying and you can't put the same effort in especially as the one who made her and chose to have her? You might as well told her you've replaced her with kids you didn't make but chose to be their mother. If you really didn't want to reconnect with her, you should have been up front about that instead of stringing her along.

All the anger and resentment you feel belongs towards your ex and his new wife, not your daughter who now, as an adult, has had a recognition and wants to develop something with you that frankly, I think her father wasn\u2019t allowing her to develop or even believe she wanted to develop.

When my daughter turned 5 I started pushing my husband to work, I myself got a job. He didn\u2019t want to. Things escalated and ended up in us getting divorced.\n\nHe got full custody while I got visitations every other Saturday (his dad hired a good lawyer, I couldn\u2019t do that), I also had to pay child support. I used to work a full time and 2 part time jobs to afford my 1 bedroom apartment as well as the child support payments. A year after our divorce, my ex married a new woman.\n\nThere was a lot of child alienation from them, and sadly I couldn\u2019t afford to take them to court again. By the time my daughter turned 14, she was calling me by name and calling her step mom \u201cmom\u201d. I tried my best to hold on to my kid, I went to all the event I could go to, I planned fun days with the limited funds I had, even when I couldn\u2019t afford to turn on the heat, I still made sure to get her a Christmas gift.\n\nSadly by the time she turned 16, she no longer wanted to have anything to do with me. I took them to court, but they did nothing. And the last time I saw her, she said some very awful things to me. I was defeated, but I decided that I no longer had a daughter, since that is literally what she wanted.\n\nI moved away, met a good man, married him and had 2 wonderful kids. Last year my daughter reached out. She was sorry, she said that she wanted to reconnect. I was hesitant and resentful, but I still talk with her once a week.\n\nSuddenly she asked if she could spend Christmas with us, she wanted to get to know her brothers. I told her that we were not in a stage where I could allow that.

Granted, no one ever got hurt and I didn\u2019t do some actually crazy shit, but the point I\u2019m trying to make here is that we say and we do stupid shit when we\u2019re young. Your daughter is probably influenced A LOT by your ex\u2019s family and by your ex and his new wife. They\u2019ve probably brainwashed her into thinking you\u2019re a bad mother and as a kid you believe these things even if they\u2019re not true but as you get older you start realizing that the people surrounding you are the toxic ones. What your ex did to you by suing you and winning full custody and having you pay child support is a very shitty thing, but that\u2019s ON HIM. Not on her. All the things she said in court about you, I\u2019m willing to bet we\u2019re influenced by years and years of toxicity towards you so it\u2019s easy for her to hate you especially if she\u2019s given everything by her dads family and then sees how hard it is for you to live. She\u2019s still yours. Be a better mother and you can always start slow. Meet outside of the house. There\u2019s so many options\u2026go for a meal, go to the mall, have a picnic, go to a coffee shop. I mean you\u2019re older now too, there\u2019s so much shit you can do OUTSIDE of the home and if you give her the time to reconnect and slowly feel like you can trust her then she can meet her brothers OUTSIDE of the house. You\u2019re speaking as if she\u2019ll kill them but you have so many outdoor and public space options. If there\u2019s one person to point fingers at, it\u2019s your ex. YTA.", "Have you had a REAL conversation with her where you told her that? I mean, she's grown now. And things change a LOT between 14 and 24. She's reached out and seems to be trying to rebuild the bridges that were burned in the past. The only way to really do that is for the two of you to have some real conversations where you both talk about true feelings over what happened and do it with an attitude of seeking to understand the other's viewpoint at that time. Then you can start to move towards building a new relationship, an adult-to-adult one. \n\nYou might want to seek a counselor to help you both through this. It can be really helpful to have a non-involved third party help facilitate the communication for these difficult, emotionally-charged conversations. \n\nIf the holidays this year are too soon to take the leap to total trust, that's fine. I can understand that there may still be a lot of hurdles towards building trust in the relationship. Maybe carve out some time to spend with her, separate from the rest of the family, and explain that you're just not ready yet to blend her in completely. Then float the idea of getting some \"couples\" counseling together to help the two of you get back to a position of trust. \n\nBecause as much as she hurt you, she also was hurt. It's entirely possible that she felt (and was told) that you abandoned her and didn't want her anymore. That's very, very hurtful to a child. You both have healing to do. \n\nSo I'm going to go with NAH for this whole thing. The situation sucks and you both have been harmed by your ex-husband who is the real AH.

A trusted adult is giving them false info and to survive they have to believe it and buy into that world view. I went through this. It took me until I was your daughter\u2019s age to understand how I had been manipulated. It took me longer to address it and hold those responsible accountable. I literally thought I was being a good kid in my teens because that\u2019s what I was told. \n\nYou\u2019re daughter has grown up and is acting like it.

The mom has her priorities right and as an adult at 24, the OP doesn't need a daughter who she hasn't connected with in a long time and is possibly a stranger to her.
