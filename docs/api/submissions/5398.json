When my daughter turned 5 I started pushing my husband to work, I myself got a job. He didn\u2019t want to. Things escalated and ended up in us getting divorced.\n\nHe got full custody while I got visitations every other Saturday (his dad hired a good lawyer, I couldn\u2019t do that), I also had to pay child support. I used to work a full time and 2 part time jobs to afford my 1 bedroom apartment as well as the child support payments. A year after our divorce, my ex married a new woman.\n\nThere was a lot of child alienation from them, and sadly I couldn\u2019t afford to take them to court again. By the time my daughter turned 14, she was calling me by name and calling her step mom \u201cmom\u201d. I tried my best to hold on to my kid, I went to all the event I could go to, I planned fun days with the limited funds I had, even when I couldn\u2019t afford to turn on the heat, I still made sure to get her a Christmas gift.\n\nSadly by the time she turned 16, she no longer wanted to have anything to do with me. I took them to court, but they did nothing. And the last time I saw her, she said some very awful things to me. I was defeated, but I decided that I no longer had a daughter, since that is literally what she wanted.\n\nI moved away, met a good man, married him and had 2 wonderful kids. Last year my daughter reached out. She was sorry, she said that she wanted to reconnect. I was hesitant and resentful, but I still talk with her once a week.\n\nSuddenly she asked if she could spend Christmas with us, she wanted to get to know her brothers. I told her that we were not in a stage where I could allow that. It got heated, but I told her that I could not trust her with my kids, and that I was still not 100% sure that I wanted our relationship to become more.\n\nShe says that I am an AH, that I am punishing her for things she had no control over, that I know what she told me and how she reacted to me was a direct result of her father\u2019s manipulation. AITA?\n\nEdit: since a nice redditor brought it to my attention, my kids are adopted, she is my only biological child. I am just used to saying that I had kids. They are technically my late SIL\u2019s children, but I raised them these last 7 years.", "created_utc": 1671746592, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsy75i/aita_for_not_allowing_my_daughter_to_spend/", "score": 3276, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So I moved away, met a good man\u2026\u201d YTA for this. EVERY teenager has been hateful to their parent and wished they had different parents. Like every one of them, even the ones with amazing parents who love them and have a healthy strong relationships. It\u2019s a part of growing up and being rebellious. But you moved away and replaced her with a whole other family. And when she grew up alittle and realized how important her mom is to her and tried to reach out you. You don\u2019t trust her around your kids? She is your kid too. What is going to happen when you two \u201cgood\u201d kids get mad and say they wish you weren\u2019t their mom? You going to abandon them and move away again? Y are definitely TA in this. You are a 46 year old woman with a loving and stable household, she is a 24 year old girl who grew up with her parents clearly resenting each other.

Only now her brain is developed and she's allowed to make her own decisions. And your first response to her trying to reach out to you again was to .. . hold a grudge? Against a child? Wow. Neat choice, there.\n\nYou **are** punishing her for things she had no control over. I loved my dad when I was young. As an adult, I realize he was an insanely abusive loser and love my mom more than ever. We grow up and change our minds. Your child had nothing to do with her father, the divorce, the new marriage. None of that.\n\nThe \"I can't trust you\" line is just straight up mean of you. She's a totally different person now from who she was when she was little and your comment borders on cruelty. \"Sorry maybe next year\" or \"How about we start slow\" or even \"Give me a little time to think on it\" would have been far more kind, but instead you took the opportunity to do further damage. Spitefully.\n\nForgive your child. **Your child.** For things that were not in their control and not their fault.\n\nYou're NTA for deciding you'd rather not do Christmas, but YTA for your reasonings and how you did it.", "NTA you can establish a relationship with your daughter. No need to involve the children unless /until it's good between you both. Not fair to the kids I'd she ups and disappears again because she wasn't actually ready or wanted the relationship to begin with", "YTA. A child does not have to love their parent unconditionally, but a parent does have to love their child unconditionally. You're not 100% sure that you want to have a relationship with your daughter because she hurt your feelings when she was 16 and experiencing trauma? Seriously?? Good for your daughter for trying to repair the relationship, but my heart hurts for her that this is how you're handling it. She deserves better. And your other kids deserve better too... I hope they aren't living in fear that if they hurt your feelings, you'll leave them and resent them forever too.", "Info\n\nWhat happened to make her reach out to you? What opened her eyes to her fathers actions?", "Honestly, I'm not sure if you're the asshole or not. I do think you're missing out an opportunity that you might not get again. I don't know when or how she figured out that they'd manipulated her. I think you're angry that she believed any of it and that she said what she said, and while it's legitimate to be angry, if you want a shot at a relationship, you had better step up and welcome her to Christmas. Just be candid, forgiving, and open. Tell her: I was so hurt for so many years--and I recognize that you are not entirely at fault for that--that I'm having difficulty risking having that kind of pain again. The truth is I want a healthy relationship with you and I'm willing to try and I would like you to come.\" I would probably also tell her that if she has questions, you will tell her the truth and you won't sugarcoat anything. Just try to be tactful. NAH", "Op you tried your absolute hardest with her growing up, you even respected her wishes when she cut contact with you. \n\nNow that she's an adult it's good she's trying to get back into contact with you, but she doesn't get to just expect such a leap forward in your relationship. I imagine you're still very hurt and feel tossed aside after trying so hard. Honestly if it was just a regular day I'd be against you, but staying over for Christmas after only a few conversations is awkward. \n\nNTA, you are 100% deserving of being a little weary. You don't owe her anything after doing so much with 0 reciprocation for years.", "Soft YTA. She's made an effort. She apologized for being brainwashed and she wants to get to know her siblings. And you're just saying nope not interested. It wasn't her fault.", "yta.\n\nif what you say is true, she was manipulated into behaving negatively toward you when SHE WAS A CHILD. now she realizes she was wrong and you're trying to punish her.\n\nstop.", "ESH. I believe that you\u2019re being really harsh and kind of rude to your daughter for things she said almost a decade ago as a teenager. BUT, it\u2019s quite obvious that you have some trauma and hurt in this situation. You shouldn\u2019t feel forced to have her for Christmas if you\u2019re not ready, instead you should offer to meet her in person on neutral territory to lay the ground rules of rekindling your relationship. \n\nI feel like the 1 thing that everyone is missing here is that you have been so LC for almost a decade, do you even know your daughter? I wouldn\u2019t trust her with my family either. However, you will be the unequivocal AH if you shut her out without trying which honestly is what you are doing, she is your child just as much as your adopted sons, you need to try to work through these things (and communicate your hurt) in a manner that matches your comfort, but you need to at least communicate that to the daughter. \n\nWe teach kids there are consequences for their actions, but family should be there. As a parent you aren\u2019t communicating the consequences of her actions that hurt you and that you need to find a way to talk to her because of the hurt she caused. And you never know, indirectly she may have the same hurt and resentment that needs to be let out.", "Soft YTA. I imagine it\u2019s hard to trust and forgive, but that\u2019s what you need to do. If you can set aside you\u2019re anger and work toward forgiveness, you may be able to find peace and have a relationship with your daughter. I wish you the best.", "YTA. You\u2019re actively punishing your adult daughter for something that she did as a child. I hope your new family doesn\u2019t end up also being teenagers, or Christ knows you\u2019ll have three children to let down.", "Yep. YTA. Holding what a teenager said in the past against their adult self makes YTA. Especially if her father was influencing her to say those things. No parent on earth would have a relationship with their children if they remained offended for life by things their teens said.\n\nAs the parent you should be making the overture to your adult daughter, but she is more mature than you and is making the effort instead. Saying that you can't trust her with your other kids is an AH thing to say. What evidence do you have that she is a serial killer or anything like that?\n\nAnd BTW, she is a part of your family.", "NTA", "How the hell did he get custody without a job? Good lawyer or not- you had to do some shit not get 50-50", "Will not say you\u2019re the AH or not, but what I will say is kids say things they don\u2019t mean at 16 and quite frankly, well into their twenties. If my mother judged me based on how I was when I was 16, I\u2019d still be the devil; however, I\u2019m completely different now. Forgive your daughter, she was young and really stupid, probably being manipulated by her lazy, controlling father.", "She\u2019s still your freaking daughter no matter how much you want to deny it. All those years, she was probably torn between you and her dad, and now you\u2019re being the asshole to punish her for it.\n\nShe\u2019s trying to reconnect with you for all the years she lost due to a broken bond with you, and now you\u2019re making her feel like she\u2019s not even your daughter anymore. *How dare you* alienate yourself from your own child. *How dare you* reject her.\n\nYou are a shitty mother to do this to your daughter, and congratulations. Here is an Asshole of the Year Award. \ud83e\udd49\n\n**YTA.**\n\nPS. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s child\u2019s fault she was being alienated from her mother by her dad. Parental alienation *is* a form of emotional abuse, and it is never the victim\u2019s fault.", "YTA - this is an opportunity to make the relationship into what you want and you are doing everything you can to make sure it never happens.  Be a mother and make sure she knows she can come to you and talk about the hard stuff from y\u2019all past.  Be a good person.", "I don\u2019t believe and parental alienation. If you are present in your children\u2019s lives, the truth will always outshine anything the other parent could say to them about you. Also, that paragraph about your marriage was completely unnecessary and a waste of reading.", "Looks like you got a lot of mixed judgements here. So I guess you\u2019ll do with that what you will. But I\u2019ll throw in some advice. Let her come on the condition she\u2019s earnest. She was a brainwashed kid and wants to make things right. Telling her she can\u2019t come will only reinforce the ideas her father put into her head and will likely be a final mail in the coffin of your relationship with her. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong, I think it\u2019s about whether or not you\u2019re interested in ever fixing the relationship. Now would be an opportunity to do that. (Adding in a light judgement of ESH in case it\u2019s against the rules to not make a claim).", "NTA.\n\nThere are certain things in life you just cannot walk back. And the fact that you're willing to even have weekly conversations with her, I think, speaks volumes about your forgiveness.\n\nAnd understand, \"Forgiving someone\" does not mean, \"being stupid.\" Forgiving does not mean you have to walk right back into her life, eyes wide shut, and set yourself up for hurt again.\n\nI remember a story someone shared some time ago. Due to their mother's manipulations, a man's children told him that they didn't want him in their lives at all and he should just get lost. After years of struggling with this, he finally reconciled to the fact that his kids were gone for good and was finally able to be happy again. Then his kids showed back up years later, now adult age, realizing their mother's manipulation caused them to say the things they did.\n\nProblem was, he just couldn't do it any more. He wasn't in the best of health, and he couldn't cope with the stress. I told him for the sake of his stress, just tell the kids they burned the bridge and walk away.\n\nBut some Bambi-eyed, na\u00efve responses insisted, \"Oh, let them back into your life. It will do you so much good!\"\n\nUgh! Terrible advice. Did they not read about his health issues and the years of struggling it took him to finally put his kids behind him?\n\nAnd I think her reaction shows that you're wise to be cautious. She calls you names when she doesn't get her way, and she blames others for her decisions. 16 is old enough to know better. And even if this was the result of her father's manipulation, she's 24 now. She's old enough to understand, regardless of how much responsibility her father has, that her comments were hurtful and she should understand why you're taking things slow.\n\nAnd frankly, I think her reaction should put her right back to square one . . . if you decide to speak to her at all.", "YTA. Your child wants to mend fences but you moved on and got a new family. \n\nI know estrangement is hard. Been there for reasons also not my fault. But your kid is your kid. You welcome them back with open arms.", "NTA. You can't force this mother/daughter relationship to suddenly be ok just because you realize her father was manipulating her. That takes time and lots of effort. If you don't feel that the connection is strong enough yet, that's perfectly valid.", "NAH. I think you're wrong, but I understand the primal need to protect yourself. And though it probably wasn't the needed lesson, your daughter learned that actions may have consequences. \n\nYour daughter is holding out an olive branch. You should take it. It's fucking Christmas.", "NAH she is old enough now not to expect you to immediately get over the life ruining situation that she was part of (even though it wasn't her fault). You also need to give her space to be upset that, due to no fault of her own, her mother holds her at arm's length and that hurts badly. I'm sorry for both of you.", "YTA -- You yourself say that your ex and his new wife alienated your daughter from you, and now that she's matured emotionally to the point where she can recognize that and wants to repair your relationship, you're holding on to resentment about how she treated you **when she was a child** instead of welcoming your daughter back into your life.\n\nI understand that you were hurt by what happened. But it's your job as a parent to be more emotionally mature than your kids. If you're struggling to reconnect with your daughter, you at least owe it to her to admit that you have some stuff you need to work through and to either get individual therapy or offer to do family therapy with her. But you are still and always will be her mother, and even though she is an adult, it is incredibly painful for her to have her mom reject her now that she's free of her dad & stepmom's manipulation.", "Absolutely yta. \n\nIt was not her fault. She was manipulated. And now you're punishing her for things her dad did to HER and you. \n\nBE THERE FOR YOUR FUCKIN CHILD. FUCK", "Wow YTA. It really amazes me that you really sat her and wrote this out and don\u2019t see how YTA. No matter what, that is your child. You yourself just sat her and said that there was a lot of parental alienation. You knew that your ex was pitting her against you. She was a child manipulated by her father. Just because shit happens doesn\u2019t mean you stop being a parent. She fucked up, yes. But can you honestly blame her, especially with the situation she was in. She\u2019s trying to have a relationship with you and has apologized for what she\u2019s done and your rejecting her because her manipulative ass father fucked her up. All your doing is reinforcing everything that her father has no doubt told her. Anything bad he has ever said to her is now being backed up with what you just did. You wanted a relationship with her but your butt hurt bc of the brainwashing of her father and now that she sees him for who he is and wants a relationship with you, your not even trying. It\u2019s okay to feel hurt but how she has treated you, but you knew all those things she said was bc of the tricks her father played on her mind and your seriously not gonna even try to see her side?? Come on now.", "NAH. You aren't going to get over it all immediately. I can see the reluctance to go too fast and get your heart broken again, but I can also see how she wants to make up for all the years she missed and doesn't want to miss any more. Keep in mind that her other alternatives may be Christmas alone, or stuck having Christmas with the man who cost her her mother.", "NAH. You told your daughter you\u2019re just not ready yet for her to meet the kids at Xmas, and I think that\u2019s fair.\n\nGL smoothing out your relationships in the future!", "YTA, you\u2019re a parent to three children, whether you like it or not. Act like one.", "My husband and I had a bit of a similar situation with an estrangement from his daughters. After a few years, his older one called us one day to apologize and we started talking. I was pretty wary at first. Then she asked if she could come visit over a holiday and we agreed, though we were both nervous.\n\nIt wasn't until we were in person that she told us more about how her mother had been abusive over the last few years and ended up giving her an ultimatum if she didn't break up with her (wonderful, level headed) boyfriend. She chose the boyfriend and he helped lead her back to us. They're married now and my husband and I were there to celebrate with them. I am grateful for it every day.\n\nWe hope the younger daughter will have a similar change of heart now that she's out of the house but we'll see what happens. My point is that she may only really open up to you in person and, as my stepdaughter told me, you can't blow up the bridge if you ever want your lost loved one to cross it.\n\nCall her. Apologize. Invite her over. \nDo it today.", "YTA. She was the child you were the adult in the situation. Being manipulated by her father wasn't her fault and as much as that hurt you, you shouldn't hold that against her. Put the blame were it belongs, with your ex.I understand wanteding to not get hurt again but she's your daughter who is trying and you can't put the same effort in especially as the one who made her and chose to have her? You might as well told her you've replaced her with kids you didn't make but chose to be their mother. If you really didn't want to reconnect with her, you should have been up front about that instead of stringing her along.

This also caused issues and her own frustration and pain are completely understandable. However, she's now an adult, and she should at least be aware that the whole thing has probably hurt another adult too, her actual mom. \n\nReally, you probably both need some therapy both together and one on one.\n\nI'll go with *NAH*, as long as you both get some counselling together about how to move things forward.", "Choice of words matter.

I don't agree with the people who are saying that you're holding your daughter responsible for the deterioration of your relationship. I think your hurt and fears are justified. At the same time, your daughter does seem to have genuine interest in building a relationship.

This is a challenging situation, and the things said to you that were hurtful by your daughter aren\u2019t things that you have to ignore and pretend didn\u2019t pain you. However, I would encourage you to think about what others have stated: your daughter was a manipulated and brainwashed child. All the anger and resentment you feel belongs towards your ex and his new wife, not your daughter who now, as an adult, has had a recognition and wants to develop something with you that frankly, I think her father wasn\u2019t allowing her to develop or even believe she wanted to develop. Let her in, talk to her (even about the things that hurt you) - this could be the start of something beautiful for the both of you.", "There's so much to unpack here\n\nFirst, your daughter being alienated from you was not her fault.  That is the fault of her father and other adults around her growing up.  It is unfair to her to hold that against her. It is considered abuse and will stand in court as a reason to change custody.  \n\nIf she is reaching out to you to heal the relationship then that means she has realized something was wrong with what she was told as a child and growing up.  \n\nYou don't seem excited or happy that your daughter wants to reconnect.  \n\nBut, courts tend to favor the parent that has the most stability.  Sure you can out money someone with an attorney but family court works a little differently, especially in cases of custody.  From what you wrote, he did not seem the stable parent, judges don't like unemployed parents who live in other people's houses.  \n\nI'm not giving judgment because i really feel like there's some missing missing reasons here.", "NTA -- She's an adult now, and you're under no obligation to have any relationship you don't want to have.

It sounds like she's taking ownership of her behavior, manipulated though she was. With the help of a therapist, you should consider talking to your kids about her and eventually introducing them.

When my daughter turned 5 I started pushing my husband to work, I myself got a job. He didn\u2019t want to. Things escalated and ended up in us getting divorced.\n\nHe got full custody while I got visitations every other Saturday (his dad hired a good lawyer, I couldn\u2019t do that), I also had to pay child support. I used to work a full time and 2 part time jobs to afford my 1 bedroom apartment as well as the child support payments. A year after our divorce, my ex married a new woman.\n\nThere was a lot of child alienation from them, and sadly I couldn\u2019t afford to take them to court again. By the time my daughter turned 14, she was calling me by name and calling her step mom \u201cmom\u201d. I tried my best to hold on to my kid, I went to all the event I could go to, I planned fun days with the limited funds I had, even when I couldn\u2019t afford to turn on the heat, I still made sure to get her a Christmas gift.\n\nSadly by the time she turned 16, she no longer wanted to have anything to do with me. I took them to court, but they did nothing. And the last time I saw her, she said some very awful things to me. I was defeated, but I decided that I no longer had a daughter, since that is literally what she wanted.\n\nI moved away, met a good man, married him and had 2 wonderful kids. Last year my daughter reached out. She was sorry, she said that she wanted to reconnect. I was hesitant and resentful, but I still talk with her once a week.\n\nSuddenly she asked if she could spend Christmas with us, she wanted to get to know her brothers. I told her that we were not in a stage where I could allow that. It got heated, but I told her that I could not trust her with my kids, and that I was still not 100% sure that I wanted our relationship to become more.\n\nShe says that I am an AH, that I am punishing her for things she had no control over, that I know what she told me and how she reacted to me was a direct result of her father\u2019s manipulation.

What your ex did to you by suing you and winning full custody and having you pay child support is a very shitty thing, but that\u2019s ON HIM. Not on her. All the things she said in court about you, I\u2019m willing to bet we\u2019re influenced by years and years of toxicity towards you so it\u2019s easy for her to hate you especially if she\u2019s given everything by her dads family and then sees how hard it is for you to live.

This is no different, she is sadly a stranger and it's okay to time to get to know one another and whether there can be a solid relationship", "NTA.", "NTA \nIt is fair to want to take things slow and be uncertain if you want more. She reached out to you and you talk to her once a freaking week. You do not need to go by the timeline of others. Go at your own pace.", "NTA as someone who experienced this from the child\u2019s perspective your daughters while yes was manipulated was also the one who said and did those that hurt you, forgiveness is a process it doesn\u2019t just happen after I\u2019m sorry. Id invite her to a holiday occasion like Xmas eve or NYE though just to extend the olive branch of forgiveness if you\u2019re up to it", "NTA, give it time.", "NAH.\n\nI think the simple answer here is that you just don\u2019t really know this person. You weren\u2019t given a chance to get to know your daughter. It\u2019s completely fair that you\u2019re not comfortable spending Christmas with her because she doesn\u2019t feel like your daughter.\n\nIt\u2019s also completely fair that she wants to reach out and try to reconnect. She shouldn\u2019t be punished for not accepting you as a mother, as she was most likely influenced by the people who raised her.\n\nNo one is at fault here. But you\u2019re both doing things incorrectly.\n\nFirst, you daughter has every right to attempt to reach out to you and ask for a relationship, but if that relationship doesn\u2019t happen, she does need to accept responsibility for the things she said to you and move on. She will have to work to accept that you just don\u2019t have a relationship.\n\nSecond, you are aiming your resentment at her, when she did nothing wrong. Again, it\u2019s fine if you don\u2019t want her at Christmas, and even if you don\u2019t want a relationship with her, but why are you saying that you can\u2019t trust her around your kids. It sounds like you\u2019re holding her accountable for other peoples actions.\n\nTell her that, while you\u2019re fine with the relationship you have with her now, you\u2019re apprehensive about having her around for major family holidays/events because you just don\u2019t feel close to her. You need to move at your own pace, and she needs to understand that, as much as she may feel damaged by this, you were damaged too. She will just have to be patient. That\u2019s fair.", "NTA\n\nI don't think your daughter is necessarily at fault at all, she was manipulated as a child and seems to understand that.\n\nBut you not wanting her over for Christmas is understandable, because you have other children to consider. \n\nYou and your daughter have a lot to work through before you introduce the little ones to their sister, the relationship between you two is too raw at this point.", "NTA. She needs to realize that she can't just come back into your life like nothing ever happened. The fact that she's blaming her father means she isn't accepting her role in pushing you away. She's got some ulterior motive in asking to have Christmas with you--maybe she isn't getting along with her dad and his new wife so well any more.", "NtA , even though you didn't put what she said to you, I know the words she used for you to realize that so you can't get close to her and decided to end your mother relationship with her. You are not an AH, nor a bad mom. It's been years, you moved on, and she moved on way before you. Now, if she wants a relationship that both she and her dad ended towards you, she should do it in a slow phase. You have your own family now. Blood does not make anyone family... at 16 you know between good and bad. I was 16 a couple of years ago, so I know and my choices were not good and I knew it. Now your choice is yours if you want to build back a relationship with her, call her and we'll apologize and invite her over, Or keep no contact. She still has her beloved dad and step mom.", "NTA, if she is calling you the AH for protecting your family on a newly rebuilding relationship; she hasn\u2019t changed. This is new for the both of you especially with everything that happened before and it shouldn\u2019t be pushed. I would say that the both of you go to therapy in helping rebuild a healthy relationship before adding more hands in the cookie jar", "NTA. Her reaction to you saying no certainly doesn't make me want to have her around the kids. There's a lot of healing on both sides that needs to be done first. Your priority is to your sons who consider you their mother, not a 24 year old trying to turn back time.", "NTA. Setting boundaries with people that have already treated you like that isn't \"punishing\" them for past behavior. It's called protecting yourself from future hurt and protecting your children from potential issues. \n\nA year is not enough time to rebuilt that level of trust, so stick to your boundaries. If she's getting heated over you not doing exactly what she wants, she hasn't matured enough just yet to understand that you have the right to protect yourself and your family from someone that has already proven a risk and isn't doing much to build that trust by trying to force things.\n\nFor those \"But she's was just a teen\", kids can be AH's just like the rest of us. That doesn't mean if you are under 21, you get out of being cruel to people and everyone should forgive you. She gets to live with the consequences of her actions. That would be the loss of one mother and the trust of said mother. OP doesn't have to be the bigger person, she tried. \n\nIf she wants a relationship with the OP, the effort is on her as well as patience with OP as she works through the hurt and pain the daughter caused. If she can't be patient, she isn't ready to mend this relationship.", "NTA.  I\u2019m shocked at some of these cruel comments.  This woman hasn\u2019t been a kid in a while and is just now reaching out and only because her boyfriend suggested it. She had plenty of chances and OP is only doing what she feels is best for her kids and herself.", "NTA\n\nThis is sad, but the hurt you feel from your daughter\u2019s actions is real, and will take time to heal. You have to go at your own pace.", "NTA. But I would suggest you and her go through counseling before you bring her around the kids. Yes she was a teenager at the time but that doesn\u2019t just wipe the acts away. And taking things slow isn\u2019t a punishment for the daughter, it\u2019s being comfortable around each other.  All the people that are calling you the \u00e3h are forgetting that you can forgive and not choose to forget what happened. Forgetting comes with the other person actually showing that they changed. Not just saying \u201cI\u2019ve changed you should forget what happened \u201c.\n\nEdit to correct spelling", "Honestly the only AH in this situation is theex husband and his dad", "This might get me downvoted but NTA.

I\u2019m wondering if there\u2019s more to the story of the daughters sudden desire to reconcile, and if that is the case I would be concerned too if I were OP.", "First of all I think you're very brave for leaving your ex, it sounds like he was controlling you. And I think you should be proud of your daughter, see has looked herself in the mirror and admits her mistakes. \n\nRight now I would say NTA. I understand your hesitant about connection with your past life and want to move forward. So wants your daughter, and she wants it with you. Maybe not this Christmas, but give her a chance. Maybe next year you can welcome her at the Christmas table", "Get therapy is the best response and do some sessions to work out what issues you have with your daughter.", "YTA. Your feelings/hurt are valid, not being ready/comfortable exposing your kids to such a precarious emotional situation - especially at Christmas - is valid. But YTA for the lack of empathy. You were manipulated by the same person too. And 16yr olds aren\u2019t mentally/psychologically fully developed yet (/sometimes say awful things regardless). You might live to regret this\u2026she pushed you away when she was  a child, but you *chose* to be a parent and have a child and now you\u2019re pushing her away. You\u2019re probably evidencing the stories she was told about you (ie not caring about her, abandoning her to be selfish and start a *new family*). Why not arrange 1-on-1 time on neutral ground to give your relationship (with *your child*) a chance?", "Unfortunately YTA. It took a lot for your daughter to process what she has experienced in her 24 years. And she has realized she wants you in your life. Every child yearns for a parental connection whether the parent was a good person or not. You are the hole in her heart that has been missing in her life. \n\nI used to say the worst things to my parents as a teenager. But they forgave me because I\u2019m their child and I needed to grown up and learn on my own how important they are in my life. \n\nYou could have offered the olive branch and invited her to Christmas. Christmas and the holidays are a time to reconnect with near and distant family. And to create new memories. You wouldn\u2019t have to have hard conversations then, but in the future. It would just be a time to reconnect over dinner and for her to connect with the family she wants to get to know.\n\nIt may be awkward at first since she is a stranger to you and your family.

Just the way you worded it. You were in a toxic marriage, your DAUGHTER didn\u2019t ask to be born. Seems here was projected feelings towards her because of your ex\u2019s bs. She was a child.", "YTA not for not wanting her to spend Christmas with them but for handling it so poorly! You have been in touch for a year, you could have done more to spend time with her, you could be more forgiving of someone who has been utterly manipulated and said some stupid things when they were a child but instead of treating her with love and acceptance you punish her and push her away.

As a kid I told my father I wanted nothing to do with him. Things with my mother were bad and when I realized that he took me in no question. My little sister unfortunately is now brainwashed and is convinced of a lot of lies involving my father; but that man would help her in a heartbeat if given the option. Being a parent doesn't stop because you feel you weren't treated fairly. You don't get a redo with new kids then get to forget your past. The fact that you haven't decided if you still want a relationship with your kid is honestly messed up.

What about all that time in between? Parents are not emotional punching bags that should just get over negative emotions/memories because teenager said it. Get real.", "16 year olds are also young enough to still be easily manipulated, which is what happened here. 16 year olds are known for stupid decisions, especially when there is manipulation - even more so when it's an authority figure they understandably believe they can trust. Holding 16 year olds to the same standards as full grown adults is a recipe for disaster.", "And also capable of telling a judge in a custody battle who they'd rather be with. The judge will consider that.\n\nThe biggest AHs here truly are the father for using his father's money to manipulate this mess and said father for capitulating. I can emphasize with OP for feeling used. At the same time, her only biological daughter is trying to make amends, and she should warm up to that.\n\nI say ESH, as her daughter could've made amends sooner, and OP should be more trusting. But dad and paternal granddad are the biggest AHs here.", "OP herself was an actual, true adult who fell for that man's manipulation. 16 is a child and she's being held to a higher standard.", "But not an infant. Just... Lol.", "And never accepted responsibility, just passed the buck to her father. \n\nWhen you do someone a wrong, whether you are family or not, a sincere, heartfelt apology must happen somewhere along the line in order for the relationship to move forward and forgiveness to happen. The OP did not mention anything like that happening.", "It does make sense that Dad alienated her.\n\nDoes it not also make sense that Mom went through/is going through one of the most psychologically stressful events a parent can experience and needs time to process it, if she ever does? \n\nDoes it not make sense that some hurts are so deep that they might never heal and therefore can never be forgiven.\n\nDoes it not make sense that Mom is just a human being with all the same failings as the rest of us, and therefore cannot in any way be expected to be perfect?", ">I told her that I could not trust her with my kids, and that **I was still not 100% sure that I wanted our relationship to become more.**\n\nI don't think the daughter's reaction was only about Christmas. That would *hurt* to hear.", "I wonder what the ex\u2019s side of the story is.  It is rare for a mother to only get custody every other Saturday regardless of the quality of lawyer.\n\nI feel like a lot of the story was left out, and am hesitant to blame the ex for everything.", "So does OP who is harboring a grudge against her daughter who was a child when she hurt her. She says no to Christmas but has no counter-offer that doesn't involve a holiday or spending time with her family; she has well and truly decided her daughter isn't worthy of her time at all or her perfect little family.", "What OP said was her daughter started to call her by name, which means calling someone by their given name.  Like Sarah.  Not the same as being called names.", "And I'm sure the boys deserve a Christmas without the daughter dynamic being the focal point. Plenty of other opportunities for the daughter to get to know her brothers; it doesn't have to be on their Christmas.", "I mean, after a year+ of speaking to her on the phone on a weekly basis I would hope by now that she knows a few things about her daughter..", "You don\u2019t think she would have figured that out during their weekly conversations?", "Money train ended?\n\nStep mom has real baby and doesnt want her anymore?", "Seems like too many people think Hallmark movies are documentaries", "Exactly, neither of them are to blame for the pain, it was the manipulation that hurt both of them, so they should both be able to acknowledge that and help each other heal rather than treating her daughter as if it is her fault.", "I mean, there\u2019s a really good chance her daughter will try to make the time all about some seriously deep stuff, and that\u2019s just not appropriate. The little kids deserve a Christmas.\n\n*That\u2019s not selfish for a mother to consider.", "I wish i had an award to gift you.", "This wasn't daughter's first contact out of the blue.  She has been speaking to that same daughter weekly for a year or more.  The interaction at 16 is no longer her last interaction.  If that behavior was being repeated, I think she would have pointed that out.\n\nBut that's still not my point.    She can express concern for her kids without accusing her daughter of being untrustworthy.", "OP also has trauma she needs time as well OPs daughter is angry because she heard no what is her rush.", "But has still grown up normalizing his toxic behavior so it\u2019s completely warranted that OP assessed that this now grown child isn\u2019t going to bring that toxic shit show to her younger kids. \n\nJust because OP gave birth to this woman doesn\u2019t mean she is required to open her life up to her again. Sucks but choices have consequences, even for 16yr.", "Right? Surprise! Here\u2019s your new older (adoptive) sister!\u2026 that you\u2019ve never met before\u2026\n\nI do wonder if the boys know she exists tho \ud83e\udd14", "She accepted responsibility and she only mentioned her father when OP didn\u2019t accept that. I think she is trying to say she was wrong and realized it just now due to her dad rather than avoiding responsibility. We disagree and that\u2019s fine, but I think OP might regret telling her daughter she\u2019s not sure if she even wants a relationship in the future.", "\u201cMom has a new life\u201d you don\u2019t outgrow your child. You\u2019re a shitty parent if that\u2019s the case. In which case at least some of what dad told the daughter was true. In which case mom has some apologizing to do as well", "Yeah visitation like that strikes me as a result of very good evidence on the husband\u2019s side or some devastating lack of evidence on the mother\u2019s side. Especially since, according to OP, her ex didn\u2019t have a lick of property or assets that he actually had in his own name or earned at any point in their marriage. If he was so destitute as to be judgement-proof (three jobs suggests she didn\u2019t get alimony) how did he get full custody of the kids?\n\nSpeculating on a divorce from two decades ago is difficult.", "Right daughter could\u2019ve picked a different day, not arguably one of the most significant holidays in North America. If she wanted to reconcile with family wouldn\u2019t it be more appropriate to slowly get acquainted? I cant even imagine being comfortable if I were in daughter\u2019s place, sure I like kids but they\u2019ve never met yet going to spend Christmas morning together? Heck no.", "Ahh yes because shame isn\u2019t something addicts have to deal with, and they\u2019re so famous for being truthful. \n\nAddicts only remain semi-functional as long as they keep it together; you only burn the bridge *after* you pawn the jewelry. We have zero evidence that daughter is a user of any kind, but we would also expect to have zero evidence if she was a user and good at it. If she\u2019s getting close to OP because she needs something from her, that\u2019s not like, going to be out in the open.", "I\u2019m adopted, and meeting my birth family was awful. There\u2019s a lot of big feelings coming from total strangers. \n\nWhy people want to pretend that family dynamics are somehow made easier by harder situations, I\u2019ll never understand", "\ud83d\ude02", ">rather than treating her daughter as if it is her fault.\n\nHow is that happening", ">rather than treating her daughter as if it is her fault.\n\nHow exactly? She met and talked with her daughter. All she's asking is for more time.", "Would you allow your loved ones to spend time with someone estranged to you? I wouldn't.\n\nIt's okay for people to express concern, and OP **is** saying that she doesn't trust her daughter because it is true and valid. It is the truth, does the daughter think that the mother will trust her instantly just because they're blood?\n\nThe daughter that should accept the fact that the mother she abandoned doesn't trust her yet.", "Stop acting like the 16 year old is full grown!", "She said in the comments they vaguely know of her existence but have never met her.", "The child outgrew Mom, right or wrong.\n\nMom moved on and the child is now an adult. After nearly 8-9 years of separation, low/no contact, and no parental relationship with Mom being explicitly replaced, there's nothing beyond Mom's grace that requires her to have a relationship with her daughter.", "Then stop acting like they're preschoolers."]}
