I love blankets, and he doesn't. One thing you can suggest to your husband, since he likes sheets. Get a smaller size sheet for his side of the bed.

You both agreed on a solution and it didn't work out. That isn't your fault. I don't know what he thinks getting another single bed will do for him if he doesn't have enough blanket at the moment. I'd suggest a solution to the issue like finding a way of holding the blankets in place, or getting a larger blanket to go over both of you. Alternatively, you could get separate beds for sleeping in as long as they are in a sensible place.

We make up half the bed with his covers and the other half with mine.", "Nta... he is a grown up, right? Like, he's managed to sleeping alone in a bed, before you two shared a bed? I'm a firm believer that two comforters=happy couple. My partner and I sleep very differently too, I like to be cool, use a fan, and a sheet.
