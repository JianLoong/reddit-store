You both agreed on a solution and it didn't work out. That isn't your fault. I don't know what he thinks getting another single bed will do for him if he doesn't have enough blanket at the moment. I'd suggest a solution to the issue like finding a way of holding the blankets in place, or getting a larger blanket to go over both of you.
