If your ex-wife's condition is going to be bad for a long time, or is possibly terminal, then obviously your kids need to spend as much time with her as possible in the duration you have. \n\nIf there was a prior discussion about how important this lunch was with your wife and stepdaughter, and you are now changing the plans last minute (day before is last minute), then that's a bit insensitive on your part and your communication game needs to step up. Why couldn't you have taken the boys to see their mother earlier in the morning, just for this one day? Or if there are grandparents involved who are able to take them, why not arrange that? \n\nIt's your job to create boundaries and schedules for your kids. If their request to do something comes at a bad time (and a birthday is once a year, there can be some flexibility here when it comes to honoring your sons' request) then it's up to you to figure out how to make it all work.

Having half of her family leave a few hours before the party starts doesn\u2019t really help either - especially when she was expecting to have lunch with you guys. \n\nThat said, like you said, the mother of their children is dying(?).

Take care of a sick kid vs go on a weekend vacay with the guys? Kid first. Kid A has a ball game and kid B has a surgery? Kid B is the priority. Wife\u2019s bday dinner is at X time on a Friday and your kids want to go to a movie? Wife is the priority. \n\nI\u2019ve basically been in your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shoes\u2014although I didn\u2019t have kids of my own\u2014where my (ex) husband would prioritize his kids or ex wife over me in situations where it wasn\u2019t very reasonable and was actually quite hurtful. Like\u2026having plans for months for my bday and then getting a call the night before \u201chey, mom wants to go on a date so I told her we\u2019d take the kids and I\u2019ll just invite my folks over and we will BBQ for your bday, okay? NO! Not okay! \n\nBut, I\u2019ve also helped the ex wife when she had a double mastectomy and let her stay with us so\nI could take care of her and the kids. \n\nSo all that said\u2026.I appreciate the situation you\u2019re in wanting to make things as easy on the kids and your ex as possible. That\u2019s awesomely good stuff. But you knew this bday lunch was a thing. Don\u2019t you think you could have taken the kids earlier in the day or skipped a day? Her daughter and she should matter too. Seems to me she\u2019s been pretty reasonable and gone along with the change of custody and the frequency of you being away. But she wants you to show up for her on one specific day for something important to her that happens once a year. \n\nSo I\u2019m going with ESH because her words and lashing out was not okay but I think you\u2019re being way too black and white on this \u201ckids first\u201d thing. \n\nJust my two cents as a step mom 44. My current partner has way better balance than my ex husband when it comes to his child and his ex.

This ruling seems very obvious.\n\nBut this post is interesting because it contrasts so neatly with another post I read and the reddit response was the exact opposite, which shows just how significant framing is to the audience. Some details are different and I know it\u2019s not exactly the same thing, but overall the morality of the situation is similar\u2026so I am going to share my thoughts for anyone curious.\n\nIn this other post we were hearing the side of the story from a healthy Ex-wife. Granted her scenario was a lot less amicable\u2026the OP was a burned single mother who was openly spiteful towards her former husband for cheating with his now wife and getting her pregnant. The poster and her ex husband have two small children, and he now has a daughter with this new wife. The OP states she wants nothing to do with this new child, and generally keeps their communication to the minimum necessary to co-parent THEIR children exclusively. Now her AITA post was relaying a scenario in which her ex-husband asked her for help to pickup his new daughter from school because she was sick. He would not normally ask, but he couldn\u2019t leave work as he was already at risk of losing his job because he had been leaving so often. This was due to the fact that his new wife has been diagnosed with cancer, and he was taking a lot of time off to support her through chemotherapy appointments. This poster knew all of this, but still when asked for help from her ex-husband she aggressively declined. Again, wanting nothing to do with this little girl who is sick at school. Her defense is he cheated on her, broke her heart etc. and couldn\u2019t possibly imagine that he should be asking her any favors. Reddit was in overwhelming agreement with the poster saying NTA, you reap what you sow etc. He shouldn\u2019t have cheated, got another woman pregnant etc. if he wasn\u2019t prepared to deal with the responsibility\u2026 \u201cThis little girl is NOT her family\u201d etc\u2026 Now i disagreed with the judgement. Everyone was talking about \u201cobligation\u201d. I.e. this healthy woman has no obligation to sympathise or help this other woman just because she is sick. Two people that have a partner in common are not OBLIGATED to care about the other\u2019s child\u2026. And yet, their children are step-siblings. Which was the crux of my argument. Jealousy and spitefulness are not justification for allowing a child to suffer, especially a child of a fatally sick parent. The question isn\u2019t \u201cam i obligated?\u201d\u2026the question is \u201cam i an AH?\u201d. And this post perfectly illustrates my point that no one seemed to get on the other post. A child that shares a parent with your own children IS a part of your life, and anyone who refuses to help a child in such a situation is an AH in my opinion. Making your ex\u2019s life harder out of spite, regardless of what they\u2019ve done, only makes things worse for everyone else\u2026 including your own children. I asked OP to consider what she would do if her children wanted to have a relationship with their step-sister as they age\u2026is she just going to screech about how their dad cheated on her every time they want to include this little girl in a family thing? Or does she plan to drive a wedge between the kids so deep that never even gets considered? \n\nIn this case OPs wife is putting her feelings above that of his sons with a fatally ill parent. In the other case the OP was also putting their feelings above that of a child with a fatally ill parent. And yet reddit has completely opposite reactions because of who is telling the story, and what the perceived obligation is. \n\nSo I\u2019d just like to say this, people that are co-parenting with ex\u2019s they DON\u2019T like\u2026 amicable or not all the same stuff applies when it comes to the actual children. You don\u2019t HAVE to be a step-parent to your ex\u2019s kid, but your kids do have to be step-siblings to your ex\u2019s kids\u2026and that should matter to you. Please for the sake of your kids try to forgive your ex to the point where you can extend love and grace to ALL the children involved\u2026 it makes life so much easier. Being cheated on is not the worst thing that can happen to a person, you can get past it and many people do.. cancer. Cancer is worse. Losing a parent to cancer is also worse. Swallow your pride and be the better person if ever faced with this situation\u2026 it says a lot about your character if you are willing to help someone in crisis that you don\u2019t particularly like. Or else be an AH and don\u2019t come to reddit to convince a bunch of strangers your actions (or lack thereof) are okay because the other person is mean or whatever.\n\nTL;DR IMO when someone gets really sick we should try to be as kind, helpful and accommodating to the children involved\u2026 regardless of our role/wants/needs in the situation. Or else be deemed an AH.", "NTA: One idea though is that you can take Anna\u2019s daughter for a lunch at a separate time/day as a treat.

Y\u2019all need to talk and REALLY listen to each other.", "How does asking one Friday is so bad here? Can't they visit any other day? If they are visiting on every weekend, can't they visit Saturday and Sunday? Is asking for one Friday so bad? I'm not getting your point!", "I\u2019m betting Anna tries to talk you out of taking the boys to Disney with you\u2026.", "Are you sure? How does she treat them when you\u2019re not around?? Do your boys seem happy with her or distant?", "You are a great dad. I wish my mom would\u2019ve done the same for me when my dad was dying from cancer. And they were together! I wasn\u2019t even allowed to go to the funeral. I\u2019ve never forgiven her for that. Trust me. You don\u2019t want your kids to grow up with that trauma. Losing a parent at such a young age is trauma enough.\n\nETA: I was six when he died.", "Please, please, please don\u2019t listen to this point of view. It\u2019s so wrong.", "Nope\u2026\u2026she will treat your boys horribly if their mother passes. And if Sarah leaves them any money, she\u2019ll try to take it. She\u2019ll also talk basket about their mother.", "Agreed.  The engagement needs to be put on pause and serious conversations need to happen with your fianc\u00e9 to have her prove she won\u2019t mistreat your boys.", "\u201cThey have grandparents right?  Maybe you should let them take care of your kids, my daughter needs you more, don\u2019t you love her?\u201d", "Absolutely  agree. This thought breaks my mother's  heart.", "Always gotta believe people when they show ya in situations like this. Actions don't lie", "Survival rate of 1 year is just under 20%. 5 year survival rate is below 4%.", "This is your own hangups clouding your judgement. Please take a step back and evaluate with a neutral perspective . This is the last thing he should be worrying about . Walking on eggshells and rehearsing his communications to not upset his clearly immature and insecure spouse rather than them being natural is the last thing he should be doing when his KIDS are about to possibly lose their MOM . YOU had a bad experience with an ex and it's making you concentrate on this woman's feelings as YOU feel a connection to her. She is categorically in the wrong for placing HER needs/emotions above 2young kids that probably already know that their mom won't be around much longer . OP is 100 percent NTA but his fiance is the AH and you kinda seem like one aswell . Ever thought your insecurity made your partner leave ? He didn't blackmail you lmao he essentially asked you top stop talking about it. I hope you get over your heartbreak I really do but this is totally irrelevant. If you bring a LIFE into the world with someone you will ALWAYS have feelings/connection to them regardless of what happens and they are clearly on excellent terms and they have brought 2 lives into this world together . Edit. In short her emotions/opinions are totally irrelevant.", "So you\u2019re suggesting she brought up the love he has for his possibly dying co-parent as a way of getting reassurance of his love for herself? And you think it\u2019s Anna who deserves better? Yikes.", "Yes they do. And most hospitals don't allow more than two visitors so...", "Exactly! Their mother is dying, they only get so much time to see her, the lunch is less important than getting to see their mother", "Because she\u2019s dying, her chemo is failing and OP said there\u2019s a big chance she won\u2019t make it. The boys seeing their dying mother when they can is more important than OP going to lunch for a 4yr old.\n\nAnd OP is taking her to Disney and to a taco lunch on another day", "> Step is a good man!\n\nHe sounds like the kind of person that anyone would be fortunate to have in their life.", "Ok now I\u2019m outright crying.\n\nI come from really mean people on both sides. I made a rule 20 years ago that no one could shit talk another member of my family to me or I would go NC. Sadly, I\u2019ve had to enforce it bc no one wanted to give up the family sport. What\u2019s crazy is new siblings have appeared thanks to 23 and me and they BOTH do it too! And they married people who join in.  It\u2019s so sad. \n\nI got my answer to \u201cwould you rather be right or alone?\u201d It was a sad Christmas but I\u2019ll take it over listening to anyone speak ill of someone else.", "Same!  It's a kind and well-adjusted response from one mother to another.  For the love of the man and the children he made, what can I do to ease any fear and suffering?  \n\nYou want love for you and your child, you give love to his children and anyone involved in the creation.  Now is not the time to have the Insecurity Beast rear its ugly head.  To make things harder is so selfish.", "This should have way more upvotes. OP if she won't do that as your fiancee, how do you think she will be after the wedding if Sarah dies and you have full custody?", "That\u2019s what I would do too. How can I help her? How can I help you? Whoever is important to you is important to me.", "Even if she remembered, her stepbrothers going to see their very sick mother is understandable even to a small child. I wonder why the fianc\u00e9e lacks even this basic amount of empathy.", "Or if anything wedding related falls on the anniversary of the death.", "This is beautiful. I'm so sorry you and your boys are having to go through this. Hoping for the best for all...", "The wisest words I have seen on reddit, and a most graceful response from a thoughtful man", "This is totally understandable. I actually know of lots of people who are much better as friends than lovers.", "I have to agree. I was 14 and my brother 7 when his dad(my stepdad) died. There are pictures of his dad up around but he didn\u2019t grow up hearing stories about his dad and his family dipped once the funeral was over. It breaks my heart to think that my brother doesn\u2019t remember his father and doesn\u2019t have stories of him. The sad part is that my mom and stepdad were married until he died. Yesterday was the 21 year anniversary and while the grief gets easier to carry it never goes away. It also doesn\u2019t get smaller, you just grow around it. Please pay close attention to your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s behavior and reconsider your relationship if she is not in full support of doing anything and everything possible to make things as easy for you and the boys and helps aid in their remembering of their mom.", "This may not be what she imagined, but it is what one bargains for in choosing to share a life together. You choose to support your partner and build them up, not add more bullshit stress when they are in traumatic situations. And those traumatic situations almost always happen in life. Parents die. Siblings die. People get extremely sick or get in car wrecks. When getting married you sign up for those situations. It is literally right there in the vows. If Anna cannot handle that then she is not ready to get married. \n\nI am very sorry for the sorrow and pain that you and your boys are living with now.", "I'm sorry that you, your children, and your ex-wife are going through this very hard time.   \n\nI'm also sorry that it seems Internet strangers have more compassion for you, your children, and your ex-wife than you fiancee does.  \n\nIt's okay that Anna feels like this is a hard time for her too because this is a hard time for you. It's not okay that she is making it about herself. She is not the victim. She is not dying a painful, suffering death. Her mother is not dying. The parent of her children is not dying. Making herself the victim in this situation is heinous and disgusting. \n\nI'm sorry to make you think bad thoughts, but what if you get sick in the future? How will she behave in that situation? God forbid, what if one of your sons gets sick? Would she forbid you from seeing your son in the hospital because she is jealous of that attention? Do you believe you can count on her? Do you believe she loves your children?", "Oh my god. I\u2019m so sorry.", "Minors generally need to be accompanied by adults. He's not really a visitor.", "All we know is that the current treatment isn't working \"as well as they hoped\".\n\nThat is miles away from saying it's terminal.", "Honestly this feels like a \u201cthe accusation is a confession\u201d situation. Anna sees love as finite, and is lashing out at there being less for her daughter (and by extension, herself). In the same regard, she most likely intends to only offer OPs kids the minimum of care so that she can keep the remainder for her daughter (and by extension, herself). \n\nThis may be a harsh assumption, but if you\u2019re jealous of people receiving help/attention when they\u2019re in their greatest need, it\u2019s fair to assume you\u2019ll be even worse when they\u2019re not.", "They're currently discussing putting her into experimental treatments, that's not something you do when your prognosis is positive.", "Perhaps not, but he did what a good dad does-put his family before himself. Glad you have such great people in your life."]}
