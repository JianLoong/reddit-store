Why couldn't you have taken the boys to see their mother earlier in the morning, just for this one day? Or if there are grandparents involved who are able to take them, why not arrange that? \n\nIt's your job to create boundaries and schedules for your kids.

Take care of a sick kid vs go on a weekend vacay with the guys? Kid first. Kid A has a ball game and kid B has a surgery? Kid B is the priority. Wife\u2019s bday dinner is at X time on a Friday and your kids want to go to a movie? Wife is the priority. \n\nI\u2019ve basically been in your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s shoes\u2014although I didn\u2019t have kids of my own\u2014where my (ex) husband would prioritize his kids or ex wife over me in situations where it wasn\u2019t very reasonable and was actually quite hurtful. Like\u2026having plans for months for my bday and then getting a call the night before \u201chey, mom wants to go on a date so I told her we\u2019d take the kids and I\u2019ll just invite my folks over and we will BBQ for your bday, okay? NO!

Her daughter and she should matter too. Seems to me she\u2019s been pretty reasonable and gone along with the change of custody and the frequency of you being away. But she wants you to show up for her on one specific day for something important to her that happens once a year. \n\nSo I\u2019m going with ESH because her words and lashing out was not okay but I think you\u2019re being way too black and white on this \u201ckids first\u201d thing. \n\nJust my two cents as a step mom 44. My current partner has way better balance than my ex husband when it comes to his child and his ex.

If Anna actually thinks that the above is not a sufficient and thoughtful celebration of a 4 year old birthday with your family unit she needs several reality checks. \n\nI'm a SM as is my DH to my child and if I was in your circumstances I would be so disgusted with him.\n\nI would strongly recommend you do get married in the near future. While your ex wife treatment continues your children's ability to spend time with her is an absolute priority. It can never be got back once it is gone.\n\nIf your ex wife's treatment doesn't work and your children sadly lose their mother you will all need the space to grieve what you have all lost. That includes you. You will be facing raising them as their own biological parent and helping them navigate a life with out her.\n\nYour ex wife is potentially dying. Your fiance is the one who is healthy, well and building a future with you and your combined children. Yes this situation is tough. I ve been through something similar, it was very difficult but ultimately I respect my DH more for the compassion and support he showed his ex and family. \n\nAnna clearly is having difficulties and maybe she needs to get some support to help her work through them. But that support should not include you reducing any times your children want to visit with their mother.", "Then I'm gonna go with a NAH, but there's room for improvement. You both should have communicated expectations better beforehand. Were you both on the same page on whether the breakfast tradition was supposed to replace the lunch tradition or be added on top of it? It doesn't sound like it, and that could have been clarified first. I totally get why you want to let the kids spend as much time as possible with their mom, but I also see why it would be frustrating for Anna that you missed lunch with your step-daughter on her birthday. I do think what she said to you was an overreaction, though.", "OP has said numerous times in the comments that he was there for birthday breakfast and came back home in time for the party. Her bio dad was there for lunch. I dont understand what more people want from this poor guy. His kids mother could die any day. Skipping the hospital visit for one day because of a birthday is a bigger deal than everyone is making it out to be.", "That would have been a fair compromise if it was agreed upon, by all parties, beforehand. I do get AH vibes from the fianc\u00e9, but asking for one day to be dedicated to the birthday kid isn\u2019t necessarily unfathomable.", "From my understanding OP, the fianc\u00e9 and the birthday girl had breakfast alone. Lunch would have been with the boys included, since it seems like they would have been available around lunch too. It seems like the lunch is for everyone in the family, and more intimate that the party.", "Perhaps she should see this in a \u2026 macro-perspective? What has to be done right now, has to be done, but this will not last forever, right? It is so hard to keep things on an even keel, when emotions escalate. I think that apart from feeling neglected, she may also feel threatened? That you will simply\u2026 leave? Some comments mentioned couple\u2019s therapy, but I think that that is an option when you run out of solutions. From the way I see it, the two of you still have space to make this work on your own.", "Didnt know she might die sorry I just thought a short trip to hospitor \n\nEnglish is not my first language", "It\u2019s one day out of many days they can be told we will go at this time unless there are hospital constraints.", "Well it is at a specific time but your ex wife isn\u2019t exactly busy so you can likely visit her a different time.\n\nYour boys and their mother are important and are going through a hard time right now but that doesn\u2019t mean their soon to be sister isn\u2019t important. \n\nMissing something that can\u2019t be rescheduled for something that can be might be what is upsetting your fianc\u00e9.\n\nBy all means take the boys to visit their mother as often as possible but maybe just not during a once a year birthday lunch?", "That's a new edit and that info wasn't there when I wrote my judgement.", "This.

You need to have a sit down with your fiance dude.  Post tacos, of course.\n\nNTA OP.  Not even close.", "My guess is that the boys will be in school during Tacos and Sarah won't be since it is a Monday. I also assume the party was on a weekend day.", "Fair enough, that does make sense", "And how is she going to react if their mother passes and you're in mourning.

The fianc\u00e9e trying to guilt trip him is despicable as well.", "I'm sorry you feel that spending time with a girl who is at that moment spending time with *her real dad* and other family and she is in no way being emotionally neglected (after you've already spent the morning and agreed to spend the evening with her), takes priority over bringing your young children to visit their *dying mother* in hospital for *a couple of hours* because they asked because they're scared and confused and their whole world could fall apart any day now.\n\nI really hope half of you here never have to make the choice between the potential last days of a loved one's life and **lunch**.", "Yeah and those boys would rather spend that time with there mother who\u2019s dying, not there dads future wife and her kid", "How is her step daughter who is 4 and not even his stepdaughter, his Gf's daughter's bday lunch more important that his own kids getting some time with their DYING MOTHER?!?!", "A few hours earlier he had a birthday breakfast with her.\n\nA few hours later he was at her birthday party.", "No it doesn\u2019t. \nI\u2019m sorry but I\u2019m this situation HIS children seeing there dying mother comes before his future step daughters birthday lunch", "He is not her dad, her mom is not his wife. His kids must come first.", "My ex and I said that we wouldn't *make* the kids go to the hospital. It's a lot for them to handle and they are still small kids, so we wouldn't just force it upon them or something. \n\nWe try to do as many hospital visits as possible in the hospital cafeteria or take a small walk in the park out front, so that they don't sit in a hospital room. But most days she can't really get up, so they like to snuggle in bed with her because that's what they always want when they're sick. They want to be there with her, and it breaks me to watch them cry when we leave the hospital, so yeah, they come absolutely first right now.", "And with mom could be the last days, how important can a lunch be that will be there for the next year's when there mother is dying?", "You can always edit it instead of being stubborn.", "What's the term?", "I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in such a tricky situation.

A break isn\u2019t the end of the world, and perhaps it will help Anna develop some empathy. I understand it\u2019s tough to watch your partner dedicate so much time and affection to someone who had his heart at one time, but a truly empathetic person would understand that the boys need their mom more than ever and would be supporting you in keeping the boys\u2019 foundation as stable as possible. Since her response to you was so selfish, I don\u2019t think she has the wherewithal to do the kind of self introspection necessary to be the partner you need, so a break may be a really good idea. It\u2019ll either shock her into doing that introspective work, or it\u2019ll confirm that you two aren\u2019t compatible. Either way, kudos to you for being the dad the boys need.

Framing it as a \u201cyour kid vs my kids\u201d isn\u2019t kind to anyone involved.

If you always put your children first during this time, you relationship wont survive. Balance is key. My dad sometimes brought me to my aunt even when i wanted to join him to visit cause they needed alone time. It is fine. You cant always get what you want. I can also imagine a party wont be much fun after visiting you mother in the hospital, especially since they are very emotional afterwards. Lastly. Communicating the day before sucks.
