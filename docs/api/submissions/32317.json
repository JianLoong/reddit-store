{"id": 32317, "submission_id": "18aezjv", "title": "AITA for not wanting my husband to keep sending money to his wealthy parents?", "selftext": "My (29F) husband's (30M) parents are wealthy, and he tries to take whatever chance he can to pay them back for the privileged upbringing they've afforded him. We're talking thousands per year - he tries to pay for their bills, send them $1,000 for every birthday/holiday/etc. They try to refuse because they do not need or even want the money. When we're talking wealthy, we're talking they don't bat an eye at spending hundreds of thousands casually on a new vacation home every few years. So the extra money means nothing to them, but my husband absolutely insists on sending them the money and refuses to let them send it back in hopes that he can eventually pay them back. His privileged upbringing is an insecurity of his since often in modern society, it's seen negatively to have grown up wealthy and being able to take the \"easy street\" in life. He wants to say that his successes are self-made.\n\n\r  \nI bring this up to him each time, but he counters saying that I am selfish and ungrateful for all that they have done for us. It's not giving them our money. It's giving back some of the money that they've given to us, he said. I usually let it go at the end of each of each argument. I snapped the other day when he offered to pay their $3,000 credit card bill and confronted him after we got home, saying that he needs to consult with me before gifting his parents such large sums of money. I asked him why he feels the need to be giving money from us, a middle class working couple, to his parents who are in the top 1%. He got defensive and said that anyone and everyone would want to give back to their parents if they could, and because we have the means to, we should. When I point out that it's HIM they've given money to in the form of paying for his tuition, his car, his food/clothing, etc., he then countered that I can think of it as him alone giving HIS money back to them, even though legally, it's OUR marital assets he's pulling from. He said that it was to my benefit that they paid for his education and a lot of things for him, because when we entered the marriage, he had more assets to bring, while I had less assets since I had to work through my student debt first. So he said it's ungrateful for me to think that the money they've invested into him only benefited him.\n\n\r  \nI don't think this is benefiting any parties involved. $5,000-$10,000 per year means a lot to us financially and is a sizable chunk of our annual income, but to his parents, this is couch change. They insist they don't even want his money and seem uncomfortable with him forcing it on them each time. I feel like he's only doing this to address his insecurity, but he insists it's not. I keep telling him that his parents want him to pay them back in the form of spending time with them, not in the form of money, but he's stubborn. AITA here? Maybe I don't understand because I am alienated from my parents and thus don't understand how the normal parent/child dynamic should work?\r  \n", "created_utc": 1701674401, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18aezjv/aita_for_not_wanting_my_husband_to_keep_sending/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The fact that they are rich and wealthy is just coincidence. Yes, he got lucky with that. But he really does not owe them payback.\n\nOn the other hand, it's a good sign, he is concsious about this. But instead of paying his parents money they neither want or need, it would be better, if he would start to spend money to people and organizations that need it, like shelters for the homeless, salvation army or such.", "NAH It\u2019s great and selfless of him for wanting to pay that back, but it\u2019s not necessary. Could you maybe talk to his parents about asking him to pay that back another way? For example you mentioned quality time. Coming from you, it will always appear selfish to him, but if it came from his parents it might be different.", "NAH\n\nWhere you are coming from makes perfect sense, like 100%.

And even if he has paid it over, he is such a great man for being so responsible to his parents. And if anything you should be respecting him for being like that, such a rare quality in today's generation\n\nHe deserves better. \n\nok, read till the end. yeah no wonder you dont understand and acting so entitled. spoken like an alienated child. problem children sigh. your husband is really too ncie to take u under his wing.", "Maybe suggest to his parents to accept the money and invest it for you under your husband\u2019s name.", "Find the root cause why he is doing this. \n\nObviously it\u2019s not because they need money.

You could talk to his parents alone and explain how his giving the money away affects you and if they could tell him to stop. This is a slippery slope as your husband could be very pissed if you approach his parents.\n\nBut another idea would be to talk to your husband and suggest to use that money for a scholarship for a kid to better their future? This wouldn't be paying back money back to someone who is already ultra rich but he would pay it forward to someone who could need some extra money to visit college or a trade school.", "NTA That's a really weird dynamic and the fact that he is insisting on it even though his parents don't want it suggests that the issue here is about his insecurities and feelings about his upbringing, and he might benefit from talking to a therapist.\n\nYou and he might also benefit from seeing a counsellor or therapist together, because there is a bigger issue here abut him using a fairly significant proportion of your joint incomes without you getting a say .\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMaybe you can have a further conversation where you acknowledge that it is importnat to him, but suggest that you would like to explore ways in which he can feel that he is giving back to his parents but that you can also talk about how you manage your joint finances.  Have his parents ever said that they would like to spend more time with him/you? \n\nBetween you and him, perhaps you could look at reorganising your finances so that you both have some individual discretionary spending money - that way, he can chose to use some of his personal spending money to give money to his parents, without digging into the joint savings. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI don't think it is normal to want to give ack to your parents what they spent raising you - you didn't get a say in their decision to have children, there is no debt .  And wanting to respect them would normally include taking their wishes and feelings into account, and perhaps being ready to offer more support as they age and need it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou are not going to win an argument over this with him, becasue his position is not rational, it is an emotional one, but if you are able to talk to him in a situation where he doesn't feel defensive, you may be able t o work with him to understand how and why he feels, and then to explore options you can both feel comfortable with.", "What?

If none of these questions are being answered, then giving away money is neither right or wrong. It's simply irresponsible.", "NTA. I would be mad.\n\nMy suggestions here is to do 2 things:\n\n1) Tell his parents that you guys don't really have the money and that your husband is giving all your extra money to them due to some sort of insecurity. Tell your husband you will be telling his parents this, also.\n\n2) Set up a house hold budget that includes 3 bank accounts. Yours, His, and a shared account that pays all the bills. Agree on what goes into the shared account. Then the rest is his money. Make sure that he only gives to his parents anything that is in his personal account / savings.  Inform him that any extra given you will be telling his parents he stole it from you and asking for it back.  If he has anxiety now, the thought of his parents being told he stole money to give them and you asking for it back should be a good deterrent.", "Another day where we see a post from someone who got married with out taking through financial goals. \n\n\nNTA but you two are not aligned financially and this will most likely not be the last scenario where you aren\u2019t aligned financially.", "NAH. Not fair to call the husband an AH cause he wants to take care of his parents (even if it\u2019s not necessary).", "Your boy needs therapy.", "All I can say, is that it is Chinese customs and culture to repay your parents for all they\u2019ve done. No matter how rich they are, it is customary.  As children, Chinese people were taught to honor, respect, and look after their parents through out all stages of life, unless the parents did them wrong.  \n\nYour husband have a great relationship with his parents from the looks of this post and is trying to repay them back because he knows he is privileged. Being Chinese Americans mean they were also immigrantes from China and moved to America for a better standard of living and future for their son. That means at some point his family have to sacrifice a lot of things to get where they are now, wealthy and privileged. Do you understand that OP? Wealth isn\u2019t built overnight and takes time, effort, dedication, sacrifice. \n\nHis parents not accepting his efforts is them knowing and understanding where your husband is coming from and his intentions. \n\nAlso as a Chinese couple, the spouses take care of each others family together. Ask him if he would do the same for your family if you guys are in speaking/good terms? If he says yes, OP you have a great husband. If he says no, tell him to use his own money and not the money from your joint account.", "He needs to go to therapy and work on his issues and insecurities regarding his parents money.", "Yes, hello OP, I am your husband's parents please send all this money to me directly.", "NTA\u2026how does husband know how much is on their credit cards?!", "People have kids and pay for the lifestyle and needs of their kids. They do not desire nor want to be paid back for this. Appreciated, respected, modeled after, yes, but not reciprocated. Tell him he needs to just feel fortunate and not feel guilty about being brought up wealthy. What is it with everyone wanting to be guilty? Be rich! It\u2019s totally fine! There will always be others with less and often it\u2019s not something you can help. Many people just won\u2019t or can\u2019t make long term actions or plans. Those that do often end up better off. It\u2019s a fact of life.", "NTA", "There is absolutely nothing normal here. Separate your finances and insist that he pay bills first and keeps his insecure little boy hands off of your money. I would suggest you try therapy, which he obviously needs but I\u2019m guessing he wouldn\u2019t go. You need to ask yourself if this is how you want to spend your life.", "Info: how does he know their credit card bill? To me that seems like they have some sort of agreement", "NTA\n\nTell your husband that therapy is cheaper", "NTA but I recommend getting your own account to have your paychecks deposited into. And then use your joint account just to put in a little bit towards your portion of the bills.  then perhaps he will get the message especially if he has to come to you to ask you for money to give to his parents", "His parents are extremely open about their finances to us which is why I know their net worth and asset amounts. Regarding the credit card, his parents asked us to collect their mail while they are out of town and tell them how much they need to pay for their bills since they are old school and don\u2019t do things online.", "They asked us to collect their mail while they are out of town and call to tell them how much they need to pay for their bills.

NTA", "Than NTA, very odd behavior.  I've heard of taking care of your parents when they get old, but not repaying them for raising you", "1.5 generation Chinese American here\u2026this is weird to me. Parents paying for kids\u2019 education is basic form of act of love. And IF he is all about filial piety, then he violated the biggest one there is. That could explain it.  Before anyone start yelling at me, I am not saying OP and husband needs to have kids to appease the older generation, I am just saying this could be explain the behavior. It would be viewed in certain circles that he is extremely unfilial if he is an only child of an only child (Paternal side). \n\nBut he needs to realize that love of a parent is unconditional. Yes, his parents can\u2019t brag about him like he is auntie so and so\u2019s kid, house, married, kids\u2026but you know what, they should be proud of himself for standing in his own two feet and not draining parents\u2019 bank account.  I would normally suggest a talk with the parents, but if they are focused on the grandkids thing\u2026it would not be a good idea for now.", "They had big corporate executive incomes, and their financial manager consistently invested it over their careers."]}
