You mention that the parking lot you PAY for doesn\u2019t allow certain vehicles.  Well, this marina doesn\u2019t allow what he did, whether that be asking the questions or yelling to the staff, it is irrelevant, as it\u2019s private.  \n\nI also doubt your claim that people ask you how much you paid for your 2010 ford sedan.", "Right?? It\u2019s weird and concerning!", "You\u2019re talking about between you and friends. This is some random stranger yelling at either staff or the owner who doesn\u2019t know this random person. If that\u2019s okay between you and your friends, that\u2019s fine, but from some random person yelling at you from another boat? It\u2019s tacky and rude."]}
