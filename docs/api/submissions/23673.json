Mark just turned 52 a couple of months ago. We recently just started becoming close over the past year. It started off as an innocent friendship but has increasingly gotten worse the more time has passed. Months ago I had noticed his behavior around me was different than how he treated our other co workers. I later confronted him about it and asked if he had feelings for me, at first he had denied it but soon admitted that he had and it just wasn\u2019t something he wanted to admit because of our vast age difference. \n\nNow, I want to clarify that I do not have romantic feelings for him but because of how close we have grown to each other I do feel a strong emotional connection to him. I am ashamed to admit that we have engaged in some sexual activity \u2014 usually initiated by him. Although when I am heavily drinking I have never stopped it but the morning after I felt disgusted with myself. He would try to kiss me sober and I would always push myself away because again, it was wrong to me. I would like to clarify we have never had sex although he has been trying. \n\nI feel like this is my fault because his feelings for me make me extremely uncomfortable so I will tend to push myself away but miss our conversations and start talking again and the cycle just repeats itself. When we do talk, it is nothing short of toxic. He is very controlling regarding my friendships with guys, he has called me several hurtful names (i.e. slut, cunt, bitch). I feel like it\u2019s worth saying I have only slept with two men and both of those men I was in long term relationships with so I feel like it is unwarranted to call me such names. He always apologizes and begs for forgiveness and I am always dumb enough to talk to him again. \n\nHe always tells me that we are going to be married and gets offended and aggressive when I shut him down and tell him how wrong it is.  I know I need to cut ties all together because this whole situation is just entirely fucked up and I wish I would\u2019ve never asked if he had feelings for me. If we didn\u2019t work together this would be way less harder, but we do. Am I the asshole for telling him we will never be married?

The only way to deal with him is to totally ghost. No interaction. If he is a supervisor and persists threaten to report him. Getting aggressive when you don\u2019t get your way is for 4 year olds. He is literally threatening you with violence so he gets what he wants. Leave leave leave.", "You need to learn what boundaries are and how to build them and enforce them. I highly recommend counseling and not drinking in his presence\u2026perhaps not drinking at all until you can feel safe and confident in your ability to stick up for yourself. Find healthy companionship elsewhere because this isn\u2019t it! \n\nGentle Y T A here, because you can do better for yourself than this old dude! I\u2019ve been in plenty of toxic relationships and the best things I ever did for myself are (in this order!) broke up with and cut contact with the guy, got a puppy, made great girl friends who REALLY looked out for each other, went to counseling and learned a ton about myself. \n\nAs far as the basic judgement, I say NTA\u2026this guy is a super predator and seems to take advantage of your weakest moments- drunk/drinking, lonely, etc. Any way you can transfer to a different department or something to get away from him? Better yet, a different branch or location and change your number? Break it off completely and when he starts harassing you, file a police report and get a restraining order- even a temporary one. Hopefully he\u2019ll get the hint.", "It seems like you need to talk to somebody a bit about self respect and boundaries. I\u2019ve been there.

Something with your father? I don\u2019t understand why you feel such a strong emotional connection when it\u2019s clear that you don\u2019t even like this dude (he sounds gross as a person!!). Sexually or otherwise. I hope you understand that I am not judging you, because I really have been there. I hope you can completely cut that off and put it behind you moving forward.", "Kind of NTA. But,  ffs, so drinking,  lol for a new job and cut all contact with this creep.

You're getting yourself in an abusive relationship, it has already started. And do not go drinking with him, you are not safe!", "This guy sounds like he could become a stalker.  I think that you should call a women's domestic violence hotline, and get professional advice from them.\n\nMy guess is that they might recommend a new job in a new location for starters, but that there are likely legal considerations here that you need to do to protect yourself.", "NTA. You were 18 when you started working with this man when he was 48. That\u2019s a HUGE age difference, and it\u2019s honestly inappropriate for a man 30 years your senior to strike up a friendship with you when you were a teenager. When you realized he had a romantic interest in you, you told him how you felt and declined his advances. Any responsible man would realize that you\u2019re not truly into him if you reject him when you\u2019re sober but will hook up with him when you\u2019re intoxicated. There\u2019s a very good possibility that he has seen this pattern and is taking advantage of you by continuing to make advances towards you when he knows you\u2019re drunk. Then you said he\u2019s controlling towards other friendships you have and verbally abuses you? \n\nThis sounds like a man who has groomed you into becoming part of a relationship you never wanted to be in, and now you\u2019re trapped. You need to put a very clear stop to all contact with him outside of work\u2014tell him specifically you no longer welcome his friendship and he is not to contact you further\u2014and you need to keep all contact with him at work as sparse as possible and as professional as possible. I\u2019d also suggest that you take care to never drink in this man\u2019s presence again, and I\u2019d honestly suggest reporting him to HR. He used his job to groom a barely legal coworker into a sexual relationship she never wanted to be in, and there\u2019s a chance for retaliation at work if he\u2019s verbally abused you in private. \n\nPlease be safe, OP!", "NTA. From my perspective, you\u2019ve been sexually assaulted on more than one occasion, and he\u2019s actively sexually harassing you. If I were your friend, then I would tell you this man is not, and you might consider reporting him to HR. Not sure if pressing charges is going to do any good, but if he has to get you drunk to get you to engage with him in a sexual capacity, that\u2019s not consensual behavior.", "Stop this. Stop having any sort of relationship with this man and use your backbone to realise that missing company doesn\u2019t mean dealing with toxic people because you don\u2019t want to be alone.

Trust me on this one.", "WTF did I just read", "Everything about they way this man treats you is throwing up red flags for an abusive relationship. He's trying to control who you see or speak to, he's talking about you getting married and gets \"offended\" when you say that's not going to happen. He pursues you when he knows you do not want him to. That's not even addressing the 30 year age gap of a man in his 50s pursuing someone who is barely an adult and who could very easily be his own child. You need to get away from this person. I don't the environment you work in. I don't know if Mark is your superior or has any control over you at work. However, I think you may be beyond HR. You should report to them, but I wouldn't expect that to fix the problem. I honestly think you need to consider getting a new job; one where you are not exposed to Mark. It's not fair to you at all, but you are honestly not safe around this man.", "Your NTA but also not making great choices. Although with your age your entitled to make some mistakes and he should be able to read the signs. Hooking up while your drunk though is the worst thing you can do, again though he absolutely knows what he's doing in that situation.  You're absolutely right you probably need to cut all ties and if that means you have to get a different job, it'd be worth it. Now if your job is a great career opportunity then Idk, I know what I would do but I'm not a female. But, what I'd do is be very mean about it, that's the easiest explanation. Like it's not even mean really, it's just being very blunt very straight forward. Have a male family member with you to help punctuate the seriousness of it. If this guy has not lost his mind then he should get it then, if he has lost it, then law enforcement is the correct path. Not the path I would go, but the only path I feel comfortable advising.", "You\u2019re not theAH, he\u2019s delusional.

He never exercised was an addict and overweight after about his 3rd relationship with some 20 year old girl while he was pushing 50 at 28 I was like yea women are gross and men are too to this day he still dates Taco Bell girls and I wonder wtf does that grease ball continue to say to young women in his employment and it\u2019s like well shit they want that attention too", "ESH. Stop hanging out with him.", "Guys a total loser.  Move on", "NTA and if your tipsy/drunk when he pushes himself on you THAT IS NOT CONSENT", "You need to stay away from him. Name calling is abuse. Trying to initiate sex with you when you're drunk, knowing that sober you say no is abuse. The fact that he's aggressive WILL escalate into physical abuse if it hasn't already. He apologizes, but virtually all abusers do this, and then it starts all over again. Can you be reassigned to a different area at work, or can you turn it into an HR complaint that his advances are unwelcome and making you uncomfortable?

He is gross and you deserve better", "NTA. At least you're being honest with him about that. You need to cut contact and just not deal with him anymore. If you can switch departments if you are in the same Department with him or have to work with him on projects you need to somehow not interact with him at work anymore. Also you might want to start looking for another job cuz it's probably going to get ugly there. If it does go to HR. But if he's a valued employee they might dump you before they dump him. Stop going out drinking with him and doing anything sexual with him that has got to come to an end. He probably thinks you're leaving him on at this point. You've been very upfront with him but your actions say something different to them so stop doing anything with him. If he wants to do something tell me you're busy if he starts harassing you about it just tell him I said I was busy I don't need to tell you what I'm doing it's none of your business leave me alone.

I had to end the friendship. You should end yours. \n\nYou have let this go too far for too long. There is no \"just friends\" at this point. Block his personal number and email.

My boss is also aware of the situation as well. I am scared to tell my family the extent of it all.", "I don\u2019t have a problem being alone. I\u2019d rather be alone. The reason why I am struggling to distance myself from him is because we bonded over familial trauma and other personal stuff.", "He is literally targeting her when she\u2019s been drinking on purpose! She\u2019s unable to consent because she\u2019s intoxicated- she even said she doesn\u2019t say yes but she doesn\u2019t stop him either because she\u2019s been drinking- that\u2019s not consent! He\u2019s assaulting her, he\u2019s a grown-ass man who knows better but he\u2019s still being a predator. Stop blaming the victim, he know what he\u2019s doing and he\u2019s a fucking creep.", "She\u2019s only had sex with him when she was extremely drunk :( She didn\u2019t consent.", "No he\u2019s not, she\u2019s a 22 year old adult who gets drunk with him and engages in sexual behavior and enjoys their \u201cemotional connection\u201d. Yeah he might be a creep, but he\u2019s not committing any crime or really doing anything wrong. She can stop meeting him out and getting drunk with him.", "Hahahaha this actually made me laugh thank you", "I started dating my first boyfriend towards the end of my sophomore year I believe and we broke up shortly after graduating. After that I became friends with benefits with one of my close guy friends. We have been doing our thing for almost 3 years.", "I didn\u2019t get sexual with him, HE pursued me and I would try to push away and he was always very insistent no matter how much I had initially resisted. Yeah, I was drinking, but he also didn\u2019t have the self control to stop it either. And no I DONT like the attention. There is a reason I came on here to ask advice because I am simply worried and uncomfortable. No I shouldn\u2019t have gone to his house at all. Me and him just had a lot of common in relation to losing people that were a very big part of our lives, familial trauma\u2026etc. I am sorry that you hate women so much.", "Sorry", "He has actually worked with this company for 17 years, so yes he is \u201cvalued\u201d in that sense but does not hold a handle to my position. I am the only one that knows how to perform my job efficiently and losing me would be bad for the company. Also, my boss IS aware of the situation and said he would have no problem walking him out if needed. I guess I am debating if this is worth updating him on.", "I can't disagree.", "If you are very drunk you cannot consent. That is sexual assault.", "Stop drinking around him and stop hanging out with him outside of work. He\u2019s taking advantage of your loosened inhibitions and is clearly very attached to you. This is going to get worse and worse, put up some strong walls and be ready to alert HR (or the police honestly)", "Do not spend timecwith him away from work. Do not drink around him.", "Consent is binary; as in you give consent or don't. The lack of consent means no consent. Frankly, it sounds like you're being taken advantage of, but only you and him really know that. If you no longer want to have relations him then you need to tell him EXPLICITLY with clear, concise, and obvious rejection. It can be as simple as \"No, I do not consent to this activity\". And please, stop hanging out and drinking with him in general.", "I'm sure I'm going against the grain on this one but at some point you're inviting this upon yourself. You cannot keep running back and stringing him along (which is what you're doing) then claim victimhood. \n\nIf you don't want these interactions, stop them. Full stop - and be extremely clear. With what you've described so far HR can't help you much because you've made yourself part of the problem.", "Why are you drinking with your coworkers? That's a hard no for me. One drink or two in a group setting is one thing but I don't advise getting very drunk around coworkers", "You need to report this to HR yesterday. You can leave his name out for now and then if things escalate you have a paper trail.", "Okay I would like to say that I don\u2019t have an \u201calcohol problem\u201d I\u2019m a 22 year old who drinks occasionally when I hang out with people. And I already stated we didn\u2019t have sex. So please get your facts straight before commenting something so ridiculous", "You say that like I never hung out with other people. I have quite a bit. Please understand WHY I have hung out with him. And also understand that we never hung out on a consistent basis. It was very rarely over the course of a year.", "Yes, and that\u2019s something he\u2019s using against you. That\u2019s what abusers do.", "Find another friend. This guy is not safe.", "I want to clarify we have never had sex. It has never gone that far but we did engage in minor sexual activity", "He could also be pretending the family trauma to pull you in closer. I know someone who does this, particularly with women. It's very creepy.", "I don't hate woman, it just really sucks that people don't take personal responsibility for their actions... everything you said could have been prevented by you on multiple occasions...also going forward you probably should stop going for drinks with him, and tell him you can't see him any more...the end", "That's not about hating women. You are still responsible for your actions when you are drunk (as is Carl). Hell, you're responsible for getting drunk in the first place. It is incredibly frustrating to listen to people complain about the bad decisions they make when they get drunk and yet continue to get drunk. That is gender-neutral.\n\nYou have to end the friendship. You. All by your lonesome. That guy is an abusive creep. You don't live together. You are not financially dependent on him. You cannot trust him (or yourself) when you are inebriated. Make a new friend and tell that guy to do the same.", "What if he's drunk too?", "A lot of my social circle is with my co-workers. My current roomate was one of my co-workers. Many of them are great people. Unfortunately this one just wasn\u2019t.", "YOu are in denial about your alcohol problem. Ask a doctor, or anybody in AA:\n\n  \n\" Although when I am heavily drinking I have never stopped it but the morning after I felt disgusted with myself. \" .**. WHEN your life is like that, you DO HAVE an alcohol problem.**", "Youre not the asshole for telling him no. Your an asshole to yourself for continuing to make excuses about your own behavior. Please look at your actions objectively.", "That is still sexual assault honey", "He actually is an alcoholic.", "You obviously don\u2019t live in the Midwest", "Even if they are both inebriated?", "Stop spending time with him outside of work. If you do that you wont be drunk around him. Unless you two are getting drunk at work then thats a whole other can of worms.", "I\u2019m from the Midwest, and it took me moving away to realize I had an unhealthy relationship with alcohol because it\u2019s so normalized. \n\nThat said, even if you don\u2019t have a problem, being 22 and having fun does not excuse the fact that you are mistreating yourself. Waking up disgusted at yourself is fucking yourself over in the long run. Stop drinking around this person if you can\u2019t trust yourself to be on your own side.", "I live in the Midwest, I know what it\u2019s like to be 22 and have fun. You\u2019re involving yourself in a very dangerous situation and refusing to accept that alcohol can be a factor. That\u2019s not Midwest fun, that\u2019s 20\u2019s arrogance fueled by a love of drama. If you\u2019re disgusted by your own actions STOP DOING THEM.", "Not all in the midwest are alcoholics.", "You may not be an alcoholic but you do have an \"alcohol \" problem. The problem being that you can easily be sexually assaulted when you drink. The problem is that you do things or accept things that make you feel dirty. It is indeed a problem that resulted from the consumption of alcohol.  \n\nDrinking socially at 22 is not the problem. Just the results of said drink. \n\nKnowing that his feelings have been acknowledged,  that you still participated in sexual acts (if oral or anal were involved then you indeed did have sex. It's not all about PIV or penetration in general), and then you admittedly miss him and reconnect. Whether you mean to or not, you are leading him on. I would completely distance myself....even if I have to get a new job. \n\nHim taking advantage of your drunkenness on top of the fact that he knew you since you were barely legal while having 3 decades in age on you makes him a creep. I would find a new job and get far away from him. He can't be trusted around you and you can't trust yourself with liquor in you.", "Hey, don\u2019t listen to assholes like that. First of all, there\u2019s nothing wrong with you. None of this is your fault and you deserve to be treated with respect. Please find people you trust, a support system, reach out and communicate with them so you have safe spaces and safe people to be with. This man is, uhhhh, fucking insane.", "Yup. There is a clear aggressor here. This dude will not take no for an answer as we can see in the post. Even if they are both inebriated, (OP has stated that she has been extremely inebriated when this happens) the fault is going to fall on the one who is aggressively pursuing OP and not taking her no for an answer.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing with any of these comments insinuating I have a drinking problem. I know I do somewhat. Although I don\u2019t drink daily, when I do I have a hard time knowing where my limits are, and that is my downfall.", "Ok - Got it.", "Learning your limits is important, but doing it with a safe group of people is essential.  I would cut off this guy completely, but at the very least just make it a rule you don\u2019t drink around him anymore.", "OP, there's no judgment here, but I do want to share an experience with you.\n\nI wasn't coping the best in early 2022, and one way I dealt with that was drinking.  Excessively.  Not every day, maybe once a week.\n\nI stopped binge drinking because that winter, I got drunk four times and two of those nights ended in small head injuries.\n\nWhat this man is doing to you, how you're waking up, is way worse than my bumps on the head, or ruining my favorite t-shirt with vodka vomit.\n\nIt might be worth quitting for a few months to see how you feel.  I used Lent 2022, and by the time Easter rolled around, my cravings were gone and I felt better without it.  Now, I'll have one or two with friends, but the company keeps me accountable.\n\nI also want to mention that\n\n>I have a hard time knowing where my limits are\n\ncaught my attention.  If this happens every time, that's binging.  If it seems to only happen around certain folks, though, there's a chance they're slipping something into your drinks that is making you hit that limit quickly and abruptly.", "Hi, I also was once 22 and I also still have difficulties knowing where my limit is.\n\nSo I don\u2019t drink in unsafe situations (like around people who may try to rape me) and I have hard rules I stick to (no alcohol if I haven\u2019t eaten all day/am starving, I have to drink a glass of water before having any alcohol, and I limit myself to one drink if I am not eating a meal) in order to stay within my known limits. Please know I am not criticizing you, I just want you to be safe. I am very lucky that when I have always had people looking out for me during those times I exceeded my limits and it sounds like you don\u2019t have that (it doesn\u2019t help that you \u201cfriend\u201d has predatory intentions)."]}
