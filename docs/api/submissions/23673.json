{"id": 23673, "submission_id": "15fj714", "title": "AITA for telling my co-worker that we will never be married?", "selftext": "I (22F) have worked with my co-worker (we\u2019ll call him Mark) for almost four years. Mark just turned 52 a couple of months ago. We recently just started becoming close over the past year. It started off as an innocent friendship but has increasingly gotten worse the more time has passed. Months ago I had noticed his behavior around me was different than how he treated our other co workers. I later confronted him about it and asked if he had feelings for me, at first he had denied it but soon admitted that he had and it just wasn\u2019t something he wanted to admit because of our vast age difference. \n\nNow, I want to clarify that I do not have romantic feelings for him but because of how close we have grown to each other I do feel a strong emotional connection to him. I am ashamed to admit that we have engaged in some sexual activity \u2014 usually initiated by him. Although when I am heavily drinking I have never stopped it but the morning after I felt disgusted with myself. He would try to kiss me sober and I would always push myself away because again, it was wrong to me. I would like to clarify we have never had sex although he has been trying. \n\nI feel like this is my fault because his feelings for me make me extremely uncomfortable so I will tend to push myself away but miss our conversations and start talking again and the cycle just repeats itself. When we do talk, it is nothing short of toxic. He is very controlling regarding my friendships with guys, he has called me several hurtful names (i.e. slut, cunt, bitch). I feel like it\u2019s worth saying I have only slept with two men and both of those men I was in long term relationships with so I feel like it is unwarranted to call me such names. He always apologizes and begs for forgiveness and I am always dumb enough to talk to him again. \n\nHe always tells me that we are going to be married and gets offended and aggressive when I shut him down and tell him how wrong it is.  I know I need to cut ties all together because this whole situation is just entirely fucked up and I wish I would\u2019ve never asked if he had feelings for me. If we didn\u2019t work together this would be way less harder, but we do. Am I the asshole for telling him we will never be married? Any advice on how to proceed forward?\n\nEDIT: I guess I kind of want to clear some stuff up as well as providing an update to the situation. First I want to thank those who were kind to me in regards to the situation it helped me confront Mark about everything. To clear some things up for those who think I am just an alcohol attention seeking woman who can\u2019t take accountability for anything\u2026\n\nI NEVER said I didn\u2019t hold myself accountable for letting it escalate as far as it did. I am so angry with myself because I let it go on as long as it did. But something people fail to understand is I thought we shared a kindred bond because we both had similar childhoods, he recently lost his father, and when I was 12 I lost my grandfather who was basically a father to me so we connected on that, we connected because his mother is a narcissistic piece of shit like my father is\u2026I was able to confide in him about basically everything. I liked having someone in my life that understood me and I was scared to lose it. \n\nFor those who say I am lonely and have no friends. That is not true, I have plenty of friends on a superficial level. Some of you are acting like he is the only person I\u2019ve hung out with and he isn\u2019t. I have plenty of friends that are my age and yes some that are even older. As far as the drinking, I also take accountability for that. But I am NOT an alcoholic. I do have a problem recognizing my limits and that is something I am going to try working on, because I don\u2019t want to end up in a situation like this or worse again. When I refer to Mark as an alcoholic, I am not loosely throwing that term around to make me look better. He is by definition, an alcoholic and will admit it himself. Every day at 5:00 he starts drinking and will sometimes drink until he is incoherent. I have tried helping him, and he refuses telling me it is none of my concern.    \n\nI understand that I am an idiot but some of you are completely rude and just insensitive and I didn\u2019t ask for any of it. I simply came on here to ask for sincere advice. So to those that have been kind, thank you so much. \n\nNow for the update because I don\u2019t know how to post an update on here: \n\nI wrote out a long message to Mark (I won\u2019t quote verbatim because it is a lot) explaining that we can no longer maintain any sort of relationship because neither of us will get what we want out of each other. I admitted and apologized for the part that I had played in this mess while also pointing out his fault as well. I explained to him why it was so hard for me to let go, I again explained to him that the 30 year age difference is wrong, and that the names he has called me are also wrong. I again apologized and wished him the best. \n\nHis reply is what I thought they would be, a series of messages telling me that I am pure evil and I am by far the worst person he has ever met\u2026.etc. \n\nI blocked him after the 7th message. I am supposed to open with him tomorrow so I will try to keep anyone posted. \n\nThank you again.", "created_utc": 1690911360, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15fj714/aita_for_telling_my_coworker_that_we_will_never/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only way to deal with him is to totally ghost. No interaction. If he is a supervisor and persists threaten to report him. Getting aggressive when you don\u2019t get your way is for 4 year olds. He is literally threatening you with violence so he gets what he wants. Leave leave leave.", "You need to learn what boundaries are and how to build them and enforce them. I highly recommend counseling and not drinking in his presence\u2026perhaps not drinking at all until you can feel safe and confident in your ability to stick up for yourself.

I\u2019ve been in plenty of toxic relationships and the best things I ever did for myself are (in this order!) broke up with and cut contact with the guy, got a puppy, made great girl friends who REALLY looked out for each other, went to counseling and learned a ton about myself. \n\nAs far as the basic judgement, I say NTA\u2026this guy is a super predator and seems to take advantage of your weakest moments- drunk/drinking, lonely, etc. Any way you can transfer to a different department or something to get away from him? Better yet, a different branch or location and change your number? Break it off completely and when he starts harassing you, file a police report and get a restraining order- even a temporary one.

You were 18 when you started working with this man when he was 48. That\u2019s a HUGE age difference, and it\u2019s honestly inappropriate for a man 30 years your senior to strike up a friendship with you when you were a teenager. When you realized he had a romantic interest in you, you told him how you felt and declined his advances. Any responsible man would realize that you\u2019re not truly into him if you reject him when you\u2019re sober but will hook up with him when you\u2019re intoxicated. There\u2019s a very good possibility that he has seen this pattern and is taking advantage of you by continuing to make advances towards you when he knows you\u2019re drunk. Then you said he\u2019s controlling towards other friendships you have and verbally abuses you? \n\nThis sounds like a man who has groomed you into becoming part of a relationship you never wanted to be in, and now you\u2019re trapped. You need to put a very clear stop to all contact with him outside of work\u2014tell him specifically you no longer welcome his friendship and he is not to contact you further\u2014and you need to keep all contact with him at work as sparse as possible and as professional as possible. I\u2019d also suggest that you take care to never drink in this man\u2019s presence again, and I\u2019d honestly suggest reporting him to HR.

Also, Don't put  yourself in a situation where your judgement is impaired when he is present, such as company events or parties where alcohol is consumed, or after work casual get-togethers. Just don't drink at such events for a while, until you are certain that he  understands that you are serious, and you know he has accepted the situation. For a while after that, make certain you have a friend with you to help run interference any time you know you will be in the same place at the same time outside of official work.\n\nAs for how to set boundaries and cut off personal contact, you just have to lay it out for him once and for all, tell him that you have considered him a friend, and you have let things go farther than you are comfortable with, so it is going to end now. From this point forward, you will only interact with him at work, and only with regards to work. He needs to leave you alone. If it helps him, he can think of you as an Ex. Ex-friend, Ex-companion, Ex-whatever works in his brain. But you are done with any relationship potential.\n\nIf he refuses to accept that, and continues to try and interact with you nonprofessionally, report it to HR as harrassment. If he seems unhinged about it, immediately take whatever other actions seem appropriate (walking away, calling for help, eventual restraining orders, etc).\n\nI feel some concern over your story because I briefly worked for a man who was obsessed with a former coworker. He had a picture of her on his desk, told me that she was his fiancee and talked about the house he was having built for her, etc. A former collegue of his stopped by office one day to talk to him, and came back after the boss left for lunch to \"warn me\" after seeing the picture, and explained why he was no longer employed with his former firm. Turns out the \"fiancee\" was actually engaged to someone else, and had to have a restraining order put into place against my boss. Even with that, he would not accept that she had no interest in him. He really was having a house built for her.  I got out of there not long afterward, so I have no idea how that ultimately played out, but you know it wasn't good.", "You have to stop. You've got a real problem on your hands. It is going to be very hard for you to go to HR if he escalates because you admit choosing to keep the cycle going. If I were in your shoes, I would be looking for a transfer to a different department or an entirely new job. This is why we keep entanglements out of the office and don't drink to the point of bad decision making. Making either of those mistakes once is understandable. Keep repeating the mistakes,  that is on you.", "NTA- eww and that is so freaking creepy.\n\nWhen you have consumed alcohol you are not sober and not able to make judgment calls the way when you are sober.  You are not able to give consent to sexual activity when you have been drinking heavily.\n\nHim attempting to initiate sexual activity while you are not sober, is not okay.  And potentially illegal depending on where you are.\n\nYou should break off the friendship.  You should let HR know.  You should not be around this person.\n\nBecause if trying to initiate sexual contact when someone who has been drinking heavily is something the routinely doing this is not a good person to be around.\n\nWith you or anyone else I don't care.  If I see a guy who keeps trying to hit up a girl while she's drunk, I'm not going to think that's a good person to be around.\n\nAlso wouldn't let leave him alone with someone who was heavily drinking", "NTA this guy obviously has anger and boundary issues. His behaviour is unacceptable. I suggest you may have to take a restraining order against him, because his behaviour is dangerously close to being out right criminal. You\u2019re own personal safety may be in jeopardy. This is NOT NORMAL way for a person to act", "Giiirl this is not going to end well for you. Is it possible to get a different job? Honestly you gotta cut him off and make it clear there\u2019s no chance of anything happening again. Don\u2019t drink around him. Try to have a trusted person with you while you\u2019re around him. Maybe he\u2019ll get mad and call you names but don\u2019t internalize that shit he\u2019s just a creepy asshole", "Yeah, you guys are gonna end up getting married if you keep having contact with him. You should know that right off the bat. You're being an AH for continuing to have the same relationship knowing that he has feelings for you. AND also knowing that's he's bit crazy, you're not doing yourself a favor. Distance yourself completely from him and reach out to HR if necessary.", "Wow, way to victim blame OP. \n\nGreat going! /s\n\nIn all seriousness, OP is a *victim* of an abusive, manipulating predator. He is *30 years* her senior and cannot find a woman his own age to be with, so he targeted OP. There are *very* good reasons why relationships with a large age gap between the couple are looked upon in a negative light. It usually boils down to people the older partners age will not put up with their BS, so they find a younger person who they can manipulate.", "Don't blame yourself,  he knows what he's doing.", "Te thing is many people do things when they are drunk they normally wouldn\u2019t do. So don\u2019t be so tough on yourself. You\u2019ve got to take care of yourself and I strongly suggest you not drink alcohol with him anymore. He prob likes you to drink so he can get \u201cromantic\u201d. I\u2019m very concerned he may try to use a date rape drug on you. He is verbally abusing you as well as trying to control you. Stay away from him socially and limit contact at work as much as possible. If it gets too stressful at work, maybe you can go to another department, talk to HR or even look for another job as a last option. Of course, it should be him looking for another job but life\u2018s too short to stay in a toxic environment. You\u2019re young and have your whole life ahead of you and don\u2019t waste anymore time on this creep.", "Go to HR immediately.  Do not pass go, do not collect $200. \n\nDo not blame yourself for him being able to manipulate you. It\u2019s not your fault this man is choosing to treat you so badly", "Never met a real 22 year old before eh?", "I think because this is a pattern of aggressive behavior that spans their working and after-work relationship, it is safe to assume that his predatory actions are not caused by being drunk (even if he is an alcoholic). And even if they were caused by him being drunk, at some point, he needs to take responsibility for his own behavior as a grown ass man preying on a woman 30 years younger than him and harassing her when she tries to set boundaries or distance herself from him. There are plenty of alcoholics who don't sexually assault people.", "The victim that can\u2019t help but talk to this man? Get real. Society is quick to throw that label out there these days and it diminishes actual victims. \n\nObviously this guy is a shit person, based on OP\u2019s description. However, there\u2019s no ownership in her post of what she did. And it\u2019s often true that the people throwing out labels (like alcoholic) that are the catalyst of their own problems. It\u2019s very simple: stop drinking around him. Stop going to situations where he\u2019s there. And if he continues to presse the issue (he most likely will), then that\u2019s when we should go boohoo OP.", "What you need to do is cut off all non work communication with him. If you start to miss your conversations with him, remind yourself of how you\u2019re feeling right now. Write it all down and look at it daily if you have to. Tell him your boundaries and if he oversteps at work, report him to HR. Seek therapy.", "That was my concern too. If he hasnt, he prob will and I hope OP stops all socializing with him.", "Instead of blaming a victim on Reddit you should educate yourself on manipulation tactics.", "You need to see a therapist to understand why you\u2019re doing what you\u2019re doing. What you are looking for here is way beyond our pay grade.", "The \u201cvictim\u201d \u2026. Right. You need to go outside more."]}
