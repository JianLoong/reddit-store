The food that you paid for with your money that he ate (stole)? How many times has he given you the money it cost? How many times has he bought you replacements?", "NTA. You talked about it, you told him you didn't like him eating your stuff and how that made you feel, you asked him to stop doing this, and he still did it again anyway. It's totally understandable that you yelled at him", "NTA. I'd say lock your food up, but needing to do so is probably a sign you shouldn't be with this person. If he knows your ED tendencies and is leaving you without food in the house, that's genuinely dangerous for your health. Someone who loved and cared for you would be buying extra noodles for you and reminding you to eat. This does not sound like love to me.", "Are you sure you want to marry someone that is taking all of your food? He's 31 and he's eating your vegan stuff and drinking your almond milk. He's being lazy and selfish. I'd get my own fridge and padlock it. NTA. \n\n>Ah yeah, no I wasn\u2019t because he drunk all my almond milk. I said okay I\u2019ll just eat noodles, he ate my noodles and left the empty box. I said okey I\u2019ll make a parfait I have those light and fit yogurts that taste like desert and some granola. Well he ate my yogurts and all the granola.\n\nNope.", "nta", "NTA. He leaves *empty boxes* of your food on the shelf. That puts me over the moon with anger. What point is there to leaving empty boxes except to conceal the food is gone? You'll look at the box and think everything's fine, only to discover it when you don't have an alternative. \n\nA partner should not continuously eat your food after you've talked to him about it. He thinks you're a jerk cause you're calling him out --well buddy, who made OP hangry? The people who hate boundaries are the ones who want to ignore them.", "Ew", "You know what I have a good marriage but the worst thing my husband does is this.\n\nBut your situation is much worse due to your dietary needs and ED history.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t got the most healthy approach to eating if he sees a package containing the last portion or two or something and figures he \u2018may as well\u2019 finish it off. \n\nThis might sound out of place and random, so I\u2019m sorry, but can\u2019t help wonder if he smokes weed and gets uncontrollable munchies but this part of the situation is normalised in your relationship and overlooked as a contributing factor? Because in this situation where you woke him up to shout at him, that\u2019s a lot of indiscriminate eating. \n\nAnyway this is quite a serious issue. You\u2019re doing so well in spite of this but if you\u2019re going to live with someone or have them around a lot they need to respect your needs surrounding food and eating.", "NTA. This is what I call \"bad roommate\" behavior by a romantic partner. Was he an only child? My brother and I would've fought to the death over something like this as kids. I wouldn't dare as an adult!", "NTA, words have not worked, time to buy a little lockable fridge and lockable food box for the pantry.  My mum would eat in her sleep, so I would hide the pantry food in my room, and had a lockbox I kept in the fridge", "NTA. Please don't marry this person.", "This might be a touch petty, but put a sticky note on each thing that's yours. \"OP's food. DO NOT EAT. I DO MIND.\"\n\nEvery time he eats something of yours, hide something of his. \"I didn't think you'd mind.\"\n\nGood luck, OP. ETA: NTA.", "Nta, but honestly you need to be more assertive, nothing is going to change if you say it without a bit force. I say this because your guy is a bit dense and cant seem to catch on well.", "Not necessarily the AH considering your situation. I went through this a long time ago with a now ex. She'd always bitch me out for eating the last of something and not save her any. Problem was she really didn't eat and would let it sit, and sit and eventually go bad. She was the AH. However in THIS situation, he is. Not you.", "EEW.  This guy literally doesn't care if you have enough food to eat to live.  \n\nImagine him doing this shit to you while you're pregnant.\n\nImagine him eating all your kids' food and letting them go hungry.\n\nThat is your future with this greedy, inconsiderate, gluttonous ass...\n\nDon't do this to yourself, please!!", "NTA it looks like some kind of power play by him. Either way asshole move by fianc\u00e9 and I would just drop him.", "You are so NTA. This seems like a powerplay and he gets off on screwing you over. Start donating his food to the local food pantry. He won't think it's so cute anymore when it's his food and money that are gone \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffb", "Don\u2019t marry him. I\u2019m serious.", "NTA\n\nThink about the future.  Would you be ok if he did this when you were sick?  Or if you find out you have an allergy/intolerance, only eating certain things but can't because he ate them without thinking about you?  What if you got pregnant and decided his habits override your needs? \n\nHe won't change permanently.  He might be able to stop just to get you off his back for a short time but he returns to this behavior and does not think about you. \n\nIf you really want him, try couples counseling to see if this could work.  Don't get married right away.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nHis behaviour shows a lack of respect or care. He doesn't listen and your feelings are ignored. Huge red flags for how your marriage might be like.", "Tell him that you're not ok about sharing anymore.  Ask him to always ask you if he wants some of the specific food you've bought. Ask him to confirm and agree that he won't donthis anymore, and see if he understands why you are asking. \n\nI assume you already have a specific shelf or container where you put your specialised food?  Remind him this is off limits.\n\nIf he objects to any of this or if he still continues to take your stuff, seriously reconsider marrying him.", "NTA but once he's awake have another conversation. Start by apologizing for letting your temper get the better of you but admit that you can't promise it won't happen again because of the severity of what happened. List calmly how many of your food stuff have been eaten. Reiterate that you eat the way you do to treat a chronic illness. That however odd it seems to him you will always eat slowly, leave parts for later and the only time it is acceptable to eat the last of something of yours is if he physically has a replacement in his hands to put there. Tell him clearly that this is a significant lifestyle incompatibility and you need to figure it out if you two want to keep living together. If he at any points tries to say you're overreacting, calmly respond \"The fact you think this is an overreaction tells me that you aren't understanding the situation.\"", "Does he exhibit similar thoughtless behaviors in other areas? If yes, he is probably not a good long term partner. If not, he might be someone who has to be trained to understand these things. Some people are not bad people per se, but don\u2019t understand dietary restrictions etc. \n\ncan you buy some bright colored tape (neon pink for example) and put it on all the things that he shouldn\u2019t eat? If even that doesn\u2019t stop him, then he might be doing it on purpose and that would be a huge problem indeed.", "NTA\n\nIt doesn\u2019t sound like a pretty good relationship when your fianc\u00e9 is so selfish he eats his food and yours too without a care in the world that there is nothing for you to eat.  \n\nYou might wish to take a more objective look at your relationship as I suspect this isn\u2019t the only area of your life where he puts himself first and you aren\u2019t even an afterthought. \n\nIf the rest of the relationship is actually perfect they make locking boxes that fit in the refrigerator or cupboard.", "I eat my wife's food all the time. But I ask first and buy replacements. \n\nNTA", "NTA Something is seriously wrong with him.\n\nNobody can be this cruel to repeatedly keep doing the same thing.\n\nHe definitely doing it deliberately.   \n\nThis is soo passive aggressive.", "do you want to marry that tool? NTA", "INFO: why are you marrying someone that doesn't give a fuck about you?", "NTA and this is a red flag for this relationship. He is sabotaging your recovery from Ed and your health.", "NTA, my fianc\u00e9 does this with sugary snacks (including with stuff he\u2019s bought me for Valentines etc.) even though he\u2019s diabetic to the point that he  shouldn\u2019t eat them at all?! So, he doesn\u2019t buy any for him but just eats mine and then moans about his bloody sugar\u2026 \n\nThe excuse is \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want it! It\u2019s been 2 weeks and some was left so thought you didn\u2019t like it!\u201d NO!! I\u2019m the kind of person who savours my faves (if there\u2019s 4 flavours of something in a packet I\u2019ll get through them in reverse order). He knows this. I\u2019ll share but I want to be asked! I have PCOS and watch my weight so if I want the occasional sugary indulgence you can bet I\u2019m really looking forward to something very specific so if that\u2019s gone it\u2019s INCREDIBLY annoying. Fully with you. It\u2019s actually stealing now you\u2019ve said \u201cno\u201d over and over.", "ESH. Why yell? Sit down, and talk to them like a human being would do.", "NTA - Give back the ring.", "NTA. This isn't a relationship, this is abuse. You have a diagnosed ED (most often caused by abusive loved ones)  so you know you're dealing with a cycle of abuse that you need to break if you ever want to recover. It hurts, but at least you can still move forward.", "NTA\nI would consider this a form of control and therefore a form of abuse.  He is taking away your ability to feed yourself. He is limiting the food available to you,  even though you purchase this food for yourself. You say you are recovering from and ED and he is making this more difficult, I would consider this emotional abuse. Maybe he doesn't know he's doing this, maybe it's unintentional. But he ia taking your fodd intentionally and that has to stop now.  This is unacceptable behavior.", "I don't get why he doesn't get it. Unless he has an Ed too? Where's his food, can you buy more things for him to eat?", "Even my kids know not to touch my safe foods. I can\u2019t imagine the mental strain of this relationship.", "I don't have allergies, but I'm vegan, and it is SO COMMON for omnivores to eat all the stuff I can eat and leave leftovers of what I can't. Anyone on any kind of restricted diet can tell you the same story. My diabetic colleague's carefully-planned lunch has been stolen twice. My lactose-intolerant colleague kept getting her lactofree milk drunk. People are pigs.", "1. He's done this before, and he knows you wanted it.\n2. He's done this before, and he knows you wanted it.\n3. He's done this before, and he knows it's a big deal.\n4. He's done this before, and he knows you mind.\n\nIs he actually capable of learning from his mistakes? Maybe you need to take him to an animal trainer... I've heard of dog trainers  who have been able to train husbands to not be jerks... NTA.", "This guy is full of shit. He doesn't respect you, and he doesn't love you. You just don't do those kinds of things to someone you love again and again and again AFTER being told to stop it. \n\nI don't care how much he loves almond milk. He buys his own and leaves yours the hell alone. If you bother to wrap up ONE BITE of something and put it in the fridge, it's hands the fuck off. \n\nJust an aside, because honestly, I think you need to do some serious reconsidering here. Do you put your name on your things? You shouldn't need to, and I don't think it would mean a hoot to him, mostly just curious.\n\nAre you ready to spend your life having to fight for the food you pay for and prepare? Because he has made it very clear he's not going to respect the very reasonable boundary of *don't eat my food, damnit*!", "Nobody is this obtuse. He's not a complete idiot right? You're being way too nice about this. His behavior is malicious. He's sabotageing your eating process.\n\nIt's your weak point, your vulnerability, and he's attacking that.\n\nMaybe it's about control, about power or some weird kink. It doesn't matter.\n\nThis guy is bad news.", "But you told him you do mind. Why doesn't he listen?\n\nHe's being a shitty husband, OP. This is more than just a series of blunders. This is utter carelessness, he just doesn't give a shit about your happiness and wellbeing.", "1,2 and 4 can all be solved if he does one simple thing : ASK YOU\n\nSorry but he is talking nonsense... Especially now that you have already had a conversation about this issue, there is no excuse to eat all of your food at the same time. As for point 3, did he? Buy you more I mean?", "Then let him buy you more.  He should pay you back for a new pack every time whether he ate 1/2 or even a bite.", "These are all lies. You have told him you will get to it and you do mind. Why does he think he can lie to you?", "Some people mind if there are a lot of containers in the fridge so the focus is on finishing up food before starting new food. Worth discussing as he will need to retrain himself in this case. Where is the pressure to \u201cget to it\u201d coming from? \n\nIf he\u2019s planning to replace it, he needs to make sure he has replaced it before eating your food, not leave you empty. I feel your frustration as a celiac, but also it\u2019s not fair to tell people they can\u2019t eat food that happens to be \u201csafe\u201d when they like it too. Making sure there is always enough of whatever it is for at least one serving is a more reasonable rule.\n\nNTA", "My ex did something similar, I woke him up and said that I would smother him if he EVER touched my food again. \ud83d\ude05\ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffd", "Another level of disturbing: he knows she can't treat him this way because he can have her food but she can't eat his.\n\nImagine having a full pantry and still being such an asshole that you bypass all of that perfectly good food and eat the few things your supposed loved one can eat, uncaring if they're left with anything much at all.\n\nI've been on the receiving end of this, but with an abusive parent.\n\nIt was an intentional way to be selfish toward me, to be cruel. And I don't think it's much different for OP because this isn't a new thing.", "\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47\ud83e\udd47", "Yeah this seems deliberate and cruel to me.

He can totally fix a shitty bf heheheh"]}
