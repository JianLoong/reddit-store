I\u2019m a very small woman only 4\u201911 and I\u2019ve always struggled with Ed mostly binging. For once in my life I\u2019m listening to my hunger cues and I only eat when I\u2019m actually hungry and stop when I\u2019m not. This has led to me eating 1-2 times a day. And sometimes I don\u2019t finish it all because I\u2019m full. I always save it for later if I feel hungry I\u2019ll eat it. I went to the doctors who stated that\u2019s perfectly fine. \n\nI\u2019m also a pescatarian but I mostly eat non meat products. Beyond, gardien, morning star, impossible, etc. I also don\u2019t drink normal milk because it makes me sick so I drink almond milk. My fianc\u00e9 is not he eats meat, drink normal milk, and eats 3 times a day. So we often buy different items to suit our needs. However he always manages to eat my stuff. I brought specialized noodles from Korea, he ate them. I leave my left overs in the fridge he eats them. I make enough for today and tomorrow he\u2019ll eat my portion and his because I didn\u2019t eat mine within a day. He will eat my special vegan and vegetarian food even though he has his own meat products.\n\nI talk to him about him, I said I\u2019m fine with sharing but please ask. And to not be selfish by eating the last of something that\u2019s mine. He apologized and did as I asked. It lasted about 2-3week. Well today I guess he decided to stop. I didn\u2019t wanna cook so I made myself an egg sandwich with fries (air fryer). That was at around 3pm. I felt hungry at around 9pm so I decided I eat some cereal. Ah yeah, no I wasn\u2019t because he drunk all my almond milk. I said okay I\u2019ll just eat noodles, he ate my noodles and left the empty box. I said okey I\u2019ll make a parfait I have those light and fit yogurts that taste like desert and some granola. Well he ate my yogurts and all the granola. He was sleeping I admit I was angry so I woke him up and yell to stop eating my shit. I feel bad, and like I\u2019m an ass for yelling at him. But I feel like the little time I do eat I don\u2019t have a selection because he eats everything. \n\nAITA?\n\n\nEdit: this blew up wow. Anyway I cannot answer everyone so I\u2019ll simply answer here:\n\n1. Does he replace my food. Most of time he will but if anyone knows non meat opinions you know unless beyond its often limited in stores. So sometimes he can\u2019t.  Like for example the fake chicken Pattie\u2019s I eat I cannot find them anymore so he hasn\u2019t replaced them. \n\n2. People ask does he have Ed. He\u2019s not formerly diagnosed but I believe he does. I think he has bed like me, but he doesn\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve watched him eat an entire family size bag of chips. But he says it fine, I think like me it\u2019ll take him time to actually come to that realizations, so I don\u2019t push it. We are going up couples counseling not because things are bad besides this but because I actually believe all people should before they get married, he agrees. \n\n3. Does he control my life? This kinda made me laugh because I\u2019m the farthest thing from controlled. I do what I want when I want. My clothing, hair, nails, beliefs, schedule, etc are all mine. I can go out anytime, I can\u2019t dye my hair any color, I can wear whatever I want. So nope no control. Unless you think this is controlling. \n\n4. He\u2019s probably abusing you low key . No, he\u2019s never raised his voice at me, hit me, push me, restrict me, verbally abuse me etc. In fact the first time I heard him do so (yell) was when a car nearly hit us while driving. It was on my side and he became upset because I was shaken up. Also when a family member called me a b he yelled at him. \n\n5. You buy all the food. No actually I don\u2019t. Most of the time we split the food cost, but he usually pays a higher portion. Example if the food is 200 he will be 125 I\u2019ll pay 75.\n\n6. He controls your food intake and what you eat. I pick out my own food, as well how much I eat. We\u2019ve restricted things in our house if we knows it triggers me. We don\u2019t have chips, ice cream, or full sugar drink anymore. All which I can and have binged on. \n\n7. Do you yell at him often? Nope. We never fight actually. This is the first thing im say we fought about. I became frustrated after every time I went to get something it was gone. \n\n8. I\u2019m going to talk to him, I\u2019ll come back with an update if I can.\n\n9. He doesn\u2019t want you to get better. He does when I was barely eating at first he ask me to go to the doctor to see if I\u2019m okay. He helps me in the gym with working out. And basically gave up soda and juice for me.\n\n10. He\u2019s selfish in other places. Nope he\u2019s very caring. I won\u2019t go into detail because it would give me away, but he\u2019s helping me a great deal in every way. The little greedy mf just keeps eating my food lol I\u2019m joking about the greed mf part but it\u2019s very annoying,", "created_utc": 1691736820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15o1d2t/aita_for_yelling_at_my_30f_fianc\u00e9_31m_for/", "score": 377, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That is sociopathic behavior!", "NTA but if he's not gonna stand by his promsie to stop, you should buy another fridge and a fridge lock. He'll stop then.", "He's trying to force OP to eat \"normal\" food, I think.", "This. He is (consciously or not) trying to play the role of the ED and control her food.", "THIS 100000x!!!! A man who will do this to you repeatedly despite being asked not to will do this to his children.", "He always replaces it but sometimes he can\u2019t not because he doesn\u2019t want to but because of the limitations of vegetarian and vegan items. Since things like the gardien stuff is limited and often sold out. The same is true for the yogurts.", "He does not smoke weed I actually do. But it doesn\u2019t increase my appetite. I do so for anxiety.", "Nope. I can eat whatever I want when I want as long as he doesn\u2019t eat it. If today I said I want a real hamburger he go buy it for me.", "Yep. This one is a woman whose male partner gobbles up her food, that\u2019s certainly a very common one. But oftentimes it\u2019s a parent who buys separate ice cream for themselves and the kids, and then the other parent eats it or lets the kids eat it. Or it\u2019s a child who bakes a cake or buys a special treat for themselves, and their siblings or parents eat it and make excuses. Or it\u2019s a pregnant woman or diabetic with specialty food and other people eat it.", "Well this is something you only need to talk about one time.\n\n1. If you didn't want it anymore you would throw it away or put a post it on it and say he can eat it\n2. It is only a little left because that is what you wanted, he doesn't need to figure anything out because **it's not his food**\n3. This would be okay if it was occasional and if you **didn't notice** it missing OR if he asked and you said it was okay. Example: in the morning he had no yogurt left, he ate one of yours and after work he brought some more. Just because he can buy doesn't mean he doesn't  **inconvenience** you when he eats what's yours\n4. Well it's not his place to think this in that situation. If he honestly doesn't think you would mind it costs him nothing to ask, to be sure. When it comes to other people's things he can't assume shit.\n\nHe is continually disrespecting you and your boundaries. This requires a serious talk. \n\nIf you decide you can work through it I would say use a post it or sticker system so he can know if he can eat your food.", "He is 100% doing this on purpose, because it's a boundary you've set. \n\nHe doesn't think you are a separate person who has agency, so he's constantly running over your boundaries. This man is not a good person for you.", ">1. I was taking long to get to it so he didn\u2019t think I wanted it. \n\nIt's still yours, no matter how long it's been there. \n\n2. It was only a little left so he figure he finish it off. \n\nHave you told him not to eat your leftovers? Yes? Then it doesn't matter, even that little bit is still yours. \n\n3. I can just buy you more so it shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. \n\nHe very clearly isn't doing this. \n\n4. He didn\u2019t think i mind\n\nThis is the worst one. You've asked him to stop, told him to stop, yelled at him to stop!\n\nHe knows full well that he shouldn't eat your food. The fact that he does it anyway is a clear indication of how much respect he has for you. Find yourself someone who actually cares.", "1. You asked him not to\n\n2. You asked him not to\n\n3. You asked him not to\n\n4. You asked him not to.\n\nHe doesnt respect you, or believe you, or take you seriously, or care about your feelings. He doesn't care he's literally leaving you NOTHING TO EAT. He doesn't care. NTA.", "1) that's not his call to make\n2) that's not his call to make\n3) that's not his call to make\n4) that's not his call to make\n\nOP, it may seem like \"this is just one issue in a good relationship\". But it really is a big issue that involves him dismissing you, your feelings, your medical history, and your needs.", "He's doing this as an abusive power play. He knows he shouldn't eat your food. He knows that you can't eat anything else. He is doing it deliberately, and it is a form of abuse. You need to seriously think about leaving him, as he's not going to stop. As he's getting something, pleasure or a feeling of power, from taking your food and leaving you hungry.", "Joey doesn't share food!", "NTA, why are you engaged to a man who acts this way? He clearly has absolutely no respect for you, he doesn't care about your nutrition, he doesn't care if you go hungry and worst of all, he doesn't care that you have an ED and that he makes that worse for you. That is not love. He is a selfish power tripping AH. Tell him to stay out of your food, or he can stay out of your life.", "Is it sad my thought is get two fridges?  I don\u2019t know enough about ED if that is triggering.", "Oh honey. He doesn't care about you at all.", "So everytime this happens you could say- now you need to go out and buy me some food i can eat -right now. Not in the morning, not when you feel like it but right now. and it has to be the thing i want and if it needs preparation then you have to stand in the kitchen and cook it for me. this is the new way forward. Every single day - five times a day if necessary - until he stops stealing the only food you can eat.", "Does he fucking know you mind now?\n\nThe fact he refuses to even let you know \u201chey I\u2019m finishing off X or Y\u201d means he knows you won\u2019t be happy. He just wants to eat it, and thinks you\u2019ll suck it up.\n\nRelated: does he actually ever go out an buy a replacement after he finishes your food? I\u2019m guessing he never has without you telling him to.", "You do mind, though, so he needs to stop.", "I would make it clear to him, in no uncertain terms:\n\n1. It doesn't matter how long it takes me to get to it, it is mine. DON'T EAT MY FOOD.\n\n2. It doesn't matter how much or how little there is, DON'T EAT MY FOOD.\n\n3. If it isn't a big deal, YOU buy more. Within 24 hours. But never mind about that, just DON'T EAT MY FOOD.\n\n4. It doesn't matter what you think, I do mind. You know I mind. We have discussed at length how I mind and why. DON'T EAT MY FOOD.\n\nNTA but his actions demonstrate indifference to your feelings and a willingness to harm you if you get in the way of his selfish appetite.", "Ok, still though it\u2019s a serious issue regardless of the reason and he needs to take it seriously.", "to claim dominance? holy... what?! he's just a dumbass, there's really not much to it. how anyone upvoted this wiiiiiild take is beyond me, way to escalate things as usual reddit.", "I update information in my posts but I\u2019ll say it here too. He will replace it but the limitations on non meat products is real so sometimes he can\u2019t. I don\u2019t have to ask most of the time. And I think that\u2019s probably the biggest misconception in his mind. I\u2019ll just buy you more no big deal. But that isn\u2019t okay with me.", "I am against unnecessary food waste, but in this case, I would happily throw out all of fianc\u00e9's meat and fresh products, as well as his milk.\n\nThen, buy myself a nice lockable fridge/freezer and a lockable cupboard for all my personal products.\n\nOr maybe I'd just ditch the Fianc\u00e9...", "I mean she could treat him that way if she put a lock on the fridge door and pantry.  I have learned to be creative in my old age to fuck with others.  The irony would be a lock on a fridge or pantry seems to be the cause of some ED this may be the first time it was a solution.", "Nope he doesn\u2019t control me about anything. This is literally our only issue. Sadly, but I think one is enough to spur the relationship.", "To purposely and repeatedly eat up the \"safe foods\" of someone with an ED, when there are several other alternatives is a direct aggression. After being told that this matters to her, his excuse was \"I didn't think it mattered to you.\" Do you think this man has a learning disability? Low IQ? He cannot claim ignorance. So why do you think he is purposely and willingly eating *her* food when he has other options? He may be ignorant about the True nature of his abusive acts, but that is because he refuses to engage with the notion of simply respecting his partner. When you directly continue to do things that specifically harm your partner, that is abusive. It doesn't matter if you choose to truly grasp that fact or not, still abusive.", "Controlling your access to food is the ONLY kind of control he needs. It sounds like he's your ED in human external form. It is not difficult to be thoughtful to your partner. He eats meat, why is he eating out your veg and vegan products. \n\nDo you have a therapist? You may benefit from having some support to face the extent to which this man is undermining your recovery.", "Oh it is. He doesn't respect you. \n\nIf he did he would 1. Ask before taking your food or 2. Never even ask and make his own damn food since he knows why you eat like you do. So yeah, he doesn't care about your health, sadly, and that's not a relationship to be in. \nMy husband has never eaten my food without asking, I have IBS and he knows I need to have certain foods available. He rarely even asks and always, always respects a no.", "Honestly, I don't think it is a control issue, it is a \"don't care about OP that much\" and \"I'm lazy and food is here\" issue.  Those are reason enough to end the relationship, I'm sorry to say.  If you can't be safe in your own house (have safe foods that are respected) it won't be good in the long term for you mentally.", "Best episode ever."]}
