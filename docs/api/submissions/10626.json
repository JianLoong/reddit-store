It\u2019s going on 13yo.  As much as I love my car, it\u2019s getting up there in years and will not remain reliable.  I\u2019m not suggesting we replace it tomorrow, but it would make good sense to start planning now for a new car in the next year or two.  Hubs said he didn\u2019t think it would be a good idea, I should think about a used car.  Ok, cool.  New or used, I don\u2019t really care.\n\nThen he said it was because I don\u2019t take care of the car.  Umm, excuse me??  What the hell does that mean?  He\u2019s the auto mechanic so he\u2019s the one who\u2019s responsible for maintenance.\n\nHe then goes on about a few occurrences that has happened in the past with the car.\n\nScenario 1:  \nI was leaving a store and backing out of my parking spot.  I saw in the rear view that someone else was backing out of a spot behind me.  I slam on the brakes and hit my horn, but dude had gunned it outta there and we hit.  Younger guy with his wife a baby in the car.  He was really apologetic and said his kid was screaming and was just trying to get home.  I\u2019m an insurance broker, so as much as I hate that this happened, I know how it\u2019ll work out.  We were both reversing in a parking lot so at best it would be deemed 50/50 at fault.  I told him as much.  I had a small crack on the side of my bumper and he had a large scuff.  With a sigh, I suggested we just shake hands and go on our way.  It only took him a split second to grin, shake my hand, and get the hell out of there.\n\nI drove with that cracked bumper for close to a year, until\u2026\n\nScenario 2:\nI took my kid camping.  It was a mother/son weekend so hubs stayed home.  Had a pinhole leak in my air mattress on the first night and woke up cold and on the ground.  I couldn\u2019t find the leak to patch it and I\u2019m not dealing with this all weekend.  Jumped in the car and drove us into town to buy a new mattress from Wally World.  Came out and what did I find?  You guessed it\u2026 someone hit my car (same spot) and took off.  Bumper is now severely damaged and the tail light broken.  Hit & Runs are considered not at fault, but still cost us the deductible.\n\nScenario 3:  \nI used to work at an office with a very sweet lady.  Her and I were pretty friendly with each other.  One day, she parked beside me when she returned from lunch.  The wind took her door from her and hit my car.  She made a bee- line to my desk to let me know what happened.  She was very apologetic and offered to pay for the damage.  My car was probably close to 10yo at the time and already had door dings.  The damage she did was not much greater than that so I told her not to worry about it.\n\nSo in the span of 13 years, these scenarios are the best that my husband can come up with.
