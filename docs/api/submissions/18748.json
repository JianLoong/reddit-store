{"id": 18748, "submission_id": "13y0cyf", "title": "AITA for being uncomfortable with my boyfriend's friend calling me \"b***h\"?", "selftext": "For context, I am a 31F living with my boyfriend \"Mike\" who is 34. Mike has a friend \"Victor\" who comes over a lot. Yesterday, Victor came over to watch baseball with Mike. Victor asked me to pass him a beer so I passed one over but I dropped it. It didn't crack open or anything, but he said \"Nice one, bitch.\" I was honestly shocked and said excuse me? He started laughing and Mike joined in. I was very uncomfortable and genuinely didn't know what to say. I told Victor that I didn't appreciate him calling me a bitch. He got super defensive and said he was saying it \"jokingly\". I said it doesn't matter how you were trying to say it, I am uncomfortable. He got very huffy and said I was just being \"sensitive\" and then he said \"and you're probably going to accuse me of being a sexist now aren't you. Can't say anything these days.\" This was wild because A) I didn't say anything about sexism and B) What do you mean \"can't say anything\"? Can't call women \"bitches\" unsolicited anymore? What even was his point here?\n\nMike hadn't said anything during this interaction until I called him out. I asked why he wasn't defending me and he said \"idk babe you're being a bit dramatic.\" At this point I'd had enough so I told them to leave and they went to Victor's to watch the game. Up until this point I thought I was in the right until Mike texted me angrily. He said I'd embarrassed him in front of a friend by being so melodramatic and SJW-y. He said Victor didn't mean any harm, and it was like how my friends call me bitch lovingly/jokingly. He also said it was uncalled for for me to kick him and Victor out of the house when Mike literally lives there. I said it's completely different because my friends make sure I'm okay with it and don't say it in a derogatory manner like Victor did. Plus, my friends are wonderful women who have supported me for years, not some friend of my boyfriend's who I barely know. And I was supposed to just let myself be disrespected in my own home? He called me annoying again and then turned notifications off.\n\nHe slept over last night (Victor lives alone) and hasn't come home yet. I think I might be the asshole because it's true that my friends call me bitch, and although it's different as I said above, it's possible that it confused Victor and made him think that was ok. I also didn't mean to make Victor uncomfortable/put him in the hot seat as a guest in my house. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Accidentally referred to \"Victor\" as \"Lucas\" (these are fake names and I changed my mind halfway through making the post lol)", "created_utc": 1685671998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13y0cyf/aita_for_being_uncomfortable_with_my_boyfriends/", "score": 279, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only correct response from Victor when you told him not to call you that would be \u201cI am so sorry! I won\u2019t call you that again.\u201d Instead, he deflected the blame to you, and he your boyfriend gaslit you. This isn\u2019t right at all that you\u2019re feeling bad. THEY are the ones who are rude and behaved totally unacceptably. Can you move out?", "NTA. I would 100% expect my man to be ready to fight if another man called me a bitch. The least he could've done was tell his friend he couldn't speak to you that way. Would he let his friend call his mom, sister, or daughter a bitch? I highly doubt it, so it's not okay to call you that either.", "NTA\n\nAnd Mike and Victor sound like they should be future roommates.", "NTA. Plenty of men would object to being called bitch.\n\nAnd my opinion is that guys shouldn't call women bitches jokingly unless they are both friends\n\nAlso Victor had no reason to get defensive. You were right to make him leave. He insulted you in your home and doubled down when you called him out", "NTA - And don\u2019t let anyone guilt you into thinking otherwise. Your boyfriend showed you who he is, the kind of company he keeps, and that he\u2019ll choose his friend over you. You deserve to be comfortable and not insulted in your own home, and he dismissed that basic right as you being \u201cdramatic.\u201d\n\nVictor told on himself, because even though you didn\u2019t call it sexist, that\u2019s exactly what it was. And Mike is okay with it. Let them cry it out over beers and call you a b*tch to their hearts\u2019 content at Victor\u2019s house, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be a good idea to welcome your bf back after this.", "NTA. It's not that hard to apologize, and that's what Victor should have done. Then he tried to gaslight you when you pointed out that you weren't okay with that. Your boyfriend also owes you an apology, in my opinion.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're okay being called that by your friends, because you're absolutely right that it's different depending on who says it.", "NTA; these two bro\u2019s can live together and call each other that.", "Nta. Victor might have been joking and might have genuinely thought that it was okay. However the minute you said you didn't like being called a bitch by him Victor should have apologized and that would have been the end of it. It was Victor's refusal to see he had done anything wrong and Mike's refusal to stand with you that caused the problem. Both of them need to apologize.", "NTA - you stood up for yourself and made it clear it was a problem. Your boyfriend then failed to support you being respected in your own house. \n\nWhat your friends call you is your business and not relevant. If you felt disrespected by the way Victor said it, then you are right to call him out and escalate to\nasking them both to leave if your man fails to have your back. \n\nThey both owe you an apology. Especially the boyfriend for failing in the moment to interrupt disrespect and then for gaslighting you to think it was somehow your fault.", "Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuun\n\nNTA. Judge people by their friends.", "NTA and you need to leave his ass", "NTA - You clearly and seemingly politely stated your feelings , all he had to do was apologise and move one. He made a scene not you.", "NTA and dump that BF too that's a heinous attitude to basically agree with his friend and not tell him to cut it out", "NTA. I'm not sure if I'd ever be comfortable with a man calling me bitch. Don't let your bf gaslight you. You were doing the friend a favor by passing a beer and he calls you a bitch in your own home? Bf should have your back not invalidate you.", "NTA for being uncomfortable. If he doesn't know you that well, he doesn't have a right to call you that. Even if he did know you well, calling you a name you aren't happy with isn't acceptable. Your friends know you and know you're fine with it. Your BF should have told him to not call you something that makes you uncomfortable from someone you don't know that well, regardless of whether he meant it jokingly or not. Kicking him out after he was told to not call you that and after your boyfriend sided with him isn't unreasonable.", "NTA. Even if you let friends say that to you, you're not that familiar with your boyfriend's friend. Both of their over-the-top reactions to simply being told that you were uncomfortable with it is further proof that it's not a term of endearment for them. Misunderstandings like that will happen in social settings, it's easy for them to say \"oh, sorry, my bad\" and move on. But doubling down and having such a persecution complex is proof that you're in the right to be uncomfortable with it.", "NTA and don't let his victim playing make you think you are. This is who he is.. pay attention. This is what you're in for.", "The way VictorLucas escalated this is what stands out to me. He could have just said hey I was joking; sorry; won\u2019t do it again, but the sudden defensiveness, the saying you got SJW-y just because you don\u2019t want to be called a bitch? You are NTA, and your boyfriend taking his friends side would have me thinking a LOT about where things are going in this relationship.", "NTA at all! Your boyfriend cares more about his friend\u2019s feelings and his own image to his friend than he does yours. Tough pill to swallow but better to learn it now than years down the line. Respect yourself and don\u2019t tolerate such nonsense. No one gets to tell you how to feel about something. It\u2019s not a joke if you\u2019re not laughing.", "NTA, Victor called you something you don\u2019t want to be called and when you told him you don\u2019t like it he got super defensive, Victor is the a**hole", "Take your time now and think how many times your bf isn\u2019t defending you against his friends.", "NTA - dump the bf now.", "I would have told dear friend his mother is a bitch. You don't call me a bitch in my own home. You don't deserve this clown and you don't deserve his friend. NTA.", "NTA - I\u2019d be pissed too. That was rude and misogynistic. Context and the people involved matter.", "How much do you want to bet that Victor uses the \"Are you going to call me sexist\" and \"You can't say anything these days\" for all kinds of offensive shit and gets away with it because he turns it around on the person who is (rightly) offended. There is no way he's fighting back this hard if it was a one time mistake. I bet you he says lots of nasty stuff.", "NTA if my boyfriends friend called me a bitch (in any manor joking or serious) i would expect him to instantly defend my honor and if he didn\u2019t I would feel uncomfortable and disrespected and I would tell them both to leave. It doesn\u2019t matter what your female friends call you his friends should NEVER feel comfortable calling you a bitch", "NTA, but Victor and your boyfriend are pretty terrible", "You are not being dramatic.\nYou are not wrong.\nYou are NTA.\n\nI have friends that we do joke around calling each other bitch. We KNOW it's said in jest because we know each other. If their husbands called us bitch it would be a very big mistake and they might feel that mistake right quick.\n\nThis guy does not enjoy that level of friendship with you.  Your boyfriend should have defended you. They are both gaslighting you.\n\nEDIT: spelling", "Maybe you could\u2019ve said \u201c that\u2019s okay fvcking a$$hole\u201d.

Or Lucas, lol anyhow, if he's been in the vicinity when you have friends over that call you bitch, ESH. If not, nta.", "I was going with NTA until you admitted that you let your friends call you that same name and it\u2019s okay.  \n\nSo YTA because you have different standards for friends and not friends.  It\u2019s either a derogatory term or it\u2019s a term of endearment and while I don\u2019t think any man should say it to a woman, if they\u2019re hearing you allow you being called it by your friends, in their minds, it must be okay to use it with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your BF also has all the classic excuses of an enabler. \"Victor was joking\", \"he means no harm\", \"you're oversensitive\", \"you're melodramatic\", \"How can you react like this over a joke\" are all excuses made by bullies to shift the guilt on to the victim. Ignore them.\n\nWhile you are at it, you really need to have a serious conversation with your BF and give him once chance to explain himself. The only acceptable explanation in this case is an apology that goes \"I messed up. I'm sorry and I won't repeat it\".

That's ludicrous to say that you're acting \"SJW-y\" for defending yourself when your bf doesn't have the balls to stand up for you. It's probably because he has known Viktor for a long time and they've normalized calling women bitches casually. It doesn't matter if it's joking or not, this isn't a habit that any man who respects women will get into. Guys who call women \"bitches\" casually are low-lives in my experience. You should find a better man for yourself, tbh. Sounds like your bf thinks it's ok to be disrespectful to women and to you! NTA", "NTA\n\nYou weren't being \"SJW-y\", you were being don't-call-me-bitch-motherfucker-you-didn't-even-say-sorry-y", "Nta\nI would've been willing to let it slide if once you were upset, Victor back tracked and apologized.  Doubling down is pretty ridiculous.  Id be done with both of them, honestly.", "NTA... my husband wouldnt stand for anyone treating me with disrespect in my home. He has removed friends for overstepping my boundaries", "NTA \n\nIt\u2019s not unreasonable to not want to be referred to as b****. And the fact that he got defensive about it and tried to jump that you were calling him sexist kinda shows he is. And your bf not defending you is a red flag.", "What you permit, you promote. NTA.. run girl", "NTA. He wasn't joking and your boyfriend is perfectly fine with it. Both these guys are too damn old to act that way and you are doing yourself a major disservice to let it go. You weren't being dramatic you were drawing a clear boundary of not being treated with disrespect, in your own home no less. Pack your shit and go. Let the boys enjoy their bro culture and find yourself a man that's worth being a partner.", "NTA, I hope you get rid of that \"b\"  boyfriend of yours too. Clearly, they don't respect you.", "Absolutely NTA. I would never tolerate this and don't let anyone tell you this is okay, or, \"just a joke.\"", "he said you would probably call him sexist bc he knew he was being sexist. if mike was the one who dropped it he probably wouldn\u2019t have called him a bitch or any other name", "Nta, he didn't mean it lovingly , he meant it as an insult and you had every right to not be insulted in your own hone. Your boyfriend has made his choice. Time to pack your crap and scrape him off", "YTA. I think it is cognitive dissonance to be so offended by a word yet use it to refer to yourself and friends.", "NTA. And what 34 year old man hides at his friends house after he let someone be gross to their partner? Instead of talking like an adult and realizing where he screwed up. Yikes. Since you\u2019re not married you might want to get out of this one while you can.", "NTA. \n\nMy boyfriend\u2019s friends would never call me that, even jokingly, because I am in a relationship with a respectful, adult human who hangs out with other respectful adults. That\u2019s not what you\u2019ve got on your hands here. Both of those guys are garbage and deserve to be kicked to the curb. \n\nAs for Victor being confused that your friends use that word with you\u2026 I mean, maybe, but only if he\u2019s actually a dumb person. You know your friends and their intentions. Victor doesn\u2019t know you like that. You let him know that wasn\u2019t okay and instead of staying in his lane, he tried to make you think you were overreacting. Eff that guy.", "Call him pindick and see how he feels. Maybe he\u2019s too \u201csensitive\u201d. \n\nNTA. Obviously", "Oh OP, you're NTA and I think you've got a boyfriend problem.\n\nIt isn't Victor who's the issue, it's your boyfriend, who remains friends with a guy like Victor because he shares the same values, ethics and approach as Victor.\n\nAnyway, my general rule is that people who use 'SJW' as a derogatory term are generally not people you want to hang out with.", "NTA. Once he knew you didn\u2019t like it he could have just said sorry and moved on. But he made it a negative thing as if you were wrong.", "Please leave. As quickly as possible. Staying with Victor has probably just made him feel more justified", "[removed]", "this", "I used to be fine with that kind of stuff, I mean, it's just a joke.. Now, I would absolutely walk away from a dude like that. I think that even if it starts out jokingly, the connections between that person and the word still form in the SO's mind, and they're more likely to start treating you poorly down the line.", "Victor got defensive cause he knew he'd been caught.  Thereafter he was trying to gaslight and make it so it was OP's fault.  Same as OP's boyfriend.", "and this too", "Truer words...", "I don't think I would be comfortable calling a woman a bitch either. Another guy, sure. But with a woman there is context there that would make it feel too... mean-spirited.", "There is a difference between a friend saying it and a virtual stranger saying it. Yes. Big difference.", "social justice warrior. I had to look it up.", "Social Justice Warrior", "1000%! Run girl.\n\nNot only did he call you a derogatory term, he then doubled down calling you 'sensitive' - something BULLIES say to their victims in order to MINIMISE victims feelings/ response to their behaviour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThen your boyfriend called you dramatic - wow! Something misogynist men throw around to disempower women to create and enforce healthy boundaries against their bad behaviour.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHonestly, it might seem like 'not a big deal' but it's highlighting alarming view points and throwing up red flags that could lead to bigger picture issues. \n\nWould you be treated this way if you had a traumatic birth and didn't want visitors for a few weeks and he called you 'dramatic/ sensitive'..... Just no. RUN.", "It's only ok if you have a close relationship and it's an established thing between you.\n\nOr you've just watched the scary Terry episode of rick and morty and everyone is adding it to the end of every sentence.\n\nClearly not the case here.\n\nYour BF should have gone straight into \"hey dude, not cool. Don't say that.\" \n\nThe fact he's now staying with Victor and thinks treating women like people is \"SJW / woke BS\" is very telling about how he sees you AKA less than him or not a full person.\n\nGet your stuff and get out. \n\nTell the good mutual friends what happened (AKA you got disrespected in your own home and bf sided with the other person)\n\nThen block his ass on every thing", "I feel like I should end things and move in with my sister lol", "Stop considering and *go*. You shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this weird stuff a second time.", "My mom taught me young.  You are the company you keep. \n\n Want to be smarter have smarter friends.  Want to be an abusive asshole, hang out with abusive assholes.", "Mike didn't just defend him, he called you annoying, melodramatic, a SJW, etc. Do you really want to waste anymore time on someone who is so disrespectful to you?", "He\u2019s 34. He has friends who back his behaviour. He isn\u2019t changing so I strongly suggest you change your situation by ending this. There are men out there who AREN\u2019T misogynists", ">I was excusing him by thinking maybe he heard my friend calling me it and thought it was fine, but once I said it wasn't he should have just said \"oh sorry i heard \\[friend\\] say it so i thought it was alright\". Thanks for the help\n\nNo, no. That's not how it works in the mind of someone who isn't a complete wanker.\n\nIf he heard a friend call you that, he still doesn't get to use the term until it's clear that the two of you are good friends and that it's totally acceptable to you.\n\nOnly really good friends, in some cultures, can get away with swearing at each other as a term affection.\n\nYour boyfriend clearly isn't long term material either.", "Good thing then he and Victor can cuddle together as much as they like when OP dumps him. \n\nNTA and NEVER settle for losers like these.", "Especially considering the BF using SJW as an insult after a few hours alone with his charming friend.", "The thing about common sense is that it ain\u2019t that common", "I hope you get out! None of this is ok at all.\n\nAnd please don't let the thought of wasted time make you reconsider staying. Every relationship is a learning experience, and the time isn't wasted just because it doesn't last forever. \n\nWishing you well and sending internet hugs if you want them! \u2665\ufe0f", "These are the RED RED flag you should be watching out for op. This is bigger then being called the B words. It\u2019s the way your boyfriend, who\u2019s supposed be defending you and making sure his friend isn\u2019t being disrespectful, downplaying your feelings,  act like you\u2019re in the wrong for simply wanting to be respected. If it\u2019s like this now, imagine in the long run.", "NTA. When somebody tells you who they are, believe them.", "Update us please. We want to know you\u2019re safe.", "Move out. Don\u2019t tell him. He\u2019ll come home thinking he\u2019ll have worn you down enough with his immature behavior that you\u2019ll apologize. Be gone when that happens.

I was pissed that he didn't even attempt to defend me especially since I literally asked him to..", "BF was such a moron at so many levels in this it wouldn't surprise me if Victor showed him one video by AT and he started talking like that to his **GF** who was in the right!", "My mind set is usually to shoot back, \"What's wrong with being a warrior for social justice? Is there something wrong with wanting all human rights to be respected?\"", "[removed]", "You're not the OP silly bot"]}
