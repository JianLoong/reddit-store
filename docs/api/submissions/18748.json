{"id": 18748, "submission_id": "13y0cyf", "title": "AITA for being uncomfortable with my boyfriend's friend calling me \"b***h\"?", "selftext": "For context, I am a 31F living with my boyfriend \"Mike\" who is 34. Mike has a friend \"Victor\" who comes over a lot. Yesterday, Victor came over to watch baseball with Mike. Victor asked me to pass him a beer so I passed one over but I dropped it. It didn't crack open or anything, but he said \"Nice one, bitch.\" I was honestly shocked and said excuse me? He started laughing and Mike joined in. I was very uncomfortable and genuinely didn't know what to say. I told Victor that I didn't appreciate him calling me a bitch. He got super defensive and said he was saying it \"jokingly\". I said it doesn't matter how you were trying to say it, I am uncomfortable. He got very huffy and said I was just being \"sensitive\" and then he said \"and you're probably going to accuse me of being a sexist now aren't you. Can't say anything these days.\" This was wild because A) I didn't say anything about sexism and B) What do you mean \"can't say anything\"? Can't call women \"bitches\" unsolicited anymore? What even was his point here?\n\nMike hadn't said anything during this interaction until I called him out. I asked why he wasn't defending me and he said \"idk babe you're being a bit dramatic.\" At this point I'd had enough so I told them to leave and they went to Victor's to watch the game. Up until this point I thought I was in the right until Mike texted me angrily. He said I'd embarrassed him in front of a friend by being so melodramatic and SJW-y. He said Victor didn't mean any harm, and it was like how my friends call me bitch lovingly/jokingly. He also said it was uncalled for for me to kick him and Victor out of the house when Mike literally lives there. I said it's completely different because my friends make sure I'm okay with it and don't say it in a derogatory manner like Victor did. Plus, my friends are wonderful women who have supported me for years, not some friend of my boyfriend's who I barely know. And I was supposed to just let myself be disrespected in my own home? He called me annoying again and then turned notifications off.\n\nHe slept over last night (Victor lives alone) and hasn't come home yet. I think I might be the asshole because it's true that my friends call me bitch, and although it's different as I said above, it's possible that it confused Victor and made him think that was ok. I also didn't mean to make Victor uncomfortable/put him in the hot seat as a guest in my house. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Accidentally referred to \"Victor\" as \"Lucas\" (these are fake names and I changed my mind halfway through making the post lol)", "created_utc": 1685671998, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13y0cyf/aita_for_being_uncomfortable_with_my_boyfriends/", "score": 932, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only correct response from Victor when you told him not to call you that would be \u201cI am so sorry! I won\u2019t call you that again.\u201d Instead, he deflected the blame to you, and he your boyfriend gaslit you. This isn\u2019t right at all that you\u2019re feeling bad. THEY are the ones who are rude and behaved totally unacceptably. Can you move out?", "NTA. I would 100% expect my man to be ready to fight if another man called me a bitch. The least he could've done was tell his friend he couldn't speak to you that way. Would he let his friend call his mom, sister, or daughter a bitch? I highly doubt it, so it's not okay to call you that either.", "NTA\n\nAnd Mike and Victor sound like they should be future roommates.", "NTA. Plenty of men would object to being called bitch.\n\nAnd my opinion is that guys shouldn't call women bitches jokingly unless they are both friends\n\nAlso Victor had no reason to get defensive. You were right to make him leave. He insulted you in your home and doubled down when you called him out", "NTA - And don\u2019t let anyone guilt you into thinking otherwise. Your boyfriend showed you who he is, the kind of company he keeps, and that he\u2019ll choose his friend over you. You deserve to be comfortable and not insulted in your own home, and he dismissed that basic right as you being \u201cdramatic.\u201d\n\nVictor told on himself, because even though you didn\u2019t call it sexist, that\u2019s exactly what it was. And Mike is okay with it. Let them cry it out over beers and call you a b*tch to their hearts\u2019 content at Victor\u2019s house, because I don\u2019t think it\u2019d be a good idea to welcome your bf back after this.", "NTA. It's not that hard to apologize, and that's what Victor should have done. Then he tried to gaslight you when you pointed out that you weren't okay with that. Your boyfriend also owes you an apology, in my opinion.\n\nIt doesn't matter if you're okay being called that by your friends, because you're absolutely right that it's different depending on who says it.", "NTA; these two bro\u2019s can live together and call each other that.", "Nta. Victor might have been joking and might have genuinely thought that it was okay. However the minute you said you didn't like being called a bitch by him Victor should have apologized and that would have been the end of it. It was Victor's refusal to see he had done anything wrong and Mike's refusal to stand with you that caused the problem. Both of them need to apologize.", "NTA - you stood up for yourself and made it clear it was a problem. Your boyfriend then failed to support you being respected in your own house. \n\nWhat your friends call you is your business and not relevant. If you felt disrespected by the way Victor said it, then you are right to call him out and escalate to\nasking them both to leave if your man fails to have your back. \n\nThey both owe you an apology. Especially the boyfriend for failing in the moment to interrupt disrespect and then for gaslighting you to think it was somehow your fault.", "Ruuuuuuuuuuuuuuun\n\nNTA. Judge people by their friends.", "NTA and you need to leave his ass", "NTA - You clearly and seemingly politely stated your feelings , all he had to do was apologise and move one. He made a scene not you.", "NTA and dump that BF too that's a heinous attitude to basically agree with his friend and not tell him to cut it out", "NTA. I'm not sure if I'd ever be comfortable with a man calling me bitch. Don't let your bf gaslight you. You were doing the friend a favor by passing a beer and he calls you a bitch in your own home? Bf should have your back not invalidate you.", "NTA for being uncomfortable. If he doesn't know you that well, he doesn't have a right to call you that. Even if he did know you well, calling you a name you aren't happy with isn't acceptable. Your friends know you and know you're fine with it. Your BF should have told him to not call you something that makes you uncomfortable from someone you don't know that well, regardless of whether he meant it jokingly or not. Kicking him out after he was told to not call you that and after your boyfriend sided with him isn't unreasonable.", "NTA. Even if you let friends say that to you, you're not that familiar with your boyfriend's friend. Both of their over-the-top reactions to simply being told that you were uncomfortable with it is further proof that it's not a term of endearment for them. Misunderstandings like that will happen in social settings, it's easy for them to say \"oh, sorry, my bad\" and move on. But doubling down and having such a persecution complex is proof that you're in the right to be uncomfortable with it.", "NTA and don't let his victim playing make you think you are. This is who he is.. pay attention. This is what you're in for.", "The way VictorLucas escalated this is what stands out to me. He could have just said hey I was joking; sorry; won\u2019t do it again, but the sudden defensiveness, the saying you got SJW-y just because you don\u2019t want to be called a bitch? You are NTA, and your boyfriend taking his friends side would have me thinking a LOT about where things are going in this relationship.", "NTA at all! Your boyfriend cares more about his friend\u2019s feelings and his own image to his friend than he does yours. Tough pill to swallow but better to learn it now than years down the line. Respect yourself and don\u2019t tolerate such nonsense. No one gets to tell you how to feel about something. It\u2019s not a joke if you\u2019re not laughing.", "NTA, Victor called you something you don\u2019t want to be called and when you told him you don\u2019t like it he got super defensive, Victor is the a**hole", "Take your time now and think how many times your bf isn\u2019t defending you against his friends.", "NTA - dump the bf now.", "I would have told dear friend his mother is a bitch. You don't call me a bitch in my own home. You don't deserve this clown and you don't deserve his friend. NTA.", "NTA - I\u2019d be pissed too. That was rude and misogynistic. Context and the people involved matter.", "How much do you want to bet that Victor uses the \"Are you going to call me sexist\" and \"You can't say anything these days\" for all kinds of offensive shit and gets away with it because he turns it around on the person who is (rightly) offended. There is no way he's fighting back this hard if it was a one time mistake. I bet you he says lots of nasty stuff.", "NTA if my boyfriends friend called me a bitch (in any manor joking or serious) i would expect him to instantly defend my honor and if he didn\u2019t I would feel uncomfortable and disrespected and I would tell them both to leave. It doesn\u2019t matter what your female friends call you his friends should NEVER feel comfortable calling you a bitch", "NTA, but Victor and your boyfriend are pretty terrible", "You are not being dramatic.\nYou are not wrong.\nYou are NTA.\n\nI have friends that we do joke around calling each other bitch. We KNOW it's said in jest because we know each other. If their husbands called us bitch it would be a very big mistake and they might feel that mistake right quick.\n\nThis guy does not enjoy that level of friendship with you.  Your boyfriend should have defended you. They are both gaslighting you.\n\nEDIT: spelling", "Maybe you could\u2019ve said \u201c that\u2019s okay fvcking a$$hole\u201d.

Or Lucas, lol anyhow, if he's been in the vicinity when you have friends over that call you bitch, ESH. If not, nta.", "I was going with NTA until you admitted that you let your friends call you that same name and it\u2019s okay.  \n\nSo YTA because you have different standards for friends and not friends.  It\u2019s either a derogatory term or it\u2019s a term of endearment and while I don\u2019t think any man should say it to a woman, if they\u2019re hearing you allow you being called it by your friends, in their minds, it must be okay to use it with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your BF also has all the classic excuses of an enabler. \"Victor was joking\", \"he means no harm\", \"you're oversensitive\", \"you're melodramatic\", \"How can you react like this over a joke\" are all excuses made by bullies to shift the guilt on to the victim. Ignore them.\n\nWhile you are at it, you really need to have a serious conversation with your BF and give him once chance to explain himself. The only acceptable explanation in this case is an apology that goes \"I messed up. I'm sorry and I won't repeat it\".

That's ludicrous to say that you're acting \"SJW-y\" for defending yourself when your bf doesn't have the balls to stand up for you. It's probably because he has known Viktor for a long time and they've normalized calling women bitches casually.

My advice is to breakup with him immediately, but I don't know your situation or how your BF is outside the example.
