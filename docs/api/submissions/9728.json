We had them every weekend and we built a great relationship, or so I thought. I never tried to be a parent, never disciplined or told them what to do and left all that to Dad. They became involved in my family events, I arranged days outs/staycations and bought all their birthday/Christmas gifts. I helped with homework and cooked all their favourite meals. When I unexpectedly came into a little money, I took them to Disneyland. I don\u2019t know what more I could have done. \n\nPeriodically over the years, the girls would refuse to come to us and we were never told why but their Mum said we just had to \u2018respect their feelings\u2019. We never got to the bottom of it but they always came back round for a birthday/holiday or when their mum needed a \u2018break\u2019. After 5 years out of the blue, their Mum said they aren\u2019t coming round because they don\u2019t like me, they never have, I treat their Dad badly and they don\u2019t want to see it. Apparently we argue all the time and I expect their Dad to do all the housework and childcare for our 3 young boys. I was floored. This is just the opposite of our family life. My husband and I are a team, we NEVER argue in front of the kids as my stepchildren were pretty traumatised by the arguing they saw when their parents were together and it was the first rule of our house to never be like that and to protect them from any disagreements. No criticism on my husband but I also do 99% of the housework and cooking. Their Mum said we couldn\u2019t discuss any of this with them and we stupidly listened. Funnily enough they didn\u2019t mind being around me to come on my family\u2019s two week vacation abroad and they came to that having not seen us for 3 months. I was so hurt but pushed it to the side and focused on having a great holiday with them and my wider family couldn\u2019t have been more inclusive. But I\u2019ve been walking on eggshells ever since. \n\nNow my husband needs to travel abroad for work and we decided to join him and make a holiday of it as my parents live there but we aren\u2019t taking my stepchildren. We would if we could but the flights are three times the price during school holidays and I just want my parents to be able to spend some quality time with their grandchildren. It\u2019s the first time we have ever gone away without my stepchildren (we even did a family holiday instead of a honeymoon) buts it\u2019s taken me three years to save up for the flights and it would realistically take several more if we were taking them too. I have felt really bad about it because I don\u2019t want them to feel excluded but surely it\u2019s okay for me to do something for my children just this once? I\u2019m honestly tired of making sacrifices for them when they speak behind my back and make me out to be something I\u2019m not. It\u2019s made the family life we worked so hard to create feel like a lie and tainted so many memories.

You should read up on it but often if children are rewarded for disliking a parent (generally a parent with less awarded custodial time) by the parent with narcissistic personality disorder or another type of behavior it perpetuates a cycle where the mother withholds love and safety and basic human needs until the children show allegiance and that creates a dynamic where the children are not allowed to like their dad or his new wife.

We hadn\u2019t seen them for 3 months and about a week before the holiday their Mum messaged to let us know they still wanted to come on the holiday but said they would only come if we promised not to question them on any of the comments they apparently made and so we just pushed it to the side and saw the holiday as an opportunity to remind them how great our family is. It\u2019s all been ok since then, although admittedly I\u2019ve just been bending over backwards to please them and trying to convince them to like me again! My husband and his ex argued earlier in the week as he told her about our upcoming trip and said he\u2019d be explaining it to the girls this weekend and funnily enough they apparently decided not to come again. My husband has said the next time they are here, whenever that might, he is going to have a very frank conversation with them and address everything their mum has been saying over the last few months.

She\u2019s always held all the cards because she just withholds the girls if my husband ever disagrees with her about something so he became afraid to speak up. They\u2019ve repeated a few comments from their Mum over the years so it\u2019s very apparent how much she dislikes me! I was 22 when we got together and she told them I was too young to drive and called me his young bimbo \ud83d\ude02", "She's reacting to the other children being treated differently from them. I'm assuming when she goes to vacation without them, she's not bringing other children with her, correct?", "I have a feeling the mother is doing parental alienation which is why she said \"don't talk to them about this\" because you might be able to set them straight about everything and she doesn't want that.

You can\u2019t just give up on them or your relationship with them it\u2019s gotta be hurting them too. How old are they?", "Perhaps you could try this approach.  If you or your husband speaks to the girls be kind, but matter of fact, and state that their mom let it be known that they don\u2019t care to spend time with you.  While that news was deeply disappointing you don\u2019t want to make them uncomfortable spending time with you especially during a holiday.  \nOnce again, you\u2019re not chastising them for their behavior.  Face it.  Their mother started this false narrative about their relationship with you and them believing it has consequences.

Enjoy yourself and maybe while your parents watch your three boys you and your hubby and do some research and come up with a game plan. Maybe go to court for the girls it\u2019s likely they\u2019re being abused if they are having parental alienation this bad where reality is so warped.", "And as unfortunate as it is in these cases sometimes there\u2019s nothing you can do but holding love in your heart for them is best, I know it\u2019s hard not to resent them but imagine living in a world where you aren\u2019t allowed to love your dad or you get emotionally wrecked by your mom. Imaging having a loving family with a lovely fun new step mom and three brothers you adore and being told if you love them you\u2019re betraying your mom. It\u2019s a terrible thing to do but it sounds like the mom has no problem doing it. And she wore those girls down until they broke.", "Let your house be a small getaway for them.

I doubt it as she doesn\u2019t think being a stepparent is a thing.", "What is your problem?! Was my husband supposed to be alone forever, not have any more children and just sit alone waiting for his kids to come round when their Mum allowed it, when it suited her? I\u2019m not sure what part of my post has got your back up but you are very much in the minority here. I have done my very best for his children and we have put up with so much from their mother, desperately trying to keep the peace just to be able to see them.", "Thank you for your message. I desperately want the girls to be a part of this family. I don\u2019t ever want to come between them and their Dad. Their Mum actually said when we first started dating that I was so young (22) there\u2019s no way I would stay and put up with all the drama she was causing. But we are 7 years down the line, married with three of our own boys and all I want is for the girls to know how hard their dad has fought to be involved and what he\u2019s put up with behind the scenes (so much abuse) just to try and keep the peace for their sake.", "Thank you so much for this. I\u2019ve been second guessing myself for months wondering what more I could have done. I would have never even considered taking this trip before it all kicked off last summer but now I just think I need to do right by my own children and stop depriving them of experiences in an attempt to keep everything equal. It\u2019s just not possible all the time.", "Oh definitely. Their mum is constantly calling him to complain about them and asks us to take them for a week at a time because she needs a break from them. So we may not see them for a while but we will as soon as she wants some time away from them.", "No they have joint custody but because of my husbands job we only officially have weekends and holidays. Although in reality we\u2019ve got them a lot more over the years. Theoretically she is in breach of the order but they are 12 and 14 so they can hardly be forced to come now.

Annoying it also didn\u2019t cover big events so we never get their birthdays, Christmas mornings etc. We are just at their mum\u2019s whim unfortunately and we\u2019ve always jumped at the chance for any extra time.", "You just seem to be itching to make this woman the \"evil stepmother\".  I've read NOTHING in her post that shows she doesn't care about rhe children or doesn't want to see them. \n\nIf abuse allegations were true, the bio mom wouldn't keep them away only until she needed a break, she would keep them away indefinitely and involve the proper authorities. \n\nThis sounds like a classic case of bio mom weaponizing the children. Poisoning the well,  so to speak. \n\nAlso, of course we only get OPs side. It's her side she's asking about. That's what this sub is for. It's am \"I\" the AH, not are THEY the AH. \n\nWhat other side did you expect her to tell. \n\nWe have to take it at face value and render judgment based on information provided.", "What part of my post makes you think we don\u2019t want to see them? We desperately want to see them. My husband has put up with years of abuse from their Mum just to be able to see them. I\u2019ve had my husband in tears more times than I care to count because he misses his kids so much. Yes we have had more children but I don\u2019t see why we should feel bad for that? Because I\u2019m a step mum I shouldn\u2019t have had my own children? This is the first time we\u2019ve ever done anything without my stepdaughters in 7 years and we are abusive because we are taking one trip without them? Okay!", "So you get to assume the step mother is weaponizing the children but can\u2019t assume the accusations could possibly be true ? Weird", "Nothing indicates in the post either of you really cared. For years they barley saw you or their father and both parties just accepted it. I didn\u2019t say not taking them kid abuse but they have said you and your husband can be abusive towards each other. So at least one party is lying and I tend to believe children when they speak about abuse", "I'm not assuming anything. I'm going by OPs words. \n\nThe children aren't allowed over at OPs home until the bio mom wants a break and uses this against OP and her husband because she knows it hurts them.  \n\nWth are you on?", "The entire first paragraph was about how I tried to build a good relationship with them and the efforts I\u2019ve made. And we haven\u2019t barely seen them! We had every weekend for the first few years and and we split all holidays with their Mum. During lockdown we had them during the week because their mum wanted me to do all their home schooling and she had weekends. My husband and I have categorically never once argued in front of them. We have a wonderful relationship and we hoped we were showing them what a happy, healthy relationship looks like. My husband cares so much about them that he has put up with the toxic and awful behaviour from their Mum for years. On the rare occasion he stands up for himself then they are withheld from him and no, he hasn\u2019t wanted to drag them through court to enforce his time because how would that ever benefit his kids?", "You do realize that the mom is doing this, right? This has nothing to do with those kids. They like you just fine, but the om doesn't like that. It probably is making her feel insecure. So she's either flat out lying to you (and probably telling the kids hat you guys don't want them to visit) or she's filling their heads with lies about you.", "Info: are the girls the ones telling your husband that they don't want to come or is the ex \"relaying\" it to him?", "NTA\n\nBut are you sure the kids are actually the ones saying this? It sounds like the Bio Mom is a lying conniving wench. Why do you believe her? You and your husband have let it go on for too long. \n\nWho knows what this woman has been telling these kids- likely that YOU don't want to see THEM. These poor girls are caught in the middle because you won't enforce the custody agreement.", "NTA - I feel like there is more to the story. let your husband have a relationship with his children. They made it clear they don\u2019t want you in their life. That is fine and there is no reason to bring them on a trip with your parents. Your husband can take them to dinner and other activities in town on his own. Blended families are complicated.", "NTA so let me get this straight, your stepchildren don\u2019t like you but, according to their mother, they should go on vacation with you? Something is amiss.", "NTA, but I would honestly have a family meeting about how they feel and why. Don't make it about your feelings. Make it about them and theirs, and you can also reevaluate boundaries. \"I'm so sorry I didn't know you felt that way. With this new knowledge, I will work to rectify the situation. I won't push myself on you anymore, and will respect your boundaries.\"", "How old are these stepchildren? This seems like a huge mess. Maybe your husband should talk to a family therapist about this. It might help him process his emotions.", "Yikes, this is just dripping with bitterness. Who hurt you?", "Thank you! I hate the evil stepmother rhetoric. You\u2019re a crappy stepmum if you don\u2019t make the effort but when you do you\u2019re overstepping. You honestly can\u2019t win. Their mum called my husband only a couple of weeks ago saying she couldn\u2019t deal with the quote \u2018little bitches\u2019 any longer and insisted he come and get them and then said she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to live with them anymore so we had them for ten days straight while she got the break she needed.", "NTA. Even if you had a perfect relationship, not everyone gets to go all the time if the schedule doesn\u2019t allow it and they have school", "Have you been documenting the times she withheld the girls from their dad? If you have not, start immediately. You will need it when your husband has to take his ex-wife back to court to force her to give him his rightful access to the girls. Always fight for the kids and not let their mom take them away from their dad.", "NTA. But, OP, your husband should be going to court and enforcing his parenting time. He should go to counseling with them and see if THEY are saying these things, or if their mom is making it up. If you learn they feel this way, I would stop taking them to any special/expensive things with you. If they want to do something with their dad, fine, but if they hate you, you shouldn't have to put up with it. If it's their mom lying about how they feel, all of this needs to be documented, his time with the kids shouldn't be left up to their mom's moods, and you guys should make it clear to her that parenting time will not just be when she wants a break or when you're spending money on the kids.", "What exactly did she say about it?", "NTA, but I think you need to talk to a lawyer.", "Not every child gets to go everywhere.", "Maybe husband need to revisit the custody agreement on family court. So ex will be penalized and possibly loose custody if she doesn\u2019t follow it. Husband can\u2019t just sit back and do nothing ex is filling the kids heads will all type of lies so record the \u201ctalk\u201d that husband needs to have with them alone.. he can take them out to lunch or dinner somewhere or you and your kids leave the house and give them that time but you just can\u2019t sit back and complain doing nothing about it.", "speak to the girls about it - make sure that what their mom is saying is true. listen to them without taking offense. explain your feelings without placing blame. maybe see a family counselor.", "ESH Honestly, I feel like if everything was exactly the way u said it was u are either lying or their mom is to make sure they dont visit.  Either way that's on ur husband  to make sure all of his kids are loved and included. Especially, if custody wasn't truly 50-50.", "Just tell her you and hubby will probably be fighting and you don\u2019t want to expose her children to that :eye roll:", "NTA. But it\u2019s concerning the mom is the one saying all of this about the kids not liking you etc. Are they in therapy? Surely if mom was so concerned she\u2019d ask for them to see someone? How old are your stepchildren? Would you consider family therapy in an effort to help your stepchildren sort out how they\u2019re feeling? Are they feeling replaced? Is mom upset because dad has moved on? You are definitely NTA for wanting to go on vacation without them but there needs to be an effort to get the bottom of the larger picture.", "Apparently they dislike me, don\u2019t want to be around me or in my home but we MUST be including them in every single that we do as a family and everything my wider family do too. Apparently my husband should also be taking them away at least once a year, just them without their brothers, too because \u201che should have never had more children and kept them his only priority\u201d as their mum claims to have done. Ludicrous.", "I would NEVER stop my husband having a relationship with his children. About two weeks before we were told how they never liked me by BM, the eldest had messaged me calling me mum for the first time and thanking me for always being there and being someone she can talk to/trust etc. I have always thought maybe their Mum saw this message and that\u2019s what sparked all of this. I have told my husband so many times to just give in and do what their Mum wants - which is basically for him to go round to her house and be involved in activities she has arranged for them (without me or my kids being there) just to be as active in their lives as he possibly can but he\u2019s refused to play it this way. For example, their Mum has said the only way he\u2019ll ever get Christmas morning with them is if he goes to her house to celebrate it with them (leaving me and our boys). I obviously was limited in what I could say in my post but when I say these comments came out of the blue, we were so shocked. It had been 5 years of family time and I love yous and even when they didn\u2019t come to us, there was never any suggestion it was about me until 5 years in. We\u2019ve never had a cross word or anything because I\u2019ve never tried to parent and just focused on being almost a friend. I\u2019m from a blended family and they can be amazing and wonderful but being a stepmum, kinda sucks to be honest. It\u2019s constantly putting someone else\u2019s children before yourself and your own children and my experience, its having someone who hates you (their mum) dictate every aspect of my life - where I can live, holiday, my finances etc. Regardless of all this, I do love those girls and I hope they never have to experience being a step mum.", "Always ex relaying", "We definitely have. I know it sounds ridiculous but my husband hates confrontation and has done everything he can to keep the peace. But I think this is the final straw. He has said the girls are finally old enough now for an adult conversation and for them to hear his side of the story. Whenever they next come round, he will be laying it all out (without openly criticising their mum of course) and hopefully getting to the bottom of all this.", "This is exactly what we hoped to do this weekend. I was going to let my husband do all the talking really and just chip in at the end to address the comments made specifically about me and just reiterate to them the last thing I want is to come between them and their Dad and regardless I love them and just want them to be happy. We will do this whenever we next see them, I just fear it will be a while now.", "Thankfully we\u2019ve got years of emails from their Mum saying they won\u2019t be coming and she\u2019s listening to them and respecting their wishes - even when they were as young as 8.", "My husband has always done his best. It\u2019s obviously impossible in these posts to share years of history but when I say these comments came out of the blue that\u2019s exactly what happened. I\u2019ve never once had a cross word with either of the girls. They\u2019ve always been super affectionate with me, especially the younger one. They\u2019ve always said they love me and always been amazing with their brothers, really doting on them and it\u2019s been a joy for me to see how much they love them. I know it sounds stupid but we were honesty so proud of our family life and it had been years since they\u2019d not come to see us, we\u2019d actually been getting them more and more, especially during lockdown. Not sure where you are in the world but in the UK Dads never get 50/50 and my husbands job wouldn\u2019t have allowed for it anyway due to long hours and a long commute. His ex always said she would prefer he just not see them and give her more money. She even suggested he move back abroad where he could earn more and he\u2019d provide a better life for the girls and her \ud83d\ude2c", "Love this response!", "Then that's all I needed to know.\n\nShe's telling you one thing and then telling your girls something else, setting you guys up for failure and parental alienation. You need to have your husband speak to the girls directly, without the ex around. The truth is being denied to you and the girls.", "Ok here's the thing, I don't mean to be, rude but all of your statements about HIS daughters and interactions with them seem involve just you and they shldnt. It doesn't matter if they are affectionate with u, if they continue to see their father fully parent their brothers 7 days a week while they barely get two days, and all interaction in between comes from you, they begin to feel like their father doesn't love them enough to put in effort.   \n\nIt's not about u, and quite honestly the more u interact the less their father does, so the more they feel like he doesn't  love them as much as their brothers.\n\nI mean seriously, if a parent sees some kids 7 days a week and is fully involved in their lives (bc Im sure u make sure ur husband is there for them) and he only sees the other kids 2 days a week hurt feelings follow.  Your HUSBAND needs to do more to make sure his daughters know they are loved. Quite frankly if it comes from you that might make them more upset.  I'm guessing that's why they pulled away. Your HUSBAND need to take his daughters on trip with just them so they can be reassured he truly loves them.  At that age when ur parents are divorced and remarried and such u need that reassurance.  \n\nAnd again I don't want to make u feel bad, but if u take the lead, or they can tell ur taking the lead in making time, then they might feel their father only spends time with them/loves them bc u forced him to, causing more resentment and anger.  Please, its not on u, ur HUSBAND needs to make sure his daughters feel special.  Maybe even taking his daughters somewhere while u take ur sons to visit ur parents.", "This!!!!", "Oh absolutely", "12 and 14 now. My husband has had counselling about the situation and has asked their Mum for the girls to have some counselling too but she has always refused. But I think you\u2019re right, it\u2019s gone on too long and is needed now.", "My mother tried the alienation with my (awesome) step father when they split up. It was hellish but over years it was obvious who the toxic person was. He was always there, even peripherally, and he proved he was there for me over the years no matter what. Kids will hopefully see over time who was unconditionally loving, who was stable,  and who had their best interests at heart. Hang in there, you sound like a wonderful person. My mother died with no one caring, i looked after her, and my dad is still in my life even though they broke up 27 years ago. We are about to watch the UFC fight and drink some beer.", "Thank you so much for this comment. We really hope this is the case and that when they are older they see just a bit of what we were battling against. The thing is, the eldest one is constantly arguing with her Mum, they really clash but I get that it\u2019s their Mum at the end of the day and they aren\u2019t quite old enough to see the whole picture for how it truly is. I just hope one day they realise it was never my husband not making the effort, it was him taking the scraps their Mum offered and never having the power to do more. Hope you had a great evening with your Dad! X", "You really do sound like a lovely person", "I did have a good quick peek at their other comments. Wondered if it\u2019s my husbands ex \ud83d\ude02", "Completely agree I really hope he gets the chance soon. History shows they are normally withheld for 1-3 months and then we are just expected to welcome them back with open arms and not question where they\u2019ve been the entire time."]}
