Your cousin insulted your wife and soon to be born child while you were kind enough to provide food and a place to stay. No one should have to deal with racist comments like that anywhere, let alone in their own home. By sending her away, you showed support for your wife and set a standard for the rest of your family that racism will not be accepted in your life. \n\nIf any of your family members were concerned about her having a place to stay, they could surely drive back for her if she couldn\u2019t find a hotel (you suggested they\u2019d not long left). \n\nI\u2019m honestly shocked so many in your family are taking her side.
