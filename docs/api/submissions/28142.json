{"id": 28142, "submission_id": "16ysaul", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for refusing my sister's offer to pay for the gender reveal scan", "selftext": "Hi all, quick update but a fair bit has happened in the last 24 hours (and it isn't good). First of all, thank you to everyone for your advice, I took it on board. Especially the stuff about setting our boundaries now and not taking anymore manipulation. There was some people questioning the need for a reveal scan, we just thought it would be nice for our first child. I understand that's not for everyone's liking but that's what we want to do. \n\nAnyway, my sister called me on Sunday, I explained that my girlfriend should be allowed to have whomever she wants there. She reiterated the awkwardness of it at the scan, so I suggested a coffee meet up which she said she'd chat to my mum about. My mum turned it down and said it was \"too formal\". In her words, \"I'm sure I'll meet them someday\". She suggested we have two separate scans for each of the family, I turned this down because I thought it was gross. My girlfriend is not a test subject for other people's enjoyment. Then I said we'll book our own and invite who we want or have it just us. She then turned passive aggressive and said \"fine, you do what you want, I've been nothing but supportive and my girlfriend is gonna want her family there for everything\". I said this isn't true, she said she wants both families involved. \n\nKnowing that they'd continue to try and make offers for the scan, I sent them a long message to both of them in a group chat. I've added the screenshots on the insane siblings subreddit which you can see on my profile. And as you can see in the reply from my sister, she attempted to gaslight me into feeling bad. After she said we part ways, I blocked her on everything. I'm not having that kind of influence in my life and certainly not subjecting my girlfriend to it. Especially if they're not going to respect our boundaries.\n\nMy mum called me a short time after and told me my message was condescending, cold and formal and didn't understand why I was \"overreacting about the scan\". Told me to not interrupt. Even a message I sent to her which was among the same lines as the one in the screenshot. I told her it's not just about the scan, it's about her overinvolvement in general. Clearly my sister left details out because she didn't know about my sister wanting to look after the baby every weekend and being insecure about the support from my girlfriend's family. She said we should all meet up to chat. I'm not having them bully me though, if I'm there to chat, I'm having someone in my corner. She said she didn't want us arguing but I said the ball is in my sister's court. My mum is attempting to play peacekeeper and has sided with my sister's erratic behaviour so neither of them I really trust. \n\nAs for the scan, my girlfriend and I have booked our own scan and we're having a reveal party next weekend where everyone is welcome. Although right now, I'm not inviting my mum and sister. \n\nI've explained the situation to my dad and he's disgusted at them. My sister and I have different dads.\n\nEDIT: Sorry I forgot to add, you're right that I should not have apologised to my mum for how I broke the news to her. She often comments on how my dad doesn't come down to see me and it's mostly me going up there. My dad and I do talk and when I go up there, he often wants to pay for everything no questions asked (I don't take this for granted of course, I get rounds of beer in to or chip in for the takeaway). Either way, I'm happy with the relationship my dad and I have. We've had issues in the past, but we move forward.", "created_utc": 1696340589, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16ysaul/update_aita_for_refusing_my_sisters_offer_to_pay/", "score": 204, "replies": ["NTA.\n\nYikes, put mom and sister on a timeout at least.

They are acting like her pregnancy centers around them and they get equal say or to make demands of her body. \n\nIf I were your girlfriend I'd be extremely uncomfortable with your family obsession with my body. I would ban them from all medical appointments. They don't get to decide who she has in the room when her body is being shown in a vulnerable way.

Luckily they know nothing about where the scan is or when it is.", "Thank you. I don't even think the meet up thing is a good idea. They clearly don't see why they've overstepped. So they'd be trying to compromise when I haven't even done anything to ensure a compromise is needed.", "I was curious about what she was going to say I guess. She said she prefers call but since I can articulate better though text or email, I'm happier with that (not for every situation as I'd prefer to call or talk face to face with my girlfriend. But for this, no one can interrupt. All they can do is tell me that setting down my boundaries is \"condescending and degrading\").", "Your baby is not their emotional support animal.  Your girlfriend is going through a series of major medical procedures.  Having a baby is not a spectator sport.\n\nYour mother raised her babies.  It\u2019s your turn to raise yours.\n\nYou are no longer a child who must comply with his parents or siblings demands.  You are an adult and about to be a father, you are entitled to make your own decisions and your family of origin (parents, siblings) feelings or desires are not relevant to your decision making process.\n\nYou and your girlfriend are forming your own little family unit by having this baby.  You and your girlfriend ned to start acting like the adults that you are and enjoying this process between yourselves.  Share your joy with pictures to the family\u2019s of origin later.  This scan or whatever other appointments you have should be about you and your girlfriend bringing a new life into this world.  This is not about them.  If you and your girlfriend allow it to be about your families, you and your child will lose out on being your own little family unit because both families will dictate how you should raise yours child.  This is about you and your girlfriend and supporting each other.\n\nHope this helps.", "Omg I can't relate . I would just do it on my own and put the results on Facebook lol.", "Yeah, I wouldn't entertain the meetup either. Feels like just another opportunity to gaslight/coerce/guilt capitulation from you.", "You're right, we should be a unit for our sake and our child's and possible future children. And we will help them set their own boundaries in the future.", "Yeah I understand that haha. I said to my girlfriend I'm not bothered by who's going. She's happy to share with others, so her mum is going and since my dad is supporting me here, she suggested I bring him along."]}
