Last semester I met someone who we\u2019ll refer to as \u201cPatricia\u201d. \n\nPatricia is on her second year of college and is doing very well, but she is very insecure when it comes to lab work. I didn\u2019t know this last part, sadly, up until I had already committed to be her lab partner. The whole semester I\u2019ve had issues with her because I already know what to do but she stops me from doing it because she is \u201cscared\u201d and I am now very tired of this because we are often behind or we make mistakes because she won\u2019t allow me to step in. She has continuously texted me after class and even called me like at 3am to ask me for lab data that she \u201cdoesn\u2019t have\u201d and I always have to step in then to help her because she\u2019ll literally bombard me with messages. One time, I missed a class and asked her for the material and she just dismissed me telling me that she had her notes on her iPad and couldn\u2019t send me pictures.

I insisted 2 weeks later asking for it and she took another week AFTER THE TEST to send it to me (I had already asked someone else and they sent it right away). \n\nThing is, the semester ends on Friday and tomorrow\u2019s the last day to submit everything lab related and after so many free days she has decided to start bombarding me asking for stuff again. I had already decided to block her everywhere, just not on iMessage and now she\u2019s going at it through there. She has even resorted to text and mention me on a group chat that we have with our professor asking me (and outing me) on sending her the data she needs like she wasn\u2019t there and like she hasn\u2019t literally bombarded me since the beginning of the semester with questions. I am now at a loss cause I don\u2019t know if I should just give in and tell her that I do not have what she needs (cause I don\u2019t) and answer the message on the group chat letting her know I have responded to her private message or just let it be.
