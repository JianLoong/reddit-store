A little over three years ago my sister had an accident in a sport which landed her in a coma. \n\nLayla\u2019s horse is boarded about a 4 hour drive from where I (and most of my family) live. My older brother (Jacob, 29M) and his mom live less than an hour away from the stable. The horse is fully trained and Layla used to compete with him. The arrangement has always been that most of the horse\u2019s expenses would be paid for by Jacob\u2019s mom (our dad isn\u2019t in the picture for any of us) as well as my mom and stepdad. After Layla\u2019s accident, Jacob started contributing financially to the horse\u2019s needs and even started riding him. \n\n\nLast week my parents asked me if we could \u201chave a talk\u201d. When I got to my parents\u2019 house, My best friend and Layla\u2019s longterm boyfriend (Thomas, 21M) was also there and didn\u2019t know why he was called over either. \n\nMy parents pretty bluntly told the both of us that they were going to sell Layla\u2019s horse because it\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll ever wake up again and it\u2019s not reasonable to keep putting money into the animal. \n\nI asked if they\u2019d spoken to Jacob or his mom about this, since they\u2019re the horse\u2019s primary caretakers and put a fair amount of money in as well. My parents said they hadn\u2019t spoken to Jacob or his mom, and they shouldn\u2019t have to because it\u2019s Layla\u2019s horse and they\u2019re her parents. \n\nThomas disagreed with this, and offered to contribute financially to the horse, as well as driving up to take care of him. If and when Layla does wake up, she\u2019s going to want to know her horse is okay. I agreed with Thomas, and put out the same offer. \n\nMy parents told the both of us that we\u2019re not thinking clearly and it\u2019s better for everyone if the horse is just sold. This decision didn\u2019t sit right with me so I called Jacob and asked what he thought about the matter. Jacob wants to keep the horse and so does his mother, and his mom has said that she will fully pay for the horse\u2019s expenses by herself if it comes to it. My parents told Jacob that he just needs to get over it because it\u2019s not his choice, and hung up on him. \n\nOnce the call had ended, my parents said that I was completely wrong for calling Jacob for his opinion, and that they\u2019re disappointed in both Thomas and I for even considering keeping the horse. Both my parents are upset now, they won\u2019t answer my calls and have also seemed to cut contact with Thomas who was like a son to them. \n\nAITA for going against my parents on wanting to sell my sister\u2019s horse and asking my brother his opinion on it?\n____\n\nETA more info, replying to questions in the comments\n\n\nThe horse had nothing to do with Layla\u2019s accident, she was athletic and involved in multiple sports at the time. \n\nAs far as I know, my parents are completely fine with money, though it is possible that they\u2019re just not telling me.\n\nI\u2019m not 100% sure as to who has the legal rights to the horse because we\u2019ve always called him Layla\u2019s and never really talked further about it, but I assume he belongs to my parents. \n\nThomas and I are both in ongoing therapy, therapy was suggested to my mom a lot back when the accident first happened but I don\u2019t think she ever went, and my stepdad refuses to go.\n\nBoth myself and Thomas still regularly go see Layla and spend hours if not the full day with her, the main reason for keeping so much hope is that occasionally there\u2019ll be the slightest movements, yet obviously non-responsive or her heart rate will slightly pick up. My parents don\u2019t go see her very often anymore, but they still ask both of us about how she is. \n\nIdk if it\u2019s relevant but Layla and I are twins, and she had been dating Thomas since she was 13 and he was 14, which explains the extra attachment.\n\nOther people do interact with the horse, he\u2019s properly groomed and those of Layla\u2019s friends who also boarded their horse there, as well as sometimes the owners of the stable will pet him and take him out into the paddock when they bring their own horses out and bring him in again. \n\nLayla has been in the coma for three years.", "created_utc": 1678835867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rf8nz/aita_for_not_wanting_to_sell_my_sisters_horse/", "score": 301, "replies": ["NTA\n\nCan you, Thomas, Jacob, & his mom pool money and buy the horse for Jacob & his mom?

Perhaps the sale of the horse could help offset that. My MIL was in a coma for 4 months and her care still costs a substantial amount 9 years later. There is no full recovery after this, and I do t blame your parents for wanting to lessen the burden on themselves. If Jacob and his mom want to buy the horse that would be the best outcome, but really, this is up to the owners, and they have every right to sell it.

I'm sure prices have not gone down since then.\n\nI understand that the horse has sentimental value to you, but it's simply unreasonable to continue to pay to board a horse that is not being ridden consistently.

Giving the the benefit of the doubt that they're not doing anything suspicious (eg already promised to the sell the horse to someone for personal $$), it would be a good idea for you to talk to the face to face and ask their reasons. If their reasons are valid, such as needing funds for her medical expenses, maybe you and the others can propose something to help that concern. You also need to explain to them that for some, like Thomas, you, Jacob and his mom, the horse is more than just an expense but a symbol of hope, like an emotional support,  that she will recover and would like to hold on to that hope a bit longer\u2014they might overlook this aspect because of the stress you've all been experiencing. \n\nBe kind asking about it; it could also be their odd way of distancing themselves from the pain and grief as they might be in the mindset she's never recovering.", "NTA..

I understand that the situation is sad, but it doesn't mean that OP's parents shouldn't be allowed to sell the horse. You also have no idea about their financial situation. Selling the horse and recouping some funds from it may be necessary for them, especially since they must be paying a lot of medical costs relating to having a daughter in a coma for 3 years!", "They likely paid to buy the horse and thus legally own it. Just because Jacob and his mom have been taking care of the horse financially (and it's not clear from the post that they have paid 100% of the upkeep - just most of it) doesn't make the horse rightfully theirs.

At this point its a case of what is in the horse's interests as well. If she competed on it I'm assuming its a working animal and three years is a long break in a horse's career.

Idk if it\u2019s relevant but Layla and I are twins, and she had been dating Thomas since she was 13 and he was 14, which explains the extra attachment.", "No it\u2019s NAH. There\u2019s a much higher than 0% chance the parents are trying to sell the horse to pay off the daughters medical debt. 3 years in a coma is a long time. OP giving up on the horse is not giving up on your sister. If there is an ah here it is once again American healthcare.", "And if the horse belongs to them? I hardly think the sister would have had enough cash when she was SEVEN to afford it. Their horse, they can sell it.", "3 years in a coma? Odds are she is never waking up.", "He\u2019s an American Paint horse, Layla was always specific that he\u2019s Palomino for some reason. He was used for Eventing when Layla rode him, he seemed especially good at show jumping, but he doesn\u2019t like his saddle as much as other horse\u2019s seem to so he was almost always bareback if they were trail riding.", "Frankly I don\u2019t think it\u2019s just about her riding her horse when she wakes up. It\u2019s more about her asking for the horse, and just seeing the animal.\n\nEven more than that, the horse is a sentimental reminder of OP\u2019s sister if nothing else at all tbh.\n\n> if you can find a good loving home for it\n\nThe horse is loved where it currently is, it\u2019s being ridden, sheltered and taken care of? Plus if OP and his family buy it then they\u2019re spending their own money, there\u2019s nothing AH about that whatsoever.", "I wonder if the parents need money, a horse (especially a fully trained horse, *and* trained in sports/competitions) could get them a pretty penny and that\u2019s why they\u2019re pushing it so hard\u2026 \ud83d\udc40", "Thomas and I are both in ongoing therapy, therapy was suggested to my mom a lot back when the accident first happened but I don\u2019t think she ever went, and my stepdad refuses to go.\n\nBoth myself and Thomas still regularly go see Layla and spend hours if not the full day with her, the main reason for keeping so much hope is that occasionally there\u2019ll be the slightest movements, yet obviously non-responsive or her heart rate will slightly pick up.

Idk if it\u2019s relevant but Layla and I are twins, and she had been dating Thomas since she was 13 and he was 14, which explains the extra attachment.", "Everyone seems to holding out that she\u2019ll wake up, so there\u2019s some denial of the sister\u2019s prognosis. This is complex grief and it\u2019s much more difficult to navigate. And all that\u2019s aside from the difficulty of losing a child/family member.", "Losing a child is a particularly unimaginable ongoing grief and she\u2019s not really gone. Hope can be awful. I\u2019ve lost 2 nephews so I do know about family grief. It\u2019s not over in three years. It\u2019s never over.", "That\u2019s not how grief works, especially in a situation like this.", "If it's a good bred show horse definitely upwards of $10,000", "There's been people who woke up after 10 years of comatose.\n\nUnless she's classified as brain dead, it's possible.", "Plus, if OP\u2019s sister has had the horse since she was 7 and is now 21, that means that the horse is at least 14 years old, but more than likely a little older if they bought the horse when it was already an adult (3+) years old. The older a horse is, the harder it is to find a good home for it simply because horse care is expensive and most people don\u2019t want to put that into an animal that can\u2019t do as much as it used to. Horses can live 30+ years and if they\u2019re able to provide care for it for the rest of its life, I think the horse deserves that. I have a horse that\u2019s 20-25 years old. I can\u2019t ride him and he has to eat expensive food, but I love him to death and I know if I tried to sell him he would most likely end up in the kill pen since he is \u201cuseless\u201d (can\u2019t be ridden). I know this isn\u2019t the case with OP\u2019s sister\u2019s horse, since Jacob is still able to ride him and it sounds like he\u2019s in good shape. As long as they\u2019re willing and able to provide care for this horse, it should stay with the family. \n\nNTA, personally it sounds like the mom just wants to make some extra money by selling him because the horse market is high right now.", "He is prob close to 20 by now and at that age you gotta watch out for kill buyers.  The mom should just let them have the horse if they can afford it and it sounds like they can.", "Taking care of a daughter in a coma can\u2019t be cheap", "This is what I am thinking. This might not just be about covering the current expenses but needing the money now. Care for someone who has been in a coma for more than 3 years is probably not cheap and a good horse depending on the breed can go up for a couple thousand.", "Thomas and I are both in ongoing therapy, therapy was suggested to my mom a lot back when the accident first happened but I don\u2019t think she ever went, and my stepdad refuses to go.\n\nBoth myself and Thomas still regularly go see Layla and spend hours if not the full day with her, the main reason for keeping so much hope is that occasionally there\u2019ll be the slightest movements, yet obviously non-responsive or her heart rate will slightly pick up.

Idk if it\u2019s relevant but Layla and I are twins, and she had been dating Thomas since she was 13 and he was 14, which explains the extra attachment.", "Yeah same! My family owns a beautiful horse who\u2019s about 13 to 14 now. He was abused by his previous owners and has always been a difficult horse to deal with. I used to ride him daily but after Covid he got much worse and it\u2019s hard to put a saddle on him sometimes.\n\nMany people told us to sell him blah blah because he\u2019s difficult to ride but truth is most vets have told us he\u2019s afraid of humans which we figured out. We refuse to sell him and feed him and all that jazz because he\u2019s a part of our family now, and even if we can\u2019t ride him until the very end of his life we will never sell him and take care of him.\n\nYou grow an attachment with the horses, and they deserve love too. I will love my horse until the day either of us die.", "oh 100%, especially in the US. And I get that it can be embarrassing to say you\u2019re having money problems, but the way they\u2019re doing this just makes them seem heartless to everyone else :("]}
