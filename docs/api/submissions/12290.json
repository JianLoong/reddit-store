A little over three years ago my sister had an accident in a sport which landed her in a coma. \n\nLayla\u2019s horse is boarded about a 4 hour drive from where I (and most of my family) live. My older brother (Jacob, 29M) and his mom live less than an hour away from the stable. The horse is fully trained and Layla used to compete with him. The arrangement has always been that most of the horse\u2019s expenses would be paid for by Jacob\u2019s mom (our dad isn\u2019t in the picture for any of us) as well as my mom and stepdad. After Layla\u2019s accident, Jacob started contributing financially to the horse\u2019s needs and even started riding him. \n\n\nLast week my parents asked me if we could \u201chave a talk\u201d. When I got to my parents\u2019 house, My best friend and Layla\u2019s longterm boyfriend (Thomas, 21M) was also there and didn\u2019t know why he was called over either. \n\nMy parents pretty bluntly told the both of us that they were going to sell Layla\u2019s horse because it\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll ever wake up again and it\u2019s not reasonable to keep putting money into the animal. \n\nI asked if they\u2019d spoken to Jacob or his mom about this, since they\u2019re the horse\u2019s primary caretakers and put a fair amount of money in as well. My parents said they hadn\u2019t spoken to Jacob or his mom, and they shouldn\u2019t have to because it\u2019s Layla\u2019s horse and they\u2019re her parents. \n\nThomas disagreed with this, and offered to contribute financially to the horse, as well as driving up to take care of him. If and when Layla does wake up, she\u2019s going to want to know her horse is okay. I agreed with Thomas, and put out the same offer. \n\nMy parents told the both of us that we\u2019re not thinking clearly and it\u2019s better for everyone if the horse is just sold. This decision didn\u2019t sit right with me so I called Jacob and asked what he thought about the matter. Jacob wants to keep the horse and so does his mother, and his mom has said that she will fully pay for the horse\u2019s expenses by herself if it comes to it. My parents told Jacob that he just needs to get over it because it\u2019s not his choice, and hung up on him. \n\nOnce the call had ended, my parents said that I was completely wrong for calling Jacob for his opinion, and that they\u2019re disappointed in both Thomas and I for even considering keeping the horse. Both my parents are upset now, they won\u2019t answer my calls and have also seemed to cut contact with Thomas who was like a son to them. \n\nAITA for going against my parents on wanting to sell my sister\u2019s horse and asking my brother his opinion on it?", "created_utc": 1678835867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rf8nz/aita_for_not_wanting_to_sell_my_sisters_horse/", "score": 71, "replies": ["NTA\n\nCan you, Thomas, Jacob, & his mom pool money and buy the horse for Jacob & his mom? You're all already putting money into the horse's care or willing to do so.", "This is just sad. NTA. It\u2019s unfortunate that you all aren\u2019t pulling together right now.", "NTA everyone involved in caring for this horse needs to be involved. Also it sounds like your parents' issue isn't with the horse but their feelings about your sister's coma. They both need therapy if they aren't already getting it.", "NTA. Your parents are pulling all the classic tricks to make you feel guilty over having a different opinion. Don't fall for it.", "Three years ago? I don\u2019t think this question is really about a horse? Maybe it\u2019s more about realizing that your sister probably won\u2019t come out of her coma. I believe that starting a fight about this horse is just a diversion for you, and could only lead in some bad directions for all concerned.\nI urge you to try to come to an understanding that your parents have control over what happens to their daughter and her things at this point, especially. I also think therapy would be a great idea for you.", "Also, I\u2019m very sorry that you\u2019re having to go through this, it must be very painful.", "NTA why don\u2019t you buy the horse from them and give it to Jacob?", "NAH.\n\nYour sister is unable to ever ride her horse again. Best case scenario, she would need extensive physical and occupational therapy if she comes out of the coma, and she may never be able to- or want to- ride a horse again.\n\nSelling the horse is not giving up on her.  Selling the horse isn't abandoning hope for her or betraying her.\n\nIf Jacob wants to buy the horse, that's probably a good solution.", "NTA - give the horse to the people who are currently taking care of him. It sounds like they will take care of, ride and pay the horse's bills. Your mother not agreeing to this (does she want the sales money??) sounds incredibly selfish. Leave the horse with the people it knows and if there is a chance your sister wakes up, she will still have her horse.", "NTA.   Whose listed as owner on the registration?\nIf your brother and his mom want to keep paying for board,  draw up lease papers  and they lease the horse.\n\nHow long has sister been in a coma?\n\nDepending on where you live, horses are a very expensive hobby", "Can they lease the horse out so he can be ridden and competed on? A full lease would pay for all his expenses. A half lease would pay for half his expenses. It's an option to talk to the barn owner about. (I've been riding for 30+ years)", "NAH. It\u2019s been three years. They\u2019re trying to figure out what to do. The polite thing for them to do would be okay with you all buying the horse. Why won\u2019t they just sell it to Jacob and his mom?", "Have you considered the cost of your sister\u2019s medical bills from being in a coma for YEARS? Perhaps the sale of the horse could help offset that. My MIL was in a coma for 4 months and her care still costs a substantial amount 9 years later. There is no full recovery after this, and I do t blame your parents for wanting to lessen the burden on themselves. If Jacob and his mom want to buy the horse that would be the best outcome, but really, this is up to the owners, and they have every right to sell it. I wouldn\u2019t want to keep a horse that basically killed my child, or at least the child I raised, even if a miracle happens she will not be the same. I\u2019m sorry OP I know that sounds harsh. \n\nSoft YTA because emotions, but it\u2019s totally reasonable to want to sell the horse, especially after 4 years.", "Your sister hasn\u2019t woken up in 3 years?", "NTA. Jacob and his mom put money and time into the horse. Are they having trouble paying medical bills? A well bred, well trained horse can sell for tens of thousands of dollars so I wonder if they are just looking to get some money fast?", "NTA  The best thing to do is buy the horse from your parents. If they refuse to sell to you, which i think is a huge possibility due to their insistence on selling something that costs them nothing and is completely out of sight, get a friend they don't know to buy it for you all. It's almost like they are mad the horse lives while their daughter is in a coma. People do, and think, strange things when grieving", "Do not sell tha horse. Your parents aren't doing anything for the care or upkeep of the horse.  You are definitely NTA in this situation.  \nAnd my heart goes out to you for your sister", "YTA. Just because you guys are helping to pay for maintenance and occasionally riding the horse doesn't give any of you ownership of it. Did you ever think that maybe the medical cost of your sister being in a coma for 3 years is the driving force of your parents wanting to sell the horse.", "YTA - about 20-years ago, boarding a horse in a mid-size town, at a mediocre stable was over $300 a month. That did not include ferrier fees, extra food/supplements, horse blankets, fly deterrent, vet bills etc. The fancier competition stables were easily $500+ a month. I'm sure prices have not gone down since then.\n\nI understand that the horse has sentimental value to you, but it's simply unreasonable to continue to pay to board a horse that is not being ridden consistently. Also, you are not paying, and so, it's simply not your place to have a strong opinion in this matter.", "NTA\n\nAnd I'm pretty sure your parents just want the money they can get from selling the horse.  Tell them if they are that hard up to sell their own belongings.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Giving the the benefit of the doubt that they're not doing anything suspicious (eg already promised to the sell the horse to someone for personal $$), it would be a good idea for you to talk to the face to face and ask their reasons. If their reasons are valid, such as needing funds for her medical expenses, maybe you and the others can propose something to help that concern. You also need to explain to them that for some, like Thomas, you, Jacob and his mom, the horse is more than just an expense but a symbol of hope, like an emotional support,  that she will recover and would like to hold on to that hope a bit longer\u2014they might overlook this aspect because of the stress you've all been experiencing. \n\nBe kind asking about it; it could also be their odd way of distancing themselves from the pain and grief as they might be in the mindset she's never recovering.", "NTA.. They're probably struggling with medical bills from keeping her alive in the hospital... I think... I don't want to sound rude or anything..  They're using the horse as leverage in my opinion. They don't want to face the fact that they'll need to pull the plug if it continues, they'd rather have her alive in the hospital than her horse with them and I get that. However, do what your sister would want. If she wakes up. She'll  have her horse. If not... you will have the horse in memory of her", "That is an excellent suggestion since they've got the space and facilities to keep him.", "I agree - I think there are deeper things at play. I hope that everyone in the family, and Thomas are getting therapy.", "They may need the money to pay for their daughters care, it may not be a selfish money grab", "There are people who want to keep the horse and are willing to pay for it.", "Neither are the parents who paying. Jacob and his mom are financially taking care of the horse.", "Question: How much (closer to $500 or $2,500 or $5,000 or $10,000 or ???) could selling that kind of horse bring in? Obviously that amount would need to be taken into account.", "Then they can purchase the horse from OP's parents. They are not entitled to own the horse simply because they have been paying for its upkeep. Plenty of people pay to lease a horse, just like you would pay to lease a house, but it doesn't mean the owners of the home need to give the house to the renters when they no longer want to keep it.\n\nI think people are conflating grief here with who rightfully owns the horse. I understand that the situation is sad, but it doesn't mean that OP's parents shouldn't be allowed to sell the horse. You also have no idea about their financial situation. Selling the horse and recouping some funds from it may be necessary for them, especially since they must be paying a lot of medical costs relating to having a daughter in a coma for 3 years!", "They likely paid to buy the horse and thus legally own it. Just because Jacob and his mom have been taking care of the horse financially (and it's not clear from the post that they have paid 100% of the upkeep - just most of it) doesn't make the horse rightfully theirs. People lease out horses all of the time and retain ownership.", "Then the parents need to pay Jacob and his mom back for what they put into the horse.", "No, I agree with you on this, that they should pay for the horse. It's just that OP was involved in this and tried to find a way to solve the situation without the horse going to someone else. They should absolutely buy the horse."]}
