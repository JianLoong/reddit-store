A little over three years ago my sister had an accident in a sport which landed her in a coma. \n\nLayla\u2019s horse is boarded about a 4 hour drive from where I (and most of my family) live. My older brother (Jacob, 29M) and his mom live less than an hour away from the stable. The horse is fully trained and Layla used to compete with him. The arrangement has always been that most of the horse\u2019s expenses would be paid for by Jacob\u2019s mom (our dad isn\u2019t in the picture for any of us) as well as my mom and stepdad. After Layla\u2019s accident, Jacob started contributing financially to the horse\u2019s needs and even started riding him. \n\n\nLast week my parents asked me if we could \u201chave a talk\u201d. When I got to my parents\u2019 house, My best friend and Layla\u2019s longterm boyfriend (Thomas, 21M) was also there and didn\u2019t know why he was called over either. \n\nMy parents pretty bluntly told the both of us that they were going to sell Layla\u2019s horse because it\u2019s unlikely that she\u2019ll ever wake up again and it\u2019s not reasonable to keep putting money into the animal. \n\nI asked if they\u2019d spoken to Jacob or his mom about this, since they\u2019re the horse\u2019s primary caretakers and put a fair amount of money in as well. My parents said they hadn\u2019t spoken to Jacob or his mom, and they shouldn\u2019t have to because it\u2019s Layla\u2019s horse and they\u2019re her parents. \n\nThomas disagreed with this, and offered to contribute financially to the horse, as well as driving up to take care of him. If and when Layla does wake up, she\u2019s going to want to know her horse is okay. I agreed with Thomas, and put out the same offer. \n\nMy parents told the both of us that we\u2019re not thinking clearly and it\u2019s better for everyone if the horse is just sold. This decision didn\u2019t sit right with me so I called Jacob and asked what he thought about the matter. Jacob wants to keep the horse and so does his mother, and his mom has said that she will fully pay for the horse\u2019s expenses by herself if it comes to it. My parents told Jacob that he just needs to get over it because it\u2019s not his choice, and hung up on him. \n\nOnce the call had ended, my parents said that I was completely wrong for calling Jacob for his opinion, and that they\u2019re disappointed in both Thomas and I for even considering keeping the horse. Both my parents are upset now, they won\u2019t answer my calls and have also seemed to cut contact with Thomas who was like a son to them. \n\nAITA for going against my parents on wanting to sell my sister\u2019s horse and asking my brother his opinion on it?\n____\n\nETA more info, replying to questions in the comments\n\n\nThe horse had nothing to do with Layla\u2019s accident, she was athletic and involved in multiple sports at the time. \n\nAs far as I know, my parents are completely fine with money, though it is possible that they\u2019re just not telling me.\n\nI\u2019m not 100% sure as to who has the legal rights to the horse because we\u2019ve always called him Layla\u2019s and never really talked further about it, but I assume he belongs to my parents. \n\nThomas and I are both in ongoing therapy, therapy was suggested to my mom a lot back when the accident first happened but I don\u2019t think she ever went, and my stepdad refuses to go.\n\nBoth myself and Thomas still regularly go see Layla and spend hours if not the full day with her, the main reason for keeping so much hope is that occasionally there\u2019ll be the slightest movements, yet obviously non-responsive or her heart rate will slightly pick up. My parents don\u2019t go see her very often anymore, but they still ask both of us about how she is. \n\nIdk if it\u2019s relevant but Layla and I are twins, and she had been dating Thomas since she was 13 and he was 14, which explains the extra attachment.\n\nOther people do interact with the horse, he\u2019s properly groomed and those of Layla\u2019s friends who also boarded their horse there, as well as sometimes the owners of the stable will pet him and take him out into the paddock when they bring their own horses out and bring him in again. \n\nLayla has been in the coma for three years.", "created_utc": 1678835867, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rf8nz/aita_for_not_wanting_to_sell_my_sisters_horse/", "score": 1479, "replies": ["NTA\n\nCan you, Thomas, Jacob, & his mom pool money and buy the horse for Jacob & his mom?

Perhaps the sale of the horse could help offset that. My MIL was in a coma for 4 months and her care still costs a substantial amount 9 years later. There is no full recovery after this, and I do t blame your parents for wanting to lessen the burden on themselves. If Jacob and his mom want to buy the horse that would be the best outcome, but really, this is up to the owners, and they have every right to sell it.

I'm sure prices have not gone down since then.\n\nI understand that the horse has sentimental value to you, but it's simply unreasonable to continue to pay to board a horse that is not being ridden consistently.

Giving the the benefit of the doubt that they're not doing anything suspicious (eg already promised to the sell the horse to someone for personal $$), it would be a good idea for you to talk to the face to face and ask their reasons. If their reasons are valid, such as needing funds for her medical expenses, maybe you and the others can propose something to help that concern. You also need to explain to them that for some, like Thomas, you, Jacob and his mom, the horse is more than just an expense but a symbol of hope, like an emotional support,  that she will recover and would like to hold on to that hope a bit longer\u2014they might overlook this aspect because of the stress you've all been experiencing. \n\nBe kind asking about it; it could also be their odd way of distancing themselves from the pain and grief as they might be in the mindset she's never recovering.", "NTA..

I understand that the situation is sad, but it doesn't mean that OP's parents shouldn't be allowed to sell the horse. You also have no idea about their financial situation. Selling the horse and recouping some funds from it may be necessary for them, especially since they must be paying a lot of medical costs relating to having a daughter in a coma for 3 years!", "They likely paid to buy the horse and thus legally own it. Just because Jacob and his mom have been taking care of the horse financially (and it's not clear from the post that they have paid 100% of the upkeep - just most of it) doesn't make the horse rightfully theirs.

At this point its a case of what is in the horse's interests as well. If she competed on it I'm assuming its a working animal and three years is a long break in a horse's career.

Would turning the equipment off certainly end her life? What have the doctors said about her prognosis? (You don't have to actually answer these, just need you to think about them). I'm a little concerned that your parents may not think that she's there anymore and decide to \"pull the plug\" after 3 years. If the doctors are hopeful and feel there is a good prognosis and that she may come out of it eventually, you may want to look into making sure that the medical POA is away from your parents if you feel they may have given up and just want to turn everything off or stop care (again, care that may  end her life if ceased).

At this point, it has been with your family for 14 years and with any luck, that horse will be relatively close in age to you and your sister and still have a good decade left, but if the horse was already 15 or so at the time of purchase, it might not have many years left and your parents may be looking at the sale as more of an end of life care (if I recall correctly from when I owned a horse some 20 years ago, horses usually only live somewhere around 30-35 years) for the horse. If the horse still has a good decade left, you can still try to buy it off your parents, but also be aware that depending on the length of Layla's coma, the horse may still be gone by the time she wakes if her coma lasts years more (I 'm not wanting to be a \"Debbie Downer\", just trying to play a little bit of a devil's advocate on the numerous possibilities. I really do hope she wakes and recovers quickly for all your family's sakes).", "I train and compete horses for a living. If she's had him since she was 7, he must be older and not have much value.

Perhaps see if y'all can get together and buy the horse. Honestly, if she got the horse when she was 7, and Layla is 21, that is 14 years right there. I assume the horse was at the very least broken when she got it so add another 2 or 3 years for green broke horse, at least. It's not been ridden regularly for 3 years, so a 17/18 year old horse, is getting older. Many breeds that is quite old. So take that into consideration.", "NTA. This sounds so shady to me.

I think op is still hopeful that his sister will wake up and doesn't want to lose that piece of her. Probably because it feels like selling the horse is accepting that is sister will never wake up.  That is understandable. People hold on to different things. Being a twin and that horse being such a big part of her, it is understandable. We wouldn't blink twice if it was her car or her dog or her art, etc. \nThe parents are being reasonable. The horse probably would be better off with an active owner. I understand there are people caring for the horse but that isn't the same care as when the sister was actively riding him. Also horses are expensive and letting it go while it is still worth something is reasonable. Even if his sister woke up from her coma, she's been in one for 3+ years. There is going to be some serious physical therapy needed and we don't know what kind of mental capacity she'll have. It is reasonable to conclude that she may not ride again. \n\nI think the only AH move here is not offering the horse to Thomas and his Mother first. They have paid most the costs of this horse for 3 years. Deciding to sell it without telling them is terrible. I'm pretty sure if they could prove they've been providing care for 3 years they could legally fight for ownership or sue for that investment back. Offering them first dips on the horse would still keep the horse near the sister if she woke up.  She could visit and know how the horse is doing. While I understand the horse may be owned by the parents, Thomas and his mom have financially invested in this horse for 3 years. They had a right to this conversation. \n\nI think the best compromise here would be to sell or give the horse to Thomas, a family member or one of the sister's close friends. The parents could let go of this while op can still have that connection.", "NTA.\nIt sounds as if you have strong arguments for keeping the horse in your family unless your parents are financially desperate.

You are 100% right to stand by this, particularly noting Jacob rides the horse 4-6 days a week. He obvious adores it. The best outcome is for Jacob to buy the horse from your parents (perhaps you can all contribute to the price) or they give it to him.\n\nGiven the horse's age, I can almost guarantee you that your parents will not get a worthwhile price for it. There are more horses than owners. Even if it is well trained, it is too old to have value as a Schoolmaster. I also assume it is either a gelding, so no breeding potential, or a mare, who should not be having her first foal at around age 20.\n\nFurthermore, if that horse IS sold - it has a very high chance of ending up at the doggers, or an abusive home. Speaking from experience of rescuing far, far too many horses that were sold to \"good homes\" and end up in these situations. Ever read Black Beauty? It is a harsh reality for many of these creatures.\n\nA horse is a commitment the same way any other pet is. Jacob loves and cares for this animal, and it's pretty ruthless of your parents to be so petulant about selling it, when it could have a wonderful end of life with Jacob.", "NTA. There are a whole lot of non horse people commenting here. A horse in its late teens is not worth a whole lot and is at a point where it needs to start taking it easy, not get sold. It is appalling that your parents won't sell it to Jacob and his mom to wash their hands of their portion of care if money is their concern. They are probably thinking they can recoup their initial purchase price but that is not realistic. Being ridden 4-6 times a week and cared for by consistent people is the best thing for a horse of that age. That said, a horse does not need to be ridden to be perfectly happy with consistent care. Adoption places have prices under $1,000 for a horse of that age. Talk to the owners of the barn and pool your money with Thomas and Jacob and his mom and have the barn owner get in touch with your folks on behalf of another boarder who wants to \"buy\" the horse from them. Then you can buy it from your folks without them knowing. The barn owner should also be aware of what is happening so they don't get blindsided if your folks try to sell the horse behind your back. The boarding contract may have an additional months board due even if the horse is sold as some barns do that without 30 days notice. The barn owner could also possibly talk some sense into them of the reality of the value of the horse due to age and lack of showing. I have a feeling that it is not the money they care about unless they wrongly think they can recoup the purchase price and more about they have given up hope and are letting go to physical reminders. A living animal should not have to suffer for that though.

In my area, unless this fella is something unique, it\u2019d be anywhere from free to $2k. And $2k is streeeetching it. You could list it, but it probably wouldn\u2019t sell. \n\nHowever\u2026Not wanting to board it anymore\u2026That\u2019s totally legit, economically. The average stable fee in my area is $300+/month. Significantly more if you don\u2019t personally do the maintenance (lunging, grooming, feeding, mucking) yourself. \n\nAnd god forbid the thing gets sick or hurt in any way. Horse vet bills are notoriously SO expensive (and impossibly difficult rehab wise) that it\u2019s easier to kill the horse than fix a broken leg. \n\n\u2026That is a lot of money for people whose kid is in a long term coma.

Yet all those months of progress went away the day she saw me riding my other horse, that day I became a rider in her eyes and was \"one of them\" and she no longer trusted me. We were able to get her onto a property with a childfree couple who were happy to just let her do her own thing while she lived out her days.\n\nThis has been a longer comment than I planned, sorry about that.", "Horses a stupid and younger horses are stupider which is not a good combo with kids \n\nBut really they're more spooky, need more training and kids do not have the experience or concentration for either so it can end up very badly for both horse and rider", "Don't apologise please. That was really interesting to read. I never would have thought that for a horse seeing you as a rider vs the person on two feet feeding it would make such a difference.", "No worries. I was still technically a child myself then, i turned 18 a month after she was officially mine (we first shared a carrot on my birthday) so those first 3 months I was putting in the work on a horse that wasn't even mine but I was also the only one who could do it, i kinda have the \"way\" (don't know how else to describe it) with animals where they usually feel safe with me so the fact that she wouldn't go near me after she saw me riding we knew she was to far gone to be brought back around people hence why we \"retired her\" the way we did.\n\nPeople don't realise that horses are alot like people personality wise and they can hold grudges too.", "The only thing I can add is that it\u2019s concerning that all of the children involved are in therapy and the parents are not.", "Most processed foods have an \"acceptable percentage\" of \"unknown\" material. Your oatmeal it's going to have some squished bugs in it. Just how it goes."]}
