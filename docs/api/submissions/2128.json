My sister totaled her car before I moved into the area. I work from home and only need my car (fully paid off last year) for necessities. I let my sister originally borrow my car from April until the end of summer but due to circumstances it looks like she will need it until the end of the year, if not longer. \n\nI have not driven it since I moved here in April. The car needed an oil change, new tire (slow leak) and front brakes all at once due to my sister putting off all of the maintenance for over two months. AITA for telling her that you can\u2019t borrow something until it\u2019s broken and then expect me to pay for the repairs so that she can continue to drive the car? To be clear, I don\u2019t need my car. I could wait until I had extra money to get everything fixed but since she needed it, I now owe her money for a car she\u2019s had for free for over 6 months while I still pay insurance and everything. Both my brother and sister are making me feel crazy since I think she should pay most of the costs since I haven\u2019t so much as seen my car in 6m. I came up with a compromise of paying for half the breaks and she has to return my car by the end of the year but this still isn\u2019t good enough. I\u2019ve been cut out of the social circle and my sister won\u2019t bring me my car because she paid 650 dollars for all the maintenance and now thinks she\u2019s entitled.

The fucking audacity of your sister is wild. Get that shiz back and tell her the $650 she paid in repairs will be cut even as payment for driving your car for 6 months.", "You're not the asshole, that is just common sense that she should pay for maintenance if she's been the only driver of the car for 6 months. What a nut", "NTA\n\nBut I grew up in the Midwest where, if you borrow something, you return it in better condition than it was when you got it. Borrow a vehicle? You get it tuned up and fill the tank. A tractor? Maybe you end up replacing a tire. \n\nSo to me, she should be paying for all of the repairs AND the insurance. \n\nI\u2019d demand the car back and let her know that if she doesn\u2019t return it, you\u2019ll file it as a stolen vehicle.", "NTA, your sister should pay for damages  as long as she keeps the car.", "NTA\n\nIf she wants to drive it solely for that long, she should pay for the maintenance of the car. Paying for those things does not entitle her to your car. It\u2019s also really shitty of her to think so and shittier for them to cut you out and treat you like the AH for this. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with this situation. \n\nIf she\u2019s refusing to give it back, I would report it as stolen.", "NTA- i was kinda waffeling- but the refusal to return your car after the bare minimum -  that does it. Have her return the car or you can call the cops. Your name is on the title. \n\nHave her start playing your milage if she wants to use it. That can go toward maintenance.", "NTA. Your sister should take care of the repairs if the car was in good shape when she got it. Why would you repair a car and pay insurance on a car she is exclusively using?", "NTA but don\u2019t let her use it anymore. She\u2019s freeloading", "Tell your sister that you need the car  gor work and that shes had enough time to get a replacement.  If she doesn't give it back talk to you brother and parents so they know whats going on and see if they can get it back from your sister.  Let them know that your think of calling the cops if she doesn't.  \n\nNo matter what your sister probably has already dirted you with her friends and maybe your family. \n\nDon't expect her friends to be your friends.  Make your own friends so you don't have to deal with your sister unless you want to", "NTA. You need to get *your* car back and end this arrangement asap. Your sister is not at all entitled to your car and she needs to get her *own* vehicle, because using yours is no longer an option.", "The brake issue is likely as much due to your prior driving as her recent driving. \n\nThe tire? Possibly the same, but I\u2019m leaning towards her. \n\nRoutine oil change? If it fell during the time frame that she\u2019s using the car, that\u2019s on her. She\u2019s the one putting the wear and tear on the vehicle.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an unreasonable request for her to ask about splitting the brake bill, but then again, she\u2019s putting on the mileage while you\u2019re paying for the insurance. \n\nA rental would have cost your sister FAR MORE than $650. She\u2019s out of her mind. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA. Your sister is, and so is your brother. Your sister is exceptionally ungrateful.", "NTA", "NTA but stop lending your car. I also think yes you could help your sister out (just like you did) but never for so long and she would have needed to pay for it. Get your car back and don't let her borrow it again. Maybe for like 2-3 days but that's it (i mean i wouldn't do it at all anymore).", "NTA - you have been letting her use your car. So she should get the repairs done. It's only fair. You're not the one driving it.\n\nIf she doesn't bring back your car then call the cops and report it stolen. It's YOUR car. I understand that you wouldn't \"want to create more problems \" but your brother and sister are the ones being bullies and creating problems. \n\nSeriously what's is wrong with people. Just tell her if she doesn't bring you the car by whatever time, you're going to call the police and report it stolen.\nOr you can do nothing and never see your car again because clearly your siblings run your life and can tell you what you can and can't do with your own things.\nGrow a back bone and stand up for yourself and get YOUR car back.\n\nAlso never let them borrow your car or anything ever again.", "NTA. If it was fine when you stopped driving it then she should be responsible for all maintenance on it once she started using it. Unless she\u2019s on your insurance she is driving illegally. She\u2019s obviously hard on cars and cheap. Don\u2019t let her borrow the car unless she signs a contract saying she\u2019s responsible for all the maintenance and insurance. She\u2019ll drop it like it\u2019s hot.", "NTA.  $650 would only cover a rental car for 2 weeks max.  Doing all the maintenance is the bare minimum.  The mileage will also depreciate the value of the car compared to the miles you would have put on it.", "NTA You are being taken advantage  of massively. Get your car back. Quit being a door mat. Stand up for yourself. This just makes me mad. Your sister is an entitled AH.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

ASAP.  While she's driving that thing under YOUR name you are liable for anything and everything that happens to it.  She wrecked her own.  WHY would you give her the opportunity to wreck yours?

And if she wants to borrow your car, she needs to pay 100% for the repairs, and at least 75% of the insurance. And she needs to bring it by once a month for you to get a look at your property to make sure she's not destroying it. Get a contract that says all this, and that she's responsible for ANY damage.\n\nShe totaled her car... if she didn't get it replaced by insurance, it sounds like either she didn't have insurance, or was at fault... either way those things would never have me handing car keys to someone.", "This, she shod pay for maintenance and repair", "Depending on how someone drives and the terrain it\u2019s probable that the brakes are entirely the sisters issue.
