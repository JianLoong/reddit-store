He\u2019s had years of doing aerials or whatever and is going to forget too, but if you can just keep it down low and say something like \u201cI love watching you move man, but it does my head in! I wish I could still do that, and seeing you do it sometimes reminds me that I\u2019ll never do it again. Do you think you could wind it back a bit around me? Just when you remember?\u201d And then forgive him while he learns new habits with you.   \n\n\nHe doesn\u2019t do it at a part time job I presume, or in a class/tutorial, so he can moderate his habits, but he\u2019s going to take time to form new ones with you. Help him out - offer him a seat (and a drink to sit at) when you catch up, meet in places where aerials are out of place for a while, and create opportunities for him to come and hang in your world in a way that doesn\u2019t include the physical stuff. Maybe even do wheelchair basketball or something and see if he\u2019ll join you at practice in a spare chair and learn how your world works a little - could be a great thing to do together. You\u2019ve been great friends for years, so you should be able to get through this too.", "YWNBTA for asking.\n\n>When u was 16 I was I\u2019m a car accident, now I am stuck in a wheelchair\n\nFirst off, I\u2019m so sorry this happened to you and caused you to be forced to no longer be able to do what you enjoyed.\n\n>Everytime my friend does this, I am reminded of the future that was taken away from me and I am filled with jealousy and envy\n\nIt's understandable to feel this way\n\n>I would like to ask him to be more relaxed around me so I don\u2019t have to constantly be reminded of what he has that I lack.\n\nHowever, you can\u2019t really stop people from doing certain things around you because you can\u2019t do it anymore. You can try but I\u2019m sure you will upset your friend because I don\u2019t doubt that he doesn\u2019t want to stop doing certain things because he is around you and you will get jealous", "Nta. As a former martial artist, it\u2019s fuckin weird to throw random kicks or do flips in the middle of a conversation. But maybe don\u2019t use those exact words. Just tell him your feelings and ask him to not do that unless you\u2019re talking about a topic that pertains to it (ex: look what i learned. I\u2019m going to use this move in the sparring competition. Etc)", "YWBTA if you ask him in those words. Just explain to him exactly what you've told here.\n\n>On the one hand, it has been years since the accident and I have come to terms with my life and am focusing hard on my studies.\n\nI hate to break it to you but you haven't. You haven't come to terms if you still feel those emotions. It's the signal from your body that you haven't. Seek counsel to work on this. It's totally legit to feel all of what you feel but it's your responsibility to handle it.\n\nIt would not be TA to explain to your friend you're struggling and to ask him gently to stop.", "YWBTA. I sympathize with you, but maybe it would be best to have a more gentle approach to talking about this. I am sure that your friend isn\u2019t doing this to upset you and isn\u2019t thinking about how it makes you feel at all. You have expressed your envy and you have every right to be upset about what you have been denied. However, it is obviously not his fault that you\u2019re in this unfortunate situation. Maybe just tell him how you feel and take it from there.", "YWBTA if it\u2019s because your jealous. However, I think it\u2019s really rude of him to interrupt conversations like that. It\u2019s just plain rude and very self centered. I\u2019m a singer but I don\u2019t break out into a song when I\u2019m talking to someone, it\u2019s bad behavior but if it really is because you\u2019re jealous that is something you need to work on.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He is not a mind reader.", "YWBTA even to yourself.\n\nI would look at this as practice at letting go. You can't do it all at once, but with practice of gently acknowledging how you feel then letting it go, you can reach a point where you have accepted your life, can even affirm it, and aren't pained by others having what you no longer have.\n\nIf you try to protect yourself instead and build a fragile shell around this vulnerability, trying to wall yourself off from feeling pain over the loss, you won't ever get over it and will instead be constantly affirming and maintaining your state of vulnerability. It will be a wound you pick at making it worse rather than letting it heal.", "YWNBTA your friend needs to CTFD.", "> \u201cI love watching you move man, but it does my head in!

Thank you so much for this and your other advice.", "Really well said!", "Nice words!", "Great Response to this problem", "> I hate to break it to you but you haven\u2019t.\n\nThis is a hard one for me. I feel like considering how far I\u2019ve come, being able to focus on other things is a big deal for me. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to get over this completely.\n\nI did see a therapist after the accident. We made good progress but now that I\u2019m at college I\u2019m not currently seeing one.\n\nEdit: but thank you for pointing this out to me. I will have to reflect on this.", "Thank you, I appreciate your sympathy. I think if I do approach this with him, I will do it gently as you suggest.", "Good luck mate! I hope it works out for you!", ">I feel like considering how far I\u2019ve come, being able to focus on other things is a big deal for me. \n\nIt is a huge deal and you have come a long way. You absolutely should be proud of the progress you\u2019ve made. Recognising that there is still trauma there that you may need to address with a professional doesn\u2019t tarnish the work you have already done. \n\n>I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever be able to get over this completely. \n\nIt\u2019s completely valid and okay to feel that way. I have diagnosed PTSD from something awful that happened to me 15 years ago. I\u2019m at a point now where I am happy and safe and functional however I know that I will never COMPLETELY get over it. I still go to therapy regularly to keep on top of my mental health but do bump up the frequency of my appts if my usual coping mechanisms aren\u2019t as helpful as usual or when I become more symptomatic than my regular baseline. \n\nBe kind to yourself, OP.", "I know... and I'm so so sorry. \n\nLosing parts or functions of us is a loooong journey to acceptation. We, humans, have the habit to make plans like it's already happened. The fact is, life is messy and when things turns out differently from what we've imagined, it's a loss. Specially on your situation where I can only imagine how you're under the impression you lost a hole life.\n\nYou seem like you made a ton of progress indeed and that's great. You seem to not be dwelling on \"what ifs\" but doing the best you can with what you have. And that's amazing.\n\nBut you need to grieve. As much and for as long  you need. And that's ok. That's OK to feel everything you're feeling including jealousy. It's helathy. What's unhealthy is acting like it's not there, unvalidating your own feelings and lack of communication.\n\nYou seems like an articulate, smart and kind person. I'm sure you're gonna figure this out. It's OK to ask for help. It's OK the be jealous of something you lost and it's also OK to support your friend. It's OK to feel contradictory emotions and it's OK to feel everything above at the same time.\n\nI wish you the best. I hope you're surrounded by understanding and supporting people. I wish you the best. Take care \u2728\ufe0f", "Good luck to you. You have a right to your feelings and while you are trying to move forward, you are still grieving what you had and feel could\u2019ve been. Have you considered counseling or therapy? You should definitely look into it. It\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of and it can make you have a healthier outlook on your new life. I can\u2019t even imagine what you\u2019ve endured.", "All of this^. \n\nAs someone with bagage too, coming to terms that maybe I'll never be completely \"put back\" again it's also part of the journey. It's painfull, but  acceptation is the best gift we can gift ourselves. It also takes time, everyone is different and it's not a linear progression.\n\nAgain OP, wishing you all the best.", "Yes, I was in therapy for a while after the accident (until I left for college, so around 2 years). My therapist helped me through a really tough time, helped me direct my competitiveness towards another outlet, and that is why I would say I have found \u201cpeace.\u201d To an extent, that is.", "I\u2019m happy to hear that you are at a point where you\u2019re in a better place. If there is a point in which you can return, I\u2019m sure it wouldn\u2019t hurt. It seems like you have a nice friendship and I think he\u2019ll be very understanding. I think a true friend would! At times, we all do things which upset our friends and don\u2019t realize it.", "That's a tricky one.  Not sure I understand the friends behavior \ud83e\udd14 I know people with multiple hobbies and health training and I have never had one get up in the middle of a conversation and do a high kick or hop a fence.  My response would have been WTF \ud83d\ude33 was that?  Jealous feelings are part of human nature and we all have them but there seems to be some weird behavior on the friends part.", "YWBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet some therapy instead.", "So I have a little experience with this, a family member was injured and now can not walk. It's a very long and tough road to truly accepting your reality and moving on. And it happens in stages.\n\nYou should be proud of how far you have come, and that is no small feat. But it's a process and a long one. There are things you don't even realize you haven't worked through. Triggers you never even imagined would be triggers. \n\nThis is why ongoing therapy is important. Maybe not constantly, but when these triggers come up, taking some time to talk to a professional and work through them can help emensly. \n\nAnd even then, it's OK to 'miss' certain things from before. What is important is learning how to cope with those feelings and stay mentally healthy. \n\nI do believe your friend could/should tone down the jumping around out of respect to you. But strangers won't afford you that courtesy, so working through it and learning how to handle triggers will help.\n\nGood luck on your journey. You already sound like an amazing young person, handling it with dignity and no small amount of courage.", "Just a headsup, what you described IS showing off.... noone asked for a demonstration and it would annoy the crap out of me tbh. \n  A soft YTA, you're upset which is understandable, but that's not your friends problem. That's yours. You need to come to terms with it", "NTA and I think the Y T A votes are misguided. There are some things that will always hurt no matter how hard you try to come to terms with them, and it\u2019s okay to ask the people close to you help alleviate that pain a little. Disabled people don\u2019t have to be perfect, and asking for more sensitivity on your friend\u2019s part will not hurt him. Wanting to reduce your exposure to painful reminders does not make you controlling or unsupportive, and I\u2019m sure your friend will be happy to oblige.", "Can you get into some wheelchair sports? Fencing is a great one, and you can compete against non-wheelchair bound people as well for competitions etc"]}
