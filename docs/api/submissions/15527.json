It's very lowkey, not very serious at all. Basically we have a teacher as our head and we get songs/are assigned songs and sing every once in a while for our club. Sometimes we sing solos, and other times we sing together as a whole class group, and sometimes we're put into smaller groups.\n\nSome context: I am a woman with a naturally deep voice (contralto). I think I can safely say that I probably have the deepest voice out of all the women in our class. Because of this, I usually sing male parts, as it's much more comfortable for me. For our most recent project, I was paired with a transgender (female to male) classmate, who we'll call Ryan(19M). We are cool with each other, but not quite close friends. Ryan is open about being transgender but is not on any hormones or anything yet, so his voice is still very high-pitched.\n\nAnyways, I was paired up with Ryan, and we were assigned a shortish song with a male part and a female part. The male part is pretty standard, but the female part is pretty high-pitched. It was pretty clear to me that I would do the male part and Ryan would do the female part, as those parts would be very comfortable for both of us to hit (I know my voice, and I've heard Ryan sing so I'm pretty comfortable saying it would be easy for him too).\n\nWhen we were discussing this, though, Ryan came out and said that he wanted to do the male part, and wanted me to do the female part. I told him that was crazy, because I can't hit the high notes of the female part and he couldn't hit the low notes of the male part. He wanted us to try anyways, so we did, and I was right. He really couldn't hit the low notes and I really couldn't hit the high notes so it sounded really bad. At this point I was starting to get a little frustrated. Ryan kept trying to hit the low notes and failing, and then he started to cry and said that he didn't want to do the female part of the song. I got mad and told him that he couldn't always get his way, and that he should be logical and accept that I would be better for the male part and he would be better for the female part. He cried even harder, and we had to stop for the day.\n\nAt the moment I was really mad and frustrated but now that I've had some time to cool off I do feel bad. I didn't want to make him cry, and as someone who isn't transgender I don't know how it feels. But the song would have sounded terrible if we switched parts, and I really think it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. But idk, I feel bad. If I am in the wrong I will apologize to him and figure something out. So AITA?\n\nEdit to address some misconceptions in the comments: \n\n1. In class it was not referred to as a male part and a female part. It was referred to as tenor/contralto and soprano. I did not use those terms in this post as I wasn't sure whether people would understand the technical terms. Ryan was fine with it being referred to as contralto/tenor and soprano, he just wanted me to do the soprano (higher pitched part) and him to do the contralto (lower pitched part) which would not have worked. \n2. The song isn't a romantic song. It's a darker, edgier song, which just happens to have been sang by a a male and a female originally. In fact there's no romance at all even inplied in the song. The lyrics didn't matter to Ryan (he said so) - he just didn't want to sing the part that was originally sung by a woman.

Your issues with the music are all technical so it can be hard to understand how someone can be emotionally distressed by what seems simple to you.\n\n You should suggest that you and Ryan talk to the teacher. If he is having problems with dysphoria, the sound of his own voice at those notes might be causing him distress. Or if it's the lyrics of the song, you guys might be able to just change a few little things and make it work. \n\nStraight Cis people change the lyrics to match their own gender expression on covers all the time. Surely a kinder compromise than, \"just do it.\" Can be found.\n\nEdited NTA to NAH", "NTA there was a task that needed to be done and you were being logical at assigning the best person for the best task. Who cares who had to play the male or female part. It's an act, hell even way back in the day during Shakespeare men played women roles (granted it was only men who acted then) but still it doesn't matter who does what if each person is doing what they would be best at. You did well, hold your ground. Hopefully your partner will learn a life lesson and not act like a child.", "NAH\n\nYou did nothing wrong to suggest that you both do the parts that your voices allow you to sing. And I can understand your frustration at Ryan's difficulty in accepting that.\n\nI also understand that this kind of issue must be deeply upsetting to Ryan as he is navigating transition and dealing with his own feelings and reactions to how he is seen by others. Naturally, he wants to be accepted as male, as is reasonably. But he sees being asked to sing a female part as not being recognised for who he is. Of course, in reality it's not about that at all, it's about your voices. \n\nIf you are contralto and Ryan is still soprano (I'm not sure if that's the right term for high-pitched) that's simply a fact.\n\nIt might be more tactful to describe those parts as contralto and soprano so they are not gendered but I imagine that if they are well known pieces, they are already gendered?", "Show him any music video by The Communards (like Don\u2019t Leave Me This Way). They were notable because the female singer sang the low notes and the male singer sang the high notes. They were good at it too.", "NTA if someone cant be professional about something and have feelings over everything, then you might want to try asking for a different partner. Its impossible to deal with ones who doesn't understand logic.", "NTA\n\nto begin with, your classmate should know the limitations of voice range. trying to force it will not sound good, will just cause everyone to become frustrated and result in a poor performance. \n\nso, if this person actually wants to provide a good performance, then it's a no brainer. \n\nto me, this sounds like fake-macho behaviour.", " NTA\nI\u2019ve had many transgender students doing theatre. While we are respectful to calm them what they\u2019d like and costume them how they are most comfortable, you can\u2019t do anything about vocal range. Sounds like the song didn\u2019t matter about gender other than vocal range. I understand feeling frustrated and you could probably have been more sensitive to him, but that is a reality that your vocal ranges are your ranges.", "NTA - get the  right person for the job", "Idk I'm not transgender either but it's definitely a logical thing to suggest you play the parts your voices are suited for. Maybe he just has ptsd or is struggling because his voice isn't low enough to be the male tones he wants them to be. I don't think you're really the asshole (nta) more that his emotions got the better of him, so maybe an apology anyway to keep the peace and see how he's feeling about the song at the next class.", "NTA - your goal is to perform the song best.\n\nSo is his but - also to avoid any indication that he is NOT a female.\n\nThat's even more important than the performance and feels his gender identity threatened by the female role.\n\nNo easy solution - time to find another partner who will put the performance first.", "NTA- you we\u2019re approaching it from a purely logical standpoint. Who\u2019s voice is best suited for the part.\nRyan has recently embraced his male self, and I think it was difficult for him to play a female part.\nSince it is for fun, can\u2019t you just change the key, so he can play the male and you the female?\nOr find a male part for him? It\u2019s important for him right now.", "NTA - but sounds like the problem is with the labeling of the parts. If they were labeled soprano, alto, etc, then a person sings in their range and its no big deal. You can remind Ryan that once he starts hormone therapy and goes through 2nd puberty, his voice will change.", "NTA. Sing the parts your voices can sing.", "Sounds more like an identity issue, than Ryan trying to get their way. They\u2019ve been stuck in a female role their whole life, so it\u2019s understandable why they don\u2019t want that role now.\n\nLower voices are perceived as more masculine. So not being able to sing a lower role is likely very frustrating and bringing to the surface issues that have nothing to do with this song or performance.\n\nAt the same time it has to be frustrating for OP when the most logical answer is just to flip roles. \n\nMaybe try singing the duet a few different ways and find an arrangement you\u2019re both comfortable with. If this is just for fun, find a way to make it fun for both of you. Throw away the notion of traditional male and female roles. Maybe the high part, with a few lyric changes, can be masculine and same for lower part. \n\nNAH", "NTA I'm not transgender, but my daughter is MtF so I can understand how Ryan would have been feeling.  Passing is so important and to play what is seen as a 'female role' would just mess with the dysphoria they already feel.  Given the situation, if Ryan doesn't want to sing the part which would suit his voice then, maybe, he should take a step back.  I understand asking someone to think logically but it's difficult when emotions come into it.\nPossibly suggesting the idea of a vocal coach might help for future performances.  I hope you guys sort it out.", "NAH.\n\nOn the one hand, you're right. Whoever can sing the part should sing the part. You both even tried it the way he wanted to do it and it didn't work. From a logical standpoint, it is silly. \n\nHOWEVER, things are different when you're trans. You've spent your entire life being told by everybody that you aren't *you*, you're someone else, and on top of that, right now there is a really nasty hatred of trans people that makes being trans exponentially harder and more emotional. So he probably couldn't be totally logical about it in the moment. For him, it wasn't \"who can sing the part the best\" it was once again being told he wasn't who he is and that can really screw you up.\n\nAnd the reason I say NAH is because if you aren't trans or nonbinary, it's probably really hard to understand what it's like. If who you are matches what you see in the mirror and what society tells you is \"good\" and \"normal\" and you have been endlessly validated just for existing all your life, it's probably easy to take that for granted or just not realize how damaging and difficult it is to just exist when it's the total opposite of that.\n\nWhich isn't me saying \"oh well, ignorance is bliss.\" You obviously care about this guy's feeling and want to do right by him, since you're asking and are willing to learn and apologize. \n\nSo NAH.", "NTA.  Ryan doesn't get special treatment due to being trans.  If Ryan's voice isn't suited for a song, then it's not.", "NTA. \n\nCan you speak to the teacher and get a different song assigned--one that is divided differently? \n\nOr can you each be paired with someone else--for example, can you be paired with a soprano who is comfortable singing the part, and Ryan can be paired with someone else on a song that perhaps has a more traditionally male part in a range that he can sing comfortably? There are some great songs for high tenors that he could probably do amazing with.\n\nBut there's no way the song you were assigned is going to work unless he's willing to sing the soprano part.", "NTA. His desire to be male doesn't  change the reity of his voice.  If he wants to do well in class then he needs to sing the soprano  part.  He's  being ridiculous.", "NAH. It sounds like he's going through a lot with body dysphoria, and you got frustrated when you saw what was to you a simple solution. These days soprano parts are associated with women, at least where I'm from, and even tenors have a rep of being \"more feminine\" because of how high they can sing, so this could have contributed to Ryan refusing to sing those parts, even if that better matches his range as of now. Perhaps next time you could discuss this with Ryan and your teacher when both of you have a clear head?", "NAH your voices are what they are but many transgender people feel very uncomfortable in any situation that potentially misgenders them so a little more sensitivity to that would\u2019ve been nice.", "Nta. However sometimes its better to apologize anyway, the interaction probably meant a whole lot more to ryan than it did to you. At the end of the day you were right and you don\u2019t have to be concerned with everyones feelings especially when theres good reason to say what you said.", "NTA. Ryan is aware that there are many extremely famous and well regarded male tenors, isn't he? Also, he may never develop a deeper voice, even with hormone treatment.\n\nI'm sorry for both of you, but you were correct. You take the parts you're naturally suited for, rather than trying to force yourself into a role that doesn't fit.", "NAH. \n\nYou can see it from the technical side and he can see it from the metaphorical side. It sucks to constantly be put in a woman\u2019s place as a trans man, and I\u2019m sure if your voice is deep you\u2019ve had your fair share of rude comments. \n\nIf there\u2019s an asshole here, it\u2019s the instructor for assigning something so clearly divisive and not thinking about the social consequences of making a man sing a woman\u2019s part, even if they\u2019re labeled by voice part and not gender.", "NTA, but lacking in empathy maybe?\n\nProbably a better way to have phrased it.", "NTA, but I would apologize for the outburst. Ryan is probably struggling a lot and while that isn't an excuse it is an explanation for his behavior. Maybe seek out some one who is trans and willing to educate you? Maybe get their advice on how best to proceed?", "I don\u2019t think you should sing the high and Ryan the low, but there\u2019s a lot to likely unpack for Ryan about feeling femme presenting, and it sounds like an issue with not feeling at home in his own body. Have you considered discussing that at all? And have you considered broadening your view on trans people by looking up videos by trans content creators? It\u2019s not mandatory but you might find a new appreciation for the strife that comes with not being cis.", "NTA", "NTA. If you can\u2019t reach the notes it won\u2019t work. Why not suggest going back to the teacher together and asking for a duet done by 2 men that meet the same requirements the teacher is looking for. Im not part of the community. But depending where on the journey your mate is at. Its understandable they may have issues surrounding their former self.", "NTA\nSomeone did not think through the situation with assigning you guys that song.\n\nCan you guys have fun acting the song?  Like come dressed in your actual gender roles but then surprise everyone with switch singing?  Like he can act like he's scrunched everything down there to get the high notes and you can dip down like you're reaching for the low notes.  Then you can just try to have fun with the song.", "NTA, I'm a singer, I know what you mean.  There are plenty of men that sing higher than women.  I'm quite sure he's frustrated because his voice isn't where he wants it, I totally get that.  I wish I could sing Phantom of the Opera, but I'm not a full first soprano and can't nail that ending (I'm a second).  It happens to us all regardless of gender.  Perhaps commiserate with him about how frustrating voices can be to help move forward?", "NAH You're coming at it strictly based on who can sing it best.  It a perfect world, your partner would be able to do the same.  However, their view & feelings are more complex due to being transgender.  Try talking to them again.  Apologize for your tone but not for the belief of the parts your voices were best suited for.", "NAH here except the teacher who (presumably) knows their students' vocal ranges and assigned a trans male teenager a song in which he could only reasonably sing an expressly female part. Holy fucking microaggression. That teacher needs to research songs written for countertenors or songs without gendered parts, or pair your partner with someone with a higher voice than him. Talk to the teacher- they put both of you in an awkward and damaging situation and need to do better.", "NTA\u2026.. I over their BS demands that the world must cater to them and never \u2018offend\u2019 them.", "[removed]", "[deleted]", "Theatre nerd here and I\u2019m desperately trying to think of what duet this could be ? Plz message me the name if you\u2019re comfortable hehe :)", "NTA. There are Tenors and altos. I'm female and an alto.

Can the lyrics be changed if they are gender specific", "NTA", "NTA. The voice can only do what it can do, and your voice is lower for no fault of your own, it\u2019s not something you are intentionally besting him at. There are many males who can hit high notes and low notes, probably even in your class, who would take on the soprano role because you simply don\u2019t have the range to hit those. \nI would suggest attempting the song by keeping the parts but switching the words into the other key. People often adjust a song to a key better suited to them, however I don\u2019t know what song you are working on or wether that would be against your instructors assignment. I believe your best route is to arrange a meeting for all three of you to discuss this, and your limitations. Perhaps your classmate needs to listen to the BeeGee\u2019s and recognize that being able to sing high notes is not gender specific.", "NTA I do understand where Ryan was coming from but what you were doing makes the most sense.

I mean that, for example you, are perfectly okay with singing male parts, because you know you are woman, nobody ever questioned it, and if they did who cares, because you're confident on your truth.\n\nHe, on the other hand, had a lifetime of having to act like a girl, when he would have rather ate a bowl of thumbtacks. You say he's not on hormones, so assuming his gender identity and living it must be pretty new to him. Add to that society's messaging that being trans is not an okay thing to be, and you've got yourself a very vulnerable young man, who gets very upset when his gender identity is questioned or threatened, both of which happened when he was forced to act like a woman again. It must have been a very triggering thing for him, so YTA for not being sensitive to that. But the the biggest AH is whoever assigned the songs for you to sing, the both of you should definitely have a converstion about it.", "Slight YTA. Instead of calling it \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d, why can\u2019t it just be part 1 and part 2 (or A and B). I think the reason Ryan was upset is he\u2019s been forced to live as a female a majority of his life, so now that he\u2019s transitioned and is living his life as a man, being forced back into the female role is triggering for him. I would apologize and see if there\u2019s a different song you can duet on where there\u2019s not such a gendered difference.", "Soft YTA.  Don\u2019t define vocal range by gender.

Ryan however is since he is defining by gender role vs vocal range.", "yta, this person could have been feeling invalidated in their gender identity and you getting mad at them was just downright uncalled for and rude. you could have easily explained in a nice way that it has nothing to do with gender and just how your voices sound when singing. singing parts dont need to be assigned a gender lol.", "I was with you at first but soon as you said he started crying and you got mad, nah I'm sorry YTA. Just the idea of crying at school makes my soul want to shrivel up and die. Nobody cries in class unless they're really going through some shit. And how you're describing it it doesn't sound like it was red eyes and a sniffle either. \n\nI'm a contralto gal too so I get why it would be frustrating but it clearly means a lot to him. You should try to talk to the teacher and see if you could get a different song or figure out a way to make it work. And you should def apologize as well. He is likely dealing with a lot of dysphoria and was embarrassed that his voice wasn't low enough. It's not your fault that he got upset, but getting mad at him for feeling ashamed of himself, yeah, that's the asshole move.", "YTA - he got frustrated and your response was to get mad", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'd be so disappointed that I couldn't experience that day like everyone else. I'd feel like my body disappointed me another day, one of many. Maybe I'd be really upset not because of the activity itself, but because it was another experience to add to the list of why my body isn't allowing me to live the life I hoped I could have. \n\nIt's traumatic in a way that probably seems trivial, so I don't blame OP for being frustrated, however, please don't consider this \"childish\" or that he is overreacting.", "In class they were referred to as contralto/tenor and soprano.

Ryan had no problem with the terms contralto and soprano being used, he just wanted me to do the soprano part and himself to do the contralto part.", "Agree! NAH\n\nRyan\u2019s probably dealing with some dysphoria regarding his voice, and the voice part that he sings. It can be really hard to have to sing the \u201cfemale\u201d part for him, even if it\u2019s not necessarily presented that way. Singing the soprano voice part doesn\u2019t make him any less of a man, but he\u2019s probably struggling with that anyways. \n\nI do think OP could\u2019ve handled it better since Ryan was obviously distressed by the situation and getting mad at him definitely didn\u2019t help, but I can understand that the situation was frustrating. I do think that this is easily resolvable by just sitting down and having an open and honest conversation! Communication is key!", "He's in college, he needs to either sing to his strength or not sing. It's not OP's job to tend to his feelings.   She wasn't harsh but she has every right to be frustrated.", "Here\u2019s a bit of context on the categories:\n\n Contralto is the rarest vocal type for women, as it is the deepest for women. For comparison, that\u2019s just about where the third  deepest category of male singers. Women stop at contralto, men start with soprano, the highest; mezzo soprano, the second; tenor (~contralto), baritone, the most common for men; basses, the deepest male voices; and the combined voice types. \n\nI\u2019m a mezzo soprano, or alto, and I can\u2019t sing contralto notes, but I can sing soprano, because I was taught to sing higher than my natural range from the beginning. Some of my guy friends have been taught to sing lower than their natural range, but it took a lot of practice. \n\nUnless you specifically learn how to sing in higher or lower octaves, you risk damaging your vocal cords. Honestly, The only solution is for the instructor to say that they must choose based on where their voice falls, and if they want to change that they need to learn how to do it properly. Ryan really just needs to be partnered with another soprano, and do soprano-mezzo soprano songs.", "I understand that. I was angry in the moment but I do feel bad.", "Please dont use this as an excuse to be transphobic.", "I agree with your first part, but please don't use this as an excuse to be transphobic.", "He*", "I do feel the need to clarify that I didn't get mad at him for crying/feeling bad. I was frustrated about this obstacle that we weren't able to get past, and he started crying later after unsuccessfully trying to sing the low parts multiple times.", "Your first line is so condescending lol \n\nIf Ryan can't sing low notes...and the song requires the person to sing low notes..I'm sorry but just don't sing them. If you're that sensitive to the fact you can't do something, no matter what the reason or gender identity... then don't put yourself in that position.", "In class it was referred to as contralto/tenor and soprano. I just used the terms male part (to indicate low pitch) and female part (high pitch) on this post because I wasn't sure if people would know the technical terms. I agree with your second part though.", "I think the naming here came from the original song having a male and a female singer in it", "How is OP defining it by gender Ryan who is a male can hit high notes and OP who is a woman can hit low notes its just how it is", "The song had a male singer and a female singer, which is why I called it the male part and female part on here. In class it was referred to as tenor/contralto and soprano. I didn't use those terms on here because I wasn't sure most people knew the technical terms for it.", "I agree with you that I was out of line. But also I do feel the need to clarify that I didn't get mad at him for crying or feeling bad - I was frustrated that we weren't able to move past this, and he started crying after that.", "HIS problems are NOT OPs problems to deal with. OP is there to enjoy what they are doing, not cater to anyones issues.", "You're right! I kind of forgot that was an option, it's been a while since I've seen an NAH verdict \ud83d\ude05", "I agree logic and emotion don't go hand in hand. For me personally I always tend to the logical side of things rather than emotional. I do agree the teacher could have assigned things differently. But with how things were assigned and the events that transpired, IMO OP did nothing wrong. With that being said neither did Ryan, Ryan wanted to try out the part that OP stated wouldn't be good for him but let him anyways. Neither student did anything wrong I think the compromise there was handled well. The only part I don't agree with was Ryan crying afterwards because it didn't work out. As I mentioned in one of my replies I don't believe he cried intentionally to get his way or anything like that. Just for me it didn't seem productive and based on the age range I'm guessing they are felt like it was out of place for the task at hand. I personally don't see any asshole in the picture (op/Ryan/teacher) they also always had the option to request a different piece from the teacher that they would both benefit from but I don't think that was done as it wasn't mentioned. Again the whole thing to me just sounds like a lack of skill for a particular role that Ryan wanted to fulfill. No one did anything wrong it's just not doable with the skill he currently has. Anyone has the right to feel any way that they please, I just feel like crying about it was counterproductive.  The teacher assigned them a piece that they can clearly do, just not the part that one or both wanted to do which is why I'm saying the teacher is NTA. Again with Ryan in the middle of transitioning (I'm guessing) might call for special circumstances but that would be up to the students to speak to the teacher about and ask for those permissions.", "I wouldn't blame you, but I would tell you to have checked the weight limit before you went up.", ">what if I were really excited to go zip gliding, planned a whole day to do so with my partner, but when I got to the top of the mountain and found out I was too heavy to participate, would you feel bad at me for crying?\n\nIf I had pointed out many times that there was a weight limit, only to have you shoot down my proposal for a different activity? In that case I would just shake my head at your crying and I wouldn't feel particularly bad for you at the moment; also I would scoff at you calling the experience \"traumatic\".", "I'm sorry I don't mean to sound rude or insensitive, but at the end of the day it is an act. We all have had roles that we wanted to do but couldn't. It has nothing to do with being male, female, trans or any of that. It's purely skill based. OP wasn't telling their partner they can't do it because of their gender but because of lack of skill. They even let their partner try it out and proved that due to the lack of skill on both their ends it's just not feasible. Now if OP has straight up denied their partner the chance to even attempt it because of gender roles that would be a different story. I get the partner is transitioning and wanting to hit the low notes but at that point in time they just can't. I'm not saying they can never get there but right now they cannot. So acting they way they had after the fact is IMO kind of childish especially after being given the equal opportunity. The partner still can work and develop the skill even take vocal lessons to improve over time and then fill a similar roll in the future.", "I'm super accepting of people doing what they want and being who they want to be. Very much a \"I don't care if it doesn't affect me\" type. That being said, one of the biggest issues I have with \"the trans community\" as I see it from the outside is something I struggle with myself as a disabled combat vet with a TBI - That my problems, real as they are, are just that. My problems. If I have a responsibility, it is still my responsibility even on a bad mental day. \n\nWhat if we were on a job site with a small space we need to access, the ftm would fit while my 6'4 ass wouldn't, and they refuse because it'd make them feel feminine? Sure that sucks but we still need in there and you fit. Same with OP. Seems they handled it sensitively enough, \"there are needs and our skills apply to those needs in this configuration.\" It's perfectly valid for the person in question to have issues, but it's their responsibility to deal with those issues before entering a situation that (IMO) they should have known would involve gender specific shit (especially physically IE voices.) \n\nMy personal general opinion I wouldn't actually apply to somebody specifically so willy nilly is \"if we're agreeing that gender is a fluid spectrum, and agreeing that it's no big deal to live as you like, why is it such an absolute full stop to cross back over for the 5 minutes to sing a song if that's just where your voice falls?\"", "This comparison doesn't work because you aren't also stopping OP from zip gliding. But totally understandable about him suffering. I think in this situation OP is struggling too, not in the same way, but by forcing her to sing something that isn't in her range. That isn't to say the guy was in the wrong either, I'd personally say NAH.\n\nI'm more curious about this project. Like did the teacher assign the part with the vocal ranges already set or let them pick, or what? Does he normally sing outside his vocal range? Because maybe there's a compromise that can be made somewhere.", "For sure I wouldn\u2019t blame you for crying in that situation. However I would blame you for not wanting your partner zip line or guilt tripping them for continuing with the plan because of an issue you likely knew you had before even you got on a mountain. That\u2019s what this person was essentially doing. Especially when we learn the song isn\u2019t even gendered yet he is forcing his partner into an uncomfortable roll because she should be the \u201cwoman\u201d \u2014and I don\u2019t think the analogy holds weight (pun intended).", "Im not sure why you are comparing weight and trans. I mean I have huge issues with my weight and am not trans. And using your analogy, I would have cried not being able to Zipline. I understand what you are saying but it comes across as just throwing in yiu being trans for I guess karma...I don't know. The weight itself would have been enough of an analogy. \n\nOP I can understand the frustration and I think it came out wrong in your frustration. I have done that. The more frustrated or stressed, sometimes your brain sounds out something that sounds great but when it leaves the mouth, it does not sound like it did in your head.  I do think you may need a disclaimer at the very beginning or edit your post to remove the whole male female part and just call it soprano and alto (spelling) to those people who look to be offended about anything, you will prolly get a lot of negative comments by those people who don't read the entire post.", "It is childish and he is overreacting.\n\nIts a role in a song, not a gender identification.  I sang the soprano lines in high school because I had a high voice (I am male) that's just how it works.  If I was with the rest of the tenors my voice would have stood out extremely badly.", "It's because Ryan also thinks of them as male and female parts (same way you describe to it for plebs like me).\n\nFor you, it's trying to sing the song that sounds the best.\n\nFor him, it's a situation where he feels he can't be himself and being pushed.\n\nNAH.", "Ryan probably hates the fact that he can hit those higher notes because it reminds him of before he started transitioning. \n\nThis is a very poor comparison I know, but it\u2019s the best I can think of on short notice: imagine you father wore a large belt that he used to heat you when you were a small child. He undo it and yank it out of the loops with a loud snap every time he was about to hit you. Now any time someone makes this motion it takes you back to that time and you start to panic.\n\nEvery time Ryan is forced to do something that reminds him that he was assigned female at birth he flashes back to having to hide who he was and conform to everyone else\u2019s expectations of who he should have been. It evokes a huge range of emotions. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t think you were trying to be an AH, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going through and we\u2019re just wanting the assignment to go well. Maybe approach Ryan and ask if he would like to try to switch assignments to something with a more gender neutral register that is still within his range.", "You tried switching and it didn\u2019t work. Be mindful that if you start switching things around Ryan\u2019s feelings, you\u2019ll find yourself having to do that every time he\u2019s unhappy about something.", "Forgive me I don't know much about music but is there a way to switch the parts? I don't know the full song or if it has lyrics so it's kinda hard to judge, but pick a random genetic love song. It probably has a part about how the girl smiles and makes them feel, instead of saying girl can you switch it to be boy? Flip the lyrics. It seems like to me it'd help solve it. \n\nI would also recommend talking to him now that you've both calmed down and just have a talk about it. Asking the professor for advice would also be an idea. \n\nI'm going NAH. You are both right and both were not trying to be rude.", "Just apologize to him then.", "I don\u2019t need an excuse", "You're entitled to your opinion lol\n\nThing is, he didn't put himself in this position. The song and partnership was assigned and he had limited options to deal with the situation. \nI don't think the issue was that simply he couldn't do something. \n\nHis gender identity matters precisely because it makes the situation nuanced and complicated, not as clear cut as you make it out to be. By understanding the nuance and emotional background that stems from his gender identity, you would be able to empathize with his struggle, something you are clearly unwilling to do. \n\nHopefully OP won't dismiss it like you do and will be able to start a conversation with him and the person who assignes the songs about how to best navigate this situation.\n\nWho knows, the solution might be that he has to step away eventually (hopefully not though), but I don't think it's reasonable to expect a 19 year old to be perfectly aware of all their boundaries and triggers and be able to fully and assertively express himself when his buttons are pushed, hence the emotional breakdown. And to that, OP's reaction was very insensitive.", "They mean use tenor, alto etc\u2026 Many men can have higher voices and women lower, there are averages, but using female voice/male voice actually isn\u2019t telling us much about the ranges involved. It isn\u2019t useful and that sort of gendered classification of voices is probably in part why Ryan feels so upset over the part allocated.", "you can be any gender and sing any part \ud83d\ude0c", "The teacher clearly set them up for this to happen. This was an unfair assignment", "If you think he cried intentionally, or used his emotions to try to get what he wants, I understand why you consider that childish. What I'm trying to say is that I don't think his crying was intentional. I think it wasn't because he was trying to win the part he wanted. If you've ever cried from a panic attack, being that stressed due to dysphoria kinda feels like that.", "All we're assigned is the song. Usually it's pretty simple who does what part of the song.", "OP is stuck between a rock and a hard place here. The struggle is Ryan's voice does not match their gender identity. He wants to sing the line pitched for a male. Singing the higher line,  even if the lyrics are changed doesn't line up with their identity.\n\nOoh! OP, I don't know if it would help Ryan, but remind him that they used to (and sometimes still do) use prepubescent boys to sing traditional alto / soprano lines. Considering Ryan hasn't started hormones yet, can they consider it like they haven't gone through (second) puberty yet?", "Feeling bad about something doesn't mean an apology is warranted. If there are to be apologies just to smooth things over, Ryan needs to apologize as well.", "No apology needed. She didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She even tried to accommodate him but it didn\u2019t work.", "At some point, suck it up. Everybody is going through something. That\u2019s never a reason to be illogical to the detriment of the performance. I understand Ryan\u2019s struggle, but Ryan also needs to understand the situation.", "I know. The point of what I was saying was that it was referred to as tenor/contralto and soprano in class, which was fine with him, but he wanted to sing the contralto part and for me to sing the soprano part, which is where the problem arose.", "I don't  believe that he intentionally got emotional  either.  He can ruin one class even, but he needs to accept that his voice won't allow him to do the contralto  part.", "I had considered it childish because based on the information I believed he was in highschool/potentially college or university. For which at that point in your life you should be semi capable of dealing with things not going your way. Now if he was in elementary or middle school ok that's a different story. If the person is dealing with a panic attack or something along those lines then again would be a different story, but there is no mention of that here. To be blunt and painfully honest, things in life don't always go our way. It can be due to our gender, background, skills/talents or whatever. We can look in any direction and find something to blame, but there is no point in crying about what we cannot do. If we cannot do something so be it, find the skill required to do it and work on it. You will either gain that skill or learn it is just not meant to be. Some will have it easier than others, now is that fair probably not but it's life and that's just how it is. I know there are things I'm good at and things I'm shit at, I'm ok with that. If there is something I'm shit at and want to do then I'll have to start practicing and learn a new skill. But crying about it won't help me in the slightest and after a certain point in life I shouldn't be crying about things like that. Maybe I'm just old style mentality but I firmly believe in life is tough and we just need to deal with it. Crying gets us nowhere and to make a difference we have to be proactive. In his case it would be to develop a skill he doesn't have. Nothing to do with the person's gender or transition between genders or in this case no mention of panic attacks. Yes I can understand some stress was involved but stress is an everyday part of life especially when it comes to anything skill based. If they can't handle the stress then that isn't the right activity or field for them to be in. It might be brutal to say it but it's sadly the honest truth.", "But like does he normally sing outside his vocal range then? How does he usually do it?\n\nIf possible, I'd try to get reassigned something with two lower range parts so you don't struggle and he doesn't feel uncomfortable.", "Exactly. It should be as simple as the person who can hit certain notes should sing the part.", "my point was that instead of getting angry you could have sympathized. Ryan is trans and it probably felt invalidating to be doing a \u201cfemale\u201d part, even if its in something as little as a song. maybe next time ask them why they are upset and if there is anything you can do to help. you could also try and explain to Ryan how/why you think the different parts sound better on each of your voices. \n\ni just personally think that you took it over the top when you continued to get angry with someone when they were visibly crying and upset. that is a big problem and i think you might need to work on that.", "You're not understanding. There is no male or female really, but Ryan wanted to sing the low part but couldn't due to his vocal cords, which was hurting to him.", "exactly\u2026"]}
