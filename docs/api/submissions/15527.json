It's very lowkey, not very serious at all. Basically we have a teacher as our head and we get songs/are assigned songs and sing every once in a while for our club. Sometimes we sing solos, and other times we sing together as a whole class group, and sometimes we're put into smaller groups.\n\nSome context: I am a woman with a naturally deep voice (contralto). I think I can safely say that I probably have the deepest voice out of all the women in our class. Because of this, I usually sing male parts, as it's much more comfortable for me. For our most recent project, I was paired with a transgender (female to male) classmate, who we'll call Ryan(19M). We are cool with each other, but not quite close friends. Ryan is open about being transgender but is not on any hormones or anything yet, so his voice is still very high-pitched.\n\nAnyways, I was paired up with Ryan, and we were assigned a shortish song with a male part and a female part. The male part is pretty standard, but the female part is pretty high-pitched. It was pretty clear to me that I would do the male part and Ryan would do the female part, as those parts would be very comfortable for both of us to hit (I know my voice, and I've heard Ryan sing so I'm pretty comfortable saying it would be easy for him too).\n\nWhen we were discussing this, though, Ryan came out and said that he wanted to do the male part, and wanted me to do the female part. I told him that was crazy, because I can't hit the high notes of the female part and he couldn't hit the low notes of the male part. He wanted us to try anyways, so we did, and I was right. He really couldn't hit the low notes and I really couldn't hit the high notes so it sounded really bad. At this point I was starting to get a little frustrated. Ryan kept trying to hit the low notes and failing, and then he started to cry and said that he didn't want to do the female part of the song. I got mad and told him that he couldn't always get his way, and that he should be logical and accept that I would be better for the male part and he would be better for the female part. He cried even harder, and we had to stop for the day.\n\nAt the moment I was really mad and frustrated but now that I've had some time to cool off I do feel bad. I didn't want to make him cry, and as someone who isn't transgender I don't know how it feels. But the song would have sounded terrible if we switched parts, and I really think it wouldn't have been that big of a deal. But idk, I feel bad. If I am in the wrong I will apologize to him and figure something out. So AITA?\n\nEdit to address some misconceptions in the comments: \n\n1. In class it was not referred to as a male part and a female part. It was referred to as tenor/contralto and soprano. I did not use those terms in this post as I wasn't sure whether people would understand the technical terms. Ryan was fine with it being referred to as contralto/tenor and soprano, he just wanted me to do the soprano (higher pitched part) and him to do the contralto (lower pitched part) which would not have worked. \n2. The song isn't a romantic song. It's a darker, edgier song, which just happens to have been sang by a a male and a female originally. In fact there's no romance at all even inplied in the song. The lyrics didn't matter to Ryan (he said so) - he just didn't want to sing the part that was originally sung by a woman.

Your issues with the music are all technical so it can be hard to understand how someone can be emotionally distressed by what seems simple to you.\n\n You should suggest that you and Ryan talk to the teacher. If he is having problems with dysphoria, the sound of his own voice at those notes might be causing him distress. Or if it's the lyrics of the song, you guys might be able to just change a few little things and make it work. \n\nStraight Cis people change the lyrics to match their own gender expression on covers all the time. Surely a kinder compromise than, \"just do it.\" Can be found.\n\nEdited NTA to NAH", "NTA there was a task that needed to be done and you were being logical at assigning the best person for the best task. Who cares who had to play the male or female part. It's an act, hell even way back in the day during Shakespeare men played women roles (granted it was only men who acted then) but still it doesn't matter who does what if each person is doing what they would be best at. You did well, hold your ground. Hopefully your partner will learn a life lesson and not act like a child.", "NAH\n\nYou did nothing wrong to suggest that you both do the parts that your voices allow you to sing. And I can understand your frustration at Ryan's difficulty in accepting that.\n\nI also understand that this kind of issue must be deeply upsetting to Ryan as he is navigating transition and dealing with his own feelings and reactions to how he is seen by others. Naturally, he wants to be accepted as male, as is reasonably. But he sees being asked to sing a female part as not being recognised for who he is. Of course, in reality it's not about that at all, it's about your voices. \n\nIf you are contralto and Ryan is still soprano (I'm not sure if that's the right term for high-pitched) that's simply a fact.\n\nIt might be more tactful to describe those parts as contralto and soprano so they are not gendered but I imagine that if they are well known pieces, they are already gendered?", "Show him any music video by The Communards (like Don\u2019t Leave Me This Way). They were notable because the female singer sang the low notes and the male singer sang the high notes. They were good at it too.", "NTA if someone cant be professional about something and have feelings over everything, then you might want to try asking for a different partner. Its impossible to deal with ones who doesn't understand logic.", "NTA\n\nto begin with, your classmate should know the limitations of voice range. trying to force it will not sound good, will just cause everyone to become frustrated and result in a poor performance. \n\nso, if this person actually wants to provide a good performance, then it's a no brainer. \n\nto me, this sounds like fake-macho behaviour.", " NTA\nI\u2019ve had many transgender students doing theatre. While we are respectful to calm them what they\u2019d like and costume them how they are most comfortable, you can\u2019t do anything about vocal range. Sounds like the song didn\u2019t matter about gender other than vocal range. I understand feeling frustrated and you could probably have been more sensitive to him, but that is a reality that your vocal ranges are your ranges.", "NTA - get the  right person for the job", "Idk I'm not transgender either but it's definitely a logical thing to suggest you play the parts your voices are suited for. Maybe he just has ptsd or is struggling because his voice isn't low enough to be the male tones he wants them to be. I don't think you're really the asshole (nta) more that his emotions got the better of him, so maybe an apology anyway to keep the peace and see how he's feeling about the song at the next class.", "NTA - your goal is to perform the song best.\n\nSo is his but - also to avoid any indication that he is NOT a female.\n\nThat's even more important than the performance and feels his gender identity threatened by the female role.\n\nNo easy solution - time to find another partner who will put the performance first.", "NTA- you we\u2019re approaching it from a purely logical standpoint. Who\u2019s voice is best suited for the part.\nRyan has recently embraced his male self, and I think it was difficult for him to play a female part.\nSince it is for fun, can\u2019t you just change the key, so he can play the male and you the female?\nOr find a male part for him? It\u2019s important for him right now.", "NTA - but sounds like the problem is with the labeling of the parts. If they were labeled soprano, alto, etc, then a person sings in their range and its no big deal. You can remind Ryan that once he starts hormone therapy and goes through 2nd puberty, his voice will change.", "NTA. Sing the parts your voices can sing.", "Sounds more like an identity issue, than Ryan trying to get their way. They\u2019ve been stuck in a female role their whole life, so it\u2019s understandable why they don\u2019t want that role now.\n\nLower voices are perceived as more masculine. So not being able to sing a lower role is likely very frustrating and bringing to the surface issues that have nothing to do with this song or performance.\n\nAt the same time it has to be frustrating for OP when the most logical answer is just to flip roles. \n\nMaybe try singing the duet a few different ways and find an arrangement you\u2019re both comfortable with. If this is just for fun, find a way to make it fun for both of you. Throw away the notion of traditional male and female roles. Maybe the high part, with a few lyric changes, can be masculine and same for lower part. \n\nNAH", "NTA I'm not transgender, but my daughter is MtF so I can understand how Ryan would have been feeling.  Passing is so important and to play what is seen as a 'female role' would just mess with the dysphoria they already feel.  Given the situation, if Ryan doesn't want to sing the part which would suit his voice then, maybe, he should take a step back.  I understand asking someone to think logically but it's difficult when emotions come into it.\nPossibly suggesting the idea of a vocal coach might help for future performances.  I hope you guys sort it out.", "NAH.\n\nOn the one hand, you're right. Whoever can sing the part should sing the part. You both even tried it the way he wanted to do it and it didn't work. From a logical standpoint, it is silly. \n\nHOWEVER, things are different when you're trans. You've spent your entire life being told by everybody that you aren't *you*, you're someone else, and on top of that, right now there is a really nasty hatred of trans people that makes being trans exponentially harder and more emotional. So he probably couldn't be totally logical about it in the moment. For him, it wasn't \"who can sing the part the best\" it was once again being told he wasn't who he is and that can really screw you up.\n\nAnd the reason I say NAH is because if you aren't trans or nonbinary, it's probably really hard to understand what it's like. If who you are matches what you see in the mirror and what society tells you is \"good\" and \"normal\" and you have been endlessly validated just for existing all your life, it's probably easy to take that for granted or just not realize how damaging and difficult it is to just exist when it's the total opposite of that.\n\nWhich isn't me saying \"oh well, ignorance is bliss.\" You obviously care about this guy's feeling and want to do right by him, since you're asking and are willing to learn and apologize. \n\nSo NAH.", "NTA.  Ryan doesn't get special treatment due to being trans.  If Ryan's voice isn't suited for a song, then it's not.", "NTA. \n\nCan you speak to the teacher and get a different song assigned--one that is divided differently? \n\nOr can you each be paired with someone else--for example, can you be paired with a soprano who is comfortable singing the part, and Ryan can be paired with someone else on a song that perhaps has a more traditionally male part in a range that he can sing comfortably? There are some great songs for high tenors that he could probably do amazing with.\n\nBut there's no way the song you were assigned is going to work unless he's willing to sing the soprano part.", "NTA. His desire to be male doesn't  change the reity of his voice.  If he wants to do well in class then he needs to sing the soprano  part.  He's  being ridiculous.", "NAH. It sounds like he's going through a lot with body dysphoria, and you got frustrated when you saw what was to you a simple solution. These days soprano parts are associated with women, at least where I'm from, and even tenors have a rep of being \"more feminine\" because of how high they can sing, so this could have contributed to Ryan refusing to sing those parts, even if that better matches his range as of now. Perhaps next time you could discuss this with Ryan and your teacher when both of you have a clear head?", "NAH your voices are what they are but many transgender people feel very uncomfortable in any situation that potentially misgenders them so a little more sensitivity to that would\u2019ve been nice.", "Nta. However sometimes its better to apologize anyway, the interaction probably meant a whole lot more to ryan than it did to you. At the end of the day you were right and you don\u2019t have to be concerned with everyones feelings especially when theres good reason to say what you said.", "NTA. Ryan is aware that there are many extremely famous and well regarded male tenors, isn't he? Also, he may never develop a deeper voice, even with hormone treatment.\n\nI'm sorry for both of you, but you were correct. You take the parts you're naturally suited for, rather than trying to force yourself into a role that doesn't fit.", "NAH. \n\nYou can see it from the technical side and he can see it from the metaphorical side. It sucks to constantly be put in a woman\u2019s place as a trans man, and I\u2019m sure if your voice is deep you\u2019ve had your fair share of rude comments. \n\nIf there\u2019s an asshole here, it\u2019s the instructor for assigning something so clearly divisive and not thinking about the social consequences of making a man sing a woman\u2019s part, even if they\u2019re labeled by voice part and not gender.", "NTA, but lacking in empathy maybe?\n\nProbably a better way to have phrased it.", "NTA, but I would apologize for the outburst. Ryan is probably struggling a lot and while that isn't an excuse it is an explanation for his behavior. Maybe seek out some one who is trans and willing to educate you? Maybe get their advice on how best to proceed?", "I don\u2019t think you should sing the high and Ryan the low, but there\u2019s a lot to likely unpack for Ryan about feeling femme presenting, and it sounds like an issue with not feeling at home in his own body. Have you considered discussing that at all? And have you considered broadening your view on trans people by looking up videos by trans content creators? It\u2019s not mandatory but you might find a new appreciation for the strife that comes with not being cis.", "NTA", "NTA. If you can\u2019t reach the notes it won\u2019t work. Why not suggest going back to the teacher together and asking for a duet done by 2 men that meet the same requirements the teacher is looking for. Im not part of the community. But depending where on the journey your mate is at. Its understandable they may have issues surrounding their former self.", "NTA\nSomeone did not think through the situation with assigning you guys that song.\n\nCan you guys have fun acting the song?  Like come dressed in your actual gender roles but then surprise everyone with switch singing?  Like he can act like he's scrunched everything down there to get the high notes and you can dip down like you're reaching for the low notes.  Then you can just try to have fun with the song.", "NTA, I'm a singer, I know what you mean.  There are plenty of men that sing higher than women.  I'm quite sure he's frustrated because his voice isn't where he wants it, I totally get that.  I wish I could sing Phantom of the Opera, but I'm not a full first soprano and can't nail that ending (I'm a second).  It happens to us all regardless of gender.  Perhaps commiserate with him about how frustrating voices can be to help move forward?", "NAH You're coming at it strictly based on who can sing it best.  It a perfect world, your partner would be able to do the same.  However, their view & feelings are more complex due to being transgender.  Try talking to them again.  Apologize for your tone but not for the belief of the parts your voices were best suited for.", "NAH here except the teacher who (presumably) knows their students' vocal ranges and assigned a trans male teenager a song in which he could only reasonably sing an expressly female part. Holy fucking microaggression. That teacher needs to research songs written for countertenors or songs without gendered parts, or pair your partner with someone with a higher voice than him. Talk to the teacher- they put both of you in an awkward and damaging situation and need to do better.", "NTA\u2026..

The voice can only do what it can do, and your voice is lower for no fault of your own, it\u2019s not something you are intentionally besting him at. There are many males who can hit high notes and low notes, probably even in your class, who would take on the soprano role because you simply don\u2019t have the range to hit those. \nI would suggest attempting the song by keeping the parts but switching the words into the other key. People often adjust a song to a key better suited to them, however I don\u2019t know what song you are working on or wether that would be against your instructors assignment. I believe your best route is to arrange a meeting for all three of you to discuss this, and your limitations. Perhaps your classmate needs to listen to the BeeGee\u2019s and recognize that being able to sing high notes is not gender specific.", "NTA I do understand where Ryan was coming from but what you were doing makes the most sense.

I mean that, for example you, are perfectly okay with singing male parts, because you know you are woman, nobody ever questioned it, and if they did who cares, because you're confident on your truth.\n\nHe, on the other hand, had a lifetime of having to act like a girl, when he would have rather ate a bowl of thumbtacks. You say he's not on hormones, so assuming his gender identity and living it must be pretty new to him. Add to that society's messaging that being trans is not an okay thing to be, and you've got yourself a very vulnerable young man, who gets very upset when his gender identity is questioned or threatened, both of which happened when he was forced to act like a woman again. It must have been a very triggering thing for him, so YTA for not being sensitive to that. But the the biggest AH is whoever assigned the songs for you to sing, the both of you should definitely have a converstion about it.", "Slight YTA. Instead of calling it \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d, why can\u2019t it just be part 1 and part 2 (or A and B). I think the reason Ryan was upset is he\u2019s been forced to live as a female a majority of his life, so now that he\u2019s transitioned and is living his life as a man, being forced back into the female role is triggering for him. I would apologize and see if there\u2019s a different song you can duet on where there\u2019s not such a gendered difference.", "Soft YTA.  Don\u2019t define vocal range by gender.

Ryan however is since he is defining by gender role vs vocal range.", "yta, this person could have been feeling invalidated in their gender identity and you getting mad at them was just downright uncalled for and rude. you could have easily explained in a nice way that it has nothing to do with gender and just how your voices sound when singing. singing parts dont need to be assigned a gender lol.", "I was with you at first but soon as you said he started crying and you got mad, nah I'm sorry YTA. Just the idea of crying at school makes my soul want to shrivel up and die. Nobody cries in class unless they're really going through some shit. And how you're describing it it doesn't sound like it was red eyes and a sniffle either. \n\nI'm a contralto gal too so I get why it would be frustrating but it clearly means a lot to him. You should try to talk to the teacher and see if you could get a different song or figure out a way to make it work. And you should def apologize as well. He is likely dealing with a lot of dysphoria and was embarrassed that his voice wasn't low enough. It's not your fault that he got upset, but getting mad at him for feeling ashamed of himself, yeah, that's the asshole move.", "YTA - he got frustrated and your response was to get mad", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He needs to decide if he is capable of singing with the group even if that means tenor parts instead of bass, or if it is best he drop out for his mental health.

I'd be so disappointed that I couldn't experience that day like everyone else. I'd feel like my body disappointed me another day, one of many.

NAH\n\nRyan\u2019s probably dealing with some dysphoria regarding his voice, and the voice part that he sings. It can be really hard to have to sing the \u201cfemale\u201d part for him, even if it\u2019s not necessarily presented that way. Singing the soprano voice part doesn\u2019t make him any less of a man, but he\u2019s probably struggling with that anyways. \n\nI do think OP could\u2019ve handled it better since Ryan was obviously distressed by the situation and getting mad at him definitely didn\u2019t help, but I can understand that the situation was frustrating. I do think that this is easily resolvable by just sitting down and having an open and honest conversation! Communication is key!", "He's in college, he needs to either sing to his strength or not sing. It's not OP's job to tend to his feelings.   She wasn't harsh but she has every right to be frustrated.", "Here\u2019s a bit of context on the categories:\n\n Contralto is the rarest vocal type for women, as it is the deepest for women. For comparison, that\u2019s just about where the third  deepest category of male singers. Women stop at contralto, men start with soprano, the highest; mezzo soprano, the second; tenor (~contralto), baritone, the most common for men; basses, the deepest male voices; and the combined voice types. \n\nI\u2019m a mezzo soprano, or alto, and I can\u2019t sing contralto notes, but I can sing soprano, because I was taught to sing higher than my natural range from the beginning. Some of my guy friends have been taught to sing lower than their natural range, but it took a lot of practice. \n\nUnless you specifically learn how to sing in higher or lower octaves, you risk damaging your vocal cords. Honestly, The only solution is for the instructor to say that they must choose based on where their voice falls, and if they want to change that they need to learn how to do it properly. Ryan really just needs to be partnered with another soprano, and do soprano-mezzo soprano songs.", "I understand that.

For me personally I always tend to the logical side of things rather than emotional. I do agree the teacher could have assigned things differently. But with how things were assigned and the events that transpired, IMO OP did nothing wrong. With that being said neither did Ryan, Ryan wanted to try out the part that OP stated wouldn't be good for him but let him anyways. Neither student did anything wrong I think the compromise there was handled well. The only part I don't agree with was Ryan crying afterwards because it didn't work out. As I mentioned in one of my replies I don't believe he cried intentionally to get his way or anything like that. Just for me it didn't seem productive and based on the age range I'm guessing they are felt like it was out of place for the task at hand. I personally don't see any asshole in the picture (op/Ryan/teacher) they also always had the option to request a different piece from the teacher that they would both benefit from but I don't think that was done as it wasn't mentioned. Again the whole thing to me just sounds like a lack of skill for a particular role that Ryan wanted to fulfill. No one did anything wrong it's just not doable with the skill he currently has. Anyone has the right to feel any way that they please, I just feel like crying about it was counterproductive.  The teacher assigned them a piece that they can clearly do, just not the part that one or both wanted to do which is why I'm saying the teacher is NTA.

OP wasn't telling their partner they can't do it because of their gender but because of lack of skill. They even let their partner try it out and proved that due to the lack of skill on both their ends it's just not feasible. Now if OP has straight up denied their partner the chance to even attempt it because of gender roles that would be a different story. I get the partner is transitioning and wanting to hit the low notes but at that point in time they just can't. I'm not saying they can never get there but right now they cannot. So acting they way they had after the fact is IMO kind of childish especially after being given the equal opportunity. The partner still can work and develop the skill even take vocal lessons to improve over time and then fill a similar roll in the future.", "I'm super accepting of people doing what they want and being who they want to be.

Sure that sucks but we still need in there and you fit. Same with OP. Seems they handled it sensitively enough, \"there are needs and our skills apply to those needs in this configuration.\" It's perfectly valid for the person in question to have issues, but it's their responsibility to deal with those issues before entering a situation that (IMO) they should have known would involve gender specific shit (especially physically IE voices.) \n\nMy personal general opinion I wouldn't actually apply to somebody specifically so willy nilly is \"if we're agreeing that gender is a fluid spectrum, and agreeing that it's no big deal to live as you like, why is it such an absolute full stop to cross back over for the 5 minutes to sing a song if that's just where your voice falls?\"", "This comparison doesn't work because you aren't also stopping OP from zip gliding.

That isn't to say the guy was in the wrong either, I'd personally say NAH.\n\nI'm more curious about this project. Like did the teacher assign the part with the vocal ranges already set or let them pick, or what? Does he normally sing outside his vocal range?

However I would blame you for not wanting your partner zip line or guilt tripping them for continuing with the plan because of an issue you likely knew you had before even you got on a mountain.

Especially when we learn the song isn\u2019t even gendered yet he is forcing his partner into an uncomfortable roll because she should be the \u201cwoman\u201d \u2014and I don\u2019t think the analogy holds weight (pun intended).", "Im not sure why you are comparing weight and trans. I mean I have huge issues with my weight and am not trans. And using your analogy, I would have cried not being able to Zipline.

The weight itself would have been enough of an analogy. \n\nOP I can understand the frustration and I think it came out wrong in your frustration. I have done that. The more frustrated or stressed, sometimes your brain sounds out something that sounds great but when it leaves the mouth, it does not sound like it did in your head.  I do think you may need a disclaimer at the very beginning or edit your post to remove the whole male female part and just call it soprano and alto (spelling) to those people who look to be offended about anything, you will prolly get a lot of negative comments by those people who don't read the entire post.", "It is childish and he is overreacting.\n\nIts a role in a song, not a gender identification.

He undo it and yank it out of the loops with a loud snap every time he was about to hit you. Now any time someone makes this motion it takes you back to that time and you start to panic.\n\nEvery time Ryan is forced to do something that reminds him that he was assigned female at birth he flashes back to having to hide who he was and conform to everyone else\u2019s expectations of who he should have been. It evokes a huge range of emotions. \n\nI honestly don\u2019t think you were trying to be an AH, it\u2019s just that you don\u2019t know what he\u2019s going through and we\u2019re just wanting the assignment to go well.

I don't know the full song or if it has lyrics so it's kinda hard to judge, but pick a random genetic love song. It probably has a part about how the girl smiles and makes them feel, instead of saying girl can you switch it to be boy? Flip the lyrics.

OP, I don't know if it would help Ryan, but remind him that they used to (and sometimes still do) use prepubescent boys to sing traditional alto / soprano lines.

He can ruin one class even, but he needs to accept that his voice won't allow him to do the contralto  part.", "I had considered it childish because based on the information I believed he was in highschool/potentially college or university. For which at that point in your life you should be semi capable of dealing with things not going your way. Now if he was in elementary or middle school ok that's a different story. If the person is dealing with a panic attack or something along those lines then again would be a different story, but there is no mention of that here. To be blunt and painfully honest, things in life don't always go our way. It can be due to our gender, background, skills/talents or whatever. We can look in any direction and find something to blame, but there is no point in crying about what we cannot do. If we cannot do something so be it, find the skill required to do it and work on it. You will either gain that skill or learn it is just not meant to be. Some will have it easier than others, now is that fair probably not but it's life and that's just how it is. I know there are things I'm good at and things I'm shit at, I'm ok with that. If there is something I'm shit at and want to do then I'll have to start practicing and learn a new skill. But crying about it won't help me in the slightest and after a certain point in life I shouldn't be crying about things like that. Maybe I'm just old style mentality but I firmly believe in life is tough and we just need to deal with it. Crying gets us nowhere and to make a difference we have to be proactive. In his case it would be to develop a skill he doesn't have. Nothing to do with the person's gender or transition between genders or in this case no mention of panic attacks.

I didn\u2019t mean to, but sometimes the emotions are so overwhelming and you can\u2019t keep it in.

So while your suggestion addressed the musical problem, it exacerbated the emotional problem Ryan was trying to work through.\n\nI\u2019m saying \u201csoft YTA\u201d because I understand why you reacted like that. You were there to rehearse a song. You are not Ryan\u2019s therapist, and you don\u2019t have any obligation to help him through his struggle as he transitions. So it was probably frustrating. At the same time, you should have been more sensitive to Ryan\u2019s struggle. His mental/emotional well-being is more important than a music club/class assignment (which you recognize is pretty low key).\n\nAlso, you could have found other cool and creative solutions if you engaged with Ryan\u2019s struggle rather than forcing through what you saw as the only path forward. Like, you could find another arrangement of the song in a different key that matched both of your ranges. Or you could have optioned some parts up/down when they were out of your ranges. Like, it\u2019s music, it\u2019s meant to be flexible and creative. And the fact that you both have unique ranges for your genders make it a pretty ideal situation to experiment with things a bit.\n\nYou seem like a nice person, so I\u2019m not knocking you.

Also, you said that the song was originally sung by a man and a woman, with the \u201cmale\u201d part sang by the man and the \u201cfemale\u201d part sung by the woman. You are a woman with a deep voice, so your talents are more inclined towards the deeper, \u201cmale\u201d parts of the song. \n\nBut for Ryan, this situation is about more than logistics. I imagine him trying over and over again to sing the \u201cmale\u201d parts, and failing. That must of hurt, a lot, and probably caused some gender dysphoria. And being asked to sing the \u201cfemale\u201d part bc (in context, not saying that this is what you think) he\u2019s not \u201cman enough\u201d to sing the part traditionally sung by men. By being forced to sing the \u201cfemale\u201d part, there is an implication that he\u2019s not a real man. No one is going to think you\u2019re less of a woman for singing the \u201cmale\u201d part, but the reverse isn\u2019t true when Ryan has to sing the \u201cfemale\u201d part. \n\n\nI understand wanting to put on a good performance!

I feel like that could be a good resolution to this issue. I do this with songs typically sung by males that I want to try and sing.\n\nI\u2019d have to say a mild YTA. Not because you are wrong for thinking that neither of you are vocally suited for those parts. I\u2019m a soprano, I can\u2019t sing the low alto parts (unless I\u2019m sick haha). But telling him you can\u2019t always get your way certainly was not the way to go about this. He is clearly struggling with the fact that his voice does not match what is typical for his gender, and as a cis-woman I cannot imagine what that is like.

As I've said in other comments, roles in musical theatre/vocal performances are typically assigned based solely on your vocal range and capabilities.  It is not unusual at all for females to sing \"male\" parts or males to sing \"female\" parts as a result, because it's not actually based on male/female, it's based on whether you're a bass, a tenor, an alto, a soprano, etc.  I've known many women who sang the male portions of a song because their voices are lower, and many men who have sung typically female parts because their voices are higher.  In regular, non-singing theatre I myself have played boy parts and there's a long, documented history of men both singing and acting in female roles.\n\nIf Ryan can't handle that then he needs to work on himself before attempting something like theatre, which is already *remarkably* flexible when it comes to gender roles being played by members of the opposite sex.  Plus, in theatre, you don't always get to sing the part you want; it's just a fact of life.  If he wants to continue he's going to have to get a grip and comes to terms with it and not make it everyone else's problem.  That's just the reality of theatre.  If he continued having meltdowns it's just going to make people not want to work with him, and to have the best show, you can't just cater to one person's emotions all the time.", "NTA.

He is in this class and must know that it\u2019s not about gender but by sound. There is no shame in having a higher pitch voice. \n\nSome people are just naturally gifted differently.

I do think that you could have handled it more sincerely though as the way you said what you said was a tad bit too hostile, even if the emotions behind it are valid.\n\nWith that said, we also have to consider that Ryan is likely very triggered by the concept of playing a female presenting role, especially when they themselves are not fem presenting.

I encourage you to be mindful of how upsetting/triggering this might be for them and maybe apologize if you felt that you were too harsh.\n\nAt the end of the day, though, the performance is not about gender but is about each persons individual talents  and if they cannot nail the low notes required of the part that they want, then they shouldn\u2019t get that part, same as no one else would regardless of gender identity.

Just because you're hurt and sad doesn't mean you're not the asshole.\n\nEdit: I am a professional musician who has been in numerous plays. Ryan is not being a team player. It's not abnormal at all for women to sing \"men's\" parts and vice versa, it's about the voice type. It's not a misgendering thing it's a necessity for voices to be put in parts that fit them.

OP, you aren't TA for feeling frustrated with the situation, because it's a frustrating situation.\n\nThat said, and as noted, it's very likely that this is causing Ryan some gender dysphoria. His determination and failure to hit the lower notes was painful enough to drive him to tears *before* you said what you said, and telling him that he can't \"always get his way\" and \"should be logical\" just sort of adds insult to injury. So you're not TA for getting frustrated, but a soft YTA for taking out that frustration on someone who was clearly already feeling pretty vulnerable about the situation.

Falsetto exists.", "Perhaps Ryan could talk to the teacher about the problem (especially if singing the \u2018female\u2019 parts trigger him) and maybe they can get assigned a different song", "If you go down my list of replies the one I most recently made. I had mentioned that while I believe OP to be NTA I also believe that Ryan and the teacher to be NTA as well. Ryan didn't do anything wrong for expressing his feelings. Just feel like crying about it is counterproductive and childish for the age I believe them to be. There are other ways to get the outcome you're looking for, he tried one then started to cry. From the responses I've been getting I've also been learning more, so I'm able to adapt my newer replies as I don't want to alter what I had said in the past comments. But I'll mention it again, as I had recently mentioned in my latest reply when another person had mentioned the teacher could have assigned him a different part. Yes the teacher could have but the teacher already assigned them parts that they could do. While it wasn't the most ideal parts for one/both of them they both had the skill set to sing it. Now if they had both really wanted to try and do something where Ryan could be happy they could have brought it up to the teacher and ask for an exception to sing something that they could both happily do. But from the sounds of the post that wasn't done. Hence why I'm still saying it is a skill based issue. I personally have no issue with anyone who's LGBTQ anyone can be whoever they please. If a person is straight great, if their gay great, bi great, trans great it all doesn't make any difference. At the end of the day a person is still a person a human is a human. Race, gender, sexuality, appearance all means nothing. We're born, we live, we die and the cycle continues. Might not be the most optimistic look on life but that's just how it is, so if I feel like something is counterproductive or childish then it might be but that's just my own opinion. Again there might be something more going on as a couple others had mentioned including yourself. I agree things aren't easy to deal with but it's life we deal with them and move on. I won't ever experience what you or Ryan or the person who walks past me tomorrow will experience or think/feel the way you do. Which is perfectly ok, but at the same time neither will any of you. To be blunt I'm thankful that most of the world won't experience what I've experienced in life. From what I do know from reading the post. OP/Ryan/teacher NTA, do I believe Ryan could of handled the situation better of course. Do I believe OP could of handled it better possibly but OP was already accomodating so OP has a win in my books. The teacher gave them an assignment that they could accomplish and achieve a good grade on, I see nothing wrong done by him/her.\n\nI can understand what you're saying about feeling trapped or boxed in, but again it is a role for an assignment not a way of life that the teacher is pushing on them.

Find some sort of solution.", "I mean, the teacher clearly knew this was gonna happen? Are they transphobic and they want to put him in his place? Ask the teacher for another song or to modify it.

However, I do agree with others that there is probably some other issue going on with their voice not matching what they wish it to sound. If I were OP, I would have the instructor address the issue.\n\nEdit: I am saying NTA because OP is frustrated, and I think that she would be frustrated with ANYONE who was trying to sing a part that wasn't within their voice range.", "Found the transphobe.

It is just two people deciding what parts to sing.  It seems to make sense in this case to sing the parts that match their voices.

But there are men who sing higher parts. Nick Pitera intentionally sings in a voice that sounds very feminine, Chanticleer has countertenors, many male singers use falsetto. Pavarotti was a very famous tenor, Placido Domingo has the HIGHEST tenor range. Being male doesn't mean you can't sing high; plenty of men do. Would Ryan think less of these singers for that?", "NAH why not find another song that will work for both your voices and not cause him gender dysphoria?", "NAH. Might I suggest compromising by meddling with the pitches of the song, like making the tenor part a bit higher and making the soprano bit lower? You'd both be comfortable, it'd sound good and if your class is \"not very serious\" then I don't think anyone will really care.

I understand from your explanation why you did so, but it seems (to me, at least) that his wanting to sing the male part and you the female makes more sense (and is more defensible) than him wanting to sing the low part and you the high.\n\nSuggestion 2 (which just came to me) can you rearrange the song so that the traditionally higher line is actually lower, by dropping it an octave? You could sing that, he the lower (but actually higher now) line, traditionally associated with a man?", "NTA. \n\nThen what does Ryan wants to do now?\n\nHe can't sing the low parts and you can't reach the high parts.

Neither of you handled your emotions perfectly that day, but if I were you I'd go back, apologize for getting frustrated, tell him you understand it must be a difficult situation for him, and ask if he is able to take on the soprano role or if you need to talk to the teacher and find another solution, and move on from the incident.", "I'm gonna go with NAH, but you could have handled it a bit better. It just sucks as a situation. As a trans guy, I can totally understand the frustration of playing a more feminine part (I know they were called contralto and soprano, but soprano is a female vocal range) so it can be dyaphoria inducing. I would bet money that he just wanted to be manly in that regard, and he really didn't want to admit to himself what his voice range pre t was. He was a little emotional , and probably could have handled the situation better as well, but he's young and being trans really sucks. Dysphoria sucks so bad. \n\nThen again, you're also young. You didn't know any better. You could have gone without saying the \"you can't have it your way all the time\" comment, because it doesn't sound like he was doing it to be selfish, but to feel better about himself.  You're still learning to navigate these things too.  If this happens again, just try and encourage him that even if he is singing a higher part, it doesn't make him any less of a man, just like you singing the lower part doesn't make you any less of a woman.  If you want to cheer him up and open up a conversation with him, I'd recommend asking if he's ever heard of singers like Nick Ptera and Chase Hoffielder. Both are men with AMAZING ranges who are still very much men, no matter what they're singing. That may make him feel a bit better?", "As someone that has been a music director on several shows - the MD should have put you both in a better situation. I have directed trans musicians/performers before and I solve this potential issue by assigning the performers an appropriate part that also plays their gender properly.  So, if I have a trans man with a higher pitched voice, I put them in the tenors and only assign them tenor parts.  They seem to appreciate just being 'one of the guys' and not being the center of attention when I call on the tenors or whatever.   \n\n\nSo if your parts were for a lower male voice and the MD assigned this to a trans guy, that's not very cool, IMO.  Whoever assigned this duet wasn't handling the situation properly, IMO.  \n\n\nBut we all live and learn, too.  And the way I've handled it might not be perfect, but I think just being aware of potential issues and nipping them off before they can even get to this point is key.  And listening to trans friends, performers, and even strangers - that's a big part.  Always be open to changing in a heart beat. :)  \n\n\nReading this story made me feel so much pain for the trans performer.  This is exactly the kind of horror situation we should work hard to avoid.", "YTA. If Ryan is in a musical theater club, he knows enough to know what ranges he can/cant sing in.

You got mad that it didn't sound right and instead of trying to come up with a creative solution (adjusting the piece, even consulting your teacher) you just berated him and tried to bully him into doing something he expressly disclosed he's not comfortable with.\n\nMore over, you used the language that \"you don't get your way\" and \"be logical\". Those are arguments that are CONSTANTLY thrown in trans people's faces when other people are trying to get them to conform to cis standards. \"You can't be a boy, you have a vagina, BE LOGICAL.\" \"You want me to call you a boy, but you're not.

It\u2019s just a song. \n\nI think it was a little presumptuous for you to assume you would sing the male part and he was disappointed because he felt attacked in that he was still a woman when apparently he identifies as a man.

They\u2019re both kids, and it seems to me OP\u2019s classmate couldn\u2019t quite express how or why this made him uncomfortable, even though it may seem obvious to us looking in. The mismatch between what you\u2019re \u201csupposed\u201d to sound/look like/be is very, very stressful, and dysphoria takes ahold of you like no other. Neither OP nor her classmate can be faulted for something like this; this kind of situation is tricky to navigate, both for the person going through it and the person at their side, so I would definitely suggest they approach their instructor about this.", "But he *did* bring his identity into it. Why else would he not want to sing \"the part originally sung by a woman\"?", "But he did! The reason he didn't want to sing the higher part was because it was originally sung by a female. He doesn't want to be associated with being female so he doesn't want to sing the female part. That is bringing his identity into it.", "Unless you make it 5'4\" or 5'2\" and then it actually is something some trans men do have to deal with. Having a small frame can be tough for male-identifying people of all persuasions in fact.", "I mean, there are a lot of people that have dysphoria over their height, just saying. Being 5'0 as a trans guy can give as much dysphoria as having a higher voice.", ">Being 5'8 is not something that is tied to a lifetime of hurt to you.\n\nI see you've never tried being a 5'8\" male on Tinder.", "True but this is a college club\u2026adolescence is tough on everyone, albeit uniquely tough on LGBT folks \n\nI assume that Ryan is getting counselling, support, etc. Either way, it\u2019s not the responsibility of those around him to accommodate him. \n\nIf they misgender or discriminate against him, or ostracize him, they are assholes. \n\nBut using logical reasoning isn\u2019t that.", "Yes but this is a college club..", "Sometimes men have high voices and can\u2019t sing those parts as well.  Some men have terrible voices and choose not to sing at all.  This is a you choose it activity, you have to play to your talent and not what you wish you had.  Everyone goes through this and sometimes you have to accept what you can and cannot do.", "I get that. But this person is surrounded by fellow college kids and laymen when it comes to trans issues. \n\nPeople with mental health issues have to navigate the world around them and it\u2019s tough. But most people aren\u2019t going to be experts on trans issues.", "I think that's premature. He's a teenager who got a bit upset because he faced a difficult situation. That doesn't mean he needs to sequester himself away from any activity that might be a little challenging just to protect anyone from having to deal with him. \n\nI did musical theatre at that age and people got upset, cried, got in arguments, got jealous of other's roles. That's life. It doesn't sound like he's constantly having emotional meltdowns, it sounds like he was having a rough time, and the girl he was paired with got frustrated very quickly, so it escalated a bit.", "They're both really young and OP says that Ryan hasn't started hormone replacement therapy. If he does intend to do that, his voice will lower as a consequence, and he'll probably be able to take the lower parts he prefers and be more comfortable singing in those ranges as time progresses. I don't see this being a repeat issue.", "He\u2019s not childish for crying. He is childish for insisting he get his way even after he tried and failed, and being disruptive enough that they had to stop for the day.", "If you're assigned the song, you two should maybe go speak with the professor that the pair of you handling a song where there's a male and a female vocal role and his pitch range matches the female part and yours matches the male part is triggering his body dysphoria and see if the professor is willing to assign you two a song where both vocal roles are men??", "Except it wasn't 'performing a role'. It was simply singing a song.", "19 is not \"only a kid\". Both of them are young adults and denigrating them with \"only a kid\" does not help.", "The only thing the instructor can really say, though, is that they should each sing the part they are actually able to sing, as OP tried to do in the first place. No reasonable person is going to assign people to sing parts they aren't capable of singing.", "I would classify him as a young adult. However, I won't judge him one way or another (that's why I called OP NTA) because it appears that he is having a mental health crisis because his voice doesn't match his identity. It doesn't seem right to judge someone who isn't able to fully process the thing they are upset about (his voice). I've had friends transition later in life (late 20s) from ftm and neither of them have a typical male voice, they both have more of a \"smokey\" female voice, meaning it's definitely higher pitched than male, but lower than the average female. In all honesty, a duet probably isn't going to help him mentally. A solo would probably be more beneficial to him (although with his voice concerns, performing may not be a good fit for him until he can resolve/work on some of the heavy feelings he has regarding his voice).", "The situation obviously causes Ryan emotional distress. Gender dysphoria can be extremely psychologically damaging. Yes, OP is completely logically right in all of this but that doesn\u2018t mean  we can\u2018t show empathy with Ryan\u2018s struggle. This is not a case of entitlement and just wanting to be stubborn. If it was some kind of past trauma that made it hard for someone to sing a certain song a kind person would also try to work around this.", "My first boyfriend was 5'2\".  Decades later, we were just swapping politics memes on messenger.  His height has always been a problem for him, particularly while dragging himself up from sweeping floors to owning the actual frachise.  His promotional presence is still a problem.  \n\nHe chose humor to cope.  But I know what sits beneath.", "You really think thats close to the same level as being trans? Come on now", "WTF, isn't 5'8\" average height for a man?", "He\u2019s just having a tough time, give him a break. I\u2019m certain he knows this is illogical, but it\u2019s distressing enough to make him cry in front of a classmate who\u2019s effectively a stranger. It\u2019s easy enough for the two of them to approach their instructor about this; it\u2019s not like they HAVE to do a male-and-female part song.", "You don't have to be an expert on trans people, though. Just consider, if you see someone clearly upset and crying, have some compassion and instead of telling them \"you need to be logical\" , if you truly can't understand, then ask them! Or just understand that they've got something going on and accept that they are feeling bad in that moment. \n\nEveryone has emotions, and in this post covid Era, many people have experienced depression in their life. We're not always %100 logical, and if you think about it, you'd be pretty distressed if you had the wrong body too.", "hormones take months if not years to deepen your voice fully, and a lot of tans men have to re-learn how to sing afterwards. \n\neven if he starts testosterone tomorrow, this will still be an issue for him for months/years", "Yannis Papadopoulos is a great example of this. He is the lead singer for a metal band (Beast in Black). The song Blind and Frozen is amazing, and he does a cover of Nightwish\u2019s Ghost Love Score, originally sung by a female soprano.", "Honestly, that's a really cool idea. One of my dearest friends is a trans dude who is very short, which is something he saw as feminine and which gave him dysphoria, but I always send him pics of famous cis men that are his height like \"you are one of many successful short kings\" lmao", "It sounds like you\u2019re making assumptions about what happened. OP\u2019s classmate isn\u2019t blaming anybody, nor is OP asking if it was her responsibility to manage her classmate\u2019s emotions. It\u2019s OK to be nice to each other, though, and it\u2019s nice that OP is looking to understand the situation better. I think it\u2019s really incredible that OP is looking for that feedback, it\u2019s very sweet.", "Life is tough, but shit, that doesn\u2019t mean we have to actively contribute to how tough it is. Presumably, they can just switch to a different song. Easy!\n\nI cried plenty in class and in front of professors when I was 17-19. Note that those ages end in \u201cteen\u201d \u2014 they\u2019re teens, they\u2019re still kids! No, crying isn\u2019t helpful, but sometimes you just can\u2019t help crying. I mean shit, the first time I cried in front of a professor, it was because I was really struggling with the workload. My professor was just talking to me about what I needed to do, and I just burst into tears. Funny to look back on, but damn, it would not have helped if she\u2019d just told me \u201ctough, sounds like a skill issue.\u201d Obviously, it WAS a skill issue\u2014I was nowhere near as equipped to contend with the workload as my peers, but I deserved a chance to learn, didn\u2019t I?", "I don\u2019t think you understand what dysphoria is. It\u2019s not just displeasure/discomfort; it\u2019s severe mental distress. You\u2019re thinking of it like an emotional response, when it\u2019s really more of a physical one. Think the difference between being afraid, and having a panic attack.", "No I think you don't see that ya'll are projecting your trauma out into the world and the rest of us need to have a boundary with that ON OCASSION without it being a melt down tear down reaction.\n\nI also have PTSD and sometimes I need to take myself home from a situation or leave something I thought I could handle. I can ask for accomodations if I really need to, but it interrupts others flow to be interjecting that kind of stuff all the time. \n\nGo to the bathroom, take a deep breath, and check maybe you reaction to the current moment is actually a reaction to past traumas or shames. If it is, then you need to back off and it the other person has requested a boundary then you might owe them an apology. \n\nTrauma makes it hard to give people the benefit of the doubt and I see that in trans people a lot. But that doesn't mean the rest of us in the shared community are deliberately triggering you. If you got triggered, that's your head to sort out.", "Lmao that's not what people are saying at all, but you're proving my point.  Why is it that whenever anyone criticizes the community you all immediately jump to things like \"wow so you're saying I don't deserve to live/exist peacefully/etc\"?  Part of living peacefully is also treating other people around you with consideration, not just expecting everyone to immediately pander to and conform with what *you* want, but your community seems to have forgotten that and just wants everything your way all the time.\n\nNewsflash: you aren't the only ones with trauma.  I was diagnosed with PTSD, anxiety, and OCD, and it's hard, but I try not to make it everyone else's problem. As halstarchild has said, you're all just constantly projecting your own trauma out onto everyone else.  It's tiresome.  \n\nA important part of dealing with trauma is learning that you can't always make it everyone else's problem.  Sometimes you have to remove yourself from a situation instead of making everyone else deal with your trauma, and also acknowledge that someone not wanting to deal with your trauma all the time doesn't mean they're \"erasing your existence\" or \"Denying your right to live\" or whatever other inane, emotional, kneejerk arguments y'all like to throw out all the time.\n\nYou expect compassion, accommodation, and understanding without giving any in return and everyone's getting tired of it.", "There's a difference between peacefully existing and insisting upon flawless acceptance and conformation from the rest of the population.", "Filling the masculine role of singing the lower part that per OP is TRADITIONALLY sung by a male vocalist. I did not mean role as in an actor\u2019s part in a play or movie.\n\nETA the divinity on I meant: the function assumed or part played by a person or thing in a particular situation.", "Yes but Ryan insisted on doing the male part. \n\nIt\u2019s music. In music and theatre assigning parts is important. \n\nIn high school I lost the part of Mortimer in Arsenic and Old Lace and was given the part of O\u2019Hara, because I was fat \ud83e\udd23", "You are correct. But if you are implying that Ryan should get his way everything something makes him cry, that is not the answer. Giving someone the wrong part is not accommodating their transgender ism. Men who are not trans can take great pride in having a high voice and being able to hit high notes. What is happening here is some internalized misogyny and he is telling a woman tht ahe can't sing low parts bc she doesn't identify as male. The parts are based on who can sing what notes, not who identifies as a man. The type of misogyny at work here is something the OP shouldn't have to deal with and saying it is lacking compassion to not go along with sexism is just wrong.", "It's obvious there was some kind of emotional upheaval.  Don't have to assume to see that's very clearly part of the story.", "No, they are not kids. They are adults and denigrating them by calling them kids does not help.", "You're comparing two different things though. Your problems are easier to fix than this one. Yours just needs some guidance and a bit of help. Trying to help someone with a math problem is completely different than someone who can't sing a certain note. It legitimately is a skill issue. If you read a few of my replies you'll see that I mentioned that the partner will need to develop that skill if they want to sing that part. 17-19 might end in teen but you're still an adult. You can legally drive on your own at 18 depending on where you live you can legally drink and you're considered an adult in every legal aspect. Yours was an educational issue which is easier to help with than a vocal one. People spend years dedicating countless hours to improve their vocals whereas someone will spend maybe 30 minutes - 2hr with a tutor to help with their studies a week. A significant difference between the two. Also no where did I mention that the partner didn't deserve a chance to learn. Just stated an obvious fact that he has a skill issue with that note. The teacher gave them both parts that they can do, but he chose the harder one for himself for personal reasons without the skill to back it up. Which in turn again is different than your situation, you didn't choose to take classes you can't do. highschool curriculum is set in place for everyone with a few electives. So you struggling with math/socials/English/science or whatever it is, is different than someone intentionally choosing a part they can't do.", "It's still something he's going to have to manage either way though.  I do understand what dysphoria is, but it's also something he's going to have to manage, especially in situations like this.  Having dysphoria is an explanation, but it's not an excuse, and many commentators here are trying to use it as an excuse.", "I'm implying that Ryan should nor have been snapped at in response to his emotions. \n(Also, transgenderism isn't the right word. It's not an ideology or religion. It's just a condition some people have) \n\nAnd it's also not misogyny. Ryan's dysphoria does not invalidate contraltos. In fact, this who situation had NOTHING to do with OP's gender and everything to do with HIS gender and his dysphoria.  It is absolutely distressing to be stuck singing the part a female singer is singing in the original, as a man. I'd feel uncomfortable and dysphoric too.", "Why would you argue that someone is lying about having PTSD. As someone with PTSD, surely you can understand how harmful that could be to someone who may have experience trauma?", "It's so cute how you just keep parroting definitions as if that proves a point.  I think I'll listen to my therapist over your shoddy little copy-and-paste work.  For all you can copy-and-paste, you can't seem to think critically about anything, so I'd advise against whatever career in armchair diagnosing you've got going.  How would you know if I fit all those points you mindlessly paste or not?\n\nGenuinely: thanks for the laugh.  It was a good one."]}
