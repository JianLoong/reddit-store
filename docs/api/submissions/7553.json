Aurroa spends three weeks with me every month. The other week is at her bio-mother.\n\nAurora and Anne have a beautiful mother-daughter relationship. She even calls her mom. Mia loathes that her  daughter calls anne's mom and has started childish arguments over this. I find this really stupid as it's the child child's choice, who they call mum or dad.\n\nAnyway, the day before Aurora's birthday, she asked if anna could adopt and officially be her mother, We were both overjoyed as anna has always loved aurora as her own. The only problem was mia. we both agreed to talk to her during tomorrow's party. Aurora didn't want to be involved. She doesn't like to interact with her bio-mother.\n\nHalfway through the celebration (the next day), we asked mia if we could go inside to talk. She gave use the usual cold looks and eyes. After explaining the situation, I urged her to do this for aurora's sake. She first asked if we were serious. She gave ud both angry looks before walking out the door. I was confused why she walked out before hearing shouting outside.\n\nShe had gone to aurora to confront her. Though aurora hates confrintiation, and she knew this. She shouted in Aurora if she wanted to be adopted by another woman. I immediately told her to take this inside. That's when she began to throw accusations woman. I immediately told her to take this inside. That's when she began to throw accusations to wards me. She sreamed that I used my family's money to bribe her daughter's love. Allege that I have been turning her daughter against her. Telling everyone while she struggled to support her daughter, I was enjoying my life. The lies went one and one. I made my daughter go inside and told everyone to leave adter her \"speach\".\n\nThe rest of the day was a complete mess. Aurora locked herslelf in her room untill she cried to sleep. She was looking forward to her first two-digit birthday. I called in sick for her as she's been feeling to down too down to go to school. I still have been trying to contact mia, but she won't answer. I feel awful about the turnout of the situation. I know I'm innocent, but I'm still shocked about her reaction. I want to second opimions, though, Did I do anything wrong? AITA or not. \n\nI will give more information in the comments as I don't want to write too much. I had cut a lot of details out.", "created_utc": 1673960498, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ebq8m/aita_for_supporting_my_daughters_aurora_wish_to/", "score": 1201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You just proposed a mother give up her child because it is good for your family. Your ex is an active and involved parent, because as you described she does one week every month, for the purposes of shared care she is still routinely involved in her daughter\u2019s life. \n\nAre you alienating your child from her mother? What would prompt a child to want to be adopted and no longer have any relationship with her mother? Why would you bring that up at a birthday party? Do you just like rubbing it in your exes face that you\u2019re doing better and that your child loves you more? \n\nUnless there\u2019s more information this reeks of missing reasons. A child doesn\u2019t just get in their head the idea of adoption. Are you actually using your family money to make your life and home just that much nicer so that your child is rejecting time with her less well-off mother?", "YTA\n\nSurely you understand the basic concept of people who have two involved parents aren't up for adoption, correct?", "INFO: How exactly did you expect Mia to react when you basically asked her to terminate her legal rights to her child so your wife could adopt her? You seem awfully casual about something that would be life altering for everyone, including Mia.\n\nIn terms of judgement, I feel like you are leaving out some important information. Mia's concerns about your material wealth buying her daughter's affection, seem like they could be a complete copout or the actual truth. Your post does nothing to prove that Mia is wrong. Why do you have majority custody? Is her mother considered dangerous to her daughter or did you have better legal representation? Is Aurora in conselling for all of this extra turmoil in her life? Does she have access to family counseling with her bio mom? \n\nAt face value you seem like this great dad. But there are some shady things here as well. You had to know that Mia would not react kindly to you expecting her to just give you and your wife her daughter. You say that she is prone to blowing up out of nowhere, well this definitely wasn't out of nowhere. \n\nIt's odd that you would do this her child's birthday party, when you know that Mia is going to want to hear it from said child that she no longer wants Mia as a mom. The fact that you claim to be innocent is also a red flag, because you definitely ARE NOT. \n\nThere feels like there are some missing missing reasons here.", "Her mother is alive and you want her to give up her parental rights so that your wife can adopt her?\n\nAbsolutely not. \nYTA.", "Of course YTA. Was your daughter's 10th party *really* the place to do this? As a parent yourself, you should have been able to put yourself in Mia's shoes, how would you have felt if Mia had a bf or husband and they wanted to adopt your child while you were still alive? You should have anticipated that Mia would have a strong reaction. Also, part of parenting is breaking hard truths to your child. Instead of indulging Aurora in thinking that Anna could \"become her legal mom\" you both should have sat her down and explained why that is not possible: She already has a mom, who is still living, and still in the picture, even if it's only 25% of the time. If your daughter really hates her bio mom as much as you say, then why not just go through the legal steps of obtaining full custody?", "YTA. \n\nThis isn\u2019t going to go well. It sounds like you and your wife are engaging in parental alienation. Therapy all around is needed.", "How on Earth did you think it was a good idea to ***HAVE THIS CONVERSATION AT YOUR DAUGHTER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY?*** You must be a special type of stupid.... and also, YTA...", "YTA massively. **You were asking a mom to give up her child**... and you think that would go well ?!?\n\nYou need to get out of your fantasy and dellusionnal world. That's not how life works.\n\nYou have no right trying to separate you ex from your child. You were out of line.", "Can a woman adopt a child if the bio-mother is still in the picture? Or does bio-mom need to surrender parental rights first? Shitty mother or not, I imagine this is a really touchy subject. I can't even fathom a parent willingly give up their child unless there's a good reason.\n\nYTA. Probably your current spouse as well. I personally think she should've gently dissuaded your daughter from this idea. She could've expressed how flattered she is at the thought, but that your daughter has a bio-mother and to rob her of that relationship would not be fair.", "YTA. You are not INNOCENT. You\u2019re an AH.", "YTA - how would you feel if the roles were reverse and Mia did this to you? Asked you to let her adopt your daughter who you could only see once a week for whatever reason? I think a conversation should of been had because maybe aurora sees the relationship your wife and your kids have and wants to be a part and not have to deal with moving back and forth and the disharmony. She\u2019s also only 10, it could of been something you circled back to as the adult and talked to Mia about how aurora is feeling and included her into the parenting.", "YTA for alienating your daughter\u2019s mother and then asking her to give her daughter up for adoption\u2026.and doing it at a birthday party. What is wrong with you?", "INFO:\n\nIf you have concerns about how Aurora is handling the joint custody arrangement, why not hash those concerns out in family court? \n\nOr why not discuss options with a family therapist to make sure Aurora  feels secure in her role in your family regardless of if Anne is her legal mother?\n\nWhy is your first response to hearing your *10 year old child express that she wishes she had a more permanent role in your family* to be **overjoyed**? That news should have been alarming to you. Your daughter *has* an actively involved mother who has no desire to terminate her parental rights. And yet, when you hear that your child is willing to severe any legal connection with her mother in an effort to feel secure as Anne\u2019s \u201cdaughter\u201d, you \u2026 *encourage* that?", "Why in the world would you ask her mother that *in the middle of a birthday party*? You and your wife can\u2019t possibly be this dense. \nYTA\n\nEditing to add: since you have a split custody agreement, Mia would have to **sign her rights away**, then I\u2019d imagine you\u2019d conveniently take away that 1 week of the month that she sees her daughter.", "I think YTA for approaching this topic at a birthday party. You had to have known Mia wasn\u2019t going to handle it well.", "INFO why does Aurora hate bio-mom? like what has she done?", "YTA.  Your daughter has a mom who she lives with \\~25% of the time.  Do you really expect Mia to take on the role of ex-mother of her own daughter?\n\nNo reason Anne couldn't just keep being the great stepmother that she loves.  It isn't like you award the mother title to the one you like the most.  You should have explained this to your 10 year old daughter rather than creating a lot of drama and stress.", "YTA\n\nHow did you imagine that this would be anything but a fraught conversation, deeply hurtful to your daughter's bio-mother, and likely to lead to confrontation?\n\nAnd you thought *your daughter's birthday party* was the right time and place to bring up this issue?\n\nHow was this going to be anything but a disaster?\n\nThis is the type of thing you bring up for discussion in a neutral location, with the child cared for elsewhere by a babysitter, (a mature and responsible adult with life experience, not a teenager) who is warned that the mother may be upset, and may come looking for the child, and to stay inside, with the doors locked, and not let in anyone but you or your wife.  Or better yet, the child stays at a friend's house, the adults fully warned, so that the bio-mom can't immediately track her down. \n\nIdeally, if you have a family therapist, the therapist would be there to help facilitate this.\n\nThink things through, in the future, to consider the appropriate time and place for difficult conversations.  \n\nYou didn't act in a way that was supportive of your daughter's desire.  You set a ten-year-old up for an ugly confrontation that ruined her birthday, and that she was far too young and inexperienced to navigate.", "YTA You know your ex has problems with your wife being seen as mum. Why on earth would you bring up the adoption idea at your daughter\u2019s party? Obviously ex was not going to take it well and of course she would want to know daughters view point. You\u2019re not an ass for wanting the adoption but you certainly are an idiot for going about it in this way. I think you owe your daughter a huge apology as your actions directly led to her party being ruined.", "YTA - you\u2019re daughter doesn\u2019t sound old enough to understand what adoption actually means. You should\u2019ve sat her down to explain what it is and maybe let her think about it for a bit before confronting her mom at a gathering (unexpectedly).", "Did you really expect her bio mother to take this news well ? But you told her at the child's  party. That was a bad move. Bio mother has the child one week in four so she is not an absent parent. She may not be a great parent but she is involved. So this news was never going to go down well. YTA just for the timing and venue. Whether the request is fair is another matter best resolved with legal advice and action.", "YTA. In most cases you don\u2019t just choose your parents. If you daughter spends part of her time living with her bio mum and therefore having a relationship with her then why would any adoption be necessary? And to raise this at a party? Unless you hoped that doing this with others around would in some way limit bio mums reaction?  Be careful, if it even appears you are trying to influence or change your daughters opinion/relationship with her bio mum you could find your self accused of parental alienation.", "YTA for how this was handled.  First of you and your SO should have t as lked with the Biological Mother before you talked to your Daughter.  Even if your daughter brought it up. You should try to understand why your daughter has issues with her biological mother and help the biological mother understand the issues to improve her relationship.", "Yes YTA, she has a mother who she has a relationship with and sees on a regular basis. The correct response was, I know you love her as a mom and she loves you as her daughter, but you have a mom, who also loves you. You're very lucky to have 2 women who both love you. Adoption legally severs all ties and isn't reversible, you asked the woman who birthed the child to give up all legal rights to said child on the child's birthday. This was a ridiculous request to begin with knowing she's not ok with the child calling her stepmother mom. You made sure to do it at a time and place to ensure that there'd be a scene. Did you apologize for the lack of judgment?", "Sorry but YTA and I\u2019m guessing you already know that. You did not think about anyone else but yourself & chose the path that best suited you. And now you\u2019re going to deal with the consequences of that choice. At this point, this topic should be closed for discussion. Your priority should be your daughter & dealing with her feelings. You really screwed up... with your daughter & Mia. You owe both of them an apology.", "YTA. This was not a conversation to be held at a 10th Birthday party. How you think it was the time and place blows my mind. That Mia has a fraught relationship with Aurora does not mean that she does not love her daughter. It's not wrong for Aurora to want Anne as her mother but this was always going to be a difficult discussion and whatever you Anne or Aurora think about this, it should have been handled with much more sensitivity that you possess. To ask a mother to give up her daughter is a huge deal and something that needed to be broached carefully. You are one massive AH.", "YTA.  I don\u2019t know why you thought bringing this up would be ok, especially at a bday party.\n\nYou know Mia has a problem with Anne\u2019s bond with Aurora and being called mom. It doesn\u2019t take a mind reader to tell you she would most definitely not be open to the idea of Anne adopting her.  \n\nAlso, legally I don\u2019t believe adoption is possible unless Mia gives up her parental rights.  Is that what you were asking her to do?", "YtA. 1st of all, why would you have a conversation that you know is not going to go well on her birthday. Secondly, why would you even have this conversation when your daughter was around. Does your daughter even understand what it means if her stepmom adopted her? She might not understand what her mom has to give up for her step mom to do that. Has her mom ever given any indication that she would want to give up her parental rights? While her Mom probably didn't handle herself appropriately, You completely blindsided her at her kid's birthday party, which was not the appropriate place to do this, if at all. Also based on your description it appears she asked you one day and you asked her mom the next, Did you even research if this was legally possible if her mom does not want to give up her rights to let her be adopted. This is a life changing event that deserves more than a 24-hour thought process. You did not give any thought into how her mom would feel or how she may react when confronted with the question. If you had, you would not have approached it the way you did.", "YTA parental alienation is real.", "Well, if you are in a state that allows three legal parents like California I would say N T A, but if it means bio mom gives up her rights to kid for this and their rights were not taken by the courts then you would be T A. So im just gonna go with not enough information; needs professional licensed guidance.", "Yea that is a giant YTA from me.\n\nAsking at the birthday party if Mia would terminate her rights forever to this child, basically erase her as if she never existed, change her birth certificate (I assume you are not US because of \"mum\" but that is what happens here) and forget Mia for good...yea no. She is 10. This is not a casual thing, this is forever and Mia would have zero rights to her child. She (Aurora) could easily resent that this happened in just a few years. I was adopted at that age by a stepparent. I loved (he died) him dearly, my bio dad was a deadbeat. Mia is not. Aurora is going to understand all of this when she is older and if the adoption goes through, she is going to hate both of you for it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThink about it, would you be OK if Mia had a new husband and just out of nowhere decided she wanted her husband to adopt Aurora? You know that makes it as if you never existed, as if he is her bio dad, and you have zero legal rights to that child anymore?", "YTA for doing this at the party. You should have arranged a separate time to discuss", "I'm getting the feeling that you do buy your daughters love, and at 10 that can go a long way to who you want to be your mum. I think you knew this and you used your daughter to hurt your ex knowing she can't financially treat her the way you can. Shame on you. Money isn't love.", "YTA. Do any of you realize you are asking Mia to give up the rights to her own daughter? Why the fuck would you ask Mia this at a birthday party too? I'm going to assume some parental alienation is indeed going on on your half. I'd like to hear it from Mia's side too. That would be a treat.", "Yta,\nHer mother is involved in her life.  Why would you support having her give up rights.  I can't believe the courts would look favorably on what you did.  They would probably go after you from parental alienation.  Also her mom wants to be involved what a cruel and AH move.  What you should have said to your daughter is that your wife is a second mom to her and she is lucky to have 2 moms who love her.", "YTA for bringing it up to Mia at a party. You had to know she would not be happy about this", "YTA. You never should have brought it up at a party. You knew your ex would be deeply hurt. There was absolutely no reason to ambush her like that. Honestly, you should have really thought about if it was worth bringing up at all. She isn\u2019t an absent mother and you know she is unlikely to give up her rights. It probably would have been better to tell your daughter that it doesn\u2019t matter what a piece of paper says and if she wants your wife to be her mother then she is.", "YTA You shouldn\u2019t have scheduled this emotional discussion during your daughter\u2019s birthday celebration. Why didn\u2019t you plan a meeting to discuss on some other day instead of creating a huge risk of spoiling the party? \n\nYou are not an AH for discussing this, but your timing was atrocious.", "YTA for asking a mother to let go of her child, your daughter is 10 so of course she is having issues with her mom. I did. Every girl does. 100% YTA. How would you feel if this was the other way around?", "Oh yes, in the middle of a party is the perfect time to bring up this life-altering conversation! TYA.", "WTF should be a valid judgement for posts like this. Jeez.\n\nYta OP, big loud, YTA. For reasons so many other commenters have elaborated.", "Why does Aurora want to be adopted by your wife.  What is her reason?  What has Mia done so wrong that this would be what\u2019s best?  If it\u2019s simply because Aurora wants to, that tells me that maybe the money comment has more to do with this than you are letting on.  Unless Mia is unfit this conversation should never have happened.  I think you are a huge AH.  YTA", "YTA \u201cI know I\u2019m innocent\u201d\u2014 that\u2019s where you are dead wrong. You are guilty AF. All these comments should point you in the direction of why.", "YTA for doing this at your child's birthday, with your child present (even if she was outside or in another room). Did you really expect this to go down completely fine with Mia? Because if so, I wonder what else you've been completely oblivious to in relation to family dynamics / relationships.\n\nMia shouldn't have gone outside and confronted her daughter like that but I'm guessing that getting such an emotional curveball, she probably reacted poorly.", "Yea lets say Aurora asked you if she could be adopted by Mias new guy, no problems right? Because its the childs choice so you shouldnt get upset over it.\n\nESH (except Aurora). You for doing this shit on her birthday. Anna for also going through with this. Mia for taking it out on Aurora on her party.", "YTA for timing alone. That\u2019s not a discussion for a birthday party. If you had that conversation any other time you\u2019d be fine", "yta.  She has a mother, who is involved in her life.  This is a way to yoink any custody away from your ex.  You are not widowed and she is still alive and has her for a week.  What did you all do to your daughter so she would hate her mother so much she wants to be adopted by your wife?  You are taking her parental  rights away and I'd be hiring a lawyer asap.  You and your wife alienated this child from her own mother, and then have the balls to bring this up at a party.  You should of nipped this in the bud the moment she asked.  You did you use money to bribe your daughters love and instead of helping your daughter with her relationship with her rightful mother, you replaced her.", "YTA. You say you know your innocent.  There is nothing nuanced in your post, which usually translates to \"don't believe anything this person has written.\" I'd love to read Mia's response to you and this entire situation. 100% you aren't as innocent as you think you are.", "You aren\u2019t innocent. Seems like parental alienation using your money. A two parent household va a single mother.\n\nYou your wife are both big gaping assholes YTA", "YTA not for supporting your daughter but for the way you dealed with this situation. There was no need to have that conversation at the party, no need at all. You wanted your ex to explode. Did you think she was going to immediately accept that her daughter wants another person to be her mom? What on Earth were you thinking? I hope you are at least taking your daughter to therapy because her 10th birthday trauma is on you.", "You\u2019re not innocent sorry! Having this type of conversation at your daughter\u2019s birthday party was the stupidest thing ever! This may be what your daughter wants, but did you all really expect her bio mom to just nicely say yes to another woman legally adopting her daughter? Are you asking your ex to give up all parental rights as well? If this is what your daughter truly wants than you need to look at taking it through the court system for full custody. But if your ex is a decent mother and the court has no reason to take her daughter away from her, then your just putting you child through all this for nothing! I would highly suggest some counseling for your daughter and as a family first!\n\nEdit to say ESH but your daughter.", "So you encouraged a child to call another woman mother over her birth mother who seems to be present in her life? from what you've shared YTA", "YTA alienating her mother as much as posssible", "YTA. I don't even understand like.. Her mom is around, she has custody 25% of the month and you're asking her.... to let her daughter be adopted and to basically give up on her being her parent? In what world did you think that would be a good idea?", "I think YTA for bringing this up at a party and for your kid's birthday. How did you think this conversation would go? If you didn't want to ruin your daughter's birthday, you should have picked a different time to address this.\n\nMy partner's biological father didn't even try to see him or pay child support after he was 8 or so and still wouldn't let his step father adopt him as a kid so he was adopted as an adult. Your ex sees her child regularly. Of course she's not going to quietly give up her kid.  \n\nI also suspect there's more to this whole situation than you're saying.", "Yta. Not because you support your daughter, but because you did it at her birthday party, on her birthday. A discussion such as that-should have been left for another day. And probably done with other reasonable adults around in case it got heated.", "YTA, she has a bio mum who still wants to be her mum. You\u2019re not coparenting well in enabling your child to make those decisions. I do feel bad for your ex. To be pretty much solidly told you are second best as a mum must be heart breaking", "YTA. YOU and ANNA chose to ruin the birthday party by bringing this up thinking you could use the social situation to control Mia's response. The two of you are a problem here. You are encouraging your daughter to stop having a relationship with her own mother, who clearly seems to want to be part of her daughter's life. This is parental alienation. It is abusive. You are the problem.", "YTA and what you are doing is called parental alienation. Your ex should take you to court for full custody. And I hope you have to pay a lot more child support.\n\nAdoption is when the parent is not in the picture. Your ex is. What you tried to do is a huge slap in the face to her. You're awful.\n\nAlso you are 100% at fault here for ruining the party. What was YOUR thinking to bring this up on your daughter's birthday? There is no way this would be a peaceful conversation. Of course bio mom got upset and caused a scene. My thinking is you pulled this stunt in front of friends and family hoping bio mom would control her emotions. So buddy, YOU 1000% ruined the party. That's on you. When you see daughter crying because of how badly you managed this situation?  Your fault too.\n\nYou need family and individual counseling to learn how to be a functional BLENDED family that does not shut bio mom out. One day your daughter will realize what you did to her bio mom and I doubt that will go well. You may lose your daughter over this if you don't figure out how to have a mom and STEPmom in her life in a healthy way.", "Yta if her mom was deceased then it would be fine, obviously but her mother is alive. Not only that but the two of you decide to essentially corner this woman on her daughter\u2019s birthday and attempt to explain to her why she should no longer be a mother.", "YTA. She gave BIRTH TO THAT CHILD. She carried her for 9 months and is still VERY present in her life. It looks like you successfully turned your daughter against her mother to get the happy family situation with your wife. It's ok if your daughter likes your wife more but to suggest a mother, who hasn't been a horrible/bad parent to the child and is active in her life, give up her own child is the biggest ah move.", "This is a shitty situation all around. There are AH actions/behaviors on several sides. Your ex was a total AH for screaming at your daughter definitely. But also, you didn't make the beat choices in suggesting it at the party. You also don't mention having looked into the legality of it. In my state a step parent can't adopt unless the bio parent is dead or their rights are terminated.\nI totally get your daughter's wish to be legally adopted and make it official, but you're the adult here, you should have looked into it more before bringing it up to your ex to see if it was even a possibility under the law of wherever you are.", "Adopted by my dad when I was 11!

And note that terminating parental rights would most likely NOT be the goal outcome here.", "YTA and a horrible parent for how you handled this. Are you really this stupid??? What is wrong with you???", "YTA and a complete moron if you think an involved parent is going to relinquish their rights so that your current wife can adopt their child.", "YTA - why the F would you talk to Mia about this DURING the birthday party? Also, you have a custody agreement and from everything I\u2019ve seen, Mia might be shitty but not to the point where it warrants her parental rights be taken away. \n\nI feel bad for Aurora, I can only imagine how traumatized and confused she is because of this.", "Huge AH and knowing how you have no care for asking that to Mia in her daughter birthday,I start to think you deliberately take away her child from her and with your dear/wonderful wife Anna had manipulated the all thing very well! Your daughter is too young now but I hope she will open her eyes one day!! You are disgusting hope karma will hit you/wife very very hard", "YTA. How would you feel if Mia asked you to terminate your rights and let another man adopt your child? Why the hell would you do this during your daughters birthday party?", "Yta. First off, she has a mother. You should have kindly asked why she wants to be adopted and after hearing the reasoning, explained that although your new partner loves and cherishes her like a daughter, legally her mother will always be her mother. She has 2 loving mothers and no piece of paper will change that. You should have shut that down immediately. Her mum must have been so hurt and blindsided, I can\u2019t even imagine. She is also an AH for confronting your daughter like that and making a  scene.

Aurroa spends three weeks with me every month. The other week is at her bio-mother.\n\nAurora and Anne have a beautiful mother-daughter relationship. She even calls her mom. Mia loathes that her  daughter calls anne's mom and has started childish arguments over this. I find this really stupid as it's the child child's choice, who they call mum or dad.\n\nAnyway, the day before Aurora's birthday, she asked if anna could adopt and officially be her mother, We were both overjoyed as anna has always loved aurora as her own. The only problem was mia. we both agreed to talk to her during tomorrow's party. Aurora didn't want to be involved. She doesn't like to interact with her bio-mother.\n\nHalfway through the celebration (the next day), we asked mia if we could go inside to talk. She gave use the usual cold looks and eyes. After explaining the situation, I urged her to do this for aurora's sake. She first asked if we were serious. She gave ud both angry looks before walking out the door. I was confused why she walked out before hearing shouting outside.\n\nShe had gone to aurora to confront her. Though aurora hates confrintiation, and she knew this. She shouted in Aurora if she wanted to be adopted by another woman. I immediately told her to take this inside. That's when she began to throw accusations woman. I immediately told her to take this inside. That's when she began to throw accusations to wards me. She sreamed that I used my family's money to bribe her daughter's love. Allege that I have been turning her daughter against her. Telling everyone while she struggled to support her daughter, I was enjoying my life. The lies went one and one. I made my daughter go inside and told everyone to leave adter her \"speach\".\n\nThe rest of the day was a complete mess. Aurora locked herslelf in her room untill she cried to sleep. She was looking forward to her first two-digit birthday. I called in sick for her as she's been feeling to down too down to go to school. I still have been trying to contact mia, but she won't answer. I feel awful about the turnout of the situation. I know I'm innocent, but I'm still shocked about her reaction.

It\u2019s how he sees each homes structure. \nIn my eyes, being all pissy about it will do me or bio dad any good. 4 parents is 4 loving adults in his life. \nThat being said, I know it Can be a very natural reaction to feel like your place as a parent is being taken away if the child considers a non bio parent \u201cyour title.\u201d \nI have sympathy, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s best to deny a child the ability to call a step parent mom or dad IF the CHILD feels like that person is a mom or dad and chose to call them that on their own.", "Absolutely. I think she needs to apologize to her daughter and make things right there as much as she can, but this post is about OP and how much of an AH he is.

She is afraid. The question here is \"Why ?\".
