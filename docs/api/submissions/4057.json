Also he did not \u201cpay into\u201d your house.

That is not your situation. \n\nUnless you added him to the deed or signed some sort of contract with him when he moved in that he would get some sort of compensation in this situation, he\u2019s just being stupid. \n\nNot a lawyer, just an anxious single female homeowner who looks into this stuff sometimes just in case.", "Hey, I don't know either and just to be clear I'm not sharing legal advice. \n\nIn some places I believe that could be seen as \"common law\" and it's possible the law would see your assets as combined.

I honestly don't know a way to figure what he should've paid, but half does feel too much considering if hypothetically you both earned the same amount the whole time then you'd have saved just as much but also came out way ahead because his contribution was your profit. Honestly I feel like the way that would make sense is a common law response where the initial investment and equity pre him moving in would naturally go to you, with the rest being split per your investment amounts, at least that feels fair with nobody being capitalized on.", "Do you honestly deep down think it's fair that you got to live with a partner you claim to care about until it's not convenient to what you want in life, and then you get to walk away being the only one to gain what is most likely a pretty significant amount of money off of his contributions to the home you funded together for the majority of the time you had it?", "All of the above advice depends on location.

We also signed a cohabitation agreement before we moved in together to define who owns what and to forego Common Law rules.

They're partners, most people don't date and live together with the idea that they will split up, he may have planned to stay together indefinitely and clearly is hurt by how she says he responds. I explained this already, if they both earn the same amount, the both saved the same amount, except all his spending, rather than eventually being a shared asset, was lost because she wants to move and leave, taking with her a huge net gain and making his investment in their relationship a huge loss. Pretty self explanatory. What you described as him gaining something isn't any different than what she could accomplish.", "She saved for the house and had been living there by herself without his help, so actually it IS different to what he was able to (not) Accomplish until she let him move in with her.", "That is until she made it a shared thing that he contributed to equally, but he didn't get an equal return, she paid half but got double in return for the entirety of his time with her, I believe 2 and a half years, which doesn't seem right at all to me. I'm not saying split half the total equity, but at least what he contributed to the investment, that's even leaving out the appreciation in value the property almost definitely had.", "He didn't contribute equally though? He did not contribute half the deposit nor pay for any maintenance etc during the time he has lived there.    \n\n\nI agree it would be reasonable if he had asked to have his contribution pro-rata'd if they moved out but that is in this day and age not a common approach so the onus was on him to negotiate that when he moved in. Unfortunately he hasn't got a leg to stand on.... which very well may turn him off the relationship which is fair enough", "Having a leg to stand on legally and being a decent person aren't related at all most of the time. That's the same argument as saying a business owner deserves to make millions from the labor of the people they hire and pay poverty wages because they took the risk starting the business, which I disagree with as well. He provided value, it shouldn't be taken advantage of for just her gain.", "I at no point mentioned legally, she clearly is in the clear legally.  \nI'm talking about socially and the social expectation for this situation is that he would have to pay rent and not get equity after such a short time UNLESS he negotiated it and they agreed beforehand.  \n\n\nIf she had NO mortgage at all and was charging him rent - that would be considered very odd but the way it stands is the most common way I see in real life and also on all my late nights binging AITA when I can't sleep.  \n\n\nHe was NOT taken advantage of. He got a place to live at great discount to what he was previously paying. You keep harping on this point that he gained nothing so I can't be bothered continuing the debate because that is clearly not the case and you just keep coming back to it.", "NTA but in my country after 3 years living together it\u2019s seen as a de facto relationship an treate the same as marriage, so you have to be careful with that. I know your situation if different Though.", "NTA. He paid rent. He didn't pay the mortgage. He paid part of the utilities. At best, he's a lodger. Did he pay fair market value? If not, he's already benefitted financially by being able to save money with below market rent. \n\nThis kind of thing is why I would tell my kids to never, ever move in with an SO and pay part of the mortgage. Pay rent, with a lease, legal and documented, yes. This kind of arrangement? No. It's too messy.\n\nHaving said that, I wish you all the best, OP. Tell BF he paid rent, and wish him the best with his new house that his savings have helped him to purchase.", "Only point of concern would be common law marriage laws and cohabitation in your state. Idk how many states even still have this, but for example I think Texas is 5 years. I can't imagine any state being more regressive than Texas though, so you're probably fine.", "NTA\n\nhe is trying to rob you blind. His contributions to mortgage were basically rent for living there. as you said, she couldn't just live there for free. He didn't wife up, that's his problem.", "OP=NTA\n\nUnless there was an agreement beforehand, Nope on the rebate.    \nTell him if he wants the money back, he can pay you the GOING rate for rent in return.  You'll take it out of \"HIS Money\"--oh you mean his rent would have been more than his shared monthly payments?\n\nHis name is not on the deed, you paid for improvement and I presume taxes(as well as down payment).", "Don\u2019t forget most of that went to interest and not the loan balance.  so if really doesn\u2019t work out that way.  Usually 90% of payment goes to bank for Interest in the first several years", "NTA\n\nWhere is all the money that he was supposed to be saving?\n\nYou owe him nothing.", "He\u2019s your bf not your sugar baby/kept man. If you had been renting would he demand half the rent back too? NTA", "Did he make any material improvements in the house?  Repairs, upgrades, or remodeling?", "NTA Don't let him steal your hard earned equity", "NTA. Lol! *facepalm* Are people seriously this stupid and rude? I would have laughed in his face, because it\u2019s seriously stupid.", "Depends where you live and how long..\n\nI would suggest a fair amount to pay back is the % of the mortgage that he paid that went to pay the principal (plus the % increase in the value of house. )\n\nA house is both an investment and a place to live. So you benefited by him moving in and paying towards your investment (principal plus increase in house value) and when you broke up you got the money he paid in as cash\n\nSo YTA for profiting off a romantic relationship.\n\nBut he doesn't get all the mortgage back. You can also factor in closing costs and maintenance etc. \n\nBut he deserves a % of the investment. (This assumes you made money on owning and selling the house)", "INFO Did he pay his rent into your account or directly to the mortgage account?", "Don't forget to add all those expensive utilities! Electric, Internet, Sewer & Water, Garbage & Recycling, Gas/oil heat. Cable, satellite or streaming.  God so many bills! Taxes!", "If his name is not on the title or the mortgage papers, then NTA.", "NTA but....you need to speak to an attorney soon. Get your legal ducks in a row. He clearly believes he has a claim and you need to be prepared with the absolute correct, legal information. Do not tell him you are doing this though.  Good luck!! You may have to evict him through the court system and change all the locks...............(Simply living together, regardless of the length of time involved, does not create a marriage by common law or any other method.)", "NTA - Unfortunately, this is a side affect of living together before you are married. He had the choice of making an agreement with you when he moved in on whether he was paying rent (which is how you saw it) or paying part of the mortgage (which is how he saw it, possiblely due to poor word choices on your part, reference your use of \"mortgage\" in your post). This should hsve been clear before he moved in - if he didn't like the terms, he could habe gotten his own place.\n\nHow much would he have paid to rent a room in a similar house with unfettered access to the rest of the house? Maybe a compromise would be to pay him the difference (or part of it). Possibly he was still paying less, which could be pointed out to him. As you say, no one lives for free.", "Tell him you weren\u2019t his momma. And yes he was a tenant. Its going to be real fun for him when he buys his house and has to pay for everything and find out he\u2019d definitely charge rent if someone ever moved in with his sorry ass.", "NTA. He would have had to pay rent anywhere he lived. He doesn\u2019t get that back. Don\u2019t give him anything.", "YTA. If he was contributing towards the mortgage he should get some of the proceeds of selling the house.", "NTA If this was your boyfriend\u2019s expectations in the beginning, he should have said so."]}
