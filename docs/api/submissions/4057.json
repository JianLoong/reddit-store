Typically living with someone else in a roommate type situation or even as a couple, you'd split the costs, but in this case splitting the costs doesn't feel fair because it only seems to benefit you. I get paying half the utilities, but paying half the mortgage doesn't make any sense at all because your half that you pay is grows your investment in your equity, but he gains nothing from his, it's just more gain for you. I think YTA in the sense that I definitely see how he feels taken advantage of as he effectively gained nothing from this situation and you leave pocketing all the money he paid plus any additional value from the property appreciating in value. I personally wouldn't feel right capitalizing on someone in this way, especially if they were someone I apparently loved or cared enough about to live with as a team.", "NTA.

I would never live in someone\u2019s house and not expect to pay.", "But he was a tenant - you owned the home and he paid rent to you, the owner.

LOL", "Except he was \u2018just a tenant\u2019 in regard to paying. He only paid for bills and the mortgage. He didn\u2019t pay for the updates", "He was able to save money by staying with you, he got a better deal.  \n\nI might be inclined to pay him back if he paid for upgrades to the house. But without that no, he shouldn\u2019t expect payback without prior agreements.\n\nTalk to lawyer though. Before you say anything else to him.", "Tenant with benefits.", "Tell him yes. Just a tenant.

Best wishes on your new future!", "If he persists in bugging you, OP tell him you are now invoicing him for whatever the difference is what he pays monthly vs. half of what the market rent for a home of your size is.  When he balks at that, say I have it in writing that you agreed if we ever broke up that you'd pay what you really owe me as rent.  WHEN he undoubtedly says there was never a written agreement that he'd pay OP anything back!  Tell him, \"Exactly.\"  Also tell him to kick rocks.\n\nNTA.", "Wrong. The state I live in only requires that they present themselves as married. That\u2019s it. No minimum period of cohabitation. \n\nedit: Granted, few states anymore even recognize it to begin with, but OP should make sure that there isn't some weird bylaw that gives him ground.", "No. He\u2019s taking up space in your house. It\u2019s no different than if you rented out one of the bedrooms to someone and then evicted them. \n\nThe person commenting about common law is pretty much just wrong. Being \u201ccommon law married\u201d is much more complicated than just being in a relationship and living together. You would have to be both living as and presenting yourselves as being a married couple (like telling people you\u2019re married, wearing rings, etc.) and he would have to make a strong enough case to a judge. Also he did not \u201cpay into\u201d your house. You\u2019re the one on the deed, you\u2019re the one on the mortgage, he paid *you* and *you* paid the mortgage. \n\nI think actually what they\u2019re talking about has to do with if you were legally married and your house was considered \u201cpremarital property\u201d (meaning you owned it before marriage so it wouldn\u2019t be split if you divorced), but if during the marriage the other person could prove that they put a significant amount of their own money into like renovating or directly increasing the value of the house, they might be able to argue for being compensated for that. That is not your situation. \n\nUnless you added him to the deed or signed some sort of contract with him when he moved in that he would get some sort of compensation in this situation, he\u2019s just being stupid. \n\nNot a lawyer, just an anxious single female homeowner who looks into this stuff sometimes just in case.", "Hey, I don't know either and just to be clear I'm not sharing legal advice. \n\nIn some places I believe that could be seen as \"common law\" and it's possible the law would see your assets as combined. So yes, potentially in some regions he might have a claim to some share of your \"marital property\" if he lived there and paid into it even if you didn't sell it...of course in that scenario you might also have claims on his assets too. It's really something that you need to get qualified legal advice on. \n\nBy the way I'm not saying this is right or wrong. I think personally he should walk away. Just alerting you to potential scenarios you should be prepared for.", "No I do not think so.", "Thank you for recognizing this. I even said I think he should let it go! I'm trying to help OP honestly \ud83d\ude02\n\nI get it though, Redditors want to protect someone they sympathize with", "He\u2019s tripping then, don\u2019t give him any money back.", "But did you have anything in writing??? \n\nSeriously, because depending on where you live he may have a legal case. If you have a lease or even emails/txts talking about him moving in and how payments would work - find them now!", "I don't think he should've lived there for free, that's why it's really a weird problem to address. I honestly don't know a way to figure what he should've paid, but half does feel too much considering if hypothetically you both earned the same amount the whole time then you'd have saved just as much but also came out way ahead because his contribution was your profit. Honestly I feel like the way that would make sense is a common law response where the initial investment and equity pre him moving in would naturally go to you, with the rest being split per your investment amounts, at least that feels fair with nobody being capitalized on.", "Do you honestly deep down think it's fair that you got to live with a partner you claim to care about until it's not convenient to what you want in life, and then you get to walk away being the only one to gain what is most likely a pretty significant amount of money off of his contributions to the home you funded together for the majority of the time you had it?", "All of the above advice depends on location. There are jurisdictions where OP's situation could qualify as common law marriage. \n\nPaying into a mortgage might be considered a tenancy situation or it might be considered contributing to joint \"marital\" assets. \n\n...*ask me how i know*...I mean don't...but... :/", "Its so weird.  Its like this isn't even saying the boyfriend is the good guy.  But sometimes there are legal things at play that people should be aware out.  And if he is legally entitled to some money, I also don't think it makes him an asshole for asking for it.", "Not all states in the US recognize common law marriage.", "Correct. *As per my initial comment*"]}
