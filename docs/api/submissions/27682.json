Where was bio dad or his family 25 years ago?\n\nAs I understand it, her father died in a car accident when she was very young.  She can't remember him or anything about him.  He was an only child and his parents died young.  I thing dad very early and mom before Cass was born.  I've never heard about any aunts, uncles or 2nd cousins.  Certainly none that stepped up or could be called on when she needed them as a teen.  She's still in touch with the ex boyfriend's parents that took her in.

It sounds like you and Cass have navigated divorce and coparenting really well, and you handled this situation about as well as anyone could. \n\nMy gut tells me that it was obviously really surprising, upsetting, and triggering for Cass, and that you were the person over whom she could exert some temporary control (\"control\" in the sense that she can redirect her anger toward you) because she couldn't control her mother coming out of left field. \n\nBe patient and compassionate.

I'd also see if they can or if they know someone who can help with making sure security of your homes is adequate and ways to reduce the public information available on all of you.", "Did she hire a private detective to find you and your ex?", "Oh.  So she really was alone when the shit went down with her mom and step dad.  What kind of parent kicks a teen out of their house.  And then, sits back as strangers step up?  I can see why she's not interested in what Grace has to say.", "Honestly, a super stand-up way to handle it.", "Yeah, it's far more easy to find people these days than ever. She may have hired a skip tracer or other investigator. At one point in my NC, I changed first & last name, & state, & my family still located me. It's creepy. Unless Cass has no online presence whatsoever (rare), where there's a will, there's a way. That mother's next step will be to contact Cass directly, either phone or in-person. Fundamentalist types are scary, bc they'll justify child kidnap, murder, etc., in the name of their \"God.\" Hopefully Cass can get some competent counseling to be able to set boundaries that are going to come at her real soon.", "It's a BS take. Cass will come around, she had a guttural response, triggered by trauma. Give her time, she'll apologize.", "What do you mean? You want them to guess why she's your ex?", "A person who willingly abandons her children to shack up with 2 randos and ends up seeing her children maybe a few days a month if they\u2019re lucky is a shit mother. she should get her emotions in check before going off on you.", "I was talking about it with my wife, who's know my ex for a long time (back in to the time when Cass and I were married) and in all that time, she never said a word to her about  her family, just the occasional mention of the family that stepped up for her. And then, bam, 25 years later, surprise.", "I have the ability to redirect UPS and I can see what is coming from USPS, but can't change it's destination.    When Cass comes up for air, she'll have to decide what she wants to do.  If it's UPS, I might be able to catch it.  I could also catch it. and put it in a bigger box with a do not contact us again note.  I'll do what ever she wants and I don't know how she could decide.  As another posted commented, it could be  cherished keep sake, perhaps from her father.  Of course I'm sure that it comes with strings attached.  I think if it was me, I'd leave her on read.  I would open it but stay no contact and never let her know if I even opened it.", "The only one more shocked about the call than Cass was me.\n\nWe certainly talked about it.  The parts I've shared are far from all, just enough to get the point across.  But we also hadn't talked about it in years.  The last time was probably when she was pregnant with our first child.  It was mostly centered around did our future child deserve to know all the grand parents sort of thing.  At the time I told her it was up to her.  I would handle them if she wanted our child to know the grand parents but she wasn't willing to forgive.  She landed on fuckem. ;)", "You seem like a good dude and are clearly trying your best. I wish you the best of luck dealing with this", "It's in the AITA break room.", "We'll see.  I suspect the update would either be boring or too personal.  I can justify this post as it's all about me.  Well, mostly about me.", "Interesting.  It might be a stretch, but it's an interesting idea.  I did check and basically because Cass and I are still living, any grand parents rights goes through us, so there's not much Grace could do legally.  Kicking your daughter out of the house because she was bi might have been OK in Graces social circle 25 years ago, but I doubt a judge would put up with that crap today.", "I plan to do some searching on my own to see what can be  found.  The interesting jump was to get my name.  She didn't even know we were married. our social media profiles are generally set to friends only but mybe there's a leak somewhere.  Or just a PI that is good at his job.\n\nI have a security system and Cass lives in a gated apartment complex.  You might be able to follow her to the gate, but by the way the place is laid out, you'd lose her before you could guess where she lived.  We both also have ring doorbell cameras, so if someone came to the door, we'd know.", "That's the best explanation, but it could be simpler than that.  It's also curious that a PI would be able to find me, but not Cass.", "It was 25 years ago.  I just have to wonder, with \"troubled\" teens, does nobody call CPS?", "Thanks for your insights.  I started the night wondering if I was the ahole, but really the questions is how doe we deal with what's probably coming.", "I think so too.  It will probably be a few days, knowing her.", "lol, no.  We're not going to play that game.  I'm saying that they can't guess why we divorced based on this post.  But if they have super powers, I wouldn't mind a lottery number.", "Yeah. I\u2019m an adult so had a lot of this kind of familial abandonment and it makes total sense to me that she\u2019d never talk about them and also freak tf out at this incident. \n\nI can tell you that I\u2019ve managed my childhood trauma pet fund in my own for decades, last fall my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and I\u2019ve been a mental health mess for the last year because it\u2019s like all my trauma just lit on fire. I\u2019m in therapy and working through it, but it\u2019s been a tough year, and I\u2019m survived by supportive and understanding people. \n\nI get her.", "Yes, that's normal for us NCers to never mention the ppl we're NC with. Her reaction at the news, while overkill from the outside, is in line with those of us who faced the same out of the blue contact. It rattles our whole world for a while.", "I'd like to push back at the auto-hangup. For all you knew it could have been gravely important info. that Cass might have been very upset had you simply hung up on before learning. This way, having listened, you know what the game plan is, & can prepare for this mother's future shenanigans, & cover all your bases. It's better you got that call than Cass.", "Thanks!", "Not only that but the creepy stalker contacting you to get to her and the kids. The creepy conversation where shes making demands instead of asking permission. With a no contact order you protect them kids from whatever grace has planned. I would imagine it'd be quite hard on the kids to introduce them to this stranger as their grandma that abused their mom....", "I looked some PIs where I am and many are former FBI agents, so they'd have experience and tools we wouldn't know about. What she knows about you is why I suggested a PI. Your security is good, but I was also thinking about when you leave your homes, kids in daycare/school (who can pick them up, making sure they're aware there may be a stranger try to contact your children, even reinforcing with your children not to talk to a stranger), things like that where you'd be more vulnerable. Her mom may do nothing, but for all of your safety, and your ex's mental health, it may be beneficial to have someone look at all of that to make sure you do everything you can to lessen any potential contact.", "My guess would be either she or a PI figured that Cass would eventually marry and searched marriage records to find your name. Marriages are considered public records, but you'd have to find the location where it happened to find the record. Databases today can make that easier. It's hard to cover all your tracks and so one of the online data brokers could very easily have a record for you.", "Yeah, update us if you want in the future. Meantime, were it me, I'd write down everything you can recall from that call, incl. date & time, as well as taking a photo if there's a way to prove that came in on your landline, if it shows up on a bill. I don't know how modern yet old tech works \ud83d\ude05", "She probably going to need to talk to a professional to work her way through this on.  I suspect that that package is a box full of guilt with some sort of issue that her mom thinks can wash 25 years away.", "Thanks for sharing.  I'm not taking it personal.", ">It's better you got that call than Cass.\n\nI totally agree.  I have armor.  Cass only has scars.", "> I would imagine it'd be quite hard on the kids to introduce them to this stranger as their grandma that abused their mom....\n\nIt would be quite the conversation.  The kids do know that Cass's father died when she was young, but they don't know anything about Grandma.  They know the family that took Cass in.  They send birthday cards an a gift at christmas.  When Cass talks about her family, she means them.", "It's a good suggestion.  A bit of counter-intellegence couldn't hurt and more importantly bring some peace of mind..\n\nSchool shouldn't be too much of a concern.  On my days, I pick the kids up directly and on Cass's days either I pickup and she gets them at my place, or she physically walks into the school, signs in, and checks them out.", "We certainly were not living like we were in WhitSec, but I've never met the lady and Cass never told her she had married.  I suppose it has slipped out somewhere.  I suppose a PI could start with highschool clasemates and just keep working up the ladder, eventually getting to someone who could put the PI closer.  I think he the PI got real close, her current friends would sound an alamr.  It sounds expensive.  I have no idea if her mom and step dad were rich or reglar assholes.", ">I don't know how modern yet old tech works\n\nAt least that's something I can be proactive with.", "Guarantee it will contain a childhood memento of great importance to your ex. Been there, had that done to me in a NC  sitch. The mother is reaching into every dark corner she can to get access to a daughter who has made it abundantly clear she isn't welcome in her life.", "That's good, & you're welcome. Best of luck.", "Then you have to protect that family dynamic. The best way is to set a serious boundary with serious consequences.", "Make sure to let the school know that no one except authorized people (and specify that does not include Grace or 'grandma') can get the kids.\n\nI'd offer to open the box and make an inventory list of the items if Cass is curious.  Yeah, probably nothing more than a boxful of guilt...", "As I told Grace, she can't bypass Cass for access.  I'm behind what she decides 100%.", "The school already has a list.  Right now, it's me, Cass, Jen, and my mother.   They'd have to make it past the front desk to get to the kids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhen it comes to the box, I'll do whatever she wants.  I can see her letting me see the contents and deciding if it was OK for her to see but I can see that driving her crazy too.", "Sometimes a parent will take away a prized toy and then forget or misinterpret what it means to the child. Something like that might be in the box.  If Cass isn't sentimental, I'd say look through it for her then burn it, telling her 'nothing of interest'.  Most people, I think would want to know.\n\nHave something ready to tell her mom.... like if it's mostly new stuff in the box, you can tell her 'the people at xxx appreciated the donation'.\n\nI think you're doing great."]}
