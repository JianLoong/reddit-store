Grace knew my name and address.\r  \n\r  \nI returned the call. It was my ex-wife\u2019s (Cass 41F) estranged mother (Grace F). We\u2019ve never met her or anyone on her side of the family.\r  \n\r  \nWhen Cass was a teen, she got caught having sex with her boyfriend. Grace and stepdad went into overdrive. Cass's next relationship was with a girl, and they kicked Cass out of the house. The ex-boyfriends\u2019 parents took her in, she finished high school, went to college, graduated, and started a successful career. We divorced but have joint custody of our two children. I have our children most of the time, but that's mostly about her work schedule, and we work together to get our children as much time with her as practical.\r  \n\r  \nSo, I'm on the phone with Grace, and she's talking 100MPH. I finally get across to her that Cass doesn't live here anymore, were divorced. She proceeds to insult Cass and me for that, but then realized that she's asking me for a favor and gets off the soap box. I tell her that I won't give her Cass\u2019s number or address, but I would tell Cass that she called and if Cass wanted to call her back, she would.\r  \n\r  \nThen she switches to the kids. She knows their names, but that\u2019s it. She wants to meet them. I told her that I understood, but that would only happen if Cass agreed. She insulted me and my manhood for letting a woman own me like that. Lol. I start winding down and saying I\u2019ll convey the message, but it's up to Cass if she wants to call. Before I can hang up, Grace says that she's sending me a package, and asks if I'll give it to Cass. If Cass won't take it, open it up and share it with \"her grand babies\". I said no guarantees, it would all but up to what Cass wanted to do.\r  \n\r  \nI texted Cass and asked if she would stop by so we could talk about something best talked about in person. If nothing else, I wanted her to hear the message.\r  \n\r  \nI pour her a glass of wine and I tell her about the call.\r  \n\r  \nCass was surprised that her mom had reached out. She was sure it was something terrible about our kids or Jen and I were moving. But no. It was her mom. We talked around and around the event with her hoping to glean one bit of info that I might have left out.\r  \n\r  \nAnd then she was pissed at me for taking the call, returning the call, and agreeing to accept the package. The fact that was a machine that took the call, that I didn't know I was calling her mom when I returned the call, or even given my address or permission to send a package didn't matter. I was the asshole.\r  \n\r  \nShe stormed off.\r  \n\r  \nI sent her a text asking if she was OK and telling her that I hadn't given Grace her contact details. I would simply ignore future calls (easy to do) and return the package when I got it, and for her to let me know if she wanted me to do anything else.\r  \n\r  \nApparently, I\u2019m still the asshole.", "created_utc": 1695749985, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16suh0k/aita_for_returning_a_call_from_my_estranged_ex/", "score": 24, "replies": ["NTA  \n\n\nShould have openly told Grace you were refusing the package, but other than that you did everything right.

At every turn, you rebuffed Grace and reiterated that it was Cass\u2019s decision to open contact, and you divulged nothing else about anyone\u2019s information.  \n\nWhat more, or less, could you have done?", "NTA for all the reasons you noted. She's pissed at her mom and taking it out on you which is unfortunately. I don't see how you did anything wrong here.", "No good deed goes unpunished.  She is taking her anger out on you for what her mother did to her.\n\nTell ex-wife this is between her and her mom.  Why is she allowing that woman to effect the decent co-parenting arrangement that you two have?  Then don't discuss it anymore with her.  If she brings it up, tell her to call Grace, you are out of it.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Shes probably having some serious flashbacks to her childhood and lashing out at everything.

Half an hour ago your estranged ex-mil was Karen.", "YTA for returning the unknown call, to the unknown caller, that has nothing to do with you. Are you one of these \"In case it is an emergency\" people?   \n\n\nI do not take messages, I do not answer unknown numbers, or callers.

I don't think there is more that you could have done and I it's nice to see you on being kind to your ex.  Not everyone can do that.  Even if she doesn't see it that way right now.  It may take a hot minute, but she'll process it all and see that you are not the problem.  Her issue is with her family.  She thought she had that problem shoved into closet, but the door just sprang open.\n\nThat said, better you than me.  I'd want to see what's in the box!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou said \"stepdad\".  Where was bio dad or his family 25 years ago?", "NTA you did the best you could", "If the package comes with a signature required, I doubt I'd have an opportunity to refuse it.  Even with.  Ive had sig required packages delivered and the sig was the driver hand writing \"customer accepted\".  \n\nMy promise to Cass is that I'll do what she wants with it.  I can send it back unopened. If she wants me to tell her mom something, I will.   If she wants to add a note, she could.", "It was a surprise that she knew my address.  Cass lives in a gated complex, so not likely that she'd be able to go there if she could even figure where it was.", "Happy cake day!", "I hope so.  I can't imagine being in her head right now.", "Cass thinks I could have hung up when I heard \"I'm Cass's mother\".", "It sounds to me like OP feels enough like a safe space that the ex can vent and still expect at least consideration, which she's getting, instead of erratic rejection, which she got from Mom.\n\nOP did exactly the right thing, but ex's issues with Mom go pretty deep and are still pretty raw.", "I'm hoping she'll cool down and redirect her anger at her family.  It may take a minute.  I've never seen her that upset.", "I'll help if I can.  It may not be possible.  For Cass, a ghost from almost 25 years ago just popped up out of nowhere.  I'm hopeful that she'll settle down", "That has got my wife (Jen)  kind of freaked out.  I'm doubting it was someone from my side of the family, they don't know or have ever met anyone besides Cass. Not only was Cass's family not invited to our wedding, they weren't informed either.  She been no contact with the whole lot since she was 18.\n\nThey'd have to figure out that she got married and changed her name to mine and were we lived (not were we got married).\n\nAnd then find me.  I'm pretty sure my number was unlisted, but it's a land line and it's been straight to the machine for a very long time.  I have a bundle that basically pays me to keep it.\n\nCass will be even harder to find.", "That's Cass's arguement.  I should have hung up the minute I knew who I was talking to. In my defense, I was surprised and her mom had a plan.  I think she knew that this was her one shot.", "I posted it about multiple times, but it got shot down for various violations.  The first was too many characters.  For the version you saw, it turns out that using the \"K\" name causes problems, so I changed it to Grace.  They are all made up names anyway.", "I returned a voice mail left on my land line's answering machine.  It's a phone that we will never answer.  It silently goes straight to voice mail because it's 99.99% spam. They knew my name and where I lived and said it was urgen to return the call.  I keep the land line for the odd occasion that I get calls like this.  It's rare that it's any thing but spam, but there have been some calls that we worth returning.  A recent one was the wife of my college roomate to tell me that he'd passed away.  The message was similar.", ">You said \"stepdad\".  Where was bio dad or his family 25 years ago?\n\nAs I understand it, her father died in a car accident when she was very young.  She can't remember him or anything about him.  He was an only child and his parents died young.  I thing dad very early and mom before Cass was born.  I've never heard about any aunts, uncles or 2nd cousins.  Certainly none that stepped up or could be called on when she needed them as a teen.  She's still in touch with the ex boyfriend's parents that took her in.  I think its a long shot, but they may have shared some information, but if they did, it was a smidge.  They certainly know her address and phone number and at least get a Christmas card.", "That's fair enough.", "NAH. \n\nMan, I cannot imagine the feelings Cass had come up when she found out her mom called you out of the blue. And if you also conveyed all the shit things her mom said that wood just confirm her mom\u2019s still a shit person and cause even more feelings. \n\nI don\u2019t think Cass is really mad at you. I think when she\u2019s had time to process, while you keep approaching her the way you have been (and kudos to you for being so respectful and understanding) she\u2019ll realize you didn\u2019t do anything wrong. But I think she just had an emotional explosion and she can\u2019t tell at her moon so it got redirected to you. \n\nNot ideal, but I don\u2019t blame her (and you don\u2019t seem to be). I think you did everything right and she needs time.", "We're divorced for a reason, but I still love her had feel for her situation, and of course she's the mother of my children.  What's bad for her usually impacts them. I think she can share anything with me and she has.  She knows the hot button issues to stay clear of, but her mom isn't one of them.  When the time is right, I'll encouage her to talk to a counselor.  There's also no rush, I think.  It just depends on what's in that package."]}
