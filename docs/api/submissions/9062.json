My MIL (F71) and I don't get along too well, but I've really pushed her buttons here lately.\n\nShe wanted me to practice a cultural tradition with her and her family, which is ancestral worship, but I'm a Christian who prefers to not go against my own personal beliefs. My husband is also a Christian himself, but still participates in traditions that he grew up with. I try to stay as respectful and neutral as possible, so I explained to the best of my abilities to my in-laws that I wasn't interested. My FIL didn't mind, but my MIL was really bothered by this. She told me that I'm in her house and because I'm in her house, I have to do as expected. She claims that joining their tradition won't hurt my faith in Christianity. Again, I stayed true to myself and declined. This is when my MIL got frustrated and shouted at me for being foolish and disrespectful. I stood my ground and said that yelling won't make me change my mind. She demanded that I go stand outside, so I did.\n\nI'm 100% sure I wasn't being disrespectful and I kept my calm. Just because I was married to her son doesn't mean I was interested in practicing any other traditions outside of my religion. He's different than I am when it comes to this.

I don\u2019t find these practices dissimilar from Dia de los Muertos or other ways that ancestors/late loved ones are remembered internationally. One of the main points is just remembering your ancestors and not letting them be forgotten. Even the praying can just be sharing thoughts, good vibes, or nothing really at all. Most of my younger family members are simply present but don\u2019t participate. \n\nHave you and your husband had conversations about how to parse out these differences, especially as you\u2019re both Christian? Did you show curiosity and help teach your kids how to participate even if you didn\u2019t?

And in the 1st example, Christians don\u2019t pray to deceased ancestors or believe that ancestors can look after them. \n  \n  \nThis seems to be a little more than just paying respects. Maybe OP can come back to clarify.

As a fellow Christian, I think you were quite considerate, and I like how you weren't bullied into going along with it. It's good that you explained that it is YOUR faith, not your husband's that would be affected here. You even listened to her demand for 'space' when she told you to go outside! Sadly, if people refuse to understand, then that is on them.

She told me that I'm in her house and because I'm in her house, I have to do as expected. She claims that joining their tradition won't hurt my faith in Christianity. Again, I stayed true to myself and declined. This is when my MIL got frustrated and shouted at me for being foolish and disrespectful. I stood my ground and said that yelling won't make me change my mind. She demanded that I go stand outside, so I did.\n\nI'm 100% sure I wasn't being disrespectful and I kept my calm.

So she was forced to actively participate or leave and she chose the latter. I find people who aren\u2019t religious (like myself) are more flexible about these things because in the end it doesn\u2019t mean anything, it\u2019s just words and gestures and who cares if they do it, but people with active beliefs have lines they don\u2019t want to cross, you know? Like it\u2019s easier for an atheist to participate in these things than a religious person with a different belief because they actually feel they\u2019re committing blasphemy while we just think it\u2019s a meaningless ceremony."]}
