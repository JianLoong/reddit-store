An after begging for the past 5 years to get braces my dad finally caved in and agreed to make a appointment with my dentist to get a referral to the orthodontist and so far it\u2019s been going great. Until a week ago when I was coming home from a orthodontist appointment, my aunt randomly decides to call my mom I\u2019m guessing to check up on her, n basically to sum it up my aunt asked my mom what she was doing my mom replied with \u201cjust taking (me) home from her orthodontist appointment\u201c and immediately my aunt went silent for a second and went on to ask if it was for braces. Obviously my mom says yes and goes on to explain how they put in spacers and I\u2019ll be going back in a week to get my braces on etc, that\u2019s when she started to get a little bit frustrated. and asked my mom why wouldn\u2019t she have consulted her considering she can\u2019t afford dental insurance for my cousin. she then basically went on to talk about how that could affect my cousin, and also how I could possibly make him insecure that I have braces and he doesn\u2019t. and went on to suggest if I was even going to get the braces on I should include him in my experience considering he won\u2019t be able to get braces. My mom obviously starts to get aggravated and asked her where did she find the audacity to say all of that and to sum it up they basically argued for a majority of the car ride home till my mom hung up. Since then my entire moms side of the family have been calling/texting my mom calling her an asshole for getting me braces knowing my aunt can\u2019t afford dental insurance for my cousin. Which is weird considering she\u2019s always given him everything he could possibly ever want, she literally buys him whatever he wants. anyways I really just don\u2019t get what this whole family feud is about. Because I generally need braces and even my dentist agrees with that (noted I really can\u2019t even sleep with my mouth closed at night because my overbite is so bad) so obviously it\u2019s not really a cosmetic thing for me. The cosmetic part it\u2019s obviously a plus though.

Both sides of my family, finances vary from typical blue collar to upper middle class, and not all of my cousins had braces.  My sister and I both needed them - small, crowded mouths meant teeth got turned funny and needed correcting. I\u2019m kinda puzzled about how you\u2019d \u201cinclude your cousin in the experience\u201d even if you wanted to.

First, what you do has zero bearing on your cousin, unless your Aunt makes it a big deal. Second, wtf is her problem? It\u2019s literally none of her business what your spends their money on.
