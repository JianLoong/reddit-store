{"id": 14074, "submission_id": "12ctafd", "title": "WIBTA for not adopting my ex's older daughter when I said I would?", "selftext": "After my ex and I had our daughter, Emily, we decided to talk to the other kids about me legally adopting my ex's two older kids (Alex and Carter). Carter was really into the idea, but Alex was not. So we put it off. A couple years later Carter brought it up and he really wanted me to adopt him. So we decided that I would adopt Carter and told Alex that if she ever changed her mind I would adopt her too.\n\nAfter Carter\u2019s adoption was finalized things went downhill. Alex started acting out and would yell and get argumentative. She would hide, throw out, and destroy my things and blamed it on me being careless or on our younger children. The worst part was her being mean to Carter and Emily. I caught her often calling Carter stupid and otherwise putting him down. She would unplug his games and his saves kept getting deleted. She would completely ignore Emily to the point that she would walk through whatever she was playing with and say she didn't see her there. She would only act this way when my ex wasn\u2019t around and he didn't believe me. He refused to consider getting her into therapy or doing family therapy.\n\nIt got progressively worse over the years. Realizing that nothing was going to change and my kids were going to continue to live with their sister bullying them I decided to end things. That was last year and we have just know gotten our divorce finalized. I have primary custody of Carter (who is now 13) and Emily (who is now 6).\u00a0\n\nAlex (who is now 16) was at my place for the first time a few weeks ago. She came with her dad when he was picking up Carter and Emily for the day.\u00a0Since then she has come over every time my ex has. The last time she was over she said she wanted me to adopt her now.  After everything that happened I didn't think that was a good idea, so I said no. My ex interjected and talked about how back when I adopted Carter I had promised to adopt Alex if she changed her mind.\n\nI didn't want to get into it with Carter and Emily right there so I told them we could talk about this some other time and had them leave.  Truthfully I feel like her motivation to have me adopt her is just based on me having more money than her dad. I don't think she realized this earlier because she was never at my house before. Since the first time she was over she made several comments on how big my house is and how her dad can't afford this or that. I do know that my ex has been having a lot of money problems recently too. \n\nThe part that makes me feel conflicted is that I have learned that Alex has been nicer to Carter and Emily since she has been over. So  If I say no to her I'm worried about her being mean to them again. Carter is suspicious about how she's acting and says she's being weird, but I know Emily would be really sad if Alex started ignoring her again. Still I don't want to be legally responsible for a kid that I'm pretty is only pretending to like me and being nice because she wants things from me.", "created_utc": 1680719082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ctafd/wibta_for_not_adopting_my_exs_older_daughter_when/", "score": 1987, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You adopted Carter when you were with your ex - as a family.\n\nYou split up, and are not a family any longer.\n\nYou are under no obligation to adopt a child who is no longer part of your family. Why would you take on legal responsibility for someone else's kid **when you are no longer in a relationship with their parent?**\n\nI would say no. The offer of adoption ended when your relationship did. And Alex chose which potential parent she wanted to live with. She is 16, and old enough to learn that decisions have consequences. I'm sure that if you were all still a family, adoption would still be on the table. But you aren't, and it's not.", "NTA\n\nShe's mistreated you and the younger kids for a long time. You were still married to her Dad when you made that promise, you aren't anymore. There's no point in being nice to someone who has proven they don't give a shit about you. Once you have adopted her you can't go back and she probably knows that. I'm pretty sure her good behaviour would change really fast and the only thing that would happen is she'd demand money all the time. She's 16, she can learn a lesson about actions and consequences.\n\nPlease protect your younger kids from her.

She is 16yo, so that means she was a teen and going terrible things to her siblings.   Also she is your ex's kid, there is no reason for you to adopt her.   I hope her Dad got her therapy when she was acting out because she sure needs it.\n\nSorry ex's ship sailed when he did not do much to stop her bad behavior. His money issues are his to deal with.", "NTA. \n\nStep-child adoptions are a thing, but are former step-child adoptions even entertained in court?

If you're not open to it at this point, that's perfectly fair - just don't lead her on in that case.", "NTA \n\nIf and i mean BIG if you decide to go through with this before starting down the legal path, therapy/counseling is a non negotiable must that has to happen.

Tell her you are worried that based on prior behavior she will change back. That you will treat her just as you do the others but if her behavior goes back to where she is hurting her siblings she is no longer welcome to stay. This way she remains motivated to be kind to them and it could be a win for everyone.", "There's a pretty easy way to resolve this. Give her the opportunity to show she wants to be a part of your family before you will agree to adopt her. \n\nRefusing outright would make you an asshole. She's a kid who was going through a lot of changes. It's fairly common for the older sibling who remembers their other parent better to be more resistant to blending families.

I would like to know what happened to her mother.", "I'm of two minds on this one.\n\nYou are divorced, so adopting her now does feel a little strange, and her actions are a little suspicious. But breaking promises, especially to kids, is asshole behavior.\n\nAlso, I don't think you're reading this situation fully. Her actions, picking on her brother after he got adopted, ignoring the shared child, these actions scream jealousy. There's a disconnect here. To me, this whole thing reads... Wrong. Did their mother die, or abandon them? Why was there a thing about you legally adopting them at all? The way this reads feels like really important stuff is left out. Like, maybe this girl lost her mother, and felt like letting you adopt her was some sort of massive betrayal, so she said no to it... But then her brother had a full mom in you, the shared sister had a full mom in you, and only SHE didn't. So she started acting out, unable to deal with, or even understand, how she was feeling... And now she's gotten a little older, and sees what they have, she's more capable of coping with the feelings and wants you to be her mom too, because she always loved you and felt left out and wants to fix it...\n\nIt's really hard to say anything here, because it just feels like there's something really important absent in this. I can wholly understand you being suspicious, and wanting to safely test the waters, but I think you need to genuinely understand her motives before you reject her.", "ESH - why did you and your ex let that behavior go for years? it sounds like she needed some kind of anger management or therapy", "ESH\n\nYou're talking about Alex like she is a grown adult who had all this malicious intent against you... She was 10-11 years old when this behavior started - and she's still only 16! \n\nIt sounds like Alex's biological parents have failed her in a number of ways, and it's unfortunate that instead of having a healthy relationship with you, this is just another trauma in her life.", "YTA.

Do you truly view her as family and want to take on a mom role in her life?\n\nMaybe I\u2019m biased from my own experiences, but I could see Alex maybe feeling like she lacks security and a mother figure in her life. Since you seemed to have raised her through some difficult tween-teenage years, maybe she does view you as a safe person and wants to make amends.\n\nSometimes teenagers act out, especially if they\u2019ve had an unstable family life. Based on your post I think it\u2019s important to think about Alex\u2019s perspective and not jump to conclusions based on the shitty things she\u2019s done as a child that could be hurting inside.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously your right to make the decision to adopt and it\u2019s fair for you to say no. If there\u2019s a glimmer of hope that maybe what I said is true or resonates with you, you can always think about the decision and let Alex prove to you that she views you as family and not a financial asset.\n\n**TL;DR take time in your decision. There\u2019s not enough info about Alex\u2019s behavior and your relationship to warrant an asshole/not the asshole judgement (since your decision seems to be stemming from her previous actions).

Best of luck and I wish peace for you and the kids.", "Definitely have it in a neutral place.  This girl is manipulative, so be very wary of her.", "Yep, that exactly fits my guess.\n\nAgain, I don't disagree with you being suspicious and cautious at all, there's a lot of history here. But I think you should spend some time with her, and try to figure out how she's really feeling and what's behind her changing her mind. It's easy to assume bad intentions, humans have a severe negativity bias as a species, but reality is much more nuanced than that.\n\nI've studied psych with an emphasis in developmental psychology, neuroscience, and psychology of emotion, but I am NOT a certified clinical or counselling psychologist, and so I'm not going to give anything that can even pose as counselling advice here, this is just educated advice from a random dad on the interwebz, but I really think you should spend some time with her, one on one, and talk through some of this stuff. Ask her about her past behaviors, honestly explain they are making you somewhat uneasy about this situation, and explain that if it's going to happen you are going to have to rebuild trust and a relationship first. Maybe even book some sessions of family counselling with a professional, so you have a third party to arbitrate things. It's really easy for fragile teens (and all teens in general, because they are all fragile at some level in that stage of development) to take things really wrong and break. An independent, neutral third party to bridge some misunderstandings for you both can help immensely.\n\nJust because this seems like a sudden about face to you doesn't mean it's not genuine... But just because she might genuinely have changed doesn't mean you should ignore and disregard the past actions and put yourself and your other children at risk. Do what feels right for you and them, safely... But I don't think you should just reject her out of hand over her past actions without fully understanding her first. You may be risking damaging her emotionally even more, and yourself missing out on a lifelong loving relationship with her in doing so.\n\nEdit: Adding a verdict after the extra info - IMO this is a NAH.", "You are holding her accountable for behavior that you didn't correct while you were parenting her. You bear some responsibility and culpability for the way her life has turned out. \n\nHer biological parents are also to blame - but you've failed her repeatedly.", "Can't remember the last time I've been so convinced about my judgement. I'll gladly put all my karma on the line for this one.\n\nShe made a promise to a child to be their parent. Kids don't just start bullying acting out without reason, Alex clearly was going through some stuff and it's not hard to figure out what, since it started right after Carter was adopted.\nIf OP adopts and gets some degree of custody she can get Alex the help she has needed for a long time, that her ex rejected.\n\nYou don't just get to just keep the \"easy\" kids and discard the \"hard\" one. It's heartless.", "She\u2019s only 2 years away from being an adult. I imagine the adoption process takes time anyways. Although I wouldn\u2019t suggest OP adopt her even if it is possible. She definitely sounds like she has ulterior motives for wanting this and she hasn\u2019t yet proven herself around her younger siblings.", "I tried to, but my ex didn't believe she was doing anything so when I tried for example taking away electronics he would just give them back to her.", "No, the kid ONLY wants the adoption now because OP has money and her Dad doesn't.", "\"Close enough\" doesn't usually work with legal requirements. You can't begin an adult adoption in any state (as far as I know) as a minor. So, not only is this a bad idea for many reasons, it may be practically impossible anyway.", "Then definitely NTA. Your ex enabled her awful behavior and it negatively impacted your other two kids. How she chooses to treat her siblings is on her alone now since she is not a little kid. If Carter is suspicious about it then he\u2019s probably spot on with what he\u2019s thinking. I\u2019ll advise you not to adopt her because you yourself do not want that responsibility. It\u2019s not gonna be good for you and if she mistreats her sibling again because of it then you will have made the right choice. Your youngest may be upset that Alex ignores her again but that will all be up to Alex and her father to fix that type of behavior.", "She is 16. She is old enough to understand that her previous behavior is making you wary. If you are considering this, there are several conditions you should require. This discussion should be had between just the two of you.\n\nShe needs to acknowledge the harm she has previously done. She needs to be able to provide a sincere apology. She needs to go to counselling, both individually and then eventually with her siblings. She needs to hear the hurt and damage she has caused to her siblings from their perspective. The two of you need to have some counselling sessions to discuss how she hurt you and your children, and how she needs to show she can behave kindly and follow your rules as her parent before she becomes your child. You and your ex need to also have some mediated sessions to ensure that he is not going to undermine your parenting going forward.\n\nThis is a lot of work for this 16 year old. You are NTA if you do not adopt her. You need to ask yourself if you would want to if she did the work. If you would want to, then lay out the work she will need to do to earn her siblings agreement and your trust. And don't forget the requirement to have your ex admit he f-ed up, there was something wrong, and he enabled it. If he keeps undermining, it will never work.", "YWNBTA but I'd honestly suggest family therapy to see if everyone can come to an agreement; it could be any reason as to why she's choosing now (regret, loneliness, force, deception, etc). I know the damage she caused is done but it's not too late to foster a relationship with her without adopting her. She's extending an olive branch & you have every right to be cautious or refuse it with her past behavior.", "NTA\n\nShe wants the adoption because her life isn't better now that she got her wish.", "INFO: Does your ex hate his kids? Like how did you end up with primary custody of his biological son? and now he also wants you to take custody of his daughter too?", "Your first thoughts are correct: this child is unstable and angry and capable of anything.\n\nProtect your kids and DO NOT GET INVOLVED WITH HER.\n\nIf you're worried about what she might do when your ex has them. withhold them from him and go to court to have his custody rescinded because of the danger to your kids.", "NTA. Especially because I would bet she will star being mean again to them once you adopt her, she clearly manipulative and needs counseling.", "Those kids know she is a bully. There is no way to save that. Don't adopt her. She doesn't deserve it nor is she really your child. Carter is. Loved you like a parent. She just wants to use you", "NTA. Why would you adopt her now? Especially when you are no longer together with their parent and they were a big part of the reason you got divorced.", "NTA. Maybe a private chat with your ex to find out what is really happening?  Maybe \u201csomething \u201c is happening, he\u2019s quite sick and Alex needs a parent.  Maybe he is guilting Alex bc \u201cshe destroyed his relationships with you and the other kids \u201c.  If something is going on , do insist on family counseling before making any more changes.", "NTA and Carter and Emily should get a veto if you, ex, and Alex talk it over later and want to do it.", "NTA, but I\u2019ll give you something to think about.  I taught middle & high school kids for 34 years. I watched quite a few girls behave in really horrific ways for years until their sophomore year of high school (don\u2019t even get me started on how mean girls can be ages 11-16\u2013boys are a different discussion). Anyway, it\u2019s as if a magic switch was flipped in the middle of their sophomore year and they started to turn into decent human beings.  Some of my favorite former students were hellions in middle school and then turned it around in high school.  If I hadn\u2019t been willing to give them a second chance when they got older, I\u2019d have missed out on some pretty amazing kids.\n\nYou\u2019ve expressed concerns about Alex\u2019s motivation for suddenly wanting to be adopted and you have every right to be suspicious.  Here\u2019s how you find out whether or not she\u2019s really changed:\n\nTell her you are not going to adopt her since you\u2019re no longer married to her dad.  Fully explain the logistics of that and don\u2019t bring up her previous behavior unless she does.  Try to make it about the technicalities.  See how she responds.  If she gets angry, don\u2019t worry\u2014that\u2019s to be expected.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll argue. Calmly refute her arguments, then end the discussion.  She may be abusive to you.  Expect it and don\u2019t respond in kind (and try not to hold it against her as she\u2019s still young and her first response may not be her final response).

How does she treat you once the initial disappointment passes?  Give her a couple of months to adjust to the news and then check in with your kids to see what\u2019s happening behind the scenes. THAT\u2019S what will inform your next move.  If she is abusive, your gut was right.  If she treats everyone with respect and reestablishes a positive relationship with you, managing her disappointment in mature ways once she\u2019s had a chance to process, you could consider adopting her later, as a purely symbolic gesture, seeing as she is your kids\u2019 sibling.  Or not.  That\u2019s entirely up to you, seeing as she did a pretty good job burning bridges.  It could be a nice 18th birthday present, after she\u2019s had ample time to prove with her actions that she deserves the gesture.\n\nOnly time will tell if Alex is going to be a decent human being.

OP is acting way too butthurt over this kid's confused feelings over a new parent and normal teenage rebellion/sibling rivalry. Grow the fuck up.\n\nEdit: You don't promise things to kids and take them back later. This is so shitty and neglectful. This whole post screams of someone who is playing house with someone else's family. My opinion is that you should turn over custody of all 3 kids, begin paying child support, and commit to never having children again.", "NTA! You're not even with her Dad anymore, because of her. She just wants to be closer to your stuff. It's really weird that your ex would want this, but maybe he is going for child support from you for her? Or to pull you back into a relationship, since he's struggling?\n\nIt's terrible that Alex and her father stressed your family to a breaking point, but what's done is done. She is almost an adult. If she chooses to do so at 18, she can have a whole new relationship with you then. \n\nProtect your assets, BTW.", "NTA \n\nYou are no longer married to him or her stepmom. You offered to adopt her many times and she said no. Now that she clearly only wants your money. She wants to be adopted. Imagine if you did adopt her. She will still treat her siblings horribly. She did before. She will go back to that. This way they will be with you and able to get away from that. Where if you did adopt her they won\u2019t have that. She is seeing that the grass is greener on your side.", "NTA.\nNot sure the courts would accept you adopting a child that is your ex's when there is no medical necessity to  (i.e. he is very sick and won't be able to care for her soon).\nYou adopted your child a long time ago and since Carter doesn't want you to it seems I would go based off their feelings. Alex is a bully and trying to play you. They didn't want to see you until they saw how nice your home was by chance", "NTA - Maybe see if she is interested in seeing a therapist with you to work through why she was so mean earlier?", "NTA. Good god why would you even consider this. Don\u2019t do it!\ud83d\ude33 that kid caused your divorce! She wants money and stuff. She\u2019s not your responsibility and be damn glad of it", "NTA, but at the same time, maybe give her a chance to prove she is serious.  That means she goes into therapy, individual, and family with you and her siblings.  She takes responsibility for her actions against you three, and works to make amends, honestly.  Start with one outing as a family (minus the ex) once or twice a month.  If she asks, maybe one on one time with you, once a month.  Don't let her just barrell her way into all of your lives.  Also don't give her any money of she asks.  Watch her behavior, and how committed she really is then decide.", "You do realize she's being nice because she wants something right? And didn't you end your marriage because she was mean? So now that you are divorced you are concerned about something that was already happening? As JoJo said \"too little too late\" it would be weird to adopt her now, you are divorced. NTA", "NTA. Don't do it. She will be treating you like a bank. Tell them you can't adopt someone who was abusive to your kids and that her desire to be adopted now makes no sense. And stop her from coming to your house.", "NTA this child broke a trust you had in her when she treated her siblings so atrociously making you feel that they were unsafe in her presence. The fact that her brother your son says her acting nice is suspicious is another red flag. Your first instincts was no leave at that for now, offer to go to counseling with her and your other two children. If she turns it down your instincts that her motives weren't pure are right. Take your time don't rush to adopt because she & your ex are attempting emotional blackmail on a promise made prior to Alex's actions contributing to break down of the marriage. Be open & honest about how her actions hurt that therapy is needed to get past that hurt. Don't rush it say 2 years from now after therapy you have no hesitations adopt her. But do not adopt her when you feel the way you feel right now!", "NTA. Alex controlled your marriage. Don\u2019t let her control your divorce too. The offer for adoption was for when you were still married to your ex. If she\u2019s not nice to your kids then as the primary custodial parent, you have a say in your ex\u2019s visitation. That\u2019s the leverage you have over him to parent his eldest. Alex doesn\u2019t need to be super nice and bend over for her siblings but if she\u2019s outright hostile then your ex only gets supervised visits. Alex is 16. She can be left alone at your ex\u2019s house for half a day or so. It\u2019s sad that Carter is suspicious and Alex acting nice weirds him out. It speaks volumes about the abuse he\u2019s suffered at her hands over the years. Emily might be sad if Alex ignores her again but if that relationship is based on how much money you\u2019re shelling out, how long will you keep the gravy train running so Emily is happy? If Alex is in it solely for the money, the day you stop paying is the day she breaks Emily\u2019s heart. Better to rip that bandaid off ASAP so Emily can heal and move on.", "NTA, and I also think her behavior is suspicious. Especially since it seems she never received any therapy or help for what she was going through a few years ago. If you still want to foster a good relationship with her and her siblings, you could offer for her to stay over some weekends and see how long she maintains this new better attitude. Most people can only hide their true feelings/intentions for a few months. It's definitely way too soon to even consider adoption though.", "NTA and I have a feeling she'll go right back to being mean to Carter and Emily even if you say yes, because by then she'll have gotten what she wants, so she won't \"need\" to be nice to them anymore.", "NTA!", "NTA, you are no longer married to her father.  Depending on where you live you might not be able to.  Does she really want to be adopted by you or is she tired of living with just her dad. Not only is the house smaller and she is not getting this is there other reasons as well.  Is she looking for a dinner cooked every night and someone that does the laundry.", "NTA, don't teach Alex that manipulation and this kind of opportunism are rewarded.\n\nAlex already showed how deceptive they can be with the whole acting out of control but hiding it when dad was around.  Now they want to use you for better quality of life.  \n\nI know it's going to suck for the other kids if Alex doesn't get their way so drops the nice act, but long term it would suck way more for them to have an enabled manipulator who grows into a bigger manipulator and maybe even screws them over or uses them deep into the future.", "NTA  \nFrom my perspective this situation is complicated, but I do not think you are under any obligation to adopt her now the marriage is over. It really seems odd that your ex would even suggest it and want you to adopt her, to me it sounds like they are ones gold digging through Alex.  \nI will say though her behavioural issues may have stemmed from the loss of her mother and she didn't process it well at all and burned bridges with anyone who supported the idea of moving on after loss. She may have felt pretty betrayed by her sibling and your biological daughter. She was a child when that happened and is now a hormonal teenager. I wouldn't paint her as evil as many people here do, she's just a kid who's not coped well life and has developed a behavioural issue that needed/needs to be addressed. But that's not your problem to address anymore.   \nIf I was in your position, I wouldn't ostracise her for what she's done, but I wouldn't adopt her either, I would let her know that she is welcome to stay with you anytime and if she doesn't take that offer or reverts back to her bullying behaviour, then you know she's been convinced to take your money and its time for her to go home and let Carter and Emily decide on their own if they want a relationship with her.", "Nta ...you ended your marriage because of the kid and now that they can't afford nice things they want to be adopted", "NTA. Please, please don\u2019t adopt her. Your house is a safe place for Carter and Emily. That shouldn\u2019t be threatened or invaded by their horrible older sister.", "NTA! Alex has had 6 years to change her mind.  She waited until you were divorced from her father to decide she wants to be adopted by you.  Did she say she wants to spend more time with you and her siblings or that she regrets her behavior?  Or did she just say that she wants to be adopted now.  Whole thing sounds weird, especially since dad is into the idea.", "Check back in a few years and see how it plays out. Time will tell.", "NTA don\u2019t do it. Whatever her ulterior motives are, it\u2019s not to benefit anyone but herself. Why would you adopt her now when you\u2019re no longer family? The only connection she has to you is her siblings but you\u2019re no longer her stepmother. Why would you be responsible for her? Also, the fact that you got primary custody of a child who isn\u2019t biologically yours says a lot about his father. He ignored her behavior for years and continues to do so.", "Her mom and dad can't afford to pay her university tuition in a couple of years so she needs to find someone who can afford it and kiss their ass. She also probably wants a car. Don't fall for it. Stand strong and NTA", "I\u2019m just glad Carter has you protecting him", "NTA\n\nIt just sounds strange. I would wonder if your ex and Alex figure that if you adopt her, you can all let \"bygones be bygones\" and be one big happy family again. And then his money problems go away. Or, you adopt her and she stays with him, allowing him to ask for child support. Yeah, no. It makes no sense to adopt her now.", "NTA, the adaption was part of the relationship with your ex. When that ended, so did the offer to adopt.", "NTA", "NTA that ship has sailed I do not think you can trust her. She is going to be mean to them again whether you adopt her or not.", "I would be like do you not realize you\u2019re the reason me and your dad are divorced lmao why on earth would I adopt you? I would 100% have zero relationship with someone else\u2019s kid who ruined my marriage.", "Obviously NTA and her being nice is only temporary anyway. Maybe she\u2019s grasping at straws but who cares. She was the primary reason for the divorce in the first place. Now there is literally no basis for adoption. As if she would be grateful and start treating you all nicely if you did it. LMAO\n\nEdit to add, she would also be 100% likely to take any and all possible inheritance from you, away from Carter and Emily. I\u2019d guarantee it since she spent her childhood and a big chunk of theirs bullying them. This would give her extra legal means to do so for the rest of your and their lives. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA. She literally ruined your marriage. Her own brother sees through her. Do not trust this. She just wants the privileges of you having more money. She will drop the act and go back to abusing your kids", "NTA, that shipped sailed. If you were still with your ex it would make sense to complete your family. But, Alex changing her mind now doesn\u2019t make sense. She did not see you as a mom when you were literally living with her in the mom roll, but sees you as a mom now that you have moved out of the shared family home into a larger home of your own.", "Wtf are with these replies?! She\u2019s 16. This isn\u2019t some malicious Machiavellian plan she\u2019s been masterminding. She\u2019s clearly just a messed up kid.\n\nThe adoption isn\u2019t about money or a piece of paper - it\u2019s about security and belonging and knowing she\u2019s wanted. What happened with her birth mom? I\u2019d put money on there being some trauma for Alex there.\n\nOP, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA here because you\u2019re in a really tough position. NAH. But it doesn\u2019t sound like Alex was really old enough to make the decision about adoption when it was given to her - that\u2019s a decision for adults, and way too much responsibility to give to a kid. \n\nClearly seeing her brother get adopted was triggering for her, and whatever she was going through then started to come out in her problematic behaviours. Especially to her siblings, who *did* have two parents. See the big red flag there?\n\nI know it\u2019s hard to separate blame from behaviour but all that we know about child psychology tells us that this acting out is a desperate expression of some big unmet needs. You were absolutely right to insist on therapy and it\u2019s awful that she wasn\u2019t given it. It\u2019s good that she has you in her life.\n\nShe\u2019s a little older now, but her problems won\u2019t have gone away. This is a super delicate situation because it\u2019s likely that asking for the adoption was really hard for her, and being rejected is going to be incredibly triggering again. Because parental love is supposed to be unconditional, right? It\u2019s not meant to be *\u201cwell I WAS willing to be your mom when you were nicer but now you\u2019re not and we got divorced so I don\u2019t want you any more. Oh, but I\u2019m keeping your siblings as mine.\u201d Being a mom isn\u2019t an opt-outable job. \nAnd I know that\u2019s *not* what you\u2019re saying or choosing here, but you can see how it\u2019s going to feel that way to her.\n\nMy advice would be to offer to take her out for some 1 on 1 girl time to talk. Show her you love her. Make it clear that you\u2019re always going to be in her life and that you\u2019re excited to have an adult relationship with her going ahead. Give her the sense of security and belonging regardless, and she might stop wanting the adoption thing so much.", "What is her college application situation? Sounds suspicious like maybe she needs money for school.", "NTA\n\nYou divorced your husband and split your family because she was so adamantly against being adopted and you being a mother figure in anyone\u2019s life. Now that she feels let out she wants to be adopted? She doesn\u2019t want a family. She wants your stuff. From what you described, her behavior hasn\u2019t changed other than acknowledging your son and daughter. She hasn\u2019t apologized. She hasn\u2019t sat done with you to discuss why things have changed with her. She hasn\u2019t even made real efforts to get along with your kids other than not bullying them. She immediately went to ok you can adopt me like you\u2019re doing her a favor. This sounds like a ploy for your husband to get back with you and for her to benefit from your money. I\u2019m sure once she moves in, she\u2019ll treat your children poorly when you aren\u2019t around. Your ex had a chance to make things work and he chose to ignore your concerns, not believe you, and refuse therapy. \n\nTell her to get therapy or counseling first and you two will revisit it again.", "NTA, however I understand your concerns.  What if you expressed that you have concerns and would want to get family counseling first before making a decision.  I think family counseling is a good idea whether you adopt or not, because they are all siblings.  And you have over a year before you have to make a final decision", "Alex may very well go back to being mean even if she is adopted. If she is not sincere in regretting her behavior, she will go back to being mean to her siblings once she gets the adoption she wants.

Don\u2019t do this unless you want to do it now.", "NTA don\u2019t do it, if Alex wants that relationship, you can take baby steps. I wouldn\u2019t say be closed to it but maybe make sure she is getting therapy.", "I'm going against the grain here, but YTA. You divorce spouses, not children. I helped my Ex fianc\u00e9 raise his little brother (their Mom was/is an opiate addict) from the time he was 13 to 19. It was hard. As you can imagine, he wasn't used to adults giving a shit and setting rules and boundaries. I'd still help him to this day if he needed me.\n\nEven my alcoholic common law step daddy was kinder to me after he and my Mom split.

Find out their line of thoughts and perhaps share your own thoughts.", "NTA and maybe it\u2019s a jerk move but I would say that you would consider adoption after a year of family and individual therapy with Alex to make sure it was the best thing for her. Even if you don\u2019t want to adopt now she\u2019s still your kids older sister and therapy to work through those relationships will only be beneficial.", "NTA, but with a big caveat. If Alex started acting out immediately after Carter's adoption, it seems pretty likely she was alienated by being left out of the adoption process. Seems like both you and the ex were trying to be considerate of her feelings, but there are some years of resentment and left-out feelings to work through, even if she couldn't admit that she might have wanted to be adopted, too. \n\nI agree with all of the posters saying that Alex needs therapy, but it sounds like she might need a bit of empathy, too,", "NTA\n\nThink about it. Once you adopt her, she comes to live with you, then she re-starts her bullying bc she has gotten what she has wanted .\n\nYou will be removing your children\u2019s SAFE SPACE if you fall for this trap. Of course your ex wants the adoption to go ahead, he will come out of it financially better than he is now. \n\nHer behaviour will revert back once you say no (which proves she was faking it) AND once you say yes. This is a lose, lose situation. \n\nDon\u2019t do it.", "NTA. Listen to your intuition, if it feels wrong, it probably is wrong.", "Alex is still a kid, and was young when you and your ex joined families, so I'll give a bit of grace here...\n\nI think the first step would be \"you're welcome to come over sometimes during your siblings visitation and we'll work on an actual relationship.\" Second step, if you're even considering what will be close to, if not fully, an adult adoption would be therapy. \n\nYour marriage ended because of your ex's unfortunately to address Alex's behavior. Ultimately, you protected your children from Alex's behavior. Stopping now would be counterproductive to the actions you've already taken. \n\nYou've not lived with Alex since the split, so you don't know if the behavior has been masked, lessened, or stopped altogether. She's not tormenting your younger children anymore, which is good - but is she kind and loving? \n\nWas she a hurt kid or is she a manipulative teen/young adult? Hard to tell if you've not spent time with her. Also hard to tell if you don't have a third party to help you diffuse hurt feelings and current motivations.\n\nPast promises to a now broken situation don't count, I think. \"I will adopt you when you're ready\" can be off the table for a family unit that no longer exists, but \"I'm here for you (emotionally) if you want an actual relationship\" can still be possible. \n\nNTA", "Would she be able to adopt? You usually have to be married. At least that was my experience. I had to be married for a minimum of 6 months before I could adopt my son.", "I mean, even if she had honestly and sincerely changed her mind... that door is closed now. The offer for adoption was because OP was in a relationship with her dad, that Alex herself managed to destroy. Things have consequences.", "Considering I (29M) can I adopt my best friend (29F) if I wanted to so yes it's perfectly fine.", "Right??? I'm surprised OP let her in the house after the first time. I don't want my ex's abusive child snooping. Especially since Carter is leary", "THIS", "I mean if your real mom isn't dead then it's actually pretty hard for your \"consequence\" for acting out as a young teen to be permanent abandonment by a parent (or someone you thought had made a standing offer to be your parent.) \n\nBut yeah, let's celebrate a minor child having her self-worth and sense of security totally crushed.", "Yeah, this is a really good perspective. It would be weird for OP to adopt Alex at this point when he's split up from her parent, and I don't even know if/how it would work logistically. \n\nBut I reallllly don't get all the Alex hate and complete lack of sympathy a lot of people are showing here. This kid lost a parent and then had a new parent-figure enter her life. That would be pretty traumatic for a lot of kids and I get why she might have felt weird about the adoption, then felt weird about \\*not\\* being adopted. Then, this parent-figure who has been in her life for quite a while and who has said there is a standing offer to fully become her parent, e.g. someone who is always going to have a connection to her and is particularly going to have a responsibility toward her while she's a minor, decides to *completely abandon her* and to make matters worse *it's her fault.* Does anyone understand how much that must have wrecked her, or are we too caught up in calling her \"manipulative\" and \"abusive\" and saying she destroyed the family when she was at most a young teen? \n\nLike, call me a bleeding heart liberal but I don't think a minor child can do anything bad enough to justify total, permanent parental abandonment. I get that OP was a stepparent and stepparents don't always stay in kids' lives after a divorce, but it sounds like OP had been around for quite a while and the sibling adoption/standing offer of adoption definitely makes the bonds even closer. Hold her accountable in a normal parental/disciplinary way by all means, and do what you need to to protect the other kids, but don't wash your hands of her and absolutely shatter her self-esteem and sense of security just because she's difficult.", "This is the perfect response", "This is incredibly cruel advice. Why are we assuming this girl is evil and deserves to be toyed with rather than that she is acting out because she is damaged/traumatized by having a parent die? Now another parent has left her because of her actions as a young teen. Basically the stereotypical \"kids think the divorce was their fault\" thing is actually true for her, which has to absolutely wreck her self esteem! I get that it would be weird, and perhaps not even possible, for OP to adopt her now that she has divorced her dad, but stringing her along is only going to hurt her more and is an extremely strange, if not malicious, suggestion.", "Yeah, I don't get how it makes sense for OP to adopt Alex *now,* but I can't believe she is getting off so easy for the devastation she might have caused to this kid's psyche. Don't offer to be someone's permanent parent if you don't mean it! It's not normal for a consequence of young teen behavior to be that one of your parents leaves... and it's your fault. \n\nShe's already lost one mother and has obviously been pretty damaged by it, which is the clear source of her bad behavior. Then another mother shows up, wanting to take her mom's place. That's obviously confusing and upsetting, especially when the siblings have a mom and she feels left out and wonders if she made the wrong choice. But then that mom *also leaves* and if she has any idea of why that must crush her self-esteem and make her feel really insecure that anyone who is supposed to love her unconditionally will be there for her.", "I completely agree here. Sure, it could be partially motivated by money and materialistic things, but it could be Alex realizing OP was a good mom to her. \n\nAt 16, though, I would expect Alex to be able to provide some reasons for her behavior. I wouldn't consider this without a few family therapy sessions, including your ex.", "Yeah, thank you, all the hatred for Alex is baffling. She was obviously acting out because she already lost a parent and was having trouble accepting a replacement. \n\nAnd then the replacement, who had supposedly offered a parent's unconditional love, turned out not to mean it and blamed her for the fact that she left! So this girl has now lost two mothers and one of them was supposedly her fault, over behavior she committed as a young teen. That's so incredibly messed up! Actions have consequences, but when you're a kid the consequences should never be permanent abandonment by a parent (or someone who gave a standing offer to be a parent.)", "This is wrong, OP is responsible to protect her children from being bullied even and especially if the abuse is coming from another child in her custody. \n\nGiven her ex was undermining her prior efforts, in effect it was her duty to separate them the only way she could, which was by divorcing and getting custody. OP will be complicit in her children's further abuse if she lets Alex move in with them.", "It\u2019s not 100% fair to say this is a trauma as a result of op. It\u2019s possible Alex was happy with it just being her and the ex since she felt Carter betrayed her by being adopted and she avoided her half siblings. And according to op, Alex has made no strides towards showing she wants to be a part of op\u2019s family again through action. Just commented on material things then asked to be adopted. She\u2019s only commented on how big op\u2019s house is and how much more stuff her siblings have. Her own brother says she\u2019s acting weird. Which tells me Alex has kept being mean to her siblings and only stopped when she saw where they were living. I\u2019m not even sure op can adopt her. Her behavior towards the other siblings would come into play. They\u2019d ask why she\u2019d want to be adopted since she chose to live with her dad. There\u2019s no signs of abuse that says she should leave her dad. It\u2019s uncommon for a child to want to be adopted by the parent they hated and resulted in the parents divorce.", "Exactly! She was the catalyst in breaking up the marriage, I hope OP sees that.", "This exactly.  Do not put your children in harm\u2019s way.  She will go back to her old ways soon enough", "OT thank you TIL a new word, duplicitous.", "Except that she adopted the other sibling, who is now living apart from this sister. Who is actually caring for this kid?", "Right. Not to mention getting an idea of if this about face is legit or not. Because if it is because she wants the same things her siblings have there's no guarantee she won't enter a cycle of acting out & the behaving because once OP's her mom its not like OP can leave you know?", "It might not even be possible to adopt a minor while you\u2019re not married to the bio parent in your state", "But they only remained equal as long as they chose adoption?   \n\n\nEdit: Not to be too harsh, but was it necessary in order for \\*them\\* to feel like they were equal, or for \\*you\\* to feel like they were equal? Because it seems like at some point, you stopped seeing them that way.", "Thought I went a bit over board, my comments as long as her entire post lol. I just really wanted to make sure all bases were covered if she read it, so she knew the potential consequences beforehand. \n\nI\u2019m honestly shocked they even had the audacity to ask her after everything. I\u2019m honestly questioning if this is a money grab not just on the step daughters part but the dads too. Think about it - his wife leaves with the two kids because his daughters uncontrollable. Now he has to learn how to handle her himself and he has to do it without the money he grew accustomed to while married. I also think he knows if she\u2019s adopted OP wouldn\u2019t want her to live there full time. He has to be aware he would be eligible for child support from her.", "Then the whole idea isn\u2019t even realistic.

I was going to say set up a schedule for her to start staying over bit by bit and if once she\u2019s 18 you\u2019ve seen she\u2019s changed and want to - adopt her. That way if she changes after the adoption you have zero legal financial responsibility to her. But if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with her staying over then there\u2019s no real way to even test out her motives up close (because her/her dads word, time, and small pleasantries with you and the kids isn\u2019t enough to trust an adoption with her history).", "If you\u2019re not comfortable with having her there for an extended period, then you shouldn\u2019t be adopting her.

Kinda feels just like a financial chain. Or like Dad is going to skip town and wants the last one out now. \n\nIt sounds like you were a mother to all three children for quite awhile.

Now the problem child seems to want back into the family with her siblings and the person who was her mother for many years. \n\nIt's really important to remember she is a kid and you are an adult. Kids mature and big life changes stress them and impact them far more than adults. A kid that's gone through a divorce, household split, lost 2 siblings and a parent, and is left alone with an unsupportive parent that likely doesn't show the care you do is absolutely enough to really shock the system and cause some big changes in how you view the world and relationships. \n\nIt's also quite relevant that she is a teen girl living with a single father alone who doesn't seem to understand her issues or emotions even ignoring many of the significant differences that teen girls face these days. It's quite a lot. \n\nAnd she is still your two other children's sibling and will be for life. They have feelings too and probably have emotions about their sister that they haven't fully processed.

So it's really less that you would do it if she said yes and more the offer is on the table if she wanted that level of security from you as a parental figure. \n\nI think I'd sit her down and explain that you don't understand why she wants to be adopted. Don't put any intent on her even though you have some. Just say it doesn't make sense to you. It seems like she only ever viewed you as her dad's partner l, and now you're not even that.

If you can see that, you are either have never had children, or you are white trash.", "Thank you kind sir, and fellow person who is evidently too old for reddit based on your username. I feel like I really want the OP to see this, but that my thought is just drowned out in a sea of people dumping on a 16 year old girl with grief and trauma issues. It makes me sad how the overwhelming majority are all just assuming evil intentions from a child, instead of acknowledging she suffered a huge loss she couldn't possibly cope with at a very young age.\n\nThat almost certainly caused a weird sort of resentment in her, because it sounds like the mom died either in childbirth or very shortly after the birth of the brother, so she, as a small child, probably had a misguided feeling that blamed him for the loss... And then that gets ratcheted up a notch by him having no attachment to the mother he never knew and jumping on the option of adoption, while she DID have a mother she lost, and would likely feel like it was a huge violation to accept another mother after her's died. And then an additional child, half sibling to this new mother got added, and so she became the only child in the house now that didn't have a mom...\n\nThe husband just \\_SUCKS\\_ for not letting them seek therapy. I cannot even imagine what that poor girl has gone through. I lost my single mother at 19, and I am still affected by that stuff even though it was in 2001. This poor girl is only 16. It just feels so wrong to me to ignore the cause behind her actions, and jump to the conclusion that she has evil, selfish, and maligned intentions now that she's older and behaving differently. It's not like I think it's IMPOSSIBLE she has bad intentions here, I just don't think it's cut and dry, fully obvious, immediately true that she's evil. She's SIXTEEN. I mean, my god.\n\nSo I totally get that the situation is super weird with them being divorced, but I think this poor girl at least deserves a chance to prove her intentions before being rejected out of hand, because if she is, in fact, genuine and innocent in this, that rejection could just destroy her as a person. As far as I'm concerned, she suffered more than enough, and deserves compassion...\n\nBut I feel like my voice is just so small compared to that tidal wave of vitriol against her, it makes me genuinely upset on her behalf. I hope this OP gives her a chance. It'd make my whole year to have this come back up in a bestofredditorupdates or something in a year and hear that the girl was genuine, they worked things out and got some therapy, she's adopted officially, and they all live happily every after as a real, lovely family together (all does not include the asshole father that doesn't listen, belittled real issues, and then refused counselling, because eff that guy imo).", "These kinds of absolutist claims are just plain ridiculous. Life isn't black and white. Yes, generally breaking promises to a kid is bad but it absolutely is better for a kid's growth and mental health to be reassured about being loved when their brother is being adopted and they're not - even if they're never adopted due to a change in situations. \n\nClaiming that some sort of response is ALWAYS the best one when you're not even a part of the situation and don't have a handle on the interpersonal relationships involved is just silly.", "Consequences need to be taught too. For this lady to adopt her, the child needs therapy and to take responsibility for her actions. At 16 she\u2019s also capable of seeing that his dad and OP split up, which entails a massive change in the status quo. The division into two homes clearly solidified that. If she needs help to understand that and REALLY wants OP as a mother, then she needs to ask for help and it needs to be given the right away. THAT is the compassionate way. Not just keeping promises just for the sake of keeping them, when other children\u2019s safety (let\u2019s not forget the super intense bullying) can be at stake.\n\nInsulting is absolutely unnecessary and I recommend you seek therapy as well.", "You say it was wrong to adopt one child and not the other. Alex rejected the idea immediately. After a couple of years it was Carter who asked to be adopted - that it meant a lot to him. So what were they supposed to do? Hurt Carter because of Alex's wishes? Or force Alex into an adoption she didn't want but Carter did?", "She can be apart of her life without adopting her. She can also still choose to keep her away if Alex ends up being abusive again. It\u2019s hard to trust when your children have been hurt for an extended number of years. And if her father isn\u2019t putting her in therapy, adoption or not she may not have the ability to put Alex in therapy herself now that they are divorced and she has no custody.", "Yes, but she did not want to be adopted and the situation has changed from when that promise was made. At that point they were MARRIED and together as a family. At that time, dad didn't even listen to his wife about any issues going on with Alex and the fact that maybe Alex needed therapy. What changes now? Especially since OP has no legal right or obligation to the child. Now they are divorced. Now all of a sudden she's supposed to let Alex change her mind to get adopted when OP and Alex don't even live in the same house and OP is DIVORCED from Dad? Because Alex thinks that she can have a nicer life and material things?", "I lost my mother to cancer at 3, just months after she gave birth to my brother and sister. We grew up motherless, and it was very hard. In many ways it was harder on me because I was the oldest. I was the only one who remembered Mom. I was the one who had to grow up way too quickly to help take care of my siblings. I just feel so sad for this girl.", "If you believe demeaning a child and dehumanizing what they have gone through is ok, than yeah insulting is warranted. I don\u2019t need therapy for this. Maybe you should look into your own soul and see what life is about. I already receive therapy. But that is for another time and story. (PTSD from War) I will never condone abandonment of a child.", "Or because Alex feels bad about breaking her family up and now wants to live in the same house as and spend time with the brother she grew up with and their little sister. She was 10 or 11 when she refused the adoption, and it seems like the fighting started pretty quickly after that. She's 16 now. Perhaps, now that she's becoming an adult AND has actually learned what it is to lose her family, she's trying to show genuine remorse and do what she can to make things better.   \n\n\nI see mentions of OP's feelings, Carter's feelings, husband's feelings, Emily's feelings... with Alex, other than the mention of her not being into the adoption when she was 10, all I see is comments about her \\*behavior\\*. It seems like the only kids whose feelings are legitimate to OP or anyone here are those who behave the right way all the time.", "She also has no legal connection to Alex given she's divorced from Alex's father and she did not legally adopt Alex at Alex's request. Alex's father didn't want to hear anything about what was going on and didn't think his daughter needed therapy and wouldn't consider it. I worked in child welfare for years and the behavior described by Alex towards her siblings would be considered neglect in regards to the parent for not intervening and possibly even medical neglect for not pursuing counseling. I'm not sure that she can even be adopted now given OP is not married to Dad. The promise was made while they was still a family living as a family under the same roof. That is no longer the case.", "Not adopting does not mean abandoning.\n\nYou might need reading comprehension classes.", "Actually it was DAD refusing to get any help or intervene with Alex that broke up the family.", "And having worked with a teenage population for many years, teenagers in their mid teens can be very manipulative, narcissistic, materialistic and self-centered.", "Actually it was DAD who refused intervene or considered therapy for his daughter that broke up the marriage.", "That's fair.... I misspoke slightly. What I meant to say was that certain types of empathy start developing at an accelerated rate beginning at 13 and that continues until at least 21, based on the research discussed in this 2013 WSJ article:\n\n[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304561004579137514122387446](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304561004579137514122387446)\n\nNow, this article focuses on the part of the study that showed how empathy fluctuates in \\*boys\\*, but the study still showed that empathy rises steadily through adolescence in both boys and girls. It says that it stays relatively high in girls throughout teen years, but that is relative to their male peers... it's saying that it doesn't tend to fluctuate as much in girls, but that it still steadily increases into adulthood and is not fully developed as a teen.\n\nWhat I was also thinking of, and just found a source for, was the study discussed in this New Scientist article from 2009 on Theory of Mind, which is the ability of the brain to understand another person's thoughts and feelings:\n\n[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16535-why-teenagers-cant-see-your-point-of-view/](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16535-why-teenagers-cant-see-your-point-of-view/)\n\nI first saw it several years ago when I was dating a woman with teenage daughters, so it kind of stayed in my head. It indicated that teens are much worse than adults when it comes to this key facet of human empathy. This one was an all-girl study, so I don't think a gender bias would apply when considering these results in relation to Alex's case, either. From the article:\n\n\\--The study\u2019s findings may also explain teens\u2019 sometimes callous actions.\n\n\u201cWhat is really new and amazing about this paper, is that they show that adolescents show strong egocentric behaviour that is very similar to that of young children,\u201d says Boaz Keysar, a cognitive psychologist at the University of Chicago.--\n\nAsk anyone you know who has grown kids when the \"mean phase\" started and ended. I can bet that the overwhelming majority will tell you it was about 12-16.\n\nNow, consider the story presented again. Alex is now 16 and Emily is 6. Alex was presented with the choice of adoption shortly after Emily was born... so she was maybe 10 or 11 at the time. The story says that this is when the bad behavior started-- obviously a reaction by a traumatized pre-teen who lost her mother around 2 or 3 years old (based on OP's comments) and is now dealing with two more major changes to her family that she has no control over. While is growing in ways that she has no control over as well. I can imagine that the behavior lead to discipline and fights between child and stepmom, so it's understandable that this child did not choose adoption over the ensuing years, especially if she could already feel OP behaving like only the other two are \"her\" kids after Carter's adoption.\n\nBased on the order of the OP's statements, it seemed like the \"ignoring her sister\" thing was around this time, when Emily was still a baby and Alex was 10-12. It \"got worse\" after that, but we don't really have any specifics to back that up. It could just be that Emily started growing up and doing annoying toddler things as Alex was hitting puberty, and the ignoring became fighting \\*between siblings\\*. It is INCREDIBLY common for kids to have issues accepting a new sibling and a new stepmother. And a dead mother. It would kind of be crazy to assume that at least one of the two kids would not have some major issues processing even one of these events, let alone all three.\n\nAs far as allegations of abuse... it's not as if the \"bullying\" was going on constantly, or that they had no positive relationship as siblings, or that the relationships are not threatened by her mom taking her little brother and sister away from her. I can't see how anyone could think splitting them up instead of helping them work through this trouble is good for any these kids, or that Carter especially won't end up resenting his mom for it. She specifically said it stopped when the father was around, and that the dad still picks up the two kids for visits and they see each other at those times, and that Alex is behaving better. I think it's unreasonable to assume that this is due to ulterior motives rather than a young girl who didn't really like her siblings or stepmom growing up, but is now learning how to be an adult and appreciate them more.\n\nFurther, like... I don't want to say anyone is too sensitive, and maybe I was just a jaded kid or something... but my siblings and I ignored each other all the time. We unplugged each others' games and called each other stupid. It didn't hurt me badly or ruin our relationship, because we also apologized when our parents weren't around, supported each other in the real world, played together, and loved each other \\*even when we were mean.\\* Again, all of this behavior she described-- and I just read her post again twice-- is what I would describe as normal fighting between siblings, not abuse from an uncaring older sister. I would not even call this bullying. Older siblings are often mean to younger siblings. \n\nI grew up low-income, so I dunno... maybe it's a class thing. Maybe kids in OP's income bracket just don't do that kind of fighting and she isn't used to it, and maybe they had some financial issues before OP came on the scene and the oldest kid developed stronger tendencies towards these behaviors than the younger one did before the lifestyle improved and poverty-based stressors went away. In any case, I guarantee you that worse things than what is described here are happening between siblings in millions of stable, loving households across the world tonight.", "YWBTA (You Would Be The Asshole)\n\nI understand that the situation has changed.

Yes they can't understand the whole complexity of their decisions and truly consent to a lot of stuff, but they definetely can understand that bullying a toddler (Emily was like 3 when all of this started) is a very bad thing. Or trashing someone's stuff is not right either. \n\nYes their hormones are raging, yes they defy all authority, but the line has to be drawn. It's like saying when a teen beats up another child that it's just hormones, he/she will outgrow it. She could decided to act out without harming others. \n\nNow, she sees what she lost and could have and suddenly wanted to be adopted. She is 16. In two years she will be an adult. Don't adopt her. Even your son, who spends more time with her is sceptical about her behaviour. Adoption offer annulled the moment the divorce papers were finalized. \n\nYou still can have relationship with her. And if she decides to bully two youngest after you refused it tells everything about her reasons behind her good behaviour. \n\nAlso, if she truly was guilty about her behaviour, did she apologize for what she did to you, her siblings and your marriage? Did she try to reconcile with you? To mend what was broken? Or she just saw your house and money and stuff you buy for other two and decided to ride the train on your dime without doing the hard work? Think very long about your decision. Consult a lawyer. \n\nAnd also your ex is suspicious. I sense some kind of a plan for child alimony. \n\nYou're NTA. Don't adopt her. Don't add to your load. You have 2 kids to raise. They need you way more.", "NTA. Please set boundaries for when she comes to your home", "NTA. My best friend was abused and bullied by his older sister for years and he is still recovering from the trauma. \n\nKnowing that she\u2019d be happy to switch guardians when she has professed such disdain for you and her siblings is so concerning. She\u2019s definitely got some anti-social, or even psychopathic, personality problems going on. \n\nShe\u2019s not your child, she\u2019s not your responsibility, and I don\u2019t think she should be allowed to be around your kids. What\u2019s she gonna do to them when she doesn\u2019t get what she wants?\n\nMost children don\u2019t get to choose their parents, they don\u2019t get the chance to leave their abusers behind until adulthood, your kids are lucky that she chose not to be a part of your family.", "He\u2019s your ex now so I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any law that\u2019ll allow you to adopt her any longer anyway.", "NTA and I bet your ex is hoping you take her upcoming college bills off his hands too.", "NTA it\u2019s a trap \ud83e\udea4", "NTA. Adoption within a blended family can be absolutely the right thing. But you and Alex's dad are no longer together, it seems wrong. I suspect your feelings about Alex's motivation are spot on. Say no, and if she starts on your other kids again, tell your ex that when he comes over she isn't to accompany him. Simple.", "NTA", "NTA. Adopting her was a possibility when you were married to her dad. I think it should be off the table now. I agree that it could potentially be because she sees that you have more money than dad. \n\nTwo other thoughts I had: \n\n1) Could she just be lonely because you have her two siblings and there's time when she's home alone without dad? Maybe you could invite her over sometimes?\n\n2) Is she looking for a mother figure in her life now that she's older? Again, you could invite her over sometimes. \n\nI don't think there's any scenario where you're obligated to adopt her.", "Nta. She was the cause of this break up, your ex didn't want therapy, she's 16 now and you have no legal  obligation. If you really do consider and still want to adopt her I would only do so after therapy sessions.", "NTA. Listen to your instincts and don't let her manipulate you or her siblings. Who's to say that once you adopt her, she doesn't go back to being mean? \n\nYou dont need her negatively influencing the others. And you shouldn't reward her fake attitude because she's greedy.", "Well, this is a pretty complicated situation. Also, I'd watch out for legal issues. If you adopt it might put you on the hook for child support instead of her biological dad. I'm not sure how it works tbh but, the child support system in this country is kinda fucky.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLegal issues aside. I'd say NTA if you don't decide to adopt. But it might be worth talking to her about why she wants you to adopt her. Kids develop fast and she's older now than she was when she was obviously going through some shit. She might feel bad or guilty about you and your ex breaking up. She might be looking for some level of reconciliation. There's a chance she ended up feeling pretty isolated and didn't know how to process her feelings when you adopted Carter. Like, she might not have been able to say yes for some reason, then after the adoption she's the only kid in the picture who's not legally your child. But at her stage of development she might not have been able to process where the feelings of resentment, isolation, fear, etc. were coming from. That's all conjecture on my part, obviously. But yeah there might be a way to reconcile without adopting her, if you definitely don't want to do that. Either way, it might be a good idea to explore some family therapy to see if there is a way to find healing for everyone.", "How was she when all this went down?", "OP, if you are afraid of her retaliation towards her siblings, you can tell her that it's because you are no longer in s relationship with her dad, and you offered to adopt her when you were all a family. Then hopefully she will not see it as a rejection of HER.\n\nWhy does your ex even want you to adopt her when you are not together anymore? Is it for financial reasons or because he's tired of her behaviour and looking to unload her on you?", "\u2026 not too mention it sounds like the kid was a primary driving factor of the divorce in the first place", "Also, is she only thinking of college fees. I\u2019d want to know why the change of heart, and suggest one on one time prior to any talk of adoption. I don\u2019t think anyone is the a, except maybe your ex for pushing.", "Honestly, I would suspect that the ex planted these seeds and encouraged this behavior rather than a 16 year old having this sort of logical reasoning and forethought. I remember being 17/18 and looking at colleges and money not really being a real factor to me. I knew I was supposed to be applying to scholarships and the like but I was truly incapable of fully grasping the type of money it took to attend college.", "I completely agree", "Exactly", "Someone else pointed out that the divorce was caused by the dad refusing to believe both his partner (OP) and their younger kids about the preteen/ teenager acting out.\nHe refused to punish Alex and didn't feel therapy was needed.\n\nI think assigning blame to the correct party is a very valid point, it also shows OP's maturity and repeated attempts to make the marriage work. \n\nIn conclusion: imo OP should fine tune your proposed message a little, and then don't hold your breath over the ex stepping up.", "Sheesh, but how could the daughter then demand op's money? There's an awful lot of stuff op needs to buy and spend money on. College, car, new clothes, bigger house etc.\n\nBig picture, folks, come on! \ud83e\udd23\n\nOp, if this was motivated by anything but financial, I would say consider it. But she could be nicer to all without op spending money. I say protect the other two and make sure she doesn't hurt either of them. The good behaviour may be only temporary or contingent on things brought for her.", "She showed you who she is a long time ago - believe her.    \nYou ended your relationship with your husband because of her.  Don't let her back in now that your children finally have some peace.  If she does start tormenting your kids again then go for a restraining order and only allow supervised visitations with your ex.", "Why is her dad encouraging you to adopt her when you are not together anymore?", "You could tell her you'll potentially adopt her for symbolic reasons after she's 18 and has 2 years+ proven track record of showing she's changed. If she shows any red flags you can be out immediately and not financially on the hook at any time. If she truly had changed it might help heal things with the siblings. But you don't let her move in nor give her money nor spend money on her outside of meals. \nI doubt she can keep up the act for 2 years. \nI'd make it clear she will never get yo live with you nor will you be spending money on her. So in essence your offering potential time and access to her siblings for a familiar and not financial relationship. \nIf she's in it for the money you'll no doubt get a negative reaction. If she doesn't leap to any chance to spent with siblings and needs time to think about it or debrief with her dad, then you know it's not on the level.\n\nNTA she's burned the official daughter status chance.", ">\"I don't think a minor child can do anything bad enough to justify total, permanent parental abandonment.\"\n\nEhhh minors can be murderers and psychopaths. They can be mentally unstable and a danger to themselves and others. \n\nIm not saying Alex was at that level and I think it's a damn shame her father agreed to divorce before agreeing to therapy. But there are absolutely situations where it's ok to walk away - even from your child.", "This is really your answer. Your marriage split up over her behaviour for a reason, you certainly shouldn\u2019t adopt her now when she cannot be trusted to be left with the rest of the family. A few years of showing her behaviour has changed and maybe then you think about it, it comes at the end of that process, not the start.", "The behavioural problems started after her brother's adoption. There's more to this and the would know what the issues is if the father had trusted his wife and got her into therapy. Her father is to blame for the divorce, not her. Blaming children's behaviour for the parents divorce when one of the parents refused to get their child any help is ridiculous", "And add family therapy", "Thank you. This behaviour wasn't always there so OP's ex should have trusted his wife and gotten his daughter into therapy to figure out where all this stemmed from. There are a lot of possible scenarios. Maybe she felt alone being the only.child that wasn't OP's (through no fault of op) but didn't want to get adopted in fear of 'rejecting' her bio mom or something (with no info on bio she could be dead or just gone but she still has hope she will come back). \n\nAt the end of the day regardless of the source of all this OP's husband is to blame for not listening/trusting OP.", "Good point!", "That is not what open adoption means.", "She made it very clear that she was never interested in being family. She\u2019s literally the one that broke up the family. She could\u2019ve stopped the divorce even. And she\u2019s no toddler anymore, her mental capacity is definitely developed enough for this.", "Her father's response to her behaviour was why, surely?\n\nIn OP's stead, I'd need a serious apology with assorted commitment to improve from BOTH of them before I'd even consider letting them back into the house. \nThey can do the handover of the younger kids some other way: my own parents just rang the doorbell of the respective houses and waited in the car till we came out. \n\nIsn't it telling that OP got full custody over Carter, rather than Carter's biological parent?\nOr am I reading too much into that, and does the court treat adoptive parents fully equally? I have no experience here.", "I wish I could give you an award.", "Agreed.\nI think it's telling that OP got full custody for Carter, as an adoptive parent, instead of Carter's biological parent. Especially since it sounds like Carter is old enough to have a say...", "You're not wrong about the dad being responsible but the post says their divorce was finalized last year, which would put her at 15, and means she hasn't had 6 years to mature. She's had one. That changes things.", "Agreed.\nAlso, where did the \"dad was probably a drunk ass\"' come from? OP hasn't said anything about problems with her ex, except the issue of not believing OP or the younger kids about Alex' bullying.", "Ahhh the kid broke the family up. Do you really believe that? They broke up bc they had underlying issues. Not bc of a child. Welcome to life. Kids don\u2019t break marriages. The asshole parents do, especially those whom blame the children. Mine have been married for 50 years. If they divorced (which they probably should have) neither would have ever blamed the kids.", "I appreciate the sentiment with or without the award. Thank you.", "Actually, I place most of the responsibility on the father rather than Alex. He failed to handle this when it was time.\n\nI can understand that perhaps Alex was mad, maybe feeling she was the only one wanting to avoid breaking the link with her mother (whatever it really was in her mind, you get the gist I hope) and this behavior was an unhealthy way to exteriorise that pain/sadness.\n\nWith that being said, it's not like Alex is homeless and has no one in her life. She has someone who cares for her, but as far as I'm concerned, she burned a lot of bridges and is nonetheless too much of a risk for everyone else's emotional wellbeing (OP and the other two children).", "I place most of the responsibility on the father rather than Alex.

Period.", "Exactly. So many of these commenters just completely lack empathy or any amount of emotional maturity to understand the complexity of this situation. Her behavior sounds completely normal for the situation she was in. She likely didn\u2019t know how damaging her behavior was until it was too late. But none of that is her fault. It\u2019s her fathers!! He\u2019s obviously a moron.", "Same can be said for you. You don\u2019t know the issues. Get over it. The girl is still a child. Children do need discipline, but they should not be rejected bc they do not understand the situation. Put yourself in this kid\u2019s shoes. Pathetic", "OP's marriage ended because of this girl. Cutting her loose (especially when her own bio brother doesn't believe her) is the best choice.", "Well someone needs a hug", "I don\u2019t understand you, the young lady rejected for years OP . The offer to adopt her was obviously in the sense of a family and the only reason the teenager now is interested is after seeing the financial gains she could have if she\u2019s adopted , it has zero to do with emotional bond. Why would you adopt someone that looks at you as a wallet and only changed their attitude towards you when they realised they can get stuff from you ?", "She was 10 when she first rejected the adoption. Then they waited, till Carter brought it up again a few years later.\nAlex rejected it again and started a few years of bullying. \nCue several conflicts between OP and the dad about Alex' behaviour and eventually about being believed.\n\nIt doesn't feel to me like they based this decision on a single conversation when Alex was 10.", "100% he\u2019s probably just hoping she in fact stupid enough to fall for it I hope she holds firm", "That\u2019s what children do. They reject people whom they think are the cause of their PARENTS issues. You people are pathetic", "So you believe someone showing interest to you only for financial gain is perfectly acceptable. Gotcha"]}
