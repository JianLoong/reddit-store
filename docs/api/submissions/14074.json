{"id": 14074, "submission_id": "12ctafd", "title": "WIBTA for not adopting my ex's older daughter when I said I would?", "selftext": "After my ex and I had our daughter, Emily, we decided to talk to the other kids about me legally adopting my ex's two older kids (Alex and Carter). Carter was really into the idea, but Alex was not. So we put it off. A couple years later Carter brought it up and he really wanted me to adopt him. So we decided that I would adopt Carter and told Alex that if she ever changed her mind I would adopt her too.\n\nAfter Carter\u2019s adoption was finalized things went downhill. Alex started acting out and would yell and get argumentative. She would hide, throw out, and destroy my things and blamed it on me being careless or on our younger children. The worst part was her being mean to Carter and Emily. I caught her often calling Carter stupid and otherwise putting him down. She would unplug his games and his saves kept getting deleted. She would completely ignore Emily to the point that she would walk through whatever she was playing with and say she didn't see her there. She would only act this way when my ex wasn\u2019t around and he didn't believe me. He refused to consider getting her into therapy or doing family therapy.\n\nIt got progressively worse over the years. Realizing that nothing was going to change and my kids were going to continue to live with their sister bullying them I decided to end things. That was last year and we have just know gotten our divorce finalized. I have primary custody of Carter (who is now 13) and Emily (who is now 6).\u00a0\n\nAlex (who is now 16) was at my place for the first time a few weeks ago. She came with her dad when he was picking up Carter and Emily for the day.\u00a0Since then she has come over every time my ex has. The last time she was over she said she wanted me to adopt her now.  After everything that happened I didn't think that was a good idea, so I said no. My ex interjected and talked about how back when I adopted Carter I had promised to adopt Alex if she changed her mind.\n\nI didn't want to get into it with Carter and Emily right there so I told them we could talk about this some other time and had them leave.  Truthfully I feel like her motivation to have me adopt her is just based on me having more money than her dad. I don't think she realized this earlier because she was never at my house before. Since the first time she was over she made several comments on how big my house is and how her dad can't afford this or that. I do know that my ex has been having a lot of money problems recently too. \n\nThe part that makes me feel conflicted is that I have learned that Alex has been nicer to Carter and Emily since she has been over. So  If I say no to her I'm worried about her being mean to them again. Carter is suspicious about how she's acting and says she's being weird, but I know Emily would be really sad if Alex started ignoring her again. Still I don't want to be legally responsible for a kid that I'm pretty is only pretending to like me and being nice because she wants things from me.", "created_utc": 1680719082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ctafd/wibta_for_not_adopting_my_exs_older_daughter_when/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You adopted Carter when you were with your ex - as a family.\n\nYou split up, and are not a family any longer.\n\nYou are under no obligation to adopt a child who is no longer part of your family. Why would you take on legal responsibility for someone else's kid **when you are no longer in a relationship with their parent?**\n\nI would say no. The offer of adoption ended when your relationship did. And Alex chose which potential parent she wanted to live with. She is 16, and old enough to learn that decisions have consequences. I'm sure that if you were all still a family, adoption would still be on the table. But you aren't, and it's not.", "NTA\n\nShe's mistreated you and the younger kids for a long time. You were still married to her Dad when you made that promise, you aren't anymore. There's no point in being nice to someone who has proven they don't give a shit about you. Once you have adopted her you can't go back and she probably knows that. I'm pretty sure her good behaviour would change really fast and the only thing that would happen is she'd demand money all the time. She's 16, she can learn a lesson about actions and consequences.\n\nPlease protect your younger kids from her. I grew up with an abusive older sister who treated me very much like Alex treated Emily and it f\\*cks you up in so many ways.", ">After Carter\u2019s adoption was finalized things went downhill.\n\nCorrelation or causation? It sounds like there's a lot more to unpack here than Carter's adoption and having another child and that Alex needs to be in therapy (and needed to be in therapy ages ago).  \n\n\n>My ex interjected and talked about how back when I adopted Carter I had promised to adopt Alex if she changed her mind.\n\nThat promise was made before you had to literally move out and get custody of the other two children to keep them safe from Alex.", "NTA. You\u2019re not married any more why would you adopt Alex?", "NTA. She can just as easily start treating them badly again after she gets what she wants. If you consider it at all, it should be after group counseling, probably without the ex.", "NTA. Y\u2019all are divorced now and she made y\u2019all\u2019s life hell. You offered to adopt her and get therapy and both were refused. Protect yourself and your kids. I would just say you don\u2019t feel comfortable considering everything that has happened", "NTA- anyone can be nice for a short time. She is 16yo, so that means she was a teen and going terrible things to her siblings.   Also she is your ex's kid, there is no reason for you to adopt her.   I hope her Dad got her therapy when she was acting out because she sure needs it.\n\nSorry ex's ship sailed when he did not do much to stop her bad behavior. His money issues are his to deal with.", "NTA. \n\nStep-child adoptions are a thing, but are former step-child adoptions even entertained in court?

I would absolutely not make myself legally responsible for someone I did not trust", "NTA.\n\nAdoption has to work for everyone involved, not just the adoptee.\n\nI feel bad for Alex - I'm sure there was a lot going on in her head and she didn't know how to deal with it in a healthy way - but you can't put your mental health and the well being of your other kids in jeopardy if you're not sure about this.\n\nIf you're still open to the idea in theory, there's nothing wrong with slowly testing the waters - talking about it, having her over more (without her father), etc. to see if it might work out. If you're not open to it at this point, that's perfectly fair - just don't lead her on in that case.", "NTA \n\nIf and i mean BIG if you decide to go through with this before starting down the legal path, therapy/counseling is a non negotiable must that has to happen. If Alex and your ex don't agree to this then no go.", "NTA. Don\u2019t do this. What kind of nerve does she and your ex have to think this would make sense at this point? You\u2019re not together anymore and you don\u2019t have a real relationship with Alex anymore. This makes no sense. I\u2019m sorry for Alex but she needs therapy not a weird adoption on paper only situation.", "NTA. She wants you to adopt her for the wrong reasons.

Finally, \u201dyour an adult now and I don\u2019t really support adult adoption\u201d.\n\nIn all honesty, the first one is really good because it forces Alex to really want or not want an adoption.  The next two are just great delay tactics.\n\nFrom your description, I also think she just wants your money and I wouldn\u2019t be ok with that either.", "She seems far too manipulative and there would be no motivation for her to act kindly to them once adoption was no longer an issue. Meaning the same results would likely to occur if you adopt her or not. \n\nCould you possibly just work it out where you take her a few days a week so she can be with her siblings but not officially adopt her? Tell her you are worried that based on prior behavior she will change back. That you will treat her just as you do the others but if her behavior goes back to where she is hurting her siblings she is no longer welcome to stay. This way she remains motivated to be kind to them and it could be a win for everyone.", "There's a pretty easy way to resolve this. Give her the opportunity to show she wants to be a part of your family before you will agree to adopt her. \n\nRefusing outright would make you an asshole. She's a kid who was going through a lot of changes. It's fairly common for the older sibling who remembers their other parent better to be more resistant to blending families. She deserves a chance to repair her relationships with her siblings. \n\nAllowing her to take advantage of you or harm your children would also make you the asshole. \n\nSo just let her come over and spend time with y'all and see where it leads.

If Carter is suspicious of Alex\u2019s motives, you should be too.", "INFO.  Why did you and your husband try to erase her mother?  Did you not get her counseling when this occurred.  It\u2019s really obvious to a non therapist like me that she felt you two were trying to erase her mother and when you convinced her brother to be adopted, she felt alone and isolated.  I would like to know what happened to her mother.", "I'm of two minds on this one.\n\nYou are divorced, so adopting her now does feel a little strange, and her actions are a little suspicious. But breaking promises, especially to kids, is asshole behavior.\n\nAlso, I don't think you're reading this situation fully. Her actions, picking on her brother after he got adopted, ignoring the shared child, these actions scream jealousy. There's a disconnect here. To me, this whole thing reads... Wrong. Did their mother die, or abandon them? Why was there a thing about you legally adopting them at all? The way this reads feels like really important stuff is left out. Like, maybe this girl lost her mother, and felt like letting you adopt her was some sort of massive betrayal, so she said no to it... But then her brother had a full mom in you, the shared sister had a full mom in you, and only SHE didn't. So she started acting out, unable to deal with, or even understand, how she was feeling... And now she's gotten a little older, and sees what they have, she's more capable of coping with the feelings and wants you to be her mom too, because she always loved you and felt left out and wants to fix it...\n\nIt's really hard to say anything here, because it just feels like there's something really important absent in this. I can wholly understand you being suspicious, and wanting to safely test the waters, but I think you need to genuinely understand her motives before you reject her.", "ESH - why did you and your ex let that behavior go for years? it sounds like she needed some kind of anger management or therapy", "ESH\n\nYou're talking about Alex like she is a grown adult who had all this malicious intent against you... She was 10-11 years old when this behavior started - and she's still only 16! \n\nIt sounds like Alex's biological parents have failed her in a number of ways, and it's unfortunate that instead of having a healthy relationship with you, this is just another trauma in her life.", "YTA.

The motivations behind your adoption offer have been erased entirely over the years.  This situation is very different.  And, based on the information you presented, I agree her motives are not impure.  You also shouldn't adopt a child because you feel emotionally blackmailed into it, either.", "NTA Whatevet her motive, it's NOT loving you as a parental figure and wanting to make it official.

Teen angst or not, she acted truly vile. And she's continuing to act truly vile by only mentioning the nice things you have, never that she misses and loves you. YWNBTA.", "INFO\n\nFrom your post I see a teenager going through a really hard time. Is there a pattern of behavior from Alex that shows she\u2019s only interested in your money?\n\nMaybe I\u2019m biased from my own experiences, but I could see Alex maybe feeling like she lacks security and a mother figure in her life. Since you seemed to have raised her through some difficult tween-teenage years, maybe she does view you as a safe person and wants to make amends.\n\nSometimes teenagers act out, especially if they\u2019ve had an unstable family life. Based on your post I think it\u2019s important to think about Alex\u2019s perspective and not jump to conclusions based on the shitty things she\u2019s done as a child that could be hurting inside.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously your right to make the decision to adopt and it\u2019s fair for you to say no. If there\u2019s a glimmer of hope that maybe what I said is true or resonates with you, you can always think about the decision and let Alex prove to you that she views you as family and not a financial asset.\n\n**TL;DR take time in your decision. There\u2019s not enough info about Alex\u2019s behavior to warrant an asshole/not the asshole judgement. I\u2019m giving Alex the benefit of the doubt that her intentions are good based on my own experience as a hurting teenager\u2026 she is basically still a child after all.**", "Fair point. There is no reason to adopt when they arent together anymore", "That's what I was wondering, an ex-step-mom adopting a child AFTER the step-mom and dad divorce?  How does that even work, she's the legal mom but has no custody?  I'm confused.", "Sure why not? In some places even adults can be adopted by other adults who never raised them / weren\u2019t involved with their parents.", "To be honest I'm not comfortable with her in the house for extended period because I wouldn't be able to always watch her.", "That's probably a good idea, but I think I'll try with somewhere outside our home.", "Refusing outright would not make her an AH, it would make her sane! This girl is manipulative, she basically tore the family apart, realized that Oops! step mom had the money, and isn't even acknowledging or apologizing for her shitty behavior and bullying! She now wants to be adopted cause her dad doesn't have a lot of money.  No way saying no makes her an AH. Also, she's 16, not 6 she knows exactly what she's doing.", "We didn't erase her.

And btw shame on your ex for not believing you.", "Makes sense. I was thinking it would motivate her to be good to them when they go to your exes. This is a tough one as the second the thought of adoption is off the table she will start again & maybe worse. Hopefully that\u2019s not at all the case. Best of luck and I wish peace for you and the kids.", "Definitely have it in a neutral place.  This girl is manipulative, so be very wary of her.", "Yep, that exactly fits my guess.\n\nAgain, I don't disagree with you being suspicious and cautious at all, there's a lot of history here. But I think you should spend some time with her, and try to figure out how she's really feeling and what's behind her changing her mind. It's easy to assume bad intentions, humans have a severe negativity bias as a species, but reality is much more nuanced than that.\n\nI've studied psych with an emphasis in developmental psychology, neuroscience, and psychology of emotion, but I am NOT a certified clinical or counselling psychologist, and so I'm not going to give anything that can even pose as counselling advice here, this is just educated advice from a random dad on the interwebz, but I really think you should spend some time with her, one on one, and talk through some of this stuff. Ask her about her past behaviors, honestly explain they are making you somewhat uneasy about this situation, and explain that if it's going to happen you are going to have to rebuild trust and a relationship first. Maybe even book some sessions of family counselling with a professional, so you have a third party to arbitrate things. It's really easy for fragile teens (and all teens in general, because they are all fragile at some level in that stage of development) to take things really wrong and break. An independent, neutral third party to bridge some misunderstandings for you both can help immensely.\n\nJust because this seems like a sudden about face to you doesn't mean it's not genuine... But just because she might genuinely have changed doesn't mean you should ignore and disregard the past actions and put yourself and your other children at risk. Do what feels right for you and them, safely... But I don't think you should just reject her out of hand over her past actions without fully understanding her first. You may be risking damaging her emotionally even more, and yourself missing out on a lifelong loving relationship with her in doing so.\n\nEdit: Adding a verdict after the extra info - IMO this is a NAH.", "You are holding her accountable for behavior that you didn't correct while you were parenting her. You bear some responsibility and culpability for the way her life has turned out. \n\nHer biological parents are also to blame - but you've failed her repeatedly.", "Can't remember the last time I've been so convinced about my judgement. I'll gladly put all my karma on the line for this one.\n\nShe made a promise to a child to be their parent. Kids don't just start bullying acting out without reason, Alex clearly was going through some stuff and it's not hard to figure out what, since it started right after Carter was adopted.\nIf OP adopts and gets some degree of custody she can get Alex the help she has needed for a long time, that her ex rejected.\n\nYou don't just get to just keep the \"easy\" kids and discard the \"hard\" one. It's heartless.", "She\u2019s only 2 years away from being an adult. I imagine the adoption process takes time anyways. Although I wouldn\u2019t suggest OP adopt her even if it is possible. She definitely sounds like she has ulterior motives for wanting this and she hasn\u2019t yet proven herself around her younger siblings.", "I tried to, but my ex didn't believe she was doing anything so when I tried for example taking away electronics he would just give them back to her.", "No, the kid ONLY wants the adoption now because OP has money and her Dad doesn't.", "\"Close enough\" doesn't usually work with legal requirements. You can't begin an adult adoption in any state (as far as I know) as a minor. So, not only is this a bad idea for many reasons, it may be practically impossible anyway.", "Then definitely NTA. Your ex enabled her awful behavior and it negatively impacted your other two kids. How she chooses to treat her siblings is on her alone now since she is not a little kid. If Carter is suspicious about it then he\u2019s probably spot on with what he\u2019s thinking. I\u2019ll advise you not to adopt her because you yourself do not want that responsibility. It\u2019s not gonna be good for you and if she mistreats her sibling again because of it then you will have made the right choice. Your youngest may be upset that Alex ignores her again but that will all be up to Alex and her father to fix that type of behavior."]}
