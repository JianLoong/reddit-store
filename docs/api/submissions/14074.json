{"id": 14074, "submission_id": "12ctafd", "title": "WIBTA for not adopting my ex's older daughter when I said I would?", "selftext": "After my ex and I had our daughter, Emily, we decided to talk to the other kids about me legally adopting my ex's two older kids (Alex and Carter). Carter was really into the idea, but Alex was not. So we put it off. A couple years later Carter brought it up and he really wanted me to adopt him. So we decided that I would adopt Carter and told Alex that if she ever changed her mind I would adopt her too.\n\nAfter Carter\u2019s adoption was finalized things went downhill. Alex started acting out and would yell and get argumentative. She would hide, throw out, and destroy my things and blamed it on me being careless or on our younger children. The worst part was her being mean to Carter and Emily. I caught her often calling Carter stupid and otherwise putting him down. She would unplug his games and his saves kept getting deleted. She would completely ignore Emily to the point that she would walk through whatever she was playing with and say she didn't see her there. She would only act this way when my ex wasn\u2019t around and he didn't believe me. He refused to consider getting her into therapy or doing family therapy.\n\nIt got progressively worse over the years. Realizing that nothing was going to change and my kids were going to continue to live with their sister bullying them I decided to end things. That was last year and we have just know gotten our divorce finalized. I have primary custody of Carter (who is now 13) and Emily (who is now 6).\u00a0\n\nAlex (who is now 16) was at my place for the first time a few weeks ago. She came with her dad when he was picking up Carter and Emily for the day.\u00a0Since then she has come over every time my ex has. The last time she was over she said she wanted me to adopt her now.  After everything that happened I didn't think that was a good idea, so I said no. My ex interjected and talked about how back when I adopted Carter I had promised to adopt Alex if she changed her mind.\n\nI didn't want to get into it with Carter and Emily right there so I told them we could talk about this some other time and had them leave.  Truthfully I feel like her motivation to have me adopt her is just based on me having more money than her dad. I don't think she realized this earlier because she was never at my house before. Since the first time she was over she made several comments on how big my house is and how her dad can't afford this or that. I do know that my ex has been having a lot of money problems recently too. \n\nThe part that makes me feel conflicted is that I have learned that Alex has been nicer to Carter and Emily since she has been over. So  If I say no to her I'm worried about her being mean to them again. Carter is suspicious about how she's acting and says she's being weird, but I know Emily would be really sad if Alex started ignoring her again. Still I don't want to be legally responsible for a kid that I'm pretty is only pretending to like me and being nice because she wants things from me.", "created_utc": 1680719082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ctafd/wibta_for_not_adopting_my_exs_older_daughter_when/", "score": 247, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You adopted Carter when you were with your ex - as a family.\n\nYou split up, and are not a family any longer.\n\nYou are under no obligation to adopt a child who is no longer part of your family. Why would you take on legal responsibility for someone else's kid **when you are no longer in a relationship with their parent?**\n\nI would say no. The offer of adoption ended when your relationship did. And Alex chose which potential parent she wanted to live with. She is 16, and old enough to learn that decisions have consequences. I'm sure that if you were all still a family, adoption would still be on the table. But you aren't, and it's not.", "NTA\n\nShe's mistreated you and the younger kids for a long time. You were still married to her Dad when you made that promise, you aren't anymore. There's no point in being nice to someone who has proven they don't give a shit about you. Once you have adopted her you can't go back and she probably knows that. I'm pretty sure her good behaviour would change really fast and the only thing that would happen is she'd demand money all the time. She's 16, she can learn a lesson about actions and consequences.\n\nPlease protect your younger kids from her.

I hope her Dad got her therapy when she was acting out because she sure needs it.\n\nSorry ex's ship sailed when he did not do much to stop her bad behavior. His money issues are his to deal with.", "NTA. \n\nStep-child adoptions are a thing, but are former step-child adoptions even entertained in court?

If you're not open to it at this point, that's perfectly fair - just don't lead her on in that case.", "NTA \n\nIf and i mean BIG if you decide to go through with this before starting down the legal path, therapy/counseling is a non negotiable must that has to happen.

Tell her you are worried that based on prior behavior she will change back. That you will treat her just as you do the others but if her behavior goes back to where she is hurting her siblings she is no longer welcome to stay. This way she remains motivated to be kind to them and it could be a win for everyone.", "There's a pretty easy way to resolve this. Give her the opportunity to show she wants to be a part of your family before you will agree to adopt her. \n\nRefusing outright would make you an asshole. She's a kid who was going through a lot of changes. It's fairly common for the older sibling who remembers their other parent better to be more resistant to blending families.

I would like to know what happened to her mother.", "I'm of two minds on this one.\n\nYou are divorced, so adopting her now does feel a little strange, and her actions are a little suspicious. But breaking promises, especially to kids, is asshole behavior.\n\nAlso, I don't think you're reading this situation fully. Her actions, picking on her brother after he got adopted, ignoring the shared child, these actions scream jealousy. There's a disconnect here. To me, this whole thing reads... Wrong. Did their mother die, or abandon them? Why was there a thing about you legally adopting them at all? The way this reads feels like really important stuff is left out. Like, maybe this girl lost her mother, and felt like letting you adopt her was some sort of massive betrayal, so she said no to it... But then her brother had a full mom in you, the shared sister had a full mom in you, and only SHE didn't. So she started acting out, unable to deal with, or even understand, how she was feeling... And now she's gotten a little older, and sees what they have, she's more capable of coping with the feelings and wants you to be her mom too, because she always loved you and felt left out and wants to fix it...\n\nIt's really hard to say anything here, because it just feels like there's something really important absent in this. I can wholly understand you being suspicious, and wanting to safely test the waters, but I think you need to genuinely understand her motives before you reject her.", "ESH - why did you and your ex let that behavior go for years? it sounds like she needed some kind of anger management or therapy", "ESH\n\nYou're talking about Alex like she is a grown adult who had all this malicious intent against you... She was 10-11 years old when this behavior started - and she's still only 16! \n\nIt sounds like Alex's biological parents have failed her in a number of ways, and it's unfortunate that instead of having a healthy relationship with you, this is just another trauma in her life.", "YTA.

Do you truly view her as family and want to take on a mom role in her life?\n\nMaybe I\u2019m biased from my own experiences, but I could see Alex maybe feeling like she lacks security and a mother figure in her life. Since you seemed to have raised her through some difficult tween-teenage years, maybe she does view you as a safe person and wants to make amends.\n\nSometimes teenagers act out, especially if they\u2019ve had an unstable family life. Based on your post I think it\u2019s important to think about Alex\u2019s perspective and not jump to conclusions based on the shitty things she\u2019s done as a child that could be hurting inside.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously your right to make the decision to adopt and it\u2019s fair for you to say no. If there\u2019s a glimmer of hope that maybe what I said is true or resonates with you, you can always think about the decision and let Alex prove to you that she views you as family and not a financial asset.\n\n**TL;DR take time in your decision. There\u2019s not enough info about Alex\u2019s behavior and your relationship to warrant an asshole/not the asshole judgement (since your decision seems to be stemming from her previous actions).

Best of luck and I wish peace for you and the kids.", "Definitely have it in a neutral place.  This girl is manipulative, so be very wary of her.", "Yep, that exactly fits my guess.\n\nAgain, I don't disagree with you being suspicious and cautious at all, there's a lot of history here. But I think you should spend some time with her, and try to figure out how she's really feeling and what's behind her changing her mind. It's easy to assume bad intentions, humans have a severe negativity bias as a species, but reality is much more nuanced than that.\n\nI've studied psych with an emphasis in developmental psychology, neuroscience, and psychology of emotion, but I am NOT a certified clinical or counselling psychologist, and so I'm not going to give anything that can even pose as counselling advice here, this is just educated advice from a random dad on the interwebz, but I really think you should spend some time with her, one on one, and talk through some of this stuff. Ask her about her past behaviors, honestly explain they are making you somewhat uneasy about this situation, and explain that if it's going to happen you are going to have to rebuild trust and a relationship first. Maybe even book some sessions of family counselling with a professional, so you have a third party to arbitrate things. It's really easy for fragile teens (and all teens in general, because they are all fragile at some level in that stage of development) to take things really wrong and break. An independent, neutral third party to bridge some misunderstandings for you both can help immensely.\n\nJust because this seems like a sudden about face to you doesn't mean it's not genuine... But just because she might genuinely have changed doesn't mean you should ignore and disregard the past actions and put yourself and your other children at risk. Do what feels right for you and them, safely... But I don't think you should just reject her out of hand over her past actions without fully understanding her first. You may be risking damaging her emotionally even more, and yourself missing out on a lifelong loving relationship with her in doing so.\n\nEdit: Adding a verdict after the extra info - IMO this is a NAH.", "You are holding her accountable for behavior that you didn't correct while you were parenting her. You bear some responsibility and culpability for the way her life has turned out. \n\nHer biological parents are also to blame - but you've failed her repeatedly.", "Can't remember the last time I've been so convinced about my judgement. I'll gladly put all my karma on the line for this one.\n\nShe made a promise to a child to be their parent. Kids don't just start bullying acting out without reason, Alex clearly was going through some stuff and it's not hard to figure out what, since it started right after Carter was adopted.\nIf OP adopts and gets some degree of custody she can get Alex the help she has needed for a long time, that her ex rejected.\n\nYou don't just get to just keep the \"easy\" kids and discard the \"hard\" one. It's heartless.", "She\u2019s only 2 years away from being an adult. I imagine the adoption process takes time anyways. Although I wouldn\u2019t suggest OP adopt her even if it is possible. She definitely sounds like she has ulterior motives for wanting this and she hasn\u2019t yet proven herself around her younger siblings.", "I tried to, but my ex didn't believe she was doing anything so when I tried for example taking away electronics he would just give them back to her.", "No, the kid ONLY wants the adoption now because OP has money and her Dad doesn't.", "\"Close enough\" doesn't usually work with legal requirements. You can't begin an adult adoption in any state (as far as I know) as a minor. So, not only is this a bad idea for many reasons, it may be practically impossible anyway.", "Then definitely NTA. Your ex enabled her awful behavior and it negatively impacted your other two kids. How she chooses to treat her siblings is on her alone now since she is not a little kid. If Carter is suspicious about it then he\u2019s probably spot on with what he\u2019s thinking. I\u2019ll advise you not to adopt her because you yourself do not want that responsibility. It\u2019s not gonna be good for you and if she mistreats her sibling again because of it then you will have made the right choice. Your youngest may be upset that Alex ignores her again but that will all be up to Alex and her father to fix that type of behavior.", "She is 16. She is old enough to understand that her previous behavior is making you wary. If you are considering this, there are several conditions you should require. This discussion should be had between just the two of you.\n\nShe needs to acknowledge the harm she has previously done. She needs to be able to provide a sincere apology. She needs to go to counselling, both individually and then eventually with her siblings. She needs to hear the hurt and damage she has caused to her siblings from their perspective. The two of you need to have some counselling sessions to discuss how she hurt you and your children, and how she needs to show she can behave kindly and follow your rules as her parent before she becomes your child. You and your ex need to also have some mediated sessions to ensure that he is not going to undermine your parenting going forward.\n\nThis is a lot of work for this 16 year old. You are NTA if you do not adopt her. You need to ask yourself if you would want to if she did the work. If you would want to, then lay out the work she will need to do to earn her siblings agreement and your trust. And don't forget the requirement to have your ex admit he f-ed up, there was something wrong, and he enabled it. If he keeps undermining, it will never work.", "YWNBTA but I'd honestly suggest family therapy to see if everyone can come to an agreement; it could be any reason as to why she's choosing now (regret, loneliness, force, deception, etc). I know the damage she caused is done but it's not too late to foster a relationship with her without adopting her. She's extending an olive branch & you have every right to be cautious or refuse it with her past behavior.", "NTA\n\nShe wants the adoption because her life isn't better now that she got her wish.", "INFO: Does your ex hate his kids? Like how did you end up with primary custody of his biological son? and now he also wants you to take custody of his daughter too?", "Your first thoughts are correct: this child is unstable and angry and capable of anything.\n\nProtect your kids and DO NOT GET INVOLVED WITH HER.\n\nIf you're worried about what she might do when your ex has them. withhold them from him and go to court to have his custody rescinded because of the danger to your kids.", "NTA. Especially because I would bet she will star being mean again to them once you adopt her, she clearly manipulative and needs counseling.", "Those kids know she is a bully. There is no way to save that. Don't adopt her. She doesn't deserve it nor is she really your child. Carter is. Loved you like a parent. She just wants to use you", "NTA. Why would you adopt her now?

If something is going on , do insist on family counseling before making any more changes.", "NTA and Carter and Emily should get a veto if you, ex, and Alex talk it over later and want to do it.", "NTA, but I\u2019ll give you something to think about.  I taught middle & high school kids for 34 years. I watched quite a few girls behave in really horrific ways for years until their sophomore year of high school (don\u2019t even get me started on how mean girls can be ages 11-16\u2013boys are a different discussion). Anyway, it\u2019s as if a magic switch was flipped in the middle of their sophomore year and they started to turn into decent human beings.  Some of my favorite former students were hellions in middle school and then turned it around in high school.  If I hadn\u2019t been willing to give them a second chance when they got older, I\u2019d have missed out on some pretty amazing kids.\n\nYou\u2019ve expressed concerns about Alex\u2019s motivation for suddenly wanting to be adopted and you have every right to be suspicious.  Here\u2019s how you find out whether or not she\u2019s really changed:\n\nTell her you are not going to adopt her since you\u2019re no longer married to her dad.  Fully explain the logistics of that and don\u2019t bring up her previous behavior unless she does.  Try to make it about the technicalities.  See how she responds.  If she gets angry, don\u2019t worry\u2014that\u2019s to be expected.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll argue. Calmly refute her arguments, then end the discussion.  She may be abusive to you.  Expect it and don\u2019t respond in kind (and try not to hold it against her as she\u2019s still young and her first response may not be her final response). She has a history of not managing her emotions effectively, and you should assume this is still the case\u2014at least with her initial response.  That\u2019s not the real test.\n\nWhat you ARE watching for is what happens next, once her anger cools down\u2014in other words, the FINAL response. How does she treat her siblings?  How does she treat you once the initial disappointment passes?  Give her a couple of months to adjust to the news and then check in with your kids to see what\u2019s happening behind the scenes. THAT\u2019S what will inform your next move.  If she is abusive, your gut was right.  If she treats everyone with respect and reestablishes a positive relationship with you, managing her disappointment in mature ways once she\u2019s had a chance to process, you could consider adopting her later, as a purely symbolic gesture, seeing as she is your kids\u2019 sibling.  Or not.  That\u2019s entirely up to you, seeing as she did a pretty good job burning bridges.  It could be a nice 18th birthday present, after she\u2019s had ample time to prove with her actions that she deserves the gesture.\n\nOnly time will tell if Alex is going to be a decent human being.  IMO, she may be worth the wait.  As I said, I\u2019ve seen some pretty amazing transformations.  Of course, I\u2019ve also seen some girls remain the spawn of Satan.  I think every kid deserves a second chance when some of the reasons for the behavior may very well be related to their immaturity and inability to manage their emotions.  Once they\u2019ve had a chance to mature, less grace is warranted.", "And that's on you guys not properly managing a blended family", "NTA. It is a little strange being that it's your EX but since you already adopted her sibling I could see it happening to keep the peace. Technically, I think you would only be legally responsible for Alex for another 2 years at most. Adoption could help with medical decisions in the future if needed.", "\ud83e\udd7a NTA. But my heart breaks for that kid. Something is terribly wrong.", "NTA", "NTA. You and her dad are no longer together. She\u2019s a huge part of that.", "NTA at all", "NTA - the circumstances are different now. You\u2019re not even with the dad anymore. Alex successfully caused you two to break up and now all of a sudden she wants you to be her mom? I think you\u2019re right that she sees what her siblings have/get and realizes she screwed up and now wants to play happy family.", "NTA.", "NTA. It would've been appropriate to adopt her while you and the ex were together, but doing it now is kinda odd.", "NTA. She\u2019s a manipulative bully.", "NTA. And DO NOT adopt her. It is more than a title being her parent. There\u2019s school, financial responsibility, medical care, problems with the police if she gets in trouble and so much more. Don\u2019t let her bully you or her siblings. I can\u2019t just hear her now, \u201cYou have to pay for my school trip to Europe bc you\u2019re my mom\u201d, etc.", "NTA, her behaviour towards her siblings was quite literally the cause of your divorce from her father. Why would you put your kids back in that situation?", "\u261d\ud83c\udffb\u261d\ud83c\udffb\u261d\ud83c\udffb\u261d\ud83c\udffb\u261d\ud83c\udffb", "How would this even work, anyway?  Wouldn't OP have to get remarried to her ex husband before they could even entertain this notion, unless they waited until Alex was an adult? I doubt most states would allow adoption of a minor to a *former* step parent unless something seriously bad is going on with the bio family.", "I seriously wonder if the ex didn't manipulate Alex into changing her mind. It's pretty suspicious that he started bringing Alex with him for the pick-ups/drop-offs of her siblings. And OP said that Carter himself has pointed out that Alex is acting weird, and he's old enough to be able to pick up on stuff like that. \n\nI think there's something else going on.", ">\"I miss you and have realized how much you mean to me, **and I'm ashamed of my behavior before and am incredibly sorry and regret the things I did and said,** can I come spend time with you?\"\n\nSeriously, the nerve of her. I get that she's still young but damn.", "If all of the parties involved want it, why wouldn't the court say yes?", "Depends on the state.  In my state (NH), its definitely a thing.", "Exactly!! Why even entertain the idea of adopting someone that has a history of abusing her kids. Even her son Carter is suspicious!", "I would have replied, \"Yes that was back when I was her stepmother and your wife. Now I am neither.\"", "Agree. They need to find out why Alex lashed out the way she did before anything is started. Alex's treatment of her siblings pretty much caused the entire family to collapse. NTA", "It's mostly because of his work schedule. It's not consistent like his old job and he often has to work nights. So it's better and more stable for the kids if they live with me.", "He may be the biological father but by adopting the son, she is his legal mother as far as the law is concerned. He's also of the age where his decision of who he wants to live with gets taken into consideration. Family isn't always who we are related too.", "Withholding the kids is dangerous if they have a custody agreement in place.   Judges look down on that a could get op less custody.", "THIS!!!!\n\nThank you Kirynn\n\nI had to scroll WAY more than I should have had to to find this comment", "Eh, tweens can be difficult even with good parenting.", "It won't keep the peace.  If OP does this, Alex is very likely to return to terrorizing the younger children as soon as it's official - and OP won't be able to protect them by making Alex leave.\n\nAlex's full brother is suspicious and apprehensive.  That alone is reason enough to say NO.", "Did you even read the post? It is very clearly explained that the dad didn't believe anything was wrong and refused therapy for the kid.", "in my state you can petition to adopt a child if the adoption wouldn't meet one of the qualifying requirements.  They *might* take into account that OP has already adopted her full brother and is the biological mother of her half sister, the adoptee is 16 and state she wants to be adopted, and her father is on board with it.\n\nNot sure it would work but, it could be tried", "Generally the law is that a single adult or a married couple can adopt a child. (Subject to all additional laws and considerations related to child adoption.) Two adults with no legal relationship are precluded from joint adoption in (all?) most states. A step-parent adoption uses a special process to allow only one-half of a couple to adopt a child (because the other member of the married couple is already the legal parent, generally with special rules related to terminating the rights of the other legal parent, if they still exist). Here, the child has a legal parent, and OP has no legal relationship to either the parent or the child. Not only is this not permissible under (most/all?) adoption standards (the same as having your girlfriend or neighbor adopt a child with you), but I can't imagine a court finding it in the best interest of the child.", "You could add the stipulation of therapy (family and/or individual) to this too. Let her prove she wants the family and not the money and as an added bonus (since you seem like a good person who cares about these kids) she may get the help she needs and hopefully make a permanent change in treating her siblings better", "I actually disagree. Alex has been very manipulative and hurtful for years to the point of triggering the events that led to your divorce (which is not only on her, but also your ex). That's a lot of damage. Don't give them the chance to do even more damage. At 14, 15, she was old enough to understand what she was doing.  She can very well act nicely only to get what she wants.\n\nIt's like your heart is in the right place and you mean well, but I think it's more important to protect the other two kids. She's had her chances and so did your ex-husband. I understand the youngest would like a relationship with her but I don't think she's old enough to get the concept of what manipulation and taking advantage of others mean. Carter is. If it doesn't work out or if Alex proves to be untrustworthy in the future, it will break her heart. I also think Carter deserves to be heard.\n\nIn fact, I would even see it as a YWBTA if you did that.", "and if you don't. I would get yourself a therapist who you can gameplan how to proceed with increasing access and signals and timeline that you are ready to increase access.  Something like\n\nwe have family dinners once a week (outside the house)\n\nwe spend the day together as a family (outside the house(\n\netc etc\n\nI'd say require her to get therapy, but forcing people into therapy isn't going to help\n\nand make sure you have frequent checkins with Carter (and Emily) to see how they are feeling and are they ready to move forward to the next step\n\nand you need to be blunt with Alex that she hurt the three of you and badly damaged all your relationships with her and that she needs to put in the work to rebuild those relationships and it will take a long time", "Get some sort of Nanny cam", "If you adopt her she will stay behaving like she did before once the adoption has finalized. Wait I until she's past 18, see if she can really keep up good behavior for 2 years", "Definitely not all.  You can do it in the 2 states where I'm licensed to practice (NH & MA) and I know there are others.", "Definitely therapy.", "She divorced Alex's father because of her behavior. Now they have no legal relationship. I think OP is right on the assumption that she is only interested in material things.", "Speculation. There could be a number of good reasons she wants the adoption. OP is suspecting the worst."]}
