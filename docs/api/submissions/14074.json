{"id": 14074, "submission_id": "12ctafd", "title": "WIBTA for not adopting my ex's older daughter when I said I would?", "selftext": "After my ex and I had our daughter, Emily, we decided to talk to the other kids about me legally adopting my ex's two older kids (Alex and Carter). Carter was really into the idea, but Alex was not. So we put it off. A couple years later Carter brought it up and he really wanted me to adopt him. So we decided that I would adopt Carter and told Alex that if she ever changed her mind I would adopt her too.\n\nAfter Carter\u2019s adoption was finalized things went downhill. Alex started acting out and would yell and get argumentative. She would hide, throw out, and destroy my things and blamed it on me being careless or on our younger children. The worst part was her being mean to Carter and Emily. I caught her often calling Carter stupid and otherwise putting him down. She would unplug his games and his saves kept getting deleted. She would completely ignore Emily to the point that she would walk through whatever she was playing with and say she didn't see her there. She would only act this way when my ex wasn\u2019t around and he didn't believe me. He refused to consider getting her into therapy or doing family therapy.\n\nIt got progressively worse over the years. Realizing that nothing was going to change and my kids were going to continue to live with their sister bullying them I decided to end things. That was last year and we have just know gotten our divorce finalized. I have primary custody of Carter (who is now 13) and Emily (who is now 6).\u00a0\n\nAlex (who is now 16) was at my place for the first time a few weeks ago. She came with her dad when he was picking up Carter and Emily for the day.\u00a0Since then she has come over every time my ex has. The last time she was over she said she wanted me to adopt her now.  After everything that happened I didn't think that was a good idea, so I said no. My ex interjected and talked about how back when I adopted Carter I had promised to adopt Alex if she changed her mind.\n\nI didn't want to get into it with Carter and Emily right there so I told them we could talk about this some other time and had them leave.  Truthfully I feel like her motivation to have me adopt her is just based on me having more money than her dad. I don't think she realized this earlier because she was never at my house before. Since the first time she was over she made several comments on how big my house is and how her dad can't afford this or that. I do know that my ex has been having a lot of money problems recently too. \n\nThe part that makes me feel conflicted is that I have learned that Alex has been nicer to Carter and Emily since she has been over. So  If I say no to her I'm worried about her being mean to them again. Carter is suspicious about how she's acting and says she's being weird, but I know Emily would be really sad if Alex started ignoring her again. Still I don't want to be legally responsible for a kid that I'm pretty is only pretending to like me and being nice because she wants things from me.", "created_utc": 1680719082, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ctafd/wibta_for_not_adopting_my_exs_older_daughter_when/", "score": 926, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You adopted Carter when you were with your ex - as a family.\n\nYou split up, and are not a family any longer.\n\nYou are under no obligation to adopt a child who is no longer part of your family. Why would you take on legal responsibility for someone else's kid **when you are no longer in a relationship with their parent?**\n\nI would say no. The offer of adoption ended when your relationship did. And Alex chose which potential parent she wanted to live with. She is 16, and old enough to learn that decisions have consequences. I'm sure that if you were all still a family, adoption would still be on the table. But you aren't, and it's not.", "NTA\n\nShe's mistreated you and the younger kids for a long time. You were still married to her Dad when you made that promise, you aren't anymore. There's no point in being nice to someone who has proven they don't give a shit about you. Once you have adopted her you can't go back and she probably knows that. I'm pretty sure her good behaviour would change really fast and the only thing that would happen is she'd demand money all the time. She's 16, she can learn a lesson about actions and consequences.\n\nPlease protect your younger kids from her.

She is 16yo, so that means she was a teen and going terrible things to her siblings.   Also she is your ex's kid, there is no reason for you to adopt her.   I hope her Dad got her therapy when she was acting out because she sure needs it.\n\nSorry ex's ship sailed when he did not do much to stop her bad behavior. His money issues are his to deal with.", "NTA. \n\nStep-child adoptions are a thing, but are former step-child adoptions even entertained in court?

If you're not open to it at this point, that's perfectly fair - just don't lead her on in that case.", "NTA \n\nIf and i mean BIG if you decide to go through with this before starting down the legal path, therapy/counseling is a non negotiable must that has to happen.

Tell her you are worried that based on prior behavior she will change back. That you will treat her just as you do the others but if her behavior goes back to where she is hurting her siblings she is no longer welcome to stay. This way she remains motivated to be kind to them and it could be a win for everyone.", "There's a pretty easy way to resolve this. Give her the opportunity to show she wants to be a part of your family before you will agree to adopt her. \n\nRefusing outright would make you an asshole. She's a kid who was going through a lot of changes. It's fairly common for the older sibling who remembers their other parent better to be more resistant to blending families.

I would like to know what happened to her mother.", "I'm of two minds on this one.\n\nYou are divorced, so adopting her now does feel a little strange, and her actions are a little suspicious. But breaking promises, especially to kids, is asshole behavior.\n\nAlso, I don't think you're reading this situation fully. Her actions, picking on her brother after he got adopted, ignoring the shared child, these actions scream jealousy. There's a disconnect here. To me, this whole thing reads... Wrong. Did their mother die, or abandon them? Why was there a thing about you legally adopting them at all? The way this reads feels like really important stuff is left out. Like, maybe this girl lost her mother, and felt like letting you adopt her was some sort of massive betrayal, so she said no to it... But then her brother had a full mom in you, the shared sister had a full mom in you, and only SHE didn't. So she started acting out, unable to deal with, or even understand, how she was feeling... And now she's gotten a little older, and sees what they have, she's more capable of coping with the feelings and wants you to be her mom too, because she always loved you and felt left out and wants to fix it...\n\nIt's really hard to say anything here, because it just feels like there's something really important absent in this. I can wholly understand you being suspicious, and wanting to safely test the waters, but I think you need to genuinely understand her motives before you reject her.", "ESH - why did you and your ex let that behavior go for years? it sounds like she needed some kind of anger management or therapy", "ESH\n\nYou're talking about Alex like she is a grown adult who had all this malicious intent against you... She was 10-11 years old when this behavior started - and she's still only 16! \n\nIt sounds like Alex's biological parents have failed her in a number of ways, and it's unfortunate that instead of having a healthy relationship with you, this is just another trauma in her life.", "YTA.

Do you truly view her as family and want to take on a mom role in her life?\n\nMaybe I\u2019m biased from my own experiences, but I could see Alex maybe feeling like she lacks security and a mother figure in her life. Since you seemed to have raised her through some difficult tween-teenage years, maybe she does view you as a safe person and wants to make amends.\n\nSometimes teenagers act out, especially if they\u2019ve had an unstable family life. Based on your post I think it\u2019s important to think about Alex\u2019s perspective and not jump to conclusions based on the shitty things she\u2019s done as a child that could be hurting inside.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously your right to make the decision to adopt and it\u2019s fair for you to say no. If there\u2019s a glimmer of hope that maybe what I said is true or resonates with you, you can always think about the decision and let Alex prove to you that she views you as family and not a financial asset.\n\n**TL;DR take time in your decision. There\u2019s not enough info about Alex\u2019s behavior and your relationship to warrant an asshole/not the asshole judgement (since your decision seems to be stemming from her previous actions).

Best of luck and I wish peace for you and the kids.", "Definitely have it in a neutral place.  This girl is manipulative, so be very wary of her.", "Yep, that exactly fits my guess.\n\nAgain, I don't disagree with you being suspicious and cautious at all, there's a lot of history here. But I think you should spend some time with her, and try to figure out how she's really feeling and what's behind her changing her mind. It's easy to assume bad intentions, humans have a severe negativity bias as a species, but reality is much more nuanced than that.\n\nI've studied psych with an emphasis in developmental psychology, neuroscience, and psychology of emotion, but I am NOT a certified clinical or counselling psychologist, and so I'm not going to give anything that can even pose as counselling advice here, this is just educated advice from a random dad on the interwebz, but I really think you should spend some time with her, one on one, and talk through some of this stuff. Ask her about her past behaviors, honestly explain they are making you somewhat uneasy about this situation, and explain that if it's going to happen you are going to have to rebuild trust and a relationship first. Maybe even book some sessions of family counselling with a professional, so you have a third party to arbitrate things. It's really easy for fragile teens (and all teens in general, because they are all fragile at some level in that stage of development) to take things really wrong and break. An independent, neutral third party to bridge some misunderstandings for you both can help immensely.\n\nJust because this seems like a sudden about face to you doesn't mean it's not genuine... But just because she might genuinely have changed doesn't mean you should ignore and disregard the past actions and put yourself and your other children at risk. Do what feels right for you and them, safely... But I don't think you should just reject her out of hand over her past actions without fully understanding her first. You may be risking damaging her emotionally even more, and yourself missing out on a lifelong loving relationship with her in doing so.\n\nEdit: Adding a verdict after the extra info - IMO this is a NAH.", "You are holding her accountable for behavior that you didn't correct while you were parenting her. You bear some responsibility and culpability for the way her life has turned out. \n\nHer biological parents are also to blame - but you've failed her repeatedly.", "Can't remember the last time I've been so convinced about my judgement. I'll gladly put all my karma on the line for this one.\n\nShe made a promise to a child to be their parent. Kids don't just start bullying acting out without reason, Alex clearly was going through some stuff and it's not hard to figure out what, since it started right after Carter was adopted.\nIf OP adopts and gets some degree of custody she can get Alex the help she has needed for a long time, that her ex rejected.\n\nYou don't just get to just keep the \"easy\" kids and discard the \"hard\" one. It's heartless.", "She\u2019s only 2 years away from being an adult. I imagine the adoption process takes time anyways. Although I wouldn\u2019t suggest OP adopt her even if it is possible. She definitely sounds like she has ulterior motives for wanting this and she hasn\u2019t yet proven herself around her younger siblings.", "I tried to, but my ex didn't believe she was doing anything so when I tried for example taking away electronics he would just give them back to her.", "No, the kid ONLY wants the adoption now because OP has money and her Dad doesn't.", "\"Close enough\" doesn't usually work with legal requirements. You can't begin an adult adoption in any state (as far as I know) as a minor. So, not only is this a bad idea for many reasons, it may be practically impossible anyway.", "Then definitely NTA. Your ex enabled her awful behavior and it negatively impacted your other two kids. How she chooses to treat her siblings is on her alone now since she is not a little kid. If Carter is suspicious about it then he\u2019s probably spot on with what he\u2019s thinking. I\u2019ll advise you not to adopt her because you yourself do not want that responsibility. It\u2019s not gonna be good for you and if she mistreats her sibling again because of it then you will have made the right choice. Your youngest may be upset that Alex ignores her again but that will all be up to Alex and her father to fix that type of behavior.", "She is 16. She is old enough to understand that her previous behavior is making you wary. If you are considering this, there are several conditions you should require. This discussion should be had between just the two of you.\n\nShe needs to acknowledge the harm she has previously done. She needs to be able to provide a sincere apology. She needs to go to counselling, both individually and then eventually with her siblings. She needs to hear the hurt and damage she has caused to her siblings from their perspective. The two of you need to have some counselling sessions to discuss how she hurt you and your children, and how she needs to show she can behave kindly and follow your rules as her parent before she becomes your child. You and your ex need to also have some mediated sessions to ensure that he is not going to undermine your parenting going forward.\n\nThis is a lot of work for this 16 year old. You are NTA if you do not adopt her. You need to ask yourself if you would want to if she did the work. If you would want to, then lay out the work she will need to do to earn her siblings agreement and your trust. And don't forget the requirement to have your ex admit he f-ed up, there was something wrong, and he enabled it. If he keeps undermining, it will never work.", "YWNBTA but I'd honestly suggest family therapy to see if everyone can come to an agreement; it could be any reason as to why she's choosing now (regret, loneliness, force, deception, etc). I know the damage she caused is done but it's not too late to foster a relationship with her without adopting her. She's extending an olive branch & you have every right to be cautious or refuse it with her past behavior.", "NTA\n\nShe wants the adoption because her life isn't better now that she got her wish.", "INFO: Does your ex hate his kids? Like how did you end up with primary custody of his biological son? and now he also wants you to take custody of his daughter too?", "Your first thoughts are correct: this child is unstable and angry and capable of anything.\n\nProtect your kids and DO NOT GET INVOLVED WITH HER.\n\nIf you're worried about what she might do when your ex has them. withhold them from him and go to court to have his custody rescinded because of the danger to your kids.", "NTA. Especially because I would bet she will star being mean again to them once you adopt her, she clearly manipulative and needs counseling.", "Those kids know she is a bully. There is no way to save that. Don't adopt her. She doesn't deserve it nor is she really your child. Carter is. Loved you like a parent. She just wants to use you", "NTA. Why would you adopt her now? Especially when you are no longer together with their parent and they were a big part of the reason you got divorced.", "NTA. Maybe a private chat with your ex to find out what is really happening?

If something is going on , do insist on family counseling before making any more changes.", "NTA and Carter and Emily should get a veto if you, ex, and Alex talk it over later and want to do it.", "NTA, but I\u2019ll give you something to think about.  I taught middle & high school kids for 34 years. I watched quite a few girls behave in really horrific ways for years until their sophomore year of high school (don\u2019t even get me started on how mean girls can be ages 11-16\u2013boys are a different discussion). Anyway, it\u2019s as if a magic switch was flipped in the middle of their sophomore year and they started to turn into decent human beings.  Some of my favorite former students were hellions in middle school and then turned it around in high school.  If I hadn\u2019t been willing to give them a second chance when they got older, I\u2019d have missed out on some pretty amazing kids.\n\nYou\u2019ve expressed concerns about Alex\u2019s motivation for suddenly wanting to be adopted and you have every right to be suspicious.  Here\u2019s how you find out whether or not she\u2019s really changed:\n\nTell her you are not going to adopt her since you\u2019re no longer married to her dad.  Fully explain the logistics of that and don\u2019t bring up her previous behavior unless she does.  Try to make it about the technicalities.  See how she responds.  If she gets angry, don\u2019t worry\u2014that\u2019s to be expected.  I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll argue. Calmly refute her arguments, then end the discussion.  She may be abusive to you.  Expect it and don\u2019t respond in kind (and try not to hold it against her as she\u2019s still young and her first response may not be her final response).

How does she treat you once the initial disappointment passes?  Give her a couple of months to adjust to the news and then check in with your kids to see what\u2019s happening behind the scenes. THAT\u2019S what will inform your next move.  If she is abusive, your gut was right.  If she treats everyone with respect and reestablishes a positive relationship with you, managing her disappointment in mature ways once she\u2019s had a chance to process, you could consider adopting her later, as a purely symbolic gesture, seeing as she is your kids\u2019 sibling.  Or not.  That\u2019s entirely up to you, seeing as she did a pretty good job burning bridges.  It could be a nice 18th birthday present, after she\u2019s had ample time to prove with her actions that she deserves the gesture.\n\nOnly time will tell if Alex is going to be a decent human being.

OP is acting way too butthurt over this kid's confused feelings over a new parent and normal teenage rebellion/sibling rivalry. Grow the fuck up.\n\nEdit: You don't promise things to kids and take them back later. This is so shitty and neglectful. This whole post screams of someone who is playing house with someone else's family. My opinion is that you should turn over custody of all 3 kids, begin paying child support, and commit to never having children again.", "NTA! You're not even with her Dad anymore, because of her. She just wants to be closer to your stuff. It's really weird that your ex would want this, but maybe he is going for child support from you for her? Or to pull you back into a relationship, since he's struggling?\n\nIt's terrible that Alex and her father stressed your family to a breaking point, but what's done is done. She is almost an adult. If she chooses to do so at 18, she can have a whole new relationship with you then. \n\nProtect your assets, BTW.", "NTA \n\nYou are no longer married to him or her stepmom. You offered to adopt her many times and she said no. Now that she clearly only wants your money. She wants to be adopted. Imagine if you did adopt her. She will still treat her siblings horribly. She did before. She will go back to that. This way they will be with you and able to get away from that. Where if you did adopt her they won\u2019t have that. She is seeing that the grass is greener on your side.", "NTA.\nNot sure the courts would accept you adopting a child that is your ex's when there is no medical necessity to  (i.e. he is very sick and won't be able to care for her soon).\nYou adopted your child a long time ago and since Carter doesn't want you to it seems I would go based off their feelings. Alex is a bully and trying to play you. They didn't want to see you until they saw how nice your home was by chance", "NTA - Maybe see if she is interested in seeing a therapist with you to work through why she was so mean earlier?", "NTA. Good god why would you even consider this. Don\u2019t do it!\ud83d\ude33 that kid caused your divorce! She wants money and stuff. She\u2019s not your responsibility and be damn glad of it", "NTA, but at the same time, maybe give her a chance to prove she is serious.  That means she goes into therapy, individual, and family with you and her siblings.  She takes responsibility for her actions against you three, and works to make amends, honestly.  Start with one outing as a family (minus the ex) once or twice a month.  If she asks, maybe one on one time with you, once a month.  Don't let her just barrell her way into all of your lives.  Also don't give her any money of she asks.  Watch her behavior, and how committed she really is then decide.", "You do realize she's being nice because she wants something right? And didn't you end your marriage because she was mean? So now that you are divorced you are concerned about something that was already happening? As JoJo said \"too little too late\" it would be weird to adopt her now, you are divorced. NTA", "NTA. Don't do it. She will be treating you like a bank. Tell them you can't adopt someone who was abusive to your kids and that her desire to be adopted now makes no sense. And stop her from coming to your house.", "NTA this child broke a trust you had in her when she treated her siblings so atrociously making you feel that they were unsafe in her presence. The fact that her brother your son says her acting nice is suspicious is another red flag. Your first instincts was no leave at that for now, offer to go to counseling with her and your other two children. If she turns it down your instincts that her motives weren't pure are right. Take your time don't rush to adopt because she & your ex are attempting emotional blackmail on a promise made prior to Alex's actions contributing to break down of the marriage. Be open & honest about how her actions hurt that therapy is needed to get past that hurt. Don't rush it say 2 years from now after therapy you have no hesitations adopt her. But do not adopt her when you feel the way you feel right now!", "NTA. Alex controlled your marriage. Don\u2019t let her control your divorce too. The offer for adoption was for when you were still married to your ex. If she\u2019s not nice to your kids then as the primary custodial parent, you have a say in your ex\u2019s visitation. That\u2019s the leverage you have over him to parent his eldest. Alex doesn\u2019t need to be super nice and bend over for her siblings but if she\u2019s outright hostile then your ex only gets supervised visits. Alex is 16. She can be left alone at your ex\u2019s house for half a day or so. It\u2019s sad that Carter is suspicious and Alex acting nice weirds him out. It speaks volumes about the abuse he\u2019s suffered at her hands over the years. Emily might be sad if Alex ignores her again but if that relationship is based on how much money you\u2019re shelling out, how long will you keep the gravy train running so Emily is happy? If Alex is in it solely for the money, the day you stop paying is the day she breaks Emily\u2019s heart. Better to rip that bandaid off ASAP so Emily can heal and move on.", "NTA, and I also think her behavior is suspicious. Especially since it seems she never received any therapy or help for what she was going through a few years ago. If you still want to foster a good relationship with her and her siblings, you could offer for her to stay over some weekends and see how long she maintains this new better attitude. Most people can only hide their true feelings/intentions for a few months. It's definitely way too soon to even consider adoption though.", "NTA and I have a feeling she'll go right back to being mean to Carter and Emily even if you say yes, because by then she'll have gotten what she wants, so she won't \"need\" to be nice to them anymore.", "NTA!", "NTA, you are no longer married to her father.  Depending on where you live you might not be able to.  Does she really want to be adopted by you or is she tired of living with just her dad. Not only is the house smaller and she is not getting this is there other reasons as well.  Is she looking for a dinner cooked every night and someone that does the laundry.", "NTA, don't teach Alex that manipulation and this kind of opportunism are rewarded.\n\nAlex already showed how deceptive they can be with the whole acting out of control but hiding it when dad was around.  Now they want to use you for better quality of life.  \n\nI know it's going to suck for the other kids if Alex doesn't get their way so drops the nice act, but long term it would suck way more for them to have an enabled manipulator who grows into a bigger manipulator and maybe even screws them over or uses them deep into the future.", "NTA  \nFrom my perspective this situation is complicated, but I do not think you are under any obligation to adopt her now the marriage is over. It really seems odd that your ex would even suggest it and want you to adopt her, to me it sounds like they are ones gold digging through Alex.  \nI will say though her behavioural issues may have stemmed from the loss of her mother and she didn't process it well at all and burned bridges with anyone who supported the idea of moving on after loss. She may have felt pretty betrayed by her sibling and your biological daughter. She was a child when that happened and is now a hormonal teenager. I wouldn't paint her as evil as many people here do, she's just a kid who's not coped well life and has developed a behavioural issue that needed/needs to be addressed. But that's not your problem to address anymore.   \nIf I was in your position, I wouldn't ostracise her for what she's done, but I wouldn't adopt her either, I would let her know that she is welcome to stay with you anytime and if she doesn't take that offer or reverts back to her bullying behaviour, then you know she's been convinced to take your money and its time for her to go home and let Carter and Emily decide on their own if they want a relationship with her.", "Nta ...you ended your marriage because of the kid and now that they can't afford nice things they want to be adopted", "NTA. Please, please don\u2019t adopt her. Your house is a safe place for Carter and Emily. That shouldn\u2019t be threatened or invaded by their horrible older sister.", "NTA! Alex has had 6 years to change her mind.  She waited until you were divorced from her father to decide she wants to be adopted by you.  Did she say she wants to spend more time with you and her siblings or that she regrets her behavior?  Or did she just say that she wants to be adopted now.  Whole thing sounds weird, especially since dad is into the idea.", "Check back in a few years and see how it plays out. Time will tell.", "NTA don\u2019t do it. Whatever her ulterior motives are, it\u2019s not to benefit anyone but herself. Why would you adopt her now when you\u2019re no longer family? The only connection she has to you is her siblings but you\u2019re no longer her stepmother. Why would you be responsible for her? Also, the fact that you got primary custody of a child who isn\u2019t biologically yours says a lot about his father. He ignored her behavior for years and continues to do so.", "Her mom and dad can't afford to pay her university tuition in a couple of years so she needs to find someone who can afford it and kiss their ass. She also probably wants a car. Don't fall for it. Stand strong and NTA", "I\u2019m just glad Carter has you protecting him", "NTA\n\nIt just sounds strange. I would wonder if your ex and Alex figure that if you adopt her, you can all let \"bygones be bygones\" and be one big happy family again. And then his money problems go away. Or, you adopt her and she stays with him, allowing him to ask for child support. Yeah, no. It makes no sense to adopt her now.", "NTA, the adaption was part of the relationship with your ex. When that ended, so did the offer to adopt.", "NTA", "NTA that ship has sailed I do not think you can trust her. She is going to be mean to them again whether you adopt her or not.", "I would be like do you not realize you\u2019re the reason me and your dad are divorced lmao why on earth would I adopt you? I would 100% have zero relationship with someone else\u2019s kid who ruined my marriage.", "Obviously NTA and her being nice is only temporary anyway. Maybe she\u2019s grasping at straws but who cares. She was the primary reason for the divorce in the first place. Now there is literally no basis for adoption. As if she would be grateful and start treating you all nicely if you did it. LMAO\n\nEdit to add, she would also be 100% likely to take any and all possible inheritance from you, away from Carter and Emily. I\u2019d guarantee it since she spent her childhood and a big chunk of theirs bullying them. This would give her extra legal means to do so for the rest of your and their lives. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA. She literally ruined your marriage. Her own brother sees through her. Do not trust this. She just wants the privileges of you having more money. She will drop the act and go back to abusing your kids", "NTA, that shipped sailed. If you were still with your ex it would make sense to complete your family. But, Alex changing her mind now doesn\u2019t make sense. She did not see you as a mom when you were literally living with her in the mom roll, but sees you as a mom now that you have moved out of the shared family home into a larger home of your own.", "Wtf are with these replies?! She\u2019s 16. This isn\u2019t some malicious Machiavellian plan she\u2019s been masterminding. She\u2019s clearly just a messed up kid.\n\nThe adoption isn\u2019t about money or a piece of paper - it\u2019s about security and belonging and knowing she\u2019s wanted. What happened with her birth mom? I\u2019d put money on there being some trauma for Alex there.\n\nOP, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re TA here because you\u2019re in a really tough position. NAH. But it doesn\u2019t sound like Alex was really old enough to make the decision about adoption when it was given to her - that\u2019s a decision for adults, and way too much responsibility to give to a kid. \n\nClearly seeing her brother get adopted was triggering for her, and whatever she was going through then started to come out in her problematic behaviours. Especially to her siblings, who *did* have two parents. See the big red flag there?\n\nI know it\u2019s hard to separate blame from behaviour but all that we know about child psychology tells us that this acting out is a desperate expression of some big unmet needs. You were absolutely right to insist on therapy and it\u2019s awful that she wasn\u2019t given it. It\u2019s good that she has you in her life.\n\nShe\u2019s a little older now, but her problems won\u2019t have gone away. This is a super delicate situation because it\u2019s likely that asking for the adoption was really hard for her, and being rejected is going to be incredibly triggering again. Because parental love is supposed to be unconditional, right? It\u2019s not meant to be *\u201cwell I WAS willing to be your mom when you were nicer but now you\u2019re not and we got divorced so I don\u2019t want you any more. Oh, but I\u2019m keeping your siblings as mine.\u201d Being a mom isn\u2019t an opt-outable job. \nAnd I know that\u2019s *not* what you\u2019re saying or choosing here, but you can see how it\u2019s going to feel that way to her.\n\nMy advice would be to offer to take her out for some 1 on 1 girl time to talk. Show her you love her. Make it clear that you\u2019re always going to be in her life and that you\u2019re excited to have an adult relationship with her going ahead. Give her the sense of security and belonging regardless, and she might stop wanting the adoption thing so much.", "What is her college application situation? Sounds suspicious like maybe she needs money for school.", "NTA\n\nYou divorced your husband and split your family because she was so adamantly against being adopted and you being a mother figure in anyone\u2019s life. Now that she feels let out she wants to be adopted? She doesn\u2019t want a family. She wants your stuff. From what you described, her behavior hasn\u2019t changed other than acknowledging your son and daughter. She hasn\u2019t apologized. She hasn\u2019t sat done with you to discuss why things have changed with her. She hasn\u2019t even made real efforts to get along with your kids other than not bullying them. She immediately went to ok you can adopt me like you\u2019re doing her a favor. This sounds like a ploy for your husband to get back with you and for her to benefit from your money. I\u2019m sure once she moves in, she\u2019ll treat your children poorly when you aren\u2019t around. Your ex had a chance to make things work and he chose to ignore your concerns, not believe you, and refuse therapy. \n\nTell her to get therapy or counseling first and you two will revisit it again.", "NTA, however I understand your concerns.  What if you expressed that you have concerns and would want to get family counseling first before making a decision.  I think family counseling is a good idea whether you adopt or not, because they are all siblings.  And you have over a year before you have to make a final decision", "Alex may very well go back to being mean even if she is adopted. If she is not sincere in regretting her behavior, she will go back to being mean to her siblings once she gets the adoption she wants.

Don\u2019t do this unless you want to do it now.", "NTA don\u2019t do it, if Alex wants that relationship, you can take baby steps. I wouldn\u2019t say be closed to it but maybe make sure she is getting therapy.", "I'm going against the grain here, but YTA. You divorce spouses, not children. I helped my Ex fianc\u00e9 raise his little brother (their Mom was/is an opiate addict) from the time he was 13 to 19. It was hard. As you can imagine, he wasn't used to adults giving a shit and setting rules and boundaries. I'd still help him to this day if he needed me.\n\nEven my alcoholic common law step daddy was kinder to me after he and my Mom split.

Find out their line of thoughts and perhaps share your own thoughts.", "NTA and maybe it\u2019s a jerk move but I would say that you would consider adoption after a year of family and individual therapy with Alex to make sure it was the best thing for her. Even if you don\u2019t want to adopt now she\u2019s still your kids older sister and therapy to work through those relationships will only be beneficial.", "NTA, but with a big caveat. If Alex started acting out immediately after Carter's adoption, it seems pretty likely she was alienated by being left out of the adoption process. Seems like both you and the ex were trying to be considerate of her feelings, but there are some years of resentment and left-out feelings to work through, even if she couldn't admit that she might have wanted to be adopted, too. \n\nI agree with all of the posters saying that Alex needs therapy, but it sounds like she might need a bit of empathy, too,", "NTA\n\nThink about it. Once you adopt her, she comes to live with you, then she re-starts her bullying bc she has gotten what she has wanted .\n\nYou will be removing your children\u2019s SAFE SPACE if you fall for this trap. Of course your ex wants the adoption to go ahead, he will come out of it financially better than he is now. \n\nHer behaviour will revert back once you say no (which proves she was faking it) AND once you say yes. This is a lose, lose situation. \n\nDon\u2019t do it.", "NTA. Listen to your intuition, if it feels wrong, it probably is wrong.", "Alex is still a kid, and was young when you and your ex joined families, so I'll give a bit of grace here...\n\nI think the first step would be \"you're welcome to come over sometimes during your siblings visitation and we'll work on an actual relationship.\" Second step, if you're even considering what will be close to, if not fully, an adult adoption would be therapy. \n\nYour marriage ended because of your ex's unfortunately to address Alex's behavior. Ultimately, you protected your children from Alex's behavior. Stopping now would be counterproductive to the actions you've already taken. \n\nYou've not lived with Alex since the split, so you don't know if the behavior has been masked, lessened, or stopped altogether. She's not tormenting your younger children anymore, which is good - but is she kind and loving? \n\nWas she a hurt kid or is she a manipulative teen/young adult? Hard to tell if you've not spent time with her. Also hard to tell if you don't have a third party to help you diffuse hurt feelings and current motivations.\n\nPast promises to a now broken situation don't count, I think. \"I will adopt you when you're ready\" can be off the table for a family unit that no longer exists, but \"I'm here for you (emotionally) if you want an actual relationship\" can still be possible. \n\nNTA", "Would she be able to adopt? You usually have to be married. At least that was my experience. I had to be married for a minimum of 6 months before I could adopt my son.", "I mean, even if she had honestly and sincerely changed her mind... that door is closed now. The offer for adoption was because OP was in a relationship with her dad, that Alex herself managed to destroy. Things have consequences.", "Considering I (29M) can I adopt my best friend (29F) if I wanted to so yes it's perfectly fine.", "Right??? I'm surprised OP let her in the house after the first time. I don't want my ex's abusive child snooping. Especially since Carter is leary", "THIS", "I mean if your real mom isn't dead then it's actually pretty hard for your \"consequence\" for acting out as a young teen to be permanent abandonment by a parent (or someone you thought had made a standing offer to be your parent.) \n\nBut yeah, let's celebrate a minor child having her self-worth and sense of security totally crushed.", "Yeah, this is a really good perspective. It would be weird for OP to adopt Alex at this point when he's split up from her parent, and I don't even know if/how it would work logistically. \n\nBut I reallllly don't get all the Alex hate and complete lack of sympathy a lot of people are showing here. This kid lost a parent and then had a new parent-figure enter her life. That would be pretty traumatic for a lot of kids and I get why she might have felt weird about the adoption, then felt weird about \\*not\\* being adopted. Then, this parent-figure who has been in her life for quite a while and who has said there is a standing offer to fully become her parent, e.g. someone who is always going to have a connection to her and is particularly going to have a responsibility toward her while she's a minor, decides to *completely abandon her* and to make matters worse *it's her fault.* Does anyone understand how much that must have wrecked her, or are we too caught up in calling her \"manipulative\" and \"abusive\" and saying she destroyed the family when she was at most a young teen? \n\nLike, call me a bleeding heart liberal but I don't think a minor child can do anything bad enough to justify total, permanent parental abandonment. I get that OP was a stepparent and stepparents don't always stay in kids' lives after a divorce, but it sounds like OP had been around for quite a while and the sibling adoption/standing offer of adoption definitely makes the bonds even closer. Hold her accountable in a normal parental/disciplinary way by all means, and do what you need to to protect the other kids, but don't wash your hands of her and absolutely shatter her self-esteem and sense of security just because she's difficult.", "This is the perfect response", "This is incredibly cruel advice. Why are we assuming this girl is evil and deserves to be toyed with rather than that she is acting out because she is damaged/traumatized by having a parent die? Now another parent has left her because of her actions as a young teen. Basically the stereotypical \"kids think the divorce was their fault\" thing is actually true for her, which has to absolutely wreck her self esteem! I get that it would be weird, and perhaps not even possible, for OP to adopt her now that she has divorced her dad, but stringing her along is only going to hurt her more and is an extremely strange, if not malicious, suggestion.", "Yeah, I don't get how it makes sense for OP to adopt Alex *now,* but I can't believe she is getting off so easy for the devastation she might have caused to this kid's psyche. Don't offer to be someone's permanent parent if you don't mean it! It's not normal for a consequence of young teen behavior to be that one of your parents leaves... and it's your fault. \n\nShe's already lost one mother and has obviously been pretty damaged by it, which is the clear source of her bad behavior. Then another mother shows up, wanting to take her mom's place. That's obviously confusing and upsetting, especially when the siblings have a mom and she feels left out and wonders if she made the wrong choice. But then that mom *also leaves* and if she has any idea of why that must crush her self-esteem and make her feel really insecure that anyone who is supposed to love her unconditionally will be there for her.", "I completely agree here. Sure, it could be partially motivated by money and materialistic things, but it could be Alex realizing OP was a good mom to her. \n\nAt 16, though, I would expect Alex to be able to provide some reasons for her behavior. I wouldn't consider this without a few family therapy sessions, including your ex.", "Yeah, thank you, all the hatred for Alex is baffling. She was obviously acting out because she already lost a parent and was having trouble accepting a replacement. \n\nAnd then the replacement, who had supposedly offered a parent's unconditional love, turned out not to mean it and blamed her for the fact that she left! So this girl has now lost two mothers and one of them was supposedly her fault, over behavior she committed as a young teen. That's so incredibly messed up! Actions have consequences, but when you're a kid the consequences should never be permanent abandonment by a parent (or someone who gave a standing offer to be a parent.)", "This is wrong, OP is responsible to protect her children from being bullied even and especially if the abuse is coming from another child in her custody. \n\nGiven her ex was undermining her prior efforts, in effect it was her duty to separate them the only way she could, which was by divorcing and getting custody. OP will be complicit in her children's further abuse if she lets Alex move in with them.", "It\u2019s not 100% fair to say this is a trauma as a result of op. It\u2019s possible Alex was happy with it just being her and the ex since she felt Carter betrayed her by being adopted and she avoided her half siblings. And according to op, Alex has made no strides towards showing she wants to be a part of op\u2019s family again through action. Just commented on material things then asked to be adopted. She\u2019s only commented on how big op\u2019s house is and how much more stuff her siblings have. Her own brother says she\u2019s acting weird. Which tells me Alex has kept being mean to her siblings and only stopped when she saw where they were living. I\u2019m not even sure op can adopt her. Her behavior towards the other siblings would come into play. They\u2019d ask why she\u2019d want to be adopted since she chose to live with her dad. There\u2019s no signs of abuse that says she should leave her dad. It\u2019s uncommon for a child to want to be adopted by the parent they hated and resulted in the parents divorce.", "Exactly! She was the catalyst in breaking up the marriage, I hope OP sees that.", "This exactly.  Do not put your children in harm\u2019s way.  She will go back to her old ways soon enough", "OT thank you TIL a new word, duplicitous.", "Except that she adopted the other sibling, who is now living apart from this sister. Who is actually caring for this kid?", "Right. Not to mention getting an idea of if this about face is legit or not. Because if it is because she wants the same things her siblings have there's no guarantee she won't enter a cycle of acting out & the behaving because once OP's her mom its not like OP can leave you know?", "It might not even be possible to adopt a minor while you\u2019re not married to the bio parent in your state", "But they only remained equal as long as they chose adoption?   \n\n\nEdit: Not to be too harsh, but was it necessary in order for \\*them\\* to feel like they were equal, or for \\*you\\* to feel like they were equal? Because it seems like at some point, you stopped seeing them that way.", "Thought I went a bit over board, my comments as long as her entire post lol. I just really wanted to make sure all bases were covered if she read it, so she knew the potential consequences beforehand. \n\nI\u2019m honestly shocked they even had the audacity to ask her after everything. I\u2019m honestly questioning if this is a money grab not just on the step daughters part but the dads too. Think about it - his wife leaves with the two kids because his daughters uncontrollable. Now he has to learn how to handle her himself and he has to do it without the money he grew accustomed to while married. I also think he knows if she\u2019s adopted OP wouldn\u2019t want her to live there full time. He has to be aware he would be eligible for child support from her.", "Then the whole idea isn\u2019t even realistic.

I was going to say set up a schedule for her to start staying over bit by bit and if once she\u2019s 18 you\u2019ve seen she\u2019s changed and want to - adopt her. That way if she changes after the adoption you have zero legal financial responsibility to her. But if you don\u2019t feel comfortable with her staying over then there\u2019s no real way to even test out her motives up close (because her/her dads word, time, and small pleasantries with you and the kids isn\u2019t enough to trust an adoption with her history).", "If you\u2019re not comfortable with having her there for an extended period, then you shouldn\u2019t be adopting her.

It aslo means access to the children Alex bullied mercilessly, as well as a chunk of any estate later.", "And he\u2019s having financial problems. \n\nI think it\u2019s a mixture of Alex wanting to financially benefit like her brother and half sister and the Ex wanting op back for monetary gain \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'm talking about Alex. It seems like the dad doesn't care enough to put her in therapy, but the forever-stepmom doesn't actually care about her well-being either. I think it's wrong to adopt one child and not think of the other like they're still your child, regardless of what the kid chooses legally. It's wrong to separate the children now based only on the behavior we heard about. I think giving the kids the choice about adoption is fine, but that should not change the way that an adult feels about both kids.\n\nThe key to me is that she talks about protecting \"her\" kids... as if she sees Carter as her kid but not Alex. That's fucked up, to me. When did she stop seeing Alex as her kid? When Alex chose, as a child, not to be legally adopted? When she started being mean to the kid who \"chose\" the new mom? Doesn't the promise of changing her mind any time imply that the stepmom's feelings about Alex aren't supposed to change after she says no?\n\nIf you choose to be in a kid's life, only the kid (or the kid's custodial parent, of course) gets to then choose for that relationship to end permanently. Once you commit, it's out of your hands, period. Because they're kids, not toys.", "OP is no longer her step parent and has no obligation to take that risk of allowing Alex to be an abuser to her siblings again or allow Alex to take advantage of OP\u2019s new home.", "You\u2019re not giving teenagers enough credit. Many teens are very emotionally mature, and on the flip side many can also be just as manipulative as an adult as well. \n\nA teen, who was 15 and being mean to children, should not be given a free pass for their actions. They shouldn\u2019t be condemned forever either, but it\u2019s not unwise to be cautious with a teen who consistently showed signs of being an abusive person. Yes, people can definitely change from who they were at 15/16 to a better person when they are older, but to think that a switch went off in her head over just one year to make her a dofferent person is not that likely, and she should be held accountable for causing abuse to her younger siblings. OP would not be in the wrong or an AH for protecting the younger siblings from a teen who more consistently showed more negative qualities than positive ones over the years.", "I understand where you are coming from. It's obviously a complicated situation. The onus shouldn't be completely on her. But Alex was just a kid."]}
