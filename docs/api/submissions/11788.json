I want to be clear about that. You have EVERY RIGHT to move out, and in fact, for your own mental health I think you SHOULD move out as soon as possible.\n\nBut I was you in many ways. Ironically, I was you but in the opposite position: I was disabled and living with my parents who, like your mother, infantilized me and treated me like I was still a child even though I was older than you are now, and made it incredibly difficult for me to become independent. Even my doctors (more than one doctor!) tried to tell them that I needed my independence and that they needed to start treating me more respectfully and like the adult I was, and they kept treating me like I was still a teenager. It was HORRIBLE for my mental health.\n\nBut what you're talking about: moving out \"secretly\", not telling her? These are the signs of the damage she has done to you and your codependence, and that in fact while you are taking good, healthy steps towards your independence with the help of your BF and his family, you are still behaving in other ways that are immature and childlike because that is what she has inculcated in you. She hasn't let you be an adult in her house, so you don't really know how to behave like one yet. And this is a huge sign of that.\n\nAgain, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't move out. But if you want to be an adult, you need to start leaning into that, and that means *owning your choices, and not acting like you're doing something wrong or you have to sneak around*. You're not a child. You are ALLOWED to move out. But you need to tell her, point-blank, that that's what you're doing. That's what mature adults do. They don't move out by stealth, even if their mom is controlling and scary and stressful. \n\nYou need to tell her, firmly, \"Mom, I know this is going to upset you, but I am moving out. I have found an apartment and it is happening on this timeline. You don't need to worry, I will continue to help you in the ways that you need support. But our household dynamic is no longer healthy for me, and I can't live here anymore.\" And no matter what she says or yells at you, you just repeat that. \"I'm sorry but this isn't healthy for me. I cannot stay. My mind is made up.\" \n\nYWBTA if you handle this like a teenager sneaking out. But I'm proud of you, and I believe you can do this the right way. Be honest and up front with her.

Different qualifying disabilities and treated me... Different. Idk exactly how to explain the treatment because he knew I had many things wrong, but I guess he didn't take it too serious. Once the disability studies got a hold of all of my medical documents,I went to one appt with one of their doctors and that was it. I was approved. I should have been getting disability a year before I actually applied so they back dated and paid me in 3 settlements. \n\nNTA, please do not let your mother emotionally abuse you anymore. It's fine to help get, but do not whale her disgusting behavior anymore.", "NTA and if she's that bad there's medical transport. I wonder if she ever will qualify. AND if she does, they back pay you from last date of work. Will she give you the money you've been putting out all these years? If not, then know you're being used.", "NTA. Go live your life. Your mom will have to \u201cfigure it out\u201d herself. You don\u2019t owe her anything. Not even her giving birth to you and raising you is a debt you owe. You didn\u2019t ask to be here. \n\nYou don\u2019t want to look back at wasted years that you could\u2019ve spent enjoying things you want to do. \n\nYou should tell her you\u2019re moving out though"]}
