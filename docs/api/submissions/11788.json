I didn't listen and stayed the weekend anyway. While I was up there my bfs aunt found me a beautiful apartment which I tend to get . I wanted to come home to discuss it with my mom but she blew a fuse because I stayed out all weekend and I have no respect for myself or her . That's when I decided I'm probably not gonna tell her and just move out slowly. My mom doesn't work so I'm not gonna leave her out to dry . I would still pay her bills and find her ways to her doctors appointment I would just be working 2 jobs but I still feel like this could make me a asshole in my mom's and families eyes.\n\nSo WIBTA\n\nInfo because y'all keep asking she's not on disability she applied for disability but got denied twice because she was missing doctors appointments because 1 we didn't have a way to her  there  or 2 because she just didn't want to go ( I was 17 and 18 at the times she applied)\n\nShe's recently applied for social security we're just waiting to see if she gets it", "created_utc": 1678286964, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11ly8lf/wibta_if_i_secretly_moved_out_my_moms_place/", "score": 31, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My mom has multiple health issues and I'm usually help her with everything so moving out on her is kinda of a bull shit move but I'm sick of being controlled. I would off to pay for her a live in nurse and even my bfs aunt said she would do it because she's already a at home CNA. \n\n2. I love my mom so much but I was already planning to move our by my 21 birthday the stress gets to me too much I would stay if she didn't try to control everything. Not like I'm leaving her broke and uncared for I just need my own space where I'm free to do what I want instead of having someone have something to say every five minutes is that so wrong.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your mom sounds like a peach! /s No, she sounds like she's living off of you. If you do leave, begin to wean her off of you. Like stop paying for things, stop running her life for her. She's an adult. She needs to behave like one and have some agency in her own life instead of stealing it from you in yours.", "I am 50. My son is 25. I am disabled and he helps me around the house and with things I can\u2019t do myself. It is just us two. He essentially acts like a caregiver in some respects.\n\nIf he were to tell me he wanted to move out because he can\u2019t handle it anymore, I would apologize for putting him through all this (actually I already do and tell him how much I appreciate everything he does), and wish him the best and tell him I hope he will still call or visit as he can, and I will do the same. Hell, I\u2019d even be happier for him, because I hate the thought of me tying him down from living his own life (he says he is fine though). \n\nNTA.

She may still need help, but there's no reason you should be shouldering this burden alone.", "NTA You shouldn't be supporting your mom at your age. Move out and find happiness.", "NTA. You are not a child you\u2019re an adult and you shouldn\u2019t have to ask your mother to go out or stay anywhere. The fact that you do so much for her and she treats you this badly says a great deal about her as well. I\u2019m certainly not saying you shouldn\u2019t help her, but you also shouldn\u2019t enable her. She should be able to contribute to her support in someway or other? You don\u2019t say which country she\u2019s in but if she is truly disabled in many countries, they were programs that would at least provide her with some support. In many countries, there are programs that would help with some home care for her. If she\u2019s truly unable to work at all, and she should have no problem getting medically approved for those programs. Definitely move out.", "NTA - I'm so sorry =( You don't deserve this treatment.  You have every right to just bounce.  You could literally just LEAVE and tell her nothing.  Not 'kind' but do you NEED to just go?  Will she try to hurt you?  Another option is to tell her, offer to help her, and if she screams and carries on...go.  You offered and she declined.  I hope you can get yourself some therapy.  This sounds complicated and difficult.  Codependency flags in my opinion =/ Big hugs and good luck!!!", "NTA, you need to live your own life. \n\nFind resources to help your mother. Senior living places, disability payments, etc. Talk to a social worker. (Mom may be too young for senior stuff.) \n\nGood luck and enjoy your new apartment!", "NTA but it is NOT your responsibility to financially provide or support your mother. That is her job. Do NOT run yourself into the ground working two jobs to take care of yourself and then her. You need to take care of yourself first and foremost. That includes mentally, emotionally and spiritually as well. Your mother can get a job and pay her own bills.", "NTA one bit, but I\u2019m very curious if she\u2019s on disability? She should be actively seeking out assistance from free or government programs, it\u2019s not ok that she has been relying on you for so long.", "NTA.  Move out and get on with your life. \n\nShe probably won't realize that she drove you out through her actions.

Were you planning to stay there your whole life and keep supporting her? Your 20! Move out and stop giving her money she\u2019s been an adult for a lot longer than you and should have figured out how to be independent by now.", "NTA - please don't support a woman that treats you like that. She seemingly has zero respect for you and doesn't deserve your hard earned money.", "I mean nta. But also your mom's making you an ah. As the child it is not your job to be supporting your household like this. She wants you to be the adult when it comes to working then demotes you to child when her whim sees fit. Incredibly toxic dynamic. I think it's very kind to still worry about her. But something more realistic needs to be figured out. Do you plan on working two or more jobs to support two homes forever? Do you think your partner will care? \n\nHelp your mom apply for disability, food stamps etc. Do not waste your youth tho keeping her kept especially when she's so entitled and ungrateful about it! Move out!!!", "NTA\n\nGo now. If she can threaten to kick you even though you are providing financial assistance, she must think she can get along without you; take what she says literally and go.\n\n Her mind games are blatant self-interest and she'll never stop using them. Go, now.", "NTA. Oh darling, how long have you been living like this. NO child is responsible for their adult parent. I know you're 20 and an adult now but your mother is NOT your responsibility. If she is unwell mentally or physically contact social services (I think it's called Adult Protective Services in the US.  I'm not a US citizen so I'm not familiar with your system)\n\nDo not buy into the \"BUT IM FAMILY\" trap. You are entitled to a life of your own. Go, leave, have a life.", "NTA. You should get out while you have a chance, because your Mom is unlikly to start respecting you now and won't want you to go. A pice of advise a friend gave me, that helped me deal with my own Mom: *\"Remember to take care of yourself first, you can't help anyone if you burn out yourself.\"* Move out, having your own space to relax in can do wonders for your mental health.", "NTA. You are an adult and you should be allowed to live your own life. If she has this little respect for you regardless of the sacrifices you have made to take care of her than this is not a healthy environment for you. You will never get your years back and you will learn to resent your mother even more. I personally don't think you should continue to pay her bills. There are a lot of programs like assisted living and income based housing that she could choose to transfer to.", "NTA but heads up - the aunt asking you to babysit is a \ud83d\udea9 make sure you understand the terms of this apartment situation. You may go from caring for your mom to caring for someone\u2019s kids. Don\u2019t feel guilty about needing \u201cyou\u201d time", "NTA", "Gently, **YWBTA.**\n\nNot for moving out. I want to be clear about that. You have EVERY RIGHT to move out, and in fact, for your own mental health I think you SHOULD move out as soon as possible.\n\nBut I was you in many ways. Ironically, I was you but in the opposite position: I was disabled and living with my parents who, like your mother, infantilized me and treated me like I was still a child even though I was older than you are now, and made it incredibly difficult for me to become independent. Even my doctors (more than one doctor!) tried to tell them that I needed my independence and that they needed to start treating me more respectfully and like the adult I was, and they kept treating me like I was still a teenager. It was HORRIBLE for my mental health.\n\nBut what you're talking about: moving out \"secretly\", not telling her? These are the signs of the damage she has done to you and your codependence, and that in fact while you are taking good, healthy steps towards your independence with the help of your BF and his family, you are still behaving in other ways that are immature and childlike because that is what she has inculcated in you. She hasn't let you be an adult in her house, so you don't really know how to behave like one yet. And this is a huge sign of that.\n\nAgain, this doesn't mean that you shouldn't move out. But if you want to be an adult, you need to start leaning into that, and that means *owning your choices, and not acting like you're doing something wrong or you have to sneak around*. You're not a child. You are ALLOWED to move out. But you need to tell her, point-blank, that that's what you're doing. That's what mature adults do. They don't move out by stealth, even if their mom is controlling and scary and stressful. \n\nYou need to tell her, firmly, \"Mom, I know this is going to upset you, but I am moving out. I have found an apartment and it is happening on this timeline. You don't need to worry, I will continue to help you in the ways that you need support. But our household dynamic is no longer healthy for me, and I can't live here anymore.\" And no matter what she says or yells at you, you just repeat that. \"I'm sorry but this isn't healthy for me. I cannot stay. My mind is made up.\" \n\nYWBTA if you handle this like a teenager sneaking out. But I'm proud of you, and I believe you can do this the right way. Be honest and up front with her. Trust me, in the long run you'll be glad you did.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
