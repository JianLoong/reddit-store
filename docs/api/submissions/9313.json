I proceeded to stand in front of the other bathroom. I did not speak to the woman while we were waiting but we were both standing there for a good while, I would say 5-7 minutes.\n\nDuring this time a worker came up and stood between the 2 bathrooms facing us as though he was waiting to run in to clean or restock one or both of the restrooms once they became free. He was pleasant and smiling/talking to my son and the woman's son while we waited. My restroom became free first and my son and I proceeded in.\n\nWe took a little while as we were changing out of our wet clothes into dry clothes, I would say probably another 5 to 7 minutes. When we exited the bathroom, the woman who had been waiting for the other restroom was next in line for my restroom and as she was passing me she began scolding me for cutting her in line and that I was teaching my son bad habits.\n\nI just kind of stared at her in shock speechless because she can't possibly be talking to me right?? We were both standing here waiting for these restrooms for a long time and never had she suggested 1 line for both restrooms.\n\nI figured the worker probably proceeded to clean the other restroom once it became free forcing the woman to have to wait for my restroom which I'm sure was very annoying for her since she had been waiting longer but how was I supposed to know that's what was going down? The worker never said anything to us about that while we were waiting.\n\nAnyways I felt bad but also irritated that she had been so confrontational towards me in front of my son who was also confused saying \"but we didn't cut her in line!\" I kind of wanted to find her after to correct the situation but you gotta pick your battles. Still, ruined the rest of the day for me.\n\nSo AITA for not offering the restroom to her first??\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT TO ADD:\n\nOther people were lined up behind of us, it wasn't just the 2 of us standing there. I mean, at first it was and she wasn't standing in the middle, she picked a door and stood in front of it. I picked the other door. My door happened to open first. I thought hers surely would be free soon. While the people in my line did let her go in next (because they are better people than me apparently) there was still a line in front of the other door when I exited the bathroom.\n\nAlso, I have been to this water park before and there has always been 2 lines for this bathroom.", "created_utc": 1675711528, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10vfio8/aita_for_allegedly_cutting_in_line_at_the_bathroom/", "score": 50, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She probably realized that as soon as you stood in front of the other instead of behind her in the middle, so that was the first kind of AH move. Then she's wondering, if the other becomes available, will she be kind and let me go?  If she doesn't no bother, I stood in front of this one because I saw someone go in the other one while this was closed, so it will probably open soon. But THEN you see the maintenance person. And when your bathroom door opens up, and he doesn't go for it, you KNOW he's there to clean the other bathroom. You know this mother will have to wait for the person in it to finish AND for it to be cleaned for it to be her turn. At that moment, I would have let her go, and moved to the middle. You would have wanted to be treated that way. That would have been a better model for treating others for your children than hey lady - sucks to suck.", "Going to say\u2026 NAH.\n\nWhen it comes to being in queue, you kind of have a sense of who is next.

From yr description, you were each standing in front of separate doors. so why would you be an AH if your door opened first?", "NAH. This is a grey area. You probably should have offered, but I don't think you have to in that situation, especially if she's lined up in front of one specific door. That said, I can also understand why she's upset. She's just waited 15+ minutes with her child to use a bathroom! I'd be pissed too.", "NAH, simple misunderstanding. If she was the only one person there the line system could've gone either way. Easy to not think about/make assumptions for both parties.\n\nI will say that *in general* if someone was there before me and I'm going in first I'll offer them my spot, but it's not really necessary and if I had kids I'm not sure I'd do the same, especially if separate lines had formed behind me. Wouldn't worry about it.", "NTA you were confused", "Makes a line in front of one door, but then tries to deem she\u2019s in line for all the bathrooms?
