Does she really think that a mess of feathers is more important than the loss of your mother?  That\u2019s horrible.  Sounds like a well deserved \u2018fuck off\u2019 to me, and you\u2019re better off without her.", "NTA, but she's already done you a favor and cut off contact. Just move on with your life.", "NTA\nWho calls somebody who just lost their mum a crybaby?", "NTA she was being insensitive and hounding you after a fresh loss. If it is customary for your community to feed you and comfort you, I'd assume cleaning up the place is also a part of that because cleaning can be a struggle in a time like this. Her efforts come off as disingenuous and she is being stubborn about it. If it bothered her that much and she was truly there to be there for you, she would have helped clean it up.", "N.t.a.\n\nTroll her at every family event, if she wants to act like you dont exist, I'd be the most obnoxious person to her ever!!!!!", "NTA, it wasn't her house and you had just lost your mom.  Auntie needed to take the entire couch and keep her mouth to herself.", "Shes a huge cunting asshole. Your family should should've stuck up for you and told the aunt off. It's not even her house where this \"mess\" occurred, even if your mum didn't just pass, she should've minded her business.", "NTA - she's already done you a huge favor but cutting you out of her life.  Don't scorn a gift like that.  So sorry about your mom and that you had to deal with such an AH while trying to cope with your loss.", "NTA.\n\nThis is actually a 'thing' you'll see more of as you go through life. You'll have something happen to you that makes you the centre of attention, in this case, your mother dying. People like your aunt get jealous of the attention and do mental shit like this to act out. \n\nI think you should ask around people you know looking for other stories like this so you feel less alone. Most people you know will have stories like this from after a death of a very close loved one, or after they had a near death experience or got seriously injured or something traumatic happened to them.\n\nOf course it could also be deflection to get you on the defence or distract you, lots of crime gets committed after someone dies like theft from the estate, fraud, etc. You'll want to think about if you had any items go missing or there was anything weird on your mom's bank account", "NTA. I had an aunt tell me the day my dad died that he was a terrible parent and the next time she complained to me about something, I didn't apologize as I usually did to keep the peace. She did something similar and it's the best I've felt in a while. Toxic people don't deserve you to second guess your response to their coldness just because they are family.", "You don't need someone like this in your life, who just criticizes you after the death of your mother.NTA\n\nAnd the thing with the family gatherings, just start hosting your own and don't invite her and see how quickly she will acknowledge you.", "NTA you were grieving.", "The people on your res isolated your mother because of something she had no control over? Who blames a baby, & then that baby as an adult, for being born?", "NTA. And please, let her the way It is, you are better without her in your Life. She dont wanna Talk to you, oerfect, she dont respect you or have any compasion on her.", "NTA fuck her. You did nothing wrong.", "The circumstances of her birth made her disliked? What in the actual fuck?  Nobody asks to be born... and she's disliked for it? \n\nI'm sorry to make assumptions, but I am assuming you are indigenous and living in north America. If I am correct(my sincerest apologies if I'm wrong), were they living on the same reserve? If mom lived on the reserve, she was part of the community, and should have been honoured by her community.... feather can wait. Dishes can wait. Laundry can wait. You are allowed to grieve your mothers passing how you need to grieve.\n\nNTA. Your aunt is selfish and inconsiderate. \n\nMy sincerest condolences on your loss.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
