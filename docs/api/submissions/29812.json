One of those changes was that everyone (full time) would take lunch from 12:30 to 1:30 so that we could have a more cohesive schedule. I don\u2019t like this change, but I\u2019m not the practice director. \n\nWe\u2019re not a huge clinic but we have a few doctors plus their support teams, so there are still quite a few people in office. Since we\u2019re in an office building with restaurants near by, some people will leave for lunch, however I rarely do, so I often use the microwave in the break room. \n\nI have a coworker (Jessica) who also often brings her lunch and uses the microwave. However,Jessica will often bring frozen meals, which is fine, but they take quite a while to heat up. Most take 5+ minutes without having to take it out and stir it and letting it sit. Since she is closer to the break room, she often gets there before I do leaving myself a few others to wait 5+ minutes while she finishes which cuts into our lunch time, especially if there are 4 or 5 people waiting. \n\nYesterday, she brought a meal that took 10 minutes plus constant stirring. She usually eats in the break room (I don\u2019t) so I decided to stick around and ask her if she could bring things quicker to heat or let others go first since I didn\u2019t want to add a passive aggressive note to the microwave. The only other people in the break room besides us two were a coworker/friend of hers (Amanda) and another employee so it\u2019s not like I singled her out in a group to embarrass her. \n\nShe did not like that I asked her to bring something different and said that if I had a problem with it, I should bring something else or leave for lunch, since it wasn\u2019t her problem. I told her that it\u2019s inconsiderate to others when we\u2019re all on a tight schedule and just want to enjoy the break we have and eat. Amanda  jumped in to say that she didn\u2019t mind and she knew other people who didn\u2019t either, so I was just being a jerk. \n\nI let it go, but this morning I woke up to an email from my boss (and HR) regarding the issue urging me to apologize for my \u201cinconsiderate\u201d (HR speak for asshole) requests and comments to a coworker. \n\nI didn\u2019t feel that I was the asshole in this situation but now that HR and my boss have brought it up, I\u2019m wondering if I really am an asshole.", "created_utc": 1698468465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17i69n1/aita_for_asking_my_coworker_to_bring_different/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

A direct confrontation like this was also the wrong approach - next time go straight to HR and outline the issues with the schedule and the strain on the lunch time situation. It's HR's job to address this, not yours.\n\nHer - She is hogging the single resource that is intended for multiple people to use and she's going first before everyone else, so she's using up time from other people's lunch break. If she's going to take 10 minutes to prepare her meal maybe she could consider letting others go first.\n\nWork - They need to supply adequate resources for the staff/schedules. HR should have been consulted by this change and proper measures put into place. With big changes like this there should also be a sort of trial period to review whether it actually works.\n\nIf you're consistently last, tell HR that the current situation means you are not able to finish your lunch based on the time restraints and you need the situation addressed.
