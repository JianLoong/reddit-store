I either put it in the fridge, leave it in my lunch cooler or out on a counter.  Thaws until lunchtime and heats up easily.   Or, maybe ask a couple co-workers how they feel as well, and go to boss for a second microwave, especially since everyone is now expected to eat at the sane time.

It\u2019s actually an important emotional skill to be able to just be assertive and direct. We live in such a passive aggressive culture it seems. I am so uncomfortable doing things like that, so much so that my therapist brings it up often. I get why she may have been embarrassed or defensive, as she really does have the right to eat that for lunch, but you are right about her being able to let other people go first. Especially for the 10 minute thing. Is there anyway a second microwave could be put in there?

The solution here is a second microwave.", "Sorry to ask, but what does E.S.H stand for?", "OP was an asshole because the problem isn't her lunch it's the office having only one microwave and only one lunch hour. 5 min is completely normal for food. Yeah 10 min is a little longer but again, this is the work organization's problem, making everyone rush and line up is stupid.", "Exactly. That is what I would do when bringing frozen meals. It cut down the time to heat them by half, at least.\n\nNTA. This would annoy me as well, especially every day.", "I take mine out of the freezer in the morning and carry it to work in an insulated bag where it sits all morning.

Doesn't seem like a good place to work tbh.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing with you, \nBut I do think that if her meal is 10+ minutes then offering to let the others go first is also a reasonable accommodation. Not that it\u2019s fair but it seems that this happens often enough to be a burden on their timeline. OP has EVERY opportunity here to bring food that doesn\u2019t need to be heated up or even talk to management by saying this is the problem before just dragging her co-worker. \nHowever I\u2019m leaning ESH because the co-workers response was very unempthatic. She can absolutely tell her to kick rocks but she should also understand that if someone else was there first and her meal took just as long that she would be waiting extra time to heat and eat her own meal. She could\u2019ve been more considerate by saying that she just tends to get there first and she\u2019ll try to be mindful of the line waiting (even if she\u2019s not) ya know?

It might be that she genuinely doesn't care and is that selfish, but it could even that she just hadn't considered the impact she was having on others.  Asking 1:1without an audience who could judge her, or asking HR to handle it in a more generic way, reduces the level of confrontation in most situations. \n\nWe had a similar situation in one of my work places.
