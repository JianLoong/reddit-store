{"id": 29812, "submission_id": "17i69n1", "title": "AITA for asking my coworker to bring different food for lunch?", "selftext": "At the beginning of this quarter, my office (medical clinic) made a few changes to everyday operations. One of those changes was that everyone (full time) would take lunch from 12:30 to 1:30 so that we could have a more cohesive schedule. I don\u2019t like this change, but I\u2019m not the practice director. \n\nWe\u2019re not a huge clinic but we have a few doctors plus their support teams, so there are still quite a few people in office. Since we\u2019re in an office building with restaurants near by, some people will leave for lunch, however I rarely do, so I often use the microwave in the break room. \n\nI have a coworker (Jessica) who also often brings her lunch and uses the microwave. However,Jessica will often bring frozen meals, which is fine, but they take quite a while to heat up. Most take 5+ minutes without having to take it out and stir it and letting it sit. Since she is closer to the break room, she often gets there before I do leaving myself a few others to wait 5+ minutes while she finishes which cuts into our lunch time, especially if there are 4 or 5 people waiting. \n\nYesterday, she brought a meal that took 10 minutes plus constant stirring. She usually eats in the break room (I don\u2019t) so I decided to stick around and ask her if she could bring things quicker to heat or let others go first since I didn\u2019t want to add a passive aggressive note to the microwave. The only other people in the break room besides us two were a coworker/friend of hers (Amanda) and another employee so it\u2019s not like I singled her out in a group to embarrass her. \n\nShe did not like that I asked her to bring something different and said that if I had a problem with it, I should bring something else or leave for lunch, since it wasn\u2019t her problem. I told her that it\u2019s inconsiderate to others when we\u2019re all on a tight schedule and just want to enjoy the break we have and eat. Amanda  jumped in to say that she didn\u2019t mind and she knew other people who didn\u2019t either, so I was just being a jerk. \n\nI let it go, but this morning I woke up to an email from my boss (and HR) regarding the issue urging me to apologize for my \u201cinconsiderate\u201d (HR speak for asshole) requests and comments to a coworker. \n\nI didn\u2019t feel that I was the asshole in this situation but now that HR and my boss have brought it up, I\u2019m wondering if I really am an asshole.", "created_utc": 1698468465, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17i69n1/aita_for_asking_my_coworker_to_bring_different/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's taking up a significant amount of time and causing other people to lose their break. If she wants to take 10 minutes to use the microwave, she should let everyone else who only needs it for a minute or two to use it go before her. \n\nAlso you don't know what she told HR, so you may want to speak to them and tell them your side of the story.", "The real asshole here is your boss. They make everyone take the same lunch time and only have one microwave in the break room? That's ridiculous.

Waiting 20-30 minutes for your lunch is insane.", "I second going to HR and telling them your side. You didn't make an inconsiderate comment, you asked. I'm really wondering why the others at work seem to be jumping all over you for it. You need to not let this set a precedent. If you apologize, apologize for possibly upsetting her, but make it clear you don't feel your request was unreasonable. And certainly speak to someone at HR and/or your boss first to clear things up.", "That frozen meal probably can be safely left in the refrigerator in the morning. That would significantly cut down on the time needed to microwave it.", "NTA. She should be more mindful since it's a common microwave. Hogging the microwave for 10 minutes when there are people waiting to heat up their food is excessive.", "NTA.  This is a very real issue.  The fix is to probably get a second microwave.  Or really be ready to run at 12:29.  At my old office there were a bank of microwaves but it still took forever because people brought in multi step meals.  \n\nCould you all keep a personal microwave in your office that you can use to heat up you food so it's ready by 12:30?", "NTA Although the biggest asshole is your boss. If they expect everyone to take lunch at the same time they need to buy another microwave. \n\nAnd as someone who hates to cook and eats a lot of TV dinners, WTF is she making? Most single serving frozen dinners I eat take 3-4 minutes. Was she cooking a Rice a Roni for 10 minutes or what?", "NTA for asking.", "YTA.  You have an hour.  She takes 5 minutes or 10 minutes to heat her food.  That still leaves you with 50 minutes. Ask HR for another microwave or bring a crockpot to work. In this day and age, there are so many options.", "YTA-unless you\u2019re her mother, or her actually, you don\u2019t tell people what they can and can\u2019t eat. And yes, you are the only one with the problem, since everyone didn\u2019t mind and you didn\u2019t even ask other\u2019s opinions, and you definitely didn\u2019t ask her in private.

Its not enough  and we have flexible lunch and can take it at any time but most people go between 12 to 130 so you can imagine the carnage.", "YTA for demanding someone stop using the microwave because you don't want to wait. \n\nThat's completely unhinged, and rather silly.\n\nA much more intelligent and rational move would have been to ask management if they can either rescind the blatantly silly lunch policy, or purchase more microwaves.", "YTA. However, it would be a good idea for teh practice to provide a second microwave.", "YTA. You have a management problem, not a coworker problem. Using a microwave for 10 min should be fine - and if there is a rush on the microwave all at the same time, the office should provide enough microwave ovens.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
