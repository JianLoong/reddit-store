Of course, this absolutely could be a tradition, and if that\u2019s what your mother and step father want, they are more than welcome to take it on. Heck, it could even be a nice family activity. Instead, they want *you* to do it, all on your own. \n\nI suspect this signifies a larger problem. Out of curiosity, do you take on a lot of emotional labour for your parents/siblings? Are there lots of things that you\u2019re \u2018expected\u2019 to do, because you\u2019re the eldest? If so, brace yourself. That\u2019s not something that will get better with the addition of new step siblings, especially if your mother is already this reactive. You do not deserve to be screamed at for setting boundaries, and you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about \u2018upsetting\u2019 your mother while she\u2019s pregnant. You\u2019re a kid, and that\u2019s verbal abuse, at the very least. I would highly suggest talking to someone - maybe someone on your dad\u2019s side of the family - who can have your back in real-time. \n\nI also hate to say this\u2026but maybe hide the journals for a while. You don\u2019t want your mum to have another tantrum about \u2018all kids being equal\u2019 and decide that the fastest way to equality is doing away with your journals altogether. I hope it doesn\u2019t happen, but better safe than sorry.", "NTA", "NTA, this is something for a parent to do. If your father were alive, he'd still be doing it for you and your brothers. \n\nIf she wants it done, she needs to do it.", "NTA.\nThis is something special your father did for you and your brothers.\nIf your mom and stepdad want their kids to have a memory journal, it\u2019s up to them as parents to make one, not you.", "NTA\n\nThese journals are to be made by parents, not sibs.  \n\nIt is NOT your job", "OP, you are NTA but you need to scan or photograph every page of your memory journals and then hide them! Possibly give them to a trusted family member who doesn't live with you for safekeeping for a while. Your mom's and stepdad's behavior over this issue is getting a little unhinged, and I worry they might try to take or harm your journals.", "It IS favoritism, but not the kind she thinks. It shows that your dad loved you more than their dad does, because their dad was too lazy to keep up the tradition for his own kids.", "That's cruel and selfish of your mom to do. It's like she doesn't even care that her OWN CHILDREN'S FATHER DIED.", "NTA and don\u2019t do it and make sure your brothers don\u2019t feel obligated to do it either. I hate when parents remarry and expect everyone to be on board with the new family. This is a tradition started by your father. You are in no way shape or form obligated to do this for the steps. Your mom and stepdad are the aholes for trying to guilt you into doing this. Unbelievable. Have a talk with your mom and explain this is a special o d between your brothers and you and your father and to stop berating you about it.", "Or \"The kids will be so upset their Dad doesn't love them as much as my Dad loved me and my brothers.\"", "Absolutely agree this is the best response.  \n\nI'm assuming based on ages, this isn't even logical for OP to do for the younger children. OP is gong to be headed off to college soon (possibly) and they will be busy starting their adult life and will miss many milestones anyways. At least I would think....\n\nAnywho......NTA", "Make sure those journals are safe and away from\nYour half siblings and your mom and step-dad. You never know what people may do in anger, a moment of selfishness or frustration. \n\nNTA! Good luck Op! Stay strong."]}
