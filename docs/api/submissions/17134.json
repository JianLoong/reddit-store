When my younger brothers (twins) were born 3 years later he bought one for each of them as well and did the same thing.

He had wanted to let us know about the journals so he showed us before he died and he added letters to us in them as well.

Your step siblings do not need to remember your late father, therefore they do not need you to take on their journals. Of course, this absolutely could be a tradition, and if that\u2019s what your mother and step father want, they are more than welcome to take it on. Heck, it could even be a nice family activity. Instead, they want *you* to do it, all on your own. \n\nI suspect this signifies a larger problem. Out of curiosity, do you take on a lot of emotional labour for your parents/siblings? Are there lots of things that you\u2019re \u2018expected\u2019 to do, because you\u2019re the eldest? If so, brace yourself. That\u2019s not something that will get better with the addition of new step siblings, especially if your mother is already this reactive. You do not deserve to be screamed at for setting boundaries, and you shouldn\u2019t have to worry about \u2018upsetting\u2019 your mother while she\u2019s pregnant. You\u2019re a kid, and that\u2019s verbal abuse, at the very least. I would highly suggest talking to someone - maybe someone on your dad\u2019s side of the family - who can have your back in real-time. \n\nI also hate to say this\u2026but maybe hide the journals for a while. You don\u2019t want your mum to have another tantrum about \u2018all kids being equal\u2019 and decide that the fastest way to equality is doing away with your journals altogether.
