He added ultrasound photos and baby/toddler photos along the way. He documented small and big things. Talked about his excitement and what he hoped for my future. When my younger brothers (twins) were born 3 years later he bought one for each of them as well and did the same thing. Each journal has a little animal on it which was a nickname he gave to us (mine is a  bunny and my brothers are an otter and a lion). Dad died when we were 5 and 8. He had wanted to let us know about the journals so he showed us before he died and he added letters to us in them as well. With his death, and with how my brothers and I were so upset, I decided to keep writing in my brother's and I wrote notes to my dad in mine. I still do it. My brothers know. They're 13 now and they want me to keep going until they graduate, so I will.\n\nMy mom remarried a few years ago and she and her husband have two children now with a third on the way. My mom and stepdad bought a journal for each of my half siblings and left it for me to start writing in but I never did.

Though my mom or her husband could do it themselves since they have the journals. He has asked me about it a few times. Wanted to know if I was interested in doing it for my half siblings and I said no. He was like you know it will hurt their feelings and I told him they don't need to know.\n\nNow that my mom is expecting soon she has been up my butt about the journals. She told me she wants me to do it for my half siblings to show that I am treating all my siblings equally and love them all equally.  I told her I am not. She said the memory journals are such a sweet thing and that my dad would have continued doing them. I said yeah, for his own kids. That he wouldn't have done it if they'd divorced and she'd had kids for someone else. She told me but I am the big sister to all the kids and could make it fair and equal. I told her that she or her husband needs to make the memory journals for my half siblings because I am not going to do it.\n\nMom started screaming and saying I am going to make my half siblings feel hated and she knows I don't really love them, she knows I don't look at them the same as my brothers and it's not their or her fault we don't share a dad and this is the least I could do. She then said I didn't even give a shit about upsetting her while she's pregnant.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683984864, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ghr1c/aita_for_telling_my_mom_she_needs_to_make_memory/", "score": 64, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was a thing that your father started, and you are keeping up in memory of your father.  This has no connection to the new siblings, and there is nothing continuing your mother from starting journals for them herself. She is being unreasonable, and her being pregnant does not mean nobody gets to say no to her. She is creating an enviroment where you will end up resenting your half siblings because of her.", "NTA for not wanting to do it, but I'm going to go a LITTLE against the grain from the moms point of view.  She is afraid you won't have the same bond with the new kids and she's right, you won't, but a moms fear is that they will be left out of the family.  I've seen some parents completely disregard the old family and choose the new one, then complete opposite in trying to integrate both and forcing love.  It's a hard one to meet in the middle!  Perhaps, if you are ready and willing, choose another tradition to start with your new siblings.  Half siblings or whole, they are still family and we all deserve to be loved.", "NTA", "NTA. I\u2019m making hand made scrapbooks for my kids. I only have one at the moment, though I plan to do it for all.

With my own scrapbook, I\u2019ve been taking pictures/scanning the pages so I could print them out later for myself. Since I plan to gift the originals to my children at graduation. I hope your mom/stepdad or even your half siblings would never stoop so low as to destroy these journals, but I would rather be safe than sorry. \n\nAs a doting parent myself, I want you to know it\u2019s really sweet what you are doing for your siblings.

This was something that a parent did for a child because he wanted to.

You are continuing a parental tradition, your half-siblings have both parents alive, therefore there is no reason for you to do it.

Doing it for five is a bigger project that you likely don't have time to do properly. \n\nAt 16 your world is opening up and you may be leaving home altogether in a couple of years. \n\nBetter to be honest now that this is beyond what you are willing and realistically able to take on than to end up disappointing everyone by not being able to complete the journals for the younger siblings.", "NTA but be careful, your mom might try to get rid of your journals since you refused", "You aren't treating them the same because you're taking your dad's place in doing it for your brothers.

Honestly if you have paternal relatives or nutraceuticals friends I would ask them to hold on to it.", "Honestly, they don't think the step kids are going to wonder later why their sister wrote it, not their parents, if you did?

She doesn't get that we didn't start these books, dad did, and I continued it because my brothers would never have the same strong memories I have of dad, and they deserve to have a connection to him that goes after his death. Mom views it as showing clear favoritism toward my full siblings over my half siblings and there's nothing right about that. It's why she wants to push me to do it. My brothers are even worried she'll try to get them to do it and they don't want to.", "Shes wrong though just because they wont have the same bond doesnt mean it wont still be a super strong bond. It will just be different and it would be different with or without the journals because op and her brothers share a loss that adds to their bond but they can still love and care for their other siblings and be close. What mom and SD are doing is whats actually going to stunt the bond because its very likely to cause op and her brothers to resent the whole lot of them. The journals are not on display its a private thing between the 3 of them the other siblings dont need to know.

It is very sweet of you to continue the journals for your brothers.", "Remind your mother that it was your father\u2019s project in the first place, one you kindly continued after his passing.
