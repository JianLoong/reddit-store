{"id": 13673, "submission_id": "1280f1d", "title": "AITA for kicking my bf out when he has nowhere else to go?", "selftext": "I (21F) started seeing James (24M) two months ago. Things started off really well. We have a lot of similar interests, and he seemed pretty normal. He talked about his mom a lot, but she's also the only family he has so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nAbout a week after our third date, he showed up on my doorstep in the middle of the day. He was carrying a trash bag full of clothes. I was surprised and confused, especially because I didn't remember telling him where I lived. Looking back, that probably should've been a red flag. At the time I assumed I must've told him and forgotten about it.\n\nI opened the door and James came in, asking which room is his and where should he put his stuff. I was still standing there dumbstruck with the door open, because we'd never discussed him moving in with me. We'd only known each other for a month. I asked him what the hell he was doing, and he looked at me confused. He told me he's sure he must've mentioned this, but his mom got evicted. She's staying with a family friend who doesn't like James. He claims he asked to stay with me for a while, and I told him that was fine.\n\nI asked if his family had a history of hallucinations, because we definitely did not have that conversation. James looked genuinely shocked. We went back and forth and he swore that he talked to me about this. In the end, he admitted he sometimes had very realistic dreams and mistook them for reality. He said he must've dreamed he asked me, and just assumed it had really happened. I thought it was super weird but since I did like him and he didn't have anywhere else to stay, I told him he could move in for a few weeks until he figured out something permanent.\n\nJames moved into my guest bedroom. We both had our own jobs with different schedules, so most days we weren't even home at the same times. We had dinner together when we could. Once in a while James would reference an event that hadn't happened, but they were small things and we always laughed about it.\n\nOne day, I asked him to get groceries because I knew he had the day off. He said that was fine and asked me to leave my debit card on the counter for him. \"Why would I leave you my card,\" I asked. That started a huge argument over whether he should have to pay for anything since this wasn't his house.\n\nHe stormed out, and I left for work. While there I got a call from my landlord. James's half of the rent for the month had never been turned in. I decided to do some digging. I discovered he didn't have a job, and that his mom hadn't been evicted but had kicked him out. That night when he came home, I told him to leave. He called me heartless because he had nowhere else to go, and said he had only lied because he knew I would need convincing. I put my foot down, but afterwards, my friends told me I shouldn't have done it. He would be homeless now because of me, they said.\n\nSo aita?", "created_utc": 1680298681, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1280f1d/aita_for_kicking_my_bf_out_when_he_has_nowhere/", "score": 224, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not because of you.", "NTA\n\nYou mean ex-boyfriend?\n\n1) Showed up to your home without having been informed where you lived - he likely got it from online or from someone you know.  \n\n2) Showed up without an invitation.  He did this to catch you unawares without a tangible reason to reject him moving in.  \n\n3) You've only known this guy for 2 months, after only 3 dates? Why is he your responsibility?\n\n4) He lied to you about the circumstances for which he found himself homeless to garner sysympathy. Classic manipulative move. \n\n5) He lied about having a job.  This should have been confirmed before even allowing him to stay. That means proof of having money.  \n\n6) He tried manipulating you to take your debit card since he had no money.  If you had left it to him,  he would have used it beyond what was reasonable. Or even pretend to have \"lost it\".\n\n7) He didn't pay his portion of the rent,  which will mean you will owe your landlord. \n\n8) Your \"friends\" can house him if they feel he should be.  Is also dump these friends. A real friend would tell you to run.\n\n9) Run!", "NTA. That sounds like a him problem, and you aren\u2019t responsible for another grown adult who lies and gaslights. Better you kicked him to the curb now before things got even deeper.", "NTA. You may want to consider speaking with someone with more legalese knowledge than I have, as well. Depending on how long he\u2019s been there, and if he\u2019s changed his mailing address to yours, you may need to involve your landlord. Also, I don\u2019t think it would hurt to consider going to your local police department, if for no other reason than to start a paper trail, if things go wonky on you. I might watch too much true crime, but\u2026yeah. Things can go sideways. (I saw that you already took steps with the locks, which is an excellent place to start.)", "NTA.  Your friends seem to be as delusional as James is.  James is not homeless because of you.  James is homeless because James is a gaslighting AH who has even managed to alienate his own mother.", "NTA. But you got used, abused and gaslit. Change the locks, block his number, and watch your back. Consider moving when your current lease is up. He is bad news.", "NTA. He lied. And he even tried to make you believe you agreed to him moving in! Idk what he expected to happen when it became apparent he didn\u2019t pay rent or have a job", "James is fucking crazy. NTA", "He was already homeless, you were just returning him to that state. What sort of drugs are your friends on that lead them to call into question your decision in any way?", "Obviously NTA\u2026 So many red flags about this guy\u2026 just not your responsibility, and you are safer, particularly mentally safer, with him out of your life let alone your home.", "NTA. Get better friends", "You just met a hobosexual, congrats!\n\nThey're experts at gaslighting.\n\nNTA", "And then change the friends.", "Also get new friends. Damn your friends suck.", "This is, without doubt, one of the few times \"gaslighting\" is being used accurately on this subreddit. Oh my GOD.", "I did say this in another comment but basically when i let him in we discussed his financial contribution. He originally agreed to pay half the rent for the month, which would've been $250. I had no reason to believe he wouldn't follow through, because it wasn't like we had a fight over it. And we informed my landlord that he was staying with me, so he knew to expect this", "If you're implying that I copied someone else's post, I didn't but you can believe what you like.\n\nIf you're making an observation about lazy guys who think they can mooch off of people in their lives just because, then yeah, you're spot on.", "To be fair I didn't know he was lying, or obviously none of this would happen in the first place. He also gave me no reason to suspect he was jobless, he took me out on dates and paid for everything. It was probably his mom's money, but I would've had no way to know that before. And I don't really \"owe\" my landlord, I would've paid the whole thing anyway if james had never been involved. I sent the rest of the money over when my landlord called me, it wasn't a big deal. It was just the catalyst to me finding out the things he hid from me.", "And friends!", "It's always nice when the trash takes itself out!", "Give your ex her address.  See how much of a heartless person she thinks you are with the tables turned.", "They were probably the ones who gave ex your address. He\u2019s a major manipulator.", "Getting conned by some guy you barely know is one thing, but who the heck are these friends? Can you get some better ones, maybe?", "My guess? Cheating, gaming with the bros, or dealing.", "Thank you, everything turned out fine. I\u2019m in a happy marriage now, but it could have been much worse. Just don\u2019t make the same mistake!", "It just seems like this is a recurring stereotype of hobosexuals. That\u2019s what I\u2019m implying.", "Omg and sorry to say but your freinds suck for that comment... please be careful OP and good riddance!", "James can move in with your friends", "Change the friends as well. Anyone giving you grief over this should not be in your life.", "He\u2019s an abuser. He started the gaslighting straight off the bat and the financial abuse soon after.", "If he\u2019s smart, he\u2019ll have two kinds of \u201cdreams\u201d\u2014the ones that magically get him what he wants, plus a few random, innocent ones to make it look less suspicious. \u201cHaha, I could have sworn we had a whole conversation where you told me you had a childhood imaginary friend named sparkles! Guess I dreamed that, it happens, lol! Anyway, what do you want for dinner?\u201d", "That's what i was hoping lol", "JFC, she needs to read that a million times over. This can\u2019t be a real post, wtf did I just read?", "20$ at home depot and a philips screwdriver, and you're done. 40$ if you want something nicer. Locks are surprisingly easy to install, and the price of a set of two knobs and deadbolts for front and back is broadly the cost of a single rekeying.", "Please do, he sounds awful and they are not on your side.", "They can house him then.", "This is a rental, so it\u2019s not up to OP."]}
