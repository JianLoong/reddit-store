{"id": 13673, "submission_id": "1280f1d", "title": "AITA for kicking my bf out when he has nowhere else to go?", "selftext": "I (21F) started seeing James (24M) two months ago. Things started off really well. We have a lot of similar interests, and he seemed pretty normal. He talked about his mom a lot, but she's also the only family he has so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nAbout a week after our third date, he showed up on my doorstep in the middle of the day. He was carrying a trash bag full of clothes. I was surprised and confused, especially because I didn't remember telling him where I lived. Looking back, that probably should've been a red flag. At the time I assumed I must've told him and forgotten about it.\n\nI opened the door and James came in, asking which room is his and where should he put his stuff. I was still standing there dumbstruck with the door open, because we'd never discussed him moving in with me. We'd only known each other for a month. I asked him what the hell he was doing, and he looked at me confused. He told me he's sure he must've mentioned this, but his mom got evicted. She's staying with a family friend who doesn't like James. He claims he asked to stay with me for a while, and I told him that was fine.\n\nI asked if his family had a history of hallucinations, because we definitely did not have that conversation. James looked genuinely shocked. We went back and forth and he swore that he talked to me about this. In the end, he admitted he sometimes had very realistic dreams and mistook them for reality. He said he must've dreamed he asked me, and just assumed it had really happened. I thought it was super weird but since I did like him and he didn't have anywhere else to stay, I told him he could move in for a few weeks until he figured out something permanent.\n\nJames moved into my guest bedroom. We both had our own jobs with different schedules, so most days we weren't even home at the same times. We had dinner together when we could. Once in a while James would reference an event that hadn't happened, but they were small things and we always laughed about it.\n\nOne day, I asked him to get groceries because I knew he had the day off. He said that was fine and asked me to leave my debit card on the counter for him. \"Why would I leave you my card,\" I asked. That started a huge argument over whether he should have to pay for anything since this wasn't his house.\n\nHe stormed out, and I left for work. While there I got a call from my landlord. James's half of the rent for the month had never been turned in. I decided to do some digging. I discovered he didn't have a job, and that his mom hadn't been evicted but had kicked him out. That night when he came home, I told him to leave. He called me heartless because he had nowhere else to go, and said he had only lied because he knew I would need convincing. I put my foot down, but afterwards, my friends told me I shouldn't have done it. He would be homeless now because of me, they said.\n\nSo aita?", "created_utc": 1680298681, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1280f1d/aita_for_kicking_my_bf_out_when_he_has_nowhere/", "score": 849, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And call th cops if need be!! Sorry.", "Sounds like he's homeless because of him, not because of you", "NTA, not only change your locks but change your friends!!! What kind of friends tell you to keep someone that manipulative in your life? Let them give him a room!", "NTA. Homeboy gaslit you right away. \u201cSuper realistic dreams\u201d ok, dude, yeah right. Change your locks and never talk to this toxic man ever again", "Get new friends! NTA and this  guy is pure solid evil. He lies and twists things, he is manipulative and cruel and lazy and deceitful and just so many other adjectives that I can\u2019t even start. Ok so this may have triggered me a little because I have epilepsy and I have quite serious memory blanks all over the place. Not just when I have had seizures either, the blanks can be at totally regular times but I just don\u2019t seem to remember things. My husband and I can have a bit of a laugh but it hurts and makes us both sad that he has to talk me through some of the stories of things we have done together and holidays we have taken and things like that too. I have had people try to use this problem to either tell me I had done something inappropriate or get something from me and it sickens me. I am lucky in that I am a strong personality and I know myself very well so while I have ended up doing some wild things over the years I do know where my line is and no matter if I have been drunk or anything else that line remains. I had people tell me I said something and I know very well I would never say or do anything like that ever. I know what my words and actions would be in a given situation and I find it vile that people would try to tell me otherwise. When I have called them out on it some have kept denying it but some admitted and gave reasons like they thought it would be funny (wtf?!?).\nCut ties and block him on everything, never engage with him again even if he is saying something that you desperately want to reply to. He will do this, he will say things that he knows you will want to defend for example just to get you to talk. Believe me when I tell you it will never be worth it.\nDo not feel guilty, he violated your trust and used you. He is 24, a grown man and he can sort himself out. It sounds like he has a habit of burning bridges but believe me when I say he will keep trying to work his way back. Keep yourself safe and explain all this to your friends. The only justification I can give for them saying you should have let him stay is they are young and naive and have not considered exactly what he did but if they still think that then block them too. You need friends who have got your back. Again - NTA and don\u2019t for one second let yourself feel anything other than angry about what happened.", "You\u2019re NTA, but maybe not so bright. You had the chance to not let him stay, but now he has legal rights since you agreed to let him rent. If you change the locks, he has the right to have the police let him in, and it could take you weeks or months to get him evicted legally. It doesn\u2019t matter if he never paid a dime, you made the deal without taking a security deposit. Now you know what that\u2019s for, I guess.", "You did the right thing,", "NTA. He also followed you home. Massive red flag. Lied to you. So many times. Red flags. Expected you to pay for everything.  Red flag. \n\nYOU ONLY KNEW HIM FOR A MONTH!!!!!\n\nREEEEED FLAAAAAG!!!\n\nChange the locks. Change your number. \n\nYou literally owe this guy NOTHING! \n\nIf your friends are so concerned about a lying manipulative stranger,  they can take him in!", "NTA. He\u2019s a bum. Plain and simple. Don\u2019t let a literal bum hussle you.", "Change the locks, get a ring camera, block him on everything. That man is unsafe.", "It's amazing how manipulative leeches find their way in no matter the kindness we try to show people.. Really ruins it for anyone looking for anything sincere whether friendship or relationship.. Blows my mind\n\nSorry for you having to go through that..", "Omg this sounds like a nightmare and is actually really dangerous. NTA and please stay safe and away from him. Guys like this will use and abuse you in every possible way.", "You were TA when you let him move in after he tried gaslighting you about a conversation that never happened. Get him out now. Out of your apartment and life. Nothing good will come from keeping him around.", "NTA.", "WTF did I just read?!?", "NTA change the locks!", "Well this is like a horror story \ud83d\ude05\nNTA at all. He manipulated you and honestly acted a bit creepy from the start of this situation\u2026", "NTA at all. Is he still your boyfriend? \n\nThis is not even normal red flag behaviour, it is very dangerous. To gaslight you in such a serious way so early on, he practically full on conned you. \n\nPlease distance yourself and try and get a restraining order (or similar).", "NTA- Even if I have compassion for James.\n\nFull on honest: I have had hallucinations that have landed me in the hospital. They're very fucking real when you're having them. It's very easy to be confused.\n\nIt's also really easy to check your bank balance and not lie to your partner,  even in the middle of a real mental break down. I managed to ride a bus to the town next to mine while absolutely hallucinating, wait for him to get off work and ask him to take me to a hospital. I have no idea how I did it.  \n\n\nHowever what you might be dealing is full on hallucinations OR he's lying to you.  \n\n\nEither way, NTA.", "NTA \n\nHe\u2019s homeless due to his behavior, and he manipulated you to move in. Your decision to kick him out is again due to his behavior and choices. He did this to himself.", "NTA and you probably already knew that. \"Convincing\" you should not involve dishonesty, for the love of god.\n\nI hope that things turn out better for him, but also that he leaves you alone.", "Be weird, be rude, stay alive! This man is a squatting grifter! NTA", "NTA. Watch \u2018Worst Roommate Ever\u2019 on Netflix. Seriously don\u2019t let random ppl live with you. You never know what could happen.", "NTA. This shit sounds scary. Please be safe and listen to people who seem to know what they're talking about down this comment section", "This guy is looking for a new mommy. Good on you for not just letting that happen. Dump him and never look back. NTA.", ">my friends told me I shouldn't have done it. He would be homeless now because of me, they said.\n\nOh look, your friends can put him up.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd take a good look at your friends here....  They're not supporting you.", "NTA\n\nGood for you for cutting him loose and I would consider doing the same with some of your dumbass friends. James isn\u2019t going to be homeless because of you. He reached levels of insufferable that his own mother couldn\u2019t handle! Letting him stay would have been the biggest mistake of your life and you\u2019d spend years suffering the consequences.", "Your friends are free to take him in.", "NTA", "nta but for the love of god open your eyes when you see red flags waving", "NTA - dump him and don\u2019t look back", "NTA AT ALL, and, frankly, your friends sound completely clueless about life. You successfully escaped a potentially dangerous situation. The very least, he could\u2019ve gotten you into serious debt. Good for you and good riddance.", "NTA. He's a freeloader and a manipulative liar. Pretty concerning that he knew where you lived without you telling him. His own mom kicked him out, so it sounds like he made himself homeless, not you.", "NTA - you\u2019ve stumbled upon someone who\u2019s probably a compulsive liar. Aside from anything else, after 2 months of dating and you not giving him your address, he showed up and forced himself into your home. Unbelievable. \n\nYou\u2019ve had a lucky escape, don\u2019t let him back under any circumstances. And show your friends who are criticising you these comments.\n\nJames is his problem, not yours.", "Jesus, what kind of friends think you are in the wrong here. He lied, found out where you lived, his own mother kicked him out, he doesn't have a job.\n\nYou dodged a major bullet here. Also look for other friends if they think this behaviour is normal.\n\nEdit: NTA by a long shot", "NTA. I was worried when reading this as I was expecting this to turn to some scam or abuse. Your friends are assholes too. And set yourself some boundaries - anyone asking to live at your place after third date should be blocked.", "NTA and I know everyone is saying it, but please be careful and stand up for yourself in the future.  His \u201cdreams\u201d were very self-serving, weren\u2019t they?  He is a manipulator and is probably already sleeping on someone\u2019s couch.", "Change your locks and your friends. Next time you see a red flag, lean in and take caution, don't ignore it. Read The Gift of Fear. NTA, not by a long shot.", "NTA. He lied with the intention of manipulating you. Gaslit you. Lied some more. And anyone thinks you're the A H? I don't see how. This is all his own doing. Look after yourself.", "Nta, sounds like this could have been a much more expensive lesson.", "NTA \n\nProtect yourself. This man, who should never have known where you live, turned up and moved in. That\u2019s not a red flag, it\u2019s bunting, OP. \n\nChange your locks.\n\nHe lied and manipulated his way inside, probably counting on the fact that you\u2019re a good person. It\u2019s not your job to save this man. He did something for his own mother to kick him out; I wouldn\u2019t feel one iota of guilt.", "Your friends are AHs for not paying for him since they're so concerned. Give James their addresses.", "It's the manipulation that is terrifying. this guy made up other hallucinations to back up his first lie. OP is just so trusting I want to wrap her in cotton wool. Who lets someone move in after three dates on this outlandish pretext?", "Then get new friends.", "Also, OP I would suggest monitoring your credit, if you don't already do so. \n\nI would also say, that if he is the type of manipulator this story portrays him as, then he likely puts people into this sort of position often.  And so, he may be quite rehearsed and comfortable making someone feel that they are forced to  decide whether he is in a bad state or not.\n\nWhen I encounter someone like this I try to remember that I am feeling guilty and uncertain because he/she is counting on that in order to exploit me. It is purposeful. \n\nThat helps me make decisions that may feel cruel, but are required to maintain fair boundaries and protect oneself.\n\nNTA!", "And get better friends", "Completely NTA\n\nAlso I\u2019m assuming theirs a big wealth disparity here, who tf has a guest bedroom at 21 \ud83d\ude02", "It\u2019s always better to be alive and safe over nice.", "Please OP! At bare minimum James is a user. He could be much more sketchy than that and he's had free reign of your house for the past month.", "GOOD FOR YOU !!!", "She's not your friend! And she's  not paying your bills. Bye-bye", "Stuff 'em both. Like others have said, they can live together. \n\nI also second the idea of changing all your bank cards.", "Suspicious AF. I think they helped him do this, it's the most logical explanation of him finding your place. They all fucking suck!", "Yeah, sweetie they were sick of being stuck with him. Please be careful.", "Please tell us you broke up with this loser and his loser friends. \n\nHe was outright using you, gas lit you, and lied, then tried to justify his lies and then attempted to make you feel guilty. Guaranteed his friends knew he was kicked out of his moms and that he never had a job. \n\nYou sound like you have your life in order for the most part. Don't let people like this derail you or take advantage of that!", "Sounds like a typical compulsive liar", "why do you keep befriending people in this family \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f girl stoppppp, just back away", "If you're renting make sure to inform your landlord as to why the locks are being changed and who he is (keep what you tell them within your lease terms for other people living there) send them an email with the details so there is proof you informed them in case he asks for a key amd somehow gets one or something like that so you could leave and have a reasonable case for breaking your lease if it were to come to that.", "NTA but perhaps your friends who are so worried about him have a spare room. Or they could have a whip around to pay his rent.", "And call your bank and get new debit and credit cards and change all your passwords. (Including the wi-fi)\n\nAnd check the house for hidden cameras and your devices for malware.\n\nAnd keep an eye on your credit report. \n\nHe was in your house unsupervised. I wouldn\u2019t trust he didn\u2019t do something *for himself* while he was there.", "I've never heard of any type of schizophrenia where hallucinations are always either innocuous or to the schizophrenic's benefit.", "Yes, OP, read the book The Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker!", "Someone please give OP a copy of the Gift of Fear. Jesus tapdancing Christ, this could have turned out to be a very very bad situation.", "Unexpected Ghost reference, well played.", "\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\udc80 I\u2019ve always loved this quote, especially when so aptly applied", "He probably tried the same crap with them and they thought you had taken him off of their hands and would be stuck with him.", "Maybe they knew he was a hobosexual", "So why didn't he ask any of them for support?  That's weird.....", "Do you think maybe they told him your address?", "Oh God, did he There's Something About Mary her? \ud83d\ude2d", "I mean, it may have been an ATTEMPT at gaslighting, but they both chalked up their disagreement to the supposed **gaslighter** imagining things, which... is not how gaslighting works.", "^^^^^^^^^^^^", "I live in a city with a lot of sort of grungey hippies and I was reading these comments assuming it was like metrosexual but for a different vibe.", "*Dude*, I was thinking the exact same shit and was so confused as to how that applied to the situation, unless he intentionally made himself homeless which didn't make a lick of sense?\n\nSo glad someone finally explained it and saved me a Google because I'm on mobile and my browser loves to refresh pages randomly when I have too many tabs open."]}
