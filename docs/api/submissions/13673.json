{"id": 13673, "submission_id": "1280f1d", "title": "AITA for kicking my bf out when he has nowhere else to go?", "selftext": "I (21F) started seeing James (24M) two months ago. Things started off really well. We have a lot of similar interests, and he seemed pretty normal. He talked about his mom a lot, but she's also the only family he has so I didn't think anything of it.\n\nAbout a week after our third date, he showed up on my doorstep in the middle of the day. He was carrying a trash bag full of clothes. I was surprised and confused, especially because I didn't remember telling him where I lived. Looking back, that probably should've been a red flag. At the time I assumed I must've told him and forgotten about it.\n\nI opened the door and James came in, asking which room is his and where should he put his stuff. I was still standing there dumbstruck with the door open, because we'd never discussed him moving in with me. We'd only known each other for a month. I asked him what the hell he was doing, and he looked at me confused. He told me he's sure he must've mentioned this, but his mom got evicted. She's staying with a family friend who doesn't like James. He claims he asked to stay with me for a while, and I told him that was fine.\n\nI asked if his family had a history of hallucinations, because we definitely did not have that conversation. James looked genuinely shocked. We went back and forth and he swore that he talked to me about this. In the end, he admitted he sometimes had very realistic dreams and mistook them for reality. He said he must've dreamed he asked me, and just assumed it had really happened. I thought it was super weird but since I did like him and he didn't have anywhere else to stay, I told him he could move in for a few weeks until he figured out something permanent.\n\nJames moved into my guest bedroom. We both had our own jobs with different schedules, so most days we weren't even home at the same times. We had dinner together when we could. Once in a while James would reference an event that hadn't happened, but they were small things and we always laughed about it.\n\nOne day, I asked him to get groceries because I knew he had the day off. He said that was fine and asked me to leave my debit card on the counter for him. \"Why would I leave you my card,\" I asked. That started a huge argument over whether he should have to pay for anything since this wasn't his house.\n\nHe stormed out, and I left for work. While there I got a call from my landlord. James's half of the rent for the month had never been turned in. I decided to do some digging. I discovered he didn't have a job, and that his mom hadn't been evicted but had kicked him out. That night when he came home, I told him to leave. He called me heartless because he had nowhere else to go, and said he had only lied because he knew I would need convincing. I put my foot down, but afterwards, my friends told me I shouldn't have done it. He would be homeless now because of me, they said.\n\nSo aita?", "created_utc": 1680298681, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1280f1d/aita_for_kicking_my_bf_out_when_he_has_nowhere/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I thought that was kind of obvious.", "That's not the point. YOU signed the lease, which means the legal consequences of whatever problem you have concerning your rent is YOURS, not his. You should've taken the money from him and paid the rent, not assumed he would pay his share God knows when \"because he said so\". You've know this guy for a month and not only allowed him to live with you but trusted him with something that could backfire financially on you alone. Besides, an adult who gets caught in a rough situation like the one he described to you should be crashing with a close friend, not asking someone they went out with 3 times to house them. That's enough of a red flag.\n\nYou're lucky this dude isn't violent, apparently. Don't let people pull the victim card and walk all over you. Put your safety first, ALWAYS."]}
