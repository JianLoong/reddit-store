Where you screwed up is by allowing it for ages and then suddenly going nuclear. By letting it happen over and over you made it normal, and then your opening is aggressive with \"fucking dog\". That other owner must have been like, \"Where is this guy coming from?\" The fact that even you could recognize that \"it was kind of a scene\" and that everyone else left the park makes it clear that you really blew up this simple request.\n\nSo he's an asshole for not controlling his dog, and you are the asshole for creating a scene that chased everyone out of the park.", "NTA: people need to teach the animals how to behave.", "ESH: \n\nOwner doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s an issue and he should correct his dog\u2019s behavior. \n\nYou handled the situation poorly.

Have a conversation with the oblivious owner rather than cursing and telling him off in front of a group of people.", "Nta", "ESH.   There are a lot of reasons that a lot of people hate dog parks.", "YTA - The very first interaction with the other other owner is to yell and curse at him?  Your approach was aggressive and wrong.  If the interaction really bothers (it sounds like the other dog really likes your dog) you, then go to another park or come to that one at a time when the other dog is not there.

It's unfortunate, but so many people don't give a shit about actually doing anything with their dogs and can let them get their energy out at the park. A dog once pinned my dog and bit her so badly that she was bleeding and yelped - still got a \"they're just playing\".", "INFO, why did you let this go on for so long? You knew your dog was uncomfortable but you kept bringing them to the park with this other dog, and didn\u2019t bother advocating for them?", "ESH but moreso you. The dog doesn't let your dog play with others? That seems like something you can assert control over. You can't get the dog to back up enough and let your dog be? That's when you calmly approach the owner and say that their dog is being too rough/aggressive/obsessive and could they please call it back and let your dog interact with others. \n\nIf you consistently say something and the owner downplays it, or you consistently try to mitigate the behavior and the owner does nothing, *that's* when you tell them off about controlling their fucking dog. \n\nI've never had an issue getting a bigger, more aggressive dog to leave mine alone except in one instances where the dog got really agressive and the owner had to put it back on its leash. Consistently driving it away usually will change the behavior.", "NTA \n\nConfront jinn every time his dog bullies your dog. Do it again and again. If he gets hostile, calm the cops.", "YTA- if that was the first time you had talked to the owner of this other dog, this was a dick move. Had you had previous conversations and the owner ignored your wishes then maybe I\u2019d feel differently.", "NTA, although blowing up probably didn't help.  Dog parks generally seem to keep a roster of A-holes so one is always there, so you need a strategy if you bring a small dog.  \n  \nYou might bring a small squirt gun and spray water in the aggressive dog' face and eyes.  If the entitled owner squawks you can show him its harmless.   If you need a stronger message you could carry a pocket pepper spray.  \n  \nI also find a hiking stick really useful for breaking up wrestling dogs without getting nipped   Outdoor stores will have one with a rubber foot that comes off to expose a metal spike for walking on ice.  You wouldn't use that unless you dog was actually getting injured, but reassuring to have.  \n\nIts likely a-hole owner will get huffy if you poke his dog with a stick, but you can just tell them you're just teaching the dogs to play nice, and to keep his away if it bothers him.   If he gets confrontational, pointy sticks and pepper spray work for self defense too.", "NTA\n\nThis is the guy who will run away the moment his dog draws blood or causes damages. He will claim he had no idea his dog could act like that. \n\nCalling him out was the right thing to do.", "NTA\n\nShe needs to control her dog which is exhibiting dominating behaviour. \n\nThe dog park is for dogs to play. Her dog needs correcting.", "NTA. That dog is rather obnoxiously trying to dominate your dog. The owner clearly has no clue about what\u2019s going on and should be paying more attention. If my dog was doing that to someone else\u2019s dog, my dog would be leaving the dog park and getting some better training on manners.", "I believe you have a legal right to protect your dog! Try a taser!", "Why dont you just kick the hell out of it?", "I don't do dog parks and wish I could.", "ESH. My experience of dog parks has largely been super positive. I\u2019ve also taken our dog to puppy play sessions, obedience classes, and generally socialized the living heck out of the guy. He\u2019s a fantastic dog. What I came here to say is that sometimes, the vibe at a dog park on a given day is just wrong. If you\u2019re paying attention you can feel it. Hmmm. I don\u2019t like this energy. Or, in your case, that darned dog is there again. What I do in those situations is leave. I cut my losses and avoid the energy I\u2019m sensing. Call me goofy if you want, but this situation is a great example. No one had fun. The more aggressive dog is never going to not come after your dog (if experience is any indication). Sure, you can make it even more awful and stressful by yelling at the dog\u2019s owner. But why tho? Just take your buddy elsewhere for the day. Your mileage may vary \ud83d\ude01", "ESH. you should have spoken up before to the owner about this since your dog seemed uncomfortable. The other owner should also do better to get his dog's behavior under control. \n\nI work at a dog daycare. A good portion of the job is making sure play stays fun, so dogs don't get overwhelmed or start a fight. I used to take my black lab to dog parks all the time. She loved to play with the ball, sometimes stealing others. I would always apologize and give their ball back. I never had an issue with another owner over this and if my dog did it more than once, then we would leave. I stopped going to dog parks after I started my job, however. I couldn't handle the lack of accountability of other owners with their dogs behavior(humping, this sort of bully play behavior)and I wasn't about to get yelled at for handling it for them. Overall, people at dog parks suck more than not. You're better just getting a long lead and letting your dog play in an open grass area of a park.\n\nEdit: typo", "ESH you, for continuing to allow this dog to bully yours. YOU need to protect your dog and stop taking her to that dog park when that dog is there. She's going to become dog aggressive and then you'll end up having fights on your hand. \n\nThe other dog owner needs to get his shit together and keep his dog off other dogs or there are going to be fights on his end.", "If you're watching your dog at a dog park (which you should) and you see your bigger dog pinning a puppy and the owners of the other dog having to push your Dogg away and telling them to go away, do you think that's them being Gung ho about your dogs behaviour?\n\nWhat about when you see your dog pinning a puppy by the throat and bothering another dog where they're hunkered under a bench just to get away?Or how they basically make it where another dog can't socialize at all?? How about being responsible and opening your eyes and watching an animal that's under your care??", "If him cursing is your idea of \u201cgoing nuclear\u201d then you live an incredibly sheltered life", "NTA.
