The owner needs to control their dog better and not allow it to bully your dog. I would have done the same too if my dog was being bullied and the owner did nothing.   \n\n\nI personally wouldn't take my dog to the dog park if that dog was there.", "ESH.\n\nYou are correct for wanting the other owner to control his dog. Where you screwed up is by allowing it for ages and then suddenly going nuclear. By letting it happen over and over you made it normal, and then your opening is aggressive with \"fucking dog\". That other owner must have been like, \"Where is this guy coming from?\" The fact that even you could recognize that \"it was kind of a scene\" and that everyone else left the park makes it clear that you really blew up this simple request.\n\nSo he's an asshole for not controlling his dog, and you are the asshole for creating a scene that chased everyone out of the park.", "NTA: people need to teach the animals how to behave.", "ESH: \n\nOwner doesn\u2019t realize it\u2019s an issue and he should correct his dog\u2019s behavior. \n\nYou handled the situation poorly. If this is a dog park you go to regularly and intend on going there again, you should have been more diplomatic. Have a conversation with the oblivious owner rather than cursing and telling him off in front of a group of people.", "Nta", "ESH.   There are a lot of reasons that a lot of people hate dog parks.", "YTA - The very first interaction with the other other owner is to yell and curse at him?  Your approach was aggressive and wrong.  If the interaction really bothers (it sounds like the other dog really likes your dog) you, then go to another park or come to that one at a time when the other dog is not there.  Not hard to figure out how to avoid them altogether.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
