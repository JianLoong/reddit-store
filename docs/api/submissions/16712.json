Before I even met my husband, Maddie\u2019s mother moved abroad. Maddie decided to go with her. My husband and I been married for 10 years and we have a 8 year old daughter \u201cAbby\u201d. Maddie visits us for the whole summer and 2 weeks in the winter. We go to her when Abby is on spring break. \n\nWe obviously save big family trips for when Maddie is with us. Same with any other \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d events. However, my husband is consistently reluctant to do pretty much anything without Maddie. I tried to be patient, but it feels like we can\u2019t do anything throughout the year until she gets there. \n\nAn example, we live near a water park. We have season passes and take Maddie all throughout the summer. But my husband refuses to go until Maddie comes to stay with us. And he doesn\u2019t want Abby to go as it\u2019s unfair. I\u2019ve tried discussing this with him but he won\u2019t budge. Sometimes I win him over but then he complains the entire time that Maddie isn\u2019t there. \n\nAbby loves Taylor Swift, who was going to be in the area for a limited time and before Maddie would arrive. My mom somehow scored us tickets and Abby was so excited. My husband said it wasn\u2019t fair because Maddie also loves Taylor Swift and she doesn\u2019t get to go. I said I\u2019d take both girls to another concert during the summer, as there\u2019s going to be a few other artists that I know Maddie likes in the area. My husband said it still isn\u2019t fair and tried to ban Abby from going. (Because I know it will be asked, it\u2019s not possible for Maddie to fly out for the concert. She still has school and important exams that can\u2019t be missed.)\n\nI put my foot down and said that life isn\u2019t always going to be fair. Maddie lives in another country. She is going to miss out on things. It\u2019s not fair to ask Abby to give up fun opportunities because Maddie can\u2019t come. I pointed out that Maddie gets to do fun things with her mom and Abby isn\u2019t there (which I think is completely fair). My husband said that\u2019s different, because his ex isn\u2019t Abby\u2019s mom, but he\u2019s Maddie\u2019s dad.\n\nEventually, he could see I wasn\u2019t going to give up and said yes to the concert. My mom, Abby and I attended and we had a great time. It was Abby\u2019s first concert and she loved it. \n\nMy husband says I bullied him into this and that if Maddie didn\u2019t get to go, Abby shouldn\u2019t. Maddie is disappointed she didn\u2019t get to go but seems happy for her sister.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683565710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13by5qs/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_miss_out_on/", "score": 5246, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband is illogical and slightly unhinged. One of his children lives abroad. Missing out on events and life experiences is par for the course. Life isn't on pause 8.5 months a year. He should be putting effort into making up for lost time when he is with his kid. He should prioritize their time together by planning experiences and family events when she's with him. He should not be preventing life from occurring while she is with her mother.", "Your husband is dense. Thick as a brick, and dimmer than a switch.", "NTA - your husband needs to work through his Maddie guilt before it effects his relationship with Abby and ultimately your marriage. I understand it probably sucks to have a child in another country but it sounds like he\u2019s doing everything he can to be involved.

It is amazing he is trying to use this straw man argument.  I could maybe see it if it was about saving money, and this was the excuse.  But both examples you gave, the money was already spent (already had season passes to water park, someone else got concert tickets).\n\nFirst, life isn't fair.  While you should be sure not to show favorites, sometimes one kid is going to go to a concert the other one wanted to go to.  That's life.  Also, you are correct that Maddie is having experiences and doing things (like the simple fact she lives abroad) that Abby won't.  That's also life.  \n\nYour husband is wrong, plain and simple.  He needs to stop this, it isn't right and it will make your daughter resent him.  Maybe he truly does think this way, but it is bizarre.  I think it more likely there is some underlying resentment you are getting these experiences with your daughter which he isn't/didn't/can't because his is abroad.  So instead of sharing and celebrating with you and Abby, he is trying to prevent it.  He needs therapy to sort through this, because it seems like there is an ugly jealous streak living in the subconscious or just below the surface.", "NTA. Your husband is being absurd. I would like to say, though, that I'd rethink your statement that Maggie \"decided\" to live with her mom. What was she at the time? 5? Hardly an age for considered decision making.", "NTA but might want to recommend some counseling.. maybe he's compensating for any hurt he felt when ex and child moved to another country.. so because he's still missing his daughter in his life more.. he's building up things bigger in his mind and emotions.. i don't think this is a straight forward issue.. but i agree with other posts that Abby is going to have issues too with this dynamic", "NTA he needs to get a grip and he's going to end up making the little one hate the older sister later in life behaving like that and only talking about the missing sister when she's not there and making the present daughter feel inadequate.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n... you know they have water parks in other countries, right?

As you said, Maddie and her mom probably doesn't postpone nice activities whole year.

Maddie is getting all kinds of opportunities when she is with her mom, but I guess Abby can just sit and read a book about fun places instead of going.

Without Maddie.", "NTA. If you don't start doing putting your foot down a LOT more often you're going to have regrets about it later. You might also have a child that isn't willing to spend time with you anymore.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being completely illogical. He is not involved in this concert at all.

I agree with your arguments up until this point. Once you marry someone, divorce should always, always be the last option. I think marrying someone should be just as grave and thought-out though. It's a very serious legal commitment to an individual. When you legally marry someone, at least in Canada, you are telling the government that you both are a functional unit, and your commitment to each other supersedes previous direct family bonds. Your spouse becomes your default enduring POA, capable of making all calls related to your health if you are incapacitated, and capable of compelling whatever bank you use to give them access to your accounts/finances if their case bears enough \"merit\" for the management to bypass privacy controls. Because that's actually all we (human women) really have with our bank accounts, especially if we made new ones when married with new married names: privacy controls. \n\nWriting, testing, and then implementing new code is very expensive in virtually all areas. It's much easier to tell the existing code to just ignore certain parameters and work around their values, than have to rewrite brand new code that doesn't include the nullified code to begin with.\n\nProblem? Everything. The more you adjust a system, the more you introduce variables. We've had a working banking system for decades that is based on men alone being permissable account holders. It's easier, and safer, to just add new permission cases, rather than rewrite the whole system based on new rules. But the outcome of this approach, which works beautifully initially, is that women are still weighted differently than men in the internal calculus.
