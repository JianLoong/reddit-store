Before I even met my husband, Maddie\u2019s mother moved abroad. Maddie decided to go with her. My husband and I been married for 10 years and we have a 8 year old daughter \u201cAbby\u201d. Maddie visits us for the whole summer and 2 weeks in the winter. We go to her when Abby is on spring break. \n\nWe obviously save big family trips for when Maddie is with us. Same with any other \u201conce in a lifetime\u201d events. However, my husband is consistently reluctant to do pretty much anything without Maddie. I tried to be patient, but it feels like we can\u2019t do anything throughout the year until she gets there. \n\nAn example, we live near a water park. We have season passes and take Maddie all throughout the summer. But my husband refuses to go until Maddie comes to stay with us. And he doesn\u2019t want Abby to go as it\u2019s unfair. I\u2019ve tried discussing this with him but he won\u2019t budge. Sometimes I win him over but then he complains the entire time that Maddie isn\u2019t there. \n\nAbby loves Taylor Swift, who was going to be in the area for a limited time and before Maddie would arrive. My mom somehow scored us tickets and Abby was so excited. My husband said it wasn\u2019t fair because Maddie also loves Taylor Swift and she doesn\u2019t get to go. I said I\u2019d take both girls to another concert during the summer, as there\u2019s going to be a few other artists that I know Maddie likes in the area. My husband said it still isn\u2019t fair and tried to ban Abby from going. (Because I know it will be asked, it\u2019s not possible for Maddie to fly out for the concert. She still has school and important exams that can\u2019t be missed.)\n\nI put my foot down and said that life isn\u2019t always going to be fair. Maddie lives in another country. She is going to miss out on things. It\u2019s not fair to ask Abby to give up fun opportunities because Maddie can\u2019t come. I pointed out that Maddie gets to do fun things with her mom and Abby isn\u2019t there (which I think is completely fair). My husband said that\u2019s different, because his ex isn\u2019t Abby\u2019s mom, but he\u2019s Maddie\u2019s dad.\n\nEventually, he could see I wasn\u2019t going to give up and said yes to the concert. My mom, Abby and I attended and we had a great time. It was Abby\u2019s first concert and she loved it. \n\nMy husband says I bullied him into this and that if Maddie didn\u2019t get to go, Abby shouldn\u2019t. Maddie is disappointed she didn\u2019t get to go but seems happy for her sister.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1683565710, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13by5qs/aita_for_not_letting_my_daughter_miss_out_on/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your husband is illogical and slightly unhinged. One of his children lives abroad. Missing out on events and life experiences is par for the course. Life isn't on pause 8.5 months a year. He should be putting effort into making up for lost time when he is with his kid. He should prioritize their time together by planning experiences and family events when she's with him. He should not be preventing life from occurring while she is with her mother.", "Your husband is dense. Thick as a brick, and dimmer than a switch.", "NTA - your husband needs to work through his Maddie guilt before it effects his relationship with Abby and ultimately your marriage. I understand it probably sucks to have a child in another country but it sounds like he\u2019s doing everything he can to be involved. He needs to stop worrying about that relationship and start being concerned with the relationship of the present child.", "NTA.  You are 100% correct.  It is amazing he is trying to use this straw man argument.  I could maybe see it if it was about saving money, and this was the excuse.  But both examples you gave, the money was already spent (already had season passes to water park, someone else got concert tickets).\n\nFirst, life isn't fair.  While you should be sure not to show favorites, sometimes one kid is going to go to a concert the other one wanted to go to.  That's life.  Also, you are correct that Maddie is having experiences and doing things (like the simple fact she lives abroad) that Abby won't.  That's also life.  \n\nYour husband is wrong, plain and simple.  He needs to stop this, it isn't right and it will make your daughter resent him.  Maybe he truly does think this way, but it is bizarre.  I think it more likely there is some underlying resentment you are getting these experiences with your daughter which he isn't/didn't/can't because his is abroad.  So instead of sharing and celebrating with you and Abby, he is trying to prevent it.  He needs therapy to sort through this, because it seems like there is an ugly jealous streak living in the subconscious or just below the surface.", "NTA. Your husband is being absurd. I would like to say, though, that I'd rethink your statement that Maggie \"decided\" to live with her mom. What was she at the time? 5? Hardly an age for considered decision making.", "NTA but might want to recommend some counseling.. maybe he's compensating for any hurt he felt when ex and child moved to another country.. so because he's still missing his daughter in his life more.. he's building up things bigger in his mind and emotions.. i don't think this is a straight forward issue.. but i agree with other posts that Abby is going to have issues too with this dynamic", "NTA he needs to get a grip and he's going to end up making the little one hate the older sister later in life behaving like that and only talking about the missing sister when she's not there and making the present daughter feel inadequate.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n... you know they have water parks in other countries, right? And other fun activities? And  you are right, of course Maddie certainly does some of them with her mom!", "NTA. It\u2019s hard when you have kids that aren\u2019t always together but I guarantee you Maddie is doing fun things whiles she\u2019s with her mom. Your lives can\u2019t be put on hold until she\u2019s with you. It\u2019s not fair to Abby.", "Please show your husband these comments. NTA", "NTA. Yes, you should make sure their is fun family stuff when Maddie is there. But that doesn't mean that abby can't have fun if Maddie isn't there. If he doesn't pull his head out, he's going to put a huge strain not only on the girls's relationship with each other, he's going to put a huge strain on his relationship with Abby, possibly yours as well.", "NTA, but your husband is AH no wonder Maddie's mom left him.", "NTA.\n\nThe longer this behaviour continues, Abby will start to feel like Maddie is more important to their dad.\n\nHe's trying so hard to make sure Maddie doesn't miss out that he's making Abby miss out.\n\nMaddie has her life with her mum plus her life with her dad and what, Abby is supposed to sit around and put parts of her life on hold? Missing out on experiences and chances to learn and grow in the mean time. Don't think so.\n\nYour husband needs to reassess how he's handling things or this could really harm Abby's future relationship with both him and her sister.", "NTA By your husband's logic, he should object to any fun activity Maddie participates in when she is with her mother because Abby can't go. It's not different, it's the exact same thing and he is letting his guilt negatively impact your daughter from enjoying her childhood. His daughters live in different countries and have different mothers, the daughter you share doesn't need to miss out because of it.", "NTA \n\nYour husband clearly feels some guilt for not being as close to his daughter as he wants to be but Abby shouldn\u2019t have to live a restricted life to appease him", "NTA Wow, OP should have hubby ask \\*his\\* daughter Abby how she feels about always having to wait on Maddie before she gets to have a life with her own social plans and activities. I get that hubby feels some sort of guilt but that's a \\*him\\* problem and he shouldn't let that hinder what Abby is allowed to do.", "NTA\n\nGood job advocating for your daughter since her father clearly doesn't prioritize her feelings. You should get the bottom line straightened out with him as soon as possible before he alienates his daughter.", "NTA. Point out to him that Maddie is getting to do stuff with her mom/family/friends that Abby isn\u2019t getting to do. If he doesn\u2019t put his foot down and ban her from doing that, he can\u2019t do the same to Abby.\n\nIf he keeps this up he is going to ruin the relationship between Maddie and Abby.", "It is entirely unfair to Abby to be refused an activity because Maddie can\u2019t be there. They are two different people. Is he going to tell Maddie she can\u2019t go to college until Abby can? His stance here is ridiculous. \nNTA", "NTA\n\nJust like Maddie does things with her mother, feel free to do things with Abby as her mother.\n\nWither your husband chooses to join or not is up to him.\n\nYour life should not be on pause, just because Maddie lives somewhere else the rest of the time.", "NTA, and it sounds like your husband has guilty feelings about one daughter living away from him. He needs to work on his relationship with Maddie, it can't just be an absence of things for Abby to even his feelings out.", "NTA. As you said, Maddie and her mom probably doesn't postpone nice activities whole year. The real unfairness here is to make your family sit and wait the entire year while nice activities and opportunities lay around within reach. Your husband is an AH. He has TWO daughters and should be looking out for the best interest of BOTH of them. He might have a soft spot for his oldest but he is neglecting his family.\n\nSome things cannot be helped and I'm sure your half daughter is way more sensible than your husband because she was at least happy that her sister got to have a good time.\n\nIf Taylor Swift was holding a concert near Maddie's town he would be happy for her to go.", "NTA but wow! your husband certainly is! He is showing blatant favortism to Maddie and creating a situation in which Abby will grow up resenting him.", "NTA\n\nHusband is a huge AH here.  Maddie is getting all kinds of opportunities when she is with her mom, but I guess Abby can just sit and read a book about fun places instead of going.  You and husband are both going to build resentment with Abby if you keep conceding to your husband's favoritism towards Maddie.\n\nPlease go talk to a family/marriage counselor.  Without Maddie.", "NTA. If you don't start doing putting your foot down a LOT more often you're going to have regrets about it later. You might also have a child that isn't willing to spend time with you anymore.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is being completely illogical. He is not involved in this concert at all. It has zero to do with him, so therefore has zero to do with Maddie. Your mother got the tickets for her daughter and granddaughter. You did no bullying at all. In fact, I would argue that he tried to bully you.", "NTA you are right and he is being completely is unreasonable", "NTA\n\nDo you all just sit on your hands on the couch when your step-daughter isn't around? Sounds like you go out of your way to make sure she is involved as much as possible.", "NTA. You include her when she's there, but life doesn't stop outside of the summer and the two-week winter break.", "It was also Abby\u2019s grandma that bought the tickets, not Maddie\u2019s. NTA.", "NTA like you said you can't expect Abby to only live her life in 2 months of the year. Try leaving the husband out of a few activities so it's \"fair\" that Maddie isn't the only one missing out", "NTA but he sounds like he favors one kid over the other and that's not the best thing for a father", "NTA\n\nYour husband really needs to rethink this. \n\nAbby will begin to resent Maddie for never being able to do anything fun without her. If she hasn't already noticed this happening, she will soon and will probably also blame your husband for favoritism.\n\nHe can't expect an 8 year old to never do anything fun throughout most of the year because Maddie isn't around. That's unfair and quite sad.", "NTA and if your husband isn't careful he's going to ruin the relationship between your two girls.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's incredibly unfair for her and honestly it may have negative affects during her childhood that will be very hard to fix later down the line. Your husband needs to get a grip.
