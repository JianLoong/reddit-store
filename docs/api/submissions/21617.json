My dad was raised with four sisters so living with women isn\u2019t a problem for him. \n\nWhen I\u2019m at home, I\u2019ll usually wear sweats and a big tshirt with no bra or if it\u2019s really hot sometimes I wear a big tshirt with bikini underwear or boy shorts. My dad owns a buisness so he comes home at weird hours. When he\u2019s home, I\u2019ll put on a hoodie or sweats/ lose shorts so my boobs aren\u2019t flopping and my cheeks are covered around him. If I have to leave my room and I don\u2019t cover up (IE big shirt and panties) and he\u2019s there he\u2019ll avoid looking at me or just make brief eye contact. He\u2019s never directly said anything to me about it but I can tell he\u2019s uncomfortable. \n\nS is still insecure about her appearance so she\u2019s covered up most of the time, even when my dad isn\u2019t home so I don\u2019t really care. Every once in a while she\u2019ll walk around wearing boy shorts and a big top but that\u2019s usually on her way to the shower. \n\nHowever, R has no care in the world when it comes to what she wears around the house. She\u2019ll be sitting in the living room watching tv wearing a bra and underwear like it\u2019s no big deal. When my dad comes home she\u2019ll put on shorts but still has her chest exposed. When I\u2019m doing things around the house and see her half naked I ask her to wear something a little bit more modest but she\u2019s pretty rude about it and tells me that she doesn\u2019t care and she deserves to be comfortable at home. Whatever, ok I guess. When my dad comes home he avoids her but she goes up to him and engages in conversation with him. My dad is respectful about it and cuts it short and goes into his room. He never explicitly says anything, but again you can see he is uncomfortable. \n\nEven when she knows we are expecting to have male guests (cousins, uncles) coming into the house she delays getting dressed and will come out to greet them in a bra and shorts. My mom, S and I are always on her to cover up but she doesn\u2019t get dressed until she causes a scene then she goes into her room to change.\n\nI reached my limit when I got home late last night to find her sleeping on the couch in her bra and underwear with everything on full display. I didn\u2019t say anything because everyone was in their rooms asleep but who knows how long she\u2019d been out there like that\n\nAITA for wanting my sister to cover up because of how uncomfortable she makes my family?

Also have you noticed a lot of young girls wear the equivalent to a bra and shorts out in public? A normal bikini nowadays includes the thong variety, too.

My 14yo lives in crop tops & shorts right now and no one has a problem with it. That being said, wearing just underwear & a bra is going too far IMO.

Some people are more sensitive to it without being rude.", "OP, Your youngest sister is rude.

Family shouldn't be looking at other family like that, aunt, uncle, cousin, Grandpa or grandma, doesn't matter. She's 14 she's a CHILD. I can understand being a little uncomfortable with her in just her underwear, but that's something to communicate with her not just tell her she needs to cover up. You're dad is creepy if he can't even look at or talk to you when you aren't fully covered. It's not a thing of respect unless you communicate. She can't be disrespectful if you don't actually have a conversation about it outside of \"cover up\". If you have to tell a child \"xxx is coming over, go cover up\" before family arrives, that person probably shouldn't be coming over.

Just factually speaking they cover the same so I just don't get it.", "Yeah that gets complicated quick lol.", "As a male,I never like to be the first one to point that out but it\u2019s a completely unfair,outdated double standard \ud83d\udc4d", "So are they uncomfortable any time they go to the beach or a pool? What\u2019s the difference between her being in a bra and panties vs a bikini? If it\u2019s acceptable in public, it should be acceptable in your own home. If the dad has such a big issue, he can say something", "They can avert their eyes. Physical comfort before aesthetics.", "I have less than no desire to see my relatives, any of them, lounging about in their underwear. Doesn't matter what gender, age whatever. Gross. Not sexual either.", "It\u2019s not even about gender at the end of the day. It\u2019s the fact that OP is sexualizing their family members. That\u2019s weird as hell. I could accidentally walk in on my sister naked and I would never think about her in that way. It\u2019s my fucking sister, like what. OP needs to stop being such a weirdo", "If you're wearing a bra and panties, your parts are covered. Where's the issue?", "If you view your family members in a sexual way, you\u2019re the problem, not them", "This is a fair take tbh. They need to have a family meeting. Stop with the \"I just know what someone else is feeling\" nonsense and actually talk to each other.", "It's the possibility of skidmarks and sweaty nastiness on the common area furniture.....teens sweat a lot....", "Well that sounds like a you problem, not a them problem.", "Grow up. Not everyone feels comfortable around people wearing little or nothing on. It's a boundaries thing.\n\nMy dad used to get pretty relaxed when I was a kid and wear nothing but ill-fitting underwear on around the house, and my siblings and I regularly yelled at him to wear some clothes at least. No one wants to see that shit.", "The dress code for being at the beach is not the same, just like it's not the same for a gym, or school, or mall etc. By your logic, it's ok to go grocery shopping in our bra and panties. Because it's \"ok at the beach.\" If her dad was walking around the house in a speedo, and refusing to change even when guests came over, we would all be in agreement that he's the asshole. So why is this different?", "Would you respond this way if the daughter was complaining about her father walking around the house with his private parts barely covered? Probably not.\n\n Everyone has a right to be comfortable in their home.", "It's still pretty naked. And for some people, that's ok, and for others, it makes them uncomfortable. We all have different levels of comfort around nudity. The majority of this household is saying they are.", "Nope. Not wanting to see your fathers/mothers/siblings private parts or almost naked is not sexualizing. It's the most natural feeling ever.", "Hey man, it's more of a boundaries thing than anything. OP lives there too, so it is a \"them\" problem. She's not comfortable and she said something. It's not that the sister is a child or female or anything either. I'm sure if the dad walked around in his underwear OP would be equally uncomfortable.", "Enforcing boundaries of conduct for the entire family is actually a good thing for minors.\nIt's called \"Child rearing\". \nYou should look into it.", "I grew up in a desert. Everyone walked around in their underwear. \n\nBut there's also the bit where OP said dad hasn't said anything about being uncomfortable. They just assume he is. If he's OK with this, then OP can stop trying to parent their sibling. If he's not, he will say something.", "I\u2019m sorry you sexualize your family. That\u2019s pretty weird. It\u2019s normal in many places to not be terrified to bodies. Maybe you should try being more open minded. What\u2019s the difference between a bra and a bikini? I\u2019m sure OP goes swimming with her sister. Does she tell her to cover up at the beach/pool? It\u2019s weird to even think that way about your family members. I\u2019ve seen my mother naked accidentally, never fazed me. Obviously I don\u2019t try to see, but why would it matter? She\u2019s my mother, she gave birth to me, so that\u2019s pretty fucking weird if you think sexualizing your family is normal\n\nYou\u2019re the problem. Not them. Stop watching so much porn maybe", "In my house we teach bodies are bodies. They belong to ourselves and ourselves alone. Anyone in the house can dress however they want - it does not detract from what we\u2019re doing because we don\u2019t sexualize each other. We don\u2019t notice. We don\u2019t care. Home should be a safe space where that kind of shit doesn\u2019t exist.\n\nThe fact OP IS PREOCCUPIED worrying about the effects of a teenagers body on her own father is a horrifying dynamic. Like. Yuck. Therapy.", "She said, \"Her Mom, S, and herself\" are always on her about covering up a little. Her mother is also complaining about it. She can speak on behalf of her husband. Not everyone is confrontational.", "I read that as they only get on her when she's delaying before guests arrive but I can see it meaning that way. Did mom say dad was uncomfortable? No matter how it's going tho, OP is not the parent. Either mom or dad need to be doing the parenting."]}
