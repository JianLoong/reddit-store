What you are asking for is whether you think it is fair to charge him rent.\n\nI think you are justified in charging him rent, but call it what it is.", "NTA but it\u2019s rent. You want to charge him rent. Which is perfectly appropriate. He should be paying half.", "NTA. Why do you call it *contribution to the mortgage*? It makes him think he owns part of the house. Call it rent.", "NTA, but perhaps phrase it differently: Instead of asking him to split the mortgage, ask him to pay rent. Figure out what a similar house would rent for, and ask him for half of that. If half of your mortgage is cheaper than that, ask him for the lower amount and point out that he's getting a discount.", "NTA\n\nWhat in the world. He wouldn\u2019t get \u201crent\u201d back either if it was an apartment. He absolutely should pay for his living costs in your home. It would be concerning to me that he is already balking at financial contributions to the household.", "He should be paying rent to stay in your home but idk why you\u2019re guys are phrasing it so weird like paying your mortgage. \n\nHe should be paying rent and you should be providing him with a lease. That means you\u2019re his landlord and he is your tenant.", "NAH. He doesn't need to contribute to your mortgage, but you're not wrong for asking for rent. Call it rent and he needs to pay. It will cover wifi and so on, but rent also covers the use of the house itself. Should he contribute to a mortgage he won't benefit from? No. But should he pay rent for the place he's living? Yes. Hope that makes sense!", "He shouldn't \"pay your mortgage\". He should *pay you rent*. Get a good rental agreement that complies with your local laws. Discuss if you will do a month-to-month agreement or a multi-month lease. He signs the agreement. This protects both of you.\n\nHe uses the house. No matter where he lives, he's paying the owner's mortgage. You're no different. NTA.\n\nAlternatively, he is free to try to find another living situation where he has that sort of space for $800.\n\n(I'd up it from $800 to either market rent in your area or at least enough so that when the water heater goes or you need to replace the washer and dryer, you have enough to do that. Since you're the landlord you are responsible for upkeep to the unit.)", "NTA. Why does he think he should he live ANYWHERE for free?   Tell him if he doesn\u2019t contribute, he needs to leave.", "You can either charge him rent (which you can use to pay towards to mortgage) but that means if anything needs doing to the house (new kitchen, new bathroom, permanent furniture, boiler needs fixing) that\u2019s on you to pay. \n\nOr you can ask him to pay towards the mortgage, put him on the mortgage deed, and then if anything needs doing to the house, it\u2019s a shared expense.", "NTA\n\n>He only wants to pay for the \u201cthings he uses\u201d such as water, trash, electric, & WiFi, but I am thinking\u2026 he also \u201cuses\u201d the house by living here\n\nHe does use the house, so he should pay to be there. \n\nSend him to live alone, so he can understand that these are all things that he uses and pays for. No free rides.", "NTA if he was to rent a house and the landlord decided to sell as soon as the morgage was paid off them the landlord wouldn't give him any of the money, he is looking for a free ride - kick his a$$ out", "NTA -  Guess I am not really sure what his angle is here.  Should just be a flat $800-$1000 (including bills that should be in your name) and call it a day. \n\n35-45% of mortgage/bills is more than fair considering you do own the home and will be building equity.  Would he split a major repair with you?  If the answer is no.. then he can pay normal rent.", "He should pay a reasonable rent", "NTA if you're not playing a team sport now, you most likely won't be playing a team sport after marriage. In his mind he should see it as paying rent and maybe things change when you're married. As of right now, he's free-loading. Everyone pays utilities to exist...he just doesn't want to pay that extra bit that takes adulting to achieve.", "NTA If you had a roommate would you charge them rent? Of course, you would. Your boyfriend is your tenant. If he doesn't have a lease it's a month to month tenancy. While this matter should have been resolved prior to your boyfriend moving in, if he doesn't want to pay rent to you, the landlord, he can move out and find somewhere else to live.\n\n>He only wants to pay for the \u201cthings he uses\u201d such as water, trash, electric, & WiFi, but I am thinking\u2026\n\nLike any landlord, you are responsible for the maintenance, repairs and any renovations of the home but no one is going to rent him a place for free where he only pays for utilities and trash pick up.", "NTA, just charge him rent.", "And, in addition to paying rent, you should have him sign a lease.  In the event, that you break up and he won\u2019t leave.  Then you have simpler means to evict him.", "NTA. He uses your home to live and sleep in. He has to pay to live somewhere, whether it be rent or a mortgage, so he should be paying you. \n\nThe question is whether a 50/50 split or 800 is fair, as he is correct, he gets no payout if you split, and he is paying off a chunk of your mortgage. I would say a 35% of the mortgage plus 50% of the bills is fair. You are solely responsible if anything breaks in or on the house. If he doesn't like it,  he can pay to live elsewhere.", "I mean if fair market value rent for him to share the same place with a roommate is 800 or more I don't see an issue. Rent needs paying too if you don't own a place.", "NTA. He should be paying rent WITH an actual legal lease agreement.", "NTA. Charge him rent. If he was renting elsewhere he\u2019d have to pay rent and he wouldn\u2019t get that back. Definitely have a legal contract written up tho. Or if it really bothers him, see if he\u2019ll purchase half of the property from you, matching and paying upfront what you\u2019ve already paid. then when it\u2019s equal ownership and split the remaining payments. It\u2019s perhaps more of a risk if you were to break up but if he\u2019s serious and that\u2019s the end of goal of the relationship. Why not?", "I'm sad you are willing to still marry this guy.this sounds like a disaster waiting to happen.", "Charge him market rate rent. And have a written lease. That way he is paying rent and not half the mortgage in his mind", "I see these posts frequently but mostly with reversed genders but he should be paying market rent all the same. The entitlement of some people.", "Nta, but half of the mortgage seems bit much depending on how much it is", "NTA. Is his expectation to live for free? If he wants to build equity instead of paying rent, he can either buy his own home or put a ring on your finger and make your home a marital asset. Otherwise, he can pay you for use of yours. Add up all fixed costs and divide by two. Don't call it mortgage, call it rent. \n\nI do get it, paying your girlfriend's house off for her feels weird, but end of the day everyone who rents instead of owning is paying for someone else to build equity off their rent. That's just how life is. If anything, maybe it's nice that his rent is building equity for someone he likes, and not Blackrock or some other faraway private equity goons who own the apartment he would otherwise be renting.", "Yta for not working this out before he moved in", "Nta. I find it funny people are willing to pay their landlord without a blink but oh no can\u2019t be helping my significant other out at all or help them get ahead", "Charge him $1000 per month for rent.  If he doesn\u2019t like it, I\u2019m sure he can find his own place for cheaper.  The extra 200 is an asshole tax on him.", "NTA. She would pay to live anywhere. He should definitely pay you rent.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

If you two split and he moves out, no issues. If you marry and share your economy the money he pays gets pooled into the shared assets - no issues. Be aware that by making him pay rent, he gets rights so you cant just tell him to leave all of a sudden.", "He should be paying about the market rate for rent, half the utilities, and maybe more than half the groceries (I know I eat more than my wife, and its not close).", "ESH - this conversation is way too late. You should have made an agreement before he moved in.

Doesn\u2019t matter if the genders were flipped or the earned income. It\u2019s just financially risky and irresponsible. Whoever\u2019s name is on the mortgage should be making the payments. I think it\u2019s entirely reasonable to ask him to contribute to water, electric, internet, gas, trash pickup and those types of utilities. If y\u2019all got married then I think it\u2019s appropriate to then at that point ask for help, because as of right now he has no vested interest to pay on the mortgage, he is not building any equity in the property.", "YTA, only because what he should be doing is paying you RENT. Not your mortgage. You need to legally understand the difference. You need to have a rental agreement so he can't lay claim to your property later.", "Or, tell him if he thinks this arrangement is fair, he should buy a house and let you live there for free.

You aren't married, the relationship may or may not go the distance. Charge him a reasonable rent. He is using the house, he will cause wear and tear.
