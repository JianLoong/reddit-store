It always stung a little like why wouldn\u2019t he want 4 daughters?!? We are great! and it still drives him mad and he used to slam that one right down and make the person feel really stupid for saying something stupid - which made me feel better and confident. He is a proud girl dad and used to always finish by telling people how he must have been a saint in a past life to have been blessed with all girls.\nYou did the right thing and your boys deserve to know that they\u2019re wanted and not a consolation prize!", "NTA, that was weird and presumptuous of her. It feels like she's relying on a gendered stereotype that says that girls are easier kids to care for because they'll take on some of your household labor or work around your needs, where as boys can do whatever they want and there's no solution for it. Whereas the reality is that kids of all ages can learn to take on chores and help their parents, AND children of all ages should be allowed to have a childhood and be boisterous.

Maybe it will make this woman more cautious next time she opens her mouth, and maybe not.  \n\nAs for your sister-in-law, I definitely wouldn't get angry with someone who told me my son was \"going to be feminine\", because that would make it sound as if feminine was a bad thing.

It could very well be justified, I don't know your past experience, but there's no reason to snap at people who aren't being malicious and are just making conversation. \n\nCommenting on a family being all boys/all girls/etc is pretty common small talk. This woman very likely wasn't actually pitying you or feeling sorry for you, just finding common ground in that you're both the only women in a household of men/boys. Further,  for most people it's not a choice (and especially if it was just you at the park she had no reason to just assume your boys were adopted) and just a comment on how the odds worked out. \n\nI won't touch on what your SIL said because those comments actually \\*are\\* problematic. But in this situation here, there was no need to escalate things or make them hostile.", "I think she meant \u201cpoor thing\u201d as in 4 boys is too much work for a parent.

Literally no reason to be rude here at all.", "ESH or NAH, eye of the beholder. What she said wasn't ideal, and you didn't handle it perfectly. Not a big deal though.", "YTA\n\nYour SIL is right, it's a normal thing people say and mostly they mean it as a compliment, as in \"I'm impressed you can manage having 4 boys, I barely can handle 2\". Also she told you she wanted a girl but her husband said no, so she is sad about her wish never coming true. As an answer you invalidate her feelings for no reason and also tell her that you could have had (several) girls but did not want to. Rude and self-centred.", "You need to take a chill pill and stop taking things so literally.", "ESH.\n\nShe might have been going for camaraderie (like SIL points out, it's a thing), but like too many aduls, she didn't consider that the kids who were listening to her talk about them are people too, with feelings too, and how her words might be hurtful to them.\n\nBut she hit a sore spot for *you*, so you lost your cool and the opportunity to answer in a way that supported your kids' feelings (nope, we love our boys and wouldn't change a thing) in favor of an answer that's also casually callous and potentially hurtful (we didn't care what we got, don't poor thing me).\n\nBoth adults put their feet in their mouth in front of these kids.", "Meh.

No need to be needlessly insulting. \n\nThis is all we have to go on of what was said, and it's been paraphrased: \n\n>\"Oh, you poor thing. I wanted a girl too but he (pointing to her husband) didn't want to have a 3rd.\"\n\nThe other person didn't seem to even mention trying for a girl, that's just in OP's description. All they seem to have said was along the lines of \"Oooof 4 boys, that's a lot! I've got two boys. I also wanted a girl, but my husband didn't want to have a third kid.\"\n\nFrankly, I don't see any issue with a couple \"trying\" for another gender, assuming they have the financial and emotional capacity to care for all their children adequately.", "i don't see a chip on your shoulder at all and I think this is not common talk. People can ask how many boys and girls you have, but not imply that you are missing out on what they ASSume you want when they don't know you. It is crossing the boundary between bonding as mothers and being presumptuous.\n\nNTA but the woman is.", ">It is very obvious looking at our family that they are adopted.\r\r\n\nIs it? I saw in a previous comment you say you're white and some of your boys are not. But who's to say your partner is also white, if he wasn't there? Who's to say they aren't from a previous marriage? Adoption isn't the only possible reason for your boys having a different skin tone than yourself. \n\nWith \"poor thing,\" obviously I wasn't there to hear the exact tone and context, but I'd still say you're overthinking her intentions and motives for saying it. That still falls in line with what I (and I think many others) would consider good-natured joking, i.e. \"Poor thing, the only woman in the house with a husband and four boys, I'm surprised you have any peace!\"\n\nIt's great that you are protective of your boys and wanting to make sure they feel assured in your love for them and their place in your family. Frankly, it's far better to be a slight A H to a stranger than to alienate your kids or make them think they aren't wanted. But you also could have just replied with something affirming to them like \"Oh they're a handful, but I couldn't imagine life without them\" without snapping at a stranger and calling out a perceived slight that very likely wasn't meant to be malicious or condescending in any way.", "And that\u2019s a totally valid answer but you said you had no strong desire for a girl, not you were open to  whatever happened along your way", "As a girl who loves football and hockey, never misses a game on tv and went to my first NFL game with my dad last year (Go Pack!), that \u201cpoor dad can\u2019t watch football\u201d comment really pisses me off.\n\nYou want your kids to watch sports with you, start teaching them the games when they\u2019re young, no matter what gender they are. It\u2019s magic how\nmost of them will want to keep on watching as they grow up. \ud83d\ude44", "Thanks. I love having 4 sons.", "It\u2019s not sexist it\u2019s just true. Men were expected to work/provide and women were expected to take care of the kids back then. Obviously there were exceptions but that\u2019s just the way it was. It\u2019s not a dig at him to say \u201cidk how much he helped when they were infants\u201d. It\u2019s just facts. Paternity leave wasn\u2019t really given, so how could he put a ton of work into raising the twins when they were infants. Even if he wanted to.", "I just found out I\u2019m pregnant and idc whether I have a boy or girl personally but it\u2019d be a bit easier because my 6yo daughter wants a sister. She has a brother and a soon to be step brother. I\u2019ll be happy no matter what but my daughter not so much \ud83d\ude05", "I agree that it is not their business and I normally ignore the questions but I mentioned it to show her that even though I did have a choice I still didn't choose a girl so I obviously was never super tied to having a daughter.", "Just say, \"That's what the hospital gave me and I assumed they knew what they were doing.\"", "And I already mentioned why talking about their adoption is relevant to this particular situation so okay.\n\nHer kids ARE her kids she is not singling them out by talking about their adoption when it is relevant to the context. I\u2019d think this other woman had more interesting stuff to talk about than her children\u2019s genders but here we are.", "DW op. It\u2019s a complicated topic and those in the know see what you\u2019re saying. Adoption/donor gametes or embryos shouldn\u2019t be stigmatised or a secret..plenty of evidence of how poorly that goes. Also defo NTA, she just got called out for being gross, let her sit with herself for a while.", "Yes, but pointing out a difference among the four children that is that significant can result in a child feeling that it is somehow defining; it\u2019s not a secret, but likewise, why emphasize it? Depending on the child, it could be a sensitive topic.", "We\u2019ll have to to agree to disagree on that. I don\u2019t find the other woman\u2019s comment benign at all. Further, to make so flip a comment about it being her husband\u2019s fault that they didn\u2019t have a daughter because he \u201cdidn\u2019t want a third\u201d just smacks of fertility privilege. OP was left infertile, and thereafter she chose to adopt boys. Sadly, too many women make comments like that if they\u2019re pretty much able to just go off birth control and conceive. And if you want children but can\u2019t have them, hearing someone talk about it like that is pretty hurtful, so I\u2019m guessing that that\u2019s part of OP\u2019s reaction, as well. I stand by my comment.", "Starting with \"you poor thing\"... really, nothing? And why would you use the words \"keep trying\" when talking about human beings? Are the ones you have not enough, not desired? Did you only have them because you couldn't abort them? When you make the choice of being a parent, you accept who your kid is, their sex, personality, etc, if you are not ready to do that, you are not ready nor deserving of being a parent.", "I did though. From my post,\n\n> I told her that I didn't try for a girl and that if I wanted a girl we could have put that in our adoption paperwork but we didn't have a gender preference.", "My dad has four sons. My sister is the only one who really likes watching sports.", "You are an amazing parent!!  I have friends who have three girls or three boys and they always get the question of whether #3 was because they were trying for another gender.  My favorite answer was \n\n\u201cWe wanted to have three children because we wanted three children.  We have exactly the children we hoped for because we couldn\u2019t imagine our family differently.  We aren\u2019t hung up on gender, we just spend our lives loving and enjoying these wonderful little people as they learn and grow.\u201d", "When my mother was pregnant with my youngest brother, my brother and I were literally fighting about the gender of the baby because I wanted a sister and he wanted a brother. My mother decided to find out the gender (that she initially wanted to be a surprise) just so she could prepare us to avoid drama. I was in tears when she told us it was going to be a boy.\n\nThe moment he was born, it didn't matter anymore. He was just my perfect little sibling that I love to pieces and would die to protect. The only thing I cared about was that I got to hold him. He's 14 now and I can't imagine a better sibling.\n\nI believe your daughter will be happy no matter what. It's great to be a big sister.", "great reinforcement telling your boys you chose them and love them", "Is it too out of the question to joke with nosy people and tell them \u201cthose kids? Nah, they\u2019re not adopted.\u201d    \n\nAnd just leave it there. Confuse them and walk away lol", "On the not wanting a third, I would take that to relate more to one's capacity to raise, provide, and care for a third child than anything related to their privilege of fertility. \n\nFrankly, I think there's too little context and detail provided for anyone to know exactly how something was phrased, intended, etc. All we know is a paraphrased version of a snippet of conversation between OP and someone else that may or may not include false perception or bias. In the very least, I don't think there's a strong case for this being anything more than a potentially poorly worded comment from someone who had the best of intentions. \n\nThe thing that matters most here is that OP's children feel supported and loved as they should be, and I'm glad to hear that OP is very conscious of that importance. I think this was a harsher reaction than necessary, but as I said in another comment, better to be a mild A H to a stranger than leave your kids question how you feel about them.", "Nope, nothing. Especially when said by someone in similar circumstances, I take that as more an attempt at solidarity than anything else. And to be clear, this was part of a larger conversation, not the very start of one. \n\nLol I'd forgotten how much I love reddit\n\nIf you read my comment above, you'll note that I specifically preface that there's no issue *assuming* they have the capacity to be good parents to all their children. I said nothing of the sort on aborting them, not wanting them, not accepting them, etc\n\nWanting to experience one thing doesn't diminish your value of something else automatically. If would-be parents want 2-4 kids and they decide to stop at two because they had a boy and a girl, great. If they have three boys they love and decide to have a fourth kid, great. If they have 4 and decide they have the capacity and resources for a 5th, great.", "And I quote, \u201cI had no strong desire for a girl\u2026\u201d. Jesus. You\u2019re NTA in the above situation but seeing how you react to anyone pointing out something you don\u2019t see, I\u2019m sure you\u2019re TA a good bit of the time. Enjoy being a boy mom", "She was a menace to her brothers belongings when her dad brought her brother home so while I really hope you\u2019re right I don\u2019t think she\u2019ll be very happy. Don\u2019t get me wrong she loves her brother but she\u2019s still very vocal about not being happy he\u2019s a boy. \n\nI\u2019ve had the talks that no one can pick what the baby will be so she knows it\u2019s not something that can be controlled. Her father and I aren\u2019t together tbc so her brother is less than a year and she may grow out of it.", "I did something like that once. I was out with all the boys and someone asked if they were all mine. I said, \"Yes but only two are biological\" and then I pointed to the two white bio boys and said that they were adopted. The woman was so confused.", "Yes! That\u2019s what I would do.", "I\u2019m talking about the other woman\u2019s assumption really that conceiving a girl would be as easy as her husband acquiescing to trying. For all she knew, she\u2019d end up with another boy, and then what? Try for #4 to see if she gets her girl? All I\u2019m saying is that a comment that implies that conception is as easy as deciding to try to someone who is infertile and chose to adopt whom she chose to adopt is an example of how too many people are tone deaf to others\u2019 struggles. But I agree that the important thing is that OP\u2019s boys feel supported and loved and she\u2019s clearly happy with the family she and her husband have created.", "Right. Because I had no strong desire for a girl. I feel like we are miscommunicating for some reason. I am very sorry if I upset you. I was trying to explain what I meant.", ">I\u2019m sure you\u2019re TA a good bit of the time.\n\n\n\nOp is an A H according to you (internet) stranger and the Real life stranger because Op did not have a strong desire for what they did not want. \n\n\nOp did not have a strong desire to be a girl mom and that is 100% fine.", "Omg this is priceless. I can only imagine her face.", "I'd look at them with wide eyes and go \"you can see them too?\"", "Bet the kids were cracking up though.", "Omg I just cackled.
