It always stung a little like why wouldn\u2019t he want 4 daughters?!?

He is a proud girl dad and used to always finish by telling people how he must have been a saint in a past life to have been blessed with all girls.\nYou did the right thing and your boys deserve to know that they\u2019re wanted and not a consolation prize!", "NTA, that was weird and presumptuous of her. It feels like she's relying on a gendered stereotype that says that girls are easier kids to care for because they'll take on some of your household labor or work around your needs, where as boys can do whatever they want and there's no solution for it. Whereas the reality is that kids of all ages can learn to take on chores and help their parents, AND children of all ages should be allowed to have a childhood and be boisterous.

This woman very likely wasn't actually pitying you or feeling sorry for you, just finding common ground in that you're both the only women in a household of men/boys. Further,  for most people it's not a choice (and especially if it was just you at the park she had no reason to just assume your boys were adopted) and just a comment on how the odds worked out. \n\nI won't touch on what your SIL said because those comments actually \\*are\\* problematic.

Not a big deal though.", "YTA\n\nYour SIL is right, it's a normal thing people say and mostly they mean it as a compliment, as in \"I'm impressed you can manage having 4 boys, I barely can handle 2\".
