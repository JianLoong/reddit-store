It was my girlfriend's birthday recently, and I wanted to surprise her with a gift that she would love.

Which was it, you wanted to surprise her with something she'd really love, or you wanted to give her a joke gift?", "ESH\n\nMildly, your GF. If I *really* want something and Christmas or my birthday is coming up, I'm very specific about what has my attention. Makes it easier for everyone to shop.\n\nYou, moreso. It's not very nice to give someone a joke as a gift, even if it's handmade, without a backup. So you're not at fault for not knowing exactly what she wanted and having the perfect gift on hand, but you should have had a real/traditional gift waiting in the wings.", "NTA. You put more time and effort into the present you gave her, and she barely hinted at you about what she really wanted. Does she expect you to read minds?", "She \u201cmentioned it in passing\u201d. ESH She for not communicating *clearly*, since you obviously don\u2019t pay attention. And *you* - for not *paying attention*!", "NAH honestly.\nOP it was nice of you to gift her a piece of art you created yourself. Now i assume you\u2019re a good artist and therefore had the right mind to make this humorous piece of artwork nice to look at.\n\nYour gf is also not entirely at fault here. Not many people are comfortable asking or demanding for things they may want. Especially as gift\u2019s because some people might call them difficult or be offended. I call bs on this.\n\nThe best way to gift someone something they\u2019ll like is to always gift them something they want or something they need. You can never go wrong. If it\u2019s for your partner then you should be able to note subtle signs or atleast keep note of the things that they are interested in. This can become difficult. Therefore you know what works best?\nAsking them what they want directly!!! \nI always do this and trust me i have never had to worry about a bad gift since then. You do not make them any less excited or any less appreciative. Infact they will always remember you for keeping their needs in mind and delivering on it. Even if you disagree with the item that they might have wanted. It is the most selfless way yo gift people and make them happy.", "Honestly gifts made and from the heart are worth far more than bought gifts.    Also maybe you should pay attention to little hints and make yourself notes.   I miss shit all the time, it's easier if I make a note to remember.", "This is a good time to be honest with each other. You need to know what is her limit or boundaries with respect of jokes bc some people is sensitive to it. \nI don't think the gift was bad if you put a lot of effort, but maybe she don't like the message of your gift, so instead of burying it and replacing it with the bunny, have a serious talk and learn from each other.", "I'm an artist. I do mostly Graphite portraits but I also paint. So I get wanting to gift your art. I do that as well. However, when it comes to my SO, if I'm gifting him art I will also still get him something meaningful or cute or whatever as a gift for his birthday.  I don't think y. T.  A. For choosing to gift art or not getting her a specific plushie. I'm gonna say soft yta bc you worded it that you gave the painting as a joke, meaning you knew she was probably looking forward to something sweet from you. Gift your art but when it come to SOs and birthdays, maybe also get them something.  My rule is something that's meaningful (doesn't have to be expensive) but that they wouldn't necessarily buy themselves.  A cute plushie, a little statue, something to show that this person is a big deal on that day and that you really thought about them. I would advise apology, maybe some flowers to go with the plushie and let her know your learning. Good luck OP and keep creating!", "YTA  \n\nand a Cheap asshole, at that", "YTA. When you get a joke/gag gift, you need to have a real gift as well.", "NTA. You\u2019re not required to be a mind reader. Although, if you consider a gift a joke, there should probably be a second more serious gift coming. \n\nGood idea to order the stuffed animal once she was actually clear about what she wanted, and if she is a reasonable person, this should be sufficient.\n\nEdit - An actual painting made just for her isn\u2019t totally \u201cjust a joke\u201d, so I don\u2019t consider it enough of a joke that it wasn\u2019t like getting her nothing at all. Might change my mind if I see it, but it sounds to me like you might be just used to denigrating your own artwork, so I don\u2019t consider this enough to make you wrong.", "Imma say NTA. As someone with a very forgetful BF, sometimes hints go right over peoples heads, and you need to be more direct, esp. if your love language is not gift giving", "I ll take a picture tomorrow and edit the post with it, it's actually pretty good", "Yup.  People are saying it's her fault because she wasn't explicit.  She was explicit.  She told him repeatedly how much she liked it.  Some people were taught that explictly asking for things, even for celebrations, is rude.  But she still told you what she wanted.", "And then! To ignore it and get her a \u201cjoke\u201d gift?", "To be fair she kinda read my mind when it was my birthday, she got me a rated 6 PSA Charizard that i really wanted for my collection. so i kinda feel bad now", "They're not if it's a joke made at her expense. Joke gifts are fine if it's not at the receiver's expense and if there is an actual gift to back it up."]}
