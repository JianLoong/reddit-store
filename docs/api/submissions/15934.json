Which was it, you wanted to surprise her with something she'd really love, or you wanted to give her a joke gift?", "ESH\n\nMildly, your GF. If I *really* want something and Christmas or my birthday is coming up, I'm very specific about what has my attention. Makes it easier for everyone to shop.\n\nYou, moreso. It's not very nice to give someone a joke as a gift, even if it's handmade, without a backup. So you're not at fault for not knowing exactly what she wanted and having the perfect gift on hand, but you should have had a real/traditional gift waiting in the wings.", "NTA. You put more time and effort into the present you gave her, and she barely hinted at you about what she really wanted. Does she expect you to read minds?", "She \u201cmentioned it in passing\u201d. ESH She for not communicating *clearly*, since you obviously don\u2019t pay attention. And *you* - for not *paying attention*!", "NAH honestly.\nOP it was nice of you to gift her a piece of art you created yourself. Now i assume you\u2019re a good artist and therefore had the right mind to make this humorous piece of artwork nice to look at.\n\nYour gf is also not entirely at fault here. Not many people are comfortable asking or demanding for things they may want. Especially as gift\u2019s because some people might call them difficult or be offended. I call bs on this.\n\nThe best way to gift someone something they\u2019ll like is to always gift them something they want or something they need. You can never go wrong. If it\u2019s for your partner then you should be able to note subtle signs or atleast keep note of the things that they are interested in. This can become difficult. Therefore you know what works best?\nAsking them what they want directly!!! \nI always do this and trust me i have never had to worry about a bad gift since then. You do not make them any less excited or any less appreciative. Infact they will always remember you for keeping their needs in mind and delivering on it. Even if you disagree with the item that they might have wanted. It is the most selfless way yo gift people and make them happy.", "Honestly gifts made and from the heart are worth far more than bought gifts.    Also maybe you should pay attention to little hints and make yourself notes.   I miss shit all the time, it's easier if I make a note to remember.", "This is a good time to be honest with each other. You need to know what is her limit or boundaries with respect of jokes bc some people is sensitive to it. \nI don't think the gift was bad if you put a lot of effort, but maybe she don't like the message of your gift, so instead of burying it and replacing it with the bunny, have a serious talk and learn from each other.", "I'm an artist. I do mostly Graphite portraits but I also paint. So I get wanting to gift your art. I do that as well. However, when it comes to my SO, if I'm gifting him art I will also still get him something meaningful or cute or whatever as a gift for his birthday.  I don't think y. T.  A. For choosing to gift art or not getting her a specific plushie. I'm gonna say soft yta bc you worded it that you gave the painting as a joke, meaning you knew she was probably looking forward to something sweet from you. Gift your art but when it come to SOs and birthdays, maybe also get them something.  My rule is something that's meaningful (doesn't have to be expensive) but that they wouldn't necessarily buy themselves.  A cute plushie, a little statue, something to show that this person is a big deal on that day and that you really thought about them. I would advise apology, maybe some flowers to go with the plushie and let her know your learning. Good luck OP and keep creating!", "YTA  \n\nand a Cheap asshole, at that", "YTA. When you get a joke/gag gift, you need to have a real gift as well.", "NTA. You\u2019re not required to be a mind reader. Although, if you consider a gift a joke, there should probably be a second more serious gift coming. \n\nGood idea to order the stuffed animal once she was actually clear about what she wanted, and if she is a reasonable person, this should be sufficient.\n\nEdit - An actual painting made just for her isn\u2019t totally \u201cjust a joke\u201d, so I don\u2019t consider it enough of a joke that it wasn\u2019t like getting her nothing at all. Might change my mind if I see it, but it sounds to me like you might be just used to denigrating your own artwork, so I don\u2019t consider this enough to make you wrong.", "Imma say NTA. As someone with a very forgetful BF, sometimes hints go right over peoples heads, and you need to be more direct, esp. if your love language is not gift giving", "I ll take a picture tomorrow and edit the post with it, it's actually pretty good", "Yup.  People are saying it's her fault because she wasn't explicit.  She was explicit.  She told him repeatedly how much she liked it.  Some people were taught that explictly asking for things, even for celebrations, is rude.  But she still told you what she wanted.", "And then! To ignore it and get her a \u201cjoke\u201d gift?", "To be fair she kinda read my mind when it was my birthday, she got me a rated 6 PSA Charizard that i really wanted for my collection. so i kinda feel bad now", "They're not if it's a joke made at her expense. Joke gifts are fine if it's not at the receiver's expense and if there is an actual gift to back it up.", "This is probably going to be unpopular,  but I'm going with ESH \n\nI will never understand why people think dropping hints or mentioning something in passing is the same as telling someone flat out.\n\nIf I want something from my husband or sons, I tell them straight out - I want this gift for this occasion. \n\nIf your girlfriend wanted that plush for her birthday,  she should have told you straight out.  Instead of \"mentioning it in passing.\"  So she sucks for playing coy and then getting upset with you for not getting her \"hints.\"\n\nYou suck for giving her a joke gift.", "yta........... but in a small way. it wasnt intentional and was simply lack of thought.. do better next year. and btw.remind your gf that apparently you dont know how to respond to hints, so she needs to be more forthright.", "Well Take it as a lesson for the Future.\n\nWhen my wife makes remarks about Things she Likes i Store the information right away in the Back of my brain.\n\nAllways awesome when you can surprise your better half with Something she mentiond months ago.\n\nIts those little Things in life which add to a good harmony in an relationship.", "YTA - it\u2019s her birthday. You don\u2019t get someone just a joke gift for their birthday or any other significant holiday. She probably felt like you were making fun of her love of Easter.\n\nI\u2019d bet that\u2019s what she\u2019s far more upset about than the bunny", "Damn, that is a really cute bunny.", "This is the best answer IMO. Handmade gifts can be lovely but there\u2019s a big difference between a beautiful painting and sketching a dumb picture in 30 minutes lol.", "How does mentioned in passing = explicitly said she wanted for her birthday???? You're projecting your own feelings on the post and ignoring what OP said completely. I mention stuff in passing to my bf that I like all the time, that doesn't mean I explicitly want that thing as a gift.", "Mentioned in passing, is not the same as saying she wants that specific item for her birthday.", "The best life tip I EVER saw on Reddit is when a loved one mentions something they need/like in passing write it in your phone notes. I have a master note now with friends/fam/neighbours names and things they've mentioned/pointed out, and when it's time to get a gift I just pull out my list and have so many options. I also come off as super thoughtful/having a good memory, but I tell everyone the trick. Too good not to share. Plus people don't think anything of you pulling your phone out for 20 seconds when you're out.", "But she mentioned it in passing \u201ca few times.\u201d", "That is still not the same as saying, \"I want you to get me this plush for my birthday.\"\n\nI mention things I want in passing to my husband all the time, I don't expect him to run out and buy it.  If there is something I truly want for my birthday, Mother's Day,  Christmas, or whatever I specifically tell him, I want this for this occasion.  Example,  recently for my birthday I wanted an Angel garden statue, there were I few I liked, I took pictures of them, sent them to my husband,  telling him I wanted one of them for my birthday. \n\nIf you want something from someone, don't drop hints, don't beat around the bush, just straight up tell them.  It saves time, confusion, headaches,  and arguments.", "Why would you make a joke about something that your girlfriend loves, like Easter? Making a joke about something that someone loves is a way of putting them down. \n\nWhen you do a birthday gift joke or prank, you're supposed to have another real gift for them.\n\nPresenting a \"joke\" gift is more about you than her, because once again you're supposed to get her a real gift to go with it.\n\nYTA", "This is some guerrilla marketing bullshit right here", "My husband did exactly this. Not only that, but twice I specifically told him not to get me a spa gift card. And he did. Twice.\nIt is hurtful. It basically means he doesn't care, and is lazy. \nSo now, I  buy my own gifts, it's been maybe 10 years since he got me any gifts.", "She wants thoughtfulness from you; you hearing her drop a hint and following through.", "NTA.\n\nIt does sound like you might have missed the hints here. But still NTA. \n\nWhy do people think they should control the gift that somebody else gives them? The gift giver always gets to decide the gift imo. If you want to ensure she likes it, ask her specifically next time. Better communication is the key.", "Gonna disagree and say NTA.  One thing I've always disliked is having people 'mention' things they would like to have multiple times.  I've had occasions where the giftee has done this and ended up with three or four of the same item because they mentioned it to several people.  Neither the givers nor the receiver seemed very pleased with the results.  \n\nPeople can't read minds - gf needed to plainly tell him she wanted that specific rabbit.", "Yta", "YTA", "NTA. I would be pissed if I took the time to create a personalized gift and then get told she wanted something else and I should've read her mind. \n\nAll these YTA's are ridiculous to me, I was taught to always at least pretend to be grateful for gifts.", "This feels like an ad.", "YTA for making a joke of her birthday", "A joke gift is cool if you back it with the real gift. Like  cheap claw game jewelry as the joke but soon after you give her the real necklace.", "YTA. \n\nI\u2019m big on gifts. I put a LOT of thought into the whole thing. \n\nYou didn\u2019t get her a gift - you got her a joke? If you painted her the picture because you love her and were inspired, then that\u2019s a totally different story.", "Did you put effort into the art?? I can\u2019t tell if you mean you made a mockery of her bday present or you made her gift.", "Did I miss something?  Is there 2 paintings? The painting and the joke.", "I get what you're saying but it's not realy fair to expect something just because you say you like it and want it. I like/want many things I see online or out in the world. I do not expect these as gifts, even if I show them to my bf. That just screams entitlement to me. If I got every charmed aroma or stupidly adorable bat plush or fancy mug i came across he would be broke and our house would be on an episode of hoarders"]}
