My bio mom set up the fund for me before she passed away and it was meant for my education.\n\nI love my family and they are important to me but I've been saving every penny and working part-time to contribute. My step-siblings have their own funds set up by their bio dad and I never expected to share mine.\n\nMy stepmom insists it's about being a \"blended family\" and treating everyone equally. I'm torn because I want to be fair and don't want to start dram  in my family but I feel like this fund is my lifeline for college.

My bio mom set up the fund for me before she passed away and it was meant for my education.\n\nI love my family and they are important to me but I've been saving every penny and working part-time to contribute. My step-siblings have their own funds set up by their bio dad and I never expected to share mine.\n\nMy stepmom insists it's about being a \"blended family\" and treating everyone equally. I'm torn because I want to be fair and don't want to start dram  in my family but I feel like this fund is my lifeline for college.

NTA", "My goodness what an AH your dad is.  He should not be asking you how you feel about this. He should have shut it down immediately.  Its a completely inappropriate request.  Its your inheritance from your mother and you should not be made to feel guilty in using it for your education.  \n\nI would have conversation with your maternal grandparents if they are around.

Also, you contributed yourself, and frankly should be able to use any unused part for your own place.", "Your mother put that aside for YOU, not anyone else.

They are alive to contribute to the stepsiblings funds in the same manner yours was for the next 2 and 4 more years, at x rates, and build them up.

The deserve nothing.", "I highly doubt the step mother is making her kids share anything", "NTA - and ditto.  It was not appropriate for your step mom to even approach the subject.  I can possibly see a point about \"blended\" with current income and expenses for a family, but even that is sketchy when taking the other bio-parents into the equation.", "It\u2019s not fair to you!\nPart of being a blended family is accepting that some things are going to be different.

You\u2019d be an absolute fool if you did.", "For the love of everything, please do NOT share any of it. College is extremely expensive and life after it is even more so. You're going to need every penny of it. Like using it as down payment for a house after you're done with college. Or if you need to do any unpaid internships, you'll have something to support you. Or for any emergencies. Your mom started this fund for you, it's not for your stepmom or step siblings. Honor your mom's memory. NTA Life is only going to get more expensive. Every penny will be necessary. Save it all for yourself. If you can, get that money away from your father's reach before your stepmom guilts him into taking the money. Open another account where he or stepmom won't have access. Money brings the worst out of people, your stepmom is being greedy as it is, she doesn't care about taking money from a kid who's mom gave her final gift to.

Just keep reminding him that YOU lost a parent and the money was meant for you. Steps two whole-ass adults who could've been contributing more but didn't. Not your circus, not your monkeys.", "I'd imagine there's a process for it though, and that it's better to have one for each kid instead of one for multiple.", "And it sounds like some of OP's money is her OWN savings. Stepsibs aren't working and saving their earnings, which makes asking OP to share that money even MORE ridiculous.", "I never said she should share.\n\nI'm implying that if the mother isn't asking the step-siblings to share their money, then she has no right to ask OP to share her money.", "Att least considering YOUR opinion?  It's your money, and yours is the only opinion that matters.  Your stepmom can kick rocks.", "If he\u2019s putting pressure on you, he\u2019s not neutral. I would point out that mom would want you to have her money and not his new family.   I also point out that your mom literally died his stepchildren have both of their parents. I would also ask him how many sacrifices you were expected to make when no one else is required to sacrifice. You\u2019ve already lost your mother, why would you lose the education she left for you? I would tell him that I would never forgive him if he stole my inheritance from my mother, so that his new kids could benefit from her death. But I am petty, and I would be willing to walk away at 18.

Also, the stepsiblings seem to have two living parents and the OP has one.", "Agreed, your bio mom didn\u2019t intend for that money to go towards two kids she doesn\u2019t know, she intended it for YOU!\n\nHopefully no fighting is involved and you can simply tell them no.", ">(AH)stepfather\n\nEither an (AH)step mother, or an (AH) father, (both of which sound like tremendous assholes) but there is no stepfather involved in this story.  \n\n(Well, I suppose her father is stepfather to her stepsiblings but the story is told from OPs perspective so your posting that threw me off)", "One thing I've noticed over the years is that sharing tends to be one sided.", "Definitely. And regardless of if it\u2019s possible/legal OP should stand her ground", "I would not open up this convo", "He's not pressuring me I don't think, just asking me what I want to do.", "Tell him no.
