My bio mom set up the fund for me before she passed away and it was meant for my education.\n\nI love my family and they are important to me but I've been saving every penny and working part-time to contribute. My step-siblings have their own funds set up by their bio dad and I never expected to share mine.\n\nMy stepmom insists it's about being a \"blended family\" and treating everyone equally. I'm torn because I want to be fair and don't want to start dram  in my family but I feel like this fund is my lifeline for college. AITA if I stand my ground and keep the money for myself?\n\nEDIT: Thank you for your kind responses, although I think a lot of people are assuming things about my stepmother and dad. She has been in my family for about 4 years now and has been almost like a second mom to me the whole time. (although obviously she won't ever replace my bio mom) I genuinely don't think that she has any malicious intent. I will be talking with her and my dad about it tomorrow to tell them I definitely don't want to share the fund.

My bio mom set up the fund for me before she passed away and it was meant for my education.\n\nI love my family and they are important to me but I've been saving every penny and working part-time to contribute.
