Over the years sister would dump her daughter to me, come by without any announcements or calls, put her in front of my door. ring the bell, run back into her car, then as I am opening the door, while the car is pulling out of my drive way, she shouts asking me to babysit the daughter. She has always guilt tripped me on this. My parents have always tried the whole \"be nice to your sister, help her out\". Since I am not dating anyone. Not like I can do that since sister dumps daughter on me all the time. She is a teenager now by the way.\n\nShe goes on how I have all the time in the world to babysit her daughter, my niece. I am not dating anyone, not that anyone would date a fat Mongolian cow. I could lose the weight babysitting the niece, I could take her shopping to the mall, that's exercise, walking, right? Obviously I am supposed to pay for the shopping. Yes I admit I am a bit chubby. I am about 10 pounds overweight, In the summer I will lose that.\n\nParents just take her side and say that I could lose a few pounds.\n\nYears ago I was stupid enough to get one of those family plans. My phone along with my parents phones and my sister. All under my name. I didn't charge anything to my parents. Sister barely pays anything she consumes. So after the last dinner we had together. I kicked my parents, sister and brother-in-law out of my house. It's always me doing the cooking, cleaning, shopping, etc... None of them live with me.\n\nThe morning after, I called my mobile company and cancelled the the three phone lines. Blocked their e-mails, phone numbers from contacting me.\n\nAITA for doing this?
