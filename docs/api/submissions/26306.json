There are many things you can do to make her a part of your wedding without putting her in the wedding party", "NTA. The wedding party is about who is most important to you. On the bride's side, it should be the people she's closest to - her own best friends.

I commend Skye for refusing the money.", "NTA\nDid no one teach your dad and step mom that money can't buy everything?\nAlso I can think of no instances where something should be considered both generous but with strings.

I was pretty hurt when I wasn\u2019t invited to be a bridesmaid in my brother\u2019s wedding as we were super close and he didn\u2019t have any grooms people where I could have joined in.

But I can understand how your step sister feels. You aren\u2019t obligated by any means though.", "NTA. They offered the bribe. You said no. End of story. The issue may be your parents wanting you and stepsister to appear close, when you are not. To create an illusion of a tight knit blended family. It doesn't sound like your step-sister is toxic. You just are not close. So what? My only attendant was my MOH (best friend). Not one of my bio-sisters. I didn't hear anything about it.", "NTA. You are friends with and have known your step brother for years. Skye isn't friends with your step sister and barely knows her. Wedding parties are for those closest to you. Step sister is just a guest.", "It is totally normal to not have siblings in the bridal party - or to have some siblings and not others.  My brother was my husband's groomsmen because they are good friends - but I never considered having any of his sisters in my bridal party and no one ever questioned it.  It's all about the relationship- especially to the person who's side you are standing up on.", "I can\u2019t imagine your parents are really thinking this through.

Bridal party is picked by the bride and no one else. Since she isn't friends with your fiance. But still I can't help but think something more is going on here. Did your dad marry his affair partner?

I do applaud you for keeping your wedding party small, and sticking to your point on this. Offering the money is a little odd.", "She's an adult. It's pathetic if she's actually going to them to make them force you to \"play\" with her. That's a learned behaviour. They've taught her that they'll pressure you for her. \n\nGrown ups talk to each when they feel upset. Maybe just highlight that from now on. Your stepsister is an adult, if she has a problem she should talk to you instead of behaving like a child. Say you'd have more respect for her if she did that.

That she is not the centre of everybody's life.  That sometimes, she just isn't the most important person in the room.\n\nYou and your bride-to-be have chosen your attendants.  Nobody is entitled to alter your arrangements.  If stepsis were a four-year-old there might be a case for her not knowing any better, but at 24 she should shut up, buy a great new outfit, and smile at your wedding.  \n\nIf your parents consider that any thwarting of stepsis' wishes can be dealt with by throwing money at it, she is in for a very confusing future.\n\nNTA", "NTA. How would your stepsister fee if she knew her parents had to pay $3000 for her to be included? \n\nThat would probably be so embarrassing for her and I doubt she is the one asking for it. She\u2019s probably perfectly happy being a guest.", "NTA. It's normal to have people are you really close to as bridesmaids and groomsmen. Does your stepsister even know about this or even want this? Parents tend to overestimate step siblings relationships.\n\nAlso, as a kid I was (geniune) friends with this one girl. Some other 'friends' of hers told her at one point that they were only being friends because their parents said they had to. She was devastated. I can only imagine how your stepsister would feel if she found out not only was she a bridesmaid because your parents insisterd but because they paid $3000.", "What a ridiculous ask. There is no conceivable reason for your fiance to make some girl she barely knows HER bridesmaid. $3,000 or not.\n\nAnd from the stepsisters standpoint, how embarrassing would it be to know that you're a bridesmaid only because your parents BRIBED to make it happen? That is so cringeworthy it's scary.\n\nNTA.", "Can I just ask how old your stepsister is now?", "NTA\n\nI feel like given the lack of relationship with stepsister and her history of manipulating situations to get what she wants you may want to have some sort of security at your wedding. Since bribing her way into the wedding party hasn't worked she could very well cause a scene either during the ceremony or reception.  \n\nIf she remains an invited guest I would be cautious of her behavior.  I would also be cautious of stepmother and even your father's behavior during your wedding. Clearly stepsister is the favored child and Reddit has seen a lot of disastrous scenes caused by favored children not getting their way.\n\nCongratulations on your future marriage and good luck on your wedding day.", "NTA tell them if seeing the others be on the wedding party is going to be so distressing for stepsister you are happy to uninvite her and if stepmother continues to push she\u2019s welcome to not attend too.", "NTA. It\u2019s completely normal not to have siblings in wedding parties. Kai is not in the wedding party as a gesture but because he\u2019s one of your closest friends, so it makes sense for him to stand on your side. He is, of course, made closer to you by being your future BIL, but none of this makes it so that there is an inequality with your family.", "NTA - Bridal party should be who the bride and groom want to stand next to them on the their big day. Honestly, I would be more inclined to say you were an asshole for taking the money and being able to be bribed. lol", "NTA. \n\nThey tried to bribe a bride and groom.\n\nDo their want your stepsister to be a bridesmaid or a BRIBESMAID?", "NTA.

The stepsister probably doesn\u2019t even care to be a bridesmaid it\u2019s just something the parents want for appearances. You could always offer to have the stepsister do a reading or some other task during the day", "NTA. Definitely NTA\n\nWhat is it with weddings and people thinking they have any say as to how you celebrate your day. You stick to your guns. If it's going to be a massive issue for your stepmother, then tell her they don't have to go. Dont uninvite her, but just make her aware that your special day does not in anyway revolve around her or your stepsister and it will not stop you both from getting married with your favorite people standing by. \n\nMy sister ruined my wedding with all her drama lama attitude, so this type of post really rubs me the wrong way. If I could give anyone thinking of getting married any advice, just elope with your SO and your besties and to hell with everyone else. There will always be someone who is pissed over something. At the end of the day it's you and your SO that you should be keeping happy and to hell with anyone who thinks otherwise", "NTA. But for an easy life, I'd allow it if I was you", "NTA - I feel like it'd be worse if you accepted. If stepsister found out the only reason she was a bridemaid was because her mother paid you to include her, it would end up damaging more than one relationship.", "Edit for adding judgement! : NTA \n\nBuying a bridesmaid position?  Absurd.\n\nYou chose who is appropriate. The situation with your fianc\u00e9's brother is completely different from the situation with your step-sister.

That humiliation would be so much worse for her", "NTA. Bribery is usually a bad sign, which your parents should know that. You\u2019re not close; it happens! If you like each other fine and Skye really is disappointed and you really feel bad about it, then if I were you, I\u2019d ask Skye to do something else that\u2019s pretty small and note both her and her contribution during a speech. Ex. Help with designing the programs, or making one of the DJ announcements (introducing you for the first dance or telling people it\u2019s time to cut the cake or toss the bouquet etc). Then during the speech you get to point her out to everyone and thank her and say how much you appreciated getting to spend a little more time with her during the wedding prep process.", "NTA but how much are the willing to spend? I mean 5,000 plus all the supplies for the extra bridesmaid and groomsmen because you can\u2019t have an uneven number. See if you can also get them to throw in the cost of the cake. I would milk this for everything it was worth and my step sisters would help me and not even be mad about it.", "NTA, and if your dad keeps it up I suggest you make him carpark attendant", "NTA. They want to buy a place in your wedding party? That's pathetic and your Dad and his wife are being crazy. This is your wedding and you don't have to make any compromises in order to sooth the entitled feelings of others. I wonder if your step sister even cares about this, because it sounds more like her mother wants this, not your stepsister.

You don't even know if SS actually wants this, or it's just your SM pushing this.\n\nYour parents are all caught up in their notion that the WEDDING must show the FAMILY at it's ideal best.

The situations are not the same.", "Well, when money fails, bring out guilt I guess.\n\nYour reasoning is sound. I am pretty sure stepsister won't be upset, this is step-mother's feelings about the matter. Also, you each only have 2 attendants.

OP was right to turn it down. (I wonder what else, if anything, his dad and stepmom are contributing to the wedding).", "Step sis needs to stop using the same tactics she did as a child. If they bring it up again mention explicitly how she has only met your fiancee twice, and how weird it would be to have a virtual stranger to your bride standing up for her. Step sis is going to feel left out even if you did let your step mom bribe you into letting her join the party, because she won't know any of the other people well. Wedding prep is not the time to get to know anybody, and it would be stressful for both your step sis and your fiancee.", "If she does get an official role she'll make a fuss about not feeling wanted or not getting the dress she wants or some other baloney.

The fact one of your closest friends is your bride's brother is irrelevant, that's not why you included him. \n\nYou're not close to your stepsister, and more than that, she's practically a stranger to the bride. Why would a bride choose a stranger as a bridesmaid, regardless of relation to her groom?\n\nYes, maybe the money would have come in handy, weddings are expensive, but it's just a bribe to make the stepsister feel special. It completely ignores what you and your partner want for your wedding, which is to be surrounded by those closest to you. \n\nStand your ground.

Money makes it transactional, and so you'll be comparing the payment and the value of being a bridesmaid.", "NTA. How entitled do you have to be to choose a bridesmaid FOR THE BRIDE?

Her in-laws did the planning of the wedding from the get-go. What got to her stepmom was that her two step Brothers that were of ages that were too old for some rolls in the wedding party and two young for others had no place in the wedding party at all. But she already had her baby girls as flower girls and her youngest son as the ring bearer in the party and then at last minute my son the brother of the Bride got to be and usher which really floored stepmom. All of these arrangements were up to the bride and groom and in some parts of the wedding plans up to his parents since they cover the cost of everything. But her stepmom had a fit in Hera about it because all of her kids weren't in the wedding and made it all about her.
