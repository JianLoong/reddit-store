The wedding party is who the bride and groom feel most deserve the honor and who they want standing with them. It was honestly nice of the bride to leave the decision up to you as it\u2019s HER bridal attendants the stepsister would be part of. The decision has been made and, honestly, does your stepmother think her daughter would feel better knowing the only reason she\u2019s in the wedding is because you were bribed into including her?", "NTA.  You both choose special people and have a balanced party.  Absolutely zero need to interfere with that for someone who doesn't have a real relationship.  Also, it sounds like if that $3k was accepted stepmother would then think she was running the wedding.  Remind them that stepsister doesn't need to come if it will be too hard on her.  It's not like being in the wedding is a day of game decision.", "NTA!\n\nI can't believe they actually offered you a bribe to include your stepsister lol.\n\nThis is so wrong in so many levels...\n\nbridesmaids should be the closest friends of the bride - not a total stranger that tries to buy her place and would get \"upset\" because she's an entitled brat.", "NTA. No amount of money changes the fact that it's your special day, your parents should respect that.", "NTA. They're literally trying to buy your stepsisters happiness and they're trying to bribe you. The fact that they don't see how unreasonable and outlandish what they're doing is tells me everything I need to know about your relationships with them and their relationship with the world.\n\nIf you were even slightly close it would feel like a snub. But you aren't and it's unreasonable to expect you'd be part of a wedding just because your mom was married to the groom's dad. It's telling that you gave names to Nick and Kai and Skye, but not to any of your \"family\".", "Nta. It seems like your dad and stepmom wants to show off how happy the blended family is. Yeah I'm not getting good vibes from this. I don't like what they are trying to pull. Did your stepsis even ask to be part of the wedding?", "Nta! I have 3 older brothers and never been in their weddings and they weren't in mine. She should have never expected it. Just because they're a relative doesn't give the automatic rights to be in weddings.  Perhaps she's got no close friends and thought you'd be her last chance to be in a wedding, hence why she's so upset.", "NTA. It's you and your future wife's wedding, which means you're the only ones with a say in the wedding party. If you don't want your stepsister in the wedding, your decision should be respected.", "Yikes. Definitely NTA. Talk about buying affection! Geez. Weddings are an intimate celebration of love and loved ones. Not \"buy your way into bridal party/invite our friends\" etc.", "NTA", " So NTA.

Or is this how  your dad and her mother feel?\n\nI wasn't in my sister's  wedding.  Didn't bother me at all. We get along just fine, but she chose her two best friends", "NTA. If they continue to press the point, remind them that offering bribes isn't a good look.", "NTA. I just don\u2019t understand why people other than the bride and groom feel entitled to making wedding decisions. They\u2019re being ridiculous.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Maybe she could read or do something else", "NTA that 3k is insulting to you and your step sister.", "NTA - Your wedding, your decision, end of discussion.", "NTA. You can't buy a relationship and the fact that your stepmother is trying to is pretty telling as to why you're probably not close to your stepsister now.", "NTA \u2014 you and your fianc\u00e9 don\u2019t have a strong connection and are keeping it small. Trying to bribe you is tacky on your parents part. I just don\u2019t see why she feels the need to have that attention.\n\nYou could ask her to do a reading? It\u2019s a soft compromise to keep the peace.", "NTA. I'm glad you didn't accept their bribe. Imagine having such low integrity that you'd buy your daughter a place at a wedding.", "Stick to your decision. Maybe you could ask her to say a reading or poem during the ceremony to make your parents happy?  could you imagine how that girl would feel when she found out her mother paid you to be part of your wedding party? There are many things you can do to make her a part of your wedding without putting her in the wedding party", "NTA. The wedding party is about who is most important to you. On the bride's side, it should be the people she's closest to - her own best friends. She doesn't even know this woman. \n\nIt's bizarre that anybody would be upset by not being a strangers bridesmaid. I suspect it's more the parents projecting their own issues rather than any feeling on her part.", "NTA.  Skye chooses her bridesmaids.  Your step-mother\u2019s money has no value there.  I commend Skye for refusing the money.", "NTA\nDid no one teach your dad and step mom that money can't buy everything?\nAlso I can think of no instances where something should be considered both generous but with strings. If it's conditional it's a transaction, not a generosity.", "They want to buy relationship using money. Respect for keeping your integrity. NTA. I would have done the same as you.", "Are you having ushers for the wedding?  That may be a compromise as that can be rather an extension of \"bridesmaid/groomsmen\" positions.\n\nSeriously, though, NTA.", "NTA. I think your dad and his wife both need to look up the words 'compromise' and 'bribe'.", "I presume she's a guest? Why should you feel obligated to make her a bridesmaid?\n\nAnd offering a bribe, man that's crass.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I wonder how hurt she'll be when she finds out they tried to buy her way into the wedding party.", "\"they know she feels hurt\" Has she actually said this or are they making an assumption? Could this be more to do with them wanting to show everyone a false picture of what their family is like? As in they think people will be wondering why your \"sister\" isn't in the party when Skye's brother is?\n\nNot that it's relevant to your decision. You're NTA and have perfectly good reasons not to have her. You wouldn't be an ass even if you didn't have any particular reason.\n\nI just ask because the choice of words is curious and it makes me wonder if she actually cares about this at all.", "NTA.  How is that a compromise?\n\nYour dad and stepmom are sketchy here.", "NTA do they not think she\u2019d be hurt only being included as bridesmaid because of a cash bribe? Many full siblings aren\u2019t included in wedding parties and attend as guests. Will you include stepsister in any of the family photos?", "NTA. I was pretty hurt when I wasn\u2019t invited to be a bridesmaid in my brother\u2019s wedding as we were super close and he didn\u2019t have any grooms people where I could have joined in. I did get asked to do a reading, which I enjoyed. Could that be a compromise? It\u2019s understandable that your fianc\u00e9e wouldn\u2019t want someone she hardly knows in her bridal party. But I can understand how your step sister feels. You aren\u2019t obligated by any means though.", "NTA. They offered the bribe. You said no. End of story. The issue may be your parents wanting you and stepsister to appear close, when you are not. To create an illusion of a tight knit blended family. It doesn't sound like your step-sister is toxic. You just are not close. So what? My only attendant was my MOH (best friend). Not one of my bio-sisters. I didn't hear anything about it.", "NTA. You are friends with and have known your step brother for years. Skye isn't friends with your step sister and barely knows her. Wedding parties are for those closest to you. Step sister is just a guest.", "It is totally normal to not have siblings in the bridal party - or to have some siblings and not others.  My brother was my husband's groomsmen because they are good friends - but I never considered having any of his sisters in my bridal party and no one ever questioned it.  It's all about the relationship- especially to the person who's side you are standing up on.", "I can\u2019t imagine your parents are really thinking this through. I would be devastated to learn I was made a bridesmaid because my parents paid the couple getting married to include me! How can they not see how that\u2019s so much worse than being a regular guest!? NTA", "This, and the fact that the parents seem able to financially contribute to the wedding but are only willing to do so to force the stepsister into the party.", "Thank you for bringing up the word bribe. It\u2019s not a compromise, how his parents keep saying. There is no compromise to be made. It\u2019s a bribe.", "She never asked me but I 100% believe she would say all this to them because that's how it used to go when she wanted something and didn't think I'd want to.", "I do believe she feels the way they have described.", "They feel like she should be included because she wants to be and her feelings should be prioritized. I'm okay with not offering a compromise to keep the peace. Not that it would keep the peace. Nothing short of her getting an official role would.", "I believe she has said this to them. That's normally how things play out. She tells them and they try to get me to do something where she feels like we're brother and sister.", "Yeah. Still nta. Bridal party is picked by the bride and no one else. Since she isn't friends with your fiance. But still I can't help but think something more is going on here. Did your dad marry his affair partner? What is the story here. Is your mom dead? Or what needmore info please.", "Still NTA", "Wow- yeah, I see your point and it really isn\u2019t worth it. I do applaud you for keeping your wedding party small, and sticking to your point on this. Offering the money is a little odd.", "She's an adult. It's pathetic if she's actually going to them to make them force you to \"play\" with her. That's a learned behaviour. They've taught her that they'll pressure you for her. \n\nGrown ups talk to each when they feel upset. Maybe just highlight that from now on. Your stepsister is an adult, if she has a problem she should talk to you instead of behaving like a child. Say you'd have more respect for her if she did that. It could make the three of them hesitant to badger and manipulate you this way.", "My parents divorced. I lived primarily with mom and saw dad one weekend a month. Wasn't close to my dad prior to his second marriage or afterward. My mom died when I was 12 and I had to move in with them then. But I moved out as soon as I was 18."]}
