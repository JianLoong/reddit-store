She did not bother to pay her rent for 4/5 months and I got people coming over asking for money. It also affected my credit score and is still not perfect to this day.

You\u2019re not cheap or selfish; you\u2019re being responsible. Your wife\u2019s demand is unreasonable. This is a huge ask.\n\nI guess if it was just a question of getting into/qualifying for a place and the relatives were willing to give me the full amount to pay for a one year lease in advance while they established/repaired their credit, I might consider it if I trusted them enough to not trash the place and my spouse enough to not give them the money back behind my back.

That way, when something happens and they stop paying (as it will), you only take the financial loss, and your credit score is unaffected. If you leave them to handle the rent, *your* credit score will be pooched before you even hear there's a problem.", "NTA - Never co-sign on anything for anyone, ever, ever, ever.  Especially family members.  Absolutely no good can from this.  There usually a very good reason their credit is so bad, they are deadbeats.  Probably why they lost the other house, your other relative couldn't get them pay on time and had to sell the house to get them out.  Think about it, who do you think slammed their credit in renting anyway.", "NTA. Do not mess up you're credit score if they have a bad history. Seriously it will make your life much harder.", "NTA. You are wise. Never tie your credit history to anybody unless you trust them.", "Why isnt your wife on the lease for her parents Then?", "NTA Your money is your money. I bet that if YOU were in financial trouble they wouldn't give a flying fuck.", "NTA. Do not do this.", "NTA - why would you sign for your wife's family.  Why doesn't she sign?\n\nThis would be a huge mistake on your part if you did sign.  Obviously your SIL with a full-time job, pays no rent but has bad credit is an issue.  This is a big big red flag\n\nYou would be left liable if something were to go wrong, damages, non-payment of rent and your credit would be wiped out. \n\nTell your wife if she wants to co-sign go ahead, if she's a SAHW tell her to get a job and sign, but you are not getting involved in that mess.\n\nBig thing to consider, if the people you are applying for a house for runs a credit check they will see you don't live in the country and you are an even bigger risk.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
