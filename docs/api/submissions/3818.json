{"id": 3818, "submission_id": "zb3lux", "title": "AITA for baking one cookie per person?", "selftext": "This is beyond trivial but I'd like to know what other people think, especially parents.\n\nLast weekend, my nephew Tate (5) started coming over for piano lessons with my husband. My SIL and brother brought him, along with my niece (3). I had a few cookies left over from a batch I'd made the day before, and I told Tate that if he listened to my husband during the lesson, there'd be a cookie waiting for him after.\n\nEveryone hung out in another room for about 20 minutes while my husband and Tate did the lesson. Afterward, I gave him and my niece a cookie. He asked for another one, and then a third, finishing them off. His parents were cool with it and mentioned his appetite's been large lately.\n\nI saw Tate a few days later (we get together for dinner every week with my parents) and he seemed to think he will always get a cookie after his lesson, as a matter of fact, which I thought was pretty cute and don't mind obliging.\n\nThis week, I made and froze a few dozen different types of cookie dough balls for Christmas. So when Tate came over today for lesson #2 with his mom, dad, and sister in tow, I popped six cookies in the oven: one for every person. After the lesson, I put the cookies out and everyone took one, including me. \n\nThe problem began when Tate finished his cookie and asked for another one. I told him I only made one for everyone. Soon after that, I mentioned to my SIL all the cookie dough I'd been making lately. She asked if I had more ready to bake, why didn't I bake more than six, since I knew Tate would want more than one?\n\nI didn't really have a good answer. I said I didn't want to use up all the cookies that were intended for Christmas, which was part of it, but it sounded kind of lame on its own. The truth was it did occur to me to bake more, but I thought one celebratory cookie after a music lesson seems... appropriate. Like a healthy, structured ritual. Whereas having three or more cookies seems like it's crossing the line into anarchy (I am kidding of course, just having a hard time conveying my feeling on this).\n\nEven though I didn't say any of this, I think it came across, because my SIL and brother seemed tense and left pretty quickly. Now I feel like maybe I was imposing my own morals on them, which may not have been cool.  They're not my kids. I don't even have kids.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA? Should I double up on cookies next week?", "created_utc": 1670029602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb3lux/aita_for_baking_one_cookie_per_person/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Not an AH at all in my book", "NTA. You\u2019re a good aunt. It\u2019s a fun little tradition also. SIL can count, she could have deferred her cookie if she was so worried for Tate to have 2.", "NTA. \n\nHe should be grateful for one cookie for one lesson.

If your SIL thinks Tate should have more of a snack than 1 cookie after his lesson because of his appetite lately, she can provide additional snacks for her kid.  \n\nHonestly, if you provide the same number of cookies next time, you'll come off as very gracious.  Many people would immediately stop making cookies after the entitlement your SIL showed.  The only thing you should say in response to a free cookie for your kid is \"thank you\".", "NTA. You don\u2019t owe Tate any cookies. It\u2019s a really nice gesture that you\u2019re giving him one after each lesson! But for him to expect three or more cookies after each lesson, and for his mom to expect you bake three or more cookies after each lesson is excessive.\n\nAnd really, this could have gone either way. If you\u2019d routinely given him three cookies per lesson, at some point his mom might have been like, \u201cwhy are you always feeding him so many cookies??\u201d Personally, I think when it comes to feeding junk food to other people\u2019s kids, less is always the safer option. If it seems important to her that he have three cookies after each lesson, she\u2019s welcome to bake more at home.\n\nETA: I\u2019m a mom whose kids take private music lessons. If their teacher gave them three cookies once, I\u2019d be like, \u201coh, that was nice!\u201d If he gave them three cookies every lesson, I\u2019d probably be on here asking if I was the AH for asking him to stop giving them so many cookies.", "NTA - you\u2019re doing a nice thing providing a treat.

If your sister-in-law feels that he needs a bigger snack, she should provide it herself.", "NTA, SIL should be teaching her kids to say thank you for whatever they\u2019re offered and not expect more (if anything). She can bake her own homemade cookies if her kid NEEDS 5.", "NTA. Why would he assume he would get 3 cookies every lesson, or even any at all? Why would your SIL think that just because you have dough in the freezer, you're obligated to bake as much as she thinks you should? It all sounds a bit entitled, honestly. What will they do if you don't bake anything next week, demand that you turn on the oven at once?", "NTA.  Entitled sister teaching kid to be demanding.  You were being extremely nice & generous.  Her criticism of you was completely uncalled for.

Now God forbid you're too busy to make cookies on piano lesson day. \n\nNTA, but it's going to always be expected now. I agree with others who said you shouldn't cater to an entitled 5 y.o. and his mother by making a lot of cookies for them every week.\n\nLong ago, I moved into a new house during the summer. The kids were used to playing in my back yard with the little girl who previously lived there. So, I bought some popsicles, and the next time all the kids were playing in my yard, I offered all of them one. Big mistake! I had kids knocking on my back door asking for popsicles for *years* after that! I made a point never to have any on hand again. Kids are trained faster than Pavlov's dog.", "NTA.
