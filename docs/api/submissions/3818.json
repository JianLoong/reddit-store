{"id": 3818, "submission_id": "zb3lux", "title": "AITA for baking one cookie per person?", "selftext": "This is beyond trivial but I'd like to know what other people think, especially parents.\n\nLast weekend, my nephew Tate (5) started coming over for piano lessons with my husband. My SIL and brother brought him, along with my niece (3). I had a few cookies left over from a batch I'd made the day before, and I told Tate that if he listened to my husband during the lesson, there'd be a cookie waiting for him after.\n\nEveryone hung out in another room for about 20 minutes while my husband and Tate did the lesson. Afterward, I gave him and my niece a cookie. He asked for another one, and then a third, finishing them off. His parents were cool with it and mentioned his appetite's been large lately.\n\nI saw Tate a few days later (we get together for dinner every week with my parents) and he seemed to think he will always get a cookie after his lesson, as a matter of fact, which I thought was pretty cute and don't mind obliging.\n\nThis week, I made and froze a few dozen different types of cookie dough balls for Christmas. So when Tate came over today for lesson #2 with his mom, dad, and sister in tow, I popped six cookies in the oven: one for every person. After the lesson, I put the cookies out and everyone took one, including me. \n\nThe problem began when Tate finished his cookie and asked for another one. I told him I only made one for everyone. Soon after that, I mentioned to my SIL all the cookie dough I'd been making lately. She asked if I had more ready to bake, why didn't I bake more than six, since I knew Tate would want more than one?\n\nI didn't really have a good answer. I said I didn't want to use up all the cookies that were intended for Christmas, which was part of it, but it sounded kind of lame on its own. The truth was it did occur to me to bake more, but I thought one celebratory cookie after a music lesson seems... appropriate. Like a healthy, structured ritual. Whereas having three or more cookies seems like it's crossing the line into anarchy (I am kidding of course, just having a hard time conveying my feeling on this).\n\nEven though I didn't say any of this, I think it came across, because my SIL and brother seemed tense and left pretty quickly. Now I feel like maybe I was imposing my own morals on them, which may not have been cool.  They're not my kids. I don't even have kids.\n\nSo Reddit, AITA? Should I double up on cookies next week?", "created_utc": 1670029602, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zb3lux/aita_for_baking_one_cookie_per_person/", "score": 314, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You don\u2019t owe Tate any cookies. It\u2019s a really nice gesture that you\u2019re giving him one after each lesson!
