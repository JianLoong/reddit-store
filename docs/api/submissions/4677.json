And seriously  if you can't go without a joint for 3 hours, it's time for professional help.", "YTA... not listening to authority is not grounds to ignore BOUNDARIES.\n\nTime you stayed on the curb, dog\n\nand perfect example of choosing beggars.  You can't choose to not comply to the guy that's giving you the ride. how stupid can you get", "YTA, his car his rules", "YTA, he specifically said not to, and you thought he wouldn't mind? You can't go 3 hours without a joint? You need help. I enjoy a smoke as much as the next person, but he could have just pulled over and kicked you out of the car", "YTA", "YTA. A friend once got busted in a rural community (speed trap, not speeding) both were busted because they brought a dog to smell the car.  They found what could have been weed or it could have been dried grass/a plant.  The driver swore she never allowed weed in her minivan (3 kids), but it didn't matter because neither of them could afford the legal fees to fight it.  It stunk of illegal entrapment and small town police padding their revenue.  Didn't matter.  Both have misdemeanor records that limit their employment opportunities.", "YTA\n\nHis car, his rules.\n\nIf you have a problem with that, don't go in the effin car.", "YTA. When someone gives you a ride, you either follow their rules or walk.", "YTA", "YTA. Not smoking in someone's car is a really basic request and you showed a complete lack of respect when you did it anyway. I would've kicked you out of my car too. Also, if you can't go three hours without smoking a joint you have a serious problem. And that's coming from a longtime stoner", "YTA big time.\n\nTime to grow up and control your dependencies FFS. He told you that he didn't want and smoking and you did it anyway? Ofc you are an ass then. If you want to smoke in the car (and lower its value) then get your own car FFS.", "only had to read the title YES YTA!!!\n\ndon\u2019t smoke in small confined spaces, and certainly not inside someone else\u2019s property. they will have to put up with the disgusting smell for a lot longer than that journey. it\u2019s not like they can drive with the windows down at the moment to get fresh air in.", "You already know you are an asswhole why are you asking. A boundary was made and you accepted that boundry WHEN YOU DECIDED TO TSKE THE CAR RIDE. You knew your own limits and abilities and could have adapted by not going or finding an alternative lift. You had the option of doing things differently, and you chose to cross an explicitly stated boundary.  Plus you are introducing smoke to people who did not consent when that can impact their bodies as well. \n\nI am still stuck on the \"I thought be would not care I disregarded his boundry because I thought he was enoght like me.\"\n\nYTA \n\nOne a more concerned note, not being able to go that long for a smoke is concerning for your health. You might want to look into that. Addiction is a slippery slope where we can look for excused and justification to use and hurt others for our own gain. \n\nTake a moment to think about your priorities for the future, think about how you would feel if a \"friend\" crossed your boundaries like that and what you want for the future. \n\nIf you only want to smoke, make friends who want that and don't put others in positions they don't want to be in.", "This can\u2019t be real. Or you\u2019re like 16", "YTA and the words you said to him after he already asked you to not smoke were..insane", "YTA. You want a ride, you abide by the owners rules.", "YTA. Let's just say: if you were a passenger in my car, I would've stopped at the next pump station or parking place, any place where I could safely pull over. And kick you out. If you can't follow that one rule, you can figure out your ride yourself.\n\nI'm a non-smoker. Even when the window is rolled down, I would still notice the smoke, especially since joints have a way clearer (to me at least) smell than cigarettes. I hate sitting in smoke from other people.\n\nIf I'm the one getting a ride from a smoker, I would just accept it if they smoke (and probably roll down my window so I can get some fresh air), but be very appreciative if they don't smoke with me there.\n\nIf I'm giving a ride to a smoker, I don't mind pulling over so they can smoke.

Weed isn\u2019t physically addictive in the same way that things like nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, heroin, and cocaine are, but anything that affects your neuro chemistry (which is literally everything) can become psychologically addictive. \n\nThat\u2019s why things like shopping, gambling, gaming, and sex can all be addictive too. Our bodies don\u2019t become physically dependent on them, but the compulsion and cravings are still just as strong.", "I have too much time on my hands today, apparently", "Absolutely no idea what that is.", "I have absolutely no idea what siva is, should I?\n\nI scrolled past them.", "Yea"]}
