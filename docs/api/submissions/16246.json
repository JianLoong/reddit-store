We were searching for an AirBnB on the lake to stay in. We found a really nice one for pretty cheap, but on the downside it only had 2 twin sized beds and a couch. A pretty small, uncomfortable looking couch at that. \n\nI made a joke along the lines of, \u201calright, you two can duel amongst yourselves who gets to sleep in the twin and who gets the couch.\u201d Immediately they exchange annoyed glances between each other. \u201cWhy do you automatically get one of the twin beds? Now that you\u2019ve said that, I think you should be the one to sleep on the couch.\u201d\n\nThis kinda pissed me off because I thought it would be pretty self explanatory: I was a gymnast for 10+ years, had a bad fall and broke my back. Unfortunately, given that it was my lower back, it never healed completely and I still have a lot of issues and pain. I literally just had a surgery in Feb, which I\u2019m still recovering from and going to PT for. Not to mention that neither of them drives, so I\u2019m the one making the 5+ hour drive to Lake Michigan. Long drives are killer on my back, so it\u2019s pretty shit to then expect me to sleep on an uncomfortable couch.\n\nI voiced all of this to them and I got the response, \u201ctbh, I don\u2019t care about your back. Kinda seems like a non problem to me. I\u2019m tired of hearing about it. Just because you have a bad back doesn\u2019t mean you automatically get the bed. Toughen up, you\u2019re not going to get special treatment for it.\u201d To which I could only respond, \u201cI wish you had some concept of the pain that I endure every single day, because if you did, you wouldn\u2019t be fighting me on this.\u201d To which she just sarcastically replied, \u201cIf I had your back issues, I wouldn\u2019t be such a whiny little bitch about it.\u201d At that point I called off the trip and left her house. Tbh, at that point I called off the entire friendship. Haven\u2019t talked to either of them in like a week now.\n\nLike back issues aside, if I\u2019m making the 10hr total drive in my car. With my gas money. It seems obvious that I should get 1st pick when it comes to sleeping arrangements. Like right?

You sounds entitled and from the way they reacted I wonder how often the back card is pulled by you and they're tired of it.\n\nI really don't understand why this was even an issue and 2 of you couldn't just share one of the beds?

You assumed you got it, and judging by the only thing I can, your words,  you were pretty entitled in your story.  A better approach should have been the \"I'll drive if I can have\"    100% not saying you don't have back issues or minimizing the severity of them, but the assumption was what makes YTA.", "ESH\n\n\n\nYou really are no angel either.

But think would have led with that. People don't get chronic pain from injuries until they get one. Think if you think I'm driving 5 hours to sleep on a couch, then you'd better be joking, better. Especially as everyone should want a well-rested driver.", "You did totally the right thing. Your friends are jerks. Good job calling it off trip and friendship", "You are definitely NTA and had very valid reasons for requiring a bed.  The reaction of the others show they are not your friends.", "NTA. This couch just helped you get rid of foul friends. Save a little bit more and go by yourself, or enjoy the trip with someone who actually has empathy.", "NTA, all of the explanations about why the couch sucks for you are irrelevant; the couch sucks. Draw lots or straws or cards or something to see who gets the couch.", "NTA\n\nI'm glad you called off the trip.  They are jerks, and definitely the AH's.", "NTA. A friend wouldn't call you a whiny little bitch.\n\nThat said, your initial reaction of \"because my back\" came across as entitled when I was reading your post.\n\nYour \"back issues aside\" comment about using your car to get everyone there, you doing the driving, and you paying for gas is what you should have led with. Your \"friend\" maybe could have countered by offering to do the driving so that you could better care for your back during the drive, or you paying a smaller share of the AirBnB cost.

Good for you for noping out of that \"friendship\" and not putting yourself through that trip", "NTA. I think having a bad back doesn\u2019t automatically mean you get the bed (though a considerate friend wouldn\u2019t balk at the suggestion), but I DO think that since you\u2019re the driver that entitles you to a bed. Maybe my own rules of etiquette but I think if you\u2019re driving 5 hours while they get to move around or sleep or whatever then you should automatically get one of the beds for that discomfort alone.", "YTA.

Literally was wheelchair bound bc of it for quite a while. Had to take time off of school and do extensive PT just to walk correctly again. So yeah, maybe it\u2019s something I talk about a lot, but as I said it\u2019s become a big part of my life as suddenly not being able to walk would be and again I can\u2019t really control it lol", "Also, as for us just sharing the beds, they\u2019re twin sized and not all of us are tiny lol", "I wish there was a \u201ckind of an asshole\u201d verdict. It\u2019s not crazy to expect a bed, especially after driving everyone there but to approach it with that sense of entitlement? I don\u2019t know man, people don\u2019t like that kind of behavior. It\u2019ll put a sour taste in their mouth and that\u2019s exactly what happened. OP should\u2019ve said \u201cI would really appreciate one of the beds since I\u2019m driving all of us, paying for gas, and I have a bad back as you both know. Thanks guys.\u201d They probably would\u2019ve been more than happy to give it to OP if they were nicer about it.", "She broke her back.", "Exactly! It\u2019s crazy to think of getting a place that doesn\u2019t have enough beds. It\u2019s also crazy that the driver would pay for all the gas. For me that would be an immediate NOPE. They can drive separately if they aren\u2019t at absolute minimum paying for their share of gas.", "That was what I was planning on thinking. But then the details of their disdain for her medical condition made me think that all the beds in the world couldn't save this friendship.", "exactly!  before i even got to ur comment, i thought why not get one w/ enuff beds?? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "I'm sorry that happened to you and I hope you're doing better! I'm still wondering why sharing a bed wasn't considered as a option? Obviously now after what they said to you the trip is no longer happening but this seems like it would have been a very quick and logical solution", "I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re getting down voted here.
