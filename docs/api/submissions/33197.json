James also has two children Grace (13f) and Luke (14m) with his ex-wife, Sharon (36f). Sharon and James have been divorced for 12 years and ever since Sharon has been in a string of relationships and had four additional children who are ages 10 and under. She is currently married and has three stepchildren who are 7 and under.\n\nJames has always been willing to help Sharon out if needed so the kids can see them getting along and so they know he always does his best for them and their mom. But now he wants *me* to go a step further than he ever has and he wants me to babysit all of Sharon's kids since I'm a SAHM technically, but I do run my own online business to earn money and am able to do that around everything else in my life. He said Sharon is struggling to find childcare for all the children she has and her husband is a bit of a deadbeat. I found out after that Grace asked her dad to help out because she was worried about her mom.\n\nI told James that was too much for me. He said he would help where he could and I wouldn't need to worry about the money side because he would take care of it. I told him that's a lot though and honestly too overwhelming for me. He was frustrated with me and I told him I didn't appreciate the pressure he was putting on me.\n\nLater Sharon calls and tells me she wants to start dropping off the kids after Christmas. I told her I hadn't agreed. She told me James had told her I would do it. She then told me that I should be willing to help out and it would win the kids over (Grace and Luke) to me and maybe even to my son (their half brother).\n\nI told James he had no right to promise anything on my behalf. He told me he believed I would be on board and he was surprised I was so against it when I never had a problem with him helping. Then he asked me to give me a reason that couldn't be helped with getting someone in to help me take care of the kids.\n\nI told him he can just pay for people then if he's so determined but I won't be babysitting.\n\nI also told him we need marriage counseling because of this.\n\nAlso, and this might be meaningless but I feel I should confess it here. Another reason I am unwilling, even if it wasn't so much hard work, is the fact Grace and Luke have never shown an interest in my son. But their half siblings from their mom and stepsiblings from her? It's totally different. I think it's because they consider all of them, even the steps, their mom's kids. But with my son, he's mine and not as much their dad's. They are not fond of me or of their mom's husband. It's something I have been working on. But I admit the idea of having all the kids and as my son gets a bit older, him watching his two siblings treat their other siblings so much better makes me say no anyway.\n\nAnyway, Sharon is calling me an ass and saying I am not thinking of my stepkids.

You have 1 kid and 2 step children who are old enough to be mostly self sufficient. You are not free labor to be used and taken advantage of just because your a stay at home parent.

Because volunteering you to care for 7 additional children (your child and his 2 are a given that you'd need to provide care for) even once, let alone on a regular basis is plain insanity. Nevermind that those 7 children are all under 10 years of age! \n\nAlso, it does matter that his other kids don't seem to care for your son. Protecting his feelings here is as important as not allowing your husband to walk all over you. I'd be telling your husband to rescind the offer to babysit or you'll leave and he can do it himself.

Sharon has 4 additional bio kids and 3 step kids at her place, so potentially, there are NINE children at any given time at Sharon\u2019s house. Sharon is overwhelmed, I get it.\n\nI think what is happening is Sharon is pushing daycare onto Grace and Luke because they are the oldest. Grace approaches her dad asking for help, and her dad\u2019s solution is to get his current wife to babysit.  He\u2019s probably getting pressure from Sharon, Grace, and Luke to relieve the pressure from them to take care of all these kids.  \n\nOP, not the asshole for refusing to babysit all of these children.
