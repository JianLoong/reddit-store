James also has two children Grace (13f) and Luke (14m) with his ex-wife, Sharon (36f). Sharon and James have been divorced for 12 years and ever since Sharon has been in a string of relationships and had four additional children who are ages 10 and under. She is currently married and has three stepchildren who are 7 and under.\n\nJames has always been willing to help Sharon out if needed so the kids can see them getting along and so they know he always does his best for them and their mom. But now he wants *me* to go a step further than he ever has and he wants me to babysit all of Sharon's kids since I'm a SAHM technically, but I do run my own online business to earn money and am able to do that around everything else in my life. He said Sharon is struggling to find childcare for all the children she has and her husband is a bit of a deadbeat. I found out after that Grace asked her dad to help out because she was worried about her mom.\n\nI told James that was too much for me. He said he would help where he could and I wouldn't need to worry about the money side because he would take care of it. I told him that's a lot though and honestly too overwhelming for me. He was frustrated with me and I told him I didn't appreciate the pressure he was putting on me.\n\nLater Sharon calls and tells me she wants to start dropping off the kids after Christmas. I told her I hadn't agreed. She told me James had told her I would do it. She then told me that I should be willing to help out and it would win the kids over (Grace and Luke) to me and maybe even to my son (their half brother).\n\nI told James he had no right to promise anything on my behalf. He told me he believed I would be on board and he was surprised I was so against it when I never had a problem with him helping. Then he asked me to give me a reason that couldn't be helped with getting someone in to help me take care of the kids.\n\nI told him he can just pay for people then if he's so determined but I won't be babysitting.\n\nI also told him we need marriage counseling because of this.\n\nAlso, and this might be meaningless but I feel I should confess it here. Another reason I am unwilling, even if it wasn't so much hard work, is the fact Grace and Luke have never shown an interest in my son. But their half siblings from their mom and stepsiblings from her? It's totally different. I think it's because they consider all of them, even the steps, their mom's kids. But with my son, he's mine and not as much their dad's. They are not fond of me or of their mom's husband. It's something I have been working on. But I admit the idea of having all the kids and as my son gets a bit older, him watching his two siblings treat their other siblings so much better makes me say no anyway.\n\nAnyway, Sharon is calling me an ass and saying I am not thinking of my stepkids. James thinks I should have been willing to work with him to figure out a compromise.

You and DH need counseling STAT.  And I would be telling DH that no one cares about your kid", "NTA\n\nLet me get this straight. Your husband wants you to watch 3 kids including a newborn infant from your blended family and then add 4 more kids who are under the age of 10 to your routine daily. So basically 7 kids all by your self all day every single day? Fuck that. That's daycare ratios. He wants you to be responsible for an entire daycare room full of kids every day and not be paid for it. That's a lot of fucking work. You didn't sign up to have 7 kids. You have 1 kid and 2 step children who are old enough to be mostly self sufficient. You are not free labor to be used and taken advantage of just because your a stay at home parent. Your responsibility is to your own child...whose care will DEFINITELY suffer and be neglected....if you have to split your attention 7 different ways. I wouldn't agree to that either unless there was a massive pay out for it...like full price daycare charges per kid.", "U.K. \n\nThe number of children involved would get a daycare closed down due to inadequate adult supervision.

A reasonable suggestion from your husband in this situation would be asking if your 2 step children live with you. Not expecting you to run a daycare for free for other people's 9 children, of which only 2 are related to your husband.\n\nCounselling would be a good idea, cus what kind of weird hold does his ex have on him that he thinks it's in any way reasonable for him to ask this if you?", "NTA \u2026 stand your ground DO NOT LET THEM GUILT, BULLY OR MANIPULATE YOU \n\nif this is a hill your hubby is willing to die on , I\u2019d be leaving ( I may have already when he said yes after you had already said you wouldn\u2019t do it )", "You're not the asshole, but I think you have a lot of unpacking to do based on the side thoughts you had in the explanation.", "Fuck that.

Where are the step kids other parent/parents? That is a lot of kids to put on one person. It would be one thing if it was an emergency like the mom was in the hospital but they completely want you to be a daycare!", "NTA. If your husband wants to help so much, tell your husband to quit his job and become a SAHP to provide childcare for his ex-wife's kids. What he is asking is for you to do all the work and slave away for his ex's family while taking away your financial autonomy. Never do this!", "NTA and who thinks 7 additional children isn\u2019t a huge burden?

Sharon gets to earn money, her husband gets to continue to provide as much or as little as he chooses, and James gets to feel magnanimous without putting in any real effort.

This poor woman should cut her losses and be done with the whole circus.", "James thinks I should have been willing to work with him to figure out a compromise. AITA?", "She does, I think.\n\nIt's more that if the kids ask James will go out of his way to help Sharon. He's less ready to jump for a request directly from her but still normally will. But one of his kids? He doesn't really stop to think as much.", "Sharon's husband appears to be very checked out of the marriage and his kids. Not sure about their mother(s). Sharon's other children's fathers are not in the picture either.", "As it should be.  I think that if Sharon had, like, **one** additional sibling, especially if they were 12 or older, there would be wiggle room for you to be backup backup backup care if there's real need.  But with a football team's worth of offspring and a husband who doesn't respect you, you need to draw the line.", "So you'd be watching 10 kids in total?? That's not a reasonable request... In an emergency situation for 1 day/evening, maybe and only if you're up for it. But regular daycare doesn't even allow that many kids with 1 person...\n\nIt would also bother me a lot that your husband goes that far to help his ex. I get he's probably doing this for the benefit of his kids, but this is taking it very far...", "WTF? So basically your husband and the ex- wife wants you to run a child care center. No way, he is out of his mind. Does he realize the kind of stress he will put you through?  Not your circus not your monkeys. BTW you are NOT a SAHM, you work from home. This post\u2019s title should be something along the lines of: my husband wants me to run a child care center for his ex-wive\u2019s 5 children free of charge", "Oh, for the love of-- That's not babysitting, that's daycare.  Which your husband can pay for at professional rates at a qualified institution if he wishes.\n\nI have a feeling your two step kids attitudes may change because this is heading right down the Parentification Trail.", "Wtf! Even 3 kids is a lot of you aren\u2019t a trained professional. She shouldn\u2019t of have had all those kids and married a dead beat. Also your husband willing to pay for kids of another woman is concerning. This sounds like a life long headache! \n\nMy ex and I have a great relationship, but I\u2019m not his responsibility. And if he was married I\u2019d consult his wife on how comfortable she is with certain things.", "It\u2019s abusive to volunteer you to watch all these kids without your consent. Think long and hard about how he had no trouble resisting your no to watching them. It\u2019s sounds like he has a lot of trouble saying no to ex and zero trouble manipulating you to get his own way.", "It's such a massive show of lack of respect or consideration for you that it is genuinely concerning. What does he even think of you? How could he possibly think that dumping all of this in your lap without even asking would be okay?\n\nNTA The counseling is certainly needed, even if just to find out what the hell he's thinking and what his priorities are.", "Be sure to tell both of them IN TEXTS that if they drop the children off you will be calling the police. Go to your support system since James clearly is not it.", "It\u2019s the mothers I was wondering about.  Either way, you\u2019re definitely NTA."]}
