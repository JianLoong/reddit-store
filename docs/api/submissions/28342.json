And why, you might ask, aren't they your friends after all? Well, in theory, yes. But do I REALLY know them? We met online, and there are so many scams nowadays that I don't want to get burn for being naive and nice.\n\nFurthermore, there were a few red flags (or some situations that I could be misinterpreting now as I am not very happy with what they are requesting of me). Not long ago, they mentioned that they wanted to have another citizenship (of my country or another). Then, regarding this trip, they asked for my home address a few times... First, in order to have a phone card that works here, then to order something from Amazon.... (Why send it to my house, in a foreign country? Besides, it's a rly common and cheap object). It is easy to falsify that responsibility statement, they could just fill the information needed and fake my signature. They posture overall was kinda taking me for granted and way too comfortable.\n\nI might be overthinking here....!\n\nAnyway, I was clear with them and told them I was not feeling comfortable on signing that document as it is a huge responsibility. I will gladly open my house to them, but I don't want any problems with the law.\n\nOf course, they got upset by this, saying that I am kinda ruining their honeymoon as without that document they can't enter my country and I should not live my life in fear and blablabla...  I get that they are mad, I get it. I would be too. But, at the same time, I don't want to take that risk.

What do you think? AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPS: In the meantime, they found another friend (just within a few hours :o ) and they will stay with him and he will sign that responsibility statement.

You only have their word.\n\nIt all ties back to this: how the hell do you know these people are your friends, or even who they say they are?\n\nBecause they wanted you to fill out a form to get them into the border, frankly, I suspect they're involved in something insanely illegal and dangerous. Sorry dude, I'm pretty sure you got extremely got.
