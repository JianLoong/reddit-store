We are all between 26 - 30, unmarried with no children. Three cousins told us they would have their partners with them, so that brought the total to 8 people.\n\nWe told everyone the food would be Asian themed and to let us know of any food restrictions. Nobody has any food allergies but one cousin, Zach, told us that his girlfriend Maria (27) is a vegetarian.\n\nMy sister and I made 8 dishes and put them in plates and bowls for everyone to serve themselves. For Maria, we made spinach curry and miso-glazed eggplants. There was also steamed rice to go with the food. The other dishes had some kind of meat in them.\n\nEveryone had a great time and Maria thanked us for the food though I noticed she ate very little. She had two large helpings of the store bought ice cream we served as dessert though. Zach was not as talkative as usual but I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nZach later called us that while we had so many meat dishes, he felt we did not accommodate Maria enough by providing only two vegetarian options. That was why she had so much ice cream because she was so hungry from not being able to eat our food. I told him if Maria was such a picky eater he could have told us what exactly she likes to eat, so we could cook exactly what pleased her, maybe a little too obvious I was being sarcastic. Zach told us our food was too exotic and we should at least provide some fries which was what everyone could eat.\n\nI don\u2019t believe my sister and I were AH at all. My sister, however, thought maybe Zach was right and we should have taken into account that some people don\u2019t do well with exotic dishes.

It was rude of your cousin to criticize your efforts.  I think that the french fry suggestion was unreasonable, you told everyone the lunch was going to be Asian-themed.

Usually there\u2019s one dubious option that\u2019s not even really vegetarian (non veggies often don\u2019t realize how much animal product is snuck into random foods/sauces/etc.) Also - it\u2019s rude to complain to the host if you don\u2019t like the food.

Seven of them could enjoy all eight dishes, and did.

The non-vegetarians are going to eat the vegetarian dishes as well as the meat dishes, so either you make extra-large portions of the vegetarian dishes or else reverse the proportions - six vegetarian to two meat.\n\nI'm a vegetarian and I've gone to a dinner party catered by a devout meat-eater where the centre dish was a roast duck.

But neither spinach nor eggplant are particularly filling, and even combined with rice, it doesn't really make a balanced meal.  There isn't really a source of protein, it's a meal where you're going to fill up with rice, and the vegetable dishes provide flavor, but not much sustenance.  Eating extra ice cream would help balance that a bit.\n\nI do wonder about what Maria really feels, since you're getting her perspective only through the filter of Zach.\n\nFries wouldn't have turned this into a balanced vegetarian meal.  A vegetarian would know that, a non-vegetarian who was using the vegetarian as an excuse to complain might not.  You might want to call Maria directly, find out whether the meal worked for her, or if Zach is the one who is picky and wanted fries.\n\nThe meal you provided was on the lean side, balanced by dessert. Not a problem.\n\nBut there isn't enough evidence to know if this is Maria's complaint, or Zach's.  This doesn't feel like a complaint coming from a vegetarian perspective.

Those are totally separate things.\"", "NTA you provided food that was not only vegetarian but sounded delicious and accommodating. It's not like you just got her a salad.

I eat meat, but I also eat vegetarian some of the time. Maria is not just a vegetarian, she has a limited palate. Fries are not typically served with Asian food as far as I know. They sound tiring.", "NTA ~ you told him the food would be Asian themed. If he knew she wouldn\u2019t eat that he could\u2019ve given you the heads up so you could plan accordingly.", "I don't like the sound of either dish, mainly because I cant handle spicy and I don't like eggplant BUT  I'd warn you ahead of time of those issues so they could be accommodated for.

This affects what I can participate in and I pay the same dues to cover costs as everyone else (already losing out because I'm a teetotaler and apparently water is the only possible alternative and have food allergies). The response? \"The last event had two side dishes, peas and carrots, so if you don't like it that's one thing but we always accommodate everyone. If you have suggestions of caterers we'll be happy to accommodate.\" If I ate the amount of peas and carrots it would take to be equivalent to one of the filling meat options, there would be none left for anyone else, including other vegetarians. So I'm not sure how that works out in their reasoning.\n\nTwo weeks later I got the flier for the next event stating \"no vegetarian options will be provided.\" Umm, thanks for proving my point? The week after that I went to an event where they had a cheese platter done so that alternating meat and cheese slices were overlapping forming a ring shape.\n\nSo NTA.

Sadly, the food, it doesn't return my fervor ;) I have allergies, though my food allergies aren't as serious as my other allergies. \n\nStill, they are moderate. I can't eat those foods, esp. repeatedly, without the allergic reaction turning into serious, difficult to beat, upper respiratory infections. The other foods my body doesn't like, aren't true allergies, but do cause immediate pain, and other obvious illness - which snowball, if I'm exposed to more of any one of them. Hence, I am EXTRAORDINARILY THANKFUL when hosts are amenable to allowing me to bring a few dishes that fulfill my long list of requirements. In my book, it's MY job to accommodate my issue, as it's dar too complex to expect someone else to pick up in an afternoon, esp. without my help. I'm only ever frustrated, when they aren't willing to let me bring something (unless of course it's a formal event, and wouldn't appropriate).
