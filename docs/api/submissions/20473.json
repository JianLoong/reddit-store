We are all between 26 - 30, unmarried with no children. Three cousins told us they would have their partners with them, so that brought the total to 8 people.\n\nWe told everyone the food would be Asian themed and to let us know of any food restrictions. Nobody has any food allergies but one cousin, Zach, told us that his girlfriend Maria (27) is a vegetarian.\n\nMy sister and I made 8 dishes and put them in plates and bowls for everyone to serve themselves. For Maria, we made spinach curry and miso-glazed eggplants. There was also steamed rice to go with the food. The other dishes had some kind of meat in them.\n\nEveryone had a great time and Maria thanked us for the food though I noticed she ate very little. She had two large helpings of the store bought ice cream we served as dessert though. Zach was not as talkative as usual but I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nZach later called us that while we had so many meat dishes, he felt we did not accommodate Maria enough by providing only two vegetarian options. That was why she had so much ice cream because she was so hungry from not being able to eat our food. I told him if Maria was such a picky eater he could have told us what exactly she likes to eat, so we could cook exactly what pleased her, maybe a little too obvious I was being sarcastic. Zach told us our food was too exotic and we should at least provide some fries which was what everyone could eat.\n\nI don\u2019t believe my sister and I were AH at all. My sister, however, thought maybe Zach was right and we should have taken into account that some people don\u2019t do well with exotic dishes.

If she is not just a vegetarian but a picky vegetarian, she needs to bring her own food or at least make reasonable suggestions.\n\nIt was an Asian-themed lunch, and you cannot be expected to provide French fries. You all are adults, and it was an adult only party. You are not obligated to have a \"kid's menu\" for someone. If she doesn't like Asian food, then she was welcome to decline the invite.", "NTA - you were nice and attentive enough to provide TWO vegetarian options. If she didn\u2019t like them - that\u2019s not your problem at all. \nYour food sounded amazing and as a fellow veggie I\u2019d have loved to have eaten it and even if it wasn\u2019t to my liking, I\u2019d have just eaten the Ice-cream and maybe had some snacks when I got home. The thought and time that went into it would\u2019ve been more than enough! \nI\u2019d even go as far to say Maria should be apologising to you that she didn\u2019t eat much after you spent the time making two separate options primarily for her", "NTA - food was provided, she didn\u2019t like it, not your problem", "NTA. \"Exotic\" my a**. Those dishes sound great. Maria's an adult, not a little kid.", "Nta, two dishes for one person sounds fine. If she had further restrictions they either should have said something or gotten something before the party.", "NTA. Two dishes plus rice is plenty. The issue wasn't the meat but that the dishes were \"exotic\" and both are pretty much Asian staples and tasty. You don't expect fries at an Asian lunch.", "NTA\nZach\u2019s gf knew she was attending an Asian themed lunch. If she was a picky eater the onus is on her to fill up before lunch. Or bring her own fries.", "NTA. I'm vegetarian and two dishes would be fine for me, as long as I had food to eat.\n\nThe issue isn't that there were two vegetarian dishes- it was the food was \"exotic.\" It sounds like not unusual, IMO, and you're right- he should've given you head's up.", "I hear two complaints from Zach. \"Exotic\" and \"vegetarian\".\n\nHis suggestion of fries instead of rice doesn't address the vegetarian complaint, only the exotic complaint.\n\nNTA", "100% NTA.", "NTA. . . You provided 2 out of 8 items that were focused on her. Shes being ungrateful and your borther is being petty obeying and passing along her whine.", "NTA. We were told growing up that if we didn't like something we were served at a party, just say we weren't hungry and we could stop and get McDonald's or something on the way home.", "Um. How are spinach and eggplant exotic? You are NTA. They're whiny.", "NTA. Two special vegetarian dishes is great. And who knew french fries were Asian themed?", "NTA. In this situation, the only info you had was that she was veg\u2026 the fact you made two dishes and your cousin and gf still thought to complain is ridiculous. He should have said something like, \u201cshe loves this food but doesn\u2019t really like that food\u201d if she\u2019s a finicky eater. \n\nAm I alone in thinking those aren\u2019t even exotic dishes? I\u2019m vegan so I eat my fair share of uncommon/\u201cexotic\u201dveggies\u2026. but spinach and eggplant? You weren\u2019t serving jackfruit or that weird looking romanesco stuff, I don\u2019t get it!!\n\nEdit: changed brother to cousin after realizing my mistake", "for reference, offering a protein option would've been good, typically a legume or tofu, but no it's obviously not your fault she went to an Asian themed lunch when she doesn't like Asian food.", "NTA.  As a vegetarian 2 choices is fine", "you went out of your way to make a real meal for her . if she wanted fries, she could have communicated that but \u201cI\u2019m vegetarian \u201c is not enough information to surmise that she is also a picky eater (or hates a specific ingredient). I\u2019m vegan and would never expect that much effort from my partners cousin; it would be a very pleasant surprise \n\nNTA", "NTA, you were sweet and accommodating. Asking for more than you provided is honestly pretty entitled. You also were clear with the menu. I\u2019m the pickiest person I know, and if I\u2019m not confident there will be food I like, I eat before I go and say I have a small appetite that day. Who goes somewhere where someone made food and whines that the food wasn\u2019t specifically catered to them?", "NTA. He should have made her dietary wants clear or not brought her. Who makes french fries at an adult dinner party that is serving Asian cuisine?\n\nI will also say that it's kinda rude to refer to a different culture's foods as being too \"exotic\" so they are A H's for that.", "You made 2 out of 8 dishes specifically for 1 person. \n\nUnless this 2 dishes were extra spicy (or much \"unusual\" seasoning) the reaction of of Zach was unreasonable.\n\nNTA", "NTA- My eyes just rolled so hard back into my head, I was afraid they'd get stuck. You made 2 whole dishes for your cousin's girlfriend, and you'd think as a vegetarian she's be grateful for something OTHER than fries, which require almost zero effort. If she's that picky of an eater she should just eat at home or a restaurant of her choosing.", "NTA. Most normal people who go to an event that don't like the food just forget about it and move on with their day. It just sounds so entitled to expect everyone to accomodate you to the fullest extent, and then when they do go out of their way to make you dishes, telling them it isn't enough or not the right kind of dish. I can't stand people like that, and they're some of the biggest AHs around.", "NTA. \n\n\nYou *did* accommodate her. And you let everybody know ahead of time that the theme would be Asian food. On what planet do fries fit in this category. If she has food restrictions *and* is such a picky eater, perhaps bringing her own food is in everyone's best interest.", "NTA\n\nIt appears that you and your sister made an effort to accommodate Maria.   It was rude of your cousin to criticize your efforts.  I think that the french fry suggestion was unreasonable, you told everyone the lunch was going to be Asian-themed.  Why they would think that you would or should have made french fries is ridiculous.  \n\nIf I was invited to lunch and the host went out of their way to make special dishes to suit my dietary choices.  Even if I hated what they made, I would have never complained and been churlish about it.  You should always be gracious and polite when someone goes out of their way to accommodate you.  The fact that your cousin and his girlfriend didn't just show their low character in my opinion.", "I'm a vegetarian for 30+ years.  No one has ever been so thoughtful to me or my friends by providing 2 out of the 8 dishes as veg friendly!  You are amazing.\n\nYour cousin forked up by not saying she was a picky eater and didn't like \"exotic\" food. \n\nMiso Glazed Eggplant is one of my favorite dishes. Her loss.\n\nWas the spinich curry thai, japanese or something else?  I'm not a fan of japanese curry, but love thai and indian ones.", "NTA. You were more than accommodating. The only reason you would provide French fries at a themed food party would be if kids were involved. If she wanted to eat like a child, though, she should have told you in advance.", "NTA. I\u2019m a vegetarian and I would be thrilled with two options plus rice. Usually there\u2019s one dubious option that\u2019s not even really vegetarian (non veggies often don\u2019t realize how much animal product is snuck into random foods/sauces/etc.) Also - it\u2019s rude to complain to the host if you don\u2019t like the food. It\u2019s not a restaurant. Come on.", "NTA. I had to double check that it was an adult complaining about the food, not a toddler. And (talking as an Asian), I always hate it when people use the word \u201cexotic\u201d to complain about food. There are scores of other words they could have used had she actually bothered to try them - bland, salty, spicy, pungent, etc.", "Several young vegetarians I know are incredibly unhealthy eaters.  Fries, bread, fried cheese, pasta.   Very little fruit or veggies.  Sounds like cousins GF is one of those.  She wants fries and other more fast food.   Your Asian themed party sounds wonderful and you had no way of knowing she wanted only fries and ice cream.   NTA.", "Two dishes was more than enough. And ice cream isn\u2019t vegan.", "NTAH no no nooooo! NTAH!!! Stop it. Accommodating anyone with a dietary PREFERENCE, not restriction is nice enough, making \u201cexotic\u201d (lololol) dishes specifically for them is even nicer. I always say if you can\u2019t eat normal food bring your own or be specific. That thing about this that bothers me is that they always feel ENTITLED. I understand medical restrictions and allergies. But no, just noooo!!! NTAH!!! And fries lololololol stop it.", "INFO: Was Maria the only one eating the two vegetarian dishes?", "NTA - What is she, a toddler? Try some new things. I just really can\u2019t stand picky eaters\u2014it\u2019s fine as a kid, but at some point you need to grow up and expand your palate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Two of the most popular and basic veg staples of each cuisine!  What is wrong with her?!?!?!?!", "Then, sorry, Y T A.\n\nYou provided eight dishes for eight people. Seven of them could enjoy all eight dishes, and did. One of them could only enjoy two dishes  - so she got, literally, a quarter of the food everyone else got.\n\nNo wonder she filled up on ice-cream.\n\nWhen catering for a mixed group of meat-eaters and vegetarians, no matter how few the vegetarians are, don't think in terms of providing one or two dishes the vegetarian can eat - think in terms of providing tasty food everyone can eat. The non-vegetarians are going to eat the vegetarian dishes as well as the meat dishes, so either you make extra-large portions of the vegetarian dishes or else reverse the proportions - six vegetarian to two meat.\n\nI'm a vegetarian and I've gone to a dinner party catered by a devout meat-eater where the centre dish was a roast duck. Everyone else tucked into duck and sides: I ate only the sides, but as the hostess had made all-vegetarian sides enough for a lovely meal, I had no problems and no need to fill up on fries or ice-cream.\n\nTell Maria you didn't think, and you'll do better next time!", "The portions are not equal though. The vegetarian dishes are much larger than the meat dishes. My sister and I did take that into account when we cooked.", "If she didn't like the dishes I'm not sure how restricting them so only she could eat them would improve the situation at all.", "Fair. Okay, NAH - except for maybe Zach who suggested you should do fries.   \n\n\nYou provided the lone vegetarian who wasn't in the family with two options, while all the other guests got eight. It's unequal treatment, but she wasn't your guest but the plus-one of a guest, and yeah, attending a stranger's house with unknown prospects for food, the sensible thing to do would have been to fill up beforehand, not ice-cream afterward."]}
