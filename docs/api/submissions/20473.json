We are all between 26 - 30, unmarried with no children. Three cousins told us they would have their partners with them, so that brought the total to 8 people.\n\nWe told everyone the food would be Asian themed and to let us know of any food restrictions. Nobody has any food allergies but one cousin, Zach, told us that his girlfriend Maria (27) is a vegetarian.\n\nMy sister and I made 8 dishes and put them in plates and bowls for everyone to serve themselves. For Maria, we made spinach curry and miso-glazed eggplants. There was also steamed rice to go with the food. The other dishes had some kind of meat in them.\n\nEveryone had a great time and Maria thanked us for the food though I noticed she ate very little. She had two large helpings of the store bought ice cream we served as dessert though. Zach was not as talkative as usual but I didn\u2019t think much of it.\n\nZach later called us that while we had so many meat dishes, he felt we did not accommodate Maria enough by providing only two vegetarian options. That was why she had so much ice cream because she was so hungry from not being able to eat our food. I told him if Maria was such a picky eater he could have told us what exactly she likes to eat, so we could cook exactly what pleased her, maybe a little too obvious I was being sarcastic. Zach told us our food was too exotic and we should at least provide some fries which was what everyone could eat.\n\nI don\u2019t believe my sister and I were AH at all. My sister, however, thought maybe Zach was right and we should have taken into account that some people don\u2019t do well with exotic dishes.

The non-vegetarians are going to eat the vegetarian dishes as well as the meat dishes, so either you make extra-large portions of the vegetarian dishes or else reverse the proportions - six vegetarian to two meat.\n\nI'm a vegetarian and I've gone to a dinner party catered by a devout meat-eater where the centre dish was a roast duck.

But neither spinach nor eggplant are particularly filling, and even combined with rice, it doesn't really make a balanced meal.  There isn't really a source of protein, it's a meal where you're going to fill up with rice, and the vegetable dishes provide flavor, but not much sustenance.  Eating extra ice cream would help balance that a bit.\n\nI do wonder about what Maria really feels, since you're getting her perspective only through the filter of Zach.\n\nFries wouldn't have turned this into a balanced vegetarian meal.

You might want to call Maria directly, find out whether the meal worked for her, or if Zach is the one who is picky and wanted fries.\n\nThe meal you provided was on the lean side, balanced by dessert. Not a problem.\n\nBut there isn't enough evidence to know if this is Maria's complaint, or Zach's.  This doesn't feel like a complaint coming from a vegetarian perspective.

This affects what I can participate in and I pay the same dues to cover costs as everyone else (already losing out because I'm a teetotaler and apparently water is the only possible alternative and have food allergies). The response? \"The last event had two side dishes, peas and carrots, so if you don't like it that's one thing but we always accommodate everyone. If you have suggestions of caterers we'll be happy to accommodate.\" If I ate the amount of peas and carrots it would take to be equivalent to one of the filling meat options, there would be none left for anyone else, including other vegetarians. So I'm not sure how that works out in their reasoning.\n\nTwo weeks later I got the flier for the next event stating \"no vegetarian options will be provided.\" Umm, thanks for proving my point?

He didn't warn you that she was so picky. It sounds like you made a great dinner.", "If there's a next time, put out a loaf of white bread and some peanut butter and jelly. It was a rule for my kids, if you dont want to eat what we made, there's always pb&j. I was a vegetarian for over 12 years. I would have been thrilled to be included like she was.", "NTA. Providing 2 vegetarian dishes with rice was very thoughtful. They knew the theme was Asian, so why would they expect French Fries?", "First, you didn't provide 2 dishes, you provided FOUR. She had two mains and rice, plus dessert. \n\nSecond, you said you would be serving asian themed food, so why would any adult think that french fries would have been an option?\n\nThird, with only one vegetarian, having 2 mains that suited her is totally sufficient. \n\nAnd finally, we have ALL been at a get together where we didn't get enough food. Sometimes it is because of dietary preferences or restrictions that eliminate food, or it could be the type of food, or it could just not taste good, or you could have watched the cats climb on the counter while food was cooking. You don't tell the host you weren't included or left hungry, you just get a big old cheeseburger on the way home.  \n\nIgnore this conversation fully from now on. Don't invite Zach and his partner to your stuff, but don't prevent them from coming places. If you are in charge of the food, continue to do your thing, if other's are in charge of the food, show up with the most exotic meat dish you can find (or just be normal and maybe warn that host the the girlfriend is a bit of a picky eater, not in a gossipy way). Just pretend this never happened and move on with your life.", "NTA- Picky eaters are childish and always whine when their ridiculous demands aren't met.", "They are ungrateful and close minded. Why would you have fries at an Asian theme diner ? I hate people like that. NTA", "Why would you cook fries or something when you told everyone ahead of time that the food theme was Asian-themed? Your cousin makes 0 sense. If Maria doesn\u2019t like exotic food, she didn\u2019t have to come knowing that\u2019s what was being served.\n\nYou and your sister are NTA.", "[removed]", "NTA. You asked. He answered. You made a dish. That's a nice gesture.", "Definitely NTA, and I say that as a *super* picky eater. Perhaps the flavor profile was a bit too exotic for her; I\u2019d still be touched that someone made the effort to accommodate me and, while I might not eat much of the exotic stuff, I could certainly have loaded up on the rice and been absolutely fine.   \n\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault when someone else is picky, especially if there are options that cater to their basic food needs (vegetarian option). If she\u2019s picky, then she is likely used to compensating at meals she hasn\u2019t prepared herself and didn\u2019t think much of it \u2014 it sounds more like your cousin was being over-protective and making a fuss where none was really required. I don\u2019t know that I\u2019d go so far as to call him an AH over it, but it was definitely a bit rude of him to tell you what he did afterwards.", "NTA:, what did she think would be served at an Asian styled brunch, plain tofu?\n\nNext time make vegan mac and cheese  and also complaining about food afterwards is rude.", "NTA big time. I\u2019m vegetarian. Have been for most of my adult life. \n\nUsually when I\u2019m at someone else\u2019s event, even if I RSVP vegetarian, my expectations are set at salad + bread. I don\u2019t expect anyone to change their entire menu for me because that\u2019s unreasonable and selfish- it\u2019s not my event, it\u2019s yours. I\u2019m there to celebrate the couple. \n\nThe easiest thing to do is eat at home beforehand, so even if the food is unappetizing, I\u2019m not hangry. \n\nIf someone cooked two entire dishes for me, I would be moved to tears. It\u2019s really nice of you guys to do that!", "Two vegetarian dishes provided AND you let everyone know you were making an Asian themed meal\u2026 sounds like you were clear and made it nice for everyone! NTA", "NTA. Instead of telling you Maria is a vegetarian, Zach should've told you Maria has the palate of a small child.", "NTA. My friend\u2019s stepdaughter is a  self-described \u201cmilitant vegan\u201d yet only eats spaghetti with plain tomato sauce. My friend is fairly sure it\u2019s really a badly ignored eating disorder, but her husband is in denial so she just keeps her mouth shut.", "Also vegetarian and I agree. If I ended up not really liking the two options, I still thank the host, nibble on what I can, then go get something else on the way home. Sucks but when attending a non-veggie gathering you typically expect the worst and get over it. The gathering is more about spending time with people than a free meal anyway.", "I am pescatarian, but frequently eat vegetarian. 100% agree with this comment. NTA.", "Tiny sidenote. Two vegetarian dishes out of eight is perfectly fair if there is plenty to go around. Unfortunately I've been to parties where they first serve dishes 1 and 2. They made them tiny, because there is only 1 vegetarian, and most guests like meat. But....everyone is hungry and digs in, so you only get two tiny scoops, and then when the other dishes are served, you're left staring at others stuffing themselves, while you sit there hungry.", "Agree - and if there is any question as to whether or not you may like the food, have something to eat beforehand", "I can't even fathom serving french fries for anyone at at party, but that's probably just me \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "There\u2019s a difference between being a vegetarian and having the palate of a toddler.  NTA.", "It sounds like to me that he didn\u2019t tell gf it was Asian themed and she got mad at him. Makes sense why she was so pleasant.", "This! Maria knew (or very well should have known) that the food was Asian. As Asian vegetarian options go, those dishes don't sound the least bit unusual or intimidating.   \n\n\nWhat does Maria normally eat? Oreos and French fries all day?", "My preschooler eats curry and eggplant.\n\nIf she's super picky, she needs to bring her own food.", "I suspect it was more Zach than Maria that had the issue.  Sounds like she was polite about it.", "> I\u2019d even go as far to say Maria should be apologising to you that she didn\u2019t eat much after you spent the time making two separate options primarily for her\n\nNo, that's too far, you can't expect people to apologise for simply not liking a food. She tried them and thanked the host, that's perfectly reasonable. Zach is the problem here, not Maria.", "Spinach is among the most protein-rich vegetables.", "I mean, that has its own issues. My kid cannot eat soy due to allergies and I can't have mushrooms due to allergies or beans because of ulcers. Most vegetarian food isn't appropriate for us. \n\nPotlucks are always a gamble.", "Why should they make everything vegan? Most people like meat in their food", "It was an Asian themed dinner though, and they knew that in advance. She never mentioned having a limited palette.

Definitely NTA", " Make the whole thing vegan and then everyone can eat everything.", "Made vegan desert for my daughter once and made the traditional recipe as well.  I set some of the vegan ones aside to make sure she got some.  Good thing too because everyone else loved the vegan option just as much as the original.", "Yeah, I think you might be right. I am willing to bet the GF wasn't mad at the couple that provided veggie dishes so much as she was at at her BF for not telling her what would be served.", "Agreed. Fries are not exactly the first thing I think of when I think \u201cvegetarian.\u201d This reminds me of my \u201cvegetarian\u201d cousin who really just eats pasta and won\u2019t touch most vegetables. Not so much vegetarian as no-meat-eating.  NTA", "Palak paneer? If so, you did just fine. It's both amazing and quite filling.", "You are making me even more hungry!", "Huh! I adore palak paneer, but I've never had... palak ricotta. Was it good?", "It would be easy to make 8 vegan dishes without those ingredients!

This makes perfect sense.", "Right! My husband was vegetarian up until about 8 years ago (only eats chicken now) and if we were going somewhere I would find out what was being served and if it wasn\u2019t anything he liked/could eat, we would stop somewhere on the way so he could eat something. \n\nShe likely felt similar to that, I\u2019m willing to bet.", "(vegetarian means no meat eating)", "Where? \n\nI\u2019ve never heard this. Mushrooms and jackfruit I\u2019ve seen offered as a meat substitute, but I\u2019ve yet to see eggplant offered that way.", "Well, it kinda does. Your body cannot store protein, so it's the only food group you need in every single meal. Your body must resort to breaking down it's own muscle tissue to keep going. Ofcourse no serious consequences if only once for a few hours, but not but you know those \"ugh, I cannot eat vegan, I just stay hungry\"-types? That's because they do not replace the protein, and their body still craves it. Their body is lacking nutrients.", "I know I have to work on myself, but I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019m not this entitled.", "Maybe! I just think the nature of dinner parties/potlucks/places where others make your food is always going to be uncertain and you have to roll with it. \n\nI would never dream of complaining. I'd eat plain rice and dip out early if need be.", "Why would anyone be missing out? There would be food for everyone.", "It definitely is. Like eggplant steaks and such.", "Eggplant parmesan is a pretty popular example of this.", "Well he wanted fries for his girlfriend,  they don't have protein either.", "Spinach is also a good source of plant protein. So she wasn't even without a protein offering for that one meal.", "It wouldn't. What would have improved the situation would be to provide the vegetarian with the same kind of choices as the meat eaters. Spinach curry and eggplant with miso are both dishes I'm not very fond of - I'll eat small portions of them to be nice but I'd rather fill up on something else.  Everyone else at the lunch party could choose between eight different dishes.   \n\n\nTBC, I do think a plus-one guest coming to a family lunch for the first time is being catered for adequately if there's something provided she *can* eat.  Would have been sensible of her to fill up beforehand, but she may have assumed there'd be more vegetarian dishes - \"Asian\" is a very wide range but includes loads of delicious vegetarian things. As I see it, though, it wasn't *her* who complained - it was her boyfriend Zach who did.", "Right! One invitee brings a +1 who has food restrictions. Let's *completely change the entire menu!!*   \ud83d\ude12", "Yeah I am the same way - it\u2019s just puzzling why you would put an ingredient in a majority of the dishes that you know a guest can\u2019t eat.", "Yeah but only vegan food.\n\nWhich means MISSING OUT on a huge range of tasty desirable dishes.", "Because most people like eating meat and no Vegan foods making it all vegan which is costly for ONE person is never a good idea unless that one person is the host", "Don't remind me I need to make that again soon. So damn good", "I don't quite follow your logic. Unless they made everything vegetarian only, omnis were always going to have more selection whether there's five dishes or fifty, because they can eat everything. If your complaint is that two dishes + rice isn't enough, I don't really agree - it's just one person, that seems pretty adequate. I think they did a pretty good job of being accommodating in this instance.", "This is actually an argument to just go ahead and make the whole event vegetarian. Assuming all other dietary needs are met this seems to be the most reasonable solution. Everyone can choose from all eight dishes."]}
