{"id": 19535, "submission_id": "146u1x2", "title": "AITA for cancelling an anniversary dinner with my wife, after she made several jokes about me?", "selftext": "For context, I (M33) have always been a bit of an introvert and a quiet person. My wife (F31), on the other hand, is the complete opposite. She is very extroverted and self-describes herself as an \"instigator.\" We've been together for 8 years (married for 4 of them).\n\nIn the past few months, one of my wife's very close friends (Anna, F31) has entered a relationship with a guy (Bob, M32). Given that Anna has had trouble finding someone for a long time, my wife is very happy for her and constantly tells me how great of a guy he is.\n\nI have met him a few times and think he's a great guy. I am very happy for him and Anna. That was until my wife started making constant comparisons between me and Bob over the past few weeks. For example, she'll say something along the lines of how we're in similar lines of work, yet he makes more money than me or how he manages to spend more time with Anna than I do with my wife.\n\nI've been kind of laughing it off for a while, but it has escalated to the point where she says things like how he dresses better than me, is in better shape than I am, and how he's more well-spoken than I am. I would like to add that she is well aware that I am somewhat insecure about how I talk, given that I have a slight lisp.\n\nLast night, which was the night before our 8-year anniversary dinner, my wife was on a group call with her friends, and they were talking about a fight that Bob and Anna had. After Anna had settled down, my wife said something along the lines of \"Sometimes you just have to compromise, for example, I had to settle for a guy who's a 3/10.\"\n\nI will admit, I was very angry at this comment and told my wife that her comments were unwarranted and it was embarrassing that she was telling people that's what she thought of me (even as a joke).\n\nWe started to argue, and my wife said that she was just trying to lighten the mood among her friends and that I was overreacting. She then mentioned how she can joke around like this because she's the most secure in our relationship compared to all her friends and their significant others, so it's her responsibility to make them feel good about their significant others.\n\nAt this point, I told her that I didn't care about the feelings of her \"stupid friends.\" I also said that I wasn't interested in an anniversary dinner, and I would not be going with her. The conversation ended there, and we have not spoken since. AITA?\n\nUpdate - My wife came to me this morning and apologized. She said that her comments were unwarranted and that she values our relationship greatly. She also described her own behavior and comments as disgusting.\n\nI would be lying if I said I wasn't still very angry, so I told my wife that her comments were disgusting, and in our 8 years together, I have never been so upset with her. I also told her that she alone caused this damage to our relationship and that she can't hide behind making her friends feel better. Lastly, I told her that I was not going to the anniversary dinner with her tonight, but she is free to go alone.\n\nI feel vindictive, and I know that she greatly values her friends seeing us as a stable couple. Without any pictures or videos of our anniversary dinner, I'm sure her friends will have plenty of questions for her.", "created_utc": 1686490356, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/146u1x2/aita_for_cancelling_an_anniversary_dinner_with_my/", "score": 2113, "replies": ["##[AITA for blocking your go-to time killer from June 12-14?](https://redd.it/145o4jz)\n\nWelcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My wife (F31), on the other hand, is the complete opposite. She is very extroverted and self-describes herself as an \"instigator.\" We've been together for 8 years (married for 4 of them).\n\nIn the past few months, one of my wife's very close friends (Anna, F31) has entered a relationship with a guy (Bob, M32). Given that Anna has had trouble finding someone for a long time, my wife is very happy for her and constantly tells me how great of a guy he is.\n\nI have met him a few times and think he's a great guy. I am very happy for him and Anna. That was until my wife started making constant comparisons between me and Bob over the past few weeks. For example, she'll say something along the lines of how we're in similar lines of work, yet he makes more money than me or how he manages to spend more time with Anna than I do with my wife.\n\nI've been kind of laughing it off for a while, but it has escalated to the point where she says things like how he dresses better than me, is in better shape than I am, and how he's more well-spoken than I am. I would like to add that she is well aware that I am somewhat insecure about how I talk, given that I have a slight lisp.\n\nLast night, which was the night before our 8-year anniversary dinner, my wife was on a group call with her friends, and they were talking about a fight that Bob and Anna had. After Anna had settled down, my wife said something along the lines of \"Sometimes you just have to compromise, for example, I had to settle for a guy who's a 3/10.\"\n\nI will admit, I was very angry at this comment and told my wife that her comments were unwarranted and it was embarrassing that she was telling people that's what she thought of me (even as a joke).\n\nWe started to argue, and my wife said that she was just trying to lighten the mood among her friends and that I was overreacting. She then mentioned how she can joke around like this because she's the most secure in our relationship compared to all her friends and their significant others, so it's her responsibility to make them feel good about their significant others.\n\nAt this point, I told her that I didn't care about the feelings of her \"stupid friends.\" I also said that I wasn't interested in an anniversary dinner, and I would not be going with her. The conversation ended there, and we have not spoken since. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The things your wife said are mean, and \u201cjoking\u201d doesn\u2019t make them any less mean - it just means she laughs while being cruel.\n\nI\u2019m glad she apologized, but did she apologize because she\u2019s actually sorry or because she\u2019s worried about the dinner?", "NTA\n\nF- that, who rates someone? And the comparisons?  As if humans don't beat themselves up enough internally. I guarantee if the situation was reverse everyone would be telling her to leave you. I wouldn't let her off easy at all.

I would have a very hard time staying with someone who constantly negs me like that.", "NTA but I would weigh your options here. It sounds like your wife apologized.

What your wife has been doing and then this \"settling, 3/10\" comment is not what a loving wife does. No excuse whatsoever. It shows a total lack of respect for you.

Who does that?\n\nI'm not sure I could come back from this, but if I wanted to try, I would want some firm expectations about her actions and some IC counseling for her. I say IC not MC because she's the one with the issue and needs to work on herself before you can deal with the two of you as a couple.\n\nAlso, maybe limiting time with said friends because they aren't helping the situation. She needs to do some heavy work to repair the damage. That means you and your marriage should be her focus not the friends.

I'd talk about how sweet he is to my friend and how in love they are, about all the nice things he does for her, which is exactly how my bf treats me! I talk about how nice it is to see her with someone that cares the way my bf cares about me.\n\nI NEVER put my boyfriend down and remind him regularly that he is the best thing that's ever happened to me, even if his own insecurities tell him he isn't.

They all started bailing when they realized that he'd \"instigate\" on them.\n\nIt's not her job to make her friends feel better in their relationships (it's theirs) by tearing you down.

It\u2019s its own, specific thing/occurence. A horrible thing. Its useful for it to have its own word, so victims can recognise themselves in the description, and can name it when it happens.)", "Yes! Petty vibes here \ud83d\ude02", "I don\u2019t think having kids should matter, children should see positive role models for their future relationships. There\u2019s lots of parents who should get divorced because their kids see how toxic the relationship is and are being conditioned to think it\u2019s normal.", "Seriously. My husband and I have been married for over 20 years now and I can't imagine ever wanting to insult him to other people, especially if those other people are having trouble with their relationship. Maybe it's just me, but when I see girlfriends unhappy or mistreated in their relationships, I tend to point out that it doesn't have to be that way, that my husband and I have never mistreated each other. I definitely don't go telling them that it could be worse, and lie about my husband in an attempt to make him look worse than my friend's partner. If anything, I feel a little guilty talking to GFs who are having trouble with their partners, bc I know I can't help being fulfilled in my relationship, and wonder if I am unintentionally rubbing my happiness in their faces.", "It doesn't even sound like she's insecure about herself as she said she's the most secure person there. I think she is just insecure on the behalf of OP.", "What did Bob do?", "Do you believe her comment was made in jest?", "the bob comment made me laugh", ">However rather than accept her apology and \u201ckiss and makeup\u201d, you kept calling her out and inflaming the situation.\n\nYou watch too much TV.

We've got our fair share of problems like any couple, but I would never demean him to my friends, let alone say I'd settled (and 3/10? Seriously?). He has major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder as it is, though it's managed by medication. I make sure to help build him up, be his cheerleader. This woman sounds unhappy and is taking it out on her husband. \n\nOP, you're NTA. I wouldn't want to celebrate an anniversary with someone who treats me with such contempt either. If you're going to stay in his marriage, I think you need to insist on couples counseling.", "Exactly. She's secure, meaning she's confident enough to take OP for granted and insult him.", "My husband, rest his soul, used to call it \u201cjokingly serious\u201d.", "Exactly this! It\u2019s kinda fucked up that op\u2019s wife\u2019s first thought to make her friend\u2019s partner to feel welcomed is to demean her own husband???? Like??? She could\u2019ve just complimented both of them, or fondly roasted both, not hit OP where it hurts. Op is NTA.", "NTA. She wasn\u2019t even doing it behind his back but openly for him to hear. Hopefully her apology was sincere but she has to prove that for awhile to regain his trust.", "I\u2019m stunned someone would proudly call themselves an instigator.

Those are the ones I runaway from.", ">\u201cI\u2019m very loyal.\u201d\n\nI used to play poker with a man who constantly banged on about loyalty, to the point where me and a couple of the other players who weren't social with him outside the poker game would call him \"Loyal Chris\" amongst ourselves to differentiate him from a different Chris. Anyway, low and behold, it turned out that he was cheating on his wife with his brother's girlfriend.", "This is spot on.", ">\u2026but describing yourself as an instigator? That\u2019s not even attempting to spin it at something positive. I have never heard that one.\n\nLucky you. I have heard this from my sister-in-law more than a few times, except how she says it is *it's my job to bring chaos into the world,* as if it is a good thing.\n\nYou have a really great point. When anyone says *well, I'm just X* what they often mean is, *yeah I have these issues but I have no intention of dealing with them, take it or leave it.* And I choose \"leave it\" every time. :-) Another one... I had a work colleague who used to say, *my* *wife tells me I'm high maintenance but that I'm worth it.* Amazingly they are still married.

It's not amusing to make jokes about people you care about. She treats you with a lot of disdain, so perhaps some introspection is in order. Whether she learns to provide the support you need or you discover someone who will, you deserve someone who will raise you up.", "Yep, contempt is usually the death knell for a relationship.

She's crossed the line by displaying the latter here.

Don't stay together for the kids, because you're showing them it's okay to stay in a dysfunctional relationship and accept abuse for the sake of appearances.", "Yeah I will never understand partners talking to each other like that it\u2019s so disrespectful and damaging", "Yeah that's her being insecure about herself.

Hype up only.", "How about the fact that she\u2019s more worried about their \u201cimage\u201d then she is the fact she broke her husband\u2019s heart.

I'm really, really sorry she's speaking about you like that.", "My first thought was she apologized so she would get the dinner.", "She shouldn't have his trust back.
