I\u2019m an HR professional. It sounds like Alice had a normal amount of time off and you have actually spoken to Alice directly about the possible concern. It\u2019s not unreasonable to expect her to work as normal if she said she can. If she can\u2019t, that\u2019s ok but it\u2019s up to her to express that and ask for accommodations. It sounds like the coworker is making assumptions and hasn\u2019t talked to Alice directly about it. Alice is an adult and it\u2019s her responsibility to advocate for herself. If you\u2019re ok with your HR dept, you may want to get ahead of it and bring it up to them first just so they\u2019re not hearing the other coworker\u2019s version of things first. But I get some HR depts aren\u2019t great\u2026\n\nYou may want to send a follow up email to Alice regarding your conversation to cover your own ass. Documentation is your friend.", "NTA, and document your conversation with Alice if there is an issue reported. And if this other manager is not in your direct reporting, she has crossed a line into your business.\n\nThis should be brought immediately to YOUR own manager and advise exactly your steps and documentation that you already discussed with Alice.", "Go to HR yourself.", "NTA\n\nBut honestly OP I would just go to HR, lay it all out on the table and see what they say. In my opinion you\u2019ve done exactly the right thing and really the higher ups are in the wrong but you need to be seen doing this all by the book for yours and Alice\u2019s sake.", "NTA.  \n\nDocument your conversations with Alice.  Do them over email.  Make it clear there is no repercussions.  IE:  'Alice, I want to make sure you understand that, due to your family situation, we can reduce your workload for a while if you desire.  Switching to this lighter workload will not impact your compensation or your prospects for advancement or promotion within the company in any way whatever; there will be no negative impacts to this decision in any way.  I am pleased to offer this and it is a genuine offer that you are welcome to accept.  Please let me know what you decide.'  \nShe will reply no.  \nReply to that that you understand, and want her to know that she is welcome to change her mind at any time without penalty.  \n\nThen take that along with any communications with the female higher up to HR.  Complain that someone outside your chain of command is trying to give you orders, and that you have taken every possible step to offer a lighter workload to the new mother, but she has made her choice with no coercion from you.  Bonus points if you offer them a work assignment plan that reduces the new mom's workload but keeps workload on the rest of your team at manageable levels.", "NTA because interestingly enough I know a lot of women who complained they go back to work and they didn\u2019t have any projects anymore. They had nothing and we\u2019re left out", "NTA and you are trying to protect Alice's wishes and her career. Just keep giving her the option of a lighter workload, and make the decision yourself if you see her work quality slip. The higher up is actually the one making discriminatory assumptions here which could impact Alice negatively.", "NTA. Sounds like it's time for a meeting with HR, Alice and the higher up female that keeps making this an issue. You shouldn't be getting harassed for doing exactly as Alice wishes.", "NTA, but I would take this to HR yourself. You can lay out the discussions you've had with Alice. They can talk with her themselves if they like. If there's any issue you can get it sorted preemptively.\n\nThe best defense can sometimes be a good offense. Take it to HR yourself and get their input. Once you have clear direction from them, the other person sticking their nose in can kick rocks. Don't wait for them to escalate this. Be proactive.", "NTA.  You should take this to HR first about being harassed by this other manager and give your past reasoning and discussions with Alice on the topic.  From there let HR talk to Alice directly and when they hear from her that this is what she wants then they can shut down this busy body higher up manager for getting their nose where it clearly does not belong.", "NTA. Alice will let you know, if she's finding it difficult to cope. She had a baby, she didn't suddenly become disabled.", "I think it's time to document everything and to report your manager who is pressuring you as being sexist. I understand having a child is difficult for BOTH parents, I don't see requiring less work from either as acceptable. Even moreso because your report is asking for the same work as previously. Why would it be fair for a childless person to pick up the slack for either parent unless they were compensated for doing more work.", "NTA!! Go to HR first and make sure you get your side in before the others can twist the truth.. Corporate life as you know can be petty abs you need to be prepare. Also cc emails to make sure you have back up of what\u2019s happening.. maybe arrange an HR meeting with Alice and Hr.", "nta, she asked for the same workload, and is fine w/ it. tell your higher ups to talk to her if they're so concerned. $5 she'll tell them the same thing", "NTA other higher up person has a chip on her shoulder and wants to bring in some sexism mess that she can probably use to champion herself to others about.\n\nEspecially if she maintains it after multiple talks.", "NTA - Why is she involving herself in your management decisions if she's not even your manager?  I'd tell her to take it up with your boss if she has issues with your work.", "This is difficuly, but ultimately, I have to go with NTA.\nThe higher up is right that Alice may feel intimidated about speaking up. But it's wrong to assume a woman can't do certain jobs because she is a mother and just gave birth. It's an assumption women often face. It has led to some being afraid to have babies because they are afraid their employers will think they are less loyal or less able.\n\nGranted childbirth takes a toll on the body, and that's not something a cis male would experience, but I wonder if the higher up would have the same concerns about a new father being given too much work. Or if they would assume the mother would take care of the childrearing.\n\nI think what you're doing is the best possible course of action.", "NTA. \n\nYou are being rational and professional, and dealing with Alice straightforwardly. You are giving Alice agency in the decision and not making presumptions. \n\nThe person from HR is effectively patronising Alice and not allowing her to be involved in the decision about her own workload. \n\nMaybe the next step is to arrange for Alice to speak directly to HR?", "NTA. The higher-up wants you to discriminate against Alice on the basis of sex and family status, potentially impacting her career. If Alice asks for accommodations, that would be one thing. You\u2019ve done the right thing by opening the door to that, if she wants. But unilaterally changing her work because she is a new mom is discriminatory, wrong, and illegal. Go to HR first, and tell them you\u2019re being pressured by the higher up discriminate against one of your reports.", "NTA I would talk with your manager. Give them a heads up and get their opinion.", "NTA and your higher up is only going to make HR problems for herself if she pursues this course of action because it comes off as penalizing Alice for becoming a mother.", "Sorry, but HR  isn't going to do shit unless you have the higher-ups complaints in writing. I think you should have a meeting with all parties and ask the mom again in front of them what she wants and outline what the plan is. \n\nNta", "NTA - You have talked to Alice and let her know if she couldn't handle it let you know. Then you spoke to her again and she told you she's good with the workload. Sounds to me like manager needs to mind her own business. Maybe go to HR about the manager harassing you for you an issue that isn't an issue?", "NTA- document everything including written proof that Alice is completely okay with the workload she has and \u201cthis female\u201d who\u2019s higher up is creating a hostile work environment and Ignoring Alice\u2019s judgement.", "NTA go and talk to HR about it as soon as possible. The higher up shouldn't be trying to coerce you into this but you should absolutely be clear with company policy and the ones to clear that up are HR.", "NTA\n\nYou have had meetings with this person to make sure the workload they have is manageable. They've told you yes. You're just going forward with the information you were given.", "NTA. Can you organize a meeting with three of you so that your higher up can listen to Alice directly?", "NTA. If she\u2019s able to do the work and hasn\u2019t objected, there\u2019s no need to paternalistically force her to cut back.", "NTA.\n\nAlice herself made this decision. She would\u2019ve gotten accommodations if she needed/wanted them, but she *clearly* didn\u2019t.\n\nForcing a new mom to work less than she desires isn\u2019t better than forcing her to work more. You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA.\n\nOther person is being gross.\n\nIf ALICE had asked, then it would have been good to consider. But Alice is happy and it's an insult to her for other person to assume she can't.", "NTA.\n\nHow is your HR dept? if they're on eof the good ones, it would be best to go to them yourself and inform them of the situation, voicing your concerns that giving in to the higher up's pressure would be unduly and unnecessarily jeopardizing Alice's career progress.", "NTA\n\nI would speak to HR about this. Alice has a right to be believed if her workload is fine for her post-pregnancy situation.", "NTA. Let the higher up take it to HR. And when Alice tells them she's fine, watch the higher up get knocked down a peg or two.", "INFO: Is there an actual company policy regarding giving new parents a lighter workload?  Is this policy just for new mothers, or equally new mothers and fathers?", "Info: why does a different team\u2019s manager/exec have any say about one of your reports? What does your direct supervisor have to say? Why would someone coming back from maternity leave have projects taken away from them? There seems to be a lot of missing pieces here.\n\nIt definitely sucks that her leave is so short, but she isn\u2019t asking for a different/easier \u201cpath\u201d. Coming back from maternity leave is really hard, but some times throwing yourself into work or a work project makes it easier to adjust (for me it did at least).", "NTA. You handled this properly as a manager by having multiple direct discussions with your report about how she wants to handle coming back. Presumably, if she were to come to you in the next few weeks or months and tell you she's struggling and overloaded, you would work with her to help balance her workload. Other manager needs to butt out and let you manage your team.", "NTA but you need to cover your ass yesterday because you're about to be thrown in a fire by this higher-up and the company won't rescue you.\n\nGo to HR first and tell them this higher-up is trying to discriminate against an employee who just gave birth by pulling her from projects and career opportunities.", "NTA. \n\nAlice might feel coerced into taking back on more than she should, or she might also be telling the truth when she says she's ready to perform to her previous standards, and taking projects away from Alice could be unfairly detrimental to Alice's career. \n\nIt's generally best to follow Alice's lead, and to follow the evidence of her performance, rather than following the lead of some woman from a different group whose only connection with Alice is to share the same kind of reproductive system.", "Based off of this post, NTA.  The specifics are a little vague in terms of your field and what the expectations (not specific tasks, but time-wise) on this new mom are.  I assume, given the quick return to work this is likely the US.  The paid parental leave here is a damn shame and I will say, as a mother of a 2 year old, the first 8-10 months back at work (I was back after 5.5 weeks with zero paid leave, after a C section, and I work for the government...man, we suck), I had some difficulty concentrating and I would have liked more (or some) paid leave.  But that's not the issue here.  Alice is doing her work to an adequate level.  You asked her if she wanted a lighter load, she said no.  End of story.  You should perhaps, in an email, so you have it in writing, let her know that she should reach out to you if she, at any time, feels she needs an accommodation relating to any issues (not sure if she is pumping or chest feeding, etc, but I assume she has accommodations for that IF she is) or in the event she needs to go to doctors appointments or anything for her baby.  And reiterate to her in person that if she feels she needs any assistance/a lighter load at any point, to let you know.  It sounds like you're a good boss, looking out for her, so keep it up.  Let the senior person report you to HR and then when they do an investigation you can make it clear that you do not want Alice to feel in any way that she is being penalized for having a baby AND that you've made her aware you will assist her in any accommodations she needs.", "NTA You gave her a choice when she came back. After some pressure from another manager, you again asked her and she was emphatically clear being okay with the workload. There is no discriminatory behaviour here.   \n\n\nHowever, if I may, do you have anything confirming this in writing/email with her? Always cover your ass just in case!", "NTA. I think you\u2019re handling this situation accordingly and communicating with your employee is part of your process. I commend you for that and not ignoring her wishes. I get your higher up\u2019s concern, but communication with your manager as well should be important. I suggest having a meeting regarding expectations for your employee with your manager in the room. Giving her the option to drop projects if it gets overwhelming might be a good idea. Creating a supportive environment for this new mom will be something she appreciates. Taking projects away from her would be considered discrimination imo. If everything is communicated and that higher up makes an HR case against you, you have your employee and manager to back you up.", "If Alice isn't saying anything NTA", "Huge NTA. You have made yourself aware of potential issues facing new moms returning to the workforce and communicated several times with your employee, who has stated she is happy with her workload. You would be TA to bend to pressure from this other manager. I think it would be prudent to email HR yourself to loop them in before this other manager makes an big issue out of a non-issue.", "Alive is ok with the workload assigned to her by you, her supervisor. Unless there is a documented concern with her performance on her assigned workload, there is no reason to adjust it. Why take work away from someone who is meeting expectations and is ok with her worload?\n\nIf the manager who is questioning Alice's workload is not in your line of reporting, why is she involving herself in your team? \n\nIs it possible that Alice has spoken to her in a way that she may not be comfortable approaching you?

They will shut that shit down for you.

If you have not seen evidence of a drop in quality, make sure to add that you are being asked to do this without evidence the employees performance is suffering", "I was honestly ready to call you the AH but you are not the AH in this case your management absolutely is.  They are probably worried about liability and by being overly worried about liability they are actually discriminating against her for just having had birth.
