It's still a massive shock to me, no one expected this to happen.\n\nHer funeral is next week. There's going to be quite a few people attending, we're a big family.\n\nMy sister Dani f26, invited my ex boyfriend Mikey m23 to our mom's funeral and I'm really not okay with this.\n\nMikey and I met at school and were friends since we were 15. We started dating when we were 19 and were together for 1 year. \n\nWe impulsively moved in together into a homeshare. It was appealing to me as my family home was incredibly crowded (I have 6 siblings who were all living there).\n\nOur relationship went downhill a few months in as Mikey became an addict. I soley paid our rent as Mikey never had any money and would constantly try to steal mine. My only regret was that I hadn't left him sooner, every single time I'd try, he'd crank up the waterworks and fill my head with promises that he'd go to rehab and be better.\n\nWhen we inevitibly got evicted as the house turned into a drug den, something in me kind of snapped and I left Mikey, and I went to go stay with a friend. Mikey tried to go back to his parents but they kicked him out.\n\nMy mom allowed Mikey to stay with her. He went to rehab and group therapy and got a new job, but after staying with her and taking advantage of her kindness for around a year, he randomly disappeared and had stolen a load of cash from my mom's purse and even one of my younger sibling's piggy banks.\n\nLast year, Mikey contacted my mom on Facebook and he sent her a very long essay, apologizing for his actions. My mom forgave him but kept him at arms-length.\n\nNow that the funeral is arranged, Dani reached out to Mikey and asked him to come to the funeral. She never mentioned this to me until she had already invited him. I haven't seen Mikey in years and I really don't want him coming to the funeral, having my ex boyfriend there is the last thing I need. Dani says it's what our mom would've wanted and that he did live under her roof for a while and was almost like part of the family. I disagree, family members don't do the kinds of things he did and he doesn't deserve to attend.\n\nMy other siblings agree with me and don't want Mikey attending, and one of my brothers even suspects Dani has a crush on Mikey because this is really bizarre behavior from her.\n\nIt's caused a rift between Dani and I as she thinks I'm clinging onto the past. I ended up blowing up at her because she called me bitter and said I need to \"let the little things go\". I called her delusional and said that she's ruining our mom's funeral.\n\nAm I really the asshole?", "created_utc": 1695000789, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16li85a/aita_my_sister_has_invited_my_ex_boyfriend_to_our/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She's made grieving more difficukt than it needs to be right now. Tell him NOT to come and move on the best you can.", "NTA\n\nIf you can talk to him, ask him to stay away.  This isn't that time or place.  If he is truly sorry and honestly in recovery for his actions, he will understand.  If he isn't, he will show up, because it is about him.", "NTA\u2026. So sorry for your loss. You do not need this extra stress on top of what you are already dealing with. Hopefully someone will reach out to your ex and tell him not to come.", "I'm sorry for your loss.\n\nI don't really know if I'm on Y T A or N A H , you have to remember your sister lost your mother to\nyou are both hurting and everything is much harder right now. \n\nit sounds like he maybe became more than just your ex to your mother,  someone she cared for to,  even after everything he  put you and her through. \nnot sure it is fair to think this is your decision. \n\nyour sister might know something you don't,  talked about stuff with your mom,  that you and your mom didn't talk about. \n\nthis is not just about you and your feelings,  but it is not all about your sisters either,  I really think you should try and have a conversation about this with your sister,  ask why this is important to her. \n\nI guess I'm on NAH again I'm sorry for your loss", "I'm sorry for your loss.  I lost my father suddenly a few years ago, and it was very difficult to process.  \nI'm kind of undecided about the answer  - I feel a bit like neither of you are the AH, (you or your sister), but it's definitely a very difficult situation.  My thoughts are a) family members absolutely do things like (your ex did) to each other; and b) if he had found out independantly (I know he didn't, but in theory he could have), he could totally have turned up without being invited, and unless it's on private property, with a bouncer, you probably couldn't keep him out anyway.  \nSo, all I can say is don't be an AH to yourself.  Let yourself focus on your mother, and the funeral.  To that end, if your sister has invited him, then it's on her to settle this thing down by telling him that if he must attend to pay respects to your mother, then you do not want to see or speak to him. Say that to him directly beforehand if you feel that's possible (via message or email or some such), but don't engage in any other way.  If he tries, tell him you're focussing on your mother, and now is not the time.  I know that's not what you want, but I feel like trying to chance your sister's mind is only going to take your energy away from your mother, and whil eit completelt sucks (and I agree it does), it's pretty much out of your control.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Sounds like your sister is neither going to change her mind, nor do anything to support your (justified) situation, so if she doesn't like you having an person present to divert him from you, then she'll just have to deal."]}
