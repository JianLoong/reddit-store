Here's what happened:\n\nA few days ago, my friend invited me over to his place for a small gathering with a few other friends. We were having a great time, but things took a turn for the worse when I accidentally knocked over a valuable antique vase that belonged to my friend's family. It shattered into pieces, and I could tell it was something of great sentimental value to him.\n\nNow, here's where the conflict arises. I immediately apologized profusely and acknowledged my mistake. My friend was understandably upset and demanded that I reimburse him for the vase, which he estimated to be worth a substantial amount of money. While I do feel bad about what happened, I flat out refused to pay him anything.\n\nMy reasoning behind this decision is that accidents happen, and I believe it's unfair for him to ask me to cover the entire cost of the vase. I argued that it was his responsibility to safeguard his valuable possessions, especially during a gathering where accidents are more likely to occur. I also mentioned that I couldn't afford to pay such a significant amount.\n\nSince then, our friendship has been strained, and some of our mutual friends are telling me that I'm being unreasonable and that I should take responsibility for my actions. They believe I should reimburse him fully or at least offer to contribute toward the cost of the vase. However, I still feel like I'm not in the wrong here.\n\nSo, AITA, I need your judgment. Am I the asshole for refusing to pay my friend back for the antique vase that I accidentally broke? Should I reconsider my stance and try to make amends? I'm open to hearing your perspectives on this situation.\n\n**TL;DR:** Accidentally broke my friend's valuable antique vase during a gathering, but I refused to pay for it because I believe accidents happen and he should have taken better care of his belongings. Now our friendship is strained, and I'm wondering if I'm the asshole in this situation.\n\n**Update:** I forgot to mention the cost of the vase, friend told me it is around 3k - 4k USD\n\n**Update 2:** lots of people are asking me for more details on where the vase was, how i knocked it over and such. Basically, the vase was on top of this very tall cupboard in the living room, we were all drinking, some drunker than others, I was just tipsy, and i was chatting with another friend next to the cupboard, and I wanted to kinda lean into it and stuff, but I sort of slipped and instead ended up straight up bumping into it, afterwards the vase just falls, and breaks... I had no idea it was up there or how much it was worth, friend never mentioned it until it broke and my fuck up happened.\n\n**HUGE UPDATE:** Most of you suggested waiting a few days for both of us to cool down before I contact him, I failed to do that, and most of you said i should ask for proof of the value.\n\nSo I did, i asked him to provide proof, he instead got really defensive and deflective saying shit like \"You don't trust me? I am your best friend, and you ask for proof?\" and anytime I would return to asking for proof he would always just comment like that, never gave me a no or yes.\n\nSo I let it go, and spoke to my brother, he suggested that truly the best way to find out if he is legit, is to ask someone from his family, supposedly the people who this vase is really important to.\n\nAnd oh boy.....oh fucking boy. I contacted his brother, and said \"Hey, you know that vase your family passed to X?\"\n\nHis reply \"What? Lmao what you on about\"\n\nSo I told him what happened, about my accident, and that I know they really care about it, but does he know if the family ever insured the vase and how much it is truly worth\n\n\"I have no idea what you are talking about, We don't have a vase, we don't even have any heirlooms, not our families thing..\"\n\nWell....... Now i am kind of really pissed at my friend for trying to do that to me.\n\nNo idea if it's actually an expensive vase, my friend is quite wealthy so he could have gotten it for a big price, but considering he lied about it belonging to the family and having sentimental value to all of them. I highly doubt it.\n\n**Update 4:** I have taken all of your comments close to heart, and I realize that I am indeed a huge AH for flat out refusing to do a thing to fix the damage i did, and instead i shifted the blame on him, I am not a good friend at all, and thank you all for pointing that out :/\n\nI am going to wait a little bit to let him cooldown, in the meanwhile i will check and find out where i could get a loan, and then when he is ready to talk and calm, I will do my best to pay back as best as I can, from his reaction it'S clear that even if he did lie, that vase meant alot to him.\n\nI will ask him about the lie, i am sure it's harmless, and then try to mend things, I don't want to lose a best friend over my selfishness and a fking vase", "created_utc": 1686235718, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/144bagf/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_my_friend_back_after/", "score": 138, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Are there documents saying it was worth that much or are you taking his word for it? Did he have it insured since it's so valuable or is it just sentimental? I agree there are consequences but I also don't think you should allow yourself to be taken advantage of. Do some research and start asking questions. Guy might of bought it from a thrift store and set it up to be broken because he needs money. Only you know the truth of all of these so being the AH is to be determined.
