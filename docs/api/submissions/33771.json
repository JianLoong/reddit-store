There was a tense family moment after someone passed where FIL said something awful, I responded saying something along the lines about not saying things like that, FIL told me to shut up and came at me. Husband stepped in with a sharp object and stopped his dad. I pulled him away and said I will never see you again and we left. Tbh I still hate thinking about it. To my husband and his dad this was a fairly normal interaction and they have both gotten over it completely.
