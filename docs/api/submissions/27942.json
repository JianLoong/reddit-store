She's your sister. I feel like a sibling doing this is different to some random person you know.\n\n2. *You* provided her with a code that she could use, and then didn't remove it. I don't think it's unreasonable that she may not have realised you weren't okay with her coming in considering you *intentionally gave her a code to your house* and you know each other very well. If you didn't set the boundary, I can see how she could have misinterpreted what was going on, especially considering you're literally siblings. And if it was that much of a problem, you should have removed it.\n\nEqually, I do personally think that her making the assumption she could come in was silly and careless, but I do still recognise the room for potential misunderstanding.", "YTA\n\nmy gawd, that was a Huge overreaction for your sister coming over(who lives down the street).\n\nLots of family members walk into others homes without knocking.  \n\nIt feels like you have not specifically stated your boundary before.

(Bordering very slightly on YTA) If this was the first time she\u2019s done that, I don\u2019t think she did anything wrong. Now she knows your boundaries and it shouldn\u2019t happen again. I don\u2019t know exactly how drastically you yelled at her, but it sounds like you definitely overreacted. Could\u2019ve just been the initial fear scream then \u201cOh my god it\u2019s just you. Don\u2019t do that. Knock or text me before coming over.\u201d", "YTA for screaming, yes.\n\nThere is a lot of missing context here, tbh. You haven't said if this is something that has happened beyond pet sitting. You haven't given insight to the closeness of your relationship with your sister. You also never said whether your sister tried to ring the doorbell or knock before letting herself in. You haven't said if this was a violated boundary previously set by you in the past (i.e. you explicitly stating that your family cannot let themselves into your home with the code outside of them doing you a favor or having direct permission).\n\nDue to the missing context, I can only assume that you are the AH. You got scared and instead of controlling your emotional reaction, you unreasonably attacked your sister for doing something comparably normal in a close-knit family. Instead of having a reasonable reaction such as reacting in fear to a surprising event, calming down once you realize it is someone you know, and from then on setting a boundary requesting that they please call ahead to avoid scaring you in the future (and to avoid the feeling of violation of your private sanctum). \n\nThis isn't your sister walking into \"someone's house\" unannounced. This is your sister walking into a family member's house unannounced using a previously issued key that seemed to have no boundaries set prior to its use.\n\nFor context, my sister gave me her house key when she first moved out and explicitly told me to make myself at home, but to be careful not to let the dog out. Of course, out of courtesy, I always reached out prior. But she previously established her preference for entrance to her home and I respected it (her dog never got out on my watch). \n\nYou should apologize. You did overreact.", "Is there a kinda the asshole option? You had every reason to be upset but you cant just scream at a person and expect it to go well.

Actually ill just remove the code as that's easier\" Or whatever it is you wanted to say, but with a more level head.\n\nAgain, even if you're right, screamin' is wrong.", "ESH\n\nYou set yourself up by letting family have the code to your door.

Like, I literally knock on my Mom's door, enter, and say, \"Knock-knock!\" I know it's silly, but I want to make sure she knows it's me.", "NTA, for sure. Maybe there is the perception that you've sent mixed signals to your family, but they should definitely knock when they come over.", "No assholes here.  You're certainly not the ah for your reaction but there are also absolutely people who would have no problem with what your sister did.\n\nIf you had a connotation that it was not a reasonable mistake then you might owe an apology for that part, but that would be about it.  Expectations just weren't set well and a miscommunication ensued.\n\nIt's your house, there is no problem with telling your sister she needs to leave and needs to make sure it's ok to come in, though it probably would have been best to give her the paper.\n\nIn the future, always make sure to set expectations when giving someone keys or codes.

Was the local store out of office supplies? I think she may have been trying to steal.", "NTA - I, personally, would apologize for yelling, but make it clear that code or not, it's impolite to come in without asking. My mom made a copy of my house key one time, saying it was for emergencies in case I got locked out, but then came in without asking and flaunted it, so we changed the locks. She was so mad, but I pointed out that she proved she wasn't responsible enough to have the key. \n\nYour sister needs to learn how to be responsible.", "For OP's safety I would probably suggest that if they can't hear someone entering the premises they should find a different solution to their listening devices? What if it was a stranger with ill intent? Still not ok for sister to just let herself in, but she might have knocked and not been heard. And then decided to just let herself in, which is a bit of a questionable choice.", "What's funny is, the one time it happened to me I was super calm. I once woke up at 4 am when a stranger walked into my apartment. I hadn't left the door unlocked, she had a key. I had a little jolt, but immediately somehow knew I wasn't in danger. Turned out it was a guest of the man in the apartment directly below me who had gone out for a smoke, then got the wrong floor when she came back in. And her key fit my door because MY ASSHOLE OF A LANDLORD had installed half of a set if locks on my door and half on the one downstairs.

If someone had the guts to break into an apartment I wonder if some screaming would just do something.", "It is office which is a professional space, but entering someone's home without informing them that is invading there PRIVATE space. \n\nHonesty if it happened to me I would do more than scream.\n\nThe code/key is given in case of emergency. Needing a piece of paper does not constitute that.", "Thing is it wasn't an intentional home invasion.  Some people are much more open door with family and if expectations weren't clearly set, miscommunication can happen.  \n\nDoesn't mean anything the op did was wrong, but doesn't mean anything ops sister did was wrong either.

There are people who can control their dreams. \"Lucid dreaming,\" they call it. I wonder if it's possible that the recurring nightmare is actually you controlling the dream but being unaware of it.\n\nHave you seen a counselor about the nightmares?

Here's clarification for anyone in Florida who may find themselves in this situation and might do that, because in the moment they *thought* they had known the law, but actually read misinformation spread by irresponsible, clueless IDIOTS.\n\nFlorida Stand Your Ground Law Explained\nFlorida\u2019s current stand your ground law protects you from prosecution for homicide if you can prove that you believed you or another person was in imminent danger of bodily harm or death or that you used deadly force to prevent the commission of a felony.Alternatively, if you can show that you acted within the principles of the stand your ground statute, which outlines the circumstances under which someone could reasonably conclude they were in imminent danger, you can be protected from prosecution.It\u2019s important to note that the stand your ground law and castle doctrine statutes do not apply in all situations in which someone is threatened by death or bodily harm.\n\nJustifiable homicide in self-defense is not permitted in situations where:\n-Persons are on premises unlawfully or are engaged in criminal activity. -Someone is attempting to commit a forcible felony.\n-Someone is escaping the premises after committing a forcible felony. -The defendant intentionally provoked the other party, leading to a confrontation. -THE OTHER PARTY ATTEMPTED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE SITUATION OR LEAVE THE PREMISES  -In rare cases, someone engaged in criminal activity may claim self-defense, such as if they were trying to leave and the initial victim escalated the situation. Still, these cases may require a significant burden of proof for self-defense.\n\nWhat Are the Key Provisions of Florida\u2019s Stand Your Ground Law?\nYour lawyer will need to demonstrate that you were lawfully permitted to be where the event occurred, that you reasonably believed you were in danger, and THAT THE OTHER PARTY DID NOT TRY TO DE-ESCALATE OR RETREAT FROM THE SITUATION.\n\n\n[Source](https://www.thedensonfirm.com/criminal-defense/stand-your-ground-law-in-florida-explained/)", "This is how people get shot for, say, parking in front of somebody's house while they check directions on their phone.", "After my mother in law decided to dig up the rocks in our front flower beds without asking while we were at work (before we had even moved in to the house or made plans for the damn flower beds), she\u2019s never getting a key to any home I live in or allowed to roam around unattended.", "No, we had A4 paper in the 80s.", "EU =/= \"the whole world\"", "And some countries in Central and South America", "Also how people defend their houses from criminal turds.

That makes *you* a criminal. Your property does not justify committing murder - and honestly, your house doesn't need defending.

I am NOT going to allow a stranger with unknown motives who enters my house by force to remain standing. Period.", "If it was just my property I'd agree. Problem is the people who live on it are in danger too possibly. Someone wandering around outside or just sitting outside, not a threat possibly. Someone trespassing inside, all bets are off. Thank fuck someone with a stupid opinion like yours can't get rid of SYG laws. Also, if you value my property more than your life, why wouldn't I do the same? Lethal force is not a first option for everything, but it is not murder to not give someone free reign of your house. Please try telling someone who's actually had run ins with violent criminal turds that defending themselves was murder."]}
