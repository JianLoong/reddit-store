Boundaries are important and everyone or anyone should call or text before coming over even though they have a code, that\u2019s just common decency.  Your mother being involved is bananas to me.", "ESH.\n\nTitle is misleading BTW, your sister did not lock herself in your apartment. \n\nYour sister shouldn't have walked in without knocking. Agreed.\n\nYou didn't need to have such an extreme reaction though. Even if you felt anger, what purpose did screaming at your sister serve? This could have been a mature conversation. \"Sis, I'm not comfortable with you walking into my apartment without knocking. In fact, it really startled and upset me. The door code is for use when you are watching my pets only, not to come and go as you please. Please respect my privacy.\" That would be an age-29 appropriate way to address the situation. \n\nYour mom didn't need to get involved, but I do find it ironic that you take issue with your mom \"berating you\" - aka, parenting you - over screaming at your sister.", "ESH - Your sister shouldn't have entered your apartment without some prior communication. You went a bit overboard screaming at her. I understand you screaming the first time when you were startled, but after that you shouldn't have continued screaming. Once you realized it was your sister, you should have taken a deep breath and told her a little more calmly why you were upset.", "My judgement is based on the assumption that this is an isolated incident and you have never communicated these boundaries with the sister who basically lives next door.\n\n\n\n\nYour sister should've called.\n\nYou screaming at her and throwing her out of house is an overreaction.\n\nESH", "ESH You for still withholding the paper instead of helping her out after you realized it was her and her for not calling or texting first and just walking in.\n\nEdited removed extra word and acronym.", "NTA\nScreaming at somebody if they let themselves into my house where I was supposed to be alone would be the mildest reaction I would have.  Your sister shouldn't have to be told to have manners and not enter your house without your permission, that's just common sense. Imagine what could have happened if you were the kind of person who throws things when they get a fright, the least anybody would bw worried about was a sheet of paper. And your mother is an ah to get involved in this at all.", "NTA\n\nim sure your sister left out the detail of breaking into your apartment when she spoke with your mother.", "NTA. Screaming at her isn't ideal, but WTF - I'd get freaked out if *anyone* got into my house w/o warning. \n\nWe have older neighbors who think it 's normal to come into our house even when we don't answer knocks at the door. We repeatedly asked them not to; they still did it.  I finally told them not to b/c our house was \"clothing-optional\" and we were still in the honeymoon phase (#1 is true, #2 less so, but still...). It was mostly the husband who'd barge in, and he now has dementia; it may have been there earlier w/o our knowing, but that's not a great excuse. Anyway, making them think we could be randomly having sex anywhere in the house has worked really well. \n\nBut changing your keycodes sounds completely reasonable. It's not as if she'd have to buy A4 paper on the black market, or spend an enormous amount of money and effort to get it, right?\n\nTranslation for anyone that isn't familiar w/A4 paper: It's as if someone decided it was fine to enter your house without permission to get a standard 8.5\"x11\" piece of copy paper.", "NTA, opening an unlocked door is one thing, unlocking a door is extreme. Being invited over and letting yourself in can be acceptable for some friends and family (if they want you to simply come in if invited over)\nThis is insane, coming over unannounced and uninvited to unlock the door so she can ask a favor of you.", "NTA\n\nThat was out of line for your sister to just walk into your house uninvited and unannounced. I\u2019m pretty close with my siblings and I still manage to respect their homes and privacy. \n\nI would have yelled at someone who scared me like that also.", "They had their own. They don't know mine. I just deleted their code for the door", "Yeah, Mom and Sister are mad at OP; they didn't learn anything.\n\nThese people clearly don't live in the US. You got shot doing that shit here.", "It's possible she knocked and announced herself and OP didn't hear it because of the noise cancelling headphones, though OP is still NTA in that case. Sister should have apologized and agreed not to enter without permission in the future, instead of running to mommy and getting her to try to interfere and berate OP.", "No it\u2019s not an observation. You don\u2019t know any of her life that she doesn\u2019t show you. You don\u2019t know if she\u2019s had trauma, incidents or anything like this. It\u2019s so weird to come on here and tell people they their reactions to certain things are overreactions.", "\"everybody sucks here\" fyi!", "Perfect.\n\nWe have the key for the appartement of our son and we would not use the key without given the permission from him.\n\nI hope you can relax now.", "As OP is putting a post, asking strangers from the internet about what they think, she would have given out details of any past trauma, as is customary on reddit. If I see an update which spells that out, I would reconsider my judgement.\n\nSister doesn't understand boundaries and OP hasn't mentioned if she has set those boundaries before.\n\nI stand by what I said.", "Thanks! I kept thinking possibly EAH for everyone\u2019s an AH lol! :)", "what boundaries? is \"knock on the door and request permission before entering someones home\" something you need to explicitly tell people?", "Yea because someone is asking for advice they\u2019d just share their whole life story with you. You\u2019re really smart \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "that one would make sense too lol!"]}
