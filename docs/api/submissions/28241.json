He never walked, talked, or developed normally again.\n\nI've never forgotten that scene and have always been afraid that it could happen to my child. He is 4 months old, and I want to protect him from everything. So, I asked my husband never to engage in this play with him. I explained the reason, and he agreed. He said he understood and wouldn't do it.\n\nBut yesterday, I caught him doing it secretly. I had gone to the bathroom, and when I returned, I saw him tossing our baby in the air and laughing. I was terrified, and I yelled at him to stop. He was startled and said I was overreacting, that he knew what he was doing, that he wouldn't let our child fall. He claimed it was just a game, that our baby enjoyed it, and that he was having fun.\n\nI got furious and argued with him. I told him he was being irresponsible, putting our child at risk, and disrespecting my wishes. I said he had no awareness of the danger, that he could seriously hurt our child, even kill him. I said he had no right to do this, that he should listen to me, that I knew what I was talking about.\n\nHe got offended and argued that I was being paranoid.

Tossing kids into the air is one of the most common causes of preventable injury for small children, especially head trauma. The injury can happen from tossing them up and not realizing there is an object overhead or dropping/falling, or for young babies neck injuries because their muscles aren\u2019t fully developed.", "NTA. For quite a few reasons:\n\n1. This is indeed dangerous behaviour. You could easily replicate it by gently lifting your baby up and down in the air whilst keeping hold of them. Ideally while sat down in a soft area (eg sofa) as an extra precaution. \n2. He overstepped a boundary you had discussed and he agreed to respect.\n3. 4 months is pretty young for any kind of \u201cplay\u201d like this. Considering the head/trunk control they have at that age, that\u2019s going to be a massive strain on babies neck.", "NTA\n\nYour husband is endangering you baby for his own amusement. His hand could slip, he could cough or sneeze or be distracted by something and the child could drop to the ground. It\u2019s a stupid, dangerous game to play. Plus, he\u2019s arguing and trying to defend his risky, reckless behavior. This is a truly bad situation. He needs to stop it now.", "NTA\n\nBabies shouldn\u2019t be tossed in the air. Their necks can be jarred, they can be dropped, etc. Is it likely? No. Is it possible? Absolutely. \n\nI saw a child fall on their head tumbling out of a shopping cart at the grocery store. I\u2019ll never forget it. Head trauma is terrible\u2026as you well know.", "NTA.\n\nYou are not exaggerating. You knew for a fact what could happen. Your uncle probably thought he wasn't gonna drop your cousin either. Accidents happen, but you took it as a very important life lesson. \n\nRegardless, he agreed to what you asked and then when behind your back and that's very disrespectful.", "NTA, your husband knowingly broke a boundary that's really important to you behind your back. He knew it was highly traumatic for you and still is. I don't understand why is he willingly putting your child at risk when he knows the potential consequences.", "He is throwing a 4 month old baby in the air?? NTA. Honestly, I wouldn\u2019t be able to trust his judgment with my baby after witnessing that.", "NTA. I almost died conceiving my daughter, we both almost died during the labor and we both almost died soon after her birth. We had just recovered when I saw her being tossed by her father and I almost ate him alive. Apparently it\u2019s \u201cjust something fathers do\u201d and I don\u2019t give a shit. My baby is not a football and her skull won\u2019t bounce like one.", "NTA. You asked him to simply refrain from 1 thing. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re overreacting or being unreasonable. I mean he\u2019s literally taking a chance on dropping the baby. There\u2019s plenty of other ways a baby can laugh and get enjoyment. Also, I\u2019m going to take a wild guess that your baby isn\u2019t verbally telling him \u201chey dad, I want you to throw me up in the air and catch me.\u201d There\u2019s plenty of other ways to get the kid entertained. But I would just have a talk with your husband about it and say this is the one rule you have. If he has THAT much of an issue with THIS ONE THING, then there\u2019s got to be something more going on there.", "4 months old?!?! NTA! \n\nNo one should be playing catch the baby with a 4 month old! I will say, a little older, maybe a toddler, I personally don\u2019t see the harm but I\u2019m not married to you. I think your husband should respect your wishes.", "NTA. I have never understood when parents do this. It seems so unnecessary and the risks far outweigh any temporary benefits (you can make your kid laugh by doing something else).", "NTA. Your husband is so wrong on this. No matter how careful anyone is, accidents can still happen. You witnessed the terrible results of that first hand. Your husband is completely disregarding your concern for the baby. Anyone who\u2019s worked in an ER would agree with you. \n\nAlso, your baby is only 4 months old. It\u2019s not been so long since he can hold up his head on his own. Those muscles are not yet strong. Your baby is still developing. What your husband is doing is dangerous to your baby. He\u2019s also not being a good partner to you to by so cavalierly disregarding your safety concerns as a mom.", "NTA. Omg how dare your husband. You told him how traumatizing this was and it IS dangerous. I\u2019d be scared to leave the baby with him. You both need to have a serious talk. Can you take the baby to your parents or stay at a friends? I feel like he needs to realize the gravity of the situation and think on how he messed up.", "NTA for all the reasons you know and everyone has already said. Show your husband this post. \n\nAnother big issue with this, at least if it was me in that situation, idk ifni could trust my husband anymore. After explaining why I'm not ok with this and him agreeing and then catching him doing it in secret. On top of that, excusing his behavior and down playing the risks when you have firsthand witnessed a worse case scenario is beyond wtf. But this would make me wonder what else he's lied about and show me that I can not trust him to be honest with me, especially when it's important and traumatic things. If he can't be trusted on the big things, how can he be trusted on the little things? \n\nRight now, it's ok to not be ok. He endangered your child, hid his actions from you, knowing full well you have trauma associated with the action, and then put you down and excused his actions and responsibility when you got upset. Ask him if he thinks your uncle purposely let your cousin fall, or does he think your uncle had it also? \n\nI'd tell him he needs to go stay elsewhere for a few days, or I'd take baby and go stay elsewhere for a few days. Allow yourself time to calm down some and think about how this affects everything. \n\nYou can let him know that a bunch of internet strangers have voted, and this one act has put him in shit dad and shit husband territory. \n\nIf it wouldn't be tonmuch for your family, can you have your uncle call your husband and talk (down to him if he feels it's necessary) about how stupid he's being. And no matter how much control he thinks he has, anything can happen. Putting an infant at risk isn't worth it. And his side is a neglectful hill to die on", "NTA \n\n>. He claimed it was just a game, that our baby enjoyed it, and that he was having fun.\n\nOof. So what if it was \"fun\"? Something can be both fun and dangerous and 9% worth the risk.\n\nBabies enjoying things does not make it safe. Babies enjoy all kinds of stupidly risky things that parents need to protect them from.", "NTA, he knew you were traumatized and he AGREED that it wasn't something you would do. He can't go back now!", "NTA \n\nA little older of a kid, maybe a baby that's walking already? Yeah, cool. That young? Nooo", "NTA - just because your husband is careful NOW, does not mean that he could slip up in the future. You are not over-reacting to your husband's actions with your child.", "NTA. You communicated it very clear and your husband agreed. He's doing it because he enjoys it and baby enjoys it but there are heaps of other lower risk things they could do instead. \nEven if it's a lower risk activity, it is something that is traumatic for YOU.\nI always think, if it matters so much to one person and not as much to the other, and they can find suitable alternatives, then why insist doing it?", "Nope.\n\nNever tempt fate when the safety of your kids is at stake. You're well within your rights to demand an immediate cease to him throwing your son into the air. What happens if your son squirms when he on the way down and your husband can't catch him or winds up looking your son in his eyes trying to catch him?\n\nThere are far safer ways to bond with children while having fun. Tell him to STOP being such a jerk.", "NTA.\n\nYou told him about his boundary before and he agreed not to do it. 4 months especially, your husband is playing a very stupid game.", "NTA, even if he doesn't drop him, this is incredibly dangerous for babies, they're not built for acrobatics.\n\nYou should probably check he also knows that shaking babies is bad.", "Yikes at 4 months?! Too young.. I wouldn't be happy either.", "You're MOSTLY NTA\n\nSlightly so for yelling at him while he was doing it because you could have startled him into dropping the baby.  \n\n\nI'm sure your uncle never meant to hurt your cousin, though. Yet it still happened.", "NTA. There is no valid reason to throw your baby! You\u2019re hardly being paranoid; you literally know someone whose life was destroyed by this stupid little game. Sit and bounce him on your knee or something.", "NTA my first head injury was from this as a baby. Obviously I don't remember but my dad said he accidentally tossed me too high and into a moving ceiling fan. Not worth it", "NTA, I'd make him go with you to the next appointment with the pediatrician and ask the doctor to explain to him how dangerous that activity is.  If you warn him in advance I bet your husband will beg you not to say anything to the doctor because he KNOWS you're right.  \n\nInfo: does your husband have a history of pushing or violating your boundaries when he doesn't feel like respecting them?  This just seems like such a needlessly dangerous power play.", "Even apart from your trauma, it's dangerous. Heck, your trauma is the result of having the misfortune to be present when its danger was proven.\n\n*And your child is a fucking four month old.* It's not even like he was doing it to a one year old or two year old. Who on earth even THINKS of doing that to a four month old baby?\n\nThe fact that he's arguing and fighting over it instead of apologizing means leaving him for the sake of the baby's safety could be justified.\n\nNTA\n>I was terrified, and I yelled at him to stop. \n\nI do want to say, however, that if you yelled at him while he was doing it, startling him by yelling could have caused the accident. I'm sure it was an automatic reaction on your part, so it doesn't count as assholery, but yelling in that moment was objectively dangerous.", "NTA - my dad was doing that to my cousin and she arched her back.  \nShe went flying backwards and landed on the concrete.  \nThankfully there was no permanent damage but he never did it again.", "NTA. Show him some pictures of what head trauma looks like.", "NTA no way. It's unnecessarily risky behavior. Ugh I'm so sorry you experienced that. How absolutely horrific.", "No! You witnessed first hand what dangers can occur", "NTA. I feel that way about spinning children indoors. Outside where there is nothing to run into that\u2019s silly and fun and they can fall onto the grass.

It might make you keep your child from having age-appropriate developmental experiences down the line.  A professional may be able to help you and your spouse come to an agreement and a plan moving forward.\n\n2) It is understandable that you are upset.  Maybe you and your husband can come up with similar activities- maybe less high over the bed only or in the summer months in a pool\u2026 set some physical activities that support engagement between your husband and child.

Support that in a way you are both comfortable with.\n\n3) I hope you find peace and good communication within your family & congratulations on your relationship and growing family.", "NTA at all!\n\nIt\u2019s a reasonable boundary before you even consider your history and trauma. \n\nEspecially a baby that young!\n\nBring it up with your pediatrician.

There is no reason he needs to be doing that. It's not like the baby will be missing out on some key moment of childhood. Also it's inherently dangerous and you obviously have experience with that. Your husband is being an asshat.", "NTA I think you need to go stay with friends or family for a bit. Maybe go to a pediatrician together and ask if this is safe. (Since he is not listening to you.)

Baby\u2019s brains are softer than adults, as are their neck muscles. And their heads are proportionally bigger than their bodies.
