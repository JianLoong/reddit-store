I was eager to talk more as I've been looking for friends. We quickly learned we lived in the same area & decided to meet up at my house. \n\nDays later, they came, the kids went up to play. My husb was upstairs, I invited her to sit so we could chat. It was nothing like when we met prior. I tried to crack jokes & make small talk. She never laughed.\n\nAfter an hr, she had asked me something & interrupted my answer with \"Ugh, am I ever going to see your husband??\"\n..I told her he'd probably be down soon. I decided to go check on the kids. I passed my husb on the stairs, and about 20 seconds later I could hear her laughing. I know he's funny, that's why I married him, but it seemed off to me. When I came back down he looked confused & said \"I was just telling her how our dog is fat.\"\n\nNow that he was down, the convo flowed smoothly. I made lunch for the kids-while I was cleaning she asked if hers could spend the night. I agreed. First she told me to clear it with 'the man of the house'...\nShe then asked if I had soy milk and 'good snacks'. I said no, but if it was a dietary thing we could run to the store. We went, I purchased stuff for her kid that she approved of, & a case of tea she mentioned she would like.\n\nWhile I'm putting the groceries away, she told me her husband didn't approve of the sleepover. By this time it was getting close to dinner, I was unsure of how to tell her it was time to leave. My husb kept giving me looks, but neither of us brought it up. So..I made us all dinner.\nClose to 8, they left. On her way out, she took all of the teas. A few hours later, she called my husb. He ignored it. She texts me, \"Can you meet me and bring me my milk & snacks?\"\n.\nShe asked me to babysit while her and her husband run errands, said it would only be for 2-3 hrs. \n6 hrs later, I haven't heard from her, until finally she calls and asks if her kid can spend the night. At that point, I said fuck it why not, but I need you to pick <child> up early as I have work. Next morning at 8, I ask if she's on her way. She asked for another hr. 20 min later, she said she was in a car accident and couldn't come. I asked if she was okay etc. She was & told me she would need a ride. I went. On our way to her house, she kept talking about how tired she was & would love to get a nap in..\nEssentially I said \"that sucks. Maybe your kid can nap with you. byee\"\n\nA few days later, she asks me to babysit while her and her husb shop for bday presents. She specified that it would only be for 2 hrs.\nTime comes, I call and ask where she's at. She tells me they haven't even left yet. I told her I can no longer babysit, & I'm on the way. They weren't home.\nShe finally txted and said they had left to grab some lunch, they needed another hr.\nI was about to lose it and abandon this child at their doorstep. \n\nSince then, I have about 13 texts and more missed calls from her, all asking me to babysit. I refuse to answer. AITA?", "created_utc": 1670204805, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zct37g/aita_for_refusing_to_babysitever_again/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
