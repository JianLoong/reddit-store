You can\u2019t actually stop your sister from joining you on the trip if she wants to go, since your dad is driving and all. \n\nBut I think you have the right to be upset that she is using a stressful journey on your road to some kind of treatment to basically do some shopping. It does come off as disrespectful at the very least. \n\nOut of curiosity, has she expressed her sympathy/empathy about this trip or your condition at all? Is this normal behavior for her?", "NTA. You deserve to experience this on relatively your own terms.\n\nOn the flip side, ask your dad if you can have your own room if she comes. That's winning.", "So NTA.  This a tough visit for you.  Your sister cheapens your struggles by touristing.  Your father should be there to support you, not to carry grasping sister\u2019s shopping bags and discuss her tourist highlights.", "NTA\n\nThis is NOT a vacation or a shopping trip, it's a MEDICAL APPOINTMENT.", "NTA. This is a medical/health trip, not a girls shopping weekend. Your dad should be more understanding and your sister was wrong for making a fuss.", "Kind of tough, without knowing - was she frequently sidelined from spending time with your parents or you because of your condition?\n\nI\u2019d go with NAH for lack of really knowing. \n\nMaybe she wants to be there when you\u2019re done, but doesn\u2019t want to fawn over you beforehand and cause more stress. Otherwise, why wouldn\u2019t she just go on her own?", "EDIT- NTA after OP'S comment reply. \n\nINFO- Is she often pushed aside for you and your illness?", "NAH Just because it sounds like you haven't talked about it with them properly.\n\nAs someone who has a sibling with a non-life-threatening incurable disease, you might not realise how your health also affects her and she might just see this as a way to a) spend time with you and your dad and b) be part of something that she's usually shut out of, even though it affects her life as well", "NTA. It's not a vacation, and I can see why it would upset you.\n\nCan you suggest visiting the city together for fun a different weekend?", "NTA -\n\n It's not a sightseeing or pleasure trip -its for a medical procedure.  I get it, if you don't feel well it will be more restful in a shared room with less people than having someone who is using the opportunity to go shopping and sight-seeing.  I also think it makes a difference that your sister is an adult and can go do those things on her own time, so to speak. \n\nI hope that this helps you and you can get some relief from your pain.", "NTA\n\nTotally reasonable ask to my thinking.", "ESH. Your father drives you to this appointment, and it's up to him to decide if he's willing to bring her. If your sister plans to come and spend her days sightseeing or doing other activities, I don't see how she'd bother you.\n\nOn the other hand, I think she lacks empathy because you're going to this town to try to heal yourself and she saw it as an opportunity to have fun. I don't know if that hurts you but I understand if it does and maybe that's the real reason you wouldn't want her to come.", "If you don't talk about the missery you feel they will feel like it's no big deal to go on a vacation with you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm just on the fence about whether your sister is being insensitive by asking to tag along and treating it like a mini vacation.\n\nShe would be an asshole if she pulls her Dad away to help her get around. Or if she demands that you adjust your schedule to accommodate her. But it sounds like she is hitching a ride. It's hard to tell what her intentions are for this situation. \n\nGoing with NAH.", "NTA at all, but maybe a compromise could be reached by booking adjoining hotel rooms, that way you can have your privacy after the appointment while still traveling together? Maybe dad could ask the hotel and explain that you have a medical procedure and will need time alone and maybe ask for a lower rate for adjoining rooms to accommodate for your health so you can rest quietly ((if money is even an issue on the table, and I don't know if this would work, but it'd be worth a shot if you're open to this idea.))\n\nI've got a whole mess of chronic illnesses/pain, since I was 11, but unfortunately we're so broke couldn't afford hotels in LA, I had to be in a 4+ hour car ride to the specialists (leaving at 3am), lots of testing long wait times, and then long 4+ hour ride home. A lot of times, I'd have to be lying uncomfortably in the back seat, sometimes crying. It sucks being a sick kid. I hope your treatment works well for you!", "NTA. This isn't a social outing. This is about a potential solution for you. It's hard enough without your sister.", "My condition is something I\u2019m more or less apathetic towards, I\u2019m in pain everyday, but I can\u2019t do much for it as pain meds don\u2019t affect it as it\u2019s in my nerves. My family (including my sister) doesn\u2019t talk about it, so I don\u2019t. But my family has a history of miscommunication which I think is at the root of this, that I do acknowledge. \n\nAs for her behavior, i couldn\u2019t say one way or another if it\u2019s typical. I can understand her point as we never vacation, but it\u2019s not a trip, it\u2019s an appointment to me.", "My condition isn\u2019t one that prevents my family from interacting with each other, moreso prevents me from doing what I like. I\u2019ve had to drop a sport I loved doing, and have had to call off work because of it, but it\u2019s never affected her specifically. I try to not let it affect them, as I understand that it can be draining, it\u2019s draining for me. \n\nI don\u2019t like fawning, I actively discourage it from friends, family, and strangers.

I have never accompanied her to any of these, when she had them.", "I think you explained it really well here in your second part. I understand I wouldn\u2019t really see her, but to me it feels it would be really disheartening to me that she gets to spend the entire day doing fun things and I\u2019m just stuck in an appointment the entire day.

How is the sick girl an AH", "It\u2019s very clearly not a vacation. The reason for the trip is known to everyone involved.", "Interesting. It\u2019s possible then that your sister doesn\u2019t recognize just what you deal with. She may not realize how much pain you are in and what this appointment really could mean for you. \n\nMaybe before the trip you, your dad, and your sister just sit down and you talk about your condition, in full, no holds barred (or you know, bars held at your discretion, it is your condition after all). Maybe it\u2019s been kept to the shadows (so to speak) for so long your family doesn\u2019t fully understand it. \n\nUltimately, you\u2019re emotions are valid and you are right to feel disrespected and annoyed.

Good luck!", "NTA then", "I partially understand that but also- just because you have a difficult day doesn\u2019t mean that your sister should have a bad day and isn\u2019t allowed fun. I think it would be valid to say she can go and do xyz but you don\u2019t wanna hear about how great it was etc", "Yet she is asking to come along and the family thinks nothing of it.", "Thank you! I do sincerely hope it can help me, but I don\u2019t have my hopes up very high as the program does state that it\u2019s not a guarantee of fixing, even if I get accepted. \n\nI will sincerely take your suggestions into consideration, and I appreciate your input :]", "This is really good advice. I vote NTA, but it is possible that the family doesn\u2019t understand what this appointment means to OP. It is completely valid to not want to go on a stressful, medical appointment/over night stay with someone who is treating it like a vacation. I am wondering (and hoping) that the sister wants to tag along because she thinks it\u2019s a minor medical appointment and not a big deal. Maybe sister will realize how inappropriate it is to tag along on this kind of medical trip.", "No matter what, I wish you the best of luck!", "\ud83e\udd1e", "Fingers crossed and wood knocked on for ya, OP!"]}
