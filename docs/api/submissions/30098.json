The only \"traitors\"  here are the people giving you crap about this who clearly don't understand what the pledge or their country actually stands for. \"Damm you for using the freespeech I pretend to care about\".  You have a legal right to not take the pledge, but if you do that it all of a sudden becomes obvious how unhealthy their goose stepping is.  If this becomes a issue you have every right to sue the school for violating your civil rights. \n\nLook at a list of countries that demand pledges of allegiance....they are not good countries.", "NTA. You actually DO have the right to ignore the pledge. People sit it out for all sorts of reasons or no reason and that's perfectly fine because it's their right as American citizens to choose not to participate in the pledge. Your teacher violated your rights.", "NTA and this is the sort of thing that gets people abroad to describe America as a Cult.\n\nAnd you're certainly using your time wisely vs showing allegiance to a symbolic overly revered piece of fabric and the nation.\n\nYou're doing more for your country by studying than standing up for a few minutes.", "NTA you had a legitimate reason and not saying pledge isnt gonna blow ur school up or cause ww3 they need to calm down. FOREWARNING; be careful you might attract some hardcore right winged people", "NTA\n\nEspecially considering you tried to explain that you were busy and didn't notice. \n\nStill NTA even if you did notice. The pledge of allegiance is weird tribalism/nationalism that I don't think has any place in a place of learning.", "NTA - the pledge is jingoistic nonsense and he's clearly bought into it hook, line and sinker.  You're fine, ignore him, and your friend who doesn't comprehend that.", "NTA, one of the great things about the United States of America is that the First Amendment protects your right to not stand up for the pledge of allegiance, especially if you're in a public school. It is quite literally your right to ignore the pledge. People, of course, have the right to get angry about it. But the teacher was out of line.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
