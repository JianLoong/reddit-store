I didn't know why at the moment, all I knew is that my mom was pregnant with my little brother (18M). \n\nWhen I was 12, I overheard my dad talking with a friend of his and that's when I found out that my mother cheated on my dad and got pregnant with my little brother which is why they divorced (after paternity tests, my little brother was his but they still divorced, duh). Everything suddenly made sense, why my dad hated my mom so much, why everytime my mom and dad were around each other, my mom would look miserable and sad and my dad would look mad. I knew I couldn't tell my brother, he'd only blame himself so I kept the secret for years. \n\nOnto the problem: last week was my brother's 18th birthday and the family was over, we were having fun and both my parents were there. As I previously mentioned, they had their usual angry and miserable looks on their face and I guess my brother had enough. He snapped and asked my dad why he's always such a mean dick to our mom. My dad calmly told him that he's a mean dick to her because she's a cheating whore. That started a screaming argument between a few family members, my brother didn't believe it and my mom confirmed the reason they divorced. He looked at me asking if I knew and I confirmed that I did. He was so betrayed and he asked how could I keep this from him. I apologized and told him I found out on accident and that I didn't tell him because it doesn't matter, they're our parents and he's my brother. She didn't get knocked up by a random dude. \n\nAnyways, he's been giving me the silent treatment and some of his friends reached out to berate me for not telling him.

It still hurts. I would mend the relationship with your brother and start with an apology.\n\nNTA - because all the adults created a mess than the kids had to deal with.", "NTA. It was not your place to tell him, this is an adult created mess that you should not have had to process at 12 when you found out.", "NTA. He would have reacted poorly whenever he found out. It wasn\u2019t your place. Impossible situation.", "Totally NTA\n\nNor your brother. His an angry teenager, which is understandable and he'll come around.\n\nYour parents had the responsibility to tell you both. - They are assholes for allowing this situation to mushroom as it did.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: His friends are also assholes and need to back the truck up and zip it.", "NAH between you and your brother. Your parents are another story, however. I can understand why he would be upset and feel betrayed, but I also understood why you never told him. He would almost certainly blame himself, even though it was in no way his fault.\n\nI am curious, though. That last sentence; \"she didn't get knocked up by some random dude\". Would that have changed how you felt about your brother if it turned out that you didn't have the same father?", "NTA. Remember how you felt when you found out? He's feeling the same. And to hear from his father directly could not have been very easy. He's not angry AT YOU. He's just angry. \n\nAdd to that, he's a young guy, maybe slowly figuring out that the world's an unfair place and all. He is just angry about the way things are and he's obviously not handling it v well. \n\nGive it some time, and then approach him. Try not to raise voices when you talk and remind him that humans make mistakes and that his mother's fault is not his fault too.", "i\u2019m going to say NTA to you, because you didn\u2019t want to hurt your brothers feelings and potentially cause a rift in the relationship between you two (especially since it seems you are all he\u2019s got, given your parents are miserable around each other and probably towards him and he\u2019s more than likely picked up on that.) \n\nYour parents are both huge A\u2019s. They don\u2019t have to be happy happy around each other but the least they can do is remain civil for the sake of their children, the fact they kept this miserable persona up on his birthday and your dad caused a huge screaming match on what was supposed to be a special day solidifies his YTA role. \n\nyour brother most likely just needs time to process, this is pretty stressful and upsetting for him.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not your place to tell your little brother why they divorced. That\u2019s something that should have come from your parents. Sadly, the truth came out at his birthday party. Just give him time.", "NTA. Understand that you are his \"safe\" person for lashing out...he knows you will still love him. It sucks, for you,  but he feels deceived and confused and needs to blame someone. He's just turned 18 and knows he  still needs their help. Hewill probably settle down soon but he needs some help processing this news (maybe you, also. That's a lot to keep inside). Suggest some therapy and perhaps you can join some sessions. Your Dad has plenty of reasons to be angry, but, if, he can't restrain himself and hide his emotions then it's time to cease with the joint celebrations.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your responsibility to discuss someone else\u2019s divorce, even your parents. He always could have asked, and I\u2019m genuinely surprised he waited until he was 18.", "I guess I\u2019m going against the grain here but YTA. If I knew my sibling had kept that big of a secret from me about our parents it\u2019s not something I would quickly forgive. Your brother had to live 18 years completely oblivious to why his parents hate each other, he was bound to formulate his own theories and grow closer to one side or the other. \n\nI understand not telling him when he was young, but at some point he deserved to know without needing to break emotionally and demand an answer. There\u2019s no one here to blame but your mother for her actions, and you could\u2019ve helped him see that it wasn\u2019t his fault. But now he\u2019s likely more pissed than anything that you all kept this from him.", "YTA.  You alone projected the divorce on your brother.  His existence has nothing to do with the divorce.  The divorce was your mother's fault 100% for cheating and nothing else.  Your dad was kind enough to conceal the reason because she cheated on him, not you.  You are focused on the wrong thing, her getting pregnant.  It is her cheating that is the issue.  Obviously as an older kid, it would be helpful to know why they hate each other so much.  Of course he feels betrayed by you.  You could have helped him to understand, but instead you still think it is because she got pregnant that they split.  That was the reason she was caught, not the reason they divorced.  Cheating was why they divorced.  Quit blaming your brother and blame your mother.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's up to the parents to do so.", "I apologized to him because I do feel incredibly guilty about not telling him and if he hadn't been my father's biological child, I probably would've but I know him enough to know he's probably still blaming himself right now", "Yeah I gotta admit, I used to read stories here thinking that people don't get involved in other's businesses like they do in stories byt then it happened to me. I did tell them to mind their business", "Re: the last point, I think OP means that their brother would feel that they have a personally specific reason to know (ie the dad they thought was their bio dad isn't actually)", "I agree about my parents. They literally only see each others twice a year and they can't even keep it together. My dad is infuriating with his anger problems and my mom still calls it a mistake so I think she's not even owning up to her shitty decision of cheating", "I mean, while it doesn't justify the screaming and ruining OPs brothers birthday, I can't really blame the dad for getting angry that his cheating ex let their son believe he was the issue up until that point.", "Possibly, or he might be feeling hurt and betrayed that everyone in the entire family knew this great big secret, and he was the only chump walking blissfully around with no idea. \n\nKeep mending that bridge with him, and explaining that you were in an impossible situation. He's not to blame though, your mom is.", "Ah, I see now. Yes, that makes more sense.", "they both need to heal on their own, it would be a good idea for them to confront what happened and go to therapy to work through it but i don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to happen in a while, even if someone suggests it\n\nwhat happened is entirely your mothers fault for cheating, and your fathers fault for letting his anger control what happens to the people around him. It wasn\u2019t your place to tell your brother what happened nor was it your fault. I hope everything turns out okay in the end", "As the step parent on the other side (with the non cheating spouse after they divorced), often it goes much further than just the cheating.  They way the parents behave towards each other during and after a divorce continues the insult and abuse from the cheater, including concealing it from the kids no matter how much they are disgusted by the other person and suffering from the misplaced anger of the kids.  It's a hard internal battle for the non cheater parent.  They want to tell you so you understand and can hold the responsible party responsible and quit taking out your anger on them, but a decent parent wants you to have both parents and knows the person cheated on the spouse, not the child, although they do rip apart that child's household.  I still don't know if the now adult kids know the ex cheated.  We both hate seeing the ex at events and will only attend ones we have to when ex is there.  We have been subject to decades of abuse from ex, so that hate will not go away.  The kids expecting to it is unrealistic, quite insulting, and invalidating.  If we never had to see ex again, we would be popping open cases of champagne and dancing.", "absolutely, i\u2019m in no way blaming the father for his reaction. I would be furious too\n\nwhat\u2019s bothering me is how even after all these years neither of them (Mother included.) refuses to seek betterment for themselves and to try and remain civil for the sake of their child. Their younger son has grown up with a dysfunctional relationship between his parents which has obviously stressed him quite a bit and now he feels as if it is his fault. \n\nThis could\u2019ve been resolved if both parents chose to heal for the sake of their child", "Thank you"]}
