I would say instead something like \"Grandpa and grandma are quite old/busy/far away (whatever is appropriate for your situation) and we will see them next time when they can\". When older, she might understand better, but for small child the idea that it isn't loved enough can be quite traumatic.", "YWNBTA  \nI think in this situation honesty is the best policy but be gentle and selective. I have a paternal uncle who is the worst, like literal nightmare fuel, but my parents never told me that. They let me make my own conclusions from witnessing his actions or telling me what he had done, without saying what they thought about what he did. They never said, \"uncle is the worst\" they just said \"uncle is in jail again.\" So I would say tell her that they aren't around but let her make of it what she will,  telling her that they don't care to see her is a bit harsh, but you can say that they are busy and you'll see them when you can. She'll grow to make her own conclusions about it as she grows.", "NTA though I\u2019d soften the blow a bit.  She\u2019s at that age where it\u2019ll hurt badly if the delivery is wrong. Does she see your parents more often?  If so, I\u2019d probably encourage that relationship more and then wait a bit until she\u2019s older to explain.", "To me it initially seems unnecessary to tell her. If the thought of having great grand parents makes your daughter happy then why change that. HOWEVER, if you think that her grand parents will end up disappointing your daughter in the future it might be necessary to align expectations accordingly. In the end it's your call. It's impossible for us (reddit) to conclude what is necessary in this situation.", "No judgement here... But if your daughter is wanting to foster a relationship with them, allow her to. She can make her own decisions as she gets to know them more", "You wouldn't be the A-hole but I feel like it depends how you do it.\n\nMy mum personally supported the connection and allowed me to meet with mine but made sure I understood that it wouldn't be my fault or personal if they weren't interested or randomly stopped wanting to see me as much.\n\nJust explain the situation and make sure she understands that regardless she has your support with whatever she chooses.", "If you are leaving it up to them to do all the contact then saying they don\u2019t want to see her and build a relationship with her isn\u2019t an unbiased view and possibly not accurate. You\u2019re not putting in the effort to maintain that relationship for her, if you leave it completely up to them. If she is excited about seeing them again I would help her to try and set up another time to see them. Then she can form her own view. \n\nIn saying that we have family who have not met my kids and will not meet them because they are toxic. We explain it once they start asking that they aren\u2019t very nice people and we would prefer to spend time with xyz - then we plan a fun outing with those people.", "Tough call. I'm not sure its an AH thing, but if I had to I'd I'personally classify it as a a little bit YTA. Its putting a lot of pressure on a nine year old to heed mom's perspective, when a lighter 'we'll have to see' and a focus on redirecting her to recognising that she is loved and appreciated by many people sends a better self-esteem message.", "YWNBTA I feel in this situation you'd know what advice to give to your daughter best, given the nuances and relationship dynamics.\n\n3 times in 5 years is really very little if the paternal grandparents were really interested in having a presence in your daughter's life", "YWBTA, she's only talking about them because she has just seen them. If you don't bring them into the conversation,she'll soon stop talking about them, until another year passes. Eventually, she'll see that they're tokenistic grandparents, especially if she sees her friends have more involved grandparents, for her to make a comparison.\n\nI wouldn't say anything for now, no point in tainting the relationship. \n\nAs for not being judgemental or biased. Remember, children need guidance, so sometimes judgement has to happen in order for a parent to show a child what their values are and aren't.", "YWBTA. \n\nWhy crush her spirit? She saw her grandparents and had a lovely time and wants to foster a relationship with them. Sure, it\u2019s unlikely to work out that way but she\u2019s 9. Let her have this. She\u2019ll learn for herself in time that they\u2019re people who have a once a year guest appearance in her life. Speaking negatively of them will only serve to make her question if you\u2019re the reason why it is that way.", "YWBTA, you should never bring kids into adult business unless there are genuine safety concerns. She will see as she gets older that they put no effort in.", "YWBTA. It doesn't matter what you think, she needs to be the ond to form an opinion on her own. If you say that to her, it'll taint her opinion and next time, she'll tell them exactly what you said.", "YWBTA. And I wouldn\u2019t be the least bit surprised if they are keeping their distance because they don\u2019t want to have to deal with you", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She wants to see them, so why not set up a visit?", "NTA\n\n\"I am so glad you love spending time with your grandparents. We can see them as often as they would like. Every time they've asked before, we've made plans to see them. As soon as they ask again, plans will be made ASAP. in the meantime, why don't you do a drawing  or write a letter telling them how much you appreciate spending time with them.\" \n\nYou don't need to say more. Time will say it all. \n\nI read something that stuck with me. It was about marriage, but it applies to all of our love relationships- with our parents, kids, etc. YOU don't need to be cruel to your loved ones if something they do or say or think is stupid, wrong, whatever. The world will step right in and tell them how they are wrong. And the world will be merciless about it. You don't need to be the bad guy and be but I need to tell them the truth. The truth will out. And you might've been wrong.", "Ywbta.  Why tell her this?  This is like telling her that they don\u2019t really love her.  She thinks they do and it sounds like they do make an arrangement to see her several times a year so leave this alone!  You will only harm her by saying anything negative!", "INFO: Are you willing to be more proactive to foster a relationship between them? If your daughter wants to talk to them or arrange to see them, will you pick up the phone and call them to suggest it, or will you leave it up to them? Leaving it up to them may have worked until now, but if your daughter really likes them and is too young to keep up contact by herself, YWBTA to not at least make an effort on her behalf.\n\nIf you do try that and they are not receptive, I'd say NTA if you give her an age-appropriate explanation. As in, not \"your grandparents don't want to see you\" which could hurt a young child deeply. But maybe \"sorry sweetie, your grandparents are not able to do this more often, but they'll let us know when it's possible\" or something.", "I would respond this way which gives her an idea without denigrating them. If she says \u2018my grandparents said they will see me next Saturday for my birthday with a big present\u2019 and you know that isn\u2019t happening I would respond by saying\u2019 That would be awesome and I hope it happens but because your grandparents live far away they might be too old to travel so far so soon after this trip. But I know they love you and want to\u2019. That way it doesn\u2019t disillusion her but gives her a reason that isn\u2019t her as to why it might not happen.

So there is precious little OP can do about it.\n\nFor me honesty is the best policy. Children understand much more that are given credit for and don't deserve to be deceived.
