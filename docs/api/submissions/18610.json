I would say instead something like \"Grandpa and grandma are quite old/busy/far away (whatever is appropriate for your situation) and we will see them next time when they can\". When older, she might understand better, but for small child the idea that it isn't loved enough can be quite traumatic.", "YWNBTA  \nI think in this situation honesty is the best policy but be gentle and selective. I have a paternal uncle who is the worst, like literal nightmare fuel, but my parents never told me that. They let me make my own conclusions from witnessing his actions or telling me what he had done, without saying what they thought about what he did. They never said, \"uncle is the worst\" they just said \"uncle is in jail again.\" So I would say tell her that they aren't around but let her make of it what she will,  telling her that they don't care to see her is a bit harsh, but you can say that they are busy and you'll see them when you can. She'll grow to make her own conclusions about it as she grows.", "NTA though I\u2019d soften the blow a bit.  She\u2019s at that age where it\u2019ll hurt badly if the delivery is wrong. Does she see your parents more often?  If so, I\u2019d probably encourage that relationship more and then wait a bit until she\u2019s older to explain.", "To me it initially seems unnecessary to tell her. If the thought of having great grand parents makes your daughter happy then why change that. HOWEVER, if you think that her grand parents will end up disappointing your daughter in the future it might be necessary to align expectations accordingly. In the end it's your call. It's impossible for us (reddit) to conclude what is necessary in this situation.", "No judgement here... But if your daughter is wanting to foster a relationship with them, allow her to.

You\u2019re not putting in the effort to maintain that relationship for her, if you leave it completely up to them. If she is excited about seeing them again I would help her to try and set up another time to see them. Then she can form her own view. \n\nIn saying that we have family who have not met my kids and will not meet them because they are toxic.

I'm not sure its an AH thing, but if I had to I'd I'personally classify it as a a little bit YTA.

If you don't bring them into the conversation,she'll soon stop talking about them, until another year passes. Eventually, she'll see that they're tokenistic grandparents, especially if she sees her friends have more involved grandparents, for her to make a comparison.\n\nI wouldn't say anything for now, no point in tainting the relationship. \n\nAs for not being judgemental or biased. Remember, children need guidance, so sometimes judgement has to happen in order for a parent to show a child what their values are and aren't.", "YWBTA. \n\nWhy crush her spirit?

And you might've been wrong.", "Ywbta.  Why tell her this?  This is like telling her that they don\u2019t really love her.  She thinks they do and it sounds like they do make an arrangement to see her several times a year so leave this alone!  You will only harm her by saying anything negative!", "INFO: Are you willing to be more proactive to foster a relationship between them? If your daughter wants to talk to them or arrange to see them, will you pick up the phone and call them to suggest it, or will you leave it up to them? Leaving it up to them may have worked until now, but if your daughter really likes them and is too young to keep up contact by herself, YWBTA to not at least make an effort on her behalf.\n\nIf you do try that and they are not receptive, I'd say NTA if you give her an age-appropriate explanation.

How did that go?", "I agree with all this, but just to add, could you quietly reach out to her grandparents to let them know your child would be keen to see them more often?

Honestly, I think that being noncommittal and nonjudgmental is still the best option here.  If you say something denigrating the grandparents, even something as benign-sounding as what you are suggesting here, you run the risk of being 'the bad guy' in the interaction.  You run the risk of her seeing you as a reason why the relationship isn't closer and projecting her pain from that situation onto you.  My mom always let me know her thoughts about my dad's parents and their decisions, and although I could see as an adult that she was 100% right about them and their priorities, as a child I just thought she was being mean.  I thought if she wasn't so mean my grandparents would come around when they said they would.  I definitely projected the lack of interest on their part onto my mom, and it prevented me from seeing the actual relationship with both my mom and my grandparents as it was for a long time.  I think you're doing fine as you are... your daughter is inevitably probably going to get hurt by their lack of interest but I think it's best to let her come to this conclusion on her own and be supportive as she goes.", "Too harsh. \n\nI would go a long the lines of \u201cYour grandparents said they\u2019d let us know when they\u2019re able to catch up.

My kids dad no longer has a relationship with his family. He cut them off (not for a valid reason) and now I am the point of contact with his parents and grandparents when it comes to the kids. I make an effort to send out school pictures, holiday cards, etc. They visit once a year or so. They send birthday and christmas gifts to my house for the kids. Do I contact them as much as my own parents? No. But no still put in effort to reach out consistently so they know they are welcome in our lives.", "We don\u2019t know that, just that they don\u2019t see her much.

Not all grandparents are pushy. We rarely saw my paternal grandparents cause my mom has a crappy relationship with them, but every time we saw them, they were THRILLED.

They may have stepped back in their interaction by trying to mirror OP's energy in the relationship. They may feel some guilt, or humility for whatever reason their son is not in the picture.\n\nOr they may just not be that engaged as OP assumes.\n\nBut it wouldn't hurt to contact them and let them know their granddaughter would like more contact with them and that you would not be averse to assisting them with that.\n\nEdit: But I would not tell my daughter at this point that they are not interested in her.

So i'll go with they do nothing.", "YWBTA, my experience was similar as a child with both my paternal grandparents and father. My relationship with my grandparents went on until they passed away, but the one with my father ended once I realized he wasn't making an effort to contact me. If my mother had told me what you want to tell your child, it would have hurt more than learning g and deciding for myself and likely deprived me of a relationship with my grandparents. \n\nI would encourage your child (by helping if needed) to reach out to their grandparents. From there you will see if a deeper relationship develops. Currently, it's hard for a relationship to develop because it's entirely one-sided which could make the grandparents tread lightly as to not impose.", "All i wanna say is i admire you coming here before you say anything. mad respect", "I\u2019d be very careful with how you proceed because, yes, you are placing some of your biases on your daughter. It\u2019s hard to know WHY the grandparents see her so little - you don\u2019t say if they live across the country or you have a difficult relationship with them. There\u2019s no real detail to help clue us in as to the problem.\n\nI will say this. As a child, my parent insisted their  in laws (my grandparents) were cold and unloving and weren\u2019t interested in us grandkids, and it all stemmed from a conflict they had when my parents married. Later in life, I got more info and insight to the conflict and realized it wasn\u2019t the horrible thing I\u2019d been led to believe. Also, after talking with my extended family, I realized MY parent was a huge part of the reason we were estranged from my grandparents, and that realization made me see my parent in an entirely different light - and not a good one."]}
