During week leading up to his funeral, she reveals that she is not only back with this boyfriend, but she intends to introduce him to the family, especially our now widowed mother (who will the first time in her life now be living alone).

I remind her that she directly involved me and gave me first-hand insight into his behavior when she reached out for help and I put myself in his crosshairs by contacting the authorities.

The fact that you had to call the authorities on him is very concerning. \n\nUnfortunately you can only do so much. Your sister is clearly trauma bonded to this man and only she can help herself get out of it at this point. All you can do is be there for her when she needs your help. Abusers have a way of mentally trapping their victims which keeps them going back to the abuser. It's not a black and white situation.", "Nta. I  am really sorry for your loss as well", "NTA. This gives the rest of the family heads up when he starts again. And he will.", "NTA tell everyone. Abusers like to put on a mask to charm the unwary. The last thing your sister needs if for her family to be charmed by him because she will need her family to believe her if she ever does decide to get away from bf.", "NTA. There's a distance between being nosy and standing up for real concerns. If I understood right, her boyfriend can be dangerous and I don't think that's the kind of behavior you change in a year or so. That's probably gonna be happening again anytime, the only problem is that she might not call you this time if she needs help.", "NTA  - YOur sisters poor choices are hers. Warning the family is prudent given the nature of the situation.", "[deleted]", "Your family absolutely needs to know because she's in danger. I would strongly urge you to try to get in touch with a social worker.", "NTA. The fact that you refer to his behavior as \"not so nice\" and continue to use this formulation throughout your post despite the gravity of the situation is worrisome. You write: \"I'm scared for her well being. Like continuing-to-be-alive well being.\" This isn't \"not so nice\", this is life-threatening abusive and the fact that you think you need to describe it in \"nice\" terms makes me wonder how you and your sister have been raised and what you've been conditioned to tolerate from those closest to you.", "Did you tell your family about the abuse you went through before you introduced them to the family? If not , then YTA.", "Ultimately, your sister shouldn\u2019t have been forced to choose between her family and her problematic partner. You\u2019ve put her in a position where she has to. You did it by violating her privacy, and I\u2019m not sure what reason you had for warning your family about her partner\u2019s behavior unless you seriously believed he\u2019d visit it on the rest of the family. In effect, you\u2019ve forced her to choose. Spoiler: she\u2019ll choose her partner. \n\nI\u2019m trying to absolve you of responsibility here, but as you stated you\u2019ve experienced partner abuse in the past, it\u2019s hard for me to believe that your actions were out of ignorance. Surely you knew that you were cutting off an important source of support and driving her into the arms of her abuser?\n\nMy question is \u201cWhy?\u201d\n\nYTA, unless your answer to \u201cWhy\u201d is something I can\u2019t even imagine.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She's had to be rescued out of other relationships (not all abusive). I'm choosing to not engage with someone who seems to be addicted to toxicity. My continued participation would only be feeding her addiction.\n\nAlso, I didn't violate her privacy. I told my own personal story. I'm the one who went through having to file a police report against a dangerous person and having to speak to that person directly and sit with the worry that this person was going to visit my home and threaten my family. That's my story to tell and no one has the right to say I can or can't tell my own story. So you're wrong there. She gaslighted me by trying to make me think I had no right to my own story.\n\nWhen having to choose between being a \"source of support\" for her and walling my family (including children) off from a very dangerous person, I will choose the latter every single time and not be made to feel guilty for it.", "Her sister made her choice when she went back to the abuser.

I honestly would have told my family also.", "And what\u2019s the prize she gets for outing her sister and her sister\u2019s partner, without letting her sister know?  \n\nHer sister now has fewer options / more pressure to leave her partner. She can\u2019t keep her family and her partner. Because of the way domestic abuse works, this plays right into her abusers hands. It\u2019s not just him saying \u201cit\u2019s you and me against the world\u201d, it\u2019s also her family saying the same thing, when they try to force her to leave her partner or lose them. \n\nIt\u2019s a valid position to take, but it almost always pushes the victim into the arms of the abuser. For that reason, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very good choice."]}
