The plan was that she was going to take them in and her mom would come one or 2 months later after she got her immigration process in line. It has been nearly 8 months and her mom has not come. I initially agreed because I was told it would be temporarily. We live in a small apartment and it is very crowded we have a child of our own too. Our household went from 3 to 5. I can\u2019t even spend time in our living room because they are always watching TV before I make it there. My wife has complained that I no longer spend time in the living room but I tell her I do not feel comfortable, I have never liked living with other people, specially people I have never met. I have asked her where we are at on her mom coming, she said that it is unlikely. I asked if we can find a different family member to at least share the responsibility and she said no I also asked if once her sibling turns 18 if he\u2019s going to move out and take the younger sibling, I got the same answer. I have explained to her that I do not feel comfortable in my own house and she said she\u2019s going to look after her siblings and if I didn\u2019t like it I can figure it out. Expenses have gone up, my privacy is no longer there, we could face eviction as they dont allow more than 4 people here, and I feel like the bad one here for not wanting to live like this. We can\u2019t even go out as a family anymore or talk like a normal couple because they are always there. I have hinted to go out just the three of us but she always brings them along.

Their parents should be.", "NTA. You were straight up lied to, and your wife was fully aware of how this was gonna play out. You could lose your home because your wife won't compromise and at least get a bigger place with everyone on the lease. Yes, you are married, but you also don't have to stay in a miserable situation and just be unhappy. The way you word it seems like your wife expects her siblings to live with yall for years, and that was not the agreement. If I were you, I wouldn't wait around to be evicted for breach of lease. That will seriously make it hard for you to secure future residency. You should tell your wife straight up that yall have to move and get a place that will not only fit everyone but also have her siblings on the lease so you don't screw your credit.", "You are not a normal couple. You were used for this very situation. She does not care about you. She got her American husband to bring her family here. What did you think would happen when mom came. They cannot afford to live in American housing. They would allllll be living with you. Take your child and leave. Whatever worker you were working with to get she stuff squared away call them and let them know. They will not leave and now you are stuck paying for their life. And in Latin families 18 year old males DO NOT MOVE OUT. They are the little kings.", "NTA.  Their mom should be sending enough money to help support her children, specifically getting a larger apartment.", "NAH. But the only solution may be divorce. Do you know why the mother is not coming? Unfortunately she might not ever have planned to come.", "NTA. You were told this arrangement was temporary. Now it seems to have morphed into a long-term thing. First, remind your wife that you live in a rental. Point out the landlord can kick you out for housing too many people. Evictions make it difficukt to find new housing.", "He signed up to TEMPORARILY house them. She went and changed that arrangement behind his back.  \nDefinitely NTA", "I grew up in a family of 5 in a 2 bedroom apartment. I'm used to it, but I guarantee it's not an easy transition for an adult who already doesn't like living with others. Spending time in a corner away from the others is exactly what we did when we weren't actively spending time with each other. If your wife intends for her siblings to stick around, she better get used to you not always being in the living room.\n\nNTA. There may not be many viable options, but this needs to be a discussion. Your wife is an AH for pushing this new lifestyle on you without any discussion, or at least being apologetic about the situation. Increased costs and risking eviction aren't things you get to decide on unilaterally. It sounds like they have other family members as well so your suggestion for sharing the responsibility seems fair and she should at least ask her other siblings if it's possible. \n\nI see in another comment that you offered to move and your wife said no. I would put my foot down for that plan as it's a win for everyone.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeems you will need a divorce if you want things to change. Your wife is an AH.", "NTA. Sit her down and tell her either they go or you will. (Or throw her out if the house is yours) you married her not her family, you only waved to take care of her as long as she was faithful and invested in the marriage and seeing as she prioritized her siblings over you in your own home she\u2019s clearly Not invested in your marriage anymore.", "Im sorry this happened to you. Your wife is the AH in this situation obv. But you have to decide whether this is a sitution you want to stay in. If not, seriously talk with your wife about splitting up until her siblings living situation is sorted out. \n\nAlso, the expenses for the kids. Is your wife paying most of it? If not, she is even more of an AH..", "NTA are you paying all the bills?

I would push for counseling before I bailed.", "NTA you get to make the rules for your life and you\u2019re not being unreasonable, but \u2026.First, this is the for better or worse part you\u2019re supposed to stick it out and come up with solutions not pull the ripcord. Second, those are not your wife\u2019s siblings, those are YOUR siblings. What if the shoe was on the other foot and it was your family that moved in? Assuming you want to be together for ever this should be a relatively short part of your overall experience. You should be able to go out just the 3 of you and generally figure out how to be comfortable in a tight space; but everyone is going to have to give a little. Ultimately the question should be how do you get to a bigger space, I know that not necessarily easy but this is a time to come together and problem solve.", "NAH your needs might just no linger be compatible. Sheis doing what she feels she must for her siblings but you neverr agreed to parent them. You would not ve an ah if you felt like you needed to leave.", "Question: It sounds like you have made ZERO effort to form a relationship with these kids. They have been living with you for EIGHT MONTHS. They are no longer people you have never met. \n\nAlso, have you spoken to your wife about solutions that don\u2019t include kicking her siblings out? It looks like they are here to stay. What has to happen for you to embrace them?", "They\u2019re kids and given the situation it really doesn\u2019t sound like they have anywhere else to go at the moment, but I understand your concerns about space too. So I\u2019ll say this-\n\nYTA for assuming they should just be able to go somewhere else. This is a tough situation for everybody.\n\nYou\u2019re NTA for feeling blindsided because you thought this was going to be temporary and for being concerned about possible eviction.\n\nIs there any way you guys can look into moving to a bigger place?", "ESH.  Your wife is an AH for not working with you more to help find a solution that will work better for everyone.  You are an AH for not being more understanding of the situation.  Where do you expect minor children to go?  Their lives have been tumultuous for who knows how long and they need support and stability.  Sometimes life gets hard. Expecting the 17 year old to move out the second they then 18 and parent the younger sibling is just cold and heartless.  No wonder why your wife shut that down so quickly.  You are a grown ass adult in a two income household who struggles with the COL, how the hell do you expect children to manage?  The smart thing would be for everyone who is working age to contribute financially the best they can so you can move to a bigger space.", "YTA. We have to do hard things sometimes and helping your wife\u2019s siblings is the right thing to do. They are family and children and they need help. All the things you\u2019re describing were going to happen anyway when your child gets older (watching tv, no privacy). You need to try and look for solutions and ways to adapt instead of throwing a constant pity party.", "ESH you did not sign on to this long-term and she has not been straight with you. Both of you need to set up house rules to make this work.", "I hear you OP it\u2019s tough to get in a situation you didn\u2019t sign up for and you are stressed out about it.  \n\nYeah I hate to break it to you but you are the asshole here, these are two kids with literally no other options and they are not your kids but they became your responsibility. You\u2019re talking about leaving your family or kicking them to the street.  \n\nI recommend reaching out to a local adoption agency let them know what your situation is and tell them you want classes and if you are a real man therapy and start working on being a dad to them.  \n\nAgain I get these are not your kids and 99% of the time I would say not your kids not your responsibility but this is a unique situation and they are now even if that is not fair. \n\nIt\u2019s only going to be a season they are with you, imagine how close your wife will be to you if you step up for just a few years.  Imagine having family members who genuinely love you and respect you for being there for them. \n\nIt is not easy but it\u2019s right.  Be a good man.", "YTA I saw in a comment that your wife also pays bills and the oldest of the siblings is also paying for electric. As a child that\u2019s more then enough. Being eldest of 5 I have a sense to protect and care for my siblings. You have had to me to get to know these kids. They are part of your family they are your siblings as well. You should form relationships and set boundaries. It\u2019s terrible to even suggest the kiddo who turns 18 to be responsible for caring for their younger sibling. It\u2019s so hard to maintain things so an individual 18 year old one income to maintain a house for themselves and a child would be hard. Try and sympathize see where they\u2019re coming from see where your wife is coming from. The purest form of love is loving the things and the people your partner loves. Showing love that way is so beneficial in the long run.", "YTA They are young, it isn\u2019t fair for anyone. Do you honestly think they would have moved  away from their family in Venezuela if it wasn\u2019t necessary? You can\u2019t just kick them out. You can find a larger place to live and your wife can be a little bit more flexible in the location. You should put more effort into getting to know them. They must be as frustrated as you leaving their friends and family behind. This isn\u2019t the end of anything, it\u2019s time to figure it out for everyone.", "YTA. Your wife\u2019s siblings are minors and you obviously know what is going on in Venezuela, so the fact that you think there\u2019s even a question as to who the AH is here is mind blowing.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I'm going to assume the best about your wife but i have to say her story is suspicious - I'm not 100% sure her mom is actually coming. Much of Venezuela has been trapped in an economic and crime horror show for years so you can't underestimate the urgency she's feeling about getting her siblings out.\n\n I suspect that you'll need to move out but given that I would get a therapist and negotiate the terms of staying married. If I'm you I'm telling her that we'll need to do a separation if she's unwilling to budge on any of this. Meet with a divorce mediator so you both understand the reality of that. 50/50 custody and no child support and two apartments? 80/20 and some child support, etc...\n\n If she wants to try marriage, articulate your minimum stance:\n\n1) Date night once a week just the two of you. The siblings are old enough to babysit one evening a week.\n\n2) An outing once a week with just your youngest child.\n\n3) The 17 year old gets a small part time job while finishing highschool, preferably at a restaurant or retirement. That will build their job skills and give you some space a couple nights a week.\n\n4) A shared understanding that the 17 year old finishes high school and then goes into an apprenticeship immediately afterwards. That will give them immediate income and insure that they can become genuinely self supporting.\n\n5) They find an apartment or shared room within two months of starting work. L\n\n6) The 11 year old moves in with the 17 year old when they turn 22.\n\nYour wife may not be willing to do this. She may feel strongly that she wants to provide her siblings with an actual childhood in a loving home like she had. I can't call her an asshole for that, but you might be unable to meet her halfway and that doesn't make you an asshole.", "I am also hispanic but from a different country. And you are right, I have seen 25 year olds still living with their parents with no intent to move out. Thats what worries me. Also I might add, as people have mentioned here life is hard where they were at. It was not bad for them. It is odd too that as soon as they came here her mom got remarried and is now living with that other guy and it looks like they have a good life. But to a lot Im the asshole here.", "As i mentioned somewhere else she got remarried about a month after they moved here, she seems to be enjoying her life.", "My wife and I have always worked, her sibling has a part time job and he pays for the electric bill ~$80. She doesn\u2019t want him to pay anything else for whatever reason and I dont push it to avoid problems.", "Something similar is when me and her got together we moved in with my parents for about a month, we looked for a place as fast as we could because neither of us wanted to live with family, but now it is acceptable", "I have tried, the oldest one does not talk at all and if I ask something its a flat yes or no, even with my wife. I suggested we move to a different place maybe closer to my job since I drive 45 mins and she said it is too far", "Op has zero obligation to form a relationship with these kids.

You got thrust into a caregiver role and accepted it. That\u2019s on you. That\u2019s not for everyone. FaMiLy is the dumbest excuse to HAVE to do something", "You have to consider that Op now has two extra mouths to feed", "Thanks for your input. To add, they have 2 more siblings here and a couple aunts and a uncles that could be helping out. My wife is only half sibling, and her family expect her to deal with it, nobody offers a solution.", "This is great. Thank you very much!", "You know, you should put that part about the mother remarrying in the post. To me, that makes it Sound like mom (and maybe wife) conspired to get the kids to America, but she May never had the intention to herself. And I think it would change how a lot on here vote", "OP, you were tricked into this situation. Those saying yta are denying it. This wasn't discussed with you and you are being taken advantage of. You were taken advantage of as soon as your wife suddenly said they were staying permanently. Yes, the kids come from a troublesome place but that doesn't mean the family had the right to trick him into the situation of sponsoring them permanently. Your concerns are valid. I'm shocked that some people are saying your concerns don't matter, only their situation does. Her family isn't entitled to his resources, especially since he's being forced into this. Everyone seemingly lied to him and this is a significant part of the story. \n\nNTA", "OP. Lol. She found you. You don\u2019t push to not cause problems\u2026..She lined you up dude. She found a guy to walk all over. This has always been the plan. Knowing you are whipped enough not to say anything. Get out now. You are being used.", "It is only acceptable with her people, that is what she is saying.", "The question is not whether it\u2019s acceptable or not. Its are you going to cut and run when it gets hard or are you going to work together to find a solution? And again, let's say you\u2019re together for 50 years this is going to be a tiny fraction of that time. Don\u2019t let a rough moment, even if it lasts for months, define what can be a beautiful thing.", "Too far from what? You obviously need to move when your lease is up. Is there no compromise?\n\nAlso, is there any help available for the kids from any agency at all. These kids are essentially refugees and have probably seen and experienced more than anyone should. Have you or your wife looked into ways to help them adjust?", "Your NTA Op, sorry this happened to you", "What constitutes an obligation?", "If you push on this would your wife leave you anyway?  Are you prepared to pay child support for the one kid that is yours and loose your wife?  \n\nI get it man you\u2019re in a no win scenario from the way you are looking at things. I mean I said you are the asshole but really it\u2019s a 1/10 here.  I just want you to really understand what a change in perspective on this could mean for you and your family.  \n\nOP if you are open to doing this, this would be a part of your hero story.  This would be something you can be proud of. The mindset shift is the hardest part and a lot of work.  \n\nI promise if you listen to some folks in your community that will support you and your family it will be hard but worth it.", "It sounds like miscommunication. Between the couple. At the end of the day shit comes up it\u2019s life. That\u2019s her family. It feel cold. The way he talks about them as complete inconveniences is kinda sad. They don\u2019t have much for other options. I know if my partner was having some family trouble and needed to take in their siblings I would be there show up and show out. I think they should work out some boundaries and tv time and maybe get this man some alone time take all the kids out for him to be alone. Then also just have a date with his wife. Couples therapy would also be good for them. I still think he\u2019s TAH for suggesting the soon to be 18year old take the younger child. It would be fair to say hey when they turn 18 they need to prepaid to leave so let\u2019s help these kiddos get there start and be supportive give them resources.", "He said he might. Not that he is.

If they are respectful quiet and keep to themselves they\u2019ll be fine.", "I haven\u2019t had to take in a partners family. I said hypothetically I would. Like I said tho life sucks and it was supposed to change but something changed. They need to communicate with eachother and get couples therapy. Figure out a mutually beneficial arrangement.

Sending them back might not be plausible either.", "Did anyone else marry an American that can sponsor the kids?", "Get over yourself.

What if this is just a stepping stone? \n\nThis whole situation sucks. The wife won't even consider moving closer to his work. She should be open to splitting the distance.", "If you set a hard boundary and your partner agreed to it, only to change it later and you get upset by that...... that does not make you TAH.", "OP isn't the AH, look at it from his perspective. His budget is tight, he has zero privacy now, he tried interacting with the kids but all they do is give yes or no answers, he never agreed to permanently take care of the kids, he's facing possible eviction, and he already has his own child to take care of.", "It def. puts your post in another light. Maybe not to all, but I think you\u2019re NTA. But I am also from a small country in Europe, so maybe I dont understand the dynamics of hispanic families enough.. \n\nBut I think you should put an edit in your post, to add how the mother remarried and how There\u2019s more family around you. All details matter. Good luck on your situation, I hope you figure it out", "Oof. That\u2019s tough.", "But you said he has no obligation to form a relationship. I mean, I guess that no one\u2019s really ever obliged to do anything. We can all do whatever we want.
