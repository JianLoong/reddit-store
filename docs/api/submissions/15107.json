It consists of 4 other guys my age, and one girl (Val 24F). Val is like our little sister. We have known her for 5 years. She used to date one of our other friends (jax 34M). When they got together, me and the guys all warned her about Jax and begged her to leave him. But we didn't know how bad things were until Val broke up with Jax and we found out just how bad Jax was to her, and also how bad his substance abuse was. Our group collectively decided to not be friends with Jax anymore, and took Val in instead. \n\nWe all adore Val and look out for her the best we can. Val was diagnosed with stage 1 cervical cancer a few weeks back. She says she is not worried about it, because stage 1 is curable. She has started radiation and is doing pretty well. She wants to keep it on the down low, and has only told me, and her friend Jessica (24F).  Val and Jessica met about a year ago, they hang out often now. Jessica is alright. She's pretty harsh to Val, and likes to cause drama. Her and Val are complete opposites, so its an interesting duo. Jessica tags along on occasion when Val comes to hang out or goes out with us. \n\nYesterday morning, I called Val to check in on her (as i usually do) and invited her to dinner and a concert that I got a bunch of tickets for from work. She said she would love to, but already had plans with Jessica. I told her to invite her as well. Val and Jessica met up with us at a sushi place before the show. Jessica was already pretty lit, and was being her usual loud, drunk self. One of the boys (Matt) bought shots for the table. When they arrived, Val said she was alright and just said she wasn't feeling super good that day due to low blood sugar issues (shes T1D). Matt jokingly said \"You sure you aren't pregnant val??\" and everyone started laughing. Jessica quickly said \"even if she was, the radiation and chemo would take care of that for her!\". As you can imagine, the laughter quickly turned to confusion and Val was forced to explain to the rest of the boys while Jessica kept laughing. Val was pretty upset, and Jessica didn't think she did anything wrong. After dinner I told Jessica that it was best if she just went home, and offered to call her an Uber. She declined and stormed off. Val was concerned for Jessica, but also grateful that I did that. We ended up having a really good night. The next morning I woke up to tons of messages from Jessicas boyfriend and her friends saying im a POS for that, and that is was an accident on Jessicas part. I'm now questioning if I made the right choice.

After they made fun of someone going through chemo?!?!\n\nSomeone hold my earrings, I need to ...*talk* with Jessica...\n\nNTA", "Nta", "Yes, the radiation will leave her infertile, and will most likey make her menopausal(source: had cervical cancer).", "I see this often and I disagree. All drugs, alcohol included, have slightly different effects on each person. I have seen people change pretty much 180 degrees. I have been around a lot of drunks and sometimes the most chill sober person will become a mean drunk. this doesn't mean that they are a mean person at all. It just means that they shouldn't drink alcohol.", "One of the few jokes from Bill Cosby that I still like talks about this.\n\n\n\"I drink to accentuate my personality!\" \n\"Yea, but, what if your personality is that you're an asshole?\"", "Went to the ER for kidney stone last year with pain bad enough I thought I was going to puke on the floor. They refused to treat me unless I gave a urine sample despite the fact I told them I'm a virgin and on bc for menstrual regulation. I was told if I couldn't provide one, they'd use a catheter which I couldn't stay still for due to the immense pain of the stone. Fuck people that deny treatment due to a \"potential\" fetus when the person has zero chances of being pregnant.", "The time before last at chemo they were starting treatment for a woman 8 1/2 months pregnant. I was surprised.", "Agreed. It's literally a mind altering chemical so i find the argument that \"alcohol brings out the true self\" to be silly", "A dear former student of mine had sickle cell. She was in an experimental trial for treatment and was forced to be on birth control pills that had an increased propensity for stroke. \n\nShe died a week before what would have been her 18th birthday...of a stroke. It's been 10 years and I am still heartbroken.", "Holy crap. I've only ever been asked if there's any chance I might be pregnant because the test/treatment can be harmful during pregnancy, and when I answer no they take my word for it and go ahead with whatever the test/treatment is. \n\nOnce they just asked me if I was sexually active and when I was confused how my sex life was relevant to the chest CT I was about to have they explained that they needed to know if I might be pregnant. And since I'm a little shit I of course explained to the nurse that there's many ways to be sexually active that don't carry a risk of pregnancy. And that it was pretty stupid to not just ask the actual question they need answered, especially in a medical setting.", "NTA: Jessica is rude and immature, sometimes people like that need to be called out"]}
