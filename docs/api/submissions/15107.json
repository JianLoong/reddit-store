It consists of 4 other guys my age, and one girl (Val 24F). Val is like our little sister. We have known her for 5 years. She used to date one of our other friends (jax 34M). When they got together, me and the guys all warned her about Jax and begged her to leave him. But we didn't know how bad things were until Val broke up with Jax and we found out just how bad Jax was to her, and also how bad his substance abuse was. Our group collectively decided to not be friends with Jax anymore, and took Val in instead. \n\nWe all adore Val and look out for her the best we can. Val was diagnosed with stage 1 cervical cancer a few weeks back. She says she is not worried about it, because stage 1 is curable. She has started radiation and is doing pretty well. She wants to keep it on the down low, and has only told me, and her friend Jessica (24F).  Val and Jessica met about a year ago, they hang out often now. Jessica is alright. She's pretty harsh to Val, and likes to cause drama. Her and Val are complete opposites, so its an interesting duo. Jessica tags along on occasion when Val comes to hang out or goes out with us. \n\nYesterday morning, I called Val to check in on her (as i usually do) and invited her to dinner and a concert that I got a bunch of tickets for from work. She said she would love to, but already had plans with Jessica. I told her to invite her as well. Val and Jessica met up with us at a sushi place before the show. Jessica was already pretty lit, and was being her usual loud, drunk self. One of the boys (Matt) bought shots for the table. When they arrived, Val said she was alright and just said she wasn't feeling super good that day due to low blood sugar issues (shes T1D). Matt jokingly said \"You sure you aren't pregnant val??\" and everyone started laughing. Jessica quickly said \"even if she was, the radiation and chemo would take care of that for her!\". As you can imagine, the laughter quickly turned to confusion and Val was forced to explain to the rest of the boys while Jessica kept laughing. Val was pretty upset, and Jessica didn't think she did anything wrong. After dinner I told Jessica that it was best if she just went home, and offered to call her an Uber. She declined and stormed off. Val was concerned for Jessica, but also grateful that I did that. We ended up having a really good night. The next morning I woke up to tons of messages from Jessicas boyfriend and her friends saying im a POS for that, and that is was an accident on Jessicas part. I'm now questioning if I made the right choice.
