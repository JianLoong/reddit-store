We met  online and initially, everything went great. Except one thing...\n\nWe  got this deal going where she plans everything and I pay for  everything. I spend most of my time working so her planning for stuff is  actually a huge bonus to me. + I make a LOT more money than she does so  her paying doesn\u2019t really make sense. But still she kept feeling guilty  and saying she\u2019s definitely gonna pay for one of these dates eventually  but \u201cjust so broke right now\u201d. I told her several times that I actually  like this setup...stop worrying about it...makes no difference to me  who pays for dinner...financial support is not something I require in a  partner whatsoever. But still no matter what I said she kept feeling  guilty about it. I kinda thought maybe it\u2019s cuz she has a pretty decent  job so she should NOT be broke but probably has poor money management  skills so maybe feels a little ashamed for it or something along those  lines.\n\nAnyway, her birthday comes  and I just straight up asked her if she wanted anything for it. She  mentioned this restaurant she\u2019s been wanting to go to for a while but  it\u2019s pricey so she never has...and it\u2019s not a big deal if we don\u2019t go  but blah blah blah\n\nI made  reservations and we\u2019re at the place, everything\u2019s going fine till some  friend of hers walks in, notices her and stops by to say hi. During that  conversation the friend asks about her daughter...At first I thought it  was some kind of an inside joke or something but nope...they really  were talking about her daughter which I had no idea existed till now.\n\nThe friend finally leaves and I ask her \u201cyou have kids?\u201d\n\nShe goes \u201cyeah I have a daughter she\u2019s 12 her name is...\u201d In a really non nonchalant tone of voice.\n\nSo  I\u2019m like \u201cwtf? You didn\u2019t figure to mention this before? Why am I  finding out like this?\u201d And she goes \u201cI don\u2019t owe you every single  detail of my life\u201d\n\nAnd I kinda  just froze while staring at her. Didn\u2019t know what to say. This isn\u2019t how  she normally speaks. The whole thing seemed so bizarre. I couldn\u2019t wrap  my head around it at all, she has major guilt about who pays for dates  but she hid having a kid like it\u2019s nothing?? I guess my staring made her  uncomfortable though, so she excused herself to the bathroom. While she  was gone, the more I thought about it the more I kept just getting  progressively angrier. So, mostly to avoid making a scene, I got up and  left. Leaving her with a 500-600$ bill + the uber ride home.\n\nI  expected a barrage of angry texts and calls on the way home, but no  just 1 message \u201cdid you seriously just get up and leave?\u201d Then this  morning a long message trying to explain things. At first I didn\u2019t  really feel any guilt at all. But now I\u2019m less angry, I\u2019m realizing she  probably doesn\u2019t even have the money for that dinner. Might end up  paying credit card interest for it for who knows how long. And it\u2019s her  kid who\u2019s ultimately gonna end up suffering for this. Which isn\u2019t fair  at all.

Jesus christ these people really need to fucking chill their balls. Leaving her with 600$ bill is nothing compared to everything he spent on her. Also she lied about having a kid. The first thing you need to tell someone you are dating is to say you have a kid and she hid that for 5 months.", "NTA-So lets see. This woman does all the planning in a new relationship and he doesn't think that's strange? She says she feels guilty but she's always broke. When he finds out that she's been hiding the fact that she is a single mom she's nasty about it. Why is the obvious so difficult to see? She was taking advantage of him as long as he was willing to let her. This is not unusual. He's been had. This woman was never interested in him, just his wallet. Now I don't agree with not paying the whole bill. I think he should have paid for his part of the meal by leaving the money on the table and then leaving the restaurant.", "NTA. Not telling you what your signing up for, 3-4 months into a relationship, is not okay. Not telling you she had a kid isn\u2019t a minor omission. I don\u2019t at all blame you for getting up and leaving. Or for saddling her with the bill. It was her choice to go there and from what you\u2019ve said there has been plenty of money spent on her already. Sure it could be damaging to her financially, but actions have consequences. That bill and the knowledge she messed up a good thing is hers.", "NTA!

At all. For many dating someone w kids is a dealbreaker.

I think she sucks for not telling you about the daughter. 5 months is entirely too long to be dating someone and not knowing that information.

She's been hiding that she has a whole ass child for 5 months? NTA-ESH because you didn't pay your half of the bill. So weird that she would drop that on you and expect you to take it well. She may not owe you every detail about her life but having a 12 year old daughter seems like a pretty big freaking deal.", "NTA\n\nYour reaction it's totally understandable. A kid it's not something you just hide when starting a relationship, some persons find it a dealbreaker and there's nothing bad about it.\n\nBut you could at least give her half the total of dinner + Uber driver to compensate for leaving like that.", "INFO: is this a sugar baby or MBR type set up?

I agree with those who say get her the money for the dinner.  I think you should pay for no other reason that it would be a loose end you are probably going to have to address eventually.  Make it your parting gift to her because her behavior shows she is most interested in your money, and I think it's time to move on.", "NTA", "Send her the money by e-transfer and move on.

That said, at least send her your half of the restaurant bill. Nta, but you do owe her that much.", "NTA - she was using you to pay for fancy dates, the fact you didn't know about her child at 4 months indicates she had no intention for a long term relationship.\n\nBy all means i can understand not have introducing you to her child, as that whole dynamic takes time and patience from all parties. But you were enough time and dates past the point where you should be on the same page relationship direction wise.", "Based on your reaction storming out of the restaurant with out telling her like a toddler throwing a tantrum that\u2019s probably why she didn\u2019t tell you because people can act like AH when they learn about someone they are dating having a kid whether it\u2019s the first couple dates or a few months. \nMaybe she wanted to see if what the two of you had was going to be serious.", "YTA She might have a reason for not bringing her kid into things. You took her out as a gift and reneged on your offer because of your own insecurities.", "NTA, I feel like when you are parent that is something that should be said right away. This doesn\u2019t mean you have to share every detail about the kid, but the person you are going on a date with needs to know. It isn\u2019t fair to them to be dating someone for 4-5 months and not even know their partner had a kid.", "Venmo her half the bill, and move on.  That\u2019s a pretty big secret to keep after 4-5 months.  And she didn\u2019t even try to tell you, her friend accidentally did!", "NTA for your reaction but send her the money for the meal.", "NTA but you should really ask if someone has or wants kids if you\u2019re planning on dating them long term especially if your knee jerk reaction is the be angry. \n\nGiven the negative stigma surrounding single mums/dads most keep it to themselves until they believe it\u2019s going somewhere or they\u2019re asked.\n\nAs for the guilt, she suggested the restaurant, she hid the truth, she got Comfortable living a lie.

If you bail her out she won\u2019t learn", "NTA for freezing and leaving to avoid making a scene, but YTA if you don't reimburse her for the meal and uber.", "ESH - You've been dating several months.  She should've disclosed that she's has a kid before that point.  Still, you know she can't afford that place and it was a gift. I think you should have still paid and then left.  Or at the least,  you should've left money to pay for the stuff you ate/drank.", "ESH. A child is not an insignificant detail. She was purposely  hiding that from you. I hear it is hard for single mothers to date or she might be extra protective so maybe she did it for reasons like that but it\u2019s been 4-5 months so she should have mentioned it by now. \n\nBut you leaving and not paying, on her birthday was a horrible thing to do. It was immature and rude. You need to work on your communication skills for one thing. The fact that you stormed out like a little baby shows that you might not be ready for a relationship. Stick to working and counting your cash.", "NTA", "ESH. While not introducing you to her child for 4-5 months might be reasonable, not letting you even know that she has a 12 year old child during that entire time is not normal behavior, and one wonders why she did this.\n\nYTA because part of the answer to that question is revealed when you describe your reaction as ANGER -- not shock, sadness, confusion, disappointment -- but anger. So angry, in fact, that you felt like you needed to leave in order to avoid making a scene in a public place.\n\nYou agreed to pay for a birthday dinner, and you should follow through on that promise. That shouldn't be predicated on whether she has a child or not.\n\nHowever, whether the relationship should continue is a different question for various reasons.", "It\u2019s tricky. Women are guarded about their kids when dating new men because who knows if the partner will end up being predatory or not? At the same time, 5 months is a considerable amount of time to be seeing someone without even mentioning it once, and maybe that information should\u2019ve been divulged sooner. I understand you being jarred by that news. However, for you to foot her with a $600 bill knowing she struggles to make ends meet was ultimately an asshole move. YTA", "Lol is this real? You knew the situation. ESH though because that long dating each other and she keeps that to herself the whole time? And then you just stick her with the bill over it? You could have gotten out of it with a not the asshole if you\u2019d paid anyway even though you were angry.", "I'm not getting why the 'do you have kids' question didn't come up before date 1. I wouldn't go out with someone who had a no kid policy, but totally understand the sentiment. I also wouldn't introduce a child to a casual relationship- but if the question was asked, I wouldn't deny the existence of my child.", "ESH. If you've been only dating for as you have, I can see her not wanting you to meet her kid yet, but not telling you seems kind of bizarre. What if you were at the point of asking her to move in, then you get \"oh, by the way, it's me and my kid\". It is however not cool to just get up and walk out without saying anything and leaving her with the bill. Obviously you both were seeing different things in the relationship.", "YTA for how you reacted. I am not sure I understand how you think not paying for dates is somehow equivalent to her having a daughter and not disclosing it. You basically walked out to have your \u201cthat will show her moment\u201d. Also 600 for one meal. Did they sprinkle everything with gold", "ESH she definitely should have told you about her kid especially since yall have been dating for 5 months which is crazy bc that should have been one the things she told yall before even going on a first date. you suck bc you couldv'e atleast paid for your stuff not bc shes a single mom (which we dont even really know) but bc she told you it was to pricey for her to go to alone so it was definitely too much if she had to cover your stuff and hers", "ESH\nJust wondering, if she had told you about her daughter would that have been an issue for you? Did you ever talk about not wanting kids or not liking kids? Maybe she was afraid to tell you. \nMaybe she didn\u2019t have custody, and was paying child support to her ex and that\u2019s why she was always broke. Maybe she was embarrassed by the situation. \nI feel like there is so much more to her reasoning and we all need to know why she kept the kid secret.", "ESH. She absolutely should have told you, 100%. I support the idea of introducing kids to a potential partner very soon into dating because if you and my kid don't get along this isn't going to work and I don't want to be in love before I find that out. And you know damn well you should not have left her with a bill she couldn't pay.", "ESH. It\u2019s understandable that you would be angry with her and feel deceived. Her not telling you she had a child, was a lie of omission on her part. \nBut disappearing while she was in the bathroom, and sticking her with such a large and unexpected dinner bill, on her birthday, was a bit assholesh and cowardly on your part. You really lost the high ground on that one.", "ESH. Her for not mentioning her child, you for leaving her with a bill she could likely not afford", "ESH. She lied by omission about Something Very Important for five months. You claim to not care about spending money yet left her with a huge unexpected bill, which is not a punishment that fits the crime. \n\nNo one handled this well. Thankfully, per your comment, you have since paid her back and now you both know this relationship is NOT compatible so you can leave each other alone forever.", "YTA. Being upset is fine. Each their own on if you should be. But the fact she didn't even mention it means she's not to that level of trust with you and I get that is upsetting. \n\nBut you walking out and sticking her with the bill you know she can't afford is lousy. She told you she's never been because she can't afford it, and you stuck her with double for two people. Pay for the meal, and decide what the future holds as a separate decision.", "YTA.

Wish her well. You date that long and don't disclose something that material...", "YTA for even thinking you might not be. That was a shit way to handle it and you never even got her side of why she didn't tell you.", "YTA for how you acted in response to the situation. It\u2019s totally a valid expectation to share something as major as having a kid with someone you are looking to be in a serious relationship with but you ditching her with a bill you KNOW she cannot afford reads as you kind of treating this as two wrongs making a right, which isn\u2019t true. You could have finished dinner and talked it over like two mature and responsible adults.", "YTA - You left a single mother to pay a $500 dinner tab, who you knew couldn't afford it, because you were upset?

I have no other words.", "ESH", "NAH. You should have been told. All she had to say was she wouldn\u2019t introduce anyone to her child until it was something serious and that she was ready.

Like text her \"I'm leaving, I need time to think about all of this\" and then send her the cash to pay for the bill and Uber. But honestly, I get why you reacted this way, you were obviously in shock and didn't think a lot before you acted.\n\nOn the other end, she should've mentioned she had a kid. I would want to know before getting attached because I wouldn't want to date someone with kids. You had a right to know and usually people put it on their dating profile because it weeds out the people that don't want kids and saves time. It wasn't fair of her to hide it for that long.", "ESH. If you guys are seriously dating, it\u2019s strange for her to never even mention a child. Not to say you should have met the kid by now, but to never mention it at all is odd.

Hiding that she has a kid was weird and you have every right to feel blindsided and weirded out, but skipping out on a bill that you agreed to pay and knew she couldn't afford wasn't the right way to express your anger.

Block her and never contact this woman again. \n\nLet\u2019s be real, she didn\u2019t tell you about the kid because dating a single woman and dating a single mom are two different things to men.  Her defensive attitude to a reasonable question shows she knew she was wrong.  She got caught.\n\nParenthood is something a responsible adult discloses from day 1.  She is ashamed of disclosing this because other guys she liked probably passed on her because she had a kid.  The major guilt is either a tactic to make you think she isn\u2019t a gold digger or to explain she may not have as much money as you might think because she has the hidden expense of a freaking child!  \n\nSo either she was using you for money now OR hoping to get you so attached to her that when she did disclose her child you would overlook it to become a stepdad later.\n\nDo not overlook this, her behavior shows her values, character and how she sees you.  You were angry because this is insulting.  Her behavior is shameful, deceptive and manipulative.  You have every right to be angry.  She was lying about who she is to you from the beginning.  You cannot trust whatever persona she has been sharing because it was a lie and anything she does now will be in order to manipulate you to excuse her behavior.\n\nMove on my friend.  You deserve better than this.", "NTA you don\u2019t have a girlfriend. You have a sugar baby.", "Awkward all over \ud83d\ude02", "NTA. You may not notice the manipulation because she's good at it. All the \"I'm so broke\" and being apologetic and worrying and guilt.... fake. She knows you're a nice guy and that she's saying the things that will make you feel good about paying for everything. \n\nNo need to pay for the meal. Her kid won't suffer because somebody else is obviously taking care of her, I assume it's the dad.", "Yup.  Venmo the money and move on.", "Pay for your portion of the bill and move on.", "Definitely NTA. She lied to you for months, and from the sounds of things she willingly accepted a ton of money from you the whole time. Having to pay $500 sounds like she got off easy. You owe her nothing.", "NTA. Having a kid is something that needs to be discussed at the beginning. That's just ridiculous.", "NTA; but you aren't excused for leaving her with the bill. You could have paid your half at least! But GF is a liar....no wonder why she said she's always broke cause it's two mouths vs. one", "NTA but I'd send her your half of the dinner atleast then move on, not sharing such a huge part of her life is a massive red flag and then having such an odd reaction, I just can't find a way where it makes sense other than she was using you.", "I\u2019m kind of surprised by all the NTA comments\u2026 Did she say WHY she didn\u2019t tell you about her daughter? Based off of her age, and her daughters age, she was fairly young when her daughter was born\u2026 maybe her daughter doesn\u2019t live with her and she\u2019s ashamed of that? Maybe her daughter is I\u2019ll and she isn\u2019t ready to share that part of her life yet? Hell, maybe she just doesn\u2019t want to share that part of her life yet. So therefore yea, YTA. Walking away was just rude.", "NAH. Venmo her for the meal and you\u2019re square. That makes sense why she doesn\u2019t have money to spare. \n\nI get you being upset, I really do\u2026but it\u2019s cannot overstate the sheer ridiculous amount of men that prey on women just to get to their kids. Seriously, the \u201cmom\u2019s creepy boyfriend/husband\u201d stereotype girls talk about when they\u2019re older? Some days it feels like an absolute miracle to find girl\u2019s in that scenario that wasn\u2019t molested. I\u2019ve worked with enough sexual assault victims to say that I would probably never date as a single mother, not until my child is fully grown and out of the place. \ud83d\ude2d I will never be able to fault a single mom for hiding the existence of their children if they\u2019re risking dating. I just keep seeing it over and over. So many predators specifically target moms. It\u2019s terrifying.", "NTA. You're way more gentlemanly to leave cash for her. In that circumstance, you're free to leave.", "I think what you did was a bit harsh, but she\u2019s not in the clear whatsoever. I would have gone on with the date, then just break up with her afterwards. Not leave her there with the check, which you already mentioned you feel bad about it. If it was me, I\u2019d offer to Venmo the money for dinner and goodbye.", "NTA, I think you should of stuck her with the bill personally.", "Eh, NAH. I think you are fine being hurt but many single parents keep their kids a secret so child predators don\u2019t pick them on purpose trying to get to the kids.", "NTA. While it's perfectly normal to not meet someone's kid right away, she certainly owed it to you to tell you that she had a daughter!!!", "NTA.  Not mentioning your kid in 4-5 months of dating?  Big red flag.  I understand some people don\u2019t want to date a single parent, and maybe she just wanted to have fun, but this is not ok.

We met  online and initially, everything went great. Except one thing...\n\nWe  got this deal going where she plans everything and I pay for  everything. I spend most of my time working so her planning for stuff is  actually a huge bonus to me. + I make a LOT more money than she does so  her paying doesn\u2019t really make sense. But still she kept feeling guilty  and saying she\u2019s definitely gonna pay for one of these dates eventually  but \u201cjust so broke right now\u201d. I told her several times that I actually  like this setup...stop worrying about it...makes no difference to me  who pays for dinner...financial support is not something I require in a  partner whatsoever. But still no matter what I said she kept feeling  guilty about it. I kinda thought maybe it\u2019s cuz she has a pretty decent  job so she should NOT be broke but probably has poor money management  skills so maybe feels a little ashamed for it or something along those  lines.\n\nAnyway, her birthday comes  and I just straight up asked her if she wanted anything for it. She  mentioned this restaurant she\u2019s been wanting to go to for a while but  it\u2019s pricey so she never has...and it\u2019s not a big deal if we don\u2019t go  but blah blah blah\n\nI made  reservations and we\u2019re at the place, everything\u2019s going fine till some  friend of hers walks in, notices her and stops by to say hi. During that  conversation the friend asks about her daughter...At first I thought it  was some kind of an inside joke or something but nope...they really  were talking about her daughter which I had no idea existed till now.\n\nThe friend finally leaves and I ask her \u201cyou have kids?\u201d\n\nShe goes \u201cyeah I have a daughter she\u2019s 12 her name is...\u201d In a really non nonchalant tone of voice.\n\nSo  I\u2019m like \u201cwtf? You didn\u2019t figure to mention this before? Why am I  finding out like this?\u201d And she goes \u201cI don\u2019t owe you every single  detail of my life\u201d\n\nAnd I kinda  just froze while staring at her. Didn\u2019t know what to say. This isn\u2019t how  she normally speaks. The whole thing seemed so bizarre. I couldn\u2019t wrap  my head around it at all, she has major guilt about who pays for dates  but she hid having a kid like it\u2019s nothing?? I guess my staring made her  uncomfortable though, so she excused herself to the bathroom. While she  was gone, the more I thought about it the more I kept just getting  progressively angrier. So, mostly to avoid making a scene, I got up and  left. Leaving her with a 500-600$ bill + the uber ride home.\n\nI  expected a barrage of angry texts and calls on the way home, but no  just 1 message \u201cdid you seriously just get up and leave?\u201d Then this  morning a long message trying to explain things. At first I didn\u2019t  really feel any guilt at all. But now I\u2019m less angry, I\u2019m realizing she  probably doesn\u2019t even have the money for that dinner. Might end up  paying credit card interest for it for who knows how long. And it\u2019s her  kid who\u2019s ultimately gonna end up suffering for this. Which isn\u2019t fair  at all.

Who suggests someone take them to a restaurant where dinner for two would be $600 when they would never ever be able to reciprocate.  He left because he felt used.\n\nThe fact that he is concerned that her child might suffer because he stuck her with the bill is the clear sign that he is a nice guy.  I do hope he Venmos her the money and moves on. This girl is an idiot and ruined a good thing because she was not honest.", "Why the full amount?

She doesn\u2019t need to introduce OP to her child on any sort of time frame, but telling him she has a child before he paid for all of those dates is definitely common decency.

That\u2019s a choice.", "I agree with the paying part. It doesn't matter if you spent thousands on her all these months, OP. Please be the decent guy we think you are and pay your half and be done with her.\n\nAlso, if she wants to be petty she may bad mouth you saying you ran out after you learned she had a kid, or you left a single mom with a $600 bill when she has this and this bill coming, and so on.

She hid a child, she could certainly lie about her financial status.", "Oh! Interesting take. I can see where you are coming from. When I was at my poorest, my credit cards were maxed.

I would have been calling relentlessly trying to get OP back to pay.", "No, we met on Bumble. If it was...no one told me about it. Pretty sure that it was not tho.", "Fyi in the comments he already paid her back for it.\n\nBut i would ask, who is comfortable asking someone to take them on a date to a 300 dollar per person meal\u2026 and not even mention they have kids.

As far as being protective - you don\u2019t have to introduce a dating partner to your child early in, but the dating partner should know about the existence of said child. \n\nThe ex-gf was clearly using OP - and for several months - which completely outweighs the inappropriateness of walking out on the date.

ESH", "It's not the fact that she has a kid, it's that he's invested almost a year and probably thousands of dollars into a relationship without the necessary information to decide whether he wanted to or not.

Leaving a situation to cool down when you feel angry is the RIGHT thing to do. \n\nThis guy has been paying for a bunch of dates for months and found out that he's basically a sugar daddy to a woman who's been lying to him for months.

Am I just supposed to ask every woman I ever date...hey btw I know u never mentioned a single thing about this but do u randomly have a kid??", "I guess my point of view is a little bit different on this. Most single moms I have encountered would never get into a relationship with and waste their time with someone just to find out months later they don\u2019t or didn\u2019t want children. In my experience a decent parent would bring this up within a few weeks at most. Something like \u201cListen I have a kid that depends on me and they are and will be my main focus, I like us and where things are going but needed to check and see if this is something that you can be a part of because if not I don\u2019t have the time to waste.\u201d I\u2019m not saying he should have met her daughter but her existence at least should have been mentioned. As for leaving and sticking her with the bill. That was a bit over the top and you should have paid for your half.

And this is a common thing from what I hear from my friends. \n\nNetflix and chill every night is boring yes\u2026 but sometimes finding someone where maybe just going for a walk, the museum, or a local pub is better for a lot of relationships\u2026.making the normal things seem like more than enough without the \u201cfluff\u201d needing to be there every date. \n\nJust my humble opinion- each to their own though. \n\nGood on you for tying up the lose ends before walking away.", "Wait\u2026are you staying with this woman?", "Bumble profiles usually say if someone has/wants kids... if her profile didn't display that info then why didn't you ask her ?", "It can def be hard for single moms to date, source: I am one. But I tell everyone right away I have a kid. Even if it's just a FWB, cause that changes availability and location of dates amongst other things. Kiddo only meets people I'm getting serious about. I don't need a step dad but having a companion that at least gets along with my kid until things progress is non-negotiable. Why waste my time or someone's feelings?? I don't need a free dinner that badly.", "The game plan is \u201cf I get him to love me first, I\u2019ll be able to spring this surprise on him and he will be too emotionally tied to me to leave.\u201d I mean I\u2019d call that emotional manipulation but what do I know", "When men wonder how the patriarchy harms them, this is the clearest first answer. You guys aren't allowed to feel your feelings from such a young age and the toll of that is immense. It also leads into so many toxic behaviours towards others and yourselves. The idea that men are less emotional both discounts anger as an emotion and limits you unfairly from experiencing your full humanity. I'm glad you figured this one out, you're doing better than most", "Unfortunately, pedophiles seek out women with kids and fake relationships with them for an extended amount of time in order to win the woman's trust and be given access to her children. \n\nI wish it were as simple as \"be open about it if you have kids before the first date\" but it's just not. Granted 5 months is definitely too long before mentioning the kids thing. \n\nI don't have kids so I don't have to worry about \"when to break the news\" but if I did, I'd err on the side of \"this guy thinks I'm an asshole for hiding my kid.\" Protecting children is more important in this case.", "I mean you don\u2019t tend to lead with the fact that you have a 12 year old daughter on your dating profile\u2026I mean I guess some people do, but a lot of people are more protective of their children than that. You really don\u2019t know what kind of people are out there and what they\u2019re after. \n\nHad you never been to her home? After 4-5 months I would think you\u2019d been there and clearly there would be signs of a child living there\u2026", "Yes.  Yes you are. \n\nIt's not random.\n\nAlso suggest asking if prospective dates have any STDs- you know, in case they don't want to put that on a dating app profile.", "Yes, how else would you know?", "Yes- this is the 'rational' way to contemplate the subject matter at hand. Sadly, online dating is not always rational. \n\nFor example, back when match dot com was first a thing, 'I'll tell you later' was a given response:\n\nKids? I'll tell you later: could mean infertile, vasectomy, I'm octomom, or I have several of whom I lost custody.\n\nReligion? I'll tell you later: I'm a member of Seaorg, I'm an atheist, or I recently started my own church.\n\nOccupation? I play video games/ collect comic books and live in my parents' basement, or I'm a gazillionaire having trouble dating...\n\nYou get the idea- Can't judge the situation here, because I don't know the details of the 'relationship- sounds a bit contrite, as letting someone plan many dates while having the expectation to pay for them seems odd, but hell- the best... escorts are those who truly make the person paying for their services feel like they are the one and only client- not saying that is what happened here, all I'm saying is that online dating can be scary AF, and all parties need to practice due diligence to avoid getting hurt, scammed, or whatever. \n\nSounds like his perception of her was crushed- feeling is valid and justified- as is hers, for perhaps not wanting to ruin a nice time/ good thing- no way of knowing without more context.", "Yeah within the first few weeks sounds the smartest. It's tough because pedophiles with absolutely fake interest in women to get access to their kids, even if they have to wait a while to meet the kids.... So as much as it seems easiest to disclose immediately so as not to waste anyone's time... the kids' safety is much more important. \n\nStill, 5 months seems way too long.", "Degustation is easily 250 per person, 50 for paired wine would be on the cheap side tbh. Agreed that this is extravagant but not at all unrealistic for a fancy place", "There is nothing to believe here, what she sent you was mostly a lie. The true part is her deleting the tag of \"single mother\" to get better hits, but as far as planning on telling you, she never was going to. \n\nBlock her and move on, she is not worth dwelling on.", "I'll chime in on your question. It slightly swings the money aspect in your favor, but also you made many reassurances to her, supposedly, that you didn't care about paying for everything so it's not a massive factor. Fwiw I don't think you're the AH for your reaction, and glad to see you sent her the money (though I hope it was only for your half)", "What you did at that dinner was reactionary to the situation. There was no good ending to that night. If you stayed, you would have been writing a post on AITA for \"how I reacted when my gf told me she had a 12-year-old kid.\" \n\nI don't think you are TA because, after 5 months, that news is shocking,at best... heartbreaking at worst for the deceit. \n\nThe questions running through your head mist have been awful in that moment. You put so much toward a relationship for her to lie to you this whole time. \n\nHow you reacted was honest. It may have hurt someone, but it's not always your job to protect someone else. Sometimes, you have to protect yourself. Whether other people think that makes you the asshole is irrelevant. You did what you had to do.", "\nYou're right, it's a messed up thing to do. The only situation under which I can justify her NOT telling you is if she has no relationship with the kid, which clearly isn't the case here. \n\nBut we're not talking about your relationship overall, we're talking about whether you're wrong for leaving her with a $600 bill for a dinner you agreed to pay for when, as far as you know, she *can't* pay it and it seems to be nbd for you. \n\nIn your shoes, I'd have paid the bill and never spoken to her again. Not because she has a kid, because she lied for 5 months about a whole human being that presumably lives with her. \n\nI'm actually really curious about that. Did you never go to her house or discuss finances? Not that you're to blame for not knowing, I'm honestly just curious how that even happens. I can't imagine knowing anyone for 5 months and not talking about my kids.", "That's because that wasn't the expectation for *that dinner.*  It wasn't that it was \"1 meal for me\" -- it's that it was \"1 meal for you that was a surprise.\"  And yes, she surprised you with the kid thing, which you also didn't like. So, two wrongs, etc... That's why ESH.  Say that person came up and asked about the daughter right after you paid the bill -- would you have asked for it back and then refused to pay?  Would you have asked her for her half of the dinner right then?  That's why nobody is mentioning it.", "What do you mean? I'm the one who broke HER trust in your view??", "No it absolutely isn\u2019t. There are men that date women with kids to have access to kids. I would never advertise being a mother until I knew for certain said man wasn\u2019t a creep. And that takes times.", "The only reason I said he was an asshole is because he planned on paying all along.\n\nBut in the grand scheme of things, he is definitely not the asshole in the situation taken as a whole.", "I mean, that's a pretty standard first date question", "I agree, it\u2019s lying by omission.\n\nDid the kids conversation never come up? It\u2019s usually one of the first date type questions. As you say, the child must be a huge part of her life, how can she be honest with you about her lifestyle etc without mentioning her daughter?", "How does that justify walking out on your portion of the bill?", "And you left her with $$$ bill she might not be able to pay for because you found out about her having a kid. You run out because she has a kid, simple as.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI stand by my comment. YTA", "Have you ever thought about WHY she wouldn\u2019t say something? A lot of child advocates warn against revealing you have children when you enter into a new relationship. Predators look for single mothers for easy access.", "and you're right for that assumption it's absolutely crazy that she didn't tell you that", "Your assumption is absolutely reasonable, how after 5 months did she think this would get broken to you in a good way?? Even if you didn\u2019t hear about it from a 3rd party I think it still would of been a hard pill to swallow. I know people that move in together after 6-8months was she just gonna let you know your office would be a bedroom for her daughter when they happened. It\u2019s ridiculous to assume everyone is gonna ask if you have kids.", "Agree", "I think him paying for everything WAS the most important thing in her life; the child seems like an afterthought if she was okay hiding her for months.", "I stand corrected!  I agree with you.", "On the other hand, if she mentions she has a kid, it could set her up to being pressured by him to be introduced to the kid before she or the kid feel ready for that.", "That is not what I am saying at all. Obviously, kids are a HUGE portion of a relationship and whether or not you want to have them, want to raise someone else's, or even want that as an aspect of your lifestyle, is an important topic. \n\nInstead, what I am saying is that maybe she had not made that decision at just five months in and thus had not felt it was a relivent conversation at this point in their relationship. \n\nThat is not to say that this wasn't unfair to OP, I am just saying that it is not always so black and white. \n\nAdditionally, far more context would be needed to address whether she was truly the asshole here. If she was all in and in a full blown relationship with op, where they were planning their lives together and she was low key raising a god damn teenager by herself, without disclosing, and he had no idea (like how???) Yea, she is the asshole. But, again, how could that even happen? Kids are full time, no matter the age.", "I don't care about people's judgement lol. + I wanted her to stick her with the bill (I paid for 5 months worth of dates under false pretenses, which no one seems to care about).\n\nOnly sent the money afterwards because I didn't want her daughter to suffer on account of me.", "No. It\u2019s completely normal for a parenting plan to have a requirement that you can\u2019t introduce kids to a new partner for 6 months, etc. It is not normal and I have never seen a parenting plan that says one parent can\u2019t tell a new partner about their children. That would be a gag order, and courts don\u2019t put gag orders in place except in extreme circumstances:", "Do such stipulations include not even mentioning the person has a kid? But then again, I can see how going, \"I have two kids but I can't talk about them with you, per my divorce agreement\" would also be awkward.", "Hell no lol. I meant in future as in with other people.", "You can\u2019t be serious lol", "Yeah this. It feels like at least a second date nugget of information. I want people to be upfront with me so I don't waste any time. It honestly sounds like she was just using him.", "Spent a lot of time reading psychology books and attending self improvement courses because I couldn\u2019t cope with being angry all the time. \n\nOn the flip side if a man cries in-front of anyone not just other men they get mocked. Ex partners would mock \u201ccall yourself a man\u201d if eyes watered up. Let alone an actual tear and if you open up about feelings it\u2019s met with a tug of war of who has it worse ultimately making most guys shut up and go back to internalising", "Heck of a reach to not call a woman TA there. For one, knowingly giving someone an std is a crime. And I'm sorry, but it's on the parent to disclose their status as a parent. Just as its on someone with aids to tell any prospective partners that detail.", "Are we also supposed to ask whether they\u2019re a serial killer, whether they\u2019ve committed arson before, whether their parents love them, if they\u2019ve ever thought about having a midget gangbang? Common sense is really lacking around here.", "I picked her up at her place several times, but never went in passed the living room. Her daughter was never there when I was.\n\nI offered to help her with finances before (teach her how to invest money, manage expenses etc) but she kept postponing that talk. I didn't want to be pushy cuz I thought it's a very personal thing and it's normal she doesn't wanna show expenses to someone else etc. \n\n\\+I'm not from a rich family or anything. I just work a lot and learned how to invest wisely over the years. But that takes up most of my time and energy throughout the day...so not a lot of time to be poking through other people's lives. I don't have social media, she did but accounts were set to private the one time I looked and I didn't bother with it further. I was pretty open with her about all elements of my life...guess I just thought she'd reciprocate. So didn't try to pry any further.", "The absolute bottom least was to pay for your own meal.

Maybe a month...but no.", "Four-five months though?", "I always go by the fact she allowed him to always pay for things knowing he was fully invested but she didn\u2019t feel she owed him anything.

I'm open to dating someone who has kids...at my age a lot of women do. It's the lying for so long that made me want to leave. How am I supposed to trust someone who keeps a secret like that??\n\nAlso I paid literally several thousands of dollars for meals and events during that time...not that I regret it, or anything like that I'm just curious about your opinion. Does that matter at all? Is it that terrible of a thing if in the course of 5 months she paid for 1 meal for me essentially (more than half that tab was her food n drink).
