As an adult, my bday is very important to me bc I grew up in a Jehovah Witness household and my birthday was never celebrated. \n\nSo I tend to over compensate for my inner child that never got the cake or party.\n\nI have spent 8 birthdays with my bf (27M) now and he has never done anything special for me. We usually go to dinner where I chip in for half of the expenses. No gifts. Nothing. \n\nMeanwhile I go as far as planning his celebrations, paying for everything, and listening to him talk about the things he wants throughout the year (so I can appropriately gift him).\n\nI am always tasked with planning my own celebrations (which I typically do not mind b/c like the saying goes, if you want something done right, do it yourself). \n\nBut sometimes it leaves me feeling like he does not care enough to plan anything for me because he hasn\u2019t shown or taken the initiative (this is something that I have communicated and expressed for years).\n\nOn top of that, it has become an annual tradition of sorts for him to argue with me the entire week leading up to my birthday about plans he\u2019s known about for months. This year is no different.\n\nThis week he picked a fight with me because I purchased a $35 outfit from SHEIN for my birthday dinner. His angle was that I\u2019m going to look good and he\u2019d look homeless. His fix to this problem? Purchasing a $400 suit.\n\nBut now he\u2019s complaining about the cost of dinner (which is no more than $180 and I assured him that I\u2019d chip in for it). He\u2019s went as far as ignoring me all week bc of this (Valentine\u2019s Day being the only exception) and making it a point to argue about it during our limited conversations this week.\n\nHe then proceeded to back out of my plans altogether yesterday and told me to invite my girls to go with me. Which I typically wouldn\u2019t mind doing. But I respect my friends\u2019 time enough to not throw last minute plans at them considering they have their own lives. \n\nAlso this restaurant is popular and one that it really takes a miracle to get reservations at (hence booking in advance)\n\nThat was the last straw for me. So I ended up canceling our reservations and i used the money I\u2019ve saved up to celebrate myself to book a solo round trip plane ticket to Puerto Rico to enjoy my birthday in the sun.\n\nMy bf is now mad at me and claiming we should break up bc of my trip.
