But that\u2019s probably because I would have been just as bewildered as you and gotten mad at her and my mood would have been ruined by the time I realized it was flirting. \n\nNTA", "She was flirting... she was trying to flirt", "I honesty think the nurse has a crush on you! AWWWW!", "For the love of kittens and puppies, ask her out!  \nNAH, just heavy flirting!", "Ummm, you read this entirely wrong. Go take her for coffee and you might have it figured out by the end.", "INFO: you gonna make reddit's day and ask her out??", "I was about to call you a freakin dumbass! LMFAO h this is hilarious! OP you\u2019re NTA but holy fucking hell you\u2019re an oblivious dumbass! LMFAO", "I'd have taken her at face value. The fact I was a doctor meant she felt she was being judged and was uncomfortable with that. That I should have treated the child myself even though without first aid kit. I don't think I'd have been comfortable going near her again. And was that a tip she wanted? Whole situation just very uncomfortable.", "I used to live with a lesbian friend a couple of decades ago and I remember her telling me \"oh by the way, me and Jane are dating now\", and I was like, ... now????? You mean to tell me that this woman who's stayed over every night for the last 3 weeks, who's been snuggling up to you on the settee when we watch Coronation Street, whose dressing gown is hanging up on the back of our bathroom door ... only *now* are you dating?", "Plot twist: That\u2019s why Sophie \u201ctripped\u201d in the first place.", "Yeah but if this was a dude telling a woman that she owes him and she can make it up to him some other way?? You know damn well this wouldn't be the response. \n\nCome on this is horseshit lol.", ">red as a tomato silent yelling into oblivion.\n\nI love this, thank you so much. I wish my mom was still alive, this would bother tickle and suit her beautifully lmao", "I\u2019m autistic and couldn\u2019t. After looking at the comment section, I facepalmed so hard.", "I\u2019m so bad at interpreting tone over text so in my head she was saying \u201cproperly make it up to her\u201d in a very menacing and threatening way. Like I thought OP was being extorted by an elementary school nurse at first!!! LMAO", "It should be written into law that you give the plug when someone compliments you on them. It\u2019s a girls girl thing ya know?", "All the comments here would be \u201cwhat a creep\u201d and \u201cyou should get him fired. Go right to the school board, the fact that he thinks you \u2018owe\u2019 him something. Men \ud83d\ude44\u201d", "I\u2018m not autistic and I couldn\u2019t tell.", "In some world I would consider feeling bad for this. But in this one men are predatory.", "Yep lol exactly. Reddit has this weird obsession with misogyny and wants to insert it into every scenario too", "I was like \u201cwhy is she being so weird? Why the fuck would she insist OP owed her?\u201d LOL", ">  mall security girlfriend with a total butch look was gay.\n\nNever safe to assume with this. My partner and I are both stereotypically femme. My best friend works in a steelworks, has lived in chequered shirts with a buzzcut for 20 years and is straight as a girder. I've taken her flowers when she was having a shitty time lol. \n\nWomen are so good at sharing emotions with each other that we can get stuck knowing which is which. Should be a quiz show with audience participation. Platonic or romantic? You decide!", "Ok OP wrote that she's single bisexual and nurse has a chance, yay, OP update us pls, this is so cute \ud83e\udd29", "...I think the nurse wants to bang you.", "NTA, she was trying to flirt.\n\n2 Scenerios\n\nShe was trying to find an opening to flirt from the beginning.\n\nShe hear your profession and saw dollar signs.\n\nHoping it was the first one.", "I read the entire post and until I read the threads and comments evn I didn't realise OP was being hit on.. I'm autistic, nonbinary, demi ace, and pan.. omg I didn't even realise..!! \ud83d\ude2d  I'm probably dense I genuinely thought the nurse was being mean \ud83d\ude02", "NTA, but honestly not impressed with the flirting. And all of these comments about asking her out?! Why?", "BABE SHE WAS FLIRTING", "op=NTA\n\nI realize I'm not privy to jer tone, but by comments--I feel like the Nurse was making a pass at you.\n\nDid she say how you were supposed to make it up to her?", "LOL!!! I saw the typo & thought this was going to be about lice. \ud83d\ude04", "r/actuallesbians", "No", "OP, /gen are you possibly autistic bc I am and it flew over my head too lol", "Nope, you let the nurse do her job.", "Was she hitting on you?", "Update!", "NT...and they've already moved in together.", "I\u2019m so glad I wasn\u2019t the only one thinking this \ud83d\ude05! Really thought I wasn\u2019t using my grown up brain cells \ud83d\ude1d.", "I was cracking up by the time I got to the end. That is so me I never know when someone is flirting with me.", "Was she joking or flirting was my first thoughts as well!", "Lesbians are notorious for being oblivious to flirting.", "I don't know why but I read this in Barbossa's voice", "I believe the nurse was actually hitting on her", "Muthafucka sounds like Starbucks drink lmao.  \"Hey yo lemme get a non-binary demi ace pan, venti please.\"", "Why are we assuming OP is gay?", "Would be even better of she had the realization years after marrying him. Just some random Sunday morning: Oh my god, is he into me?", "In our defense, women give each other compliments all the time! How are we meant to pick them apart?!", "Lol best reply ever, I am now officially a drink \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\ud83d\udc9b\ud83e\udd0d\ud83d\udc9c\ud83d\udda4", "Always said kids are the best wingmen ! \ud83d\ude02", "It's also common with those who just aren't looking for a date.  I'm married and my friends laugh when people 'openly' flirt with me as it just goes right over my head.  I'm smiley and polite and there are times my friends have to point it out as the other person hasn't realised I'm not getting it and I just think they're person being chatty and polite.  Penny never drops on it's own.", "\nWhy would you hope she queer just because she's being flirted with? Like legitimately I don't understand.", "As someone who doesn't get flirting and once discovered that a university friend had had a crush on me a full decade after he assumed I knew and wasn't interested, it really isn't \"pure\", it's a fucking pain in the neck.", "Haha I didn't expect this to get this much attention to be honest. By the way sorry I took so long to answer I was busy all day. To answer your question, well I am in fact bisexual", "I'm so glad you can take a joke. Have a happy life homie!", "Because it would be a cute ending to the story if they dated.", "It\u2019s a common thing for LWLL. We NEVER notice it when someone is chatting us up.", "I hope you're queer", "Are you in a relationship and does the nurse stand a chance?", "When I first realized I wasn't straight, I sorta thought back and realized I've definitely been hit on by very attractive women before lol.", "You know what else would be a cute ending to the story. They have dinner as friends, and create a stronger bonding friendship that's platonic and not sexual. \n\nThings don't have to end in romance.\n\nAnd I'm not against LGBTQ I just don't understand why you would actively HOPE someone was a particular sexuality in order to fulfill your fantasy.", "It's like that one classic post where someone with a lesbian pfp says \"So this girl says she wants to kiss me and that she really likes me, and wants to go to a vegan caf\u00e9 together. Is this a date????\"", "The fuck is a LWLL why must reddit make everything an acronym.", "No and yes", "Omg, chill.", "u/glassholeshitfuck you sound super bitter and weird.", "Boo, tomatoes tomatoes tomatoes \ud83c\udf45\ud83c\udf45\ud83c\udf45\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5", "Jesus Christ, talk about having zero sense of humor, are you okay? \"IM NOT AGAINST LGBTQ...\" honey, are you sure?", "You\u2019re goofy", "Contextually id presume it means Lady who likes ladies", "IDK", "What.", "Same!

I never thought that I would see a meet cute in aita. This is making my day much better.", "Either works"]}
