There, I met this girl named Reese (23f). We share a lot of the same interests and we became pretty good friends. \n\nFor the past month or so, Reese has been on the hunt for a new job since her current one has abysmal pay. She finally got an interview, but about 4 days ago, her car broke down and she had to take it to the shop. Because of this, she asked me to drive her to the interview and I agreed since her apartment and her interview site are both within 15 minutes of my apartment. \n\nOn the day of the interview (2 days ago), I drove to Reese\u2019s building and she got in the car and everything seemed okay. However, when I was pulling out of the parking lot, I noticed she wasn\u2019t wearing her seatbelt. Since I\u2019m uncomfortable driving people without seatbelts, I asked her to put it on, thinking she just forgot. But when I said that, she told me she doesn\u2019t wear seatbelts. I immediately stopped the car and told her she needed to put it on and the car would not be moving while she wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt. Reese got upset and said that her uncle died in a car accident because he got twisted up in his seatbelt and wasn\u2019t able to get out of the car before it exploded, so she doesn\u2019t wear a seatbelt for \u201csafety reasons.\u201d I felt terrible for her, but I stood firm and said I didn\u2019t want to get a fine for her not wearing her seatbelt. Furthermore, if we got in an accident and she got hurt because she wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt, I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself. \n\nReese only got more upset and said it was only a 15 minute drive and the chances of us getting into an accident are so low, so it doesn\u2019t matter. She also said she\u2019s a grown woman and I can\u2019t control what she does. I said that\u2019s true, but I\u2019m also a grown woman and I can choose whether or not I want to drive my car, and if she wasn\u2019t going to wear a seatbelt, I wasn\u2019t going to drive her. \n\nWe argued for a little bit more before I told her she can get an Uber if she feels so strongly about it. Reese called me an asshole and got out of my car and I just left. \n\nShe later texted me and said that she ended up being late for her interview, and now because of me, she wasn\u2019t going to get the job. I told her that all she had to do was put on a seatbelt and she made herself late. She responded that I wasn\u2019t being understanding of her trauma and I\u2019m a controlling bitch. So now I\u2019m having second thoughts. I don\u2019t know, should I have just bitten the bullet and driven her?", "created_utc": 1687107309, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14cp8au/aita_for_refusing_to_drive_my_friend_while_she/", "score": 320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You've clearly displayed respect for Reese's traumatic experience, yet safety in a vehicle isn't something to compromise. The rules around seatbelt use aren't meant to control us, but to protect us. It's unfortunate that Reese views your concern for safety as a controlling behavior. Maybe, if you feel up to it, a heart-to-heart conversation with Reese could help clear the air. Express why you stood your ground about the seatbelt and assure her that it was not about asserting control but ensuring safety. If she still can't grasp your viewpoint, it might be worth considering the future of this friendship.

If you get pulled over, you pay the ticket. Those aren't cheap.", "Nta. The most ridiculous thing to me is that, she said she doesn't wear them because she's worried about getting tangled in it during an accident (as she knows someone it happened to) but when you said if you're in an accident you don't want her getting hurt. Her argument was that 15 minutes means it's unlikely to be in an accident. Which then makes her point invalid as well.", "nta", "First responder, and when the call says \"driver ejected\"  its always bad and almost always fatal.", "I was in a very bad accident 3 blocks from my house when I was t-boned by a driver speeding through a stop sign. I had severe and permanent injuries. But since I was wearing my seat belt I was not dead.", "NTA. like you said, you need to provide the best life you possibly can for your daughter,", "I have one of these.  It lives in the otherwise useless sunglasses holder in my car so both the driver and the passenger can reach it easily.", "FYI it was actually Volvo!", "It\u2019s Volvo who invented the 3 point seat belt and gave it for free not VW", "Where I live if the person is over 18 its them that gets the fine, not the driver.", "In Canada the passenger gets it if they're 16 or older.", "I\u2019m so sorry! That\u2019s insane and so tragic.", "NTA Additionally: If you are not wearing a seatbelt, then you are a danger to EVERYONE ELSE in the vehicle. In the event of an accident, your body becomes a 150+ pound projectile. \n\nEver been kicked/punched by someone? Now imagine getting hit in the face by someone\u2019s foot flying at 80 miles an hour because they were flung from their seat.\n\nThis goes for pets too. They make special seatbelts for dogs/backseat nets, that can not only save the dog\u2019s life, but also prevent serious injury or death to other passengers. \n\nEvery occupant of a personal vehicle should be wearing a seatbelt.", "The audacity of getting in someone's car and refusing to wear a seat belt where its LEGALLY required. Also, her license and car her rules. NTA. I am also a nurse, your lucky if you reach the hospital if you weren't wearing a seat belt.", "I know someone like this. My husband\u2019s cousin was in a car accident, his girlfriend was wearing a seatbelt but he wasn\u2019t. His girlfriend was killed, but somehow he survived. Now he believes that wearing a seatbelt is dangerous and refuses to wear one. I don\u2019t mention anything because I know he\u2019s traumatized, but I don\u2019t even know how someone could convince him otherwise.", "I won't turn on the engine until everyone has their seat belt fastened.", "What happened is very low probability. Serious injury without the seatbelt is much more likely", "Imagine someone asking you for a favor and then when you say \"okay but can you wear a seatbelt\" they call you a controlling bitch lmao", "Same here about not even putting it gear. Hell I put in a belt to change parking spots at a mall.", "In places I\u2019ve lived back seat passengers are not required to wear a seatbelt - but my 2021 Fiat will light up if it senses a passenger with no belt \u2014 dinging in the front because it\u2019s illegal - yellow light on the dashboard if in the back", "And another: https://youtu.be/mKHY69AFstE\n\nHuman bodies launched at high speed at other human bodies can and do kill them.", "Good for you for standing your ground here.", "You\u2019re more likely to get in an accident in slower traffic areas than you are more familiar with and usually the smaller commutes than your longer, higher speed travel. \n\nHigh speed travel collisions result in much more serious injury, however seatbelts help make the collisions in lower speed environments much less threatening as well. \n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA. Also, she needs to get a grip because even taxi services and chauffer services require seatbelts due to their insurances and state laws.", "It is illegal to not wear a seatbelt in the US. You get ticketed and fined if you are not wearing one.", "In Canada, if the passenger is 16 years or older, they're the one to get the fine instead of the driver. Which I think is reasonable.", "You\u2019re incorrect\u2014there are people who shouldn\u2019t wear seatbelts, and there are instances where seatbelts do more harm than good. It\u2019s just that these cases are _incredibly rare exceptions_ that people take and apply to themselves. \n\nMy uncle was advised not to wear a seatbelt for medical reasons. Two of his kids tried to use that as an excuse not to wear seatbelts. No, the exception to the rule is for this one specific person you know, not everyone they know, too.\n\nMaybe her uncle actually did die in a fiery car crash. Maybe his seatbelt played a factor! That doesn\u2019t change the fact that she\u2019s still more likely to receive a catastrophic injury from _not_ wearing a seatbelt than from wearing one.", "Read the post.", "I agree with everything except that last part. I assume everyone wears their seatbelt. If I\u2019m offering to drive someone I never ask \u201coh, by the way do you wear a seatbelt?\u201d Bit odd.", "Where I live it\u2019s a $300 fine to the driver. I wouldn\u2019t have moved, either. And how does she stand the incessant beeping of the reminder?\n\nEdit: NTA", "Thank you. It really is insane. Sometimes when I think about it it doesn't seem real.", "Yeah the dude not wearing a seatbelt was likely killed what her. When you're not secured into your seat in an accident you become a cannonball inside that vehicle. Probably headbutted her to death and can't deal with that fact so has to make it everyone else's problem.", "And she turns into an adult human sized projectile in the case of a serious accident. I\u2019d rather not risk it.", "Not sure I understand, u/fIumpf.  I don\u2019t think OP needed to ask ahead of time. The friend should have told OP, \u201cHey, I don\u2019t wear seatbelts. Is that an issue for you?\u201d", "Okay this is where \u201cmy trauma\u201d can go screw itself.\n\nWEAR SEATBELTS. you do not get a damn trauma pass from wearing a seatbelt. Her uncle died because of a seatbelt? Bullshit."]}
