There, I met this girl named Reese (23f). We share a lot of the same interests and we became pretty good friends. \n\nFor the past month or so, Reese has been on the hunt for a new job since her current one has abysmal pay. She finally got an interview, but about 4 days ago, her car broke down and she had to take it to the shop.

However, when I was pulling out of the parking lot, I noticed she wasn\u2019t wearing her seatbelt. Since I\u2019m uncomfortable driving people without seatbelts, I asked her to put it on, thinking she just forgot. But when I said that, she told me she doesn\u2019t wear seatbelts. I immediately stopped the car and told her she needed to put it on and the car would not be moving while she wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt. Reese got upset and said that her uncle died in a car accident because he got twisted up in his seatbelt and wasn\u2019t able to get out of the car before it exploded, so she doesn\u2019t wear a seatbelt for \u201csafety reasons.\u201d I felt terrible for her, but I stood firm and said I didn\u2019t want to get a fine for her not wearing her seatbelt. Furthermore, if we got in an accident and she got hurt because she wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt, I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself. \n\nReese only got more upset and said it was only a 15 minute drive and the chances of us getting into an accident are so low, so it doesn\u2019t matter. She also said she\u2019s a grown woman and I can\u2019t control what she does. I said that\u2019s true, but I\u2019m also a grown woman and I can choose whether or not I want to drive my car, and if she wasn\u2019t going to wear a seatbelt, I wasn\u2019t going to drive her. \n\nWe argued for a little bit more before I told her she can get an Uber if she feels so strongly about it. Reese called me an asshole and got out of my car and I just left. \n\nShe later texted me and said that she ended up being late for her interview, and now because of me, she wasn\u2019t going to get the job. I told her that all she had to do was put on a seatbelt and she made herself late. She responded that I wasn\u2019t being understanding of her trauma and I\u2019m a controlling bitch. So now I\u2019m having second thoughts.

You've clearly displayed respect for Reese's traumatic experience, yet safety in a vehicle isn't something to compromise. The rules around seatbelt use aren't meant to control us, but to protect us. It's unfortunate that Reese views your concern for safety as a controlling behavior. Maybe, if you feel up to it, a heart-to-heart conversation with Reese could help clear the air. Express why you stood your ground about the seatbelt and assure her that it was not about asserting control but ensuring safety. If she still can't grasp your viewpoint, it might be worth considering the future of this friendship.

They owned a very large house on the main street on a larger city in CT. The center of the street was divided, with trees and such. The house was on a corner.\n\nWe had just sat down for dinner, and we suddenly hear tires screaming and then a crash.\n\nThe dining room was on the second floor, in the middle of the house. I looked out the window, where I see debris sliding down the road in the narrow gap between their house and the next house.\n\nI ran to the front balcony and look down to see what remained of what looked like a brand new Corvette. It was wrapped around a tree, and there wasn't much left of it.\n\nFurther up the street I saw two bodies.\n\nI ran down stairs and out the door. The closer body was a middle aged man, probably the driver. He was about 30 feet from the crash. He was basically naked; he had been wearing khakis and a button down shirt over a tee shirt, but they had all been absolutely shredded, reduced to little more than rags, by his sliding down the road. I thought he was dead at first, because his eyes were dilated and his gaze was fixed, but as I reached him, he blinked and started to moan. He was pretty messed up, but all things considered, he didn't look like he had an immediately life threatening injury.\n\nI left my girlfriends brother and father with him, while I raced over to the other body.\n\nThis looked to be a ~17 year old guy. He was laying on the lawn of the house three houses down from where the accident happened. This house happened to be owned by a realtor company, and they had a large wooden sign in the front yard advertising it. There were two in ground lights that shined up at the sign, and at the base of the lights were square steel electrical boxes.\n\nI believe he was ejected from the car, and flew... Head first... Into one of those boxes.\n\nHe had an incredibly nasty cut on his scalp, several inches long, bleeding profusely, and I could see bone, and I suspect brain. He was seizing when I came up, but that stopped as I knelt down, and _he tried to get up_. Literally the only thing I could do was hold him down in case he had fucked his neck too. I only had to do it for a moment or two, because there was a fire station just up the street, so some EMTs got there just after.\n\nI don't know if he survived. I could never bring myself to look too deeply into it. But the sound of that crash, the initial sight of the two bodies, and view of his head spraying blood as he had a seizure, has stayed with me. \n\nIf the had been wearing seatbelts, they both would probably have been shook up, but mostly ok.\n\nAnd the worst thing about that day was when we went back in side, I discovered that my girlfriends mother had made the homemade ravioli with Pecorino Romano, which she knew I fucking hated, instead of parmesan.", "That bus looked like a coach-style bus.

Since I'm 170cm tall, means my head travelled roughly 2.67m in 1s, which is roughly equal to 9km/h.\n\nSo if you travel above 9km/hr, or 5.5mph, then you are at risk of brain injury if you don't wear your seatbelt.", "Great info!!

I just remember walking up with two friends  to say goodbye and recoiling. I felt sick. My friends steadied me, we locked arms, and made our way to the casket.  You could tell it was him, but it wasn't right. Things were...off. And the makeup was so thick, and even thicker in some areas, trying to cover the damage. He did not look real.
