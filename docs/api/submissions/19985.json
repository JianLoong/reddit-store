There, I met this girl named Reese (23f). We share a lot of the same interests and we became pretty good friends. \n\nFor the past month or so, Reese has been on the hunt for a new job since her current one has abysmal pay. She finally got an interview, but about 4 days ago, her car broke down and she had to take it to the shop.

However, when I was pulling out of the parking lot, I noticed she wasn\u2019t wearing her seatbelt. Since I\u2019m uncomfortable driving people without seatbelts, I asked her to put it on, thinking she just forgot. But when I said that, she told me she doesn\u2019t wear seatbelts. I immediately stopped the car and told her she needed to put it on and the car would not be moving while she wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt. Reese got upset and said that her uncle died in a car accident because he got twisted up in his seatbelt and wasn\u2019t able to get out of the car before it exploded, so she doesn\u2019t wear a seatbelt for \u201csafety reasons.\u201d I felt terrible for her, but I stood firm and said I didn\u2019t want to get a fine for her not wearing her seatbelt. Furthermore, if we got in an accident and she got hurt because she wasn\u2019t wearing a seatbelt, I wouldn\u2019t be able to live with myself. \n\nReese only got more upset and said it was only a 15 minute drive and the chances of us getting into an accident are so low, so it doesn\u2019t matter. She also said she\u2019s a grown woman and I can\u2019t control what she does. I said that\u2019s true, but I\u2019m also a grown woman and I can choose whether or not I want to drive my car, and if she wasn\u2019t going to wear a seatbelt, I wasn\u2019t going to drive her. \n\nWe argued for a little bit more before I told her she can get an Uber if she feels so strongly about it. Reese called me an asshole and got out of my car and I just left. \n\nShe later texted me and said that she ended up being late for her interview, and now because of me, she wasn\u2019t going to get the job. I told her that all she had to do was put on a seatbelt and she made herself late. She responded that I wasn\u2019t being understanding of her trauma and I\u2019m a controlling bitch. So now I\u2019m having second thoughts.

You've clearly displayed respect for Reese's traumatic experience, yet safety in a vehicle isn't something to compromise. The rules around seatbelt use aren't meant to control us, but to protect us. It's unfortunate that Reese views your concern for safety as a controlling behavior. Maybe, if you feel up to it, a heart-to-heart conversation with Reese could help clear the air. Express why you stood your ground about the seatbelt and assure her that it was not about asserting control but ensuring safety. If she still can't grasp your viewpoint, it might be worth considering the future of this friendship.
