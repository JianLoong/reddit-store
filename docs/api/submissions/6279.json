She just doesn't know that. \n\nSide note: Both of you can use the name, who really cares. I have multiple cousins with the same name.", "No you're NTA. SIL needs to get over herself, she doesn't own the name. Besides, you got there first. Simple as that.", "Nta and if it was in a movie, ten other girls in her class will have the same.", "NTA you\u2019ve had that name picked out all your life she didn\u2019t know that so she\u2019s just making assumptions that you just doing it out of spite and if your brother really does choose to try to force you to change it that\u2019s not OK", "Literally damned if you do, damned if you don't.

Set your spine and go forward with what you want, no reason to deal with all that Bs if it's not worth something in the end. NTA", "Info: what's the name", "NTA. No one owns a baby name and she really jumped the gun if she actually did get things monogrammed ahead of time.", "NTA. Good luck", "NTA. No one owns a name. If it bothers SIL so much, she can find a new name to match the already-monogrammed items. She sounds very \u201cextra\u201d.", "NTA. People really need to stop thinking they own names.", "NTA \n\nShe can name her kid the same thing!\n\nI mean they probably have different last names and go tk different schools and see each other 3 times a year!", "NTA. Nobody owns baby names. if she wants to name a future daughter the same name, she should use it too.", "NTA. I also had a girl's name from a movie I saved for when I finally had my baby girl. Your SIL does know that you don't have a monopoly on the name, right?", "NTA no one, nobody, no no no owns a name, just no!", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t own the name. Many people in this world have the same name as someone else and it\u2019s not a big deal.", "NTA!  If her baby had been a girl, you'd better believe she would have used it, where or not she knew you liked it!  I have cousins who share the same name.....so what?!  It's not like anyone can call dibs on a name or copyright it!  You've loved the name all of your life, and have every right to name your daughter what you wish.\n\nRemind your brother of the roots when you first fell in love with the name, and that you've never stopped loving it!  And for her to have monograms put on her own baby items before the child was even born is plain old dumb to do!'", "ESH.\n\nYou loved this name so much you didn't find a time in 20+ years to bring it up to your family... not even when you actually knew that your BIL + his partner were very likely going to use that name if they had a girl?\n\nThere was a clear opportunity to have this conversation BEFORE babies were on the way. You should have taken it. It would have been unpleasant, but you could have at least ironed it out -- potentially come up with a compromise, or a different series of spellings, or someone using it as a middle name. Or been at this impasse you have now, but at least your intentions and longstanding love of this name would be known.\n\nObviously SIL jumped the gun by getting baby monograms over everything (maybe it's me, but I don't think you should really truly name a baby until you see him/her for the first time?), and your brother is nuts to think you're going to change your child's LEGAL NAME.", "ESH\n\nSuggesting your brother try to convince you to change a baby\u2019s name that\u2019s already been born is ridiculous, but I definitely feel you should have said something during that initial baby name conversation as well.", "ESH. They clearly make your life hell with their drama, so they are definitely AH. But you had a chance to speak up and didn't take it, so you're not free from blame. I'm curious what you thought would happen?", "I totally missed this on first read, SIL was pregnant with a girl that she had named that name, you had your daughter a few months before her and used that name without giving anyone a heads up! \n\nKnowing it was their top girls name and not telling them before your daughter is named does make YTA. Not for using the name, but for not saying anything. Wether you loved it first or not, you were sneaky and weird about it. You knew and didn\u2019t have a conversation about it. She was over 4 mo pregnant with a girl that she was calling that name and you named your daughter the name everyone knew she was naming her daughter without saying anything!\n\nThat\u2019s confrontational!! Especially for someone who claims to hate confrontation! \n\nPersonally I tell people my names and say, if you use it that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019m still going to use it.", "NTA, as no one owns a name, but I do see where your SIL is coming from. You easily could've just mentioned \"oh, I've liked that name as well since I was a kid,\" and if that sparked a disagreement, well, at least they would've *known.*  Like, \"hey I know you like that name, but I've been planning on using it for my daughter, and I will be naming her that.\"\n\nInstead, it's as if you heard SIL mention a name, then completely out of nowhere, give your child the name she's been thinking of. \n\nAs I said, no one owns a name, and it's very possible to have two children in the family with the same name (I have two cousins named Isabelle that were born two months apart). But when pregnancy hormones are involved, an anthill looks like a mountain and nothing is okay.   \nI really recommend sitting down and trying to clear the air, if possible. The hurt feeling will possibly remain for a long time, but it's worth a shot to try.", "ESH. \n\nSIL is not entitled to the name. \n\nYou had literal years to mention that you also considered that name, and then 9 months of pregnancy (some of which time you specifically knew your SIL was also pregnant with a girl) to let them know you planned to use it. Of course she\u2019s hurt and frustrated.", "ESH. Doesn't matter if you were technically right. They talked about it in front of family and you said nothing. The optics are too bad for you to win here without causing some sizeable family fractures. If they were monogramming stuff odds are other family members knew as well so you may catch flack that way too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Then this 'stealing' idea would have been avoided. However, I understand SIL - I always wanted to call a daughter by a particular family name, which my sister used first. Even though I knew it was irrational, I was still very sad about 'losing' that name, although I didn't say so. (I only had a son, though, so just as well she picked it!)", "I think you stole the name. It makes no sense that you wouldn\u2019t have said anything about a name you wanted since you were a child. And then you claim that the reason you don\u2019t want her taking the name is because of how she acts and not because you always wanted this name for your own child. That doesn\u2019t make any sense. So I\u2019m going with YTA.", "ESH. \nYes your brother and SIL are way over the top on asking you to change your daughter's name, however they mentioned the name they wanted before and as long as no one owns a name it feels like a betrayal that you use that name cause you were not honest with them and you had your chance. I mean you didn't had to mention it when you first talk about it but had your whole 9 months pregnancy to -not to ask- but let them know that you always loved the name and chose it long time ago. You could even get to an agreement idk like change a letter or something like that.", "Nta, why can\u2019t she also use it? So what if cousins share a first name. Sounds like a great way for them to cause trouble together later on \ud83d\ude02", "Funny you say that because I did mention this in our last conversation and he said \"I never heard you say you liked that name\"\n\nYeah because you would have definitely listened to me ramble about my baby name choices when we were 8 and 10 lol", "I wish people would just STFU about baby names and just name their babies.

At least have a heads up conversation as a common courtesy.\n\nYou had many opportunities to say something, for years knowing they liked the name. And again when you got pregnant with a girl, and when you found out SIL was pregnant, when you found out SIL was pregnant with a girl, anytime before your daughter was born\u2026 but waiting till your daughter is born to announce the name knowing pregnant SIL had already named her baby that is an AH move. Not saying anything makes YTA because you knew and left them in the dark.", "This! No name is safe, no matter how unique you think it is.

You didn\u2019t kick the can down the road, you tossed the snowball down the hill and between then and now allowed the issue to become a much bigger one.\n\nYour SIL doesn\u2019t own the name, but she is also entitled to a *reasonable* amount of frustration given how outspoken she has been about loving that name while you just let her continue thinking she\u2019d be able to use it without any complication.\n\nYou owe them an apology for that. She owes you one for going completely mental.", "That doesn\u2019t make any sense.

One of them came with the same name as one of my niblings. Of course all hell broke loose, you can't have a cat named after one nibling and the other cat not named after the other nibling.

It causes a world of confusion when we're all under the same roof but it's hilarious.", "My sister found out her baby was a boy at 8 weeks. \nI also have no problem with my kids having the same name as cousins or friends. But I\u2019d still give them a heads up. Not because I\u2019d change the name but because they might want to before getting attached to it.
