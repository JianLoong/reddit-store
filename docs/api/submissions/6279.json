You should have taken it. It would have been unpleasant, but you could have at least ironed it out -- potentially come up with a compromise, or a different series of spellings, or someone using it as a middle name. Or been at this impasse you have now, but at least your intentions and longstanding love of this name would be known.\n\nObviously SIL jumped the gun by getting baby monograms over everything (maybe it's me, but I don't think you should really truly name a baby until you see him/her for the first time?), and your brother is nuts to think you're going to change your child's LEGAL NAME.", "ESH\n\nSuggesting your brother try to convince you to change a baby\u2019s name that\u2019s already been born is ridiculous, but I definitely feel you should have said something during that initial baby name conversation as well.", "ESH. They clearly make your life hell with their drama, so they are definitely AH. But you had a chance to speak up and didn't take it, so you're not free from blame. I'm curious what you thought would happen?", "I totally missed this on first read, SIL was pregnant with a girl that she had named that name, you had your daughter a few months before her and used that name without giving anyone a heads up! \n\nKnowing it was their top girls name and not telling them before your daughter is named does make YTA. Not for using the name, but for not saying anything. Wether you loved it first or not, you were sneaky and weird about it. You knew and didn\u2019t have a conversation about it. She was over 4 mo pregnant with a girl that she was calling that name and you named your daughter the name everyone knew she was naming her daughter without saying anything!\n\nThat\u2019s confrontational!! Especially for someone who claims to hate confrontation! \n\nPersonally I tell people my names and say, if you use it that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019m still going to use it.", "NTA, as no one owns a name, but I do see where your SIL is coming from. You easily could've just mentioned \"oh, I've liked that name as well since I was a kid,\" and if that sparked a disagreement, well, at least they would've *known.*  Like, \"hey I know you like that name, but I've been planning on using it for my daughter, and I will be naming her that.\"\n\nInstead, it's as if you heard SIL mention a name, then completely out of nowhere, give your child the name she's been thinking of. \n\nAs I said, no one owns a name, and it's very possible to have two children in the family with the same name (I have two cousins named Isabelle that were born two months apart). But when pregnancy hormones are involved, an anthill looks like a mountain and nothing is okay.   \nI really recommend sitting down and trying to clear the air, if possible. The hurt feeling will possibly remain for a long time, but it's worth a shot to try.", "ESH. \n\nSIL is not entitled to the name. \n\nYou had literal years to mention that you also considered that name, and then 9 months of pregnancy (some of which time you specifically knew your SIL was also pregnant with a girl) to let them know you planned to use it. Of course she\u2019s hurt and frustrated.", "ESH. Doesn't matter if you were technically right. They talked about it in front of family and you said nothing. The optics are too bad for you to win here without causing some sizeable family fractures. If they were monogramming stuff odds are other family members knew as well so you may catch flack that way too.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I mean you didn't had to mention it when you first talk about it but had your whole 9 months pregnancy to -not to ask- but let them know that you always loved the name and chose it long time ago. You could even get to an agreement idk like change a letter or something like that.", "Nta, why can\u2019t she also use it? So what if cousins share a first name.

Just sayin, if a random internet stranger can pick up on that there\u2019s probably a reason she feels that way.\n\n(And for everyone else, no no one has the right to hold a name BUT it\u2019s common decency to at least have a CONVERSATION with a family member about using a name they love WHEN THEY ARE PREGNANT AND YOU KNEW THEY PLANNED TO USE IT).", "YTA.
