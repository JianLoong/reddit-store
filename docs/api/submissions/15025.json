There were a lot of repeat questions since some things I couldn\u2019t explain fully due to the character limit, so hopefully I can provide some clarification.\n\nI was concerned and initially made the decision to uninvite her because she was insistent on living life just as she did before her stroke, and didn't even want a part-time caregiver until an incident at the grocery store that ended with her hospitalized. I didn't want her to be in a similar situation just for me. If she got hurt or worse as a result of her overexerting herself at my wedding I would never forgive myself. I thought I was doing the right thing for her sake, but a lot of the comments gave me some much-needed perspective. A handful of people were convinced I was embarrassed by my grandmother\u2019s health issues, worried she would \"ruin\" the wedding, or hoped my grandmother would pass away\u2026 As my grandmother is fond of saying, \u201ceven Evel Knievel couldn\u2019t make that leap\u201d.\n\nI will admit part of why I came to the decision was the result of frustration and lack of any sort of help from family, not just for the wedding but it feels like they've given up on her altogether. I was at my wit\u2019s end with them, didn\u2019t know what else to do, got massively stressed and overwhelmed. It was taking more of a toll than I realized. I\u2019ll likely have a serious talk with certain family members later on.\n\nWe did look into hiring/renting assistance of any kind but we've put almost all our money towards the venue, which was chosen by my dad and step-mom. They paid the down payment on our home and used that to steer the wedding in a direction they want, so they heavily influenced a lot of decisions. At the time it would've worked fine since everything was booked and paid before my grandmother had the stroke. She's my mom's (who isn't in the picture) mother and was never close with my dad, so my parents aren't willing to provide financial help to get her some assistance. No one from her side wants to help either so we're on our own.\n\nAs for the main update, we\u2019ve found a way for my grandmother to safely attend the wedding! I stated in some comments my grandmother was very active in her community, even leading right up to the stroke. One of her favorite things was reading to kids at a nearby elementary school, and I learned she\u2019d become good friends with one of the custodians who would help her navigate the building and escort her around, a really nice guy in his 40\u2019s. I contacted him and explained the situation, and he said he would love to be her dedicated help for the day of the wedding.\n\nWhen he said that the relief and excitement I felt was indescribable. Of course I went to my grandmother and begged forgiveness, and explained the plan for the day. She was happy with the arrangement, and said while she understood I had good intentions, if I \u201ctry any nonsense like that again, she\u2019d drop dead out of spite\u201d.

Although I hope you and hubby shine up your spines toward your parents.  A gift of a down payment does not mean they get to dictate your choices.", "YAAAY good update", "What a great update!

Unfortunately she wasn't available the day of the wedding.", "Yeah, we initially went along with it because we weren't too concerned with the details of the wedding since it didn't really matter at the time, we just wanted to get married and have our families together. But I think allowing them to dictate aspects of the wedding like that gave them some sense of entitlement to decide more than we feel comfortable with, so sometime in the near future we will for sure be having a discussion and setting some boundaries.", "Im so glad you managed to come to a great resolution\n\nI deffo understand stubborn grandparents. My granddad is the same and even after being run over, fallen off a roof AND fallen out a boat STILL refuses any help of any kind. I love him but my god it's a nightmare lol", "No, you are not.", "oh good, just hoping medicaid is paying for it and not private pay. nobody should private pay for care", "Deeeeeeef  sets a bad precedence.  Good luck!"]}
