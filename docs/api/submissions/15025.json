There were a lot of repeat questions since some things I couldn\u2019t explain fully due to the character limit, so hopefully I can provide some clarification.\n\nI was concerned and initially made the decision to uninvite her because she was insistent on living life just as she did before her stroke, and didn't even want a part-time caregiver until an incident at the grocery store that ended with her hospitalized. I didn't want her to be in a similar situation just for me. If she got hurt or worse as a result of her overexerting herself at my wedding I would never forgive myself. I thought I was doing the right thing for her sake, but a lot of the comments gave me some much-needed perspective. A handful of people were convinced I was embarrassed by my grandmother\u2019s health issues, worried she would \"ruin\" the wedding, or hoped my grandmother would pass away\u2026 As my grandmother is fond of saying, \u201ceven Evel Knievel couldn\u2019t make that leap\u201d.\n\nI will admit part of why I came to the decision was the result of frustration and lack of any sort of help from family, not just for the wedding but it feels like they've given up on her altogether. I was at my wit\u2019s end with them, didn\u2019t know what else to do, got massively stressed and overwhelmed. It was taking more of a toll than I realized. I\u2019ll likely have a serious talk with certain family members later on.\n\nWe did look into hiring/renting assistance of any kind but we've put almost all our money towards the venue, which was chosen by my dad and step-mom. They paid the down payment on our home and used that to steer the wedding in a direction they want, so they heavily influenced a lot of decisions. At the time it would've worked fine since everything was booked and paid before my grandmother had the stroke. She's my mom's (who isn't in the picture) mother and was never close with my dad, so my parents aren't willing to provide financial help to get her some assistance. No one from her side wants to help either so we're on our own.\n\nAs for the main update, we\u2019ve found a way for my grandmother to safely attend the wedding! I stated in some comments my grandmother was very active in her community, even leading right up to the stroke. One of her favorite things was reading to kids at a nearby elementary school, and I learned she\u2019d become good friends with one of the custodians who would help her navigate the building and escort her around, a really nice guy in his 40\u2019s. I contacted him and explained the situation, and he said he would love to be her dedicated help for the day of the wedding.\n\nWhen he said that the relief and excitement I felt was indescribable. Of course I went to my grandmother and begged forgiveness, and explained the plan for the day. She was happy with the arrangement, and said while she understood I had good intentions, if I \u201ctry any nonsense like that again, she\u2019d drop dead out of spite\u201d.

Although I hope you and hubby shine up your spines toward your parents.  A gift of a down payment does not mean they get to dictate your choices.", "YAAAY good update", "What a great update! Congrats OP.

Unfortunately she wasn't available the day of the wedding.", "Yeah, we initially went along with it because we weren't too concerned with the details of the wedding since it didn't really matter at the time, we just wanted to get married and have our families together. But I think allowing them to dictate aspects of the wedding like that gave them some sense of entitlement to decide more than we feel comfortable with, so sometime in the near future we will for sure be having a discussion and setting some boundaries.", "Im so glad you managed to come to a great resolution\n\nI deffo understand stubborn grandparents. My granddad is the same and even after being run over, fallen off a roof AND fallen out a boat STILL refuses any help of any kind. I love him but my god it's a nightmare lol", "No, you are not.", "oh good, just hoping medicaid is paying for it and not private pay. nobody should private pay for care", "Deeeeeeef  sets a bad precedence.

I get where you were coming from, and yeah, Reddit can be pretty brutal in its opinions. \n\nI am glad that a gentle and positive solution came out of this. Congratulations on the wedding. \n\nAlso, \"drop dead out of spite\" made me laugh out loud. Your grandma is a hoot.", "Oh gosh, I\u2019m crying. I too loved my grandma to the moon and back. She was also as stubborn as yours \ud83d\ude00.

Tell her an internet stranger reckons she's a tough auld bird (it's a compliment).", "And not to mention, some were acting like OP did it because they were worried about the wedding being ruined. Like... No, imagine the guilt if your grandmother dropped dead at your wedding. Some were quite heartless in their judgement", "Make sure the groom dances with grandma. He can find her wherever she's sitting and just dance for one minute if that's all she's up to. Take pictures. The bride could dance with grandma, too. Those photos will be priceless.", "Grandma sent me with that last line! I'm so happy to hear she can be there for that special day \ud83d\udc97", "I\u2019m so pleased to hear that you have been able to sort this out.  The custodian is happy to help her attend the wedding because he knows that she\u2019s a good person, who donated her time for the children.  The moral of the story is that sometimes acquaintances are more willing to help than family.", "Good on you.", "*Applause*. Great update!  Best wishes, OP.", "This  probably isn't necessary to point out- but just in case- please make sure you have a place set/meal planned out for the custodian too. \n\nI've just witnessed situations in the past where the helpers were forgotten and would hate for this to be an oversight.\n\nWish you all the best for your wedding day and all the happiness for the future OP!!", "You\u2019ve learned an important lesson about your father and stepmother here.  Just remember:  free money isn\u2019t free.", "I didn't see your original post, but I'm so glad that you've put things right.   \n\n\nMy late husband had a stroke. I was his carer. He was completely compos mentis, but he was left with hemiparesis, meaning that he had to learn to walk again (with a stick) and couldn't use his left hand. I had to help him wash and dress.  \n\n\nWhen his granddaughter turned 18, his daughter organised a birthday weekend away for her. The only immediate family member not to be invited was my husband. We'd been getting on relatively well with his ex, to the extent that I'd taken her to a hospital appointment after her partner died. The daughter and her sibling had thanked me for doing it. The ex was invited. (It was her affair that had broken up the marriage.) We knew about the birthday weekend only because - on the trip back from the holiday - the ex told me that she was going away for the weekend with the daughter and granddaughter. We had thought that it was a girls' away weekend, hence the lack of an invitation for my husband.  \n\n\nWe didn't know until we saw the photos on FB that it was \\*not\\* a girls' only trip. That was when the realisation hit us that only my husband had been missed out.   \n\n\nThe next time he saw his daughter, he asked why he'd not been invited. There was a pause and then 'Oh...I didn't think you'd want to come.'\n\nBy contrast, when his nephew got married, our wedding invitation came with a note listing accessible accommodation near the wedding venue.  When the photographs were taken, an armchair was organised for my husband (who couldn't stand still for long) and a photo was taken of my darling surrounded by the wedding party.   \n\n\nI'll never forget my nephew's kindness. And I can never forgive my stepdaughter's thoughtlessness.", "Yes absolutely, we've already got his meal and seat sorted.", "If you're not having a childfree wedding and you have the space maybe set up a time area for her to read to the kiddos! \nI'm really happy you found a solution and congratulations \ud83c\udf8a", "Try any nonsense like that again and I\u2019ll drop dead out of spite\u201d - she sounds like my Granny.", "I\u2019m so glad you posted that and listened. You would\u2019ve regretted that decision later in life. My grandma died a week ago and I\u2019ve been thinking of my missed opportunities.", "Can I just say that just because they pay for things, you are no obligated to do what they say. That was their choice. So stop letting them push you around. And you're a good granddaughter and your grandmother sounds fabulous. But make some boundaries with your family. You need them. Have a great wedding!", "I\u2019m so glad you found help. I did think reading your last post, where are the groomsmen at?  If the bride\u2019s elderly grandma needs a ride back and forth between the ceremony and reception, every groom I\u2019ve known would\u2019ve had his boys out there with a litter to carry the girl or set up like sled dogs.", "There's only two groomsmen and neither of them felt comfortable carrying her around and were worried they might drop her or accidentally injure her or something. We debated putting together some sort of contraption to transport her around but it didn't feel safe enough. Fortunately the custodian guy is rather fit so he has no problem if/when he needs to provide physical assistance.", "Good luck. Hope the day goes off without a hitch.", "This is a great update, I'm so happy for you and your grandmother. She sounds like someone who doesn't like to miss a special occasion! \ud83d\ude0a \n\nMaybe give her and her escort a matching corsage / bouttoniere? He sounds like a wonderful guy."]}
