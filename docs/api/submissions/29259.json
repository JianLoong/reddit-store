We had been dating for 10 years and most of his family knew about us. I went to his sisters wedding because I was invited and it was a nice experience.\n\nI have grown up to be very social and career oriented and really value education. My husband is the same and that\u2019s how we really connected with each other. My SIL however has a different mindset. She got married at a very young age and chose to have a family (she has one daughter) and chose to not pursue a college degree, however is a total brat and has always been said yes for everything (for context, she had a 3 day wedding in Italy with 120 guests). She doesn\u2019t hate me but doesn\u2019t love me either and the feelings are mutual. We just don\u2019t connect. \n\nWe recently took a new house and threw a housewarming for all his family and everyone loved the house. We have an extra guest bedroom, just incase. His sister absolutely loved the house (which she said like 50 times) and said she would move some of her daughter\u2019s stuff here (in the extra room) because we have too much space and she doesn\u2019t want to carry it whenever she comes. We live in New York and she comes from New Mexico. I really didn\u2019t get the logic and politely declined and said we have a lot of guests coming every now and then and do not have spare space for your daughter\u2019s clothes or toys. She wasn\u2019t happy but I didn\u2019t care. \n\nIt\u2019s been 4 months since we bought the house and she\u2019s come a total of 53 days (yes I counted!) Most of the time she comes unannounced and says \u201cI was visiting someone or I was in the neighbourhood\u201d. What kind of person would fly from New Mexico to New York to be in the neighbourhood? Anyway, slowly I realised she had started putting up her pictures and redecorating our guest bedroom and lost my sh*t. I told my husband and he said I\u2019m overthinking and she\u2019s just trying to be friends with me. \n\nWhen she left last week, I packed a box of all her things which she very conveniently \u201cforgets\u201d in our guest bedroom and shipped it to her place. She got very very angry and called me and started screaming at me. I told her to stop over reacting and stop considering our house as hers and that she\u2019s no longer welcome. \n\nI told my husband everything and that I would not entertain her anymore. He agreed to what I said and told his sister that she needs to stop doing this or she\u2019s no longer welcome. \n\nShe called my in-laws and literally every person we know and told them we were being like a*holes. Our phones have been buzzing with texts and calls saying how inconsiderate we are and that what we did was wrong. I told everyone if you\u2019re so interested, keep her in your house and stop bothering me.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people writing that she\u2019s running from an abusive husband. She\u2019s not. She got married at 17 because she was pregnant with her daughter and got divorced 3 years later. She lives with her parents in a 5 bedroom townhouse with no job.

My best guess is that she's low key trying to set the room up for your niece. Then she'll surprise dump the poor girl on you and your SIL will go live her best child free party lifestyle.", "Nta - shipping her crap back to her, genius!", "NTA.  This is your house and she has no right to assume that she can use it in any capacity.  For the people who think you are inconsiderate - she can take her stuff to their houses.", "NTA shipping the stuff back and telling the other relatives to entertain her was beautiful. So glad your husband is supportive. 53 days! What a loon. Her husband is probably crying now that she\u2019s back.", "NTA sounds like she is trying to take over and turn yall into eventual babysitters.", "NTA\n\nThat is very bizarre behaviour.

Like you said in your edit. She loves the idea of NYC and is carving out your spare room as her own. I have a spare room. TONS of my family use it (ironically my parents are living in New Mexico) but not my in laws, my brother, my parents - not one has left anything or changed anything in that room without us telling them to leave it! IE I told my brother to leave a pair of swimming trunks in one of the drawers and dedicated it to him (who knows if we wanna hit the hot tub in December with a few beers on a saturday night ?) I can tell you my wife would lose her mind and so would I if anyone just decided to leave things there or change decor. If they offered and we liked it, fine, but to just do it on your own ? Crazy behavior.", "NTA, her behavior is unhinged. I think it might be worth talking to your husband about if everything is going ok for her in New Mexico as it sounds like she might be plotting to escape to your guest room.", "NTA - your SIL started off being very strange, and is now being very petty", "NTA. \n\nShe left behind alot of things including pictures and thought that was fine.

This is a hill to die on.", "NTA - This is your house and your boundary is that guests are welcome as long as they behave as guests.  This is NOT her house.  I would set the additional boundary that only guests who provide notice of their visit are welcome.

Dropping the hint about her daughters stuff, the fact she's been in your house nearly two out of the four months you've been there, flying across the country for a visit, that's not normal. She's very clearly trying to insert herself so that eventually she can say \"well I have all my stuff here anyway and I'm always here so I might as well just move in!\".

I doubt she's been told no very much.

I like that you told the others to host her. \nI think I might tell them that they have no idea how she is and they should be happy that they don\u2019t. Leave it at that.

You can also have the lock tell you when different codes are used via text message.", "NTA\n\nIt is YOUR home.  Random people, yes family included, do not get to arbitrarily decide they are moving in without your permission.  This goes for visiting also.\n\nGlad your husband has your back.

Once the airlines started charging for bags, I had a room at my brother\u2019s house and he had a room at mine to keep stuff that would allow us to travel with carry on bags.

It\u2019s a fantastic way to drive the point home that she is a guest and that you won\u2019t put up with her crap.

SIL is planning a \u201csoft move\u201d into your house in NY, and of course her parents are all for it.  You\u2019ll support her and her daughter until she finds a man to support her, and the in laws will finally be off the hook!  Stand your ground on this one, no moving in her stuff, no more impromptu visits, and if she asks for temp housing until she gets on her feet, say \u201cNo\u201d.

She eventually just moves in and takes over your house?  She counts on your husband backing her up so she can do a \"f-u\" to you in some sort of weird power play?  It's more than a bit bizarre, given the actual distance between where you live and she does.\n\nAs for the family flying monkeys she has summoned, I suggest sending out a message to all that you welcome short-term GUESTS who have coordinated with you AND BEEN INVITED for short-term visits, but that this is your home, and you expect that guests will follow generally-accepted etiquette rules for such short-term visits....which include not redecorating your guestroom.\n\nAnd then block whoever can't see reason.", "NTA.
