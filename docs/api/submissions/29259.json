We had been dating for 10 years and most of his family knew about us. I went to his sisters wedding because I was invited and it was a nice experience.\n\nI have grown up to be very social and career oriented and really value education. My husband is the same and that\u2019s how we really connected with each other. My SIL however has a different mindset. She got married at a very young age and chose to have a family (she has one daughter) and chose to not pursue a college degree, however is a total brat and has always been said yes for everything (for context, she had a 3 day wedding in Italy with 120 guests). She doesn\u2019t hate me but doesn\u2019t love me either and the feelings are mutual. We just don\u2019t connect. \n\nWe recently took a new house and threw a housewarming for all his family and everyone loved the house. We have an extra guest bedroom, just incase. His sister absolutely loved the house (which she said like 50 times) and said she would move some of her daughter\u2019s stuff here (in the extra room) because we have too much space and she doesn\u2019t want to carry it whenever she comes. We live in New York and she comes from New Mexico. I really didn\u2019t get the logic and politely declined and said we have a lot of guests coming every now and then and do not have spare space for your daughter\u2019s clothes or toys. She wasn\u2019t happy but I didn\u2019t care. \n\nIt\u2019s been 4 months since we bought the house and she\u2019s come a total of 53 days (yes I counted!) Most of the time she comes unannounced and says \u201cI was visiting someone or I was in the neighbourhood\u201d. What kind of person would fly from New Mexico to New York to be in the neighbourhood? Anyway, slowly I realised she had started putting up her pictures and redecorating our guest bedroom and lost my sh*t. I told my husband and he said I\u2019m overthinking and she\u2019s just trying to be friends with me. \n\nWhen she left last week, I packed a box of all her things which she very conveniently \u201cforgets\u201d in our guest bedroom and shipped it to her place. She got very very angry and called me and started screaming at me. I told her to stop over reacting and stop considering our house as hers and that she\u2019s no longer welcome. \n\nI told my husband everything and that I would not entertain her anymore. He agreed to what I said and told his sister that she needs to stop doing this or she\u2019s no longer welcome. \n\nShe called my in-laws and literally every person we know and told them we were being like a*holes. Our phones have been buzzing with texts and calls saying how inconsiderate we are and that what we did was wrong. I told everyone if you\u2019re so interested, keep her in your house and stop bothering me.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I see a lot of people writing that she\u2019s running from an abusive husband. She\u2019s not. She got married at 17 because she was pregnant with her daughter and got divorced 3 years later. She lives with her parents in a 5 bedroom townhouse with no job.

Then she'll surprise dump the poor girl on you and your SIL will go live her best child free party lifestyle.", "Nta - shipping her crap back to her, genius!", "NTA.  This is your house and she has no right to assume that she can use it in any capacity.  For the people who think you are inconsiderate - she can take her stuff to their houses.", "NTA shipping the stuff back and telling the other relatives to entertain her was beautiful. So glad your husband is supportive. 53 days! What a loon. Her husband is probably crying now that she\u2019s back.", "NTA sounds like she is trying to take over and turn yall into eventual babysitters.", "NTA\n\nThat is very bizarre behaviour.

Like you said in your edit. She loves the idea of NYC and is carving out your spare room as her own. I have a spare room. TONS of my family use it (ironically my parents are living in New Mexico) but not my in laws, my brother, my parents - not one has left anything or changed anything in that room without us telling them to leave it! IE I told my brother to leave a pair of swimming trunks in one of the drawers and dedicated it to him (who knows if we wanna hit the hot tub in December with a few beers on a saturday night ?) I can tell you my wife would lose her mind and so would I if anyone just decided to leave things there or change decor. If they offered and we liked it, fine, but to just do it on your own ? Crazy behavior.", "NTA, her behavior is unhinged. I think it might be worth talking to your husband about if everything is going ok for her in New Mexico as it sounds like she might be plotting to escape to your guest room.", "NTA - your SIL started off being very strange, and is now being very petty", "NTA. \n\nShe left behind alot of things including pictures and thought that was fine.

Dropping the hint about her daughters stuff, the fact she's been in your house nearly two out of the four months you've been there, flying across the country for a visit, that's not normal.

You can also have the lock tell you when different codes are used via text message.", "NTA\n\nIt is YOUR home.

Once the airlines started charging for bags, I had a room at my brother\u2019s house and he had a room at mine to keep stuff that would allow us to travel with carry on bags.

What's her plan after all? Move in her stuff little by little until \"oops, I guess I live here too!\"? That would require OP to be the perfect doormat to work. It's amazing that anyone could come up with such a dumb plan!\n\nNTA.", "I'd be interested to know how often she brought her kid with her for these impromptu visits. I may be wrong, but I'd bet money the dynamic is that she leaves kid behind. MIL and FIL are happy because they get to play primary caregiver to granddaughter, while mom fucks off to New York solo for shopping and fun on their (and OP's) dime. \n\nThey're probably angry bc, though expensive, it was worth it to them for her to be happy and gone, so that they could spend time spoiling granddaughter to turn out just as fucked up.", "Yep. Respond to all those people and tell them thanks for letting SIL set up a room in each of their houses. \n\nJust the fact SIL thinks she can take over ANYTHING in brother's house tells me she's either the golden child or has never been told No so has no boundaries.", "Maybe she plans to dump the kid. But I'd just say it's just as likely that she wants to move in, along with the kid as well! She's been there 57 days out of the last 120. That's absolutely INSANE.", "she's trying to set it up for herself AND her daughter lol", "Detective monk ?", "How much do you want to bet she\u2019s told her entire circle in NM that she\u2019s moving to NYC?", "And get a Ring doorbell. If she turns up ignore her and let her sit outside until she goes away. Ignore phone calls. Call back hours later and say you are away.", "TIL that I should not move to NM.", "I may be wrong, but I think the intent is to highlight SIL\u2019s priorities. Her family could certainly afford higher education but she declined the opportunity. She was, however, keen on a three-day wedding in Italy at 17.", "This really needs to be seen!", "The parents, to get some time with her and daughter out of their house.", "\"Oopsie, I forgot a few things.\"\n\n\"That's cool. I shipped them to your home.\"\n\n\"WHAT THE FUCK?!!!?!!!!\"\n\nYup. Pretty transparent. Lol", "Actually, it's perfect way to move in, legally, and OP not be able to stop them.  If they slowly bring in enough of their belongings, then start staying there enough, all it would take is to mail themselves something and bam, they are a legal tenant that now requires a legal eviction and up to a year to get rid of.  No lease or agreement required.", "More likely to leave the kid with her parents and try to move in to party it up in NYC. Then when she gets knocked upa gain, a failed attempt at marriage later she'll decide OP is responsible for raising and paying for that one.", ">At least where I live, after 30 days it\u2019s abandoned property\n\nThe sister probably is never gone that long. She's there almost 50% of the time.", "There have been people who have changed family photos all over the house with photos of Matt Damon and has been months before anyone noticed.", "Agree it\u2019s relevant. It sheds light on SIL\u2019s outlook and character. Sounds like the family could well afford higher education and she had no interest in pursuing those opportunities, but was all over having a three-day wedding in Italy at 17.\n\nedit: a word", "Interesting.  You either have insider knowledge or are a marvelous storyteller inside that brain of yours.", "Parents who want her gone.", "Maybe they\u2019re tired of taking care of her", "My guess is that the parents want her to move out and hope to shame OP into keeping her for the foreseeable future.", "Shipping it back sends a very clear message.", "Except to stake out the room\u2026", "Plus who is taking care of her daughter while she's in NYC? Perhaps the father or her parents???", "Are you saying I'm lying? Read the post again and stop acting like I made shit up when everything I said is literally right there, I just reaffirmed it. Lacking formal education isn't an excuse to act like an ass.", "You are on the money.The parent -in -laws thought they had a way of losing the bratty SIL.", "Jetblue has really cheap nonstop flights from NY to NM.", "I went to a 3 day wedding in Cannes only for the couple to divorce one year later.", "Guess mommy and daddy should have sprung for the 50 day wedding!", "Gotta love the symmetry.", "Someone I know beat this, they didn't even get divorced it was annulled.  \nIt was 3 days officially, but there were 2 extra days of catamaran, golfing, tours etc if you traveled internationally that the groom's family also paid for.", "parents are probably pushing the husband to spend time with her till she decides to stay in NYC. Of course he plan will be partying it up till she accidentally gets pregnant again then somehow this will be husband and ops to finance.\n\nThe fact that the rest of the family are upset they are basically not letting her move in makes me think that entire side of the family is done with her bullshit. While she's in town they feel obligated for all the babysitting, cooking, support they give, if she's a flight away then they are no longer obligated. OP and husband are getting in the way of their plan to get shot of her.", "Well I got married in my parents living room with 30 guests. We couldn\u2019t even fit chairs, folks just crowded around, so I guess I\u2019ll be married forever \ud83e\udd23.", "We spent less than 10K - way less - and we're at 28 years, so there may be some truth in that!", "Hmm, my mother\u2019s fifth wedding was in front of a JP witnessed by just 2 of her 4 kids, and it barely lasted a year. But maybe that\u2019s just her; she ended her sixth marriage last year and started this year by getting back together with number four", "I think it is really about overspending. If you have a ton of money, an over the top wedding isn't indicative of anything but a champagne budget. But overspending beyond your means to make a big splash seems to indicate some level of insecurity in the relatiomship.", "Ours cost $35.00 (licence and justice of the peace). We're at less than a buck a year now!", "Usually comes down to going deeply into debt and letting too many outside people dictate what urnwedding \"needs\" to have. Makes u lose sight of y u r actually there.", "To be fair, that's a lot even *not* adjusted for inflation...", "That's what I spent on my first, made it exactly 4 years. Spent less than $100 on this one, still going strong 15+.", "My wife and I spent about $70 on our wedding, or about $400 in current terms. That was in 1971, and we're coming up on our 52nd anniversary next month.", "Me too! We were able to fit the chairs but just barely \ud83d\ude06", "That was my first, a Jerry Springer reception. My second we got the license and married in the courthouse. Had a beer at the bar after and went on our merry way. We're going strong still 15+ years later.", "That was about what we spent. Got married in MIL's back yard.  34 years.", "My parents spent the money for a license, a small \u201cregular\u201d cake from the grocery store bakery to stand in as a wedding cake and gas money on a 2 hour drive to be married at my dad\u2019s parents house (dad\u2019s parents were very poor and couldn\u2019t afford to come to my parent\u2019s town). my mom\u2019s parents and sisters drove to my dad\u2019s parents for the wedding. My mom was surprised and pleased that dad\u2019s mom had put together a surprise of a small little reception with punch, finger foods. Dad passed away the day before they would\u2019ve been together 50 years.", "I spent about $300, got married at city hall, had dinner at a restaurant, and went to work the next day, 47 years ago"]}
