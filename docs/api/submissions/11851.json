Great family, open adoption. Baby's parents - not mine - went to the appointments and were in the delivery room with me. They have been 100% Baby's parents from the start.\n\nI moved away after the birth, forward with life, and became a decent adult. Baby's parents adopted additional children from overseas. Communication shifted a few times, landing with my father as intermediary.\n\nMy father is useless (total failure to launch). He knew the parents from social circles, it made sense at the time. Unknown to me or the adoptive parents  my father decided the information was just for him.\n\nThe spring of Baby's high school graduation I started asking about plans. I was reassured I would be updated when there was information. Baby wasn't quite 18, the terms of the adoption dictated none of us could approach the other directly.\n\nGraduation came and went. I cried for weeks... sobbed to my father, and his mother, accepted the outcome of my decision to provide my only child with a life I couldn't. \n\nGraduation was May, my father's birthday is June. I called to wish him a happy birthday and he let it slip he attended Baby's graduation. Much anger and hurt later, it turns out Baby invited me to the graduation wanting it to be our introduction. My father kept it for himself and went instead.\n\nMy father died to me that day.\nYes, I am better off without him.\n\nDespite my feelings, Baby has always been encouraged to develop their own relationships. My father turned Baby into a replacement for the children he paid zero attention to. That's our burden, not Baby's.\n\nBaby and I connected when they turned 18. A college career later, Baby's parents and I have become Team Kids. I stay at their house when I am in town.\n\nCollege graduation is nearly upon us. Baby is visiting for Spring Break. I am honored. \n\nParent's day at Baby's Greek house in April. It's a odd but Baby wants me there, so I'll go.\n\nGraduation is another matter. Baby is limited to 4 tickets, those are for Baby's parents and siblings. There is no ticket to the ceremony for me. There is zero anyone can do about the tickets. \n\nThe ceremony is a Saturday, the Sunday is Mother's Day - I don't belong at their Mother's Day. It feels like an intrusion and insensitive to Baby's siblings.\n\nI will fly in to wave them off, hang around campus alone, then congratulating them on the ride to the airport home.\n\nBaby's Open House is the next weekend. I will fly back to help set up, stay to help clean, then fly home. My father may attend, he is the only living grandparent from any source. I expect him to behave as the deprived, hard-done-by, doting grandparent. I'll be stuck. A scene, even if it is just because I leave, will make me TA.\n\nI am debating not attending the graduation ceremony weekend. It's the only place I can limit the damage to me as a human. I am already breaking my soul, sanity, and bank account to attend the other events.", "created_utc": 1678345674, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11mlmjc/wibta_if_i_dont_attend_my_childs_college/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And see what baby says. \n\nAlso- if the parents don\u2019t know what grandpa pulled, they should. It sounds like the three of you have built a good thing with a lot of mutual respect.

You don\u2019t need to do anything, baby doesn\u2019t need to know or do anything, I just want you to know this happened so you are not caught off guard by the distance I maintain with him now.\u201d If they value you, they will understand. And I would hope they would be supportive. \n\nAlso- if no one told you lately: you did a really hard and amazing thing when you gave up baby. You matter. Your feelings right now matter.", "NTA at all. You have made so many difficult decisions. I think its beautiful that you have accepted Babys choices and decisions in all of this - and respected Babys parents while they were a minor. All of that, I imagine, was difficult. \n\nYou are trying not to hurt yourself by going and dealing with someone who hurt you deeply and continually. I think not going is smart - celebrate next time you see Baby, without your father present. \n\nThey may be upset, but they will come to understand.", "NTA. I'm an adopted child that also had a great adoptive family. But I would so much love to meet my birth parents, if even once. Your baby is blessed to have both a great adoptive family and you. It must be so heartbreaking for you however. But still, if you can bring yourself to go I would. But if you don't you're not even a little bit an AH at all.", "YWNBTA in my opinion, because of your last sentence. Would caveat though with the fact that you should tell Baby why, that you're incredibly proud of them and buy Baby a meal or a small gift or something to express your pride in some other way.", "NTA. You are an amazingly considerate person.", " YWNBTA- your father is, and  I do understand why you feel as you do.  Ultimately you are showing up for baby and though it will be hard seeing the selfish man that robbed you of that first meeting that you can never have back and also failed you as a father watching you cry for weeks over a thing he had secretly done. Deplorable. Ultimately it is your call and you know what you can and can\u2019t handle.", "Absolutely NTA you are an amazingly kind person. You took one of the hardest decisions that can be made and you're still only thinking about babies needs 18 years later. Keep being you OP you give me hope for humanity", "YWBTA if you didn\u2019t attend. The event is ultimately for her, not you. She seems to want you there and the right thing to do would be to push this turmoil under the rug for her day. \n\nIf your father tries to prod you, do not engage. If you ignore it or walk away you will turn out looking better in the end. It\u2019s also the best response in the situation for her.", "NTA. Go to the open house and congratulate baby on their graduation then. There is no reason to fly in the week before to just wave a greeting but not actually attend anything!", "NTA you are already doing the best you can. Take care of you so you can be loving to the world around you.", "You are an amazingly selfless human. NTA in any way shape or form. \n\nPlease remember that you cannot help anyone else unless you put your own mask on first. Take care of your heart and set your boundaries first and foremost.

It's different thing to say I cant emotionally withstand it. But you definitely do belong if you are an invited guest and everyone knows you're coming and probably looking forward to it. I know you hate your father and you have a VERY valid reason to be NC but if it's inevitable that you will see each other there it may be worth it to hash something out with him before these momentous days. It sounds to me like a recipe for disaster to wait for when you see him and risk leaving in tears etc. and taking away from the days for Baby. Also, I really urge you to talk to a therapist. I can hear how heartbroken you are about this very complex situation. Sending a big hug your way.  \n\n\nETA: Also, it seems strange to me that there is no waiting list for additional tickets. I have a masters degree and at all of my graduations, including the one at a very large university, there was a waiting list for extra tickets and I got at least one each time."]}
