Being an ex is a two-way street.  My Aunt P and Uncle G divorced when I was in my mid-teens (I'll be 52 next month).  You might notice I still refer to him as Uncle G.  When my aunt decided to move, he had right of first refusal on their home (which she got in the divorce).  He made every payment on time (usually early and always more than the stated amount).  When she got cancer in 1996 (she discovered the lump the same day she found out her second husband was a cheating jerk), Uncle G called me practically every two minutes while she was in surgery, checking on her (despite the fact that he was remarried).  He sent her a cookie bouquet because he remembered she liked sugar cookies and he hoped they would stimulate her appetite.  When my grandmother passed away, he sent sympathy cards to my aunt and my mom.  When my mom had cancer, he checked in with me regularly to make sure she was doing okay.  For my parents 50th wedding anniversary, he sent a lovely bouquet, a beautiful card, and a gift certificate to a really nice restaurant he remembered they liked.  My aunt's second husband?  The cheating jerk?  I've never called him Uncle.  I told him flat out not to apply for a teaching position at the university I graduated from because I would personally contact every member of the faculty senate and let them know he slept with his TA.\n\nIf your (ex) uncle chooses to be uncivil to your mother, there's no reason for you to be civil to him.", "NTA!

When you grow a bit older you will see value in his words.
