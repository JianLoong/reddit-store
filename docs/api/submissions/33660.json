But my sister (19MTF) is transgender, and tells me it makes her dysphoric when I perform. \n\nSome back story; I first began experimenting with drag back when I was still in high school, doing the Rocky Horror Picture Show. After I graduated,  I practiced my makeup and performing, made some connections, and eventually began doing small shows around town. I got pretty good at it, and and have started getting better jobs. I see this as a genuine potential career path. I've made a lot of connections and most of my friends through drag.\n\n2 years ago, my younger sister came out to me as transgender. I've always been supportive, and she often refers to me as her \"rock.\" My family is very tight-knit, but my sister and I always been especially close, and I even got some blame from my family for \"influencing her gender confusion\" with my drag, before my family came around. At this point, my family is very close again, and supportive of both me and my sister, though I admit it was rough to start.\n\nAbout a month ago, my sister called and told me she doesn't want me to do drag anymore. She says that the problem is that I get a lot of praise for it, and people often tell me that I make a very pretty woman. According to her, some people have even compared her appearance unfavorably to my drag persona.\n\nI think that's terrible, and I told her as much. I genuinely do sympathize with her, but I drew the line when she asked her to stop doing drag. She told me it triggers her dysphoria severely, and that if I was really supportive I would stop. I told her what a big part of my life it is, but she told me that she should be a bigger part of my life. \n\nThe thing is, my sister and I have always looked a lot alike, and the only reason anybody would think I look \"better\" than her is because I wear a ton of makeup when I'm in drag. My sister usually wears very little, if any. I've offered to teach her how to do it herself, but she refuses. She tells me that she doesn't need makeup to be a woman, and does not owe anybody feminine presentation. And I agree! She doesn't want to be seen as a stereotype, and I respect that. \n\nI don't want to make my sister upset, and I don't want her to feel any emotional or mental distress, but I also love drag. It's such a huge part of my life, that I genuinely don't think I could give it up at this point. Especially since I think there is genuine potential for a career for me in the world of drag. That's why, when pressed for an answer, I refused to quit.\n\nI thought I did the right thing, but now, I'm not as sure. My mom even told me that, while she won't tell me what to do, agree feels I should \"seriously reconsider,\" because I'm her big brother, and should put my family before my ambitions. I love my sister very much, but I think it's unreasonable for her to ask me to give up doing what I love.

She\u2019s asking you to stop doing a job you love that could turn into a career. The easiest solution here is for her to not go to your drag shows and unfollow you on whichever social media you post drag stuff on. It won\u2019t stop other peoples comments but she won\u2019t have to see a hyper feminized version of herself. Is there a possibility of you guys going to family therapy? Having continuing conversations about this is probably the only way you guys will still have a strong relationship without resenting each other. Right now she resents you but if you stop doing drag you\u2019ll probably grow to resent her for it. The most you should reasonably be expected to do is not be around her in drag or send her photos or videos of you in drag. Which you may already be doing. To be blunt, it\u2019s her problem that she needs to work through and find coping strategies for. You can and should continue to support her but you don\u2019t have to change a big part of your life to make her happy.", "I'm sure you are a very pretty drag queen, but to my probably imperfect understanding,drag queens aren't trying to pass as women. I don't get how that triggers her dysphoria.\n\nI can see how maybe she could get jealous of the praise you get, but I don't think quitting drag is going to eliminate that. It sounds like an issue she needs to work through in therapy.\n\nNTA", " Drag is a huge part of your life and who you are now. Asking you to quit, is asking you to give up a part of yourself. \n\nINFO: Would you be able to wake up and be okay knowing you can't do drag anymore?", "NTA. Your commitment to drag isn't just a hobby; it's a profound expression of your identity and creativity, and it holds significant importance in the LGBTQ+ community, especially for gay men. It's a space where you've found not just your voice, but a community and a potential career. Your sister's feelings are valid and important, but her dysphoria, as painful as it is, isn't something you can control or cure by sacrificing a part of who you are. It's crucial to be supportive and empathetic to her struggles, but not at the expense of erasing your own identity and passions.\n\nYou've offered solutions, like teaching her makeup, showing that you're trying to be considerate and helpful without giving up a vital part of your life. Your role as her brother is to support and love her, but you also have the right to pursue your own happiness and career. It's a delicate balance, but one that requires understanding from both sides. Encourage her to seek support from those who understand her experience, and perhaps explore ways you can both enjoy your identities without infringing on each other's happiness. Your love and support as her brother are invaluable, but so is living your truth.", "It sounds, unfortunately, like a one sided relationship. Stop doing something you love that gives you belonging because I am uncomfortable\u2026 I think if she were really supportive of YOU she would deal with her own issues", "NTA. It is a bit weird though that she doesn\u2019t want a feminine presentation, but gets upset when people say your drag persona looks \u201cbetter\u201d. I totally get that she doesn\u2019t owe anyone anything, and perhaps people should keep some of those opinions to themselves, but she shouldn\u2019t be surprised when it happens", "NTA. If your sister doesn\u2019t like it, she doesn\u2019t have to see it. She is trying to force you into not doing something that makes you happy because of her own emotions. This is very controlling, and she needs to take into account that the world doesn\u2019t revolve around her dysphoria, and she also needs to go to therapy to talk about how to quell these feelings because the world isn\u2019t going to constantly bend to her will.\n\nAlso, your family should *not* come before your ambitions. You are allowed to have ambitions and goals! Everyone is human and deserves to have their own dreams. It is up to you to decide whether to follow a goal or stick by your family, and neither is necessarily right or wrong in this scenario.", "She doesn\u2019t have to go to your shows.", "I feel for your sister. But she is going to meet a great many people in life with diverse gender experiences, presentations, and participations (including other trans folks who are drag performers!) and her solution to any resulting dysphoria cannot always be to ask them to stop living their own authentic lives so that she can live hers. The feelings she is experiencing are not the fault of yourself and others who she may be compared to or compare herself to. They are the fault of people who feel it appropriate to compare her beauty to others, and the fault of the shame that many trans folks feel from outside factors as they journey through transition and selfhood. She's going to need to find ways to see her own beauty and value independent of others.\n\nI hope one day the both of you feel that your happy lives are reflections of yourselves and your joys, not of each others' perceived failings.", "NTA. Fellow queen and also trans here. Finally something I can weigh in on with personal experience! \n\nYour sister can set boundaries. Realistic boundaries would be \u201cHey, going to your shows makes my dysphoria skyrocket, so I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t come to support you.\u201d  That would be reasonable. \n\nBut telling you what to do goes beyond that, she is making rules. And that\u2019s not fair. You can explain the boundaries vs rules thing if you think that\u2019ll get her to understand that she can\u2019t tell other people to stop doing something because she feels bad about herself. It\u2019s kind of like hardcore religious people telling others they can\u2019t have abortions or do drag or whatever else with their own bodies - you can\u2019t dictate what others do, period. Is she going to tell other drag queens around her to stop doing it because it makes her uncomfortable? What is her end game here, tell Ru to cancel Drag Race? Is she aware that there are TONS of transfemme drag queens? Bottom line, it\u2019s on her to remove herself from triggers, not to eradicate them from the world.  \n\nIt sounds like you\u2019ve tried hard to include her, like offering to teach her makeup, you\u2019re being a supportive older sibling. But something inside her is still not at peace. And unfortunately that\u2019s on her to resolve and not you. You can try to explain that separating you from your beloved creative expression will hurt you. And assuming she loves you as family she should understand this. Although it looks like you\u2019ve tried and she pushed back on it. \n\nHonestly I think she\u2019s being selfish here, but no judgment because finding yourself when trans is painful and she\u2019s lashing out to the closest thing she *thinks* is causing the pain (you, but in reality, it is not you). I\u2019ve had to come to terms with my own gender presentation over the years. She is still REALLY young. I wasn\u2019t totally comfortable with my gender situation at that age either but I\u2019m much more secure in myself past 30. I think if you give her time to find herself it\u2019s going to help.\n\nIn the short-term, just trying to keep it away from her might help. Like not showing her pictures or being around her in drag, maybe getting her to block you on social media (and every other drag queen, I guess?).\n\nPS. your Reddit name wins", "NTA. She can take steps to avoid what is making her uncomfortable--unfollowing your drag social media, not going to your shows. She could even ask you to be sensitive about talking about it around her for awhile since it's affecting her. Those would all be fair. Asking you to quit? Not ok.", "Nta- it isn\u2019t mentioned how you dressing in drag is getting to her, this is important. Cause you should continue to do as you like when not with your sister, and she doesn\u2019t need to know everything you do when not with her.", "NTA. She is still quote young and early in her transition, so there are likely a lot of raw, unsettled emotions for her. These are not your problem. Your existence and happiness are not so easily expendable to appease her. She does not have to watch your shows, follow your social media, or anything like that. If she\u2019s still seeing a therapist, she should really be discussing her feelings about this with them. I don\u2019t think any rational therapist would agree with her \u201csolution\u201d to the problem.", "I don't think she is the asshole for feeling dysphoric from drag but she is for demanding you quit - NTA", "NTA.   Your sister needs to address her issues for herself, not force others around her to give up doing things they love.   If you really want to put family before your ambitions, you can do so by encouraging her to seek the professional help she needs.", "Nta, this is something they need to work out on their own. You don't need to stop doing drag.", "NTA. This is an example of understandable triggering but still her problem to deal with.\n\nDoing drag is a big part of your life and you like it. You shouldn't stop living your life(legal and moral) just because it's triggering to someone, even your own sister. This is something she needs to adress in therapy.", "NTA\n\n  \nYOur sister is the AH - she would be fine to stay away, but she has no right to tell you how to live YOUR life.\n\n  \nso:\\_ You are right to refuse.", "NTA. Your sister needs to get over herself. You are not responsible for her emotions. She needs to deal with her own insecurities and not fob it off on to someone else. Basic adult stuff.", "NTA, unless you're coming in drag to family events where your sister is present! She can just avoid looking at photos/videos of you performing, and anyone who would unfavorably compare her appearance to yours isn't a friend.

It's a tricky situation and if I were you I'd stop mentioning it to her but obviously keep doing your own thing out there.", "NTA. Did I miss the part where you both live at home,  you get ready to perform at home, and then the main show is in the living room,  ergo your sister can't avoid seeing you in drag and performing?", "Side note: does she not realize that most women don't look like drag queens?...seriously, most cis women aren't dolling themselves up like that every day.\n\nNTA.

Yet, *her unhappiness does not trump* your right to your happiness.", "Sounds like she\u2019s jealous, not dysphoric, but I\u2019m in no position to judge at all. \n\nShe should not watch you perform and unfollow you on SM. Done and dusted.\n\nNTA", "Drag performers are much better at gender presentation than a lot of people of the gender are.  Partly that's because it's an exaggeration, partly because they actually want to do all that stuff.  A lot of us who grew up female  are just bewildered by it all.  I realize now that every time I put on full make up and a dress it was a performance.  Though according to my mom my clothes were always costumes.", "I don't think I could.

This might make me an asshole but you've done everything you could up to this point to be supportive. At some point, she has to learn how to handle her reaction to her triggers. Her triggers are not your responsibility. I know you love her and want to be supportive but asking to give up a part of who you are isn't fair or right.", "It doesn't sound like she loves you like you love her. She doesn't love you for who you are like you love her for who she is. NTA Stand your ground. Don't set yourself on fire to keep her warm.", "You are not responsible for her emotions.", "So here is the thing about triggers (whether triggers of dysphoria or other things), some can be avoided without too much cost and others have to eventually be worked through and dealt with because the impact of avoiding comes at a significant price. The process of working through it can hurt and be painful, but that doesn\u2019t mean avoiding it is going to work long-term. Sometimes things in life hurt. That\u2019s just an unfortunate truth. \n\nYou can work to minimize her exposure to this particular trigger (example: not talk about it a ton around her, not expect her to come to your performances, create separate social media to share anything drag-related and understand if she does not follow you on that, shut down conversations with family when they bring it up, etc.). Meanwhile she can continue to work on her own sensitivity to this particular trigger through therapy. The goal being that the two of you can continue to exist as supportive siblings. However, at the point that she\u2019s controlling others\u2019 behavior, she\u2019s not handling her trigger well and it\u2019s clear this is one where forcing others to comply so that she can avoid doesn\u2019t work. In other words, her expectations of you are unfair. She\u2019s asking you to stop doing something that is integral to your identity. This is actually not that different than it would be if you asked her to stop presenting in a certain way because it upsets you. Think for a minute about how she\u2019d react if you insisted on her changing a part of herself for you. If you think she\u2019d take that poorly, you\u2019ll quickly see how inappropriate she\u2019s being by requesting this.\n\nIt may help to think about it more like a trauma trigger. If you had a sibling who was attacked by a dog and is triggered by seeing dogs it would be perfectly reasonable for you to not bring your dog to their house, to meet them in public spaces rather than have them over where the dog lives, or even to avoid talking about your dog when around them. It would be unreasonable for them to expect you to re-home your dog and never have a dog again, even if you one day fell in love with a Veterinarian, had a kid who needed a service dog, etc. Furthermore, since it\u2019s very hard to just avoid all dogs in this world, the expectation would eventually be that they do the internal work to be able to handle occasionally having a dog in their vicinity.  No one should ever expect them to get a dog or dog sit for you. But they wouldn\u2019t expect you to be forced to live a dog free life so that she can try to avoid ever experiencing a trigger in any way, shape, or form.\n\nIn other words, it\u2019s okay if she\u2019s at a stage in her own identity formation where she\u2019s not okay around drag and, in particular, you in drag and there are ways to be understanding and supportive of that. It\u2019s not okay for her to dictate how others live and move through the world because she is experiencing distress and dysphoria. This is a sign for her that there is stuff she is going to need to work on. It may take years and may not be linear. And that\u2019s okay. None of us can fully avoid emotional distress and upset at times in this world. Working through it may be distressing, but it doesn\u2019t mean that enabling her to avoid that work is actually helping (hint: your mom is trying to take this path). \n\nHer triggers are not your responsibility to manage. They are hers. You can help and support her, but you cannot let them control your life. Quite frankly, she shouldn\u2019t even be letting her triggers control her life, at least not long-term.\n\nOther people unfavorably comparing the two of you is about those people and the solution is to set boundaries with those people who are making such comments. As an aside, I\u2019d be shocked if the kind of people comparing actually stop merely because you stop engaging in drag. They\u2019ll just compare her to how you used to look. If family members were saying you were the smarter sibling because you were in graduate school and she wasn\u2019t, the solution to mitigate hurt with those family members would never be for you to drop out of grad school or never get work using your degree. The solution would be for all of you to tell those family members their comments are hurtful and either make them stop or set limits regarding how and when you see them if they refuse to stop.\n\nThis should have been a wake-up call for her that she needs to get control of this particular trigger, not that she gets to dictate how you do things to help her avoid it.\n\nNAH, if only because it is really hard to be triggered and have to work through that and she is a teenager, so it makes sense that she thinks the easier path is asking you to give this up and it even makes sense that your mom is desperately trying to support her. Your mom is probably scared for her well-being and overall safety to a level where it\u2019s hard for her to see how unfair this is. Teenagers are pretty notorious for having trouble understanding that the world is not there to cater to them/ doesn\u2019t revolve around them and a lot of teenagers these days have been taught that everything should contain a \u201ctrigger warning\u201d and that they should expect the world to help them avoid any triggers. Your mom probably knows a lot about the ways your sister is vulnerable and is therefore viewing this as prioritizing her mental health. The problem is, neither of them are thinking clearly about the impact on you, your relationship with her, or of the long-term impacts of not working on the things that trigger her dysphoria. If they keep pushing on this then they veer into asshole territory. This is \u201clet\u2019s talk to a therapist and make a plan to limit the impact of this on you until you\u2019re ready time.\u201d", "I appreciate you looking out, but she is okay with them/them pronouns.", "??? They used they? It\u2019s a gender neutral term, oh look I just used they there without thinking about it, if it were male pronouns I would understand correction? but gender neutral?", "This was long, but also the best, most comprehensive, well thought out comment/response I've ever read on Reddit.", "I did use she in my post, but my sister, by pure coincidence, does use she/they pronouns. I appreciate you both looking out though. No big deal.", "NTA. She\u2019s asking you to give up a huge part of *your identity, something that seemingly predates her transgender coming out. I think rather than asking you to stop she could work on improving her mental health and the roots of her issues with your drag.", "NTA. She doesn\u2019t owe anyone wearing make up or being female in a way that others would do. I\u2019m CIS female, and I guarantee that when you\u2019re in drag you\u2019re prettier than me. And that\u2019s ok! You\u2019re performing, of course you\u2019re going to look amazing! Just like people at the Oscars are going to look amazing. I rarely wear make up. I dress comfortably. That\u2019s ok, just like you looking amazing in drag is ok, too. Your sister doesn\u2019t have to wear make up or dress up. Being female, you have to learn to accept that some women are prettier, just like some are smarter or funnier or more athletic. You have to learn to appreciate that about them, and realize that every single one of them feels like they\u2019re not good enough in some way. And there are going to be a zillion ads that try to reinforce that. And you\u2019re going to have insecure people that want to prey on not feeling enough because they think it hides how they feel. Which is why it feels so nice when another woman compliments you. You know she has her insecurities, and she knows you have yours, but she\u2019s highlighting something good.", "NTA. Speaking as a trans girl, the biggest dysphoria trigger is stupid comments by ignorant people, which is exactly what happened here. The problem isn't you, it's whoever made those comments to her. After all, she's known you were a Queen for years without an issue, right? I'd ask her who's making the comparisons, and probably go no contact with them.", "Fuck your sister, this kind of self centred bullshit only hurts the perception of the trans community.\n\nOr this is bait.", "Here's the thing--as a woman myself, I abhor drag shows *because* of reasons discussed in the OP. I don't wear a lot of make up, there rarely are drag queens that wear jeans and a sports jersey as opposed to dresses, and often times it seems (to me) to just be a stereotype of what people think women *should* be instead of the variety of different women there are in the world. \n\nThat being said, would I go up to a drag performer and tell them to stop doing drag? No. \n\nIs it possible to compromise? Maybe continue to do drag but lean more toward a 'tomboy-ish/blue collar' drag queen? The heavy makeup may not be able to be avoided (having done theater, I know for performances it's important in order to be seen from the stage and avoid being washed out) but it may help your sister and avoid conflict within your family. \n\nAs for a rating...I don't have one. I think this may be beyond Reddit's pay grade :)", "NTA, this is a \"her problem\". This is her issue with herself and/or the people around her. She needs to speak up for herself, seek professional help, cut out those who hurt her, etc. That's like telling other people they can't be apart of blank religion, talk about their pregnancy/kids, or talk about their life achievements.", "NTA.\n\nAll she has to do is not attend your performances. That way she doesn't see you in drag and won't get triggered.\n\nIt is absolutely ridiculous to expect you to walk away from that whole world / community / career you've been part of simply because she refuses to deal with what is essentially a Her problem. Your Mom is also out of line.", "NTA\n\nYou can't manage your sister's feelings for her.  That's something she needs to do on her own.", "NTA  As a FTM I'm very familiar with dysphoria. However your life shouldn't come to a halt for your sisters condition. It's something she's working though. I don't think even if you quit drag it would help the situation. Sounds more like she's experiencing misogyny for not being 'the perfect women'. Even if you quit there will more then likely be someone else to make her feel like this down the road. \n\nI couldn't tell you the solution to this. Everyone is a bit different. She could need to just build some confidence in herself. So when people mention how you look better she has confidence in herself to let it roll off. Granted it would help if people were a little more understanding of the situation and not saying things like this in general.", "NTA. I'm trans (ftm) and I do drag and i cosplay characters of all genders, I can understand where your sister is coming from with her feelings of dysphoria/jealousy, but \"secondhand dysphoria\" is not an excuse to tell people they have to stop doing/acting/dressing in a certain way. For example, I don't tell my cisgender brother he has to stop going shirtless at the beach because it makes me dysphoric, things like that are my own problem to deal with, not his. \n\nDoing drag and being a trans person trying to \"pass\" are two entirely different realms of dressing/acting/being, look at any of the cis woman queens out there. Your sister is right that she doesn't have to wear makeup to be a woman, and I think your offer of teaching her makeup skills is kind. \n\nThe comparison between women who do and don't wear makeup/dress up is something that happens between cisgender women all the time, I see it often with my cousins (the one who wears makeup/does her hair is praised for her appearance while the one who wears an equally-dressy outfit but without makeup does not), this is an issue with society as a whole, not you and her personally.", "NTA It would be the same as you asking your sister to not be trans, which you would never do, because it\u2019s who she is and makes her happy. She should get therapy for her dysphoria instead of projecting it on to you. She needs to learn she can\u2019t control other peoples lives instead of dealing with her own issues. \n\nAsk her to break down specifically what the trigger is, is it the confidence, makeup, level of feminisation, etc, and support her through working through that issue. Even if you stopped doing drag (which you shouldn\u2019t and wouldn\u2019t), the issue will still be there unless she identifies it and does the work to feel differently.", "It's not your fault other people are assholes. Is there a way you can help your sister shut down the insensitive comments? Does she let people know it bothers her? Some people can be genuinely clueless how hurtful their comments are, but will be more mindful if told. If there is a friend overlap you may be able to tell them to knock it off and keep the looks comparisons to themselves. If they don't knock it off, then you should both consider dropping people who won't stfu out of your lives.", "That\n\n\n\"I realize now that every time I put on full make up and a dress it was a preformance\"\n\n\n\n\nSpoke to me.\n\n\n\n\nAnd i was so much happier when i stopped performing. 30 years ago people would give you hell for not being feminine.  Some do today but not like back then.", "What a compassionate and eloquent analysis of the situation.", "Have my happily provided upvote. You explained this so very well. I hope that anyone else in a similar situation as OP reads this, studies this, practices this and internalizes your advice. From the very depths of my cis female being, thank you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOP, you have to continue to be you. Your sister needs to continue being her.  It may get a bit bumpy, but you'll both make the trip.  NAH", "Beautifully said. Wow.", "its gender neutral until you know the gender, then its purposefully misgendering them (if they dont use them, op says she does so this is a moot point)", "Welp, one comes with the other.", "[removed]", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).
