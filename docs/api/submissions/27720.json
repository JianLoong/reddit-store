This is to the point that even walking makes me feel dizzy and like I\u2019m going to faint, so I\u2019ve been staying in my room.\n\nI mentioned this to my parents, and they insisted on sending me lots of food and Gatorade to help me feel better. I said no, for a couple reasons: 1) I feel nauseous as is, more food is no good 2) the campus is huge and grocery/DoorDash delivery always only comes to the other end of the campus (entrance) and can\u2019t find my room. As mentioned, even walking hurts so I\u2019m not in any state to make that trek. \n\nI explained this clearly, and they said okay. 20 minutes later they called me saying they ordered food for me that\u2019s arriving in 30 minutes and I should go pick it up. This frustrated me, because they always do this and ignore my boundaries, then blame me. For example they would always ask if I wanted ice cream or pizza or something, I\u2019d say no, they\u2019d buy me food and then yell at me when I wouldn\u2019t eat it.\n\nSo I told them in no uncertain terms I would not be going to pick it up. They asked if I could get a friend to, and I said I could but I won\u2019t because my parents need to learn what no means.\n\nThey got angry and started shouting at me that I\u2019m TA for letting $70 worth of food go to waste. I think it\u2019s on them for ordering food when I said in no uncertain terms to begin with I didn\u2019t want it.", "created_utc": 1695775315, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16t5mb4/aitaa_brat_for_refusing_to_pick_up_70_worth_of/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I read your comments, you\u2019re also a brat.", "ESH but I\u2019m leaning towards NTA because OP said their parents use their generosity against them to avoid acknowledging that they need therapy/other mental health supports. I don\u2019t think OP should\u2019ve wasted the food but the parents sound worse.", "ESH. You were gifted $70 bucks of food and didn\u2019t let anyone have it. College kids are poor as shit and you could have let someone else eat. I would have been apoplectic if you were my dorm neighbor and I heard about this loss. 70 bucks in lost food is a huge deal in your environment. \n\nParents suck for not respecting boundaries, although less so than you because their intentions are good.", "YTA for your insistence that the food rot. I get that you\u2019re annoyed but this is not that serious and you\u2019re being very dramatic. Your parents being a little intense with their kind and well meaning gestures is not the worst problem to have.", "ESH. They do need to respect boundaries, but that\u2019s $70 worth of usable food.

You\u2019re a freshman in college meaning if you\u2019re aware you need help with your mental health, GET IT. There are multiple free resources at your disposal.

You\u2019re out here wasting $70 worth of groceries.\n\nYour parents should understand boundaries, but I don\u2019t even understand why you\u2019re being a brat over acts of kindness.", "YTA for wasting all that food just to \"prove a point\"", "ESH. Your parents should take no for an answer. You should learn to set actual boundaries instead of being petty. \n\nCausing your parents the most \u201cpain\u201d possible by letting the food rot doesn\u2019t make it more likely that they will respect your boundaries in the future. You didn\u2019t \u201cteach them a lesson,\u201d you just reinforced the narrative they already have in their heads about you\u2014that you are an ungrateful, immature brat.\n\nYou seem to recognize this is a trend with your parents. Once they told you the unwelcome Gatorade train was coming you should have told them again that you were not well enough to pick it up, ended your conversation with them, and offered the groceries to friends. If your parents ask about it in the future, you simply tell them again that you weren\u2019t well enough to get the groceries, you told them you did not want the items, and you aren\u2019t going to discuss it any further. End of story. This is a boundary they can\u2019t stomp.

It\u2019s a *huge* pet peeve of mine whenever people waste food. You should\u2019ve asked a friend to collect it. If your parents are longtime boundary stompers then this is hardly going to teach them the lesson you want", "YTA for letting the food go to waste. I was on your side until I saw your comments doubling down that it had to spoil. They could\u2019ve gotten the idea by you saying you let a stranger or friend have it.", "YTA.  I can understand that you were not in a condition to get the groceries, but to not ask a friend was immature.

Entitled is easy when you have cash.", "I don't understand what you were even doing calling your parents and telling them this if you hate them to the extent you say you do in the comments, and you're on a full ride scholarship and not dependent on them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis feels like some weird fic. YTA but also probably making it up.", "On the one hand you\u2019ve been adapting to shitty parents and focusing on survival. Rebelling is a way to keep your spirit intact.

First come, first serve.\u201d \n\nI GUARANTEE that your parents would be just as pissed about that. \u201cOh, you want to know how the food was? The food I couldn\u2019t physically walk to in order to pick up? I posted on the school Reddit where it was, I assume someone else who needed it made use of it.

Next time, do the right thing and call a friend--or an enemy, or a food bank--to let them know where they can pick up the food and keep it for themselves.", "YTA. Undeniably. You\u2019re even more TA for having someone else come and try and justify this ridiculous waste. \n\nYou know who you taught a lesson to? \nNobody. \n\nYou certainly know someone who could have used that food. You\u2019re a college kid. You quite literally cut off your nose to spite your face. You wasted food, you wasted someone else\u2019s money. Any amount of setting boundaries doesn\u2019t justify the selfishness you displayed knowing that there are people at your school who could have used that 70$ of groceries.", "NTA I feel ya. The only way to get that stuff to stop is not accepting it and not giving an inch. It'll only get worse as you get older if you don't put a stop to it.", "I mean this with all of the kindness in the world: you need to get over yourself. Lying to them about the food going to waste and letting a friend take it would have been the right move. With toxic and abusive parents, you NEED to learn to be okay with lying. You stuck it to your parents, but you also let a ton of food go to waste in the process. I\u2019m sure it felt good, because being petty to people who hurt you tends to feel good, but you could have taught them a lesson while doing a nice thing for someone else. No judgment because you\u2019re obviously upset right now and will probably look at this with a cooler head later.", "Info: what kind of car did your parents buy you?", "Why didn't they cancel the order?  Too close to delivery?", "Usually when you are given a generous gift like free groceries you say Thankyou, you don\u2019t get mad you need to walk 100 meters with a cold and yell over it. YTA.", "NTA\n\nAnd I\u2019m extremely anti food-waste.  But you are fine to set your boundaries here. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want it\u201d means no. Your parents are now responsible for the food waste and financial loss because it was their choice to send you something they knew you didn\u2019t want.", "YTA for letting the food go to waste\n\nNTA for trying to set boundaries on your parents", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "NTA you said no multiple times it seems and yet they went and did it anyway. It\u2019s their fault for ignoring you and ordering that stuff despite you saying no and refusing to get it.", "Just here to say I wish I had parents like this lol", "NTA. The food going to waste sucks, yeah, and I think you should have let someone know like \"hey, there's free food there if anyone wants to have it.\" However, you clearly stated you didn't want it, you had a perfectly valid reason for not wanting it, and your parents ignored that. They decided they wanted to be able to pat themselves on the back for taking care of their sick kid ignoring that they were causing said sick kid more stress and asking you to go walking all about campus while you're sick. If they do it again though, offer up the food to someone else and let your parents know you gave it away to a random person. That'll still upset them, and you won't have the internet mad at you for wasting food.", "Nta y'all my girl sick as fuck. they ordered her food that she told her not too. her wasting food when she too sick to get up is excusable, chill with the moral bs. also before anyone yells that she spoiled she got a full ride. cool tf down", "NTA\n\n\"For example they would always ask if I wanted ice cream or pizza or something, I\u2019d say no, they\u2019d buy me food and then yell at me when I wouldn\u2019t eat it.\"\n\nI base my judgment on this.  If this was a one off, then yeah sure, fully in the other direction.  Sounds like words have failed you and you decided this was needed.\n\nWhether this was a smart move is a totally different topic, though, lmao.  I'd take the free shit personally, and they'll remember this when deciding to give you stuff in the future.  \n\n\nEdit:  I read your comments OP and you are definitely an A, just not for this haha.", "NTA.\n\ni get that the parents are concerned. but they need to understand when you mention if something is not possible for the moment. at this moment, rather than a concerned parent they become more of a hindrance. \n\nhope you start feeling better. also to your parents finally starting to understand your boundaries.", "Nta", "also everyone who calling her ta for foodwaste talk to her parents they caused it. she's far too sick to pick it up and yeah sometimes drastic things need to happen to get people to stop. ALSO SHE HAS FULL RIDE SHES BEEN PROVIDING FOR HERSELF FOR A WHILE. its called lovebombing look it up.", "NTA.\n\nYou're too sick to walk to the entrance and you already said NO to groceries.\n\nIf they cared enough they could have come by to check on you.\n\nGet well soon.", "also honest to god in this economy in a college town + doordash fees + tip + tax + restaurant tip, homegirl probably got some soup, pizza, chicken, and gatorase.

Now you're saying you don't. Get your story straight.", "You're in college, supposedly, why can't you seek mental health help for yourself?  Most colleges and universities have mental health centers.  What exactly do you expect them to do?", "So call your schools nurses like I suggested twice now because being that sick likely requires hospitalisation and observation.", "So am I", "After years of them forcing \u2018kind gestures\u2019 that I don\u2019t want on me and then weaponizing them against me whenever I tell them they\u2019re not supportive, it does feel good yes", "Good. Their \u2018help\u2019 consists of forcing things on me I want, and then weaponizing said things whenever I ask for mental health help or support. \u2018We already do x, y, and z for you and you\u2019re never satisfied\u2019", "That is literally the point, yes. \"This never happens again\" is the actual goal. If they \"never do this again\", that's a feature, not a bug. \n\nYou're looking at this through the lens of an overall healthy parent-child relationship with occasionally overbearing parents, but it seems to me that this is a consistent pattern of manipulation and verbal abuse, and you absolutely cannot apply the same standards of behavior to dealing with those two very different situations. \n\nPolitely saying no thank you to manipulative \"help\" you explicitly said you didn't want, doesn't stop people like that. The only way to get away from that behavior is to draw a hard line, be extremely blunt about it, and hold that line no matter what. That's what OP was trying to do.", "I hope so. I deserve something good after years of bearing my parents weaponizing \u2018nice gestures\u2019 to invalidate me when I say they aren\u2019t supporting me or my mental health", "Hurting the people that hurt you is", "What are you talking about? I never once said I don\u2019t need mental help", "Because I\u2019m a minor in a state where the age of medical consent is 18", "I did. What does that have to do with food?", "If that's what you're talking about then why are you saying the money's already been spent? That implies that you're talking about that as the thing being wasted.", "Like I said, ESH. Pretty bad, actually. You\u2019re surrounded by people who are struggling financially, yet all you care about is sticking it to your parents (who I imagine are paying a big part of your college tab, given the strong spoiled vibes here).", "Why did u come hear \u201cif it feels good\u201d then", "Out of curiosity, who is covering your expenses while you're in school? I ask bc if it's them, then they may feel you're not grateful for their help.", "I\u2019m fully with you. I don\u2019t want help like this, either. I\u2019d rather have no help at all than have to accept and act grateful for inconvenient and unwanted \u201chelp.\u201d", "Did OP mention that in the original post? No. They are being extremely argumentative with ANYONE who says YTA I\u2019m not particularly inclined to agreeing with them anymore. If it\u2019s rly that bad, (OP mentioned in another comment they \u201cwould be happy when [their] parents die) OP can get emancipated.", "Good lord. This sub is full of children. Parents buy groceries for their kid, get accused of abuse. Pathetic.", "Sounds like you already spend too much time reading about \u201cmental health\u201d. Misusing therapy-speak doesn\u2019t make you right.", "Good karma isn't coming to someone for doing a spoiled deed", "Dude yk how they are. But the food is already there at that point just send a mass txt saying where it will be delivered. Someone would\u2019ve ate it 100% and your parents would never had known", "Oh god \n\nChildren are the best form of birth control I\u2019ve ever encountered. Thanks for reminding me of that.", ">Yes. I haven\u2019t accepted anything they do attempt to give me, **because it\u2019s not actual mental help that I need**", "What state?", "What state? Our law in this one is 15, to make yoir own medical decisions", "It\u2019s got nothing to do with the food any more. If you are so sick you cannot even walk we should both be more concerned about how you need medical attention, not fretting about groceries.", "The money and the food are related here.", "Yes, when your parents have refused to actually help you for years and constantly invalidated you, you\u2019ll want to stick it to them. And no, I got a scholarship.", "After reading the OPs comments it feels like the college education OP is trying to get is also a waste.", "You mean here?", "Exactly. It\u2019s always self serving too, so they can feel better about themselves", "Well you sound like you\u2019d be as shitty a parent as mine so good", "Yes, as in the \u2018help\u2019 they give me is buying me food and clothes and such, not the *actual help I need*, which is mental help", "I mean OP is the asshole, but in this case he didn't say what you are reading into it  \n\n\nI haven't accepted anything because it's not what I need, which is the mental health help", "Indiana", "In that case, as I said I did call the nurse, so nothing to worry about"]}
