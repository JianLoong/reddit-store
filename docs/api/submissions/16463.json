As such I've accumulated a lot of art supplies over the past few years. My wife (Sally 27F) also dabbles a bit and we have converted one of the rooms in our home to an art studio of sorts. There's easily a few thousand dollars worth of art supplies in that room and we tend to keep it locked for that reason. Most important to me are my pencils and markers which were not cheap (Chartpak for those who care).\n\nOnto the story: Sally and I had her family over for her aunt's birthday a few weeks back and my BIL and SIL brought their kids with them (7F and 6M). We had forgotten to lock the door to the room that day. About an hour into the party I noticed that both kids were nowhere to be seen, so I asked my SIL if she knew where they were. She said that they were drawing in the other room. I asked if my wife was with them and she said she just told them which room it was in. I immediately rushed over to the art room and found it was a total mess. Most devastatingly was the fact that all my markers were ruined because that kids were using way to much force casing the tips to fray. I yelled at them to get out and they started crying. My BIL ran over and started yelling at me saying they're just kids and it's just markers. I told him that the markers alone were 17$ a piece and he said I was stupid for paying that much. Sally tried to diffuse the situation but my BIL starting yelling at her too saying we can't have this much art supplies and not expect kids wanting to use it. I told him he's paying to replace the markers and other supplies they ruined and he told me to go fuck myself and left. Everyone left shortly after that.\n\nI totaled up the damages and I needed to replace about 375$ and found that the kids drew on a piece I had spent the past week working on as well as ruining a finished piece Sally did. I sent him a bill and he blocked me. So I talked with my friend who was lawyer and had him draft a claim for small claims court and a letter to send my BIL (I paid him for this ofc). My wife is in agreement about this but her family has been mobbing us telling us we're being ridiculous over some markers. Only my FIL (who also has taken up painting recently) and my other SIL say that BIL has to pay.

Parents need to watch their own kids. How entitled is it to just send them to a room in someone else's house and tell them to go wild with whatever is there without even asking? I don't get all the YTA and ESH, saying you should have locked the door. How about the parents watch the children and make sure they stay with them? Though in this case that wouldn't have helped because they felt their kids were entitled to your stuff. The way they wrecked two pieces of actual art is the worst part of all.", "~~INFO - What is Sally's position on this since it is her family.  Was she supportive to going nuclear with a small claims?~~ \n\nNTA - Considering BIL didn't offer an apology or paying anything for the damages and just further insulting you, I don't see a problem going after him.  Parents are responsible for their kids actions IMO.  You know they wont pay anything otherwise.   I am not sure if the never ending drama this will cause for the rest of your lives is worth it though.", "I'll go with NTA, based on your SIL's  comment  \"She said that they were drawing in the other room. I asked if my wife was with them and she said she just told them which room it was in. \"\n\nSIL ought to have known that you don't give your kids permission to do something like that without asking.\n\nThe small claims thing is likely to burn all bridges with that part of the family, though.", "NTA. You don\u2019t open closed doors in other peoples houses without permission. Since you forgot to lock it it\u2019s safe to assume that the door was at least closed. The SIL should\u2019ve supervised her children at the very least to make sure they didn\u2019t make a huge mess with the art supplies. Unless they\u2019ve been allowed in the room before unsupervised there\u2019s no reason that they would\u2019ve been allowed in there by themselves rn. They should\u2019ve paid you back without oh having to take them to small claims because they were the ones who messed up by not watching their small children.", "Clearly NTA. I understand yelling at the kids, since you were startled yourself when you saw your aet supplies being destroyed, and it is a person's first reaction. It's also the fastest way to make a kid stop what they are doing.\n\nAs for the claims, go for it. Art supplies are expensive, and your BIL is responsible for his kids actions. If he doesn't want to compensate you voluntarily, use dispute resolution means", "NTA. How crazy irresponsible for SIL to let her kids just go into the room (let alone any of your rooms outside of the living room and such). Go to small claims court and get the money back, and never leave that room unlocked again.", "NTA\n\nIf it's just markers, then they shouldn't have a problem paying. It's just money.", "NTA\n\nI own expensive art supplies, and yet I can leave them lying around as my niece and nephews were taught not to touch things that don\u2019t belong to them.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to lock a door in your own home, your IL\u2019s should parent their children correctly.", "Nta.. i know how expensive that hobby is. My friend is into markers and stamps and it's not a cheap collection.  \n\nThis is the same as kids playing with your model planes thinking they are toys or lego sets that have been built.. they see them as toys and adults should know the value of an adult hobby/ art vs children's toys. \n\nPost an update after court!", "NTA. Parents have to clean up after their kids if they toss food around on a plane or restaurant, similarly, they have to clean up and replace what was damaged at someone's home as well. If the kids threw a baseball through a window their parents would have to pay, this is the same. If they were normal people they would have just venmo'd you the $300 and moved on. They wanna play hardball, so fine. Court is the recourse.", "NTA in the first place your sister should have never sent the kids to that room without permission from you or your wife. You should not have yelled at the kids because that\u2019s what their parent told them to do. The parents should definitely pay to replace your supplies.", "NTA.  He should definitely pay to replace the damaged supplies/work.  It doesn't matter if he thinks it's stupid to pay that much or not.  Art supplies are not cheap!  They should have been watching their kids!  It doesn't matter if the kids see art supplies and want to use them!  It's not their house and it's not their belongings.  I hope you're able to get them replaced!", "NTA. Everyone was over for a few hours for a dinner party. No adults got permission for their kids to play in a private place. No adults supervised. And this is not those kids home. They do not live there. \n\n Why on earth did the parents assume the kids were ok to play unsupervised with adult art supplies and adult artwork in a room with a closed door? Art supplies are expensive and a lot of adult art supplies are extremely toxic.\n\nFor those saying it's no big deal, imagine if the kids were in your bathroom playing with and destroying $400 of makeup. Just absolutely destroying a collection of MAC bullet lipsticks and dropped and destroyed your favorite designer perfume. Still no big deal?\n\nOk. Imagine if the kids went out back to play in the shed with your carpentry tools and destroyed a project with a handsaw and 5 totally different wood stains. Still ok? \n\nYour a gamer with a private gaming room with a  vintage GameCube collection and the kids left out, stepped on, and broke an old game disk valued at $375 while playing unsupervised and without permission in a private room no hosts expected people to be in. All good here? \n\nI do not understand those of you voting YTA. I expect guests (especially short term dinner party guests) who bring kids to my home to utilize my home respectfully, which includes not raiding my things without permission.", "NTA - \n\nSeems petty, but I'd die on this hill.", "NTA, it doesn't matter if the purchase was not a good value or unreasonable, they damaged goods and you are owed restitution. Small claims court is often pro se anyway so its not like the BIL would be out anything more than the cost of the markers. Your wife's family know that he would lose that though so thats why they are saying you are being ridiculous.", "If they're \"just markers\" and it's \"no big deal\" then he should pony up the cheddar with no problem. Why would he need to complain if markers are no big deal; he should just stfu and buy you some more. Easy peasy. \n\nNTA, do it.", "NTA.

People go for less.", "NTA.Quality supplies are expensive.", "NTA. I'm a parent and if my kids ruined anything that belonged to anyone else, I'd pay for it.

It's just the responsible thing to do. \nThen again, I'd never allow my kids to help themselves to someone else's belongings...", "NTA because bil wasn't watching the kids. They damaged art you each had been working on. That is unexcusable.  They need to compensate you for this by replacing destroyed art supplies. To me this is bigger than damaged markers.", "NTA. I would be devastated if somebody ruined my expensive art supplies. I have children over, and they know that my art supplies are off limits without permission. I then get materials for them which are more suitable for their age and less costly to me. \n\nPeople should spend money on their hobbies! Regardless if it's art, sports, gaming etc - damaging somebody's property is never okay.\n\nYour BIL is the AH for judging you about spending money on something he doesn't think is important, and therefore justifying his children destroying said items.", "Bruh, KIDS' art supplies are expensive, let alone ADULT art supplies. Regardless of if it was art supplies, furniture, or anything else, if they ruined it, they should pay for it. Pretty simple NTA", "My daughter is a budding artist.

Parents who can't control their kids are one of my pet peeves.  I'd do the small claims court thing and then totally, completely, absolutely cut the BIL at least, out of your social life.  Who needs family like this?  I have two little girls and would be floored if they did something like this and would pay up in a heartbeat...  NTAH times ten...", "NTA. BIL and SIL ought to be watching their kids, and decent parents should be teaching their kids to respect other people's stuff and ask before playing with things. They  told the kids to just go into your studio and do whatever without asking you if that was okay with you. That is their responsibility. I'm sure if they had asked you, you would have said no. Now the kids have ruined expensive equipment and your in laws are refusing to take responsibility for.\n\nThe issue here is basically that your in-laws think that art supplies are fundamentally \"for kids\" and cannot fathom the idea of adults doing art as a serious hobby and having high-end art supplies for that. To them, your studio might as well have been a playroom and markers are built to be smashed into paper and chewed on and snapped in half, oh well! They can't imagine any reason why that stuff would cost more than a 64pack of crayola crayons at target. They do not respect your things even after you explained the value and refuse to take responsibility for it. Some people in this thread are saying that taking them to small claims court isn't worth a few hundred bucks and you should just suck it up, but what your in laws have revealed to you is that they won't take responsibility and won't listen to you, and they don't respect your belongings and passions. For me, those are things that would make me pull back from having a significant relationship anyways. If you suck it up and let it slide, they will probably still think you were a jerk and will not respect the things you value in the future. \n\nYou are fully within your rights to take them to small claims court.", "NTA. That\u2019s something a 2 yr old does not older kids like that. But the real problem here is SIL let them do it. She knew which room it was and didn\u2019t even ask. That alone makes you NTA. They needs to pay.", "NTA. It's a complete disrespect of your property and of the pieces you'd both created. If they wanted their kids to have an activity to entertain them, they should have brought over their own supplies or toys for the kids.\n\nPeople sometimes wonder why people like you and I keep rooms in our homes locked. This is why! Because you can't even trust your own family to respect your home and property.", "NTA\n\nNo one expects the children to not want to use the art room. However it is reasonable to expect parents to watch their own kids in someone else\u2019s home. Not only did they not do that, your SIL actually sent them in there.\n\nYour BIL is being a jerk, and as long as you have your wife\u2019s support I think you\u2019re being totally fair.", "NTA, if they're \"just markers\" they should have no issue replacing them. So tired of people disrespecting artists as if we haven't been important throughout history. Oh yeah it's just kid stuff until the artist becomes famous \ud83d\ude44", "Absolutely NTA. Only assholes let kids use stuff they haven't explicitly been given permission to use -- let alone to do so unattended.  And at 6 and 7.  Kids that age have no regard for anything -- clearly proven by the ruining of 2 pieces of other people's artwork.  BIL can go fuck himself, after he cuts you a bank draft.", "If it had been another hobby supplies ruined, would he have felt the same way? Golf clubs bent, rotary blades snapped off a \u00a31000 helicopter, cake decorating tools ruined.\nThe point isn't the equipment. He obviously thinks 'art' is kids stuff, its the blatant disrespect he and his wife showed, not to mention slack parenting.\nWould the kids have known what was behind the closed door if SIL hadn't pointed them in that direction.", "NTA. If the rest of the family thinks it\u2019s no big deal, they can send you the money.", "Omfg! As an artist,  this made me feel sick!!!!! I could tell where it was going! People really don't understand how much these things cost!!!!!!! NTA ugh people have no idea of boundaries and let their kids do whatever without consequences!!!! If that was an expensive car or something,  it'd be different,  but because its markers.... \ud83d\ude14", "NTA I had a good long talk with my kids about how much my Copics cost and they never went near them. Those markers are an investment and you deserve to be compensated for their loss but where are you paying $17 a piece because you are getting robbed.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nYou break it, you buy it. Looking past someone breaking something and not asking recompense is an option, sure, but not a given. And while family is more likely to get a pass, no one's really entitled to it.\n\nBut do consider you'll be burning a bridge to part of the family by doing this. If that's fine with you, that's your choice", "NTA\n\nFirst off the kids should never have been allowed in there without supervision, locked or not locked. Second, once it was clear how much damage they did, the BIL should have apologized profusely and offered to pay for the damages without even being asked.", "NTA.\n\nI would get the BIL's side if it was Crayola or cheap brands, but as a fine artist myself, I understand how fucking expensive these supplies are. They didn't handle them correctly and ruined the utensils. Also, the fact is they drew on your art piece and your S/O's finished work that you both poured hours of time into. \n\nAs someone who poured over 72 hours into just one comic panel - I would be absolutely gutted to find my artwork ruined and the supplies I invested in as well.", "It doesn\u2019t matter what the family says, only what the judge says.  This wasn\u2019t them losing track of the kids \u2014 they sent them in!  NTA", "NTA! As an artist myself with kids I have a very clear boundary with them about which supplies they are allowed or not allowed to use. Not all markers or art supplies are created equal. Explain to your in laws (or have your spouse do it) that professional products are much more expensive and are not intended to be used by kids (unless they are particularly artistically inclined and experienced I guess). Some of them can also be toxic, so there is a safety concern there.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you sell art or do it professionally or just make an income from your hobby, but consider bringing up the fact that professional tools are an investment in a particular profession and them destroying those tools is akin to destroying a professional violinist\u2019s violin or a limo driver\u2019s car.\n\nI also recommend getting a big pile of kid friendly supplies that you can keep around the house for future visits- this way they have materials and you can start educating the kids about art and materials in a friendly way and they\u2019ll have their own things to destroy instead of your good stuff. Hopefully that will also alleviate some of the bad feelings in the long run! But I also hope that your in laws realize that they are responsible for damaging your property regardless of what the property was.", "I have a 7 and 6 year old and could see them doing this. If I realized they had actually broken expensive art supplies beyond repair I\u2019d apologize and repay the money without question. NTA.", "NTA. Everyone on here saying \"you should have locked the door \ud83d\ude2b \" is the same victim blaming bs that's always used.

My niece (who is 2) already knows what \"not yours\" or \"not an option\" are. This is on the parents for not caring.\n\nTake them to court if they want to block and ignore the situation.

Literally letting the kids into your studio to destroy things, they're kids, he knew what was going to happen)", "NTA- No child should ever be touching anything that does not belong to them without express permission.

Value was maybe $50 back in 1991.\n\nNeither of us had $50 so my parents paid for them and chose the way we worked it off.

Of course, if you are a professional you are going to have professional grade tools.  And those arent cheap! \n\nI don't know about court cases and whatnot, but that is all up to you.

Hell, my kids aren\u2019t allowed on the kitchen chairs because they may scratch them. Your BIL is an ass for not paying attention to his kids and think they can go wherever without asking. His refusal to pay for the damages was a dick move, so you are NTA", "I wonder what BIL reaction would have been if the kids had gotten into some toxic glue, epoxy, or other chemicals and hurt themselves?

If sister and BIL's kids came into your home and destroyed, say, your TV or scraped your car with rocks, for damn sure you'd expect your sister and BIL to pay up. They're not \"just markers\" (your family is apparently a bunch of Philistines!), and anyway, if kids damage things in your house, of course the kids' parents should replace what was damaged. Merely because other people think you're playing with markers doesn't mean you haven't put a lot of money, love and time into purchasing and using your art supplies. I bet you'll never forget to lock the door again, though.", "NTA.\n\nThis is a good situation to have a third party adjudicator or judge to find the best way to remediate the issue. You reached out to negotiate outside of court and he said \u201cNo, I do not want to negotiate.\u201d That\u2019s the end of the story from my perspective. If you aren\u2019t willing to talk it out and come to an agreement, then you should give your case to the judge and let them decide. It\u2019s the exact reason we have small claims court.", "NTA - art supplies are EXPENSIVE!!  BIL NEEDED to offer to replace them.

I\u2019m honestly surprised that it wasn\u2019t more than the actual amount you said.

I hope you can get things settled somehow.", "Correct me if I'm reading this wrong, but did your wife let the kids into the room and leave them unsupervised? That is what it sounds like - and if she did, she's the one you should be upset with. We have young nieces who like to draw whenever they come over and we don't let them use the good art supplies for this reason - if your wife let them in the room and walked away I can see where the parents assumed that the stuff was ok for kids to use. Most people don't know the difference between professional quality markers and crayolas. It sounds like BIL is being overly defensive, but that's a response to anger that was directed at the kids who didn't know any better and the adults who thought they had permission rather than at the person who should have stopped them - your wife.\n\nIf i read this wrong and the kids wandered in on their own you have a right to be upset and t seek damages, but getting angry and yelling at people very rarely leads to a solution.

Yes he could\u2019ve been a bit more patient and not yell at the kids, but how would you feel seeing not only your materials but your art tarnished. Any self respecting artist prizes their pieces to illicit some reaction when their EXPENSIVE materials and pieces are ruined. Everything he and his wife did are justified and should not feel like they\u2019re in the wrong. If anything if he didn\u2019t have this reaction this wouldn\u2019t have been a teachable lesson for those kids. I swear you kids raised nowadays will get offended for some subtext and ignore the main issue. Victim blaming is wild. Good luck OP, hope you can put an artistic spin on those pieces ruined, make it be modern art haha", "Not an asshole.  I would proceed.  He hasn't even offered an apology.\n\nJust because you have kids, doesn't give you the right to let the little shits destroy other people's property.

If for whatever reason I became negligent and my kids went into someone\u2019s art room and destroyed their stuff, I would replace absolutely everything I could and offer to purchase the finished pieces they ruined.

My nephew put his head through the wall of my brand new home while rough housing the day BEFORE we moved in and his parents pretended like it never even happened.

I'm assuming the door isn't kept locked when it's just you in the house? You forgot to shut it this ONE time when guests were about, how dare you. I think a lot if it coming from this angle is having the \"wonderful\" power of hindsight.\n\nWhen I was a kid, I used to go to my cousin's house a lot and I was told to \"go play\" in attic upstairs (where all the toys were kept) but I knew there were still some \"special\" toys of my cousin's that were not a free for all that I'd have to ask about, rather than just rummage through everything. If I was told to \"go play\" in my cousin's bedrooms or a friend's room, again, I certainly wouldn't have touched ANYTHING without prior permission; maybe it helped that as a kid, and even now, I'm very precious about my own space, so I understood the unwritten rule \"look but don't touch\" with people's possessions.", "NTA, what people spend their money on should not matter, it still costs money.   \nThat said, if you want to keep the peace, you could just look at it as an expensive learning lesson.

My understanding is 6 and 7 year olds are not known for their reasoning abilities. They made a mistake in using your expensive supplies. I'm hesitant to call it a mistake because, oh wait... THEY WERE TOLD IT WAS OKAY!!! \n\nWhat really blows my mind is BIL and SIL know you have a room that you specifically keep locked because it contains expensive things. SIL then pointed out that room as a place for her kids to go play in??? If this room had expensive audio equipment, or some other high-dollar hobby materials inside, I don't think this would have been an issue. \n\nAlso if those pieces had been commissioned, you would have had to explain to a client why their items were not salvageable, and either offer a refund or restart the work.

When I came home I saw him rush past me and out the door with my comfort plushies, down the stone stair steps at full speed and into the dog yard in the rain. He dropped all of the plushies in some dirt and dog poo and ran straight for our dog. I yelled for mom to watch the fucking kid cus Jesus Christ and to never ever let any more strangers kids into my room.\n\nAnd it was always my fault. The kid who erased my games also pulled the plug out of our freezer for some reason and I got the blame for that too even though I wouldn't be able to reach it.

They really didn't do anything wrong. \n\nI have a feeling the kids have been in there and played before, potentially supervised.

Absolutely. And if they don\u2019t and cause damage they should be held responsible for that. The flip side though is that if you want to reduce the chance that someone who doesn\u2019t respect what belongs to other people, you should probably take precautions to keep them from doing that. Should you have to? Certainly not, but just because other people should behave respectfully and responsibly doesn\u2019t mean the will and even if you can get them to make it right it\u2019s much easier if that situation didn\u2019t arise in the first place. That being said, it\u2019s never your fault if someone doesn\u2019t act how they should and causes damage regardless of how many precautions you did or didn\u2019t take; the fault is still on them and you shouldn\u2019t be blamed or shamed for it.
