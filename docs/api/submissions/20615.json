Is the size of the bed really that big of a deal to you? Sounds like your parents were trying to compromise letting you keep your room. At the end of the day, these are your grandparents.", "Soft YTA, you agreed to this when the bed was purchased for you. Have some empathy and put yourself if their shoes, what if the roles were reversed. How would you feel?", "YTA, your grandparents are making a trip to spend with you on your birthday, and you are unwilling to do what you said you would previously so they could be more comfortable.", "YTA there was a deal made, you don\u2019t get to renegotiate the terms now. Your parents gave good compromises which they didn\u2019t have to do", "YTA only because you made the agreement beforehand.  I wouldn't have done that....lol....I have a phobia about other people sleeping in my bed.", "Soft YTA. Its nice your grandparents are coming for a visit to celebrate your birthday and it sounds like taking your king bed is what\u2019s needed for them to do so :-)", "NTA there is an empty room with an empty bed, seems pretty darn obvious and logical that the guest use that room and bed and you keep sleeping in Your bed in Your room.", "Happy birthday OP!!! \n\nIn this case, despite it being your birthday I would say YWBTA. You made an agreement with your parents and as much as it may suck in the moment, the proper thing to do is honor that agreement. Not just for them, but for you too. It may sound silly and old fashioned, but you\u2019ll respect yourself more in the end by sticking by your word.", "YTA, you agreed to give them your bed, just give them your bed and sleep in your sisters room.", "Don\u2019t be a turd - just be respectful and decent and give your grandma or grandparents your room and bed.", "YTA you made a deal.", "Yeah, YTA.  \nYour parents tried to compromise by allowing you to keep your room if not your bed.  \nYou should appreciate the importance of your grandma sleeping in a comfortable bed, and it sounds like your bed is the most comfortable.  \nAt 17 I could sleep on the floor and be OK the next day. At almost 40, an uncomfortable bed can cause pain or at least serious discomfort the next day. At older ages? If my grandmother sleeps uncomfortably, it can have repercussions for days ahead.\n\n\\*Curious if also part of the issue is you were hoping to have someone else in said bed?
