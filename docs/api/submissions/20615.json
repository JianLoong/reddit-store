Children are human beings and deserve to have the security of their things being THEIR things.", "Teenagers should be able to have their own space to themselves, especially someone at the age of 17. The \u201cthey don\u2019t make the rules\u201d mindset for children of that age is a bit outdated and has shown to be harmful in many cases, as well as children not growing up with a sense of privacy and security, which a room provides. I get that they don\u2019t actually make the rules but at 17 it still shouldn\u2019t be a tyranny over the child, talking and coming to a solution together should be the first step, and find out what the issue is with the compromise you brought up. If they fail to comply with everything then yes, ultimately parents do have the final say, but it\u2019s ridiculous to completely rule out another human beings opinion just because of their age.", "\u201cchildren\u201d OP is seventeen years old. that\u2019s not a child, that\u2019s almost a grown-ass (legal) adult.", "so you're saying children have no right to consent and boundaries? wtf is wrong with you", "u/JurassicParkFood: \"Children aren't people.

That is kind of fucked up", "That's a very different situation and is in no way comparable to OPs.", "Excellent point. Edit: Not certain OP has stated if they\u2019re a boy though.", "Maybe she has a smaller bed.  Like a full or a twin, which she likes the size or her room is too small for a bigger one", "This but unironically", "He also mentioned grandpa sleeps upstairs", "Most parents do not buy a king sized bed for a child. Even a teenager. It was a good compromise; they bought a bed that would suit the grandparents but didn\u2019t turn one of the larger bedrooms into the \u201cguest room\u201d. Problem is that OP doesn\u2019t understand the nature of the compromise.", "Most people don't have unlimited resources for extra bedrooms & mattresses. Have you ever purchased a bed or mattress? They're expensive, hence why many families make agreements such as these. They let OP use this mattress year round, and they bought a nice one so their elderly parents could visit in comfort. Just because you have a life of extra bedrooms doesn't mean others have access to that.", "Money is a contraint to most.", "It's the parent's bed.", "It's a bed bought for the kid with the understanding that grandma gets to use it while she's there.", "It's frankly kinda sad how many people here are acting because OP is 17, they get no agency over their life, or how something they agreed on when they were 14, needs to remain true at 17... As if there is no difference in privacy needs between a 14 year old and 17 year old. \"Their house, their rules\" is just invented by power-tripping parents that can't nurture the individuality of their own children, even if it's *obviously* true: There's just no need to use that kind of language to the children you chose to have. \n\nIf there's a medical need for grandma to use the nice fluffy bed, then the parents failed to communicate that to OP, because OP seems capable enough to understand why their grandparents are not sleeping together (the snoring). People here are blaming OP for \"screaming\" (though their post didn't say they screamed, it said they *complained*), but parents here are using a cheap cop-out by saying \"you agreed, get over yourself\", rather than sitting OP down and explaining the need for it (if there is any) or hearing them out why it's so important to them to keep their own bed and take that into consideration.\n\nI'm calling OP NTA, and I'd personally feel terrible for kicking someone out of their bed, no matter how old I am, and how young they are.", "OP does have their own space - the parents are fine with them keeping the room.  But they bought the big, nice bed to serve as an occasional grandparent bed and OP agreed to that.  The parents are willing to take that big bed and move it to the sister's room (that's the compromise), and OP doesn't want that.  OP doesn't want to compromise... They want both their room and the nice bed, despite agreeing to share so that they could get that nice bed in the first place.", "I'm not saying he doesn't get to ask to keep his room. I'm saying, that he doesn't get to demand it. Grandma is coming for a short stay, they've already discussed and agreed on the best bed for occasional shifting, and now it's time to shift.

Grandma doesn't need that room for any reason except the parents exerting dominance over their child.", "I don't think it's okay to change an agreement unitary when you come to the give position.  \n\n\nI think he's YTA for assuming things would change without ever bringing the topic up beforehand.", "I\u2019m aware, I was moreso addressing the other comment, not really OPs post", "Oooh i See, i misunderstood your comment, mb for the confusion. I 100% agree with that statement", "That's a harmful mindset to have, yikes", "You literally have to admit that you\u2019re not exactly an unbiased source here.\n\nI had a happy, healthy upbringing and occasionally lost access to my room for as much as a week to make room for family. My situation is closer to OP\u2019s and I feel comfortable saying he wont care about this or view it as some horrible injustice in a few year\u2019s time.\n\nSimilarly I got the downstairs bedroom, a better living situation, and in exchange when my grandparents came thats where they stayed. Stairs were hard on their knees. It isnt just about vacant or not, and when I have kids and my parents are visiting I\u2019ll want them to be as comfortable as possible \n\nOP can grandstand about the injustice of it all but, unless he is actually in an extreme situation like yours, when hes older like me he wont care. I wish I could have done more to make my grandparents comfortable, they were great people and loved me a lot", "No worries, mate. Have a good one", "It's really not. Modern, western kids have it better than almost all people in all of human history, but I got people calling me a tyrant for expecting the kid to share his room with grandma, as agreed to, for a night or two. It's a mild inconvenience. That's it.", "I actually think it is... \n\nPerhaps its because I can't simply can't relate & was always raised around having myself heard whenever something (no matter how big or small) made me uncomfortable. I was never forced to do something simply because \u201cim the parent - you're the child\u201d dynamics. \n\nbut uhm, to each their own I suppose", "It's great to discuss things with your kids. I do the same with my kids. But my kids don't have final say because it's my job to lead and their job to learn to lead.
