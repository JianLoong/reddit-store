My bed is my bed and it\u2019s where I\u2019m comfortable, sleeping in someone else\u2019s bed/someone sleeping on my bed is way different.

But growing up, my parents asked me how I felt about something before they went through with it (around 14) mostly where I was the legitimate focus. For example, I've also had this sort of situation of giving up my room, which I didn't mind at all when I was younger. It became an issue for me when I would be on my period, and preferred the comfort of my own room, my own things, having what I needed in the same room that I was in because its what I needed at the time. I know its not exactlyyyyy the same situation, but I understand the frustration of just wanting the comfort of your own bedroom. \n\nHowever, with regards to your last point about the deal. I fully agree that she should hold up her end of the deal, which according to OP, was only settled because there wasn't any other available bedroom aside from the guest one which grandpa uses alone to get away from the snoring -- very valid. But now the situation has changed, where there IS more than one available bedroom, so why should OP give her bedroom up when there's now an available bedroom? If the parents bought the king sized bed specifically FOR grandparents to use, then she's essentially in the wrong room. But if OP gave her bedroom up because of lack of space -- that's no longer an issue , and the specifics of the deal , have changed."]}
