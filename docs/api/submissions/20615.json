At the end of the day, these are your grandparents.", "Soft YTA, you agreed to this when the bed was purchased for you.

You made an agreement with your parents and as much as it may suck in the moment, the proper thing to do is honor that agreement. Not just for them, but for you too.

At almost 40, an uncomfortable bed can cause pain or at least serious discomfort the next day. At older ages? If my grandmother sleeps uncomfortably, it can have repercussions for days ahead.\n\n\\*Curious if also part of the issue is you were hoping to have someone else in said bed?

You seem to have misunderstood your parents\u2019 purchase of the king-size bed in which you usually sleep. It\u2019s much bigger than a single person needs, and a lot more expensive than something that would have met your actual sleep needs. Only very spoiled kids are bought king-sized beds by their parents. Your parents bought that bed so that your grandparents could sleep in it when they visit, according to what sort of bed would suit their needs. It\u2019s been in your room because it\u2019s not reasonable to leave a large bed in a large room unused most of the time.

If not YTA, that was part of the deal for the bed. If you bought the bed than NTA.", "Wait\u2026 you was only allowed an actual bed so your grandparents can use it?? LOL", "YTA.

And it\u2019s your birthday, there appears to be no negative relationship with the G-Rents - I\u2019d give up my room.

Even if you aren't all using it at the same time. Just yuck and ewwww.", "YTA - sounds like your parents treated you to this luxurious bed under the condition it was to shared with guests, which you agreed to.
