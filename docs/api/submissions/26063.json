It reached what I thought was it's lowest possible point about a year and a half ago, when my Mother slept with one of the patrons at the Bar she worked at. Things were very tense, and awkward for a while, but eventually her and my Stepfather reconciled, and we ended up moving into a new house about a year later.\n\nUnfortunately, it came to my attention about a month ago that my Mother was sexting with a different separate bar patron. When I learned about it from my Stepfather, I had no concrete evidence about it, so I asked her point blank if it was true. She proceeded to lie to me, stating that I had no right to ask her those kinds of questions, and began yelling about how I don't pay rent(even though she never asked me to), and when i pointed that out, she stated that i was supposed to do work around the house, as it wasn't in the best shape when we bought it. I responded by pointing out that she doesn't give me anything to do, there's no list that says what needs to be done that week, and I'm just left to figure it out.\n\nAfter that, I called my Stepfather's bluff, and told him to send me the screenshots he had. He then did so.They were heartbreaking, and infuriating. I confronted her about it the next day. She apologized for lying to me, but not for belittling and insulting me the day before. She justified her actions by saying, quote: \"I'm tired of waiting for your Stepfather to put me first\". I haven't forgiven her, and we'll probably argue about it when I get home from vacation.

I would suggest you take care. Only trust what you clearly know is true", "Info:how old are you?", "NTA Your mom sounds like a real piece of work.  Isn't it interesting that she blames her husband for her cheating but if he had been the one cheating it would be all his fault?  If you are old enough, you should move out ASAP.", "NTA - she was basically cheating. she cant be trusted, what is there to forgive?", "Why are you parents not together? Is this a pattern of hers? If so she should stop destroying your family. \n\nThat\u2019s why you always need to find out while dating if the person cheated. \n\nAlso ask what the most common fights between them and previous partner was. \n\nWhat was the thing their partner nagged them about. \n\nThat\u2019s how you find out what a person\u2019s character really is. \n\nI don\u2019t think people know how to date with intention. \n\nSorry for the pain in your family.

Women get hit on at bars A LOT.... and she has been unable to avoid the advances of either customers or co-workers.  She needs to Absolutely Leave her current employer and work somewhere other than at a bar where she is tempted by others.  For the same reason a guy on a diet should not go to an all-you-can-eat buffet, working at a bar is not the ideal environment for her.  Please feel free to share my thoughts with your stepfather.

This is between your mom and your stepdad.
