He told me his wife got a new job with a great pay and she now makes double what he does. Isaac is very proud of her, but he feels like he is falling behind her and not contributing enough.

I gave him a little speach about how it's not worth it to be loyal to a company. The company doesn't give a shit about him and he should go and find a better paying job out there. It would do good to both his confidence and his marriage. His wife most likely married him because she saw the potential in him, so he now needs to put in the effort and live up to it.\n\nToday, I got a bunch of angry messages from Isaac's wife, calling me an asshole. She accused me of being an awful friend and destroying Isaac's confidence.\n\nQuite frankly, I think that's bullshit, Isaac's confidence was already destroyed and I just gave him tips how to build it up. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I want to address the sexism accusations.\n\nI do not believe that women in general just go and leave their husbands when they find a higher earning man. However, I've known Isaac's wife for years now.\n\nShe is a very confident and determined woman, who always achieves what she wants. She makes detailed step-by-step plans for everything and despite being 4 years younger than Isaac, she had already surpassed him in a lot of things. I think it's very easy to feel lacking when you are standing next to her.\n\nIsaac was her first boyfriend ever, she never even kissed anybody else. I think he kind of convinced himself that she only picked him due to her lack of experience with men and as soon as she gets to know someone else a little better, she will realize \"she can do better\".\n\nI'm not saying that will happen, but I can see where Isaac is coming from and I think the solution is to fix up Isaac confidence.", "created_utc": 1674814787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mhkmq/aita_for_telling_my_friend_he_should_find_a/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I gave him a little speach about how it's not worth it to be loyal to a company. The company doesn't give a shit about him and he should go and find a better paying job out there\n\nThis is good advice, and would be very encouraging to hear from a friend - Isaacs skills are valuable, and he should find a job where they are valued as much as he deserves.\n\n>His wife most likely married him because she saw the potential in him, so he now needs to put in the effort and live up to it.\n\nThis is the part that makes you TA. This is where you're equating greater financial success with his wife not leaving him. You're basically insulting them both here - saying that she only loves him as far as his paycheck and would leave him for a guy who makes more money? That's kinda messed up. Your idea of success is not everyone's.", "YTA - why would you assume the reason another person chooses to marry someone?  Newsflash, women aren't out here marrying men just for what they can or cannot provide. We easily know how to fend for ourselves. If your friend feels the need to find a higher paying position because it'd help his own self confidence, then that's fine. However, you don't need to be filling his head with nonsense about how his wife is going to leave him for a better and \"more successful\" man. \n\nThe ignorance here is unfathomable.", "YTA - you didn\u2019t just destroy his confidence by confirming his fear that he is not good enough as he is, you also hinted that his wife is shallow and only wants him for his earning potential.", "Yes, YTA, I also earn much more than my husband. Your speech about the company he works for is not good ect. is fine, but the bit about his wife is really not okay. We no longer live in 1950 in a time when women could not / were not allowed to take care of themselves financially.", "YTA to assume his wife married him because she 'saw the potential in him'.\nHe's not a project and you give her so little credit. \nI understand he might be insecure but that is on him. \nWhy do some men who earn less than their partners are so threatened?\nWe don't live in caves anymore. People can provide for themselves and marry someone they love and want to build a life with.", "YTA\n\nYou insulted him and his wife. You said he was a failure because he doesn't make enough and she was a shallow money grubber who only valued his salary.   \n\n\n *His wife most likely married him because she saw the potential in him,*  Seriously? How about she married him because she liked his cooking or his sex appeal or his great jokes or his all round aweseomeness.   \n\n\nThat's a hideous way to think of a friend.   \n\n\nGranted he should go job hunting because everyone underpaid should, but that is 100% seperate from how his wife feels about him.  But if he likes the work (which wasn't even mentioned?) then her salary means he can stay in a job he enjoys.", "YTA and Issac a little bit too.\n\nYou basically implied that Issac's wife will leave him because he makes less money than his wife. You destroyed his confidence even further and you amplified his fear. Of course if he is grossly underpaid at where he currently works then yeah, great advice to get a better job and aim higher. However, this seems like advice to reach his wife's expectations (expectations I doubt exist)\n\nIssac is a little bit of TA, not for being afraid he isn\u2019t doing enough (even though I personally doubt that) but for also implying that his wife will leave him because he makes less than her. Issac should really consider the fact that maybe she doesn\u2019t care about whether he makes less than her or not and in fact married him for him and not the amount of money he makes", "YTA. And frankly it is laughable that you don't see it. And that you're calling BS on the effect your horrible words had. YTA.", "YTA. Isaac\u2019s wife is right - she saw the effects of what you said to him. You sound really insensitive.", "YTA. You've admitted he's happy where he is, and implied his wife only stays with him because he expects him to earn lots of money. Have you even considered the fact that maybe his wife married him because she loves him? Rather than him being a good money maker?", "You are absolutely an A... and sadly not his friend. Your friends wife is totally right, you should not have said those things. A man is only lovable with a higher paying job or a higher paycheck than his partner? Are you in your 80ies? What a sad and kind of misogynistic standpoint you have concerning love and marriage...", "YTA \n\nYou didn't give Isaac 'tips', you gave him a lecture and made presumptions about the nature of his relationship. His wife most likely married him because she loved him, but you seem to have assumed she has a problem with Isaac earning less than her and will leave him if he doesn't get a better paying job. That's Isaac's worry, and it may not be rooted in reality. His wife might be perfectly happy with his earnings, and there's more to their marriage than money.\n\nFor all you know, Isaac just wanted a listening ear, someone to confide in, but you decided to judge him and the state of his relationship and take it upon yourself to 'fix' him when he didn't ask you to. Did he ask for your advice? Did he ask for a lecture? Or did you decide the way to boost his 'destroyed' confidence was to confirm his fear, essentially call him a failure, and suggest that his wife only wanted him for the money he could bring in?", "YTA, she did not choose him for the potential and you just put into his head that she only loves him for money and expected money, not for him as a being. That she would turn away from him, the second she got a man with more money instead of just telling him: Well if you feel like you do not contribute enough, you can either look for a better paying job or take over more household chores, that is work too, you know. But she loves you for who you are, not for money.\n\nBut no, you decided to tell the man with low confidence, that all his fears are real and his wife does not love him for who he his, but just for the potential money.", "YTA for suggesting wife married him for.\"his potential.\"  However, NTA for suggesting he get a better paying job.", "YTA. Not your lane.", "YTA.  This is such a common theme anymore.  I really think a great piece of advice would have been to seek out therapy.  As female, and an extremely successful one at that,  I see this  all the damn time in the workforce.  I have always made more than the husband and absolutely think he's the greatest thing that ever lived. I can give a rats ass how much he makes and im not sure why men are so intimidated by a high earning female. (To clarify, not the hubby but have seen men he works with be bent out of shape if there is mention the female makes more). If in the relationship there is no history of cheating why would a group of successful men be able to create that conflict?  A person is who they are on the inside.. their morals, values and character are established, especially by their 30s.  I am personally saddened to see how many men think my husband is not the \"man of the house\"..purely based on financial s.   Maybe you should have said, hmm, has your wife cheated previously..no? Oh well is your wife happy with your current job...yes? Are you happy at your current job...yes?  Followed with, Seek therapy my friend, sounds like you have a great wife who cares about you and some deep insecurities that need spoke to a professional about.   \nSorry for the rant,  I get fired up over andrew tate mentality \ud83d\ude05  I'm living proof you can be successful and remain honorable with your partner.", "YTA to his wife. This sounds like something Lucille Bluth would say. It's backhanded. \"Trying to help\" on the surface but undermining someone's marriage along the way.\n\nYou reinforced misogynistic and paranoid ideas about her commitment to him and her values. You basically didn't give her the benefit of the doubt that she actually loves him. \n\nThis is probably the same sexist paranoia that Isaac was trying to fight off. You could have been a good friend and supported their marriage by saying that he should get a better job so he feels good about himself, not so that his wife didn't leave him. Man I'd be pissed if someone said that about me. \n\nHe brought up his own insecurity, why did you have to wrap her into it too? Not everyone in the world is that insecure dude. \n\nHusband needs better friends, obviously. You should apologize for projecting your own insecurity into their relationship.", "You did the right thing, for the wrong reasons. \n\nHe is in a terrible job, where he is being taken advantage of, and you have pointed out the realities of life. Projecting this on his marriage, and what his wife potentially sees in him is inappropriate. You should have stopped while you were ahead. You do not know what his wife is dealing with, and how she is handling the situation.", "YTA\n\nYou should've encouraged him to look for a job that matches his level of education and expertise, but you should've left his wife out of it. You have no idea why she married him, and you should've tried to talk him out of thinking his wife will leave him, not encouraged this thought process.", "YTA. You did not base your advice on the state of the relationship, but rather played into his insecurities. You should have assured him that whatever changed, his wife's commitment to the relationship was not included in that change.\n\nAdvice about his career should have been completely separate from advice about his relationship.", "YTA.\n\nyes if he underpaid def get him to look for something that will respect him but if they are happy there and have no issues why bring it up. just seems like you wanted to put some silly man make more than woman nonsense on him. you played into his fears not up lifting him", "Hm soft YTA for me\u2026 cause I believe your intentions were good, but the way you phrased your concerns and advice were too harsh.. you could\u2019ve given advice that would get on the same point without it sounding so terrible..and definitely not voicing that his wife could leave him, but still encouraging him to find a better job\u2026", "ESH?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t leave a man for someone cause they were paid better and it seems a bit misogynistic you both think that way", "Woah YTA! Youve basically fuelled his insecurities by saying his wife is that shallow that she would leave him for someone with more money! You havent built up his ego at all, youve smashed it even more by saying he isnt living up to the \"potential\" his wife saw in him (in your eyes). God who needs enemies when \"friends\" like you are around!", "YTA. You clearly think a person's salary is the only thing that could make them a good husband. Isaac's wife apparently disagrees, and loves him for reasons other than his money - imagine that! Meanwhile, Isaac has asshole friends like you who tell him she's a materialistic person who will leave him for a colleague because his salary is too low.\n\nShe probably spends tons of time trying to get the stupid idea that his salary matters out of his head while you're out there trying to convince him he's worthless. You are a terrible friend and if I was his wife I'd be exteremly annoyed that he hangs out with you.\n\nYou're right about switching companies etc., but that's not the point. The mere fact that you use 'better' and 'better-paid' as synonyms for people says it all really.", "I'm stuck on Either N A H or E S H if I'm honest. I can understand that he doesn't want to feel like he is having to rely more on his wife and that he wants to be able to contribute, but to conflate that with 'she's going to leave me for a guy with more money' just shows that he is insecure and blaming those insecurities on his wife.\n\nAnd then theres you. Your speech started well, because you're right, the company doesn't give a shit about the individual. But the part where you said she 'married him because she saw potential in him?' Are you sure she didn't just marry him because she **loves him**?\n\nI'm going to go with ESH, except for Isaac's poor wife. She's out there doing what she loves and making bank and all she gets in return is shown how her marriage can only be transactional in his and his best friends eyes.", "NTA, but purely because it wasn't malicious and I think you're just a bit dense.\n\nI agree that he *should* get a better paying job (if he's grossly underpaid), but by focusing on that, and that alone, you kinda made his wife sound like a gold digger.", "YTA and so is Isaac for reinforcing this old stereotype and making her sound like she is only with him for money.\n\nSeriously, have you ever met a high-earning woman that left her husband after a receiving a raise because he makes less? I haven\u2019t. Yes I know there are women that look for a men with a lot of money but they are usually not the ones with high-paying careers. \n\nAnd if you say yes, person X was left because his wife outearned him, do you know her perspective? Because I know a guy that goes around and claims that. Her side sounds different: she worked more hours, hence earned more. Despite her longer hours he refused to even do 30% of chores because apparently that was a woman\u2019s job. Guess the reason for her leaving him: him earning less or refusal to contribute to chores?", "NTA.  Isaac brought the subject up.  Your short hand description doesn't reveal the tone of your reply.  Since you are friends, can we suppose that you were tactful?  Supposing you were tactful, Isaac's disclosure didn't reveal that to his wife.  He may have put the burden on you for his own feelings of inadequacy.  It's a difficult position to be in.  Just my thoughts offered for you consideration.  Do what you think is right for you.  Be happy.", "NTA\n\nHe said it, you just gave him a nudge.\n\nIt would be different if you brought it up, however that wasn't the case.\n\nSo Isaac went home and cried to his wife? He's a lost cause.", "Yikes. YTA. I hope Isaac can dust himself off and rebuild the confidence you took a sledgehammer to. Pretty sure your friendship is over.", "NTA. He told you his concerns, and you gave him some advice. His confidence wasn't destroyed. It wasn't there in the first place. This is why he spoke to you about it. If he's worried about not earning but has earning potential, then he can look for a better paid job. If he's worried about his wife, then he needs to have a chat with his wife.\n\nIf he didn't like the advice you gave, then he could always have chosen to ignore it. Instead, he went home, had a moan, and she took it upon herself to be offended for him.", "NAH\n\nI wouldnt call you an asshole for that. But your advice wasnt really that great either i think.\nSure you can tell him that you think he is underpaid and could get more. But is it that important? You made his feeling of \"if i dont make more money my wife leaves me\" even stronger - which must be a horrible feeling. My friend would slap my face if i had a thought like that and would tell me my wife loves me even if she makes more money than me. And if she would leave me for money she should f off.", "Well, to be fair you didn\u2019t destroy his confidence, it was already rocky. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re also a guy so I think it\u2019s just the difference between how friends build you up vs how your wife builds you up. I\u2019m sure his wife doesn\u2019t want him to feel inferior b/c now she makes more money but you also told him the truth. If you don\u2019t feel appreciated at your job you look for a better one. That\u2019s a solution to a problem. I\u2019m also sure his wife didn\u2019t intend to marry a \u201cstruggling\u201d engineer. If he loved his job that would be one thing but he doesn\u2019t. I think you should apologize to your friend, let him know his wife contacted you and you didn\u2019t intend to hurt or upset him and ultimately leave it to him and his wife. That\u2019s a marriage issue you shouldn\u2019t involve yourself deeply in\u2026.also be there to support your friend b/c he needs it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nDang Isaac you went home and told your wife bud? Then she text you\u2026..? \nWell you\u2019re not wrong Isaac already had those insecurities.\n\nFrom what you said, I personally don\u2019t see what you say as wrong. Sounds like you try to uplift your friend and give him solutions. \nIsaac could have took what you said with a grain of salt it\u2019s not a radical ideas to look for a better paying job.  You hurt his feelings \nLeave Isaac to figure this out on his own. He\u2019s obviously comfortable. He Skied his wife on you.", "Me thinks that he said 1+2+3 and you answered 6\n\nHe knows his spouse, and it sounds like he fears what may happen and you only told him to do something about it rather than freeze like a deer \ud83e\udd8c \n\nHe needs to stop making excuses, change won't happen unless he does something. Having wifey chew you out sounds more like like a manipulation to get her to feel sorry for him so he doesn't have to try and possibly fail in a new job\n\nWhat he was saying was leading, NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Anyone who doesnt agree should do a quick search  on how much other places pay for the same job", "I'm going to go against the grain here and say NTA. I mean the way it was put was a little dense but I don't really see anything wrong with what he said.\n\nIt wasn't mentioned that this was friend's dream job or absolute passion and friend feels insecure about his job position and his contributions to his house. He is so in a place after 5 years he has the ability and possibilities to change it and its something that can make him feel more confident, so why not do it? For a friend like this one being told 'there there your wife loves you for who you are' is probably not going to help his him and in the long run make him feel even more self conscious.", "I supported my wife for years. As soon as she started earning vaguely the same as me her attitude changed and the level of respect too. Women do marry for their bread winning potential.\n\nThe friend was the one who was worried about his wife leaving him. Not OP.\n\nOP gave career advice. This was solicited advice from the friend. The advice is fair (maybe not the best). Sometimes men need a hard line to motivate them.\n\nOP= NTA\n\nFriend = AH for tattle tailing to his wife what should have stayed a man to man (assuming both males).\n\nLooks like the wife is doing the fighting for him too.", "Yta. Your social skills are really lacking and you come off as arrogant.", "How about she married him because he *wasn't the kind of one-upping jackass who neeeeeeeds to be the higher paid one*? \n\nSO many men are threatened and/or insecure in relationships with successful women and we're sick and damn tired of it. And THAT is what you tell the friend - she's not going to leave a supportive, loving partner for a better paid asshole unless she's an asshole herself.", "From how he writes, I highly doubt he was tactful. He was talking to a friend looking for reassurance and he doubled down on it and said yea she'll leave you for another guy making more money. None of that is tactful. No thought or comment to them as a couple, a relationship is a lot more than just money.", "To be fair, he loves his job. Isaac's wife really wants him to stay at his current job, because he hated the one he had before this. She messaged me things like \"his mental wellbeing is worth more than a little extra money\" and that she would rather have a fun time together with him after work than watch him be absolutely exhausted and fall asleep as soon as he gets home.\n\nWhich is nice and all, but he still suffers mentally due to being underpaid and I'm certain there are plenty of workplaces where he would be both well-paid and happy.", "Yep that\u2019s what I gathered as well he probably didn\u2019t present it to his wife. As a conversation he brought up due to his own insecurities. He could\u2019ve told his wife something along the lines of\n\u201cI told my friend you got a really good paying job. I\u2019m proud of you. He told me I better hurry up and get a better job before you leave me for a better guy.\u201d Just to see what her response would be.", "[deleted]", "Your first line is nonsense. The rest makes sense.", "Yes cause talking to a friend you want stats and facts, not comfort and understanding.", "Absolutely. None of these women commenting seem to acknowledge that this conversation was supposed to be a man-to-man. Isaac is an asshole for disclosing this private convo to his wife. OP gave Isaac solid advice based on statistical evidence, and shouldn't be ashamed for it. It of course would have been rude as hell if OP said this is the presence of Isaac's wife, but again, this was a man-to-man.", "This doesn't even answer his amia question. Huh?", "...you really don't see a problem with using your wife, one woman, as an example as to how all (or most) women are? That doesn't make much sense.", "Lmao. You used your own wife to (in a sense) speak for all women and say that women marry for bread winning potential? What happpened to marrying for love? I\u2019m pretty sure a lot of women marry for love and not financial means\n\n>Women do marry for their bread winning potential\n\nDon\u2019t know where you got this idea from but it's not true", "Assuming all women marry for \"bread winning potential\" is so mess up. You and OP have definitely a problem on the way you view relationships and women. And looks like both like to feel superior to the women by earning more money.\n\nA mature and intelligent person shouldn't care about who has bigger salary on the relationships as long as both are working towards the same goal.\n\nOP = YTA because the mixed message he send on his advise telling that the value of his friend is dictated by his salary.\n\nAnd yes the friend maybe need to change job is they are not paying enough for his work, but only motivation should be professional related no linket to how much his wife will love him", ">Women do marry for their bread winning potential.\n\nThis is sexist, plain, and simple. \n\nFriend was nervous about wife, OP then says you should be, and the only way to keep her is to make more money. That's awful advice and an awful friend. \n\n>Sometimes men need a hard line to motivate them.\n\nWhat does this mean? This could be said for anyone not just men. \n\nWhy is telling his wife bad, OP gave shit advice and told her about it.", "One woman treated you as such now all women have the same attitude? Do you seriously believe NO WOMAN makes more money than their male spouse?", "\nIf your sample size is you, then there\u2019s no reason to think your story proves anything other then you have poor ability to pick a good woman to marry.\n\nOp yta", "This", "You are ignoring the chance that isaacs wife did marry him for that, money. And you cant deny it happened before were  a woman wants to have an equally or more successfull partner. \n\nThere are studis that if you dont feel like googlung i can find for you showing the rate of divorce/being single on high achieving woman, so yeah, isaacs concern has a real basis that it COULD happen. It not men being threatenened, its the chance of happening.\n\nI would love a wife that makes enough money so i can be a stay at home dad, or we both work and she makes more money, idc, but i would enter a relationship like that. If she started earning less and suddenly earned more.... I wouldnt keep my hopes up for to long if i dont improve myself, what op was trying to help with", "Ohh, then yeaaaa. Let them work that out. Don\u2019t feel bad b/c you told him the truth and that\u2019s what friends do but it didn\u2019t help and ultimately it\u2019s a marital issue. Don\u2019t deeply involve yourself. Apologize to him b/c it sounds like you maybe hurt his feelings. Like he has a job he loves and makes him happier but when he expresses doubt about it not being \u201cgood enough\u201d you said \u201c yea bro, it\u2019s really not\u201d. Sometimes it\u2019s just about appreciating what you have vs what you don\u2019t. I\u2019m sure you didn\u2019t intend to hurt him. Still say you\u2019re NTA. Good luck!", "It's not uncommon for someone to disclose their own version of the facts", "Isaac implied this first before OP did. Did you even read the post? And I'm assuming Isaac failed to relay that part to his wife, hence why his wife was angry with OP. \n\nIf my friend tells me that he's worried his wife thinks he's not contributing enough, I'm not gonna pretend I know his wife better than he does. I'd offer the same solid advice OP did.\n\nNTA.", "Why is the first line nonsense? It's just stating a fact? Not saying anything about His actual Situation.\nEnglish is Not my first language that is why i ask. I wanted to merely state a fact.", "The first 3 letters, show my veredict, then i explained why. In case you dont know, nta means not the a hole, yta means your the a hole", "Well I don\u2019t think the advice is shit (especially if Issac is underpaid) but the reasoning and purpose for the advice is shit.", "You mentioned this \u201cfact\u201d to bolster your argument. But later you invalidate it yourself: it doesn\u2019t happen all the time. So it\u2019s a fact that it can happen, but not a fact that it will happen.\nBut OP didn\u2019t say it that way and more like assumed already that it will happen if his friend isn\u2019t improving his financial point. With this he is feeding insecurities of his friend.\n\nFeeding insecurities about something that sometimes can happen is not about a fact, but guesswork or cherrypicking.\n\nNo one knows what his wife is really thinking/feeling. I can just aswell assume she just loves him for the man he is, and couldn\u2019t care less about anyones income.\n\nEdit:typo", "Your explanation is about the job market, not about his friend's wife or their relationship. The friend talks about insecurity and OP responds with facts and builds on his friend's fears. That's not a good friend.", "In the context of why he's asking the advice is shit. He's saying he should get a new job because his wife would leave him if he didn't, which is already his fear. He states it as a fact with no regard to their actual marriage and how they act as a couple.", "Literally this.", "Where do i say all the time? It happens. So the friend's argument was not totally unvalid. Unneeded at that moment and inaapropriate but not untrue.\nAnd yes it can happen. But I never said it will happen and neither die OP.\nAnd yes. It was very inconsiderate for him to say it to an already insecure Guy.\nThat is why I said YTA. But He isn't an AH for stating a simple fact that there are spouses who leave their SO over income disparities and that the persons leaving are predominantly women.", "Thats a true friend that wants to actually help you beyond a pat in the back daying \" everything will be fine she loves you etc etc\"\n\nI love being surrounded by friends who take action if someone needs advice or help, more than just emotional support and leaving you to figure stuff for yourself. In this case isaac is already feeling down about it, so he just got a push in the right direction... Grsnted all he did was go cry to his wife instead of following the advice, but oh well", "Yeah I agree with that. In the context, the reasoning, and the purpose is shit. I agree with what you\u2019re saying. OP is still TA for giving the advice for the context here. \n\nI meant the advice in general, not in this situation. Of course in this situation the advice is shit", "Lol sometimes people just need emotional support. Sometimes it's an irrational problem and they just need reassurance. Not ever issue needs a solution.", "I understand what you are saying but I get his position, I am in a similar one where I could make 20k more if I went someplace new but I like my work, the people, the job, the workload, and my responsibilities. So in my mind just like a marriage, there's more to a job than just the pay.", "Never ran into an issue that didnt have a solution tho, thats the ppi t of issues, they need fixing. If you want a \" everything will be fine \" while your house burns down (methaphorically) get a dog, youll get all the sttention with no help that you want. If you come to me, you leaving with a tangible solution /roadmap to fix any problem you have.\n\n\nA close friend was very sad his mayor didnt have many job openings.... Guess what? Pushed him with a lot of related jobs he never though about and now is happy working and saving for a house. Can give you more if you want, where real.help is the solution un the long term, more than a pat in the back to forget about the issue for the week", "Yeah that is true and now that I think about it, it's easier said than done to get a better job", "Lol never? That is probably the most absurd example considering the issue is wanting a job. I said not every situation needs a solution, I'm not arguing that people need advice, so your example means nothing to me. \n\nWhat about when spouses come from work and vent about their issues at work? Complain about this coworker or that project? Does that mean they should leave and get a new job? No. No job is going to be perfect but being able to vent about it is helpful. Being there for your spouse is important. \n\nAre you married?", "Oh have that issue with my so, where  every time she complains i provide her with an easy solution to all her troubles but she doesnt wanna solve the issue, just complain about it. Not leave and get a new job, but if you have an issue with someone you escalate to  a manager , if nothing happens, to the manager if thst msnager and so forth.\n\nWhen i run into a time i cant provide a tangible solution/ tips on where the solution lies ill be sure ti comment here and ask what to do, since complaining and not fixing snything leads to an unhappy enviroment"]}
