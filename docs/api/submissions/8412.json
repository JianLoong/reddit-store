He told me his wife got a new job with a great pay and she now makes double what he does. Isaac is very proud of her, but he feels like he is falling behind her and not contributing enough. He is afraid that his wife - who works in a very male dominated field, so she is surrounded by well-paid men - will soon have enough of having to carry his weight and will leave him for someone better.\n\nNow Isaac is an engineer with almost 5 years of experience and he is grossly underpaid. I gave him a little speach about how it's not worth it to be loyal to a company. The company doesn't give a shit about him and he should go and find a better paying job out there. It would do good to both his confidence and his marriage. His wife most likely married him because she saw the potential in him, so he now needs to put in the effort and live up to it.\n\nToday, I got a bunch of angry messages from Isaac's wife, calling me an asshole. She accused me of being an awful friend and destroying Isaac's confidence.\n\nQuite frankly, I think that's bullshit, Isaac's confidence was already destroyed and I just gave him tips how to build it up. AITA?\n\n\nEDIT: I want to address the sexism accusations.\n\nI do not believe that women in general just go and leave their husbands when they find a higher earning man. However, I've known Isaac's wife for years now.\n\nShe is a very confident and determined woman, who always achieves what she wants. She makes detailed step-by-step plans for everything and despite being 4 years younger than Isaac, she had already surpassed him in a lot of things. I think it's very easy to feel lacking when you are standing next to her.\n\nIsaac was her first boyfriend ever, she never even kissed anybody else. I think he kind of convinced himself that she only picked him due to her lack of experience with men and as soon as she gets to know someone else a little better, she will realize \"she can do better\".\n\nI'm not saying that will happen, but I can see where Isaac is coming from and I think the solution is to fix up Isaac confidence.", "created_utc": 1674814787, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10mhkmq/aita_for_telling_my_friend_he_should_find_a/", "score": 780, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I gave him a little speach about how it's not worth it to be loyal to a company. The company doesn't give a shit about him and he should go and find a better paying job out there\n\nThis is good advice, and would be very encouraging to hear from a friend - Isaacs skills are valuable, and he should find a job where they are valued as much as he deserves.\n\n>His wife most likely married him because she saw the potential in him, so he now needs to put in the effort and live up to it.\n\nThis is the part that makes you TA. This is where you're equating greater financial success with his wife not leaving him. You're basically insulting them both here - saying that she only loves him as far as his paycheck and would leave him for a guy who makes more money? That's kinda messed up. Your idea of success is not everyone's.", "YTA - why would you assume the reason another person chooses to marry someone?  Newsflash, women aren't out here marrying men just for what they can or cannot provide. We easily know how to fend for ourselves. If your friend feels the need to find a higher paying position because it'd help his own self confidence, then that's fine. However, you don't need to be filling his head with nonsense about how his wife is going to leave him for a better and \"more successful\" man. \n\nThe ignorance here is unfathomable.", "YTA - you didn\u2019t just destroy his confidence by confirming his fear that he is not good enough as he is, you also hinted that his wife is shallow and only wants him for his earning potential.", "Yes, YTA, I also earn much more than my husband. Your speech about the company he works for is not good ect. is fine, but the bit about his wife is really not okay. We no longer live in 1950 in a time when women could not / were not allowed to take care of themselves financially.", "YTA to assume his wife married him because she 'saw the potential in him'.\nHe's not a project and you give her so little credit. \nI understand he might be insecure but that is on him. \nWhy do some men who earn less than their partners are so threatened?\nWe don't live in caves anymore. People can provide for themselves and marry someone they love and want to build a life with.", "YTA\n\nYou insulted him and his wife. You said he was a failure because he doesn't make enough and she was a shallow money grubber who only valued his salary.   \n\n\n *His wife most likely married him because she saw the potential in him,*  Seriously? How about she married him because she liked his cooking or his sex appeal or his great jokes or his all round aweseomeness.   \n\n\nThat's a hideous way to think of a friend.   \n\n\nGranted he should go job hunting because everyone underpaid should, but that is 100% seperate from how his wife feels about him.  But if he likes the work (which wasn't even mentioned?) then her salary means he can stay in a job he enjoys.", "YTA and Issac a little bit too.\n\nYou basically implied that Issac's wife will leave him because he makes less money than his wife. You destroyed his confidence even further and you amplified his fear. Of course if he is grossly underpaid at where he currently works then yeah, great advice to get a better job and aim higher. However, this seems like advice to reach his wife's expectations (expectations I doubt exist)\n\nIssac is a little bit of TA, not for being afraid he isn\u2019t doing enough (even though I personally doubt that) but for also implying that his wife will leave him because he makes less than her. Issac should really consider the fact that maybe she doesn\u2019t care about whether he makes less than her or not and in fact married him for him and not the amount of money he makes\n\nOP your edit doesn\u2019t make this better lol.\n\n>I think he convinced himself that she only picked him due to her lack of experience with men and as soon as she gets to know someone else a little better, she will realize \"she can do better\"\n\nIf that was the case don\u2019t you think she would\u2019ve up and left him by now? I\u2019m pretty sure Issac is not the only man in the world she has encountered in her many years of living. What you should\u2019ve done OP was assured Issac that his wife will not leave him for someone else for financial purposes. I find it hard to believe that Issac was the only man she has ever encountered or dated but I could be wrong", "YTA. And frankly it is laughable that you don't see it. And that you're calling BS on the effect your horrible words had. YTA.", "YTA. Isaac\u2019s wife is right - she saw the effects of what you said to him. You sound really insensitive.", "YTA. You've admitted he's happy where he is, and implied his wife only stays with him because he expects him to earn lots of money. Have you even considered the fact that maybe his wife married him because she loves him? Rather than him being a good money maker?", "You are absolutely an A... and sadly not his friend. Your friends wife is totally right, you should not have said those things. A man is only lovable with a higher paying job or a higher paycheck than his partner? Are you in your 80ies? What a sad and kind of misogynistic standpoint you have concerning love and marriage...", "YTA \n\nYou didn't give Isaac 'tips', you gave him a lecture and made presumptions about the nature of his relationship. His wife most likely married him because she loved him, but you seem to have assumed she has a problem with Isaac earning less than her and will leave him if he doesn't get a better paying job. That's Isaac's worry, and it may not be rooted in reality. His wife might be perfectly happy with his earnings, and there's more to their marriage than money.\n\nFor all you know, Isaac just wanted a listening ear, someone to confide in, but you decided to judge him and the state of his relationship and take it upon yourself to 'fix' him when he didn't ask you to. Did he ask for your advice? Did he ask for a lecture? Or did you decide the way to boost his 'destroyed' confidence was to confirm his fear, essentially call him a failure, and suggest that his wife only wanted him for the money he could bring in?", "YTA, she did not choose him for the potential and you just put into his head that she only loves him for money and expected money, not for him as a being. That she would turn away from him, the second she got a man with more money instead of just telling him: Well if you feel like you do not contribute enough, you can either look for a better paying job or take over more household chores, that is work too, you know. But she loves you for who you are, not for money.\n\nBut no, you decided to tell the man with low confidence, that all his fears are real and his wife does not love him for who he his, but just for the potential money.", "YTA for suggesting wife married him for.\"his potential.\"  However, NTA for suggesting he get a better paying job.", "YTA. Not your lane.", "YTA.  This is such a common theme anymore.  I really think a great piece of advice would have been to seek out therapy.  As female, and an extremely successful one at that,  I see this  all the damn time in the workforce.  I have always made more than the husband and absolutely think he's the greatest thing that ever lived. I can give a rats ass how much he makes and im not sure why men are so intimidated by a high earning female. (To clarify, not the hubby but have seen men he works with be bent out of shape if there is mention the female makes more). If in the relationship there is no history of cheating why would a group of successful men be able to create that conflict?  A person is who they are on the inside.. their morals, values and character are established, especially by their 30s.  I am personally saddened to see how many men think my husband is not the \"man of the house\"..purely based on financial s.   Maybe you should have said, hmm, has your wife cheated previously..no? Oh well is your wife happy with your current job...yes? Are you happy at your current job...yes?  Followed with, Seek therapy my friend, sounds like you have a great wife who cares about you and some deep insecurities that need spoke to a professional about.   \nSorry for the rant,  I get fired up over andrew tate mentality \ud83d\ude05  I'm living proof you can be successful and remain honorable with your partner.", "YTA to his wife. This sounds like something Lucille Bluth would say. It's backhanded. \"Trying to help\" on the surface but undermining someone's marriage along the way.\n\nYou reinforced misogynistic and paranoid ideas about her commitment to him and her values. You basically didn't give her the benefit of the doubt that she actually loves him. \n\nThis is probably the same sexist paranoia that Isaac was trying to fight off. You could have been a good friend and supported their marriage by saying that he should get a better job so he feels good about himself, not so that his wife didn't leave him. Man I'd be pissed if someone said that about me. \n\nHe brought up his own insecurity, why did you have to wrap her into it too? Not everyone in the world is that insecure dude. \n\nHusband needs better friends, obviously. You should apologize for projecting your own insecurity into their relationship.", "You did the right thing, for the wrong reasons. \n\nHe is in a terrible job, where he is being taken advantage of, and you have pointed out the realities of life. Projecting this on his marriage, and what his wife potentially sees in him is inappropriate. You should have stopped while you were ahead. You do not know what his wife is dealing with, and how she is handling the situation.", "YTA\n\nYou should've encouraged him to look for a job that matches his level of education and expertise, but you should've left his wife out of it. You have no idea why she married him, and you should've tried to talk him out of thinking his wife will leave him, not encouraged this thought process.", "YTA. You did not base your advice on the state of the relationship, but rather played into his insecurities. You should have assured him that whatever changed, his wife's commitment to the relationship was not included in that change.\n\nAdvice about his career should have been completely separate from advice about his relationship.", "YTA.\n\nyes if he underpaid def get him to look for something that will respect him but if they are happy there and have no issues why bring it up. just seems like you wanted to put some silly man make more than woman nonsense on him. you played into his fears not up lifting him", "Hm soft YTA for me\u2026 cause I believe your intentions were good, but the way you phrased your concerns and advice were too harsh.. you could\u2019ve given advice that would get on the same point without it sounding so terrible..and definitely not voicing that his wife could leave him, but still encouraging him to find a better job\u2026", "ESH?\n\nI wouldn\u2019t leave a man for someone cause they were paid better and it seems a bit misogynistic you both think that way", "Woah YTA! Youve basically fuelled his insecurities by saying his wife is that shallow that she would leave him for someone with more money! You havent built up his ego at all, youve smashed it even more by saying he isnt living up to the \"potential\" his wife saw in him (in your eyes). God who needs enemies when \"friends\" like you are around!", "YTA. You clearly think a person's salary is the only thing that could make them a good husband. Isaac's wife apparently disagrees, and loves him for reasons other than his money - imagine that! Meanwhile, Isaac has asshole friends like you who tell him she's a materialistic person who will leave him for a colleague because his salary is too low.\n\nShe probably spends tons of time trying to get the stupid idea that his salary matters out of his head while you're out there trying to convince him he's worthless. You are a terrible friend and if I was his wife I'd be exteremly annoyed that he hangs out with you.\n\nYou're right about switching companies etc., but that's not the point. The mere fact that you use 'better' and 'better-paid' as synonyms for people says it all really.", "I'm stuck on Either N A H or E S H if I'm honest. I can understand that he doesn't want to feel like he is having to rely more on his wife and that he wants to be able to contribute, but to conflate that with 'she's going to leave me for a guy with more money' just shows that he is insecure and blaming those insecurities on his wife.\n\nAnd then theres you. Your speech started well, because you're right, the company doesn't give a shit about the individual. But the part where you said she 'married him because she saw potential in him?' Are you sure she didn't just marry him because she **loves him**?\n\nI'm going to go with ESH, except for Isaac's poor wife. She's out there doing what she loves and making bank and all she gets in return is shown how her marriage can only be transactional in his and his best friends eyes.", "NTA, but purely because it wasn't malicious and I think you're just a bit dense.\n\nI agree that he *should* get a better paying job (if he's grossly underpaid), but by focusing on that, and that alone, you kinda made his wife sound like a gold digger.", "YTA and so is Isaac for reinforcing this old stereotype and making her sound like she is only with him for money.\n\nSeriously, have you ever met a high-earning woman that left her husband after a receiving a raise because he makes less? I haven\u2019t. Yes I know there are women that look for a men with a lot of money but they are usually not the ones with high-paying careers. \n\nAnd if you say yes, person X was left because his wife outearned him, do you know her perspective? Because I know a guy that goes around and claims that. Her side sounds different: she worked more hours, hence earned more. Despite her longer hours he refused to even do 30% of chores because apparently that was a woman\u2019s job. Guess the reason for her leaving him: him earning less or refusal to contribute to chores?", "NTA.  Isaac brought the subject up.  Your short hand description doesn't reveal the tone of your reply.  Since you are friends, can we suppose that you were tactful?  Supposing you were tactful, Isaac's disclosure didn't reveal that to his wife.  He may have put the burden on you for his own feelings of inadequacy.  It's a difficult position to be in.  Just my thoughts offered for you consideration.  Do what you think is right for you.  Be happy.", "NTA\n\nHe said it, you just gave him a nudge.\n\nIt would be different if you brought it up, however that wasn't the case.\n\nSo Isaac went home and cried to his wife? He's a lost cause.", "Yikes. YTA. I hope Isaac can dust himself off and rebuild the confidence you took a sledgehammer to. Pretty sure your friendship is over.", "NTA. He told you his concerns, and you gave him some advice. His confidence wasn't destroyed. It wasn't there in the first place. This is why he spoke to you about it. If he's worried about not earning but has earning potential, then he can look for a better paid job. If he's worried about his wife, then he needs to have a chat with his wife.\n\nIf he didn't like the advice you gave, then he could always have chosen to ignore it. Instead, he went home, had a moan, and she took it upon herself to be offended for him.", "NAH\n\nI wouldnt call you an asshole for that. But your advice wasnt really that great either i think.\nSure you can tell him that you think he is underpaid and could get more. But is it that important? You made his feeling of \"if i dont make more money my wife leaves me\" even stronger - which must be a horrible feeling. My friend would slap my face if i had a thought like that and would tell me my wife loves me even if she makes more money than me. And if she would leave me for money she should f off.", "Well, to be fair you didn\u2019t destroy his confidence, it was already rocky. I\u2019m assuming you\u2019re also a guy so I think it\u2019s just the difference between how friends build you up vs how your wife builds you up. I\u2019m sure his wife doesn\u2019t want him to feel inferior b/c now she makes more money but you also told him the truth. If you don\u2019t feel appreciated at your job you look for a better one. That\u2019s a solution to a problem. I\u2019m also sure his wife didn\u2019t intend to marry a \u201cstruggling\u201d engineer. If he loved his job that would be one thing but he doesn\u2019t. I think you should apologize to your friend, let him know his wife contacted you and you didn\u2019t intend to hurt or upset him and ultimately leave it to him and his wife. That\u2019s a marriage issue you shouldn\u2019t involve yourself deeply in\u2026.also be there to support your friend b/c he needs it. NTA.", "NTA\n\nDang Isaac you went home and told your wife bud? Then she text you\u2026..? \nWell you\u2019re not wrong Isaac already had those insecurities.\n\nFrom what you said, I personally don\u2019t see what you say as wrong. Sounds like you try to uplift your friend and give him solutions. \nIsaac could have took what you said with a grain of salt it\u2019s not a radical ideas to look for a better paying job.  You hurt his feelings \nLeave Isaac to figure this out on his own. He\u2019s obviously comfortable. He Skied his wife on you.", "Me thinks that he said 1+2+3 and you answered 6\n\nHe knows his spouse, and it sounds like he fears what may happen and you only told him to do something about it rather than freeze like a deer \ud83e\udd8c \n\nHe needs to stop making excuses, change won't happen unless he does something. Having wifey chew you out sounds more like like a manipulation to get her to feel sorry for him so he doesn't have to try and possibly fail in a new job\n\nWhat he was saying was leading, NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also yes!\n\nAnyone who interprets this conversation as solely based about money must never of had a conversation surrounding being underpaid/valued.", "\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "shit, I dont even have that to offer lol.   most men arent getting laid and dont have a relationship.  did you know that?  you can lump me in with the masses who cant find love because of social media and online dating, including reddit, spreading bullshit to young men.   if you\u2019re a man, make as much money as you can, dress well and take care of yourself.  that will make you attractive.  or be an abusive/cheating bad boy, that is also attractive to women.", "Eeyore was the nickname my parents gave me as a child because I was always sad. That's pretty fucked up in retrospect.", "That's the end of the sentence, smh", "you dont ask a fish, how to catch a fish.  you ask a fisherman", "maybe you feel like he is out of your league and he enjoys the support.  I cant say.  but for the majority of men, becoming successful is the best way to attract a mate.  (PSA to men, dont marry ! they\u2019ll take half)", "so exactly what I said then?", "you\u2019re a bot. run the numbers on what percentage of men are incels in 2023. its not the sick burn you think it is.  hell you might be an incel bot.", "what did they say?   did they say anything about being able to afford a home, new car and support a family on one income?  what a bunch of backwards assholes.   ammmmiiiiright?", "This \"everyone who disagrees with me is a bot\" shit has to stop.

Of course it's a shit move that he validated that fear. Of course his wife is pissed that he made her husband feel like shit and that he insinuated that she will just move on to whatever man has more money than shows her attention.", "OP didn\u2019t talk about any other measure of potential besides income. He didn\u2019t talk about the prestige or power of the wife\u2019s job - he talked about her income doubling. He didn\u2019t say his friend should find a job that treats him better or respects him - just that it should pay better. \n\nI see what you\u2019re saying but to turn this on commenters when money is the only thing OP discussed feels disingenuous.\n\nIf OP meant the wife was attracted to his potential for intelligence, his intelligence isn\u2019t affected by salary.", "That's how I took it. I think getting a job where you're paid your worth and you feel valued would boost his confidence. He's linking some feeling of value to his and her careers. His employer underpays him and doesn't value him. Time to find a place that does both of those things. I didn't read it as \"well make more money then and your wife won't leave you\" but as encompassing the *extra* and *personal* things that come with getting a better job and being happy with your job.\n\nIt's like... \n\nFriend: my wife makes twice what I do and she's successful in her field. I'm feeling insecure\n\nOP: you have what it takes to get a better job. Your current job isn't it. You can get better pay and be treated better and feel more valued", ">and not \"she was attracted to your drive/intelligence and future potential\". Tells a lot about people's pov.\n\nI was pretty much in full agreeance with the friend's pep talk, considering this more of a large objective lens situation rather than solely money - and just that his friend's wife is just in a field that your drive = financial success; edit\\* to which maybe OP's friend might be particularly sensitive about. However, it wasn't until their additional edits that I started feeling more skeptical.\n\n>I do not believe that women in general just go and leave their husbands when they find a higher earning man. However, I've known Isaac's wife for years now.  \n>  \n>Isaac was her first boyfriend ever, she never even kissed anybody else. I think he kind of convinced himself that she only picked him due to her lack of experience with men and as soon as she gets to know someone else a little better, she will realize \"she can do better\".\n\nCoupled with OP's comments about working in an industry with rich men, and this additional comment, is what drove me to be more skeptical of OP's intent behind his words. Like, if you read it in any other way outside of solely financial success - OP would be insulting his friend's intelligence, drive, AND financial securities. Then again, at this point he's writing to all the comments with the edit - not that he shared that information with his friend. I don't think they'd be friends anymore if OP's buddy saw his \"clarification.\" Or maybe it's just OP's insecurities coming out via projection. I just feel like OP dug the hole even deeper.\n\nIdk, I value your point and the principles have merit. I just think you might be giving this guy too much credit.", "right, but you have those conversations AT WORK, not in your personal life. \n\nthe minute you start thinking your spouse might LEAVE YOU because you\u2019re not living up to your potential, you\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot. that shit is not motivating, is equating your value as a human being deserving of love and affection to your productivity. fewer shorter roads straight to anxiety and depression.", "> His wife most likely married him because she saw the potential in him, so he now needs to put in the effort and live up to it.\n\nI like how you skipped this part of OP's post", "Yes, but he explains his reasoning for the recommendation to redditors as \u201chis wife most likely married him because she saw the potential in him, so he now* needs to put in the effort and live up to it.\u201d\n\n*now being the time when she has started earning double his pay.\n\nHe advised the friend to go after a better-paying job -not necessarily a better or higher-ranking job, but a better-paying one. Encouraging someone to leave a job that isn\u2019t challenging or doesn\u2019t pay as much as they could be earning or doesn\u2019t respect their contributions or ability isn\u2019t bad advice by itself. But OP\u2019s friend was worried his wife might leave him over his financial contributions and OP\u2019s advice was to go for more money, accepting the premise that his wife would leave him for not making more.", "Hahahahaha r/niceguys\n\nJust because no women wants you, doesn't mean they all go after money and looks. Many of us don't prioritize that, at all. It's because of your personality.
