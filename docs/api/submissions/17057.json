Did she get you anything?", "NTA and this is perfect for the entitled people subreddit", "NTA\n\n\"No offense but you're not my mother. I only have to wish it to one single person.\"", "Splitting up when you have children is hard on everyone. And, while it\u2019s not *required* for each person to get something for the other on the child\u2019s behalf, it does set the tone for coparenting. Even if it\u2019s just wishing them well on the given day and a card. Remember, you two made that child together. You\u2019re going to be in each other\u2019s life for the rest of your lives. And your children are watching, even when you think they aren\u2019t. I (45f) finally split from my abusive and unfaithful Husband (46m) after 15 years and 3 daughters (19, 19 & 18). I myself am a child of divorce (split by the time I was 3) and the vitriol with which my mother both treated and spoke of my father was atrocious. My father never spoke an ill word about her (even though she is an alcoholic and serial cheater). I cut her off and went full NC 8 years ago and haven\u2019t looked back. My father would always wish her a happy Mother\u2019s Day (through me as she never spoke with him) and she also would often refuse to let me spend Father\u2019s Day with him (I spent summers with him). Because of how I grew up I vowed to not let my children live in a home like that, so unfortunately stayed in a toxic marriage for far too long. But ever since we split I\u2019ve kept it amicable and friendly, we each buy each other something for not only Mother\u2019s Day/Father\u2019s Day, but also birthdays and Christmas. I\u2019ve had him and his new GF (and their new baby) over for thanksgiving, Christmas and NYE. While I am still quite resentful of what he put me through during our time together, I don\u2019t ever want my girls to see or experience that. We coparent even now that they are adults, because children will always need us, and it\u2019s had a huge impact on them in a positive way. Because even though he and I didn\u2019t work out, we created these beautiful humans and I will always be grateful he helped make me a mom. So, while you \u201cdidn\u2019t think about it\u201d I would recommend you do some soul searching and ask yourself what kind of environment you want your child to grow up in. Even though they\u2019re not even old enough to walk, this is the first year you\u2019ve been separated and what you do now is setting the tone for your future coparenting with her. Kindness goes a long way, and soon they will be watching your every move. So be cognizant of the example you want to set for them. I wish you well, and an early Happy Father\u2019s Day.
