While it would be a nice gesture if you got something on behalf of your child for your ex, you are not required to.", "NTA: It's not a law you need to get her anything on her son's behalf. Would it have been nice? Sure, but a lot also depends on your relationship. Is it amicable? Are you involved as much as you can be with your son with the distance? If it's a great relationship put a reminder on your phone for next year if you want.", "You\u2019re supposed to do this if you\u2019re in a relationship with the mother. If you\u2019re not, then it\u2019s not your place. NTA", "NTA\n\nSurely that's now down to her family to do. You're no longer together. My husbands ex doesn't buy him anything from their kids and never has. I always bought for them to give their dad.\n\nI suppose it depends on what type of co-parenting relationship you have. Did you buy each other Christmas and birthday presents off your son? Did she give you something off your son for father's day?", "NTA. No actually you're under no obligation to get your ex a mothers day present.", "INFO: Was/is your current relationship really bad?", "NTA she is your ex.", "That\u2019s a tricky one \nI have a few friends who aren\u2019t together but they still get their childrens other parents something  for Mother\u2019s Day or Father\u2019s Day \n\nIt seems to work well for them all shows the kids that even tho they aren\u2019t together they still respect each other as their child parent  \n\nBut completely depends on your relationship that you have with the other parent.  And how much effort you both put in to raise a kid you both created", "NTA my ex did this for me and it made me hate the present. I do not want anything from that person.\nIt's a manipulation from the other party to claim you  would have to do that.", "NTA it would be nice but you\u2019re not \u201csupposed to\u201d. that\u2019s usually when your kid is able to start speaking and understanding mother\u2019s day like 5ish.", "NTA. It would have been a nice thing to do but its no obligation. The fact that she was gaslighting you to feel regretful makes her TA.", "NTA did she get you anything for Father\u2019s Day? It works both ways. Yes it would be nice as your child is too young to do anything themselves, but it\u2019s not necessary and she shouldn\u2019t just expect it", "NTA. This sounds like she's looking for an excuse to get you to spend money on her and using shame as a weapon against you. She's not your mother and your son sure isn't old enough to be buying her gifts. You don't owe her a gift, not even on her birthday or christmas. You haven't said why you split from her, but she is no longer in your life and I'm sure you're paying child support, so she is an entitled narcissist for expecting a gift from you.", "Generally it\u2019d the done thing for the dad of the child to organise this, and staring at my 10 and 12 yr olds today I know it\u2019s going to fall on dad this year largely too. (And I\u2019m doing his mum \u2026 eyeroll :P )\n\nIn the interests of harmony, as a strategic move that buys you a bucket full of Karma every year that flows for months after\u2026 consider doing this. She birthed you an amazing child, and became a mother\u2026 do it for your kid, and a little for the bonus points it gives you. It will make other things smoother. At least until there\u2019s someone else to take over \u2026\n\nAs for this coming weekend? Why not organise a bunch of groceries to be delivered early in the morning when they are likely home? A surprise gift of some chocolates, some fresh fruits, a loaf of bread and milk, and eggs (to make French toast!) and you have done something nice, and helped out a little too. You can online shop I presume?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit to add judgement: NTA. You are under no obligation.", "NTA That\u2019s common practice if you\u2019re in a relationship but not when you\u2019re separated. You can of course do that but it isn\u2019t a responsibility which falls logically on you. Did she do the same for you on Father\u2019s Day?", "Are all yall saying not the ass seriously saying that he shouldn't at minimum take his kid out to get a gift for her as said child's mother simply because they are not currently dating?! Its be one thing if he wasn't this kids actual dad, but mothers day doesn't matter at all anymore because their not still together? \n\n\nYall think its 100% okay that she doesn't get anything from her kid for mothers day because she's not with the dad anymore even though he fully admits he wasn't very good to her? Mothers day for her doesn't matter because she's a single mom?", "I think a lot of you are AHs. \n\nThat's the mother of your child. I repeat. THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD.  You liked her enough to stick it in her and cum but sending over a box of chocolates is a big deal? Come on. \n\nFor the sake of the child set a precedent so there could be some civility between you two and this way the child might have an easier time dealing with the both of you.", "A light YTA, I've always considered this the done thing to do. Obviously you're in a different country but would have been nice to contact a member of her family and transfer a bit of money for a card/flowers. It's not necessary, but is a nice gesture. My mum never forgave my dad for forgetting her first mother's day lol.", "ESH - you absolutely should recognize the woman who gave birth to your son on Mother's Day, on both his behalf ***AND*** yours. Mother's day is Sunday, so I'm not so sure that she should be \"reminding you\" about something you haven't missed yet. It says something about her that she felt the need to bring it up before the event actually happened.\n\nAlso, no this doesn't make you a horrible person and you probably didn't know. But please make it right.", "ESH\n\nYou need to acknowledge her on Mother\u2019s Day because she is the mother of your child. That doesn\u2019t end when the romantic relationship is over. It only ends if one of you decides to permanently disown the child you have together. A card is a fine form of acknowledgment. \n\nShe is ta for refusing to forgive you before you\u2019ve even fucked up. There is still time for you to have flowers shipped to her. (Card would have been cheaper but it doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019ll be able to get it there in time.)", "Soft YTA. You\u2019re no longer in a relationship so I understand it might not be necessary but it is a good example to set for your child. They may be a baby now but a tradition showing respect to your child\u2019s mother is a great thing to do.", "NTA \n\nYour ex ain't your mom.", "NTA. You are seperated. It would be a nice thing to acknowledge her as the mother of your child but not something reasonable to expect. She sounds high-maintenence. Does she celebrate you on fathers day?", "NTA \n\nI think it\u2019s a really nice gesture to do that for the mother of your child, but it\u2019s not a requirement, especially when you\u2019re no longer dating. \n\nYou apologised and tried to make it up to her, I think her reaction of not forgiving you is over the top", "NTA\n\nmothers day is for your own mother bruh", "You still have time. Place an order for a bouquet of flowers to be delivered and if theres a spa nearby, send a voucher.\n\nYou still have time\n\nNo judgement here, I had a partner living with me who ignored my first mothers day so (imo) not thinking of your ex, while not great, is also understandable if this is a situation you have no context for and one you want to remedy", "WTF? NTA, not at all lol. My ex has never once gotten me anything for mother's day from my son since we split and I've never expected him to. He's my EX, his obligation to buy me presents went bye bye the second we ended our romantic relationship and became co-parents.

It is a best practice though to help your child pick out a present for their other parent, at the very least help them make a card etc once they\u2019re old enough to participate. It\u2019s definitely one of the easiest things to do to make having separated parents easier on the kid.\n\nMy ex and I don\u2019t get along at all but you should see how my kids beam with pride when they have a present to give either of us on birthdays, mother\u2019s/Father\u2019s Day, Christmas etc. It\u2019s for the kids. It\u2019s not for your ex.", "NTA.  I have seen lots of stories where exes take their kids to the store for flowers or candy to take back to mom to demonstrate that their mom is important or how to properly treat a lady but from a different country and while your LO is only 1 that will be difficult unless you Amazon prime her something (depending on her location and availability or similar option)", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAlthough I will say it will show your kid just a simple way to be kind as he gets older. She may not be your partner but she is your child\u2019s mother and it\u2019s nice to show appreciation of that once a year. She was kind of a AH for her reaction. I wouldn\u2019t have said a word if I was her but that\u2019s just me", "NTA as it's not required and legitimately not something you probably thought about, but it is a nice gesture. I do not get along with my ex, but I always help my kids get things to give her for Mother's Day. Nothing big or anything, but it's really no trouble to pick up a few things, throw in a bag, and give to the kids to take to their mom's.\n\nRemember, it's not about you or her, it's about the kids. Seeing as he's 1, it's no big deal as he won't remember. In the future, I'd recommend doing it for his sake.", "NTA.  People who care about their partner/ex-partner, or who want to instill the importance of Mother's Day to their kids, will do something on behalf of the kids for the mom. But, since you are not her partner anymore, and you don't care to instill Mother's Day in your child, I guess you're off the hook. She is also off the hook for doing the same for you for Father's Day. Now, you just need to communicate that to avoid hurt feelings all around going forward.", "NTA.  You\u2019re no longer responsible for her happiness.", "I guess that's just cultural differences but I've never heard of a mother receiving a gift from anyone other than their child for Mother's day. NTA anyway", "She is your EX. You are not obligated to get her anything. \n\nIf you want to go with your son so HE can get her something that is completely different but YOU do not owe her anything.\n\nNTA", "Nope...NTA", "I completely agree with this. When your child is older I would encourage you to help them do something for her only because 1- it is their mother and you are supporting your child, not your ex and 2- you're teaching your child how to treat people. \nAt age 1 the child doesn't know and isn't expected to do anything.", "Totally disagree. It absolutely is your place as the parent, not the partner of the other parent. You don't encourage your children to respect their parents for the parents, you do it to teach the child how to treat people they love.", "Yeah, she is annoyed because I never bought something on behalf of my son. If that makes sense. Not directly from me.\n\nIn terms of presents, not anymore. We didn't do Christmas presents this year. She didn't get me anything for my birthday, and I only got her a card this year for hers.", "There's a few comments on here which I'll try to answer in due course. I saw this one first so I'll give an answer now.\n\nThe relationship with her is terrible. I made many mistakes with her in the past which I 100% accept and know I should do better. But it's hard for her to forgive them, so she talks to me rudely quite often, and makes it difficult for me to see my son.\n\nThings are at their all time low basically.

OP should encourage his child (when child is old enough to understand) to respectfully memorialize his parent (as long as they are deserving of the respect - head that off in advance \ud83d\ude44), as long as it's not resulting in a financial hardship. Jfc, is it so hard to be decent to other people? No wonder the world is such a hateful place. Btw, there is a vast difference between being entitled and expecting common courtesy/decency.", "\"Jfc, is it so hard to be decent to other people?\"\n\nIronic, considering you told me to fuck off in your first response to me.", "Boo hoo, I cursed when you made a ridiculous point. \ud83e\udee3\ud83d\ude02 Sure, do nothing for your child until you arbitrarily decide they are old enough to finally understand and THEN start teaching them etiquette, instead of from the start.
