This year my brother wants to set an alarm at 9AM to go on a \u201cmorning walk\u201d. He has never done this before and I\u2019m convinced he\u2019s just doing it to annoy me. I told him I forbid him from setting that alarm and he told me I did the same thing last year, except last year I actually wanted to go to the gym. He called me a massive hypocrite and stormed off.
