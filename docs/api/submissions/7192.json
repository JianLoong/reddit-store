That was incredibly helpful and also made me feel like it\u2019s not just me and that I\u2019m not alone \u2764\ufe0f thank you! \n\nI also wanted to address the comments saying \u201crun\u201d, \u201cdivorce\u201d and \u201cabortion\u201d. I get that you might think that is helpful but I am pregnant. I don\u2019t think now is the time for mourning the end of a relationship. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the correct time for drudging up trauma either and healing through therapy. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell someone to abort. The same way I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell someone not to. I hope that you respect those decisions. \n\nAs for therapy, I am considering it after the baby is born. That was a take away I did not expect to even be on my mind after posting that. \n\nSo here\u2019s the update,\nI spoke to him using a lot of the advice given to me. We came to an agreement on how to get the house cleaned up and that he needed to take responsibility as a father. We also discussed how being a parent is not a job but rather a role that we much both fulfil. \nWithout you guys I would never have been able to word that the way I wanted to, so thank you. \n\nHe took a day off, watched baby the entire day. I could tell it wasn\u2019t easy because our baby is difficult and clingy, but he didn\u2019t complain at all. The house is now, finally, CLEAN. Not just tidy but actually clean. \n\nI think we needed to work on communication and making each other feel valid on their struggles rather than playing oppression Olympics with each other. Again, sounds like common sense but redditors really helped me to put that into perspective. I\u2019m not innocent here either as the \u201cyta\u201ds and \u201cesh\u201ds ~kindly~ pointed out\n\nThank you for all the Facebook groups and book recommendations too. I will be taking my baby to the doctors (when they finally give me an appointment) and I am going to take every single suggestion to find out if there\u2019s a reason he is not sleeping well. Until then, dad has offered to take one night a week on weekends he is not working. That itself is a huge HUGE weight off my shoulders. \n\nThank you AITA \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1673576400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10aidys/update_aita_for_asking_my_partner_to_take_the/", "score": 369, "replies": ["Congratulations on the improvement!  I hope you, hubby and baby(s) keep thriving!", "I don't know if this was mentioned on the first post, but your are nursing a baby and growing a baby but said some days you barely eat or drink... I am thinking the baby may not be getting enough nourishment.  Have you thought about using formula before bedtime?  Formula also takes longer to digest so the baby may sleep longer (worked for me!)\nAnyway, check with your pediatrician to see what your best options are, and good luck!", "Ngl, what are you gonna do with the baby when you\u2019re farther along your pregnancy? How are you gonna fulfill responsibilities? Girl you need to have family help too\u2026", "Check with the pediatrician and your OB. My mom was nursing my sister when she got pregnant with me. It affected her milk and was making my sister have a bad stomach.", "Great work and I hope the communication continues. Also, love the phrase \u201coppression Olympics!\u201d", "Do you really think this is going to get BETTER with two babies?", "Can you not hire a maid to clean?\n\nAlso, your first post made me livid when he said you didn\u2019t work.  Your \u201cwork\u201d is 24/7!\n\nHe needs to value your \u201cwork\u201d and \u201ccontribution\u201d.\n\nAlso, you need a break.  Time to catch up on sleep.  Maybe a babysitter for a half a day sometimes so you can sleep?\n\nJust practical ideas to keep you sane.\n\nGood luck!", "Yay! Sleep good! Communication good! Good job mama!", "This is such an awesome update.  I hope you continue to move forward with such positivity together and the pediatrician can help your baby sleep!!", "Communication For The Win!!\n\nBest of luck, prosperity, and love to you and yours!", "wait but why not abort advice?", "I love this for you, the compromise sounds great\ud83d\udc4c", "Also you might want to check with either of your families medical history.  My daughter didn\u2019t sleep well into her toddler years - 4 years of a lot of sleepless nights \ud83d\ude12 and still some night terrors and weird sleep cycles - I finally figured it out - my husband and his dad and brother have HORRIBLE SLEEP ISSUES - it was genetic.  So as she got older, we just tried different things, wind down time, reading, no tv an hour before sleep and eventually it got a lot better.  I wish you well tired momma", "communication almost always works. i\u2019m glad you guys are communicating with eachother!!", "Thank you \u2764\ufe0f", "Some people just don't want abortion for themselves. This is why is called pro choice. It is a choice and trying to convince someone otherwise is just trying to take the choice from them which is defeating the whole point", "No but some people, like me, couldn\u2019t live with their selves if they choose an abortion. I choose to parent my baby after her dad broke up with me the same day I found out I was pregnant. It was hard and an uphill battle some days but I don\u2019t one day of my life regret my daughter. I support abortion and am pro choice and would drive my daughter to the appt if she requested one with no judgement but I\u2019d also support her if she choose to parent with a worthless baby daddy. \n\nI\u2019d highly recommend op go on birth control or get her tubes tied if she decides to stay with her husband and he doesn\u2019t get any better though.", "Two babies and doing no work to actually fix it. Like he won't backslide in a week.", "I feel like sahm/d should be treated like a job. A stay at home parent, should be doing exclusive baby/house/errand work between 9a-5p (or whatever hours the spouse works) that includes a break. Whether it\u2019s mid day during a nap or when the partner comes home and they get the baby for an hour so the stay at home parent can rest. Then from that point forward both parents do things equally until the next work \u201cshift.\u201d People who work outside the home think the person at home has it so easy so they should do all things at all times with zero input or help. Then the stay at home parent thinks the person outside the home has it better because they can take breaks, balance their time, and not constantly on the go. I feel like that\u2019s a better approach than the \u201cyou\u2019re home all day and I\u2019m tired\u201d bs excuse some people have.", "I hope this works out, truly. Be aware of backsliding- it is easy to step up for a week or two, but you need 18 years of him stepping up every day. Tread carefully; you need a permanent change, not a short- term one.", "I hope you work on having a happy life for yourself and not just struggle through the day. You deserve better.", "YTA for having 2 kids with this lazy father.", "Glad things are a bit better. Still kinda concerned your husband met you when you were 17 and he was 27... Then immediately had two children with him when you were legal.", "this!! i was going say this!", "Yep, I don't have kids, but from those I know that do, 1 baby is like 1 baby, 2 babies are like 10. They are in for a real hard time.", "Ehh communication is great but it doesn't solve all problems", "Because not everyone agrees or would personally have an abortion?", "Presenting information is not taking the choice from her.", "I'm not suggesting an abortion. I'm saying his behavior is going to either be just as bad or worse. She needs to leave now and get a REAL support system for her soon-to-be 2 children.", "Even though it will harm two babies.", "Don\u2019t worry guys, it\u2019s been five minutes and the man babysat his own child for a whole day. Problem solved.", "What part of my comment suggests an abortion? It's the husband she needs to get rid of, not the pregnancy", "She is fully aware of her choices and has already stated that she has made her choice. People need to respect that even if they don't agree with it.", "She's only 22 and is a SAHM. Her whole adult life has been being this guys wife/maid/mother of him and his children. Give her a few years to grow up and mature. \n\nHopefully by then she'll have realized a few things \ud83d\ude4f \n\nAnd hopefully she starts saving money now, so when she *does* realize, she's not stuck for longer.", "Jesus Christ all of these replies acting like you suggested that OP should abort her pregnancy, you're getting roasted for no reason lmao", "To be frank, I didn't even read the comment above as pushing her towards anything but getting rid of her husband, who is being seriously dead weight. If all he's providing is money, he can do that without also being a stress factor in her life.\n\nBut I digress. Mentioning that you don't think something is the best idea is not *not* respecting someone's choice, and I really resent this false equivalence that a suggestion is anywhere near the same as pressuring someone.", ">I really resent this false equivalence that a suggestion is anywhere near the same as pressuring someone.\n\nIn situations like this; where the person has said flat out \"I've decided on XXX\"; it is pressuring that person to \"suggest\" otherwise. The \"suggestion\", at that point, is simply telling the other person \"You're wrong and you need to do what I tell you to do\". You can try to slap any amount of lipstick on the \"suggestion\" but it's still pressuring the person to go against their decision.", "That's exactly what I meant.", "All they said was \"do you think this will get better with two children\", how is that pressuring anyone to do anything?\n\nIt's literally just a rhetorical question, presenting barely even an opinion but the literal reality of the situation!", "Right? So this talk of pushing her towards abortion is just serious projection on the part of that commenter above.", "It was judgemental. Leave your judgements at the assholeishness, not a woman's reproductive decisions, unless she asks for your opinion.", "Projection is taking traits/emotions you have and assigning them to someone else. That commentator was not doing that. Don\u2019t use words you don\u2019t know"]}
