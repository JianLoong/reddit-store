That was incredibly helpful and also made me feel like it\u2019s not just me and that I\u2019m not alone \u2764\ufe0f thank you! \n\nI also wanted to address the comments saying \u201crun\u201d, \u201cdivorce\u201d and \u201cabortion\u201d. I get that you might think that is helpful but I am pregnant. I don\u2019t think now is the time for mourning the end of a relationship. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the correct time for drudging up trauma either and healing through therapy. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell someone to abort. The same way I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell someone not to. I hope that you respect those decisions. \n\nAs for therapy, I am considering it after the baby is born. That was a take away I did not expect to even be on my mind after posting that. \n\nSo here\u2019s the update,\nI spoke to him using a lot of the advice given to me. We came to an agreement on how to get the house cleaned up and that he needed to take responsibility as a father. We also discussed how being a parent is not a job but rather a role that we much both fulfil. \nWithout you guys I would never have been able to word that the way I wanted to, so thank you. \n\nHe took a day off, watched baby the entire day. I could tell it wasn\u2019t easy because our baby is difficult and clingy, but he didn\u2019t complain at all. The house is now, finally, CLEAN. Not just tidy but actually clean. \n\nI think we needed to work on communication and making each other feel valid on their struggles rather than playing oppression Olympics with each other. Again, sounds like common sense but redditors really helped me to put that into perspective. I\u2019m not innocent here either as the \u201cyta\u201ds and \u201cesh\u201ds ~kindly~ pointed out\n\nThank you for all the Facebook groups and book recommendations too. I will be taking my baby to the doctors (when they finally give me an appointment) and I am going to take every single suggestion to find out if there\u2019s a reason he is not sleeping well. Until then, dad has offered to take one night a week on weekends he is not working. That itself is a huge HUGE weight off my shoulders. \n\nThank you AITA \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1673576400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10aidys/update_aita_for_asking_my_partner_to_take_the/", "score": 959, "replies": ["Congratulations on the improvement!

Ultimately ended up with essentially the Moms on Call method.  If you are seeing a sleep consultant and getting no results - try someone else.  It is definitely true - some babies just don't sleep.  The difference in total sleep time with this child and their later children was truly jaw dropping.  But you should see SOME improvement, and definitely longer stretches than an hour.

I know it keeps me grounded, it\u2019s not easy making decisions that shape entire lives (when none of us truly feel ready to even adult and decide our own lives). You got this - all the best!", "I also had a child like this. I could not have managed the evry day tasks without my babybj\u00f6rn baby carrier, I would put it on backwards so I  carried her on my back instead of on my front when I was doing \"stuff\" around the house.\nAnd for the nights I recorded stories from childrens books. I think 3 ore 4 diffrent in a loop so she could hear my voice at night, I put my shirt for the day on a pillow in her bed for my smell and she got a little bit \"heavyer\" formula for the night. She didn't sleep all night but much much beter.\n\nYou are doing a good job, good luck!", "Our little one was a nightmare when she was little with colic/wind/fussy - what worked for us in the end was all going to bed together and i would have little one on my side of the bed to comfort and sort out until the first time they woke up after midnight. I would then go into the other room to get sleep before work the next day, this would give my wife 3-4 hours of solid sleep knowing i would deal with baby.\n\nMy wife would then take over being 'on duty', on good nights she would wake up once or twice and top up her sleep in the meantime. On bad nights they would both sleep in until late, it was tough leaving the house with them both sleeping peacefully. \n\nAs to the cleaning, all i can say is for you both to do little bits here and there to try and stop it becoming a massive mess. We are all currently getting over bad flu and have lapsed on this big time so i know how stressful a messy kitchen is when all you want to do it cook tea!", "There's just something so unappealing about people asking for suggestions in AITA and then getting defensive or arguing in the comments.", "And it\u2019ll be a lot harder to find time for it when there are two babies to take care of instead of one", "Or, you know, just east more.", "Jumping on the top comment to say look into your local councils Infant Feedings/nutrition services, some will help with different formulas and vitamin vouchers etc! Also pls have a word with your dr about what supplements you should be taking as a breastfeeding mum, can help the baby sleep if their nutrition needs are being met and could help you a lot if you\u2019re struggling to find time to eat, it\u2019s not a long term solution by any means but do explore it please \u263a\ufe0f best of luck angel I\u2019m sure you\u2019re doing a fabulous job (especially for a young mother) x", "This was me! We switched to breastmilk during the day and formula at night. Complete difference! Even if you just get a bottle of ready feed to try for like $9  it might be worth it", "My sister who reproduced asked me (well she was probably asking Mom but I was there, and have worked in the medical field) why her son was always hungry and not gaining as much weight as he should, also it turned out he was fussy and not sleeping well. My first question was about her diet. Yeah she was trying to lose the baby weight while also breastfeeding... I told her either switch to formula or take in enough nutrition to feed him. You can't have it both ways.\n\nOP, I know you aren't purposely on a diet but if you aren't eating well your baby (both of them, actually) isn't eating well either. Not having proper nutrition hurts all three of you. I'm not saying it to shame or accuse, but I'm an attempt to help. Set timers for eating if you have to, have snacks on hand that you can have without much effort. Like cheese sticks, those packs that are tuna and crackers, nuts, trail mix, yogurt, anything with protein. And enough veggies at meals to make sure of that aspect too, but your protein intake is a big one while breastfeeding or pregnant. Oh, also chicken broth and crackers if you literally can't stomach stuff because of the pregnancy. I found some bone broth on Amazon that has tumeric and ginger. Ginger is one of the best things for seeking the stomach there is, for many people it works even better than prescriptions!\n\nDuring my pregnancy I often went without eating because I don't always feel hunger and I was queasy literally from about five weeks in until I gave birth. That's how I found out, actually, I thought I had the flu or something so went to the doctor to get a note for work. Nope, pregnant. And I developed severe blood sugar issues because I wasn't eating regularly. The snacks I suggested are what I was told to use so I could eat without effort and prevent fainting spells.", "She doesn't even drive, is dependent on him for everything \n\nThere's bad decisions and then there's OPs life", "Surprisingly there\u2019s some babies who hate baby carriers. Mine was one, tried so much but he always wanted out the second he got in.", "Oh! I didn\u2019t know this was a thing, I\u2019ll ask my gp today!!", "Yeah I\u2019ve been wanting to explore that but soy doesn\u2019t seem to sit well with him and I\u2019ve not been able to find any other alternatives. If you have any recommendations I\u2019d love them!! It could just be giving him bad reflux but he vomited almost immediately after trying the sma one", "Thank you \ud83d\udc95", "Communication almost always works when the husband didn\u2019t groom the wife.", "I wouldn\u2019t consider \u201cdivorce\u201d when I\u2019m financially dependent and have no support system a good suggestion. And abortion isn\u2019t exactly something I expected people to comment on, as it\u2019s a personal choice. But if you have any advice beyond that, I think you\u2019ll find id be very greatful to accept it", "They're actually kinda average.\n\nIt might sound utterly unbelievable if you have an immature man that shirks his responsibilities as a grown man living in a place with kids.\n\nI would suggest couples therapy.and it can easily start before the birth so you'll actually have a partner, not just \"some help\" when the second baby comes along.\n\nI've got two of my own, and had a great partner for the second child. An abuser for the first. And the first one acted like your husband.\n\nIf he doesn't want to look like an abuser, he should deal with his emotional stuff that prevents him from taking on 100% of the responsibility. That is what couples therapy is for. \n\nBecause that's what most adult partners do. They both take 100% responsibility for their home and family.\n\nYou already know it is possible: you're already doing that. You see it needing to be done, you want to deal with it.\n\nI live in a country where therapy is not an everyday thing, not like the US makes it seem like.\n\nI don't know a single long term relationship or marriage in my surroundings that has gone without couples therapy at one or several points. They usually only mention it once you mention you are thinking about/doing it yourselves.\n\nApart from the 70+ year olds.\n\nAlso, its less tiring in a home where you've got 1 adult and kids, than the same but also 1 antagonistic, unhelpful \"teenager\" that only does as he's told once you have stern talks all the time.\n\nHe might have \"mom zoned\" you. Not as the mother of his kids, but acting as if your *his* mother. Acting like he's your slightly incompetent teenage son. That will only do things once you command him. And otherwise just let's everything slide because he's working on his independence and you're the adult of the home, not him.\n\nExtremely common in otherwise good men! Again, couples therapy...", "Listen saying the legal age is 16 does not mean a thing.

Quality doesn't drop though.", ">I can understand why you'd think this but mum would have to be severely malnourished for it to affect the milk. A bad diet with only affect mum, as the body will always prioritise making milk.\n\nI'm sorry, but this is NOT true! A bad diet will affect the mother AND the milk! What do you think the milk is made of? If the mother is deficient in nutrients, the milk can't contain nutrients the mother doesn't have. The body doesn't work that way! The body can only produce based on what it is given & on what it can make from what it is given. It is extremely important for nursing mothers to pay attention to what they eat and to their baby's feeding. If the child is not thriving or having difficulty eating, which does happen, they need to move to formula. Giving a baby breast milk isn't going to make the baby a brain surgeon, a successful lawyer or a billionaire any more than formula feeding will, and we have to get out of the mindset of telling new mothers that breast milk is the only way. It is not! In addition to vitamin & mineral deficiencies, there are many diseases that a mother can pass to their child through breast milk! It is important that new mother's know this and  don't feel ashamed if they need to switch to formula.", "Smell steps are the beginning of a bigger journey. Don't take mind to all the naysayers. Maybe they don't have life experience or have never had kids, I dunno. But as long as DH keeps working on helping and you both working on compromise it sounds like you'll get through this. I only had the one child but my late husband (when he wasn't away of tours of duty), used to muck in and get his hands dirty all the time. He adored his darling little girl. He was killed in action when she was 17 but boy! Wouldn't he be proud now. She got married, had identical twin girls and is a Dr at Great Ormand Street Children's Hospital.
