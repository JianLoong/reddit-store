That was incredibly helpful and also made me feel like it\u2019s not just me and that I\u2019m not alone \u2764\ufe0f thank you! \n\nI also wanted to address the comments saying \u201crun\u201d, \u201cdivorce\u201d and \u201cabortion\u201d. I get that you might think that is helpful but I am pregnant. I don\u2019t think now is the time for mourning the end of a relationship. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the correct time for drudging up trauma either and healing through therapy. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell someone to abort. The same way I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell someone not to. I hope that you respect those decisions. \n\nAs for therapy, I am considering it after the baby is born. That was a take away I did not expect to even be on my mind after posting that. \n\nSo here\u2019s the update,\nI spoke to him using a lot of the advice given to me. We came to an agreement on how to get the house cleaned up and that he needed to take responsibility as a father. We also discussed how being a parent is not a job but rather a role that we much both fulfil. \nWithout you guys I would never have been able to word that the way I wanted to, so thank you. \n\nHe took a day off, watched baby the entire day. I could tell it wasn\u2019t easy because our baby is difficult and clingy, but he didn\u2019t complain at all. The house is now, finally, CLEAN. Not just tidy but actually clean. \n\nI think we needed to work on communication and making each other feel valid on their struggles rather than playing oppression Olympics with each other. Again, sounds like common sense but redditors really helped me to put that into perspective. I\u2019m not innocent here either as the \u201cyta\u201ds and \u201cesh\u201ds ~kindly~ pointed out\n\nThank you for all the Facebook groups and book recommendations too. I will be taking my baby to the doctors (when they finally give me an appointment) and I am going to take every single suggestion to find out if there\u2019s a reason he is not sleeping well. Until then, dad has offered to take one night a week on weekends he is not working. That itself is a huge HUGE weight off my shoulders. \n\nThank you AITA \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1673576400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10aidys/update_aita_for_asking_my_partner_to_take_the/", "score": 1395, "replies": ["Congratulations on the improvement!

They got through it with the help of a lot of family and a nanny, and truly the child and the marriage are thriving as they got over the first horrible years (yes, he was a cantankerous toddler, as well).  You are a warrior for doing 95% of this on your own!  \n\nIn case you have not tried these things - they definitely found their baby had a lot of gas.

Ultimately ended up with essentially the Moms on Call method.  If you are seeing a sleep consultant and getting no results - try someone else.  It is definitely true - some babies just don't sleep.  The difference in total sleep time with this child and their later children was truly jaw dropping.  But you should see SOME improvement, and definitely longer stretches than an hour.

I could not have managed the evry day tasks without my babybj\u00f6rn baby carrier, I would put it on backwards so I  carried her on my back instead of on my front when I was doing \"stuff\" around the house.\nAnd for the nights I recorded stories from childrens books. I think 3 ore 4 diffrent in a loop so she could hear my voice at night, I put my shirt for the day on a pillow in her bed for my smell and she got a little bit \"heavyer\" formula for the night. She didn't sleep all night but much much beter.\n\nYou are doing a good job, good luck!", "Our little one was a nightmare when she was little with colic/wind/fussy - what worked for us in the end was all going to bed together and i would have little one on my side of the bed to comfort and sort out until the first time they woke up after midnight. I would then go into the other room to get sleep before work the next day, this would give my wife 3-4 hours of solid sleep knowing i would deal with baby.\n\nMy wife would then take over being 'on duty', on good nights she would wake up once or twice and top up her sleep in the meantime. On bad nights they would both sleep in until late, it was tough leaving the house with them both sleeping peacefully. \n\nAs to the cleaning, all i can say is for you both to do little bits here and there to try and stop it becoming a massive mess.

We switched to breastmilk during the day and formula at night. Complete difference!

My first question was about her diet. Yeah she was trying to lose the baby weight while also breastfeeding... I told her either switch to formula or take in enough nutrition to feed him. You can't have it both ways.\n\nOP, I know you aren't purposely on a diet but if you aren't eating well your baby (both of them, actually) isn't eating well either. Not having proper nutrition hurts all three of you. I'm not saying it to shame or accuse, but I'm an attempt to help. Set timers for eating if you have to, have snacks on hand that you can have without much effort. Like cheese sticks, those packs that are tuna and crackers, nuts, trail mix, yogurt, anything with protein. And enough veggies at meals to make sure of that aspect too, but your protein intake is a big one while breastfeeding or pregnant. Oh, also chicken broth and crackers if you literally can't stomach stuff because of the pregnancy. I found some bone broth on Amazon that has tumeric and ginger. Ginger is one of the best things for seeking the stomach there is, for many people it works even better than prescriptions!\n\nDuring my pregnancy I often went without eating because I don't always feel hunger and I was queasy literally from about five weeks in until I gave birth. That's how I found out, actually, I thought I had the flu or something so went to the doctor to get a note for work. Nope, pregnant. And I developed severe blood sugar issues because I wasn't eating regularly.

An abuser for the first. And the first one acted like your husband.\n\nIf he doesn't want to look like an abuser, he should deal with his emotional stuff that prevents him from taking on 100% of the responsibility. That is what couples therapy is for. \n\nBecause that's what most adult partners do. They both take 100% responsibility for their home and family.\n\nYou already know it is possible: you're already doing that. You see it needing to be done, you want to deal with it.\n\nI live in a country where therapy is not an everyday thing, not like the US makes it seem like.\n\nI don't know a single long term relationship or marriage in my surroundings that has gone without couples therapy at one or several points. They usually only mention it once you mention you are thinking about/doing it yourselves.\n\nApart from the 70+ year olds.\n\nAlso, its less tiring in a home where you've got 1 adult and kids, than the same but also 1 antagonistic, unhelpful \"teenager\" that only does as he's told once you have stern talks all the time.\n\nHe might have \"mom zoned\" you. Not as the mother of his kids, but acting as if your *his* mother. Acting like he's your slightly incompetent teenage son. That will only do things once you command him.

A bad diet with only affect mum, as the body will always prioritise making milk.\n\nI'm sorry, but this is NOT true! A bad diet will affect the mother AND the milk! What do you think the milk is made of? If the mother is deficient in nutrients, the milk can't contain nutrients the mother doesn't have. The body doesn't work that way! The body can only produce based on what it is given & on what it can make from what it is given. It is extremely important for nursing mothers to pay attention to what they eat and to their baby's feeding. If the child is not thriving or having difficulty eating, which does happen, they need to move to formula. Giving a baby breast milk isn't going to make the baby a brain surgeon, a successful lawyer or a billionaire any more than formula feeding will, and we have to get out of the mindset of telling new mothers that breast milk is the only way. It is not! In addition to vitamin & mineral deficiencies, there are many diseases that a mother can pass to their child through breast milk!

Comment-OP recommended a thing that *may* help. They're clear that it's not guaranteed to help, but it's a low-risk intervention. Calling that \"not always helpful\" because it does not always solve the problem seems uncalled for to me. I mean, by all means, highlight that it's not guaranteed, but to me your post seems needlessly dismissive.", "OP. My advice is you start planning and thinking how you could break away from this dependent relationship. I'm sorry you have received harsh comments, but these are providing a very much needed reality check, that sadly no-one around you is giving you. This situation isn't going to get better. You need to figure out what training you could do to have a job and career for yourself. There are many at home learnings you can do - hell, you can apparently learn to code in 6 weeks online, for free. You NEED to find a way out of this for yourself, and for your children. And for the love of God, please go on birth control after this baby.", "The advice is to make him use his fancy doctor salary for a babysitter so you can get a job or go back to school so you're not reliant on him and when he goes back on his promises (or leaves you for another 17 year old in a vulnerable situation), you can safely leave.", "Yup. \u201cI\u2019m totally fine he\u2019s helping once a week and in the evening a little\u201d\n\nLike yah\u2026 he groomed you to be a live in domestic unpaid servant\u2026 table scraps look good to a dog", "They didn't say abortion. They could've just as easily been inferring that she should leave her husband. Because tbh, a partner's behaviour doesn't usually get better when you add children to the mix.\n\nIt's noble of OP to try and save the relationship. But there's also a good chance it's a little bit naive. Plenty of people swear up and down that they'll change; do it hundreds of times, even. Very few actually do. More often they change for about a month, until they feel \"safe\" in the relationship again.   \nLasting change to an established behaviour pattern is very, very, very difficult. It's something you have to actively work at for years if not decades - and most people don't do that. Most people stop working at it when they feel the crisis is over.\n\nIn my view, they're - rightfully - warning OP that this situation isn't all that likely to get better at this point. If OP chooses to stay, they're deciding they could tolerate living like that for the rest of their life. I just hope they're aware of that.", "The point is she needs to break up with him because this is gonna keep happening", "She doesn't have to have an abortion to dump him. The problem is not the extra kid, it's her significant other that she had to sit down like a child to explain that he has to help with the baby and his new level of involvement is occasionally taking the kid so she can continue cleaning up for him. \n\nShe needs to leave him because this is a bad situation for her.", "She is still so young \ud83d\udc94", "best of luck to you and your husband. you really pulled together here.", "Getting my tubes tied hopefully, looking into it anyways", "I mean, some people took it the way i did. I'm sorry i made that comment under the assumption, but my point stands for anyone else in the comment section that may try to tell her she's wrong and needs to do it. Maybe he won't improve, maybe he will. Immediately leaving everytime someone is a jerk isn't the solution. They have to try to improve before you throw in the towel and it doesn't help that OP is a stay at home mother with no family near by that speaks English or her own. She could try to make friends outside of the home like mommy and baby groups or something so she's not completely alone. I know Britain is also better childcare than the US (i hope, I'm not entirely sure but it can't be much worse) so maybe she could get a job so that if worst comes to worst (heaven forbid) she can leave. But again, this is all her choice and has nothing to do with whether she's an asshole.

Good luck with everything!", "True. It's expensive as heck to try new ones but if it's a food issue it can be all the difference. My daughter was sensitive, not intolerant, of lactose. So she'd eat some regular formula, scream, nap, repeat. Took a while to develop because she got about half breast milk for 6 weeks. \n\n*Fortunately* she had a twin, who at 3 months was happily eating more and more and getting all chubby while she was eating less and less at a time (down to 1 or 2 ounces) and crying a lot and had sad eyes. We were both wrecked. Doctor said could not be the formula and she had a cold. Right. \n\nSo finally it hit both of us, hey, can't hurt to try soy formula. It's just as nutritious! She ate 5 ounces, smiled and I *swear* I could hear her thinking \"Thank God they finally figured THAT out!\"\n\nAt age one she was fine with all regular dairy. Kids. They're tough.", "Hi OP, another thing to consider - maybe your child's lactose intolerant? My nephew was an especially cry-y baby, always up in the night way more than other babies etc. Turns out he's lactose intolerant and basically always in pain, poor little thing. Once that was figured out he became much happier and quieter!  \n\n\nSorry to add to your list of things to investigate, but I hope you get a good outcome soon.", "Thank you, I can\u2019t believe people think it\u2019s an easy fix to just decide to not have a child\u2026.
