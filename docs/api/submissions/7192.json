That was incredibly helpful and also made me feel like it\u2019s not just me and that I\u2019m not alone \u2764\ufe0f thank you! \n\nI also wanted to address the comments saying \u201crun\u201d, \u201cdivorce\u201d and \u201cabortion\u201d. I get that you might think that is helpful but I am pregnant. I don\u2019t think now is the time for mourning the end of a relationship. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the correct time for drudging up trauma either and healing through therapy. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell someone to abort. The same way I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell someone not to. I hope that you respect those decisions. \n\nAs for therapy, I am considering it after the baby is born. That was a take away I did not expect to even be on my mind after posting that. \n\nSo here\u2019s the update,\nI spoke to him using a lot of the advice given to me. We came to an agreement on how to get the house cleaned up and that he needed to take responsibility as a father. We also discussed how being a parent is not a job but rather a role that we much both fulfil. \nWithout you guys I would never have been able to word that the way I wanted to, so thank you. \n\nHe took a day off, watched baby the entire day. I could tell it wasn\u2019t easy because our baby is difficult and clingy, but he didn\u2019t complain at all. The house is now, finally, CLEAN. Not just tidy but actually clean. \n\nI think we needed to work on communication and making each other feel valid on their struggles rather than playing oppression Olympics with each other. Again, sounds like common sense but redditors really helped me to put that into perspective. I\u2019m not innocent here either as the \u201cyta\u201ds and \u201cesh\u201ds ~kindly~ pointed out\n\nThank you for all the Facebook groups and book recommendations too. I will be taking my baby to the doctors (when they finally give me an appointment) and I am going to take every single suggestion to find out if there\u2019s a reason he is not sleeping well. Until then, dad has offered to take one night a week on weekends he is not working. That itself is a huge HUGE weight off my shoulders. \n\nThank you AITA \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1673576400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10aidys/update_aita_for_asking_my_partner_to_take_the/", "score": 668, "replies": ["Congratulations on the improvement!

I support abortion and am pro choice and would drive my daughter to the appt if she requested one with no judgement but I\u2019d also support her if she choose to parent with a worthless baby daddy. \n\nI\u2019d highly recommend op go on birth control or get her tubes tied if she decides to stay with her husband and he doesn\u2019t get any better though.", "Two babies and doing no work to actually fix it.

So this talk of pushing her towards abortion is just serious projection on the part of that commenter above.", "It was judgemental. Leave your judgements at the assholeishness, not a woman's reproductive decisions, unless she asks for your opinion.", "Projection is taking traits/emotions you have and assigning them to someone else.

He also found time for his neighbors and community! He was present so much of the time. Happy, involved... even to this day you don't have to ask him for anything. He knows and if you aren't fast enough he'll beat you to taking care of what needs to be done.\n\nMy mother is the same way. She always says, \"it isn't 50/50...both partners give 100%.\"\n\nLike how tf are these men making babies and acting like they're useless outside of their job? Even when I was a teenager living on my own I worked overtime and came home and took care of cooking, cleaning, errands, etc. It is not that hard. \n\nI hope you keep moving towards a more balanced lifestyle. I'm honestly surprised you haven't completely burnt out yet.", "Happy for you but I still think his offer of stepping up for a possible max of only 4 nights a month is insultingly low.

It won't help with the night sleeping but will keep baby happy and your  hands free during the day. I loved it. And I want to give you a strengthening virtual hug.

It will get better, maybe not tomorrow but it will get better!", "Only one night a week?!", "Good luck, OP!\n\nI had a family member who had a colicky baby.  Which basically just means - a grumpy, fussy, does-not-sleep mess. It is very hard on your mental state and your marriage.  And so so hard to be the parent home with the baby, and to hear your partner dismiss your struggles.  They, of all people, should know what you are dealing with! They got through it with the help of a lot of family and a nanny, and truly the child and the marriage are thriving as they got over the first horrible years (yes, he was a cantankerous toddler, as well).  You are a warrior for doing 95% of this on your own!  \n\nIn case you have not tried these things - they definitely found their baby had a lot of gas.  He was helped with probiotic drops and this little product called the Windi before every bedtime/nap. Definitely did best in a serious swaddle and later Merlin's Magic Sleep Suit. Napped at an angle in the Rock N Play, since discontinued, but there are other similar things out there these days.  And they tried every sleep training method out there.  Ultimately ended up with essentially the Moms on Call method.  If you are seeing a sleep consultant and getting no results - try someone else.  It is definitely true - some babies just don't sleep.  The difference in total sleep time with this child and their later children was truly jaw dropping.  But you should see SOME improvement, and definitely longer stretches than an hour. These consultants are not adapting for your child's needs.  You need someone better.", "He takes the baby every evening but one night a week so I can sleep is the agreement.
