That was incredibly helpful and also made me feel like it\u2019s not just me and that I\u2019m not alone \u2764\ufe0f thank you! \n\nI also wanted to address the comments saying \u201crun\u201d, \u201cdivorce\u201d and \u201cabortion\u201d. I get that you might think that is helpful but I am pregnant. I don\u2019t think now is the time for mourning the end of a relationship. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the correct time for drudging up trauma either and healing through therapy. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell someone to abort. The same way I don\u2019t think it\u2019s appropriate to tell someone not to. I hope that you respect those decisions. \n\nAs for therapy, I am considering it after the baby is born. That was a take away I did not expect to even be on my mind after posting that. \n\nSo here\u2019s the update,\nI spoke to him using a lot of the advice given to me. We came to an agreement on how to get the house cleaned up and that he needed to take responsibility as a father. We also discussed how being a parent is not a job but rather a role that we much both fulfil. \nWithout you guys I would never have been able to word that the way I wanted to, so thank you. \n\nHe took a day off, watched baby the entire day. I could tell it wasn\u2019t easy because our baby is difficult and clingy, but he didn\u2019t complain at all. The house is now, finally, CLEAN. Not just tidy but actually clean. \n\nI think we needed to work on communication and making each other feel valid on their struggles rather than playing oppression Olympics with each other. Again, sounds like common sense but redditors really helped me to put that into perspective. I\u2019m not innocent here either as the \u201cyta\u201ds and \u201cesh\u201ds ~kindly~ pointed out\n\nThank you for all the Facebook groups and book recommendations too. I will be taking my baby to the doctors (when they finally give me an appointment) and I am going to take every single suggestion to find out if there\u2019s a reason he is not sleeping well. Until then, dad has offered to take one night a week on weekends he is not working. That itself is a huge HUGE weight off my shoulders. \n\nThank you AITA \u2764\ufe0f", "created_utc": 1673576400, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10aidys/update_aita_for_asking_my_partner_to_take_the/", "score": 2006, "replies": ["Congratulations on the improvement!

They got through it with the help of a lot of family and a nanny, and truly the child and the marriage are thriving as they got over the first horrible years (yes, he was a cantankerous toddler, as well).  You are a warrior for doing 95% of this on your own!  \n\nIn case you have not tried these things - they definitely found their baby had a lot of gas.

Ultimately ended up with essentially the Moms on Call method.  If you are seeing a sleep consultant and getting no results - try someone else.  It is definitely true - some babies just don't sleep.  The difference in total sleep time with this child and their later children was truly jaw dropping.  But you should see SOME improvement, and definitely longer stretches than an hour.

I could not have managed the evry day tasks without my babybj\u00f6rn baby carrier, I would put it on backwards so I  carried her on my back instead of on my front when I was doing \"stuff\" around the house.\nAnd for the nights I recorded stories from childrens books. I think 3 ore 4 diffrent in a loop so she could hear my voice at night, I put my shirt for the day on a pillow in her bed for my smell and she got a little bit \"heavyer\" formula for the night.

On bad nights they would both sleep in until late, it was tough leaving the house with them both sleeping peacefully. \n\nAs to the cleaning, all i can say is for you both to do little bits here and there to try and stop it becoming a massive mess.

My first question was about her diet. Yeah she was trying to lose the baby weight while also breastfeeding... I told her either switch to formula or take in enough nutrition to feed him. You can't have it both ways.\n\nOP, I know you aren't purposely on a diet but if you aren't eating well your baby (both of them, actually) isn't eating well either. Not having proper nutrition hurts all three of you. I'm not saying it to shame or accuse, but I'm an attempt to help. Set timers for eating if you have to, have snacks on hand that you can have without much effort. Like cheese sticks, those packs that are tuna and crackers, nuts, trail mix, yogurt, anything with protein. And enough veggies at meals to make sure of that aspect too, but your protein intake is a big one while breastfeeding or pregnant. Oh, also chicken broth and crackers if you literally can't stomach stuff because of the pregnancy. I found some bone broth on Amazon that has tumeric and ginger. Ginger is one of the best things for seeking the stomach there is, for many people it works even better than prescriptions!\n\nDuring my pregnancy I often went without eating because I don't always feel hunger and I was queasy literally from about five weeks in until I gave birth. That's how I found out, actually, I thought I had the flu or something so went to the doctor to get a note for work. Nope, pregnant. And I developed severe blood sugar issues because I wasn't eating regularly.

An abuser for the first. And the first one acted like your husband.\n\nIf he doesn't want to look like an abuser, he should deal with his emotional stuff that prevents him from taking on 100% of the responsibility. That is what couples therapy is for. \n\nBecause that's what most adult partners do. They both take 100% responsibility for their home and family.\n\nYou already know it is possible: you're already doing that. You see it needing to be done, you want to deal with it.\n\nI live in a country where therapy is not an everyday thing, not like the US makes it seem like.\n\nI don't know a single long term relationship or marriage in my surroundings that has gone without couples therapy at one or several points. They usually only mention it once you mention you are thinking about/doing it yourselves.\n\nApart from the 70+ year olds.\n\nAlso, its less tiring in a home where you've got 1 adult and kids, than the same but also 1 antagonistic, unhelpful \"teenager\" that only does as he's told once you have stern talks all the time.\n\nHe might have \"mom zoned\" you. Not as the mother of his kids, but acting as if your *his* mother. Acting like he's your slightly incompetent teenage son. That will only do things once you command him.

A bad diet with only affect mum, as the body will always prioritise making milk.\n\nI'm sorry, but this is NOT true! A bad diet will affect the mother AND the milk! What do you think the milk is made of? If the mother is deficient in nutrients, the milk can't contain nutrients the mother doesn't have. The body doesn't work that way! The body can only produce based on what it is given & on what it can make from what it is given. It is extremely important for nursing mothers to pay attention to what they eat and to their baby's feeding. If the child is not thriving or having difficulty eating, which does happen, they need to move to formula. Giving a baby breast milk isn't going to make the baby a brain surgeon, a successful lawyer or a billionaire any more than formula feeding will, and we have to get out of the mindset of telling new mothers that breast milk is the only way. It is not! In addition to vitamin & mineral deficiencies, there are many diseases that a mother can pass to their child through breast milk!

Make sure to clean any blocked nose of mucus. Give 3 main meals every 3 hours (at 12-13, 15-16 & 18-19) and for the last one make porridge. Give a bath daily to calm the baby. Try to make a food and sleep schedule and stick to it. Give egg 4 times a week. Make sure baby\u2019s tummy isn\u2019t hard (poops regularly). If she refuses to eat solids, take food away after 20min of trying and check the signs of what is bothering her (nappy, tummy, sleepy, pain, not liking food, etc). See if she wants to breastfeed and try again solids after 1h. Offer water during meals.\n\nFor me, their advices work 80% of the time but we\u2019re most of the time behind schedule..There are days she eats her porridge at 1am or 3am in the morning because she\u2019s moody during the day and refuses meals but we stick to the main meal every 3h plan..3 meals a day become 4 or 5 as she stays awake more into the night but we get there..\n\nIt\u2019s always breastfeeding-food-breastfeeding-sleep.

Sometimes she wakes up during the process and we start again..\n\nMy issue was that I didn\u2019t have enough breast milk so I started giving my baby more food during the day. I always give her snacks while I prepare the food and while I clean the kitchen & dining area after meals. One eye on the baby while she sits on the table and one on cleaning. I always clean her booster seat last and move her in the ball pit or bouncer for the 5-10min I clean it. Sometimes she gets to see Ms Rachel/ Sparkabilities/ Sesame Street while I run upstairs to get some clothes to put in the washing machine and clean the cats area. My plan was no TV before 1h but I failed miserably when she was 4-5 months because I needed time to cook& clean and she got 10min-1h/day of TV.
