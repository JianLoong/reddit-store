If my partner wanted to interrupt my alone time when I am reading at a coffee shop (I, too, love the ambiance of coffee smell and a nice book, especially in a comfy seat by a window for lots of light) when we're going to be home together later, I would probably end up saying something I would regret later that hurts their feelings a lot more than \"I don't want you to come with me.\" \n\nThat's just such an odd level of codependency to feel the need to be with one's partner for the few hours they are relaxing alone somewhere, and especially trying to make conversation and interrupt their alone time. \n\nSolid NTA.", "NTA.

And then ask me what was wrong when I didn't respond.\n\nI found two solutions:\n\n1.)  Go outside and sit in my vehicle to eat my lunch and read in peace.\n\n2.) I put a sign on one table that said \"Quiet table for readers.
