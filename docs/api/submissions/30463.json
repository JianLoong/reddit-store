Don't let her guilt trip you anymore.", "In my opinion her expectations are insane, but all things considered still expecting her family to reach out about a boyfriend that passed away when she was 17 years old after so many years hint of a deeper mental health issue.\n\nYou are definitely not an asshole for not wanting to continue this insanity but it sounds like that \"just speaking\" to your sister is not going to solve the problem and you will have to rely on an indirect approach to get rid of those expectations.\n\nMaybe support her somehow in looking for a therapist. The real issue is that she needs some kind of help to both move on from what happened and to not rely on anything she can hold on to to receive attention.", "Of course NTA. Goodness we don\u2019t even commemorate my late wife\u2019s b\u2019day and we were married for a long time.   What I suspect is happening your sister is trying to recapture, wallow and even enjoy the attention and feelings from when it first happened.", "Her poor partner.

Doesn't mean she needs to forget the BF, but it's time to quit flailing herself and everyone around her.", "NTA, that happened 13 years ago and even if she has all the right to still mourn, it\u2019s not fair she wants the others mourn, too. You have the right to chose whatever is good for your mental health, and this doesn\u2019t sound very healthy (not even for her).", "NTA\n\nTell her the 5G chip from the vaccine has taken you over and there's no point in her arguing with it.", "NTA- if she wants to remember him, thats on her to do so, she can't expect everyone else to drop everything to pander to her needs on set days.  13 years, wow, maybe she needs to get some therapy. Yes loosing someone sucks, supporting them for some years afterwards ok but there has to come a time when people move on.", "NTA.  Let her know that while you are sorry for the loss of her boyfriend, you are past the grief stage and will be moving on with your life.  This person was not family, just someone she was dating.  Your sister may need therapy if she hasn't moved on after 13 years.", "NTA. Your sister's grieving is up to her. She doesn't get to dictate how the rest of you treat these days.", "NTA\n\nLosing someone precious to you is indeed something you would grieve over, but 13 years?

I'm just wondering why your sister let him stop, but when it comes to you, I quote:\n\n>\"the wrong time,\" and I would be scolded, leaving me walking on eggshells.\n\nSo, it is very likely that she is an attention seeker who burdens you mentally as well.\n\nAnd to be frank, someone who got into a new relationship is most of the time over his/her old one because that kind of a relationship ends in my eyes rarely with all smiles and laughs.\n\nFazit: Tell your sister to stop forcing her \"grief\" on to others with the reasons that it is unfair and weird to her new bf AND that if she if she is truly that sad still after 13 years that she should start seeing a therapist or another expert.\n\nPs: English is neither my first nor 2nd language", "Of course you're NTA and it's ridiculous that you and your mom are allowing your sister to hold you hostage to her ridiculous drama.

For many grief never goes away and they need to honor the people they lost but you cannot force others to do so with you.  If she's still so touchy about this she needs help not enabling.", "Nahh that's just dumb. Grieving over a teenage crush for 13 whole ass years is wild.

She can either grow up and live life or she can continue to throw herself a pity party which no one else has to participate in.", "Tell her that for the sake of your mental health, your spiritual counselor has advised you to commemorate the anniversary only with a period of silent reflection as naming the dead is disruptive to them in the afterlife.

But how you proceed depends on what kind of relationship, if any, you want with your sister. \n\nThis sounds like a hard boundary for her.

You don't need to do more than that IMO.\n\nHowever, due to the manipulation, name-calling, toxicity you've experienced from your sister, you're fine to drop the rope and stop trying.

If she needs to grieve that is her decision.  The world does not stop spinning. Others, unfortunately, will move on from a death if it did not impact them as much.

She's now THIRTY YEARS OLD and wants *other people* to reach out to commemorate his birthday?? Seriously,  that's fucking insane and I feel really bad for her new bf because you just can't compete with dead people. \n\nYour sister needs help, and I personally don't feel that feeding into this unnatural obsession is helping. If she wants to recognize the day on her own in some way as a way of honoring his memory, I still think that's excessive for a high school relationship, but it's not egregious. Expecting other people to mourn with her is just making this dude's death about her.", "It\u2019s too much. I\u2019m fatigued at people who make everyone\u2019s death about themselves for attention. I recognize this situation is a bit different since it\u2019s just one person\u2019s death, but I\u2019d say OP is NTA.
