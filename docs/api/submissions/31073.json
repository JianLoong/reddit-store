The answer to not dealing with criminal consequences is not doing crime, not just doing it to family. But we've created \"safe\" people to do crime to, because we make people feel guilty about being honest about what happened and taking the appropriate steps. The problem with \"dealing with it in the family\" is that families often *don't know* what to do about it and just sweep it under the rug. They just keep sweeping and sweeping until the person commits a crime against the wrong person and it's taken out of the family's hands. Super sucks, especially for the people in the family that are expected to suck it up. \n\nHowever, I'm not actually disagreeing with you. I wouldn't do it to my own niece (not that I'd let it go without her getting a big a$$ piece of mind) and in this particular case she's clearly going through some things. Besides that the alternative is actually highly ineffective and just not a very good system for the complexity of society or the humans in it. They don't actually *solve* problems, they just separate them from society. So we're just kind of stuck with dealing with the consequences of \"keeping it in the family\" so that the youngest and dumbest of us don't face consequences that do more harm than good to them. OP *should* be able to call for help when his car is missing with the assurance that when they found niece she'd get the proper \"help\". Whether that help was mental healthwise, programs and resources, or even consequences that both fit the crime and her personal situation so that she actually learns and grows from it. That's unfortunately not the world we live in so we have to just cross our fingers and hope that families do their best to redirect the youth on their own knowing their best will most likely not be good enough to save the most docile of us from being taken advantage of in the name of \"family\". Just lamenting on how much that sucks. \n\nWhat this kid needs is therapy, not just a change of scenery. She's acting out because EVERYTHING is changing and it is extremely hard to adjust when you're still learning how to be a person. She's obviously overwhelmed emotionally and needs more help than just avoiding their fighting. Children are so dependent on their parents from the very beginning and are typically used to the idea that their family is their team, but when that \"team\" breaks up and separates, even if you're still in contact with all the members, there is grief. Our immediate family is the first group that we assimilate with and take on as part of our identity, so it's extra difficult and can often spiral into an identity crisis. She needs therapy and consequences for stealing OP's car so she doesn't go off and make other bad choices like drinking before she gets behind the wheel of the car she stole. It's how parents can prove that they *are* still there to help their kids become better people, despite the divorce, and keep their kids grounded (not like the punishment, like grounded to the Earth) so they don't spiral out of control because that's how they're feeling; fragmented and out of control. Honestly, your child's therapy is just part of the cost of a divorce.", "Oh 100. I\u2019ll never understand the thought process behind sending your kid away when things get rough (whether it\u2019s them or within the family), when the fact is that they need to know their parents love them and will be there to support them during that time more than ever.", "But they\u2019re not just getting a divorce, they\u2019re getting a divorce and sent her away.

You are saying OP is completely absolved of all responsibility for participating in such an arrangement because \u201csomeone else would have,\u201d as if nothing can possibly be irresponsible or immoral to actively choose to participate in as long as you think someone might have possibly eventually done that same thing. That tells me you have literally no concept of personal accountability and feel no responsibility to act ethically for the sake of being an ethical person.
