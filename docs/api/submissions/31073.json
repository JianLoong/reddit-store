She stole your car and he's mad with you? That's crazy talk. \n\nIt's a fair bet that your niece is acting out because her homelife is a shitshow thanks to her parents. This is all on them. He should be apologizing, not yelling at you.", "NTA. I get that divorce is hard, but it isn\u2019t an excuse to dump your child on someone else, especially if that child is a belligerent teenager.", "Nta\nShe has very simple and very lenient rules to follow. Stealing your car and the acting unapologetic is not okay. You are right to put your foot down because this probably would've happened again otherwise if you let her stay.", "NTA  You could've called the police for a stolen car. He should be grateful you didn't.", "Your brother (and, even more so, your niece) should be VERY grateful that you didn't report the car stolen, and that she wasn't in jail for grand theft! Just having to drive an hour to pick up his daughter is pretty small potatoes by comparison.  \n\nNTA", "NTA- you told her the rules and she broke them. Actions have consequences and this young adult is not your responsibility.", "Look, she's not handling this divorce well and she needs someone to help her.  But just because she needs it doesn't mean that the person needs to be you.  Hopefully her parents will realize that whether or not she is a front row witness or not, this divorce is hitting her hard (I am assuming that she is not an unpleasant child).\n\nNTA but please encourage her parents to find her some help", "Clearly NTA. She stole a car, thats a dealbreaker in anyone's book. Niece needs more supervision than you can give her. \"Hot Stove\" techniques that give instant consequences for bad actions is a great way to teach people not to behave badly. You did the right thing.", "NTA, that was extremely simple rules and she\u2019s not your kid so why be disrespected in your own home if you don\u2019t have to be?", "Nta", "NTA. It makes sense why she is so unrepentant with dad as a parent.", "NTA He and his ungrateful brat of a daughter should be grateful you didn\u2018t report the car as stolen", "NTA - You parented for the parents. Actions have consequences and your niece just learned this.", "NTA.  Tell him the other option is reporting it stolen and he can pick her up from the police station.", "Nta niece fooled around and found out. You've been doing your brother a favor and he has no business complaining.", "You should have called the police, teach her a lesson. No one else seems to be trying to teach her anything", "NTA but instead of calling her father to come get her you should have called the police and reported her for stealing your car. She sounds like she needs a good kick in the ass to understand that there are consequences to what you do in life that you aren't supposed to. You also had no idea where she was or what she was doing with your car. If it was anything illegal they could have come after you for it.", "NTA. I feel for the kid because she\u2019s already pulling bullshit over the divorce, but you\u2019re by no means a victim she can take advantage of. Your brother is an asshole. You tried to help, she took advantage of it? She can reap what she sows.", "I'm going with ESH.\n\nSounds like nobody gives a shit about that girl.", "ESH! I feel like everyone could be doing a better job to support this (?) teen. All you gave her were some rules. The way you\u2019ve worded these sounds like you don\u2019t care unless she breaks them? Her parents don\u2019t seem to want to parent her. And she did something irresponsible and dangerous. \n\nOkay, she\u2019s difficult. It sounds like she is going through something painful. Her brain isn\u2019t fully developed yet so I\u2019m wondering if anyone is gonna step up and parent her, including holding her to account and get her into therapy?!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
