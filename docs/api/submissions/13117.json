Good for you, being accepting of your gf and defending her.", "NTA. \n\nAnd good on you for standing up for your fianc\u00e9e! A and B honestly sound like friends you guys should start pulling back from. To ask for reimbursement is absurd and beyond entitled. \n\nEvery time my fianc\u00e9 and I travel somewhere with a heavy stray population, I always set aside at least half a day to spend with a local shelter. Is it my fianc\u00e9s cup of tea? Nope. Does he still come with me? Absolutely. And if we are ever traveling with others, they know to go on with their plans and we will meet up with them later.

There might be opportunities in your area where she could actually make a big difference in the lives of cats. \n\nTNR doesn't require much, but it can really help with feral cat populations. Fostering is also an option, shelters always need volunteers to take on caring for kittens until they're old enough to be adopted. \n\nYou both have 4 cats together, so she can rest well knowing she's already making the lives of them so much more wonderful by being with you! \n\nBest wishes to you and your fianc\u00e9e!", "NTA - I can't believe they went as far as to say that she ruined their evening by being an empathetic person.

Would they have been the same way? (Probably)", "NTA\nyou\u2019re a keeper.", "NTA. You behaved like I think a good husband should and your wife seems like an amazing person to feel such compassion for an animal. Most people can't feel this much compassion for animals. Maybe one day, when both you two are old and have the money you can start a shelter or something together. Sounds like that is her ultimate dream. Only if you're up for it of course. \n\nJust want to close off with saying that I think the world needs more people like you and your wife. We need more people with your level of empathy and compassion for how others (including animals) feel.", "Based on what is in the post, NTA, but I feel like some \"unimportant details\" may have been skipped. Based on what OP presented, there is no reasonable way that A and B should feel like they are due a reimbursement. The fact that they asked makes me think something more happened.\n\nBut based only on the post presented, definitely not the AH for defending your GF. Don't ask about if you are the AH for leaving GF alone in the street for an hour in an unfamiliar country where she doesn't speak the language.", "I'd have been the same as your fiancee,  NTA you are a good guy", "NTA at all. You're a good fiance. If this happened to us my fiance would probably do the same(and tbh, so would i- were both cat lovers) so i feel you guys. Thank you for being a good partner in this situation.", "Absolutely NTA. But it\u2019s the reimbursement of the days activities that utterly guts me. Like sure I\u2019m sensitive to peoples emotions and if they\u2019re not having fun I can feel a little down too. But she clearly had reason to be sad. And they decided it was her fault they didn\u2019t have fun? AND want their money back? Wtf dude?", "[removed]", "Cats will poo in your yard even if you have a fence. In winter they have dinged car engine hoods by hanging out on them. Their pee smells. I\u2019m just giving you reasons. I like cats, hanging out with a little devil atm and she is probably the only reason I have not quit my job yet.", "Damn those stray cars, always stealing my heart as well, wish I could take them home but don\u2019t have the garage space :(", "Yup the cat was doing what a cat wants lol", "It is a rabies free country, but it did visibly have fleas. She didn\u2019t touch it for that reason. The cat basically just wanted to sit a foot away from her for an hour. It was quite timid.", "I've always found frustrating people hate cats for... Being animals,like yeah most animal pee smells, and they don't understand fences or cars either\n\nBut people seem to expect cats to know somehow and act as if they were doing these things out of hate", "They puke and/or have hairballs on everything. I wouldn't trade my three though.", "None of those things would be an issue if people kept their fucking cats inside as they should", "My sister\u2019s like this (and I would be too if I ever went anywhere \ud83d\ude05). Trip to Fiji? Plays with cats. Austria? Cats. Greece? Cats. Istanbul? *Lots* of cats. It\u2019s very much her superpower!", "Same. The way they sit at your feet with their headlights wide, waiting for the tiniest scrap. Saw a super-skinny minivan a couple of days ago with six scruffy little compacts to feed. Heartbreaking.", " \nI am the same and have also adopted some stray cats.", "Can my husband and I join too. We've always said if we had the funds and land, we would open a cat sanctuary.\n\nOP NTA", "If your cats are throwing up frequently that\u2019s not normal and you should see a vet. If they\u2019re throwing up hairballs frequently, you need to be brushing them more often to get off the loose hairs.", "In some places around the world there\u2019s established feral cat populations or even landrace cat breeds that are native fauna to the area. Not every culture & place sees cats as housecats and/or invasive species to be kept indoors.", "Same lol told my husband I want to get a farm to have cats live in it lol but of course you can definitely join the e-harmony cat lady gang lol", "Those cats aren't pets, though, are they? By definition."]}
