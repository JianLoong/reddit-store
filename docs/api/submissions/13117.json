She didn't hurt them or screw that trip up.  I'm glad you told them to fuck off.  Big ol' NTA. I love cats too, and it's heartbreaking to love cats, 'cause a lot of people hate them for no reason and go out of their way to hurt them.  Good for you, being accepting of your gf and defending her.", "NTA. \n\nAnd good on you for standing up for your fianc\u00e9e! A and B honestly sound like friends you guys should start pulling back from. To ask for reimbursement is absurd and beyond entitled. \n\nEvery time my fianc\u00e9 and I travel somewhere with a heavy stray population, I always set aside at least half a day to spend with a local shelter. Is it my fianc\u00e9s cup of tea? Nope. Does he still come with me? Absolutely. And if we are ever traveling with others, they know to go on with their plans and we will meet up with them later. They may not understand why I do that, but even if they don\u2019t agree with it, they respect it. \n\nYour fianc\u00e9e sounds like a woman who embodies \u201cloving animals isn\u2019t what I do, it\u2019s who I am.\u201d It shows how big her heart truly is.", "NTA - thank you, thank you, THANK YOU for sticking up for your so! Based on what you\u2019ve described, she was simply a lil bummed for the day, but didn\u2019t disturb the flow of the trip/cancel any kind of outing which would maybe necessitate the need for a refund. \n\nA and B are weird as hell for this.\nGood on you, op!", "NTA.  I was somewhat sympathetic to A+B until they said she ruined their day and *asked for reimbursement.* Those two are definitely assholes.  Wow.", "LMAO they asked to be reimbursed??!?!? NTA", "NTA\nNot understanding your fianc\u00e9e would be one thing, asking friends for money because trip didn\u2019t turn out that well is something completely different \nThat was pretty shitty behavior from A & B", "NTA. Nobody asked them to stay with her, in fact she let them go explore or do whatever.", "NTA. A and B are huge jerks for requesting you to pay them. I they don't like how your fiance acts, they shouldn't go on a vacation with her. One slightly blemished day from unexpected eccentric actions is what you sign up for when you go on vacation with other people. Good of you to cancel the plans.", "NTA, your fianc\u00e9e has a good heart, I can understand the friends being a bit annoyed, but honestly it seems like their trip wasn't that affected and I'd probably make a similar detour if I found a stray cat. \n\nI'm sure someone will/has mentioned it, but I actually have a similar dream myself to take on strays or elderly animals out on a big ranch one day. There might be opportunities in your area where she could actually make a big difference in the lives of cats. \n\nTNR doesn't require much, but it can really help with feral cat populations. Fostering is also an option, shelters always need volunteers to take on caring for kittens until they're old enough to be adopted. \n\nYou both have 4 cats together, so she can rest well knowing she's already making the lives of them so much more wonderful by being with you! \n\nBest wishes to you and your fianc\u00e9e!", "NTA - I can't believe they went as far as to say that she ruined their evening by being an empathetic person. What a bunch of assholes.", "You\u2019re the perfect man for her\u2763\ufe0f", "NTA. They are. I would\u2019ve cried too!! Poor kitty :(. But seriously, kudos to you for defending your fianc\u00e9e, she did nothing wrong & you should absolutely not pay for the tickets. What jerks.", "NTA.\n\nShe \"ruined their day\". Give me a break. Even if she did ruin their day, which I don't believe for a second (at worst a minor inconvenience), why the hell are they asking for money? Why does that even enter their heads?\n\nYour reaction was appropriate. Good for you and your fianc\u00e9e.", "NTA.  Your friends sound like huge AHs.  She took 15 minutes of their time and then encouraged them to continue exploring.  The request for ticket reimbursement was outrageous!", ">Not one sleeps on me.\n\nDon't beat yourself up about it, you're a good step dad. 10/10\n\nNTA (and the only right way in this scenario)", "\\>Ultimately there was nothing she could do for this poor cat\u2014we didn\u2019t speak the language at all\n\nMeow?  \n\n\nShe was being a huge bummer about the cat. There's nothing you can do so why dwell on it? I'm sure she did ruin their day but I'm not sure you should reimburse them.  \n\n\nVerdict: ESH. Find friends who won't care if your gf suddenly gets in a mood and starts crying over something that is very common to see.", "She was very apologetic. Offered to catch an earlier train back to the hotel. They insisted she stay and enjoy the rest of our activities (which she probably didn\u2019t)", "That\u2019s a great idea. The language barrier can be intimidating but I\u2019ll suggest this to her.", "We did every activity in the area that we\u2019d planned on doing. After the cat incident, fianc\u00e9e sat outside for most of them. However it\u2019s not like we shortened any activity\u2014ultimately we caught the evening train we booked with 5 minutes to spare, so our day was well-spent imo.", "The language of the people you dumb fuck", "and if that\u2019s how your fianc\u00e9e wanted to spend the time then that is well within their right! A and B are doing some serious mental gymnastics to justify needing the day refunded.\n\nI commend you once again for sticking up for your SO and I wish you both all the best!", "NTA. Wtf they asked you to reimburse them because your fianc\u00e9 has a big heart? They could have done their own thing if it bummed them out so much. Glad you have her back. They\u2019re TA.", "NTA", "NTA. I feel that way about dogs. I went to Bali not even thinking about the strays. As beautiful as it was, seeing all those dogs that I could do absolutely nothing for just ruined the trip. It\u2019s really hard to see so many suffering.", "I\u2019d drop these people immediately.", "NTA. I don\u2019t see anything AH about this. I\u2019d do the same thing. And asking for reimbursement is bizarre and petty. You two should rethink your friendship with A and B.", "NTA and good for you for doing what a partner should and supporting your gf. Your friends on the other hand need to loosen up.", "Marry that girl.", "Thanks to you for defending your fiance and to your fiance for loving cats.  Felines need all the allies they can get!!  NTA", "Nta. You rock, don't ever change", "NAH. You\u2019re great for defending your SO. That being said, it would be a bummer to go on a trip only to have one person crying and moping about a cat", "NTA..\n\nYour friends A and B however\u2026 two big A\u2019s\u2026\n\nYou did so right by your fianc\u00e9e and bravo to you and her. It must have been so rough for her to ultimately say goodbye to that stray cat.. \ud83d\udc94\n\nAnd good on you as well for telling A and B what they could do with reimbursement. Screw them, and you and your wonderful fianc\u00e9e be happy together and continue to love all the kittehs! \ud83d\udc96", "NTA. I would marry someone like you. I too have a soft spot for cats. Thank you so much for defending her", "When my husband and I got married, it was outside at my in-laws beach house. Mid- ceremony, at cat showed up, walked right up to me and started meowing. You can bet I stopped to pet the cat, and literally noone was surprised, or mad. My husband, my family and his family all know how I feel about cats. We have tons of photos with said cat in them.\n\nNTA but your friends definitely are.", "NTA. I love that you had your fianc\u00e9e\u2019s back. You supported her in absolutely every way you could and should.\n\nI think it\u2019s lovely that she has such a big heart, and it\u2019s wonderful that you obviously love that about her. \n\nYou have not done a thing wrong. She\u2019s lucky to have you.", "NTA. I am 100% like your fianc\u00e9e. I\u2019ve had to leave cats like that too and it breaks my heart every time. A and B are rude and I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll ever be able to get them to see your side.", "NTA. You're going to be a great husband!", "See while I do love cats I don\u2019t have any I have three dogs though and they are my world and honestly seeing stray animals breaks my heart every time I just don\u2019t understand how people can see an animal like that and not want to help. That\u2019s why part of me is worried about traveling cause I know I would want to take in all the strays but I don\u2019t have the time energy or money for that", "NTA. Your fiancee sounds like a cupcake and if you hurt her I'll hurt you. World needs more of her and you and less of your 'friends'.", "The audacity of these sociopaths"]}
