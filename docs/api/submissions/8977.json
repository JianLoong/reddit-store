We live about a half hour apart and see each other for dinner once a month.\n\nRecently I was at his house and one of the kids says they (the family) have lice. I had already been hugging and wrestling with these kids, and sitting on their furniture. I immediately got up and started touching my hair, and felt super gross. I asked my bro and SIL if they knew about this. They kind of laughed it off like yeah we have lice, had it for a week or so, we are shampooing and cleaning and stuff, no big deal.\n\nI know lice is a common problem. Kids get it. Shit happens. So I 100% understand that it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault that the lice were there in the first place. So after eating (and trying to keep a distance), I went home, and shampooed and combed my hair for weeks. I read online that the lice can take weeks to show symptoms. I felt phantom itchiness all the time, thinking about bugs in my hair or bed. It was hard to sleep sometimes. Thankfully I seem to be in the clear. \n\nHowever\u2026. I was not happy that no one told me about this beforehand. Like I wouldn\u2019t have gone over that night or hugged anyone if I had known. I feel like I wasn\u2019t given a chance to make the best choice for me. I feel like they brushed it off like no big deal but\u2026 lice are a pain in the ass and can be hard to get rid of. I also work at a nursing home and could\u2019ve unknowingly caught the lice from my family and been spreading them to my patients. I only found out cuz my nephew mentioned it.\n\nAlso I\u2019d be just as annoyed if it had been any sickness or infestation or whatever bug/virus. It\u2019s the fact that they knowingly exposed me to *anything* and that they brushed it off that bugs me (pun not intended).\n\nMy brother texted me to invite me over for dinner this weekend. I told him I was not happy that he and my SIL hadn\u2019t told me about the bugs beforehand. I also said I felt disrespected by their reaction and that I didn\u2019t want to do dinner this month cuz I just wanted some space but I\u2019d see them next time. I was annoyed but not like super pissed or anything.\n\nBoth brother and SIL come at me (via text) saying that I\u2019m being ridiculous, kids will be kids and will get lice, they aren\u2019t bad parents, they are so busy and stressed raising 4 school age kids, I\u2019m punishing them all by being mad, and lice isn\u2019t a big deal. Now they\u2019re really mad at me and they don\u2019t want to see me for a while.\n\nI haven\u2019t responded yet.

NO WAY SHOULD LICE BE BRUSHED (sorry for the pun) OFF. If you had bedbugs at your home would they want to know?! Unbelievable attitude they have.

So disrespectful, they absolutely needed to inform you that you they had a current outbreak!!! **Rule one of an outbreak/infestation is don\u2019t actively let others catch it!!! ** I can\u2019t believe he and SIL are doubling down like this. There are bugs in every single home on the planet, but there are levels. I had a moth infestation once, but I still had people over because they were concentrated in one place and they\u2019re going to infest every they comes in the house. Anything that lives on your body is a different class of pest. Had you gotten lice from them, you may have had legal grounds to sue them for knowingly exposing you. I\u2019m not saying to actually sue them, rather illustrating that this isn\u2019t just some silly thing.

That they reacted so poorly to you taking some space is super asshole behavior.", "NTA.

Lice is a nasty infestation that can cause diseases. I am getting phatom itches writing this.

Kids steered clear of me for the next month. But me as I FIVE YEAR OLD comprehended this and that it was most likely their parents who told them to do it, and I didnt want anyone to go through the lice issue.\n\nJokingly tell all of your close family whenever given the chance, they probaly won\u00b4t want it either and will also stay clear. When asked by your brother, tell him it just came up in convo, and you thought they didnt think it was that deep.\n\nGET CHECKED NOW", "NTA. It\u2019s pretty rude to not tell people they have lice as a family. It isn\u2019t your fault they are stressed with four school-aged kids.

Not for lice ofc but this is so similar to a large number of people who have bedbugs who wonder why they keep getting bedbugs. I find out they are having people over & not informing their visitors. So visitor leaves not knowing they too will now have bedbugs. Same person visits again probably not yet knowing they have bedbugs, reintroducing it back into ground 0. I understand u don't want people to know but don't have them over & don't go visit others until the infestation is 100% gone.

Your family is demonstrating this ridiculous, self-centered myopia that about 60 \\~90% (?) of humans seem to have: \"I'm not contagious\". It is utter nonsensical blindness and refusal to live considerately. You see it in people who are sick and insist on going into groups coughing with their mouths open. It's also the same psychology of people who believe that their spoiled children running rampant destroying things is adorable, or people who believe their vicious-breed dog would never hurt anything and deserves to be off leash. I'm not sure if the psychological acrobatics are \"Everything about me is wonderful and would never hurt anyone\" or \"If I'm suffering everyone else deserves to suffer too.\"  Or maybe it's the human version of marking territory by peeing on a tree: I marked this space.\n\nReminds me of a substitute nurse we had recently as the whole staff were out sick with Cov. Substitute gets sent in via a staffing agency, and is sitting in the staff meeting coughing with no mask. One of the doctors asks him if he tested himself.  No.  And this guy was going into all the patient rooms already.

It was insane how contagious it was.\n\nI was sick for a solid 3 weeks, I took multiple Covid tests because I had such bad respiratory symptoms.

If you\u2019re around kids of preschool or elementary age a lot, I\u2019m also pretty sure you\u2019ve also been around kids in the process of being treated for lice and not known it (or gotten it). \n\nMaybe it\u2019s just because I am currently in the middle of that exact crowd that it really doesn\u2019t seem like pertinent info to me. I regularly find out after the fact that kids around me have had lice, and the one time we got it was when his friend had it, but didn\u2019t know yet, and his mom let me knew that they\u2019d been playing before she treated him. All those other dozens of kids who mine were around for weeks while being treated? Plus the ones I never knew about? No lice."]}
