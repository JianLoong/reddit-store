I'm not going to let you use my life to express dissatisfaction with yours.\"  You should tell your brother that it's a pity he is involving himself but that he is in charge of his own decisions (i.e., don't let him manipulate you by threatening not to come so you'll beg him to change his mind).\n\nHOWEVER, this kind of dynamic does not develop by magic.  She must have reason to have issues.  Maybe it's not even your fault.  Do your parents treat her badly?  Are you the favorite?  Are you \"the smart one\" or \"the pretty one\" or whatever, while she is constantly put down?  Did your parents help you more when you were at school?  The reason I'm suspicious is that your brother isn't coming to the party either and you've provided no detail.

Hell I\u2019d even go LC at minimum with her and anyone who enables her.
