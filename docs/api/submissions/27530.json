My grandfather still has one of hers on his fridge.", "NTA\n\nI see a lot of folks questioning the source of the dynamics between you and your sister. I'd like to offer you some support.\n\n1. Many of the comments suggesting you MUST have done something or know why she is so jealous are from people who also mention being overshadowed by or not as favored as another sibling. You have responded (1) she's been that way since she was little and (2) that you will try to look at the situation again to see if you've missed something. That sounds like a person who IS trying to understand.\n2. People are also assuming that because your brother has a good relationship and supports your sister, the problem MUST be you. Once your sister made you the scapegoat for all her feelings of inadequacy, she may have never needed to take anything out on your brother. In fact, she may have even been extra nice to him and made an extra effort with him, as if it were the two of them against this mean, show-off sister. He didn't personally experience it, so he's OK with you. But he soaked in his biggest sister's victimness and is protective of her. ALL OF THAT IS SUPPOSITION. But it also just as possible an explanation for the dynamic as the ones that assume you are the problem.\n3. Your parents saw a problem and tried to get help for your sister. Although they spent many years catering to sister's feelings (making clear that you were/are not the favored child), the recognized the wrongness of sister vehemence after she trashed your room. They have clearly struggled as parents, but they did not make you the 'golden child'.\n4. There are plenty of posts about siblings/step-siblings who are just unwelcoming or even mean to a poster. Even when the parents try to address it, it doesn't change. Unless the poster has done something unkind to begin with (and I don't mean merely existing or being a little more successful at something), the support is usually for the person who experienced the meanness. Sure, a few posters actually did do something unkind and gloss over that fact, but it's not generally the default assumption (and shouldn't be).\n5. Here is the biggie. NONE of those suppositions that put any responsibility on you are enough to justify (1) her trashing your room back in your college days or (2) instigating a fight because you are living your life and having a (horror!) house-warming party. Why should you welcome someone into your home who has nothing but insults for you and is the one who makes everything you do about her? You didn't ask your parents to bar her from family gatherings. **You just don't want her to come into your home to be rude to you. On any other post, commenters would be tripping over themselves to support that. It's true here, too.**", "NTA, just because you share blood doesn't mean you have to take her shit, unless she apologizes and change don't waste a second of your life on her.", "Has OP been the golden child, and sister the scapegoat?\n\nCan't give a judgement.  Too much missing.", "NTA. Sounds like your sister is self-centered or has a terminal case of Main Character Syndrome. Block her and enjoy your new house!

You're welcome!\"", "NTA tell your brother that he can go sit with the jealous sister and stay out of your life.", "NTA. Though getting in a huge argument is just letting her push your buttons. Try to just calmly shut her down and hang up.  \nAs for your brother, I don't know what his issue is. Probably best to just ignore him. Definitely don't get in an argument with him! These people (except your parents) seem like huge energy drains.", "I think some people are looking for more then there is.\nMy own bio sister (near ten years older) has always been jealous of me. There are a few things I get, eg; bio parents were in a better financial position by the time I came around. But even as a kid, I was better at saving (I\u2019d organise my own fundraising programs with candy companies and go hard so could pay for school trips, and if I had anything left over I\u2019d have spending money or could buy something cool (eg in 7th grade- I raised $2000 on my own. School trip was $1000, bought myself a camera with the extra which I could get duty free\u2026 my sister was at uni then- pissed. Parents didn\u2019t get her a camera (then or when she was - however old you are in 7th grade). Led to jealous tirade\u2026 \n\nShit continued, to BF, house etc and how dare I not do anything and everything she suggests\u2026 she used to try and give me advice for work\u2026 it was all terrible. I got promotions, better jobs, she\u2019s spiteful. \n\nWe both were kicked out of home before we were done with school, I wasn\u2019t a favourite, parents were alcoholic and physically and emotionally abusive.\n\nShe\u2019s still a POS, compulsively lies, tries to manipulate with her kids and just berates me when she feels like it.  In my opinion she\u2019s always made poor decisions and wants me to be someone I\u2019m not to appease her. I\u2019ve always just asked her to respect me for being my own person.\n\nNow I\u2019m moving OS, new life, new opportunities, she\u2019s cracked it again.

Before I went no contact with her the last time she told me I ruined her life by being born she was 30.\n\nMy parents didn't favour me at all, arguably the reverse, but there were terrible, traumatic experiences for her like the time my mother told us both that my birthday presents belonged to me and I was allowed to play with them myself.\n\nEdit to note: I didn't get more presents. My parents carefully made sure we got the same, but she got birthday presents from people other than our parents too which I never did because my birthday is close to Christmas.\n\nAt this point, as far as I'm aware, she's in her mid forties and has never managed a successful romantic relationship (where by \"successful\" I mean \"more than one date\") and has torched most of her friendships.\n\nShe deeply resents that I am in a stable long term relationship despite her efforts throughout my life to sabotage any friendship or relationship I had.
