We plan to get married at some point and openly discuss it, yet we do not put much emphasis on the whole thing so have no solid plans. We live in a fairly affluent coastal CT town, where I have grown up.\n\nI had a family friend offer to sell me his house off market in 2022. Sort of out of the blue. Unfortunately, I had just quit my job at that point so when it came time to qualify for a mortgage I was unable to be a part of that. She was able to qualify for the asking price by herself. The plan was that we would split the down payment even (15k each). As well as the mortgage ($1300 per month). We then purchased the house! We feel lucky because it was a good deal and in a great neighborhood. Since then, we all know the real estate market has only became more inflated and interest rates have sky rocketed.\n\nWe split EVERYTHING even, including all maintenance and improvements. We have had a lot of work done on the house, I would estimate I have spent another 10k personally on improvements, she has done the same. We have also put a TON of sweat equity into the house, endless nights and weekends fixing the house up. \n\nI am now paying even more than her ($1500) to pay off a new kitchen oven we purchased. I will add that she insisted on a very expensive oven, where I thought a more average one would be sufficient. \n\nI am starting to feel uneasy because I am in the hole close to 30k, not including equity from paying half of the mortgage. If she were to decide that she does not want to be with me anymore, I could be kicked to the curb and have no legal recourse to get my investment back. I am not saying she would not make an effort to pay me back but I know she does not have the funds to do so. \n\nI have recently said that I am not comfortable investing anymore money into the house until I legally own it. She will not put me on the deed. She wants me on the mortgage to be put on the deed although it does not make sense to refinance now or for the foreseeable future as the interest rate would be much higher than what we are locked in at. At this point I feel like this is boarder line financial abuse and I do not feel good about the situation. She says when the interest rates go down we can refinance and add me to the mortgage but I do not see that happening anytime soon and it is not a concrete. We are even on everything financially speaking and I think it would be fair to put me on the deed. :(", "created_utc": 1699997136, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17vcoqv/aitah_for_wanting_to_be_on_deed_of_girlfriends/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Meanwhile you have the opposite problem now, where you have no claim to your investment.\n\nAn option that wouldn't require a change to the deed or refinancing would be a sort of domestic partner financial agreement, where you both agree to your ongoing financial arrangement and also spell out how things work with the equity in the house if you split up.", "YTA\n\nUnless you sign on the mortgage, holding you equally liable for it, your name has no place on that deed.", "I wish people who aren't married would stop purchasing property together \ud83d\ude44", "You should be on the deed.

If you breakup today, you are not entitled to half the house NOR are you obligated to pay the mortgage. \n\nIf you are uncomfortable putting any more money into the house, then stop. You don't have to give her any more money, you don't have to live there, and you don't have to be with her. \n\nIf you want to stay with her, then you should probably stop having your emotions drive your decisions and meet her halfway on things. \n\nIf you really want to be fair, go online and see how much the house would rent for today and then start paying half of that as your portion. Subtract whatever rent equivalent you would have paid from living there so far from the 30K you put in and you have an amount that you are actually out of pocket.  \n\nAlso, just how mortgages work, you are probably really overestimating how much equity you are paying towards from each mortgage payment. In the early years of loans, most of the payment is allocated to interest.", "Seek legal advice. I believe there is a way for you to show financial interest in a home without being on the deed. This could be a state by state thing though.", "YTA. If you're not willing to be on the mortgage, you don't get to be on the deed. Your girlfriend's response is completely reasonable. You don't even pay the down payment.

You're just trading your instability for her instability, and it's incredibly callous to not even bother addressed the major downfalls to her in this post.

It is a huge risk to her to carry the debt alone while you own half the house.  In some jurisdictions, her mortgage company may prevent you from being added to the deed.  \n\nI would suggest writing a side contract that would indebt her to you formally in order to repay the expenses you've invested in the house, along with a reasonable amount of interest, in case of relationship breakdown.

She came back from court owing him $20,000 dollars. I don\u2019t know specifics about other states but it is possible in some at least. Just keep all of your financial statements.

Details of the location and details of the loan will matter.  While you generally would need to refinance to be added as a guarantor on the mortgage, there are many ways to become legally bound to the property that don't involve the mortgage.  Certain mortgages like FHA loans tend to be assumable, meaning you can add an additional partner if they also fit the mortgage rules. \n\nIn states with communal property laws, since you are at 7 years together it's also possible to do some legal wrangling if both of you are willing to sign some documents that will grant many of the same rights, including rights to divide the property in the event of a breakup.\n\nWhatever approach you go, you really should see a lawyer.

I can't really blame her either for not wanting you on the deed without being on the loan, just like you're saying you could be kicked out of the house and lose your investment, if she adds you to the deed without being on the mortgage you could just decide to stop contributing financially and she'll be the one on the hook for those payments, you'd continue building equity on a house you're no longer contributing to and you'd get half the profit when she sells it despite the fact you stopped paying. Most likely interest rates will drop around Feb/March, they always drop around presidential elections to make the current president look good, if you both keep your cool everyone can get what they want, just wait a couple months. Maybe it wont be as low as it was when she purchased but it shouldn't be as high as they currently are and you'll both have even skin in the game once you're on the loan.", "Totally agree. You need to be on both the mortgage and the deed, at the same time, to ensure fairness to both parties.\n\nPerhaps get the financial agreement in writing now, not legally just a note in plain language you both sign. You paid X down and are paying Y per month. You can add a note each time you spend extra on an item (like the oven) so it is noted and can be used as her acknowledgment of the facts should you separate. \n\nAlso keep copies of payments you make towards the house so you have back up should you break up.", "Exactly. Trust (or lack thereof) has to go both ways. Right now the gf has the upper hand and she needs to protect herself. If the situation were reversed, I doubt OOP would be comfortable putting someone on the deed who isn't on the mortgage. \n\nGoing forward, they could draw a legal agreement acknowledging the investment he made so far and committing to giving equity proportional to past and future contributions. And when refinancing is more attractive, they can go for a joint mortgage.", "Good take.", "Yup.  Sign an agreement saying that you get the down payment plus the monthly payments minus whatever counts as fair rent, but no deed without mortgage, baby.", "I don't really see it as a breakdown of trust. These are practical thoughts that anyone would have, even in the most loving relationships. Ultimately, OP is paying into the house and their partner could kick them to the curb tomorrow. It is the people that don't have these thoughts, that then make posts on reddit about how they had no agreement in place and lost half their house.\n\nFor OP: Seems you are paying half of everything and your partner wants to have you on the refinancing. Seems you need to speak more on this with her and ultimately see your own lawyer to write up an agreement so that all your payments and equity are protected. Just because you are not on the deed/mortgage, doesn't mean there aren't ways to protect yourself. It seems your partner wouldn't have issue with this seeing how you are both treating it like it is both your house already. Like others have said, simply adding you to the deed and not the mortgage isn't fair to your partner if anything were to happen with the relationship. \n\nI think it is actually unhealthy how you have it setup now as it all being in her name, while you pay half and both treat it as an equal investment, can easily lead to resentment (even unconscious resentment), and that will lead to much bigger issues.", "This is the correct answer.", "Except that he doesn't have to be added to the deed as a 50% owner. They should figure out what percentage of the total value of the house he has paid so far and add him to the deed at that percentage. It can be updated every year until they can refinance and add him to the mortgage at which point he can be added as a 50% owner. I used to work for a real estate law firm and saw this done all the time. I will say that I am not in CT, so the laws may be different there, but it's something to consider. But that way, his investment so far is protected, and yet she still owns the lion's share. If they split up, she can either buy out his portion, or they can sell and split the proceeds according to the split on the deed.", ">You are in a catch 22 here. If you refinance to put you on the mortgage, your rates go way up. But if she puts you on the house, she is legally responsible for the mortgage but you get no responsibility and half the house.\n\nThis is the way.", "Yep. Or if they do, they meet with a lawyer and draw up an agreement beforehand so everything is laid out for an easy purchase.", "Not being married isn't the problem with these ENDLESS posts of the same situation. It's that one partner was financially able to buy a house but the other partner wasn't. However partner #2 thinks any money they pay towards living there entitles them to an ownership stake. Yet they never think the same of an apartment they rent!\n\nThese details should be worked out before non-owner partner moves in. But no. They never are.", "They didn't purchase it together that's the issue. She purchased it and he's paying rent and extras as it is. The issue isn't unwed people buying it's her having him pay half of all costs without being on the deed and him wanting to go on the deed without going on the mortgage. If she puts him on the deed he could dip at any point still own the house but none of the debt.", "And having kids!", "I think it really depends how you go about it.

This \u201cadvice\u201d is stupid because again not everyone wants to be married.", "On the flip side, he should also be on the hook for the mortgage in order to not leave her with the full debt and only half the equity.  She also deserves the protection & security.", "Since he won't sign on to the mortgage, he will leave her liable for it, while still having half ownership. If he wants to be named, his name belongs on both the mortgage and the deed.", "The issue is those are two separate things. \n\nA deed gives you ownership to the house. The mortgage is the financial obligation. If he\u2019s on the deed and not the mortgage  now she is in the position where he could fuck her over as she\u2019s solely responsible for the mortgage but he is entitled to have the value of the house.", "Similarly they can ask the bank if he can be added to the mortgage without refinancing the terms.  This can be done if the mortgage is assumable.  For example, my VA home loan was assumable and I was able to add my wife and keep my 2.25% rate.", "It sure did here. Nobody ever fights over who owns the house if they bought it while married.", "Her ask for you to be on the mortgage is still just as reasonable as what you are asking \n\nYou both want protection and the only way for that to happen is to both be on the mortgage and the deed", "Not everyone wants to be married, but it provides legal and financial protections for situations like OP and his girlfriend.

Not less. You need More legal protection. \n\nIn this particular case, it doesn\u2019t even sound like they are averse to being married in the future. Just not really into it. Fine. It would make more sense to just put a ring on it than needlessly complicating things further. \n\nBut if they truly were against marriage, this should all have been put in legalese that both parties felt comfortable with PRIOR to buying the house and investing so much in it.
