We plan to get married at some point and openly discuss it, yet we do not put much emphasis on the whole thing so have no solid plans. We live in a fairly affluent coastal CT town, where I have grown up.\n\nI had a family friend offer to sell me his house off market in 2022. Sort of out of the blue. Unfortunately, I had just quit my job at that point so when it came time to qualify for a mortgage I was unable to be a part of that. She was able to qualify for the asking price by herself. The plan was that we would split the down payment even (15k each). As well as the mortgage ($1300 per month). We then purchased the house! We feel lucky because it was a good deal and in a great neighborhood. Since then, we all know the real estate market has only became more inflated and interest rates have sky rocketed.\n\nWe split EVERYTHING even, including all maintenance and improvements. We have had a lot of work done on the house, I would estimate I have spent another 10k personally on improvements, she has done the same. We have also put a TON of sweat equity into the house, endless nights and weekends fixing the house up. \n\nI am now paying even more than her ($1500) to pay off a new kitchen oven we purchased. I will add that she insisted on a very expensive oven, where I thought a more average one would be sufficient. \n\nI am starting to feel uneasy because I am in the hole close to 30k, not including equity from paying half of the mortgage. If she were to decide that she does not want to be with me anymore, I could be kicked to the curb and have no legal recourse to get my investment back. I am not saying she would not make an effort to pay me back but I know she does not have the funds to do so. \n\nI have recently said that I am not comfortable investing anymore money into the house until I legally own it. She will not put me on the deed. She wants me on the mortgage to be put on the deed although it does not make sense to refinance now or for the foreseeable future as the interest rate would be much higher than what we are locked in at. At this point I feel like this is boarder line financial abuse and I do not feel good about the situation. She says when the interest rates go down we can refinance and add me to the mortgage but I do not see that happening anytime soon and it is not a concrete.

Meanwhile you have the opposite problem now, where you have no claim to your investment.\n\nAn option that wouldn't require a change to the deed or refinancing would be a sort of domestic partner financial agreement, where you both agree to your ongoing financial arrangement and also spell out how things work with the equity in the house if you split up.", "YTA\n\nUnless you sign on the mortgage, holding you equally liable for it, your name has no place on that deed.", "I wish people who aren't married would stop purchasing property together \ud83d\ude44", "You should be on the deed.

NTA, but this isn\u2019t the hill to die on. It also is a smart financial decision for you both to avoid refinancing just to add you to a document long term.", "So, in my country even if you are not on the deed of a property you can legally ring-fence money you put into it so that if you break up, that money is safe. Could you talk to a solicitor about this possibility?", "You may have the option of assuming the mortgage in both names instead of refinancing. Check the loan documents to see if that\u2019s an option.", "NAH You need to sit down with her and have an in-depth discussion of finances now. Don\u2019t wait until you are engaged. Keep records of all your payments and investments. She should do the same. She is refusing to put you on the deed for the same reason you want to be on the deed, which is the fear of breaking up and risking a loss. As it stands, her position is more secure.\n\nConsult a lawyer in the meantime and draw up a contract that will allow you to split the house equitably in the event of a breakup. Engage a couples counselor to work on your trust issues. All couples should get counseling before marriage anyway.", "ntah  for wanting your name on deed you help pay the the mortgage half your in my opinion i would talk to your bank and lawyer to see  if  your name can be added without having do anything with your mortgage", "Easy fix, get married and all properties are considered joint property.", "Nta are the renovations paid off or in your name? If not, as some suggested, only pay what a typical local renter would pay.

I understand you have paid your half but still, you could also bounce and screw her level very easily by forcing a sale. That's why everyone recommends not mixing finances or getting property until legally married.", "YTA. You want to own part of the house. You need to own part of the mortgage.\n\nAlso, at least where I live, banks require all owners to be on the mortgage if they are on the title of the property.", "NAH. You\u2019re both correct in looking out for your interests.  Draw up an agreement on mortgage payments and ownership that protects you both.  Then when it makes financial sense, put your name on the mortgage and deed.  They have to happen at the same time.", "Just get married to her? It could even be a small and romantic thing in the local town hall.", "Financial abuse? She's asking you for the same thing you asked her. Yta lol", "YTA. \n\nYour request is totally reasonable but so is hers.  You can't have one without the other.  It's your own fault for not being more involved during the house buying process and ensuring your name was there on legal documents. You're both in agreement that it doesn't make sense to refinance right now with the cost of living so you may just need to suck it up.  Don't be an idiot and throw away your relationship over it.  Your attitude about this is just odd.\nYou've been together for 7 years and have talked about getting married, having a future so why are you suddenly so worried about this?  \n\nYou can probably get a legal document of some sort (depending on where you live) like a cohabitation agreement drawn up that states what you have both contributed and that you own the property together.", "YTA for agreing in the first place. Mortgage + deed or nothing.", "Great answer.", "Depending on where they live marriage could be the easy answer (consult a lawyer)", "^^^^ this needs to be higher", "Without the opportunity provided by ops friend there woul be no house. Seems like a missed detail.", "Eh depending on where you are it's a premarital asset and until he's on the deed if they get divorced it's just hers", "\ud83d\udc4f thank you!", "Yep. My ex was dating me and another girl at the same time. The idiot decided to buy a house with her, screwing literally everyone over. When we found out about each other, she made him sell the house less than a year after buying it. He blamed me for the huge mess. Sorry, but if I\u2019m ever buying a house with someone, they are signing the legally binding marriage agreement before the house agreement.", "Yeah pretty dumb", "amen!", "This !!! I don\u2019t get it like you\u2019re BF/GF and buying a house ?", "Well technically they didn't purchase together. She purchased and he is just gifting her money every month ...", "\u2026.she may not be abusing him but she is sure as hell taking advantage.

Commission, business owner, etc - banks don\u2019t like that.", "Sure but then OP shouldn\u2019t be expected to pay for renovations and home improvements (grocieries and utilities is fair, plus things like cleaning supplies and the day to day stuff)", "Yeah OP needs a real estate lawyer from his area, not Reddit. I'm sure there's a workable option legally and figuring that out would be much more helpful to the relationship than complaining on Reddit about GF not liking his solution. Although it was very dumb that they didn't get this hashed out when they bought it together instead of waiting a year (or maybe more) to figure out that this was not a super secure option.", "Frankly this should have been done when they bought the house. It's wild that he paid part of the down-payment without being on the deed or have any kind of guarantee.", "Unless it was the only house for sale in the area, it has no bearing on the issue.

Marriage doesn\u2019t solve anything. In reality most couples there is one person getting screwed in divorce", "He paid just as much of the down payment as she did.  For all intents and purposes, they did buy it together, just not on paper.  It was a massive mistake to do this without some sort of legal agreement which is what they need to rectify before resentment takes over", "Man, that reminds me of a guy I was seeing. He had assured me that he was dating a girl, it was an open relationship, that she knew about me but didn\u2019t like to engage because of a bad situation in the past. I didn\u2019t mind, because I\u2019m married and my wife occupies most of my attention and liked the guy too (platonically, we would hang out the three of us sometimes). Found it odd that when he bought a house, he adamantly refused any help painting and stuff. \n\nWell, I moved away and was considering talking to him about coming up for a visit a month in and ended up stumbling across a wedding website for him and his wife. Turned out she didn\u2019t know about me, it wasn\u2019t an open relationship, and now he was going to be stuck having to sell that house less than six months after buying it.", "Being married makes a huge difference. There are established procedures for dividing property owned by two married people. If you have two (legally) separate people in a business relationship it gets much messier.", "Makes a big legal difference.", "It makes a huge difference.  The problem is that people *don't* think it does and then have problems later on because they don't have the protections that marriage provides *and* they don't put contracts in place to protect themselves in a non-marital living situation.", "You can to two things - get added as co burrower if bank doesn\u2019t allow. Put the property in a living trust - with both as trustees", "But theoretically, you could be added to the deed, then decide to break up in a year or two or five. She'd be stuck with the responsibility of a mortgage while you were not. You'd still be on the deed, though, with no obligation to continue to pay.\n\nIt's not fair to either of you the way things are now. Maybe you should go ahead and get married, since you both plan to eventually anyway. If not, you should see a lawyer together to get a contract sorted out that would protect you both in case your relationship ends.", "OP from now on what you should do is find out how much it would be to rent a room in your area and pay that amount amount as rent. Make sure you sign a lease agreement with your gf so you have protection should she ever try to kick you out. Then you pay 50% of utilities and groceries along with rent and that\u2019s it. No more money towards house improvements or anything like that. If you aren\u2019t on the deed you shouldn\u2019t be paying towards those expenses - that\u2019s the landlord\u2019s job (ie your gf).", "Sure, not everyone wants to be married and that's fine.  The problem is that they want to play \"pretend married\" where they enter serious joint commitments like buying a house without the arms-length negotiation and you'd do if this was a business partner.

Even if they were married, he probably wouldn\u2019t be on the mortgage because of his lack of a job during the time they bought the house. Additionally, there\u2019s a chance he would be be on the deed too. So they\u2019d probably be in the same situation just marriage. \n\nFor a sub that love to pride itself on being open minded, y\u2019all certainly don\u2019t like people challenging your though process about how people should live their lives.", "OP says it was a \"good deal\" but not below market and not a rare opportunity.

Like I\u2019d aid I work in real estate and mortgage banking, many married couples weren\u2019t able to buy a house together for various reason.

Being linear minded in that fact is asinine.\n\nAgain, I bring up the point that he probably wouldn\u2019t be on the mortgage even if they were married. He may not have even been on the deed if they were marriage.\n\nI\u2019m not putting a religious or moral context on marriage.

Even you\u2019re involvement in this sub can be looked at as living your life wrong, but is it? Anyway, live your life how you want.
