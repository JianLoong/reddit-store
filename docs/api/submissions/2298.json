We both get along very well with each other\u2019s families.\n\nThe only exception is his father. Their family dynamic had always been one where the dad dictates everything, and you never question the dad or stand up to him. His dad has always been pretty avoidant when it comes to having conversations with me. I sent him a message when we got engaged saying I\u2019m so excited to be part of the family, and he never acknowledged it. At this point, I just feel like the guy doesn\u2019t respect me enough to value anything I say. My fianc\u00e9 has tried to encourage his dad to interact more with us to no avail. \n\nOn Halloween, I asked my fianc\u00e9 if we could take my son/his stepson over to his parents\u2019 in his costume. His father\u2019s only attempt at conversation was asking how old my son is and what grade he\u2019s in, which is info I relayed in my own attempts at breaking the ice multiple times since meeting him. Later at home I asked my fianc\u00e9 he also thought it was weird.\n\nA week later we were at their house again. His dad eventually said \u201cDoes your son go to school? What age is he?\u201d In my head I was like are you serious? I answered \u201cHe is 6 and in first grade. Actually we spoke about this last week.\u201d\n\nI needed a minute after that, so I excused myself. I was venting to my fianc\u00e9 and his mom ran in the kitchen. She kept saying \u201cThat\u2019s just the way he is. Everyone else just deals with it. Why can\u2019t you?\u201d And I said \u201cJust because everyone else chooses to accept it doesn\u2019t really mean I have to.\u201d His father came in and said \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d I explained that it upset me that after over a year there was virtually no relationship between us. He said \u201cThat's because I don\u2019t know you.\u201d My fianc\u00e9 stepped in and said \u201cHey, that\u2019s my stepson and future wife and I haven\u2019t seen you take initiative to welcome them into our family. Not even a congratulations after we got engaged.\u201d His dad said \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since you got engaged,\u201d which my fianc\u00e9 pointed out was untrue and he had seen me 3 times including the week before. \n\nHis dad then became irate toward my fianc\u00e9. He was raising his voice and scaring my child, so we headed to the door. He started calling my fianc\u00e9 all types of names, threatening him, and screaming \u201cFuck you\u201d to me and my son. \n\nAfter 2 days, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom messaged him \u201cSo I guess you\u2019re never talking to me again.\u201d My fianc\u00e9 said he wants space until there can be a conversation without playing the blame game.

Your future MIL enables your future FIL's shitty behavior, but also...is it possible your FIL is dealing with some genuine memory issues? I ask this because my own pops tends to repeat the same questions over and over, and it can be a bit frustrating because it feels like he doesn't retain or pay attention to conversations we have, but I think it's just a byproduct of aging.

I will say it\u2019s annoying but an old man not remembering what age and grade your son is in...not a big deal in the big picture. It appears he\u2019s past a grumpy old man and he honesty just wants to be left alone. He appears to not want to be social. He may not even like his son. Heck he may only tolerate people in his house bc his wife wants them there. At that point you forcing a relationship with him is silly. He doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re getting married. He doesn\u2019t care if you have a kid. He appears to just want to be left alone to be in his quiet house. It also sounds like your fianc\u00e9 hasn\u2019t accepted dad doesn\u2019t care. Invite the mom out. Let dad sulk at home. Is it sad he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you? Yes. Does that mean it\u2019s ok to throw a temper tantrum to the point of causing the drama? Not really. Take time. Cool off. Spend time with those who want a relationship. Let the others be.\nEdited to add: reading comments the dementia thing cropped up. That is a very valid point. When my MIL was showing wary signs we almost went no contact. The night we told her we were pregnant with baby two she was fleetingly happy but dropped it quickly. (Now we know she forgot.) when it was time to leave she told our six year old if she threw enough of a temper tantrum we would let her stay the night. (We heard her say this multiple times.) We finally got her loaded in the car (still throwing the temper tantrum.). To which my MIL, very upset that our child was hysterical, said, \u201cif she hates leaving with you that much you must be abusing her. I\u2019m calling CPS.\u201d My husband drove off with me in tears thinking she was calling CPS on us. He then called her and chewed her out telling her if she behaved like this again we would never come back. (It was awhile before we saw her again. I had a belly then and oh are you pregnant!) When DH brought up the behavior she acted like he was crazy and said she\u2019s never do that. Slowly but surely she started isolating herself bc she couldn\u2019t remember names. She only shopped at a place called the dollar general which was more of a quick stop. Maybe 4 aisles of groceries. Then she went to only TV dinners bc she was having problems working the stove. Eventually we were planning on moving her in but in the mean time we were taking her shopping for real foods and would stop by every week (we lived a good distance and had to get her place ready). One week we came to visit and she went straight to the hospital. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything we bought in a week. She was forgetting to eat and had a stomach ache (from inot eating). Anger and isolation is a first sign of dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s.", "NTA it is definitely a toxic situation.

Why would you make your husband lose his relationships over something like this ?", "YTA on this one. It sounds like it's not personal and \"that's just how he is\" means this is a recurring problem that might be due to cognitive issues or some other issue that has nothing to do with you. I'm not sure what you think you were standing up against when he wasn't doing anything to you personally. Getting to know each other goes both ways and you decided to cause drama instead of trying to figure out what's going on with him or why he's like that.", "YTA in that you expect a welcome, for the future FIL to be any different than he is, and for pushing the situation.

The dad may never remember you and it doesn't have memory issues and is just a jerk, that's a thing too.", "NTA, that being said, your FFIL has dementia or early on-set Alzhiemers. I went through this with an aunt. \n\nThe outbursts of anger over being called out on his memory, is from embarrassment. He needs to see a Neurologist.", "NTA \n\nBut honestly, if it's me I'll just let him be.\n\nI was in a slightly similar situation just that the person that was not bothering to talk to me was my BIL. He only started talking to me (out of necessity) 2 months ago. We got married December 2019... we have two kids now. His first sentence to me was, how did you guys get here?\n\nIn the past two years plus, almost nothing lol.", "NTA\n\nvery toxic family, but so heartwarming to see your fiance standing up for you. When one grows up in such environment and becomes used to it, it can be very difficult to see it for what it really is, but he is not blind to it, unlike his mother. \n\nYour future MIL use of an emotional blackmail is a very low blow.", "NTA, but FIL is clearly having beginnings of memory failure.", "INFO:  Is it possible your FIL has some sort of memory disorder?", "YTA. Your post is ALL about you and from what you've written, you still don't question your FIL's memory problems? And even if it isn't, maybe that's just how he is but because it doesn't work for you, you decide that you need to force it to be just the way YOU like. You haven't been with your fiance all that long either. Is it possible that your FIL might need more time to get to know you.", "ESH", "My first thought as a nurse. Seems very familiar.", "My mom got EOA when she was in her mid 50s. Please encourage your husband's family to get him tested. There are medications that can slow the damage, but nothing I'm aware of can reverse it.", "I was a long term care nurse for over 20 years, primarily dealing with dementia patients. My own father also suffered from early onset dementia. It really does happen. In the early stages they develop coping strategies that help disguise the symptoms, and they may become extremely hostile and defensive when confronted about forgetting things. Early onset dementia usually progresses more rapidly as well. FIL definitely needs some testing.", "This is the exact time my grandmother started showing symptoms. You may need to get him evaluated.", "NTA - talk to your fiance, take his mom out for lunch or something it sounds like dad is having memory issues maybe even more than that. Good luck", "In either case there is no real cure unfortunately.", "Hi, FFIL! And if you had actually read the post, it was not OP who was acting combative and entitled.", "yeah, I'm terrible with names. but I'm really open with people about that. new coworkers tend to get an \"Hi, I'm RAK. I'm going to reintroduce myself to you 5x. I'm sorry pre-emptively.\"\n\nIt's no one's fault that I take awhile to learn names. That's how I'm wired.", "She\u2019s way too busy being a passive aggressive burning martyr \ud83d\ude44", "Seriously? He yelled \"FUCK YOU\" to a six year old. \n\n...also I also have diagnosed ADHD and would never just expect other people to put up with my memory issues. I'm trying to work on them and I take the consequences when I forget things and try to write stuff down everyday. I hate when people try to use something like that as an excuse for treating people, especially defenseless kids, awfully. \n\nIf he has dementia that really sucks but that doesn't change how he treated OP and her son, and how his wife acted. She didn't even pick a fight, having boundaries and telling someone who isn't treating you right what they're doing isn't picking a fight.", "Are you serious? Even if OP was rude, which she wasn\u2019t, there is zero excuse to scream \u201cfuck you\u201d at a woman and her child. My husband has severe ADHD and he forgets stuff but he still makes an effort to talk to people and be polite even if he has a bad memory for things like ages, dates, etc.", "Nope, OP is in no way the asshole. No one was \"picking a fight\" but the MiL and FiL. A private conversation they butted into is on them. \nBeing ND doesn't excuse bad behaviour. I do think FiL needs a checkup for memory issues\n\nOP, you're NTA", "How is he making an attempt here", "'He may be literally incapable of remembering your son's age and grade because of a medical condition, but he should have the common courtesy to just not have that medical condition'", "That doesn\u2019t mean he gets to scream \u201cfuck you\u201d at a child. Or that his wife needs to make herself out to be the victim.", "You should read your response again... it was important to your fianc\u00e9 to \u201chave us be one big happy family\u201d .... So YOU chose to blow it up & now no one is happy. These people have lived their lives without your help ... and raised a son that you love. Give them a tiny bit of respect. Sorry, but you don\u2019t get to walk in & think you have all the answers for his family. So unless you\u2019re coming from a place of caring & kindness... maybe don\u2019t participate.", "Honest question, why do you care so much about FIL? He did kinda try to interact with your son, yeah he is repeating himself but it's an effort. He was never like, mean until this. Like others have said, could be memory issues, or he's just not that interested. I understand being upset now after the outburst but not before.", "The only thing I\u2019d point out there is that, often, those with dementia or Alzheimer\u2019s aren\u2019t aware they have memory problems. And irritability, anger and even rage can also be part of both of those conditions. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t excuse the mother - but she may be in denial or not even have realised that\u2019s the problem. I do agree with your last sentence, explaining why you are hurt by someone\u2019s actions isn\u2019t picking a fight. OP could perhaps be more aware that there are other potential issues at play though and take those into account.", "Pretty sure he was yelling it at the mother who threw a temper tantrum bc he wasn\u2019t interacting with her and her child how she wanted on her terms in his house. I\u2019m not defending his actions. I just don\u2019t think his not wanting to be overly active isn\u2019t a reason for her to throw a temper tantrum.", "This is the most reasonable response here....\n\nIt\u2019s so bizarre to me that people think they can walk in to someone else\u2019s home/life & believe they know how to do it better ... they going to \u201cfix\u201d everyone. Give me a break ... these people lived a long time without OP\u2019s help, just doing their own thing until OP showed up. Now no one is happy. Welcome to the family!!! Please help us, don\u2019t help!!!\n\nEta", "It\u2019s not about him simply repeating the question though. It\u2019s about the fact that her future FIL has already been told these things about her son, and hasn\u2019t seemed to make an effort to remember them\u2014then blames HER for the lack of a relationship by claiming shit like \u201cI haven\u2019t seen you since the engagement\u201d when he\u2019s seen her three times since then! I mean jesus he only ever wants to talk about the kid, and then can\u2019t even remember if the kid\u2019s in school yet or not?? Maybe he has indeed been having memory problems for years already, like others suggested\u2014or maybe he\u2019s just always been an AH who makes no effort to get to know anyone, including his own grandson that he *does talk to people about*, because people like his own wife excuse it as \u201cjust being how he is\u201d. He\u2019s not an AH outright for having memory problems if that is the case, but is an AH if he knows about having them and then lashes out at people who don\u2019t know. He\u2019s not required to get to know his DIL, but if he\u2019s gonna ask about his grandson, he should at least try to retain the information he\u2019s told (potential memory issues aside).", "Oh sorry, so he repeatedly screamed \u201cfuck you\u201d at a child\u2019s mother in front of the child. That\u2019s still absolutely unacceptable behavior. She pointed out that he was being cold to her and her child, which was true. He could have asked her to leave, he could have said a number of things privately to her, but he made a scene in front of her child and screamed obscenities at her. Even if you think OP was rude, nothing she did justifies that behavior.", "Or maybe the guy doesn\u2019t like to socialize with people and doesn\u2019t have a clue what he should be talking about with someone he doesn\u2019t know.... I guess I\u2019m looking at this very differently than everyone here. The man is who he is & he\u2019s live a long time being who he is. We can all guess or speculate as to why he is the way he is but it honestly doesn\u2019t matter. Just based on the information provided he has never been rude or disrespectful to OP. If you want to get along with your IL\u2019s maybe don\u2019t try to change your fianc\u00e9\u2019s Dad because he\u2019s not a friendly guy that gushes over everything you do. Sorry no one gets to the right to walk in to my house & \u201cfix\u201d my family by making everyone unhappy.", "If you choose not to learn how to do basic things like engage in small talk and remembering details about people important to your kid...then people are going to respond to what you're sending out."]}
