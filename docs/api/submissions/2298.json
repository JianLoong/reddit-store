Their family dynamic had always been one where the dad dictates everything, and you never question the dad or stand up to him. His dad has always been pretty avoidant when it comes to having conversations with me.

At this point, I just feel like the guy doesn\u2019t respect me enough to value anything I say. My fianc\u00e9 has tried to encourage his dad to interact more with us to no avail. \n\nOn Halloween, I asked my fianc\u00e9 if we could take my son/his stepson over to his parents\u2019 in his costume. His father\u2019s only attempt at conversation was asking how old my son is and what grade he\u2019s in, which is info I relayed in my own attempts at breaking the ice multiple times since meeting him. Later at home I asked my fianc\u00e9 he also thought it was weird.\n\nA week later we were at their house again. His dad eventually said \u201cDoes your son go to school? What age is he?\u201d In my head I was like are you serious? I answered \u201cHe is 6 and in first grade. Actually we spoke about this last week.\u201d\n\nI needed a minute after that, so I excused myself. I was venting to my fianc\u00e9 and his mom ran in the kitchen. She kept saying \u201cThat\u2019s just the way he is. Everyone else just deals with it. Why can\u2019t you?\u201d And I said \u201cJust because everyone else chooses to accept it doesn\u2019t really mean I have to.\u201d His father came in and said \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d I explained that it upset me that after over a year there was virtually no relationship between us. He said \u201cThat's because I don\u2019t know you.\u201d My fianc\u00e9 stepped in and said \u201cHey, that\u2019s my stepson and future wife and I haven\u2019t seen you take initiative to welcome them into our family. Not even a congratulations after we got engaged.\u201d His dad said \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since you got engaged,\u201d which my fianc\u00e9 pointed out was untrue and he had seen me 3 times including the week before. \n\nHis dad then became irate toward my fianc\u00e9. He was raising his voice and scaring my child, so we headed to the door. He started calling my fianc\u00e9 all types of names, threatening him, and screaming \u201cFuck you\u201d to me and my son. \n\nAfter 2 days, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom messaged him \u201cSo I guess you\u2019re never talking to me again.\u201d My fianc\u00e9 said he wants space until there can be a conversation without playing the blame game.

Your future MIL enables your future FIL's shitty behavior, but also...is it possible your FIL is dealing with some genuine memory issues? I ask this because my own pops tends to repeat the same questions over and over, and it can be a bit frustrating because it feels like he doesn't retain or pay attention to conversations we have, but I think it's just a byproduct of aging. That's not to say your future FIL isn't an asshole, but his assholery could be mixed in with some aging symptoms too. Just food for thought.", "NTA. I will say it\u2019s annoying but an old man not remembering what age and grade your son is in...not a big deal in the big picture. It appears he\u2019s past a grumpy old man and he honesty just wants to be left alone. He appears to not want to be social. He may not even like his son. Heck he may only tolerate people in his house bc his wife wants them there. At that point you forcing a relationship with him is silly. He doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re getting married. He doesn\u2019t care if you have a kid. He appears to just want to be left alone to be in his quiet house. It also sounds like your fianc\u00e9 hasn\u2019t accepted dad doesn\u2019t care. Invite the mom out. Let dad sulk at home. Is it sad he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you? Yes. Does that mean it\u2019s ok to throw a temper tantrum to the point of causing the drama? Not really. Take time. Cool off. Spend time with those who want a relationship. Let the others be.\nEdited to add: reading comments the dementia thing cropped up. That is a very valid point. When my MIL was showing wary signs we almost went no contact. The night we told her we were pregnant with baby two she was fleetingly happy but dropped it quickly. (Now we know she forgot.) when it was time to leave she told our six year old if she threw enough of a temper tantrum we would let her stay the night. (We heard her say this multiple times.) We finally got her loaded in the car (still throwing the temper tantrum.). To which my MIL, very upset that our child was hysterical, said, \u201cif she hates leaving with you that much you must be abusing her. I\u2019m calling CPS.\u201d My husband drove off with me in tears thinking she was calling CPS on us. He then called her and chewed her out telling her if she behaved like this again we would never come back. (It was awhile before we saw her again. I had a belly then and oh are you pregnant!) When DH brought up the behavior she acted like he was crazy and said she\u2019s never do that. Slowly but surely she started isolating herself bc she couldn\u2019t remember names. She only shopped at a place called the dollar general which was more of a quick stop. Maybe 4 aisles of groceries. Then she went to only TV dinners bc she was having problems working the stove. Eventually we were planning on moving her in but in the mean time we were taking her shopping for real foods and would stop by every week (we lived a good distance and had to get her place ready). One week we came to visit and she went straight to the hospital. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything we bought in a week. She was forgetting to eat and had a stomach ache (from inot eating). Anger and isolation is a first sign of dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s.", "NTA it is definitely a toxic situation.

Why would you make your husband lose his relationships over something like this ?", "YTA on this one. It sounds like it's not personal and \"that's just how he is\" means this is a recurring problem that might be due to cognitive issues or some other issue that has nothing to do with you. I'm not sure what you think you were standing up against when he wasn't doing anything to you personally. Getting to know each other goes both ways and you decided to cause drama instead of trying to figure out what's going on with him or why he's like that.", "YTA in that you expect a welcome, for the future FIL to be any different than he is, and for pushing the situation.

But my husband has memory issues himself some from getting older (mid 50s) and some from chemo meds.  He may not honestly remember or realize he's seen you or your son but pride won't let him admit that to anyone especially himself. And a wife can sometimes be in denial of a problem like that..basically just used to smoothing over a situation if it arises.  I would recommend your other half try to talk to his mom about having him get a physical and talk honestly to his doctor to see what kind of tests can be done to see if it's a medical problem.  Not to cause any distress but these signs can also be a tumor causing pressure on the brain.  Better to check then walk away angry to just find out it was something that could have been found out sooner.  Best of luck to you", "NTA, wow. Winners all around.  Mom is the worst for that terrible guilt trip. Just walk away.", "Except mom says that\u2019s how dad is and expected fianc\u00e9 to know that too. Which means mom thinks it\u2019s been going on since before fianc\u00e9 moved out. \n\nThat\u2019s a long time for the memory issues to stay about the same and not get a lot worse.", "Agreed. That\u2019s the first thing I thought. It sounds like he does have memory problems and maybe it bothers him. It could stem from trauma - which also could explain the lack of socialization (does OP\u2019s fianc\u00e9 know anything about his dads childhood?) \nThere is absolutely no excuse for the yelling and swearing though. Especially in front of a child. \nAfter things cool down, maybe talk to the mom to see if she thinks he might have memory issues (she may not want to admit it or think so though). If comfortable, maybe try having more family dinners. Instead of trying to talk with the father to engage conversation, try talking to mother about yourself and your son. Maybe more updates will help engage father. \nIf father is truly TA and doesn\u2019t care to get to know or engage then maybe you consider some distance (but since he\u2019s asked the same question multiple times it kind of seems like he does want to know, he just forgets?)", "Thing to keep in mind, is his wife thinks this is how he is. So it\u2019s been going on 20+ years? That\u2019s unlikely to be Alzheimer\u2019s. Though it could be something else.", "Nta, but even being young he could still have issues. My daughter's roommate's mom is about this age and has Alzheimer's that has progressed rapidly \ud83d\ude14 Hopefully he can get tested soon.", "I mean even if thats true i dont think that shes going to be one of the assholes. How would she be able to recognize that in him without knowing him too well beforehand? At the same time some people will just say they don't remember because they are lying and dont want to own up to something.", "Agreed 100%.", "She got angry at him for asking a question he wasn't being disrespectful or anything. And if the comments were right and he does have dementia, can you really be mad at the man? But I agree that the mil is such an asshole", "Christ on a cracker. What an awful thing to say. What is going on with this sub lately?!", "I suspect she knows, deep down, and is scared/in denial. That's not an excuse - she's definitely an AH here - just a possible explanation.", "She\u2019s not sweet. She\u2019s sounds manipulative as hell.", "I would wonder if she has noticed more about the memory issue.  It\u2019s weird that he would not remember the last week meet up.  Her saying that\u2019s just the way he is might be her way to deal with something she doesn\u2019t know how to deal with.", "IF he does, then yeah, not his fault! But then that is something the fam has to address instead of let it pass. Man might be needing help! The MIL tho? Nah, she started drama straight away", "Gods yes!! I'll know your face, but it'll be a bit before the name sticks.  And street names. Tell me the name and I'll end up everywhere but there, Now tell me what's around the place, no problem see you in 20  lmao", "We have 3 out of 11 in our dept with the same name.  That helps in remembering.  The rest all have nicknames.  There's the downstairs overlord, the commander,  etc.  The nicknames are also why a couple of us will probably never be promoted unless they just get tired of dealing with us and want us to be someone else's headache.  It's loads of fun though", "I get what you are saying. Those last texts seemed manipulative as hell. but at the same time, singled out messages with no full nuance of how people act is not a full picture.\n\nFor example, from your above message it seems like you are a judgemental, negative and honestly unpleasant to be around. Also sounds like you have severe past trauma from damaged relationships with your parents and even extended family. However, all of this is an assumption based on your tone. \n\nYou can't judge someone based of texts to people close with them, because often their guard is down the most. and if all other times OP says the mother is sweet. We can only judge based on that.", "What the utter fuck is going on with this sub lately that there are this many people jumping in to excuse this as just being a \"grumpy old man\"? Like - what?", "> recognising people when you're face blind usually means recognising their gait, posture, and clothing style\n\nI'm beginning to think I am also face-blind. I recognize people by their voices and the way they move. Only after I've known them on a personal basis for a while do I recognize them. I once had a very long nice interview and when I later got the job and met my boss, I had to cover up the fact that I didn't realize she was one of the ones who interviewed me. \n\nIn my 30s, I moved away and a friend sent me a group photo from a business association that I had been involved in for ten years. I didn't recognize a single person. They weren't moving or talking!\n\nI also put stickers on my car bumpers so I can know that it's my car. Why are 90% of the cars on the road gray sedans?!?! LOL", "While I have the fear that I won't recognize someone, I generally know that I should know someone but I just have absolutely no clue.", "Nah, some people are literally just bad with names. I'm one of those people. I have no trouble recognizing anyone I've met before, even if it was only once years ago. I'll usually remember what letter their name starts with or what it sounds like, but I usually have to describe them or how I met them/who they were with to someone else so they can help me with their name. On the other hand, if the person has a dog, 90% of the time I'll remember the dog's name, because I LOVE DOGS and I'm way more interested in their dog than in them, so it's easier for me to remember their dog's name \ud83d\ude02 half the time, I'd go \"you know, Buddy's owner?\"", ">However, all of this is an assumption based on your tone.\n\nAll of this is an assumption based on your imagination.", "I assume they\u2019re people with toxic families or who are toxic themselves?? Because I would disown someone so fast their head would spin if they did that to me.", "Yeah, you totally are! \ud83d\ude02 The name is misleading because we aren't blind to faces, we see them, but we can't memorize them like others do. Apparently there's a totally different part of the brain that processes faces to other visuals, so I can have a brilliant visual memory but not recognise my partner. (Extreme example, only happened once, but he wasn't moving at the time and had changed clothes.) It's such a relief though once you know and can just tell people! You're not being an indifferent wastrel, other people have a natural ability you don't.", "That def sounds like face blindness to me. I was mid thirties before I found out. There are so many other ways one recognises people besides faces that it's easy to blame it on other things. Do you struggle telling characters apart on TV / in films? War films are my worst because so many people have the same clothes and haircut.", "my apartment complex is full of dog owners and my bf and I know all of the dog names and no people names lol. we refer to the people as \"Buddys mom/dad\"\ud83d\ude02", "Oh yeah people are definitely bad with names, but those people tend to know if they've introduced themselves to someone before! I seriously envy just being bad with names, tbh. It's very common with face blindness though to think you're bad with names when you're actually not recognizing faces / not realizing you've met the person before. As the person I was responding to described.", "Exactly, it\u2019s absurd", "I can\u2019t follow films easily if there\u2019s a lot of characters.  I especially have trouble with war films, or rom coms where everyone is blonde", "Yeah I got this through brain damage. So it can even happen later in life especially if you have played football or similar.", "You completely missed the point. You are the one reading into someones text stuff that isn't there.\n\nYou are behaving like a judgmental, sanctimonious asshole.\n\nHow dare you go around insulting people and diagnose them because you don't like their *tone*?", "Welcome to the face blind club! You can now just tell people and feel a lifetime of guilt fall away!"]}
