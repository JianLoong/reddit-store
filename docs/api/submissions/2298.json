We both get along very well with each other\u2019s families.\n\nThe only exception is his father. Their family dynamic had always been one where the dad dictates everything, and you never question the dad or stand up to him. His dad has always been pretty avoidant when it comes to having conversations with me. I sent him a message when we got engaged saying I\u2019m so excited to be part of the family, and he never acknowledged it. At this point, I just feel like the guy doesn\u2019t respect me enough to value anything I say. My fianc\u00e9 has tried to encourage his dad to interact more with us to no avail. \n\nOn Halloween, I asked my fianc\u00e9 if we could take my son/his stepson over to his parents\u2019 in his costume. His father\u2019s only attempt at conversation was asking how old my son is and what grade he\u2019s in, which is info I relayed in my own attempts at breaking the ice multiple times since meeting him. Later at home I asked my fianc\u00e9 he also thought it was weird.\n\nA week later we were at their house again. His dad eventually said \u201cDoes your son go to school? What age is he?\u201d In my head I was like are you serious? I answered \u201cHe is 6 and in first grade. Actually we spoke about this last week.\u201d\n\nI needed a minute after that, so I excused myself. I was venting to my fianc\u00e9 and his mom ran in the kitchen. She kept saying \u201cThat\u2019s just the way he is. Everyone else just deals with it. Why can\u2019t you?\u201d And I said \u201cJust because everyone else chooses to accept it doesn\u2019t really mean I have to.\u201d His father came in and said \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d I explained that it upset me that after over a year there was virtually no relationship between us. He said \u201cThat's because I don\u2019t know you.\u201d My fianc\u00e9 stepped in and said \u201cHey, that\u2019s my stepson and future wife and I haven\u2019t seen you take initiative to welcome them into our family. Not even a congratulations after we got engaged.\u201d His dad said \u201cI haven\u2019t seen her since you got engaged,\u201d which my fianc\u00e9 pointed out was untrue and he had seen me 3 times including the week before. \n\nHis dad then became irate toward my fianc\u00e9. He was raising his voice and scaring my child, so we headed to the door. He started calling my fianc\u00e9 all types of names, threatening him, and screaming \u201cFuck you\u201d to me and my son. \n\nAfter 2 days, my fianc\u00e9\u2019s mom messaged him \u201cSo I guess you\u2019re never talking to me again.\u201d My fianc\u00e9 said he wants space until there can be a conversation without playing the blame game.

Your future MIL enables your future FIL's shitty behavior, but also...is it possible your FIL is dealing with some genuine memory issues? I ask this because my own pops tends to repeat the same questions over and over, and it can be a bit frustrating because it feels like he doesn't retain or pay attention to conversations we have, but I think it's just a byproduct of aging. That's not to say your future FIL isn't an asshole, but his assholery could be mixed in with some aging symptoms too. Just food for thought.", "NTA. I will say it\u2019s annoying but an old man not remembering what age and grade your son is in...not a big deal in the big picture. It appears he\u2019s past a grumpy old man and he honesty just wants to be left alone. He appears to not want to be social. He may not even like his son. Heck he may only tolerate people in his house bc his wife wants them there. At that point you forcing a relationship with him is silly. He doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re getting married. He doesn\u2019t care if you have a kid. He appears to just want to be left alone to be in his quiet house. It also sounds like your fianc\u00e9 hasn\u2019t accepted dad doesn\u2019t care. Invite the mom out. Let dad sulk at home. Is it sad he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with you? Yes. Does that mean it\u2019s ok to throw a temper tantrum to the point of causing the drama? Not really. Take time. Cool off. Spend time with those who want a relationship. Let the others be.\nEdited to add: reading comments the dementia thing cropped up. That is a very valid point. When my MIL was showing wary signs we almost went no contact. The night we told her we were pregnant with baby two she was fleetingly happy but dropped it quickly. (Now we know she forgot.) when it was time to leave she told our six year old if she threw enough of a temper tantrum we would let her stay the night. (We heard her say this multiple times.) We finally got her loaded in the car (still throwing the temper tantrum.). To which my MIL, very upset that our child was hysterical, said, \u201cif she hates leaving with you that much you must be abusing her. I\u2019m calling CPS.\u201d My husband drove off with me in tears thinking she was calling CPS on us. He then called her and chewed her out telling her if she behaved like this again we would never come back. (It was awhile before we saw her again. I had a belly then and oh are you pregnant!) When DH brought up the behavior she acted like he was crazy and said she\u2019s never do that. Slowly but surely she started isolating herself bc she couldn\u2019t remember names. She only shopped at a place called the dollar general which was more of a quick stop. Maybe 4 aisles of groceries. Then she went to only TV dinners bc she was having problems working the stove. Eventually we were planning on moving her in but in the mean time we were taking her shopping for real foods and would stop by every week (we lived a good distance and had to get her place ready). One week we came to visit and she went straight to the hospital. She hadn\u2019t eaten anything we bought in a week. She was forgetting to eat and had a stomach ache (from inot eating). Anger and isolation is a first sign of dementia/Alzheimer\u2019s.", "NTA it is definitely a toxic situation.

Why would you make your husband lose his relationships over something like this ?", "YTA on this one. It sounds like it's not personal and \"that's just how he is\" means this is a recurring problem that might be due to cognitive issues or some other issue that has nothing to do with you. I'm not sure what you think you were standing up against when he wasn't doing anything to you personally. Getting to know each other goes both ways and you decided to cause drama instead of trying to figure out what's going on with him or why he's like that.", "YTA in that you expect a welcome, for the future FIL to be any different than he is, and for pushing the situation.

If comfortable, maybe try having more family dinners. Instead of trying to talk with the father to engage conversation, try talking to mother about yourself and your son. Maybe more updates will help engage father. \nIf father is truly TA and doesn\u2019t care to get to know or engage then maybe you consider some distance (but since he\u2019s asked the same question multiple times it kind of seems like he does want to know, he just forgets?)", "Thing to keep in mind, is his wife thinks this is how he is.

Good for your fiancee for standing up to his mother, but unless he really plans to go no contact with his parents,  you're in for many more years of this.
