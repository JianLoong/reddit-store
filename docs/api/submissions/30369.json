It wasn\u2019t, can we work this out, or is there anyway you might reconsider or even I\u2019m disappointed but understand\u2026.

He volunteered you without asking you to make points with his family.  He did not care about your feelings and needs when you told him no.  Then he tried to control and manipulate you by threatening to break up if you do not follow his command that you play at the wedding. This guy is a loser. He just showed you who he is and how little he cares about you.  You are young and risk falling into behavior that will lessen you as a human in his eyes.  He is the king and you are the servant that has no choice but to follow his orders.  So choice is yours. Be a servant or be a young woman in control of her own life.

All well and good, but the couple changed their venue at the last second from an indoor venue to a rooftop bar without telling them prior to the rehearsal. The rehearsal wasn\u2019t even at the venue. They still performed but the sound system wasn\u2019t planned very well. It\u2019s stressful to be put in that situation even in the best of conditions. It isn\u2019t always worth the stress.", "Nta - if this is his hill to die on, think of what other things he will try to coerce you into doing that you don\u2019t feel comfortable with.

What the actual fuck is that family?", "NTA, Good riddance. \u270c", "NTA - please don\u2019t let him manipulate you.", "I don\u2019t know", "NTA. People don't understand that \"playing the violin\" and \"playing the violin *for a wedding*\" are two distinct skill sets. \"Playing the violin\" and \"playing unaccompanied, *solo* violin\" also involve two completely different repertoires. \n\nA typical classical violinist learns to play either with ensembles or accompanied by a pianist; solo gigs, on the other hand, require repertoire that is geared specifically toward sounding good with no accompaniment. Learning new repertoire takes practice time unless you're at a very high level of skill that you just haven't had time to attain yet (being only 17), so not only are they asking for your already-existing skills at no cost (which is unacceptable), they're asking for *extra* time and effort on your part to learn new music.\n\nAlso, playing for a wedding requires different skills than playing in an orchestra or in solo concerts. You need to be good at adjusting on the fly to match the timing, because bridesmaids and groomsmen are notoriously bad at walking at a consistent pace. I played for my teacher's wedding as part of an ensemble of her students, and we were all inexperienced so we ended up playing the wedding march while her mom was walking in, instead of her! Everyone laughed it off because they knew we were students and it was expected that we wouldn't be experts, and it was all in good fun; but I doubt your BF's family would be similarly understanding. People who are demanding of other people's skills don't tend to understand how difficult using those skills really is, and are less tolerant of mistakes. You really don't want to put yourself in that position. \n\nAlso, it's just unacceptable to demand the use of someone's skills without paying them. Your skills are an *asset* and they are *worth money,* no matter your age. Nobody would expect you to give your possessions away for free; why should you give the labor of your own body and mind for free? You have spent *years* honing your craft (regardless of your current level of passion for it), and your skill lives *within your own body.* Don't give away your body and your time because others demand it. \n\nYour boyfriend and his family are acting incredibly entitled and ignorant, and your boyfriend has been acting incredibly manipulative as well. These are not the kind of people you want to be spending any time with; you deserve better than people who take you for granted and try to manipulate you to get what they want.", "Tell him your losing attraction to him for making ridiculous demands on you .. \ntell him to play the violin , if he isn\u2019t confident enough to learn it for the wedding then he\u2019s unattractive to you ! \nNTA", "Wow NTA!

Tell her that you're really sorry, but her brother volunteered you without talking to you first, and you're not comfortable or capable of doing it.

Why would you want to remain in a relationship with someone who would do this to you? You should tell his sister now that you never volunteered to do this and he committed you to it without ever discussing it with you and then you should break up with your boyfriend immediately. You don't need a partner in life who is not actually a partner to you but rather tries to control you to do what he wants. You would be better off without him. And the sooner his sister knows you're not doing it, the more time she has to find a replacement.", "Being asked to play music during a wedding ceremony is generally not much of a cost cutting thing as bestowing great honor and respect to the musician asked. \n\nThat said, if you truly don't think you can handle it, don't do it. But it sounds like you're just nervous. Please consider the honor being given to you. A wedding is hopefully a once in a lifetime event, and everything about it is usually very thoughtfully and carefully planned. No one asks someone to do something during the ceremony to just cut costs. That you are not even family and are being asked to be part of their ceremony is huge. It sounds like you are skilled enough to learn and play a few minutes of beautiful music and grace their wedding. You are being offered a huge gift of respect and love.
