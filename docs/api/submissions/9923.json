I didn\u2019t see anything in your post indicating you have children (which might be one reason she doesn\u2019t look for a job).

They'll whinge and cry about a marriage being a \"team\" and how dare you belittle your wife's input whilst simultaneously ignoring the fact that you are essentially carrying this team on your back while she lives life on easymode.\n\nHilariously, they are also the sort of people that, if the genders were reversed, to say that you partner was a deadbeat and needs to either shape up or you leave them.\n\nIt seems to me like this started as a marriage of relative equals, but you have progressed, and she has used this as an opportunity to leech off you.

Your wife has medical problems that are keeping her from working and you've basically written them off. On top of that, after a decade of marriage you haven't grasped the concept that you are one.

I\u2019m not sure why you haven\u2019t already.\n\nYou are taking care of an adult who won\u2019t help take care of you by getting a job. \n\nThe gift is minor. Why is all the money in a shared account? If she spends frivolously when you are a one income family that needs the money focused on bills, groceries etc\u2026 why haven\u2019t you two sat together and come up with a budget?\n\nDid you bother asking her why she got you a knife you didn\u2019t want or need?

But if you have kids\u2026. Is she contributing significantly by raising those kids? Kids who grow up with a parent at home are often mentally and socially more robust, it\u2019s a pay off many wise, or wealthy families have come to realise and are doing. Consider that her work.   \n\n\nBut YTA for judging her on this instead of talking to her maturely about money. Set a price limit for gifts for each other, and give her a list of things you like in that price range, or start a tradition of gag gifts at budget prices.

That implies that the money is shared, not owned by just you. \n\nThat said, I can understand where you're coming from. It wasn't really a shared decision to have that lifestyle - and that ranges from very unfortunate to very selfish, depending on whether she was forced into it because of her health, or if she simply decided not to work anymore without any objective reason to do so.\n\nINFO:\n\nIs her medical condition so debilitating that she really can't get any kind of job? Even do work as a freelancer? What do her doctors say? Is she actively trying to find ways to contribute to the household within the confines of her medical predicament?", "YTA for the way you responded. You\u2019re married there isn\u2019t a me and you or my money your money. She\u2019s possibly just getting a cheap gift because she already knows money is tight. You need to have a sit down and have a proper conversation about money, budgeting and agree monthly expenses so you can both spend within the agreed limits.", "YTA. When you are married, all that money is \"our\" money. Not his or hers.", "YTA. Your attitude is really crappy. There are tons of single-earners households out there, and how do you think gifts are purchased for the working partner by the stay-at-home partner? The SAH has some secret stash of money earned by some secret sideline in order to buy the gifts? No. \n\nIt's not **your** money and that is such a rude statement to make to her. That's not how it works in a single-earner household with a married couple. It's joint money that can be spent by either you or your wife. It's up to you both as a marital unit to decide how money is spent overall, how a budget will be set up, etc. This isn't the 50's where the man goes out to work and the little lady gets her pin money to spend on trinkets around the house.\n\nIf you don't want to be married to someone who cannot work (or chooses not to), then don't be.\n\nBut don't be an asshole if you choose to remain in this marriage.", "YTA. You asshole. If I treated my wife like that it would soon be divorce and rightfully so.", "Sorry to say this. But you should give her money in her own account or at her disposal.\n\nOtherwise she is totally financially dependent, which is actually some kind of abuse, depending on circumstances.\n\nWhen you both decided to be together and you agreed to care for her, this includes sharing your income at least to some degree.\n\nHow much she should have is open for discussion. But you should sit down and give her some form of financial autonomy.\n\nAfterwards you can also start helping her earn money aswell again of course.", "YTA, my guy, with how you treat her I guarantee she's only still with you because she's disabled and needs the money, your lucky she's even getting you a gift, she's trying to continue the relationship and be a good partner despite her inability to financially contribute, yet your just an unappreciative asshat and treat her like shit because your bitter about having to work when she isn't, you need therapy like 10 years ago, if you expected separate finances that should have been discussed before you married her, I recommend you get divorced, then she can at least sign up for disability and gain some financial independence from your controlling ass, y'all are supposed to be partners, her struggles are your struggles and vice versa but all you care about is keeping tally about who contributed what where", "NTA, you married a leech!", "Do her doctors feel that she can work ?  \n\nAre you saying that she stole money out of your wallet to go shopping and walked to the store to buy that paring knife ?", "YTA for not seeing that it was bought with \"our\" money. You are married and that's how it works. \n\nHowever,  I think the issue here isn't really the presents but your perceived unfairness of her not working. My now ex didn't work for many years (mental health problems) and it used to get under my skin. We'd struggle financially but I always felt he didn't try to work.\n\nThere will,  obviously,  be limitations in her ability to earn money, with her disabilities,  but I'm going to assume, from the tone of your post, that you feel she could do something,  even if it was minimal. \n\nSince only the two of you know the extent of how much her life is limited by her disabilities,  I won't try to comment on that. But,  it isn't unreasonable to be upset if you feel there is an unjustified imbalance in your finances. However,  making it about \"your\" money being spent does make you a bit of an AH. \n\nThere's also the issue of the thought going into the presents. I'm not a materialist person and don't care how much a present costs, but,  it slightly bugs me when somebody buys a presents that rather makes it feel like they didn't think about me (as the receiver), at all.  For that you're NTA. It really is the thought that counts and,  when it lacks thought,  no matter the money,  it verges on insulting/ disrespectful.\n\nEDIT: I've just gone back and read your post again... when you say \"emotional problems\" do you mean mental health issues? If you do,  then, definitely YTA. To downplay mental health issues to the point where you refer to them as \"emotional problems\" says a lot about how flippant you are about the dubbed.", "ESH. Sounds like you've repeatedly told her not to buy you gifts because they're things you don't want anyway so it's a waste of money especially if money is a bit tight. At the very least she could buy you stuff you've stated you want. But at the same time, you seem to think that your wife of 11 years is exaggerating her health issues because she's lazy and doesn't want to work, which, if not true, is pretty damn horrible of you.\n\nAnd if she is exaggerating and she's just lazy, you've chosen to live with it for a decade so I don't see the point in you choosing to stay married to someone you consistently resent for the lack of financial input to the point where you don't view the money as a partnership but as inherently yours that she needs your permission to buy things with. Sounds like you're both kind of a mess.", "YTA! \u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d???

I\u2019m sure she does stuff to contribute to the household to \u201cearn\u201d the money and isn\u2019t sitting on a couch all day demanding you feed her peeled grapes and fan her with palm leaves. If your finances are really tight enough you can\u2019t afford for her to get you gifts you guys should sit down and calmly look at the finances before the money is spent and decide together what items can be cut back. My parents budget together and had an \u201callowance\u201d for the longest time that they could spend as they pleased without needing to justify to the other. This might be a soda or lunch or new clothing. It was never a large amount but would give your wife her own money to spend if you guys can afford it. That way she can choose to get you a gift without this conflict.", "Light YTA on your comments, it was rude.

Or set a limit to how much she can take out?\n\n\nLet me level with you, Op (and anyone else reading this comment): I'm already aware these two questions are controlling, but if you honestly have that much of an issue with your wife's behavior; do something about it instead of complaining here. You clearly want her to get job, so restrict/take away her access to \"your\" money. Or at the very least, create her own bank account and deposit a bit of money into it every week/month.\n\n\nTruthfully, you both need marriage counseling asap. It's obvious you're bitter about your wife not having a job, and it's apparent it isn't healthy for anyone involved. Your wife's behavior is also a problem. She could work. It is possible to find something that won't stress her out, but after ten years of not working; why would she even bother by this point? You basically enabled her for ten years.\n\n\nIf I were to rate this, it would've easily been E S H, as you're hindering each other from doing better.

Plenty of jobs provide paid time off for depression and other r mental and physical conditions. It\u2019s just as valid to struggle to find and maintain work for those things as with anything else. She had a job and left it. Youre making up things by assuming she wasn\u2019t already struggling at her job and didn\u2019t quit to address those issues. I\u2019m not claiming that\u2019s what was happening but I\u2019m not writing it off and without OP choosing to be a decent person he won\u2019t know either. \n\n\nAnd again none of that even COVERS the likelihood that she\u2019s been handling childcare and housework the whole time anyway.", "Me: is she contributing? You: SHES NOT. \nGet over yourself", "I don\u2019t trust love languages personally lol the origin isn\u2019t ideal or based on any real facts. But I do agree the issue is communication. Someone is struggling somewhere. Maybe her \u201clove language\u201d is gifts. Maybe it\u2019d help if, if she can\u2019t work due to disabilities or what have you, to help her start a new hobby. I crochet and can make my Bf gifts for instance. It\u2019s still cost money - which would still all come down to finding a way to make things work. But it seems likely she is in charge or child care (ik he doesn\u2019t mention It here but it is relevant since he\u2019s fixated on how he makes the money her contributions matter)", "Migraines and back issues aren\u2019t excuses to not work. Those are just problems everyone has.", "You have missed my point. Unless her issues are so bad the government or another organization is going to give her disability money, she needs to be working and bringing money in.\n\n>even COVERS the likelihood that she\u2019s been handling childcare and housework\n\nYour making  massive assumptions. Nowhere does the post day they even have children. Your assuming OP isn't an equal contributor in household work, which again isn't in the post.", "If you check OPs other posts he discusses having a child with her. If she is home and he works - is she in charge of childcare and maintaining the home? Is there a fair trade off? These are my points. Which you don\u2019t seem to grasp, summer child", "No, no she doesn't. This doesn't even make sense. SSI is BEYOND DIFFICULT to get even for very disabled people (think people with cerebral palsy and it's extremely difficult to work). If she's that bad, I hope she has a diagnosis to go along with it. If not, then she needs to get one.", "Many people are seriously disabled or chronically ill but the rules around disability benefits in some countries especially when you are married and the spouse works, even when they don't earn much, mean that many people who should be getting financial help cannot. You should not assume that just because someone can't get benefits means they are fit enough to work, there are people dying in this country that can't get benefits.", "Like do you even LOOK at the people you comment on when you\u2019re on AITA or are you new here?", ">she in charge of childcare and maintaining the home? Is there a fair trade off?\n\nNowhere does it say she is, and the answer is still No its not a fair tradeoff.", "No to mention that if he makes over a certain amount of money, they won't give it to her. Because they're married, and it's - their- money as far as the government is concerned."]}
