I didn\u2019t see anything in your post indicating you have children (which might be one reason she doesn\u2019t look for a job).  So I assume she doesn\u2019t work, stays home and takes care of most of the cooking and cleaning.\n\nIf she contributes to the household in that manner, I would recommend establishing a small budget for each other, for \u201cgifts\u201d.

They'll whinge and cry about a marriage being a \"team\" and how dare you belittle your wife's input whilst simultaneously ignoring the fact that you are essentially carrying this team on your back while she lives life on easymode.\n\nHilariously, they are also the sort of people that, if the genders were reversed, to say that you partner was a deadbeat and needs to either shape up or you leave them.\n\nIt seems to me like this started as a marriage of relative equals, but you have progressed, and she has used this as an opportunity to leech off you.

Your wife has medical problems that are keeping her from working and you've basically written them off. On top of that, after a decade of marriage you haven't grasped the concept that you are one.

I\u2019m not sure why you haven\u2019t already.\n\nYou are taking care of an adult who won\u2019t help take care of you by getting a job. \n\nThe gift is minor. Why is all the money in a shared account? If she spends frivolously when you are a one income family that needs the money focused on bills, groceries etc\u2026 why haven\u2019t you two sat together and come up with a budget?\n\nDid you bother asking her why she got you a knife you didn\u2019t want or need?

But if you have kids\u2026. Is she contributing significantly by raising those kids? Kids who grow up with a parent at home are often mentally and socially more robust, it\u2019s a pay off many wise, or wealthy families have come to realise and are doing. Consider that her work.   \n\n\nBut YTA for judging her on this instead of talking to her maturely about money. Set a price limit for gifts for each other, and give her a list of things you like in that price range, or start a tradition of gag gifts at budget prices.

That implies that the money is shared, not owned by just you. \n\nThat said, I can understand where you're coming from. It wasn't really a shared decision to have that lifestyle - and that ranges from very unfortunate to very selfish, depending on whether she was forced into it because of her health, or if she simply decided not to work anymore without any objective reason to do so.\n\nINFO:\n\nIs her medical condition so debilitating that she really can't get any kind of job? Even do work as a freelancer? What do her doctors say? Is she actively trying to find ways to contribute to the household within the confines of her medical predicament?", "YTA for the way you responded. You\u2019re married there isn\u2019t a me and you or my money your money. She\u2019s possibly just getting a cheap gift because she already knows money is tight. You need to have a sit down and have a proper conversation about money, budgeting and agree monthly expenses so you can both spend within the agreed limits.", "YTA. When you are married, all that money is \"our\" money. Not his or hers.", "YTA. Your attitude is really crappy. There are tons of single-earners households out there, and how do you think gifts are purchased for the working partner by the stay-at-home partner? The SAH has some secret stash of money earned by some secret sideline in order to buy the gifts? No. \n\nIt's not **your** money and that is such a rude statement to make to her. That's not how it works in a single-earner household with a married couple. It's joint money that can be spent by either you or your wife. It's up to you both as a marital unit to decide how money is spent overall, how a budget will be set up, etc. This isn't the 50's where the man goes out to work and the little lady gets her pin money to spend on trinkets around the house.\n\nIf you don't want to be married to someone who cannot work (or chooses not to), then don't be.\n\nBut don't be an asshole if you choose to remain in this marriage.", "YTA. You asshole. If I treated my wife like that it would soon be divorce and rightfully so.", "Sorry to say this. But you should give her money in her own account or at her disposal.\n\nOtherwise she is totally financially dependent, which is actually some kind of abuse, depending on circumstances.\n\nWhen you both decided to be together and you agreed to care for her, this includes sharing your income at least to some degree.\n\nHow much she should have is open for discussion. But you should sit down and give her some form of financial autonomy.\n\nAfterwards you can also start helping her earn money aswell again of course.", "YTA, my guy, with how you treat her I guarantee she's only still with you because she's disabled and needs the money, your lucky she's even getting you a gift, she's trying to continue the relationship and be a good partner despite her inability to financially contribute, yet your just an unappreciative asshat and treat her like shit because your bitter about having to work when she isn't, you need therapy like 10 years ago, if you expected separate finances that should have been discussed before you married her, I recommend you get divorced, then she can at least sign up for disability and gain some financial independence from your controlling ass, y'all are supposed to be partners, her struggles are your struggles and vice versa but all you care about is keeping tally about who contributed what where", "NTA, you married a leech!", "Do her doctors feel that she can work ?  \n\nAre you saying that she stole money out of your wallet to go shopping and walked to the store to buy that paring knife ?", "YTA for not seeing that it was bought with \"our\" money. You are married and that's how it works. \n\nHowever,  I think the issue here isn't really the presents but your perceived unfairness of her not working. My now ex didn't work for many years (mental health problems) and it used to get under my skin. We'd struggle financially but I always felt he didn't try to work.\n\nThere will,  obviously,  be limitations in her ability to earn money, with her disabilities,  but I'm going to assume, from the tone of your post, that you feel she could do something,  even if it was minimal. \n\nSince only the two of you know the extent of how much her life is limited by her disabilities,  I won't try to comment on that. But,  it isn't unreasonable to be upset if you feel there is an unjustified imbalance in your finances. However,  making it about \"your\" money being spent does make you a bit of an AH. \n\nThere's also the issue of the thought going into the presents. I'm not a materialist person and don't care how much a present costs, but,  it slightly bugs me when somebody buys a presents that rather makes it feel like they didn't think about me (as the receiver), at all.  For that you're NTA. It really is the thought that counts and,  when it lacks thought,  no matter the money,  it verges on insulting/ disrespectful.\n\nEDIT: I've just gone back and read your post again... when you say \"emotional problems\" do you mean mental health issues? If you do,  then, definitely YTA. To downplay mental health issues to the point where you refer to them as \"emotional problems\" says a lot about how flippant you are about the dubbed.", "ESH. Sounds like you've repeatedly told her not to buy you gifts because they're things you don't want anyway so it's a waste of money especially if money is a bit tight. At the very least she could buy you stuff you've stated you want. But at the same time, you seem to think that your wife of 11 years is exaggerating her health issues because she's lazy and doesn't want to work, which, if not true, is pretty damn horrible of you.\n\nAnd if she is exaggerating and she's just lazy, you've chosen to live with it for a decade so I don't see the point in you choosing to stay married to someone you consistently resent for the lack of financial input to the point where you don't view the money as a partnership but as inherently yours that she needs your permission to buy things with. Sounds like you're both kind of a mess.", "YTA! \u201cIt\u2019s the thought that counts\u201d???

I\u2019m sure she does stuff to contribute to the household to \u201cearn\u201d the money and isn\u2019t sitting on a couch all day demanding you feed her peeled grapes and fan her with palm leaves. If your finances are really tight enough you can\u2019t afford for her to get you gifts you guys should sit down and calmly look at the finances before the money is spent and decide together what items can be cut back. My parents budget together and had an \u201callowance\u201d for the longest time that they could spend as they pleased without needing to justify to the other. This might be a soda or lunch or new clothing. It was never a large amount but would give your wife her own money to spend if you guys can afford it. That way she can choose to get you a gift without this conflict.", "Light YTA on your comments, it was rude.

Or set a limit to how much she can take out?\n\n\nLet me level with you, Op (and anyone else reading this comment): I'm already aware these two questions are controlling, but if you honestly have that much of an issue with your wife's behavior; do something about it instead of complaining here. You clearly want her to get job, so restrict/take away her access to \"your\" money. Or at the very least, create her own bank account and deposit a bit of money into it every week/month.\n\n\nTruthfully, you both need marriage counseling asap. It's obvious you're bitter about your wife not having a job, and it's apparent it isn't healthy for anyone involved. Your wife's behavior is also a problem. She could work. It is possible to find something that won't stress her out, but after ten years of not working; why would she even bother by this point? You basically enabled her for ten years.\n\n\nIf I were to rate this, it would've easily been E S H, as you're hindering each other from doing better. Do consider the counseling if you want to save your marriage. Or to maybe find out if it is worth saving at all.", "YTA", "You could have gone about that way better man YTA", "ESH.

You seem to think it's something akin to a charity donation in which the other person has no relationship to you. It's not. Gift-giving is a means of expressing love and affection toward others.

We don't do birthdays or Christmas (well, we're Jewish, so that's not saying much. Chanukah.) But not giving gifts is something we \\*mutually\\* agree on.

She should have access to a budgeted and agreed on amount of money so that she has her own money to spend on herself and you when she wants to.", "You're married so should be in a partnership, so not your money but both you and your wife's", "Why you paint that its HIS child like he is only parent in the house? Who is she, a nanny?", "He says the kid is 6, my guess is the kid is in school.", "Honestly, I don't think we have enough information about the gift to judge it. My mom gave me knives for my wedding. They're not bad gifts, and they're useful. It's reasonable for someone trying to watch their money to pick something useful. \n\nDefinitely I've seen gifts here where the giver got something for themselves and tried to pass it off as a \"gift.\" Just not enough info here.", "Bottom line is if your SO is telling you they need help with the bills and need you to figure something out you do. There are so many WFH and part time opportunities out there. If you want to help you will.", "If he divorced her how much of his money will she still expect? As an adult it's embarrassing to not help your family when asked.", "She not handicapped she\u2019s handicapable.", "Not really. The amount of opportunities in this world is very finite. Those WFH jobs everyone and their mother is applying for these days. Part time doesn't help at all if you physically can't do the job. OP is very limiting on details but you know what is a very unfortunate aspect of life? Physical ailments can compound over time. Maybe working at the mall on her feet for a while made her back issues worse. Maybe going through pregnancy and birth had severe unintended side effects. If she was already experiencing mental health issues the roller coaster that is pregnancy can really mess with that, even years later.\n\nBottom line is that if their finances are perilous they need to sit down and work together to see how to make things work.  She might not be able to do typical work but maybe she can monetize a low effort hobby or something. Maybe they can cut down on certain expenses for the time being.  But the discussion needs to include OP not just brushing off her medical issues.", "Are you with your bf? Or keep giving him allowance?", "Or maybe she can quit making excuses and get a job. Get out of here with that BS if you want to work you'll find work. There is all kinds of opportunities out there.", "Why can't she get it because she's married?", "You act like I've never had one lol", "He is from California. Clearly stated. \u201cPlaces in the world\u201d isn\u2019t really applicable here.", "So what's your disability? How severe are the symptoms? How much help and accommodation are you getting?", "It\u2019s incredibly hard to get social security disability! My husband has intractable epilepsy with severe memory issues and has had multiple brain surgeries and has been fired from multiple jobs for having seizures on the job. He has years of documentation including all his neurologists\u2019 notes (including various neurologists and neurosurgeons at NIH). He\u2019s 30 and was just denied. Unless you\u2019ve gone through applying for disability you have absolutely NO idea how difficult it really is.", "I'm actually blind in my left eye and have very bad vision in the right. I was also beat to within an inch of my life with a baseball bat so my right arm doesn't go up past my elbow and my brain doesn't always function right if I get over anxious or flustered I stutter and my mind goes blank. I did therapy for a few years and know how to calm myself down. I am a mom and wife with a family and know they need my help so I go to work everyday because that is what is needed. There is work for those who want to work. There are excuses for those who don't.", ">If they, as a couple, have over $3000 in countable assets, it does not matter how disabled she is, she cannot get SSI.\n\n\"Countable assets\" does not equate to all assets.  In fact, most assets  that the majority of people own aren't countable assets (i.e. furniture, other household goods and furnishings, a vehicle, the house you live in, etc.). \n\nIf they are having problems paying their bills, as OP is suggesting, it's likely they don't meet that threshold.  \n\nFurther, per OP she does have a working history (she used to work at the mall until she quit).  So then she would be looking into SSDI, not SSI.  SSDI is based on what you paid in, not your assets or your spouse's income.  Also, if she hasn't worked for 10 years, that's plenty of time to work through the system.  People literally do it every day.", "So you managed to do therapy to improve your situation. What if wife couldn't afford therapy to improve her set up? And how hard did you have to work to find a viable job? Do you know how many positions are available for people with disabilities? Do you have higher education or experience that allowed them to overlook the additional burdens you have?", "This, I feel like everyone is so focused on how he phrases this when really, the guy is struggling financially. It'd be nice if his wife did something to help. Maybe even encourage him to move out of Cali so they can afford life better", "It is accurate, for america, because I have talked to lawyers contesting my mother's disability rejection. I'm sorry, but actual disability lawyers trump random rejections from anon commenters on the internet.  \n\nI found out later that it's a common complaint of the disability community, that to be on disability basically requires them to stay penniless and getting married is a massive risk for loosing benefits.", "This was my ex's experience as well with SSDI. I worked our entire marriage and it was never a factor in his benefits. They never asked for my income information at all.", "LMAO you're really trying to argue this. My husband donated plasma to help pay for therapy and I sold fucken cheap jewelry and magazine subscriptions to fund it. Look if it wants to be done it will be. Period. I've had various jobs from factory to secretary (guess what I'm a felon too and have always worked full-time \ud83e\udd14). Yes I have a 2 year degree that took me 10 years to get but guess what again I wanted it so I worked for it. There are plenty of opportunities and plenty of excuses choose which works for you.", "I don't disagree. But I am not sure based on the original post if she has a definitive condition that would indicate she is chronically ill. I am also not sure that she doesn't. I was just joining in the \"it seems likely\" game where we make up new facets of the story to suit our predetermined opinions.\n\nBut, in all seriousness, you are totally correct. People with legit chronic illnesses can have a hard time just managing the day to day."]}
