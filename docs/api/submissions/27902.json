I am white British, my wife is South Asian - her parents immigrated from India but she grew up here. Darrell is, obviously, mixed race. We live in England.\n\nLike many South Asian+White mixed race kids, Darrell is quite ethnically ambiguous. Not white passing but also not immediately \"clockable\" as South Asian. Due to this, he has not faced too much racism in the past: this specific ethnic \"mix\" is relatively common in the UK anyway.\n\nAnyway, when schools opened earlier this month, I was picking Darrell up and saw that this boy, John (10M) was making \"barking noises\" at my son. I thought it was a joke, but asked Darrell why John was barking. Darrell was hesitant at first, and then cried and confessed that John had been teasing him for about a year, calling him a \"mongrel dog\" or a \"crossbreed\". He said he told the teacher twice, but the teacher assumed the dog comparison was a harmless childhood insult (aka equal to calling someone a silly goose for instance). Apparently that convinced Darrell not to speak about it again since he  (having not experienced much racism before) started thinking it was a normal term for mixed kids. He was in floods of tears, telling me he didnt like the nickname.\n\nI was furious, literally shaking. My wife and I went into the school the next day and I first gave his teacher an earful. I was not rude, but I said she was not fit to work in a multicultural classroom if she sees a mixed race kid being called a \"crossbreed\" and equated it to childish teasing. \n\nThe school's policy for disciplinary offenses is to give the child a \"punishment\" from the school (detention, no school trip, etc) AND phone the child's parents. Me and my wife were called into a meeting with John's dad. Soon I realised where John gets his racism from: his dad is, if you're British, the archetypal Essex \"Baz\". Throws slurs around, a \"luv the troops hate me missus hate foreigners\" type. There was no convincing him, and he let us know he would not punish John. Ok - his choice.\n\nHowever the SCHOOL also refused to give John a punishment - because apparently they did not want to step on the parents toes. Which was insane to me: normally, parents aren't asked for \"permission\" to punish their children for talking in class or skipping PE so why would this be any different? I told them I would escalate this throigh my MP if they did not give John a school punishment. \n\nI'm not asking for him to be beaten in the streets - but at LEAST a perfunctory detention? Everyone we asked have been divided on the topic: some agree with me, but others say I'm \"cruel\" and \"delighting in a child being punished\", and even accused of trying to make the teacher lose her job if I escalate this. \n\nAITA? I don't want to see the other kid harmed, obviously, he's a kid - but I feel like skipping punishment just because his dad is racist - that is setting a horrible precedent for both John and Darrell. But am I being mean spirited?\n\nEdit to add: me leading the \"vanguard\" on this and not my wife is not because I don't trust her to fight \"her own\" battles but rather due to her agreeing that it would be taken more seriously coming from me (as the white partner) and that she would probably be seen as \"over reacting\". In addition, it's not like I have nothing to do with it: an insult to my son is not my wife's fault or \"battle\", and has everything to do with me as well.", "created_utc": 1696030876, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16vrb5t/aita_for_insisting_a_boy_in_my_sons_class_be/", "score": 75, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The right thing to do is to give him a chance to properly integrate into society. The time to train that is now during his formation years. It would be an injustice to the bully if he were not given the chance to learn proper conduct. Whether he will want to act properly as he grows older and once he becomes an adult is another matter.
