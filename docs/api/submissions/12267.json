I load them up in the canopy in the back of my ute and pop the one window of canopy into the open position so my dogs can look at things and get some fresh air. The gas struts of the window have failed (meaning the window no longer supports itself while open and drops down) so I wrap a strap around the inner strut to act as support so the window doesnt drop down and close while going over bumps.\n\nI did the same thing that afternoon, but after getting home and dropping the dogs off, I needed to pop into the shops. Problem was I forgot that I had left the canopy window open while driving to the shops. \n\nOn my way there some bloke got out of his car at a set of traffic lights and runs over to my truck and attempts to close the canopy window down for me. But because I braced it so well, he had to put extra force into trying to close it (I watched this all unfold in the mirror - it happened extremely fast so I had no opportunity to tell him to stop). He put so much force into trying to close it for me that he completely shattered the window. The light went green so we pulled over on the other side of the intersection. I got his details from him, he\u2019s 20 years old, driving an old four wheel drive. Really nice kid. \n\nBut am I the asshole for making an insurance claim to have the canopy replaced (it was an older canopy so they could not make repairs). I do feel bad that he was only trying to help out but in the same breath I was left with problem I never created. \n\nShould I have copped it on the chin? I left the window open mistakenly. He was just trying to be a good samaritan and was extremely apologetic about it. He actually went back and cleaned glass off the road with a broom. He also cut his feet on the glass.\n\nEdit: some people saying im taking advantage of the situation which is not true. I asked insurance to repair the old canopy. The manufacturer came back and said it cant be replaced because the model was no longer supported and had been superseded - so the whole canopy must be replaced under the insurance claim.", "created_utc": 1678796747, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11r4qjd/aita_for_making_an_insurance_claim_against/", "score": 3912, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He was trying to help but fucked it up even more. It wasn't 'already broken' like people seem to think, the glass was fine and you were making due with what you had available. Until he 'helped' you the repair would have been cheap and easy, but now it's complicated with shattered glass in and outside the car. All these people saying you're taking advantage of him are crazy, it went from something quick and cheap to expensive and tedious. But as usual reddit can't read. NTA all the way", "NTA\n\nMy question is: Why did this 20 year old guy feel compelled to get out of his vehicle, come over to your vehicle, and attempt to close the canopy window for you? If I was stopped at a traffic light, and I saw someone's window opened as you describe,  I would mind my own business, and stay in my vehicle. Alternately, if I was in your position, and I saw someone fiddling with with my vehicle's window (while I was still in the vehicle), then I would assume that the other person was up to no good.\n\nEither way, I think that the other person is the AH in this case. Maybe this will teach him to mind his own business, and to not touch other people's property without permission.", "NTA\n\nHe shouldn't have touched your vehicle. There was no expectation for him to do so and his actions caused the damage. Unfortunately for him you shouldn't be stuck with the bill.", "I say NTA.  There's a reason they say the road to hell is paved with good intentions.  He may have intended to be nice, but the reality is he just came and broke your canopy out of nowhere.  That was his decision, this is his fault and these are his consequences to deal with.\n\nIf you want to be nice, maybe there's an option to try to work with him directly instead of going through insurance.  But he owes you for what he broke.", "NTA. If he was just trying to help, it seems like he would have told you \"Hey, this window is open\" instead of trying to do something to your car without your permission. This is a great opportunity for this kid to learn about boundaries.", "YTA.  Not sure how it works where you live (guessing APAC?) but here in the States, the maximum you'd be able to recover would be the value of the damaged part, not a replacement, because your canopy was in poor condition to begin with.  \n\nA new, basic,  soft-sided canopy costs about $1000 in the US, but what the fella broke wasn't a new canopy; it was a really old one. So let's say that's worth $500. But he didn't break the whole thing, just the flap or the window, one of those parts.  An American court would award you maybe $250.  \n\nSo you're asking if you should create a ton of hassle for this guy who was just trying to help you and who had no way of knowing that your canopy was broken, just so you can get $250?  Yeah, you would be a major asshole for that.\n\nBTW you could have prevented this if instead of \"watching this all unfold in the mirror\" you had just yelled \"Hey thanks for helping but that's broken and I'm ok with it for now!\"   So this is really largely your fault.", "I love being early to posts like this.

(depends on local laws, but most places have laws about this) \n\n2.Have you gone to a GLASS shop to see if they can replace it? Not a car dealer or a body shop, a shop that ONLY does glass?\n\nI've had a local glass company make custom side panels for computers for me, got a quote to replace a flat top panel with a bubble panel, and had them fix/replace windshields for me. They even sourced new struts for an old jeep hard top for me for less money than buying the struts from a junk yard.", "NTA for going to your insurance to try and get what he broke fixed. He broke the glass and had no business touching anything on your car without permission. If you try to get more out of him than what he broke, you would be the asshole.

He made a bizarre choice and whilst he sounds like a nice guy in apologizing and clearing the glass, ultimately he needs to learn some common sense, because it doesn't sound like it was applied here.\n\nIdeally I would ask if he wants to pay for it before going through any sort of insurance, but in some way he should be paying for it.", "I'm honestly torn. \n\nAt the same time:\n\n> I was left with problem I never created.\n\nYou absolutely did create this problem by leaving the window propped open. That window could have led to other issues and shattered on its own. \n\nI don't think you're wrong for filing a claim -- nor do I think the act of filing a claim makes you an AH. Indeed, I think filing a claim is the normal, natural response in a situation like this. But I also don't think he's an AH for trying to help (although making you aware of the issue would have been a far, far better alternative). But I do get AH vibes from you for your attitude here -- you did ultimately cause the problem in the first place. He just made it worse. \n\nI guess I'm going to go with NAH. You should have fixed your window or ensured it was down before you started driving (because surely you realize that driving with it like that was a safety hazard?). And he should have checked with you before messing with it even though he had the very best of intentions. But at the end of the day, neither of you were behaving as actual AHs. Just normal people doing normal people things.\n\nLet insurance figure it out. And be more careful next time.", "Yta- the kid broke the glass of your window, not the whole canopy.

They had no right and shouldn't have touched your vehicle! Of course you are going to go through insurance - that's what it's there for - unforeseen events where strangers cause damage to your property.  \nI agree with others that if you can sort it out with the young man and he can pay the damages without getting insurance involved then that would be the best outcome but that might not be feasible. If he deals with you in good faith then perhaps you might chip in a bit knowing that some work needed done anyway but that's beside the point.

While  the standards are probably a bit different in civil court, the actions that this person took were not reasonably expected to cause damage to a canopy in proper working condition, and without you to tell him otherwise, he wouldn't suspect your canopy wasn't in proper working condition. You (or your insurance company) might have a hard time getting a court to find this guy responsible at all, given that he was attempting to close a window in a manner it is normally closed and he couldn't foresee that you had altered its ability to move.\n\nWhich is all just a very long way of saying you set this in motion by #1 not fixing your window in the first place #2 not closing it before going driving and #3 not saying anything to the person who was trying to help you; your recovery amount will be low due to the age/condition of the canopy and your role in the incident; and you'd be an ass to create such a big problem for someone over such a small amount of money.", "I\u2019m goi g to take a guess from context that you\u2019re in a more rural area?\n\nI think it would be helpful here to consider the broader context here. You\u2019ve said the canopy needs to be closed to protect your equipment.

He\u2019s afraid of helping again because he got burned the last time. So instead of helping he keeps walking. \n\nFurthermore, he tells his family and friends in the community what has happened and they start pausing, afraid something like that will happen to them if they stop and help. Some will choose to help anyway.

Let him know that it was his mistake, let him know the cost and ask what he can contribute towards a new canopy.

Do you know how expensive the proper glass is if those parts aren\u2019t made anymore?

It\u2019s absolutely ridiculous, but welcome to insurance. Therefore, if this is a similar case, it\u2019s likely more cost effective for the insurance provider to replace the canopy itself.\n\nEdit: PS, even if it is just the glass, the glass will still be expensive to replace. Glass prices shot up exponentially over the last few years due to a combo of increased demand (hello fancy COVID barriers worldwide), decreased supply, and increased shipping costs. It\u2019s not a cheap repair anymore, if done correctly. Regardless of whether the struts worked or not, the glass was intact.\n\nLet this be a lesson to all of us to a) remain IN your vehicles at stoplights, b) don\u2019t mess with other people\u2019s vehicles or property if there isn\u2019t a serious risk of danger at hand, and c) be more observant.

You never asked for his help.", "Where I grew up, you do NOT touch other people's vehicles. That's what tweakers do when they're going to rob you, and it's a really good way to get shot.", "Who cares you\u2019re supposed to let someone know about damage or something being open not try to fix it for them.", "Why are you assuming everyone replying to you is a woman lmao? And that they all prefer men never help them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDude should learn to \\*think\\* before \\*acting\\* if the unsolicited help he is giving is really necessary at all. Some ppl like getting help, some people don't, might be worth asking a person if they want help first in many situations (including this one!! Wave the gosh darned driver down lol)", "\u2026. He shattered OPs window, what was a cheap fix that was for the time actually still working with what OP had set up, is now a much more expensive endeavour and caused multiple problems now. \n\nIf what the guy did broke the struts and that\u2019s it you have a point. But they shattered the fucking window. That\u2019s fucked. \n\nHow would you like it if you had a slight scratch on your phone screen that you had dealt with but not fully fixed, and some stranger sees it grabs your phone off the table as they can fix it for you but then drops and shatters your phone screen? You would be pissed even though they tried to do right they made the situation 100x worse when literally no one asked them for their help.", "The use of the word \u201cute\u201d and \u201cbloke\u201d makes me think he\u2019s an Australian/Kiwi or from UK where this 100% not a concern", "However, the repair needed didn't change", "I think it depends on what the intent of the hit was. If they were striking with real force, i.e. a punch, but just thought they would hurt rather than kill, then yeah, the charges are warranted. If I were a prosecutor I'd probably plead them down lower though since the intent was likely so far from the result.\n\nIf it was something that happened in the act of play-fighting/rough-housing, then I don't think charges really serve any sort of justice. I wouldn't think that sort of hit would be lethal even with the added lack-of-care that alcohol brings to the table, but this *is* a story about someone hitting someone just wrong and shockingly killing them, so seems plausible.", "The repair needed absolutely changed, previously the repair was on the struts and manageable, he could have it open or closed. Now the repair is for the whole window and is no longer manageable, there will be sharp edges around the frame which is a safety issue for his dogs and he can no longer use it for its intended purpose which is to pretext the interior from the elements. You could potentially make the argument that the only repair *available* hasn't changed, but his ability to utilize it without the repair has."]}
