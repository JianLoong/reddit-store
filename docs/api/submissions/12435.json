He tried to reach out after that, but his dad completely ignored him and wanted nothing to do with him. My boyfriend was really depressed about it, but he eventually got over it. I remember one night we all got drunk (we're apartment sharing with friends) and he told us that he was dead to his father, and that stuck with me.\n\nYesterday, he just showed up, my boyfriend's dad, that is. Myself and one of our roommates were the only people home. I answered the door, but I didn't let him in. He said he wanted to talk to his son and I said \"oh, your dead son?\" He must not have remembered or understood the reference, because he went completely pale and asked how/when he died. He looked almost as upset as my boyfriend had been, so I decided to let him stew in it.\n\nI told him a fake story. He looked like he was going to throw up, and he asked if he could come in and have some water. I reluctantly let him, because he seemed very ill. Once inside, my roommate saw us and asked what was going on. My boyfriend's dad asked if he knew his son, and my roommate was super confused and it quickly came out that my boyfriend wasn't actually dead.\n\nMy boyfriend's dad was furious. He said I was a sick person with a hateful heart. I told him he said his son was dead to him, so why would he even care. He said he made a mistake in a moment of anger, but I made a cold-blooded decision. My roommate also said that what I did was fucked up.\n\nI went to our room and called my boyfriend, who said to make sure his dad left before he came home, which I did, and he did, reluctantly. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the dead thing, just that he showed up and seemed to regret things. My boyfriend is shocked by his dad just showing up and I don't want to pile more on. My roommate said I was a huge asshole because \"no one deserves that,\" but I'm not sure. He did look so sick, but part of me thinks he brought it all upon himself. I don't know.\n\nEdit: One of you made a compelling case to tell my boyfriend as soon as possible about telling his dad he was dead. He wanted to know what his dad's reaction was and kept asking if he said anything other than asking for more information before he found out it was a lie. He only really asked questions like \"When? How? Was it sudden?\" and such, and my boyfriend was pretty disappointed by that. He's pretty depressed this morning.", "created_utc": 1678973857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11suf3t/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriends_dad_he_was_dead/", "score": 2062, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What you said was messed up and going too far but I have seen some of your comments and there is no denying that the dad is an asshole as well. You said that your boyfriend is turning 19 next month, so it has been 11 months since he tried to speak to his son, who may not be a child but is still a teenager nonetheless. If it had been just a \"mistake\" in a moment of anger it wouldn't have taken *this* long to get over it and make amends, assuming that is even what he was trying to do. Probably gonna get banned or downvoted to hell for saying this, but this is the first time I have seen this subreddit be so chilled out about a parent abandoning their child. \n\nNow that I have seen your comment about how the reason he told his son he was dead to him was because he didn't want to go to college, I feel even more strongly that he is also an asshole in this. That is... NOT a valid reason for disowning his teenage son. (I'm willing to back you up on that despite having been raised to value education and currently planning to go to university next year.) People who think otherwise must either be well into their 20s or younger than 17 who think that all 18 year olds should be naturally capable of and wanting to fend for themselves. They don't know what it is like to be an 18 year old who missed a year of their childhood and many opportunities we should have got for brain development and gaining independence due to covid. \n\nActually, his dad was probably more of an asshole for disowning his son at such a young age than you were for this. But that being said, despite my more sympathetic tone throughout, you still shouldn't have done that. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.", "I'm willing to bet that's because the BF hasn't actually gotten the complete story.", "Piss off", "I'm honestly shocked it's not already a thing.", "I just can\u2019t understand how anyone thinks she\u2019s the asshole.", ">I think that's true of most people\n\nMost people wouldn't tell someone that their son is dead when they're not.  You don't get to include yourself in with what \"most people\" consider acceptable behavior.", "This is weird to you, but lying about your boyfriend being dead is just fine and dandy? You really are a psycho.", "who cares what gender, if that is what you are referring to?  Bottom line - YTA here and quit sidelining.   Own up to shitting on your bf and his dad's relationship by what you did.   What an absolute horrible thing to do to his dad you vindictive beeatch.", "Congratulations you\u2019ve won the biggest YTA in this entire subreddit ever. Can we have the mod find out OP\u2019s address and maybe we can crowd fund a trophy for em and send it over.", "Yta, you had no right to do that unless your bf specifically told you too. Him saying that he's dead to him does nothing to indicate that you should convince his father that he's dead. People have their own thing about how they want to handle their parents, if you respect him, you would do what he wants in this situation. Not what you think or want. Also even then, that's a sincerely messed up thing to do to someone.", "Stay out of family issues", "YTA! What is wrong with you?", "Yikes!\n\nYTA\n\nI remember when the police came round and told us my brother was dead.  I wouldn't wish that ground swallowing feeling on anyone. Seriously.", "YTA what you did was so cruel. I am kinda speechless actually. I get you might really despise someone but you should not do that to anyone. It\u2019s not your father and not your decision to make. You should have taken his details and passed them to your bf and then how he chose to proceed was up to him.", "damn, I\u2019m all in for petty revenge and all but this is just straight up cruel\n\nwhat if that man had a heart attack after hearing such heartbreaking news?will YOU be able to live with it? The fact the you obliviously killed someone with fake info?\nDon\u2019t pull such stunts which might put people\u2019s health on risk .death isn\u2019t the topic to be petty about.\n\nedit: YTA , a huge one .", "YTA. There is nothing on earth like the death of a child. A symbolic death, like your BF claimed from his father, is not the same because the parent still knows that the child is living. You were heartless and cruel. They may get together at some point in the future - no one knows. But your evil actions will dwell in their minds for a long time.", "Oh for fucks sake.\n\nOf course YTA, and his father didn't say he was dead to him, your drunk boyfriend said that.\n\nThis does sound kind of made up because I just don't think people are this dumb in real life.", "Weelllll, that was kinda an AH thing to do but I get where you are coming from.   Unfortunately, now you will never know if the dad came to try and make amends or wanted something.   Guess, since your BF doesn\u2019t want to see his dad, it doesn\u2019t matter.  Oh, and you have a hateful heart?    Sounds like the dad is projecting a bit there.", "YTA (major one)! Your boyfriend is also the AH. You guys seem young and clueless! The fact that you said that to his Dad, then went along with it says a lot about you. Rather your bf supports that or not. You are a sick person.", "I used to say the same thing, but then I found out about /r/AITAFiltered so it does matter under some circumstances.", "Confused as to where you got she from", "Lol love it. Post this", "Your username suits you. Not a good friend (partner) or person.", "She told her boyfriends father that his son passed away. The man could have had a heart attack or worse killed himself", "Sounds like he deserved it", "Agreed. I'm no contact with my father. When we see each other at stuff like my niece's birthday party, I'm willing to have a bland conversation with him, like I'd make polite small talk with, say, their neighbour if they invited him or something. If he tries to get personal, I just turn away. I don't even feel upset anymore. \n\nHe alienated me so deeply and consistently, our relationship doesn't exist anymore and we're basically strangers."]}
