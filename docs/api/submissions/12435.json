He tried to reach out after that, but his dad completely ignored him and wanted nothing to do with him. My boyfriend was really depressed about it, but he eventually got over it. I remember one night we all got drunk (we're apartment sharing with friends) and he told us that he was dead to his father, and that stuck with me.\n\nYesterday, he just showed up, my boyfriend's dad, that is. Myself and one of our roommates were the only people home. I answered the door, but I didn't let him in. He said he wanted to talk to his son and I said \"oh, your dead son?\" He must not have remembered or understood the reference, because he went completely pale and asked how/when he died. He looked almost as upset as my boyfriend had been, so I decided to let him stew in it.\n\nI told him a fake story. He looked like he was going to throw up, and he asked if he could come in and have some water. I reluctantly let him, because he seemed very ill. Once inside, my roommate saw us and asked what was going on. My boyfriend's dad asked if he knew his son, and my roommate was super confused and it quickly came out that my boyfriend wasn't actually dead.\n\nMy boyfriend's dad was furious. He said I was a sick person with a hateful heart. I told him he said his son was dead to him, so why would he even care. He said he made a mistake in a moment of anger, but I made a cold-blooded decision. My roommate also said that what I did was fucked up.\n\nI went to our room and called my boyfriend, who said to make sure his dad left before he came home, which I did, and he did, reluctantly. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the dead thing, just that he showed up and seemed to regret things. My boyfriend is shocked by his dad just showing up and I don't want to pile more on. My roommate said I was a huge asshole because \"no one deserves that,\" but I'm not sure. He did look so sick, but part of me thinks he brought it all upon himself.

They had a huge blowup and perhaps the relationship is over, but you never know if they can eventually repair it, perhaps the dad was coming to apologize (now or even later) and make amends and you just stomped all over it, first potentially forever having him think his son was gone and then by lying to him about being dead.  You should have just stayed out of it and only said your BF doesn't want to talk to him and then let your BF handle how he takes it from there.  \n\n He needs to know the truth of what happened here and you need to apologize to both him AND his dad.\n\nI hope your BF makes you an ex shortly for this.", "YRA. You for took it too far. You should have corrected the misunderstanding, not continued it by making up a story, told him to leave and never show up announced again, and told your boyfriend what happened and allowed him to make the decision for himself.

But in the larger context a parent telling their child that \u201cyou\u2019re dead to me\u201d is also horrific and if we\u2019re adding a dose of homophobia to that, dad\u2019s also an AH.\n\nEDIT: I\u2019m relieved that this wasn\u2019t a homophobia issue at least.
