He tried to reach out after that, but his dad completely ignored him and wanted nothing to do with him. My boyfriend was really depressed about it, but he eventually got over it. I remember one night we all got drunk (we're apartment sharing with friends) and he told us that he was dead to his father, and that stuck with me.\n\nYesterday, he just showed up, my boyfriend's dad, that is. Myself and one of our roommates were the only people home. I answered the door, but I didn't let him in. He said he wanted to talk to his son and I said \"oh, your dead son?\" He must not have remembered or understood the reference, because he went completely pale and asked how/when he died. He looked almost as upset as my boyfriend had been, so I decided to let him stew in it.\n\nI told him a fake story. He looked like he was going to throw up, and he asked if he could come in and have some water. I reluctantly let him, because he seemed very ill. Once inside, my roommate saw us and asked what was going on. My boyfriend's dad asked if he knew his son, and my roommate was super confused and it quickly came out that my boyfriend wasn't actually dead.\n\nMy boyfriend's dad was furious. He said I was a sick person with a hateful heart. I told him he said his son was dead to him, so why would he even care. He said he made a mistake in a moment of anger, but I made a cold-blooded decision. My roommate also said that what I did was fucked up.\n\nI went to our room and called my boyfriend, who said to make sure his dad left before he came home, which I did, and he did, reluctantly. I didn't tell my boyfriend about the dead thing, just that he showed up and seemed to regret things. My boyfriend is shocked by his dad just showing up and I don't want to pile more on. My roommate said I was a huge asshole because \"no one deserves that,\" but I'm not sure. He did look so sick, but part of me thinks he brought it all upon himself. I don't know.\n\nEdit: One of you made a compelling case to tell my boyfriend as soon as possible about telling his dad he was dead. He wanted to know what his dad's reaction was and kept asking if he said anything other than asking for more information before he found out it was a lie. He only really asked questions like \"When? How? Was it sudden?\" and such, and my boyfriend was pretty disappointed by that. He's pretty depressed this morning.", "created_utc": 1678973857, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11suf3t/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriends_dad_he_was_dead/", "score": 245, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

With the family disowning the bf at 18 and him being dead to them reads as a gay thing to me. And I'd expect another gay man to get that and be more enraged having seen their partners hurt, it's a very specific type of being excluded when it's your sexuality. Op was still an asshole and I wouldn't act like that now, but just around 20 and only shortly into the hurt yeah I could see why someone immature would be spiteful. I doubt dad's 30 seconds of heavy regret and sickness feelings even scratch what the son felt. Its petty and childish but wouldn't lose much sleep.\n\nThis of course could also be an entire fabrication and misunderstanding of the circumstances and maybe it isn't a disowned for being gay thing. Just reads thar way from the rather unhinged responses in comments but trying to put together. \n\nPersonally this is how my partner would treat my dad if they showed up, with extreme hostility and lack of compassion. But they'd be entirely right to do so as well as knowing I'd be fine with it. Which is maybe half right from ops bfs reaction and just wanting the dad gone.

When you came to the door I was commenting on how your son was dead to you.

Just that I understand where more malicious intentions come from, i can see a 21 year old gay person projecting their own traumas into actions as well as something that effected someone they cared about.
