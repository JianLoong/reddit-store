I was always closest with my father never my mother. After he died my relationship with my mother was strained. I felt like I had lost two parents because she always treated me different. My brother would tell me it's bc I remind her too much of dad. I make a lot of money in my career so l'm pretty well off. I bought her a new house only because my sister & her children lived there. I took a 23 and me test recently and the results didn\u2019t make sense. My father is white, my mother is Pacific Islander and white. My ancestry came back as 60% Pacific Islander, 24%white, and 15% west African, and 1%other. If my father is a fully white man, then how would I only have 24% white dna?\n\nI didn't confront my mother yet because I wanted to find out first if this was legit. I received a message on 23 & me of a family member trying to reach out. We shared 23.97% dna and he was my half brother. I got in contact with him & found out he's 17, and lives in Hawaii with his father who is black and Pacific Islander, and has cancer. I went to go meet him them, and they were the nicest people I've ever met. I felt that I had missed out on so much, and they wanted to be a part of my life. His dad confirmed that he was in a relationship with my mother in 1998. My parents had apparently gone through a small separation that I had no idea about. He said she told him she was pregnant & wanted an abortion and was going back to my dad. He gave her money for an abortion & they parted ways and never saw eachother again. Well I wasn't aborted, so she took his money and lied. I went to confront my mother about it. I asked her if my dad was actually my father, and with zero emotion said \"no\". I was absolutely heartbroken & felt so completely lost. I understood why she never liked me and it was because I was her secret love child. She said my dad wanted to raise me as his own. I have spent 11 years without a father when there's been another one out there this whole time. And now he's battling cancer so I could potentially have 2 dead fathers. She didn't even seem remorseful to have lied to me for my whole life. She denied me of a relationship with a father knowing that's all I've ever wanted. I wrote her a check for $20,000 & told her to never speak to me or my family again.\n\nMy brother, who basically licks my moms ass, was very upset with me for that. He among other family members believe I am acting too harsh and that she is my mother & I should forgive her. I have had other mother figures in my life that treated me 100 times better than my mom ever did. She kicked me out in high school & my friends mother took me in. The only one who thinks I am not over-reacting is my sister and my boyfriend. I've been hearing from family members who I haven't even spoke to in years, telling me that I'm a terrible child for what I did.\n\nSo am I the asshole? Am I over reacting?\n\nEdit: she just cashed the check so we\u2019ll see if there\u2019s no contact", "created_utc": 1680386062, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129063t/aita_for_writing_my_mom_a_20000_check_to_never/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
