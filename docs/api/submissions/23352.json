Been together 5 years, lived together 4. He\u2019s been in his undergrad this whole time because he changed schools and degrees multiple times and has failed classes and had to retake. I\u2019ve been a software engineer for three years and bought a house a year ago. He does not pay the mortgage or utilities, he just occasionally throws me about $500 whenever his dad gives him money. Not every month. I also pay almost all of our food expenses and the expenses for both of our cats. He had one job for 3 months in the last 5 years but that was it. He cannot handle alcohol. He had a sober year in 2021 to see if he could do it but that was it. Almost every time he drinks he binges and throws up before he\u2019s even that drunk.\n\nLast night was the second of two times in my house he had vomited NOT in a trash can or toilet. First time was in our bedroom. I did most of the cleaning then since he was too drunk. He ruined our mattress topper and never replaced it. This time I was not home because I had to perform in a show and he was being a drunk jerk as we were pulling out of the driveway so I told him to get out and he stayed home. When I got home at midnight the living room smelled like alcohol. He called me twice on the way home, never mentioned he vomited. \n\nHe says he spilled a drink but cleaned it up. I look on the ground and see splash marks reaching all the way from the couch to the TV. I look at him and say \u201cOh my god you vomited didn\u2019t you?\u201d Then I got some spray and started spraying everywhere I saw these. He was obviously not too drunk to clean so I threw the paper towels at him and told him to wipe up and I went to bed. I woke up this morning to finding more splatter in the room that were too hard to see without natural light. I had to tell him to clean again more thoroughly and which cleaners to use on which surfaces because I knew if I did not then he could ruin the floors or the leather or the suede foot rest. \n\nThis may be the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back but I\u2019m feeling done. I don\u2019t want to live with him anymore. Not saying we need to break up but he needs to find a place if his own if he\u2019s going to do this. The bare minimum is that you don\u2019t drunk projectile vomit twice in one year in a home you don\u2019t even pay rent in and don\u2019t know how to clean. But he\u2019s making me feel like I\u2019m overreacting or being too hard on him.

If that were the real reason, he might be right. But from your post, that isn\u2019t the reason at all and is just another incident that has propelled you to this decision. \n\nFrom literally your second line I thought \u201cthis isn\u2019t about the vomiting\u201d, and it isn\u2019t. You are obviously and understandably sick and tired of his immature behaviour and you having to parent him. You\u2019re living an adult life, and he\u2019s living a student life. That\u2019s fine, but it means you\u2019re not compatible. \n\nPlease know you don\u2019t need permission or a \u201cgood enough\u201d reason to break up with someone, or have them move out of your home. The fact you want to is enough. \n\nNTA. Get him out and go live your best life. This guy isn\u2019t helping you, he\u2019s hindering you.", "Honestly getting sick before you get black out drunk is a blessing and has saved lives but someday he will likely get over it and *really* start having problems with alcohol.\n\nNTA for not wanting to deal with your forever Freshman boyfriend (even how he handles alcohol is like time stopped Freshman year lol) when you've moved on with your life from college.", "NTA - this is your home, hes a crap BF, pretty much an alcoholic (drinking to the point of blacking out) \n\nDump him and move on girl. Youre better off.", "I suspect that by the time you had written all this out you yourself recognized that the projectile vomiting is not the reason you need to break up with him. Even without the alcohol, he\u2019s a bad partner to you and a bad person in general. Assholiness doesn\u2019t really enter into the equation here; you\u2019re an adult and he\u2019s not. You can do much better, and he needs to learn the lesson that comes of you dumping him and moving on to someone much better.", "You didn\u2019t say you need to break up. But I am. Break up.\n\nThere are way too many other people in the world for people to put up with this type of nonsense.", "YWNBTA for kicking him out or ending things frankly, but why in the world are you with someone who has been living off you for years, doesn't work, can't finish school, and clearly has a drinking problem?   \n\n\nAre your options so bad, even though you work as a software engineer, own your own home, and sound like you have your act together? Wouldn't being single be better than this? I hope you can do some real reflection on why you want to stay in this relationship", "NTA\n\nYou don't like him, and frankly nobody would. Of course you should dump him. Think of how much better your life will be without a drunk throwing up around you, being a jerk, and ruining your thinggs.", "NTA.  \n\nAlthough it seems like it would be tough to continue the relationship if you did kick him out, so you may want to consider the full consequences of your decision.", "YWNBTA, he sounds like he has serious problems and needs to get sober and stay that way. In the meantime you shouldt have to put up with him vomiting in your house", "NTA. You shouldn't have to parent your significant other. This is only thr beginning of what he will put you through", "NTA\n\nBut why are you not breaking up with him?", "NTA \n\nYes you need to throw him out, out of your life.\n\nThis guy doesn't work, rarely contributes to your living expenses and has no apparent goal in life other than to drink. He doesn't need a career. He needs a job. The fact that he didn't drink for a year does not negate he is an alcoholic. His dad gives him money to keep him out of his house because he doesn't want him either. \n\nHe's even doing a piss poor job of making you happy. Who gets drunk before going to a partner's event?", "Ugh. You\u2019re living with a frat bro. \n\nNTA. Kick him out to his dad\u2019s house.", "NTA\n\nHe can't act in a way that respeczs you or your property and you end up having to fix his mess. Absolutely kick him out.", "NTA, and you should be single asap!", "**YWNBTA** to ***oust the oaf***.", "NTA but keep the cats. They don't deserve to live with an alcoholic either.", "**NTA** if you make him face some long overdue consequences.\n\nHowever, you are an AH towards yourself if you  let this going on and happen again. **Your bf is an addict and you are an enabler.** Is this really what you want from life? If he gets his shit together and starts adulting, great. But what if he just keeps floating and mooching, taking you and your home for granted? \n\nYou shouldn't lit yourself to fire to keep him warm.", "NTA. The vomit is not the issue here. Everyone is sick, sometimes you can't make it to the toilet. He is lazy, he is using you and he is disrespectful of your home when you let him live there for free. He is taking you for a ride.", "NTA but why are you babysitting him", "NTA. You've been supporting him for too long as it is and you deserve to be free. For not paying any bills, he should have been doing the majority of the cleaning/chores. \n\nA lot of us (me included) have to learn lessons the hard way. Please don't let yourself be taken advantage of again. You deserve better.", "And you\u2019re staying with him, why?", "NTA. Don't live your life with an alcoholic loser that can't even clean up after themselves. \n\nYou are not required to adopt and raise a grown man.", "Dude he\u2019s using you. Dump his ass. NTA", "YTA\n\nFor not leaving this child 5 years ago.", "NTA, you should dump his ass just for the first paragraph.", "Nta. But you will be if you don\u2019t break up with him. He didn\u2019t grow up. You are caring for a child. A drunk child who doesn\u2019t learn, clean or work. He\u2019s an alcoholic who won\u2019t work bc he doesn\u2019t need to. Mommy takes care of him. Mommy pays his bills. Mommy cooks his food. Mommy is being used. Mommy needs to find someone else.", "NTA, but the vomit is not the main issue here. \n\nYour boyfriend is an active alcoholic. He was too drunk to go with you to a pre planned event, an event you were performing in and had to deal with him before going to it. Oh and then of course he wasn't there to support you, and added to your stress before doing it. \n\nHe is also a jerk when drunk, so you have to deal with him being rude and sounds like verbally abusive. \n\nAnd he hasn't had a job in 5 years and you have to support him, and nothing in your post indicates that he has any plans to change that. \n\nAnd then he pukes. \n\nSeriously, you are 26 years old. Why are you settling for a man with no ambition, little to no respect for you, and no change in sight? Think of what you can do with all the money you spend on him? Early retirement, going on vacation, remodeling your home, buying a new car (certainly you need a new mattress)- you are wasting your life and money on this dude. Get him out of your home ASAP.", "No. Absolutely say you need to break up. \nHe hasn\u2019t hit bottom yet. I\u2019m afraid this is not going to get better anytime soon. \nThe problem is not the alcohol. He is a bad partner first and foremost. He doesn\u2019t have any respect for you or your relationship. It\u2019s time for you to move on. NTA", "NTA\n\nUr bf sounds like a bad alcoholic.\nTbh he also seems like a dead beat but if that's what you like.", "Why are you putting up with this?  Kick him out, he is a moocher and alcoholic.", "Nta. \n\nGet rid of the hobo sexual.", "NTA. But YWBTA to yourself if you stayed with him. What does he add to your life? Anything beyond vomit, expenses and hassle?", "NTA. But honestly? If you stay with this man, YTA. Or more accurate, YTE. You're The Enabler. He's mooching off of you and he's letting alcohol consume his life. if you're taking care of his every living expense, exactly what will ever cause him to decide to get better? Because alcohol only makes a person worse as it destroys their body and brain.   \n\n\nYou say you're feeling done. Please, OP, for your own sake, trust that feeling, because it is the right one. this man will never get better under your roof, he will only be your alcoholic pet. Cut ties. It's over.", "NTA. Dump him. He needs to get his life together", "NTA for kicking him out. He earned that. But why do you continue to stay with him? As a student he failed his classes, occasionally throws you money that his father gives to him, doesn't pay mortgage or utilities. Does he even work? This guy isn't relationship material, and I don't see how that isn't clear to you. Get rid of him.", "If you\u2019re looking for permission to drop your dead weight GRANTED NTA", "NTA don't ask him to move out though. Tell him to move out. Check your legal position as he may legally be a tenant and have some rights in terms of a notice period. \n\nHe sounds like a nightmare. Unless he is disabled, he has no reason to not be working. He has a lot of work to do on himself but that's not your problem", "NTA but I didn't even get to the vomit part. The not paying, failing classes, no job etc would have been enough reason. 5 years you have put up with this?", "NTA- he\u2019ll never grow up as long as you\u2019re babying him.", "NTA. KICK HIM OUT!!!", "Reddit is saying you need to break up with him.....", "What the hell has she got to lose?", "NTA\n\nThere is a great quote from the West Wing to describe the type alcoholic he is.\n\n>I don\u2019t have one drink. I don\u2019t understand people who can have one drink. I don\u2019t understand people who leave half a glass of wine on the table. I don\u2019t understand people who say they\u2019ve had enough.\n\nYour boyfriend proved he could *not* drink if he wanted to. What he can\u2019t do is control his drinking once he starts. He tries to go from 0-100 as fast as possible, hence the vomiting before he has even felt the effects of the alcohol.\n\nOn top of that, there seems to nothing reframing about him as a person. Kick him out yesterday.", "I dont usually agree with ending I g.  But you should.  And if he is throwing up and \"not too drunk\" he needs to go to the dr to see if he has an issue.", "OP said he had a job once and like only for three months and hasn't even tried to get another job.", "Agreed. I\u2019m just saying that it\u2019s a realistic possibility it will kill the relationship. \n\nIf she\u2019s cool with that, then so be it."]}
