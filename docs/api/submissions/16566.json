They can do their thing on their birthday.", "NTA. The birthday kid(s) get to pick the activity.  If your wife wants to do teenage boy things for her twins' next birthday, then you can consider the little kids play place now.  But why can't you do 2 birthday things?

Find something you can do with all three kids.", "NTA, respectfully no hate she\u2019s being a complete ass. It\u2019s your son\u2019s birthday NOT the girls. Stand firm with the choice of the movie and arcade.", "NTA and the favoritism comment is rich coming from her asking you to favor your step kids on your sons birthday.

Not everything has to be joined at the hip with the family.", "NTA.  It sounds like you are being considerate and looking out for your sons interest.

Your son will love the day you have planned.", "Nta and remind her whose birthday it is. If she's raising children that have to hijack others special occasions or throw a tantrum then she's failed as a parent.

The birthday boy should get to choose what he wants to do.", "No, no. Your wife is 100% wrong, and extremely manipulative. No 13 year old wants to be made to go to a baby place so his baby sisters can have fun, especially with his 13 year old friends with him. The day is supposed to be about Isaac, not your wife, not her daughters. For her to throw down the \" you're showing them you don't love them\" card is just f*cked up. It's overtly and unnecessarily cruel. I'd take it right back to her and ask why she is making Isaac's birthday about HER daughters, obviously she's showing THEM more love than him on his bday.\n\nYWNBTA", "It is your son's birthday celebration, so HIS wishes should determine how he celebrates.

She can take all three of them to the playground some other day for family time if she wants to.", "NTA.

I\u2019m guessing she knows your past and your self doubts about being a step dad and is using it against you to do what she wants. \n\nIn no way is celebrating your sons birthday the way that he wants, playing favorites.  EVERYONE should get to choose what they want to do for their birthday. I have 4 kids and all of them get to choose what they want to do on their birthday - it\u2019s not playing favorites just celebrating them. \n\nBy her logic, isn\u2019t she playing favorites by wanting to make the girls happy and doing what they want??", "This is sooooo true! Why should a 12/13 year old have to go to a kiddie place for HIS birthday? Maybe __she__ should stop showing favoritism to her daughters over OP\u2019s son. Such ridiculous logic. \n\nNTA. Let Isaac have HIS day that HE picked for HIS birthday.", "Exactlyy plus its his bday and he gets to decide what he wants . The wife is trying to turn it into a family date . Dont let her gaslight you", "> She accused me of favoritism and of not loving my step-daughters as much Isaac.\n\nOP needs to turn this logic around to expose the hypocrisy of his wife: \u201cWhy are you letting the non-birthday children dictate where the birthday child gets to have his party?

After all, I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll enjoy it because there are snacks and kids love snacks, and it\u2019s family time, so she should be happy to force them to do what he wants to do on their birthday.", "Completely agree with this! Also, my kids have always had their own birthday parties with friends and then a smaller family birthday celebration with our immediate family with a favorite meal (at home or restaurant) and a cake.

Please talk with your son on how she treats him behind your back.  Places they go, treats, little things she buys them vs him.  Compare it to how you treat her kids.  I have a feeling that her true colors are starting to show.  Also now is the time to start to put your foot down that he will not babysit her kids ever.  He is getting to the age where she will start to demand this.", "It\u2019s your sons birthday so why would taking a 13 year old boy to a place 7 year old girls love be appropriate?
