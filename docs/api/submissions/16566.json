Make sure Isaac still has a big say as the birthday boy on things like food and maybe some activities,  but it IS okay for a second family celebration to consider younger kids if only because some actives aren't appropriate for their age.

So maybe he can puck another movie he might enjoy thats still safe for his sisters to watch, or you find a playplace the girls like but also does something like laser tag if Isaac likes thst kind of thing.)
