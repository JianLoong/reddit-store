For my own personal ethical reasons. I have no problem with other people eating meat. \n\nI have been watching my nephews on the weekends for the last few months to help my brother out.

I feed them on Saturday and up until an afternoon snack on Sunday. \n\nMy brother gives me some money to watch them but I don't really need it and usually end up spending it on outings for the three of us. Movies, the zoo, museums, that sort of stuff. I like being the fun aunt. I do not limit what the boys eat.  If we are out somewhere and they want a burger or chicken nuggets they get that. \n\nWell their mom found out that the meals at my home were vegan and she had a problem with that. So she packed them snacks with meat. Like jerky and pepperoni sticks and string cheese. I don't want that in my house so I asked her to please not do it again. But she did. So I said that until she understood my very simple rules I would not allow her in the house and I would not watch the kids. \n\nShe thinks I'm being an asshole because her children \"need\" meat. And that I should be grateful for the extra money I get for watching my nephews. Once again I probably spend more on them every weekend than I get from my brother. \n\nMy parents know how I feel about meat. They know I won't even get a dog or a cat as a pet because they need meat in their diets.  My brother has asked me to please go back to the way it was.

If my child wanted bacon at every meal, I wouldn\u2019t ask my kosher in-laws to babysit for them, and then complain they refused to let my kids eat bacon while there. And I CERTAINLY wouldn\u2019t sneak in in their bags, against the wishes of my in-laws. Because I\u2019m not an AH.", "I think the thing is, though, that OP *does* have an issue with it. You say that you don\u2019t have the same issue, and that\u2019s fine - for you. OP has clearly and explicitly stated a boundary for what *she* wants in *her* home. SIL might think it\u2019s a crazy boundary. SIL might think her kids are not getting enough to eat. SIL might even be right! But once a boundary has been set, it\u2019s not okay to just ignore it and continue to do the thing you were asked not to do. I don\u2019t think SIL was wrong to want to send snacks or to send them the first time. I think she was wrong to send them again after being asked not to. Once OP said what her rule was, there were two equally respectful paths SIL could have taken: (1) agreed to follow the rule, or (2) thanked OP for past babysitting services and made different arrangements going forwards.", ">\t Sister in law seems worried that her kids\u2019 daily diet requirements are not being met and so gave them some snacks to eat throughout the day\n\nThen she should bring them to a place where their requirements will be met to her satisfaction. Easy peasy.", "Which part of a kid\u2019s daily diet requirements involves pepperoni and jerky?", ">\u201di personally don\u2019t see SIL packing some snacks for her kids as disrespecting OP\u2019s boundaries?\u201d\n\nShe sent animal products into a vegan household, against OP\u2019s clearly stated boundary. How is that not disrespecting it?", "It's the title more or less", "Saying something wrong and ending it with \"it's just an opinion\" doesn't absolve you from anything.\n\n> you also don\u2019t have to attack people just because they have different beliefs than you\n\nIn my opinion you could. You see how that works?", "So you only have to respect other people\u2019s boundaries *in their own homes* if they are religiously based? \n\nSome people require you to take off your shoes when you enter. You get to leave yours on, because shoes-off is not a religion?", "Rated F for Freaking Funny.\n\nTickets on sale... 6/9.", "I used the word \u201carbitrary\u201d to mirror the comment I was replying to. Her ethics do not change with her location. She does not allow meat into her body or her home. And she still maintains her vegan diet outside the home. AND she respects her niblings\u2019 dietary choices; she doesn\u2019t impose her vegan ethics onto what they put into their own bodies. Only what they bring into her home.\n\nWhich is her prerogative.\n\nEdit: I am totally with you on the \u201ccontrol your woman\u201d part.", "Good, it will let people around them realize they suck", "I see it as being similar to overseas travel. There are countries with very different laws and customs than I\u2019m used to in my country. There are laws in Singapore about chewing gum, for example. I don\u2019t agree with them, but if I freely choose to visit Singapore, then I\u2019m obliged to follow those laws. There are also countries with laws I\u2019m not prepared to just accept, and so I do not visit those countries. This is exactly the choice SIL has here - respectfully comply or respectfully make other plans. She\u2019s under no compulsion to deposit her kids with their aunt every weekend for months.", "I have actual health reasons for my restrictions tho, if I could suck it up and let a kid eat a snack their parents provided them, then so can OP. I agree however that the sister in law should just take her kids elsewhere, this whole thing is ridiculous imo and would be easily resolved by someone else babysitting.", "Unless the kids are taking specific vitamins they are genuinely not getting the same nutrients as they would eating animal products. As someone else pointed out the kids probably complained to their mom about being hungry and wanting meat and cheese since that's what they're used to at home. \n\nAnd it isn't typically required for people to not eat meat and yet there are parents who put their kids on diets like that and would get upset if they were fed meat.", "kicking out /=/ banning someone from your home because you don\u2019t agree with what they choose to eat", "\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "Exactly. They\u2019re entitled to their own views, but ultimately SIL doesn\u2019t get to dictate what OP does, and changing the babysitting arrangements would be an excellent way to de-escalate the situation before it becomes a massive family drama.", "Actually quite a bit of vegan/vegetarian food has more vitamins and nutrients in it than animal products. In fact with just protein alone bean/bean products and nuts have more protein in it than beef. Not to mention calcium is actually easier to obtain with a vegan/vegetarian diet than eating/drinking animal products. For iron, lentils are jam packed with it and give more of it than any meat.", "Its the same as not allowing alcohol", "Do you allow people to smoke in your house?"]}
