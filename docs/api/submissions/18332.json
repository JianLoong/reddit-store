I feed them on Saturday and up until an afternoon snack on Sunday. \n\nMy brother gives me some money to watch them but I don't really need it and usually end up spending it on outings for the three of us.

If we are out somewhere and they want a burger or chicken nuggets they get that. \n\nWell their mom found out that the meals at my home were vegan and she had a problem with that. So she packed them snacks with meat. Like jerky and pepperoni sticks and string cheese. I don't want that in my house so I asked her to please not do it again. But she did. So I said that until she understood my very simple rules I would not allow her in the house and I would not watch the kids. \n\nShe thinks I'm being an asshole because her children \"need\" meat.

I just want to share somethings with you. I found just as surprising as you may find them. \n\nIt has come to my attention that the 'dairy is good and important for kids growing' is a product of predator capitalism of the dairy lobby in the 1920's in America. The food triangle we all saw at some point in school was proposed and pushed by the farmers and milk lobby. Also, if you look at the current food stats, lentils, beans and soy and washed wheat flour (leaving the product called saitan) have a higher amount of protein than quick (processed)/fermented cheese, and other processed dairy products with the sideeffect of much less fat and reducing collesterol (nor relevant for kids but adults). \n\nLooking at the most favored cheeses by younglings (cheese strings, jung gauda and soft milk cheeses, based of the kids in Germany, I honestly haven't seen an American cheese ever, only heard they are a bit different) which mostly fall in the high fat less protein category with a fat in dry mass percentage of 25 to 40%. This is the baseline I am referring to for my previous argument beans and lentils may have more protein.\n\nTaking into account the rising numbers of lactose or milk protein intolerances, it's not the best to recommend anymore. Also, in the last 5 years, the amount of bacteria coming from hurt and overused udders of cows ( I forgot the English word for it) has been pushed to a greater number, as apparently we have advanced in pasteurisation techniques. I say apparently because that's just partially true, we are more energy efficient when pasteurising, but that really should not be the reason to push these numbers in the wrong direction as we do the pasteurisation to have the same result as in 2000, another reason why I stopped most of my milk consumption, but i really despise my morning coffee tasting diffrent with soy/almond/haselnut/rise milk.\n\nI am a chemical engineer with a preferred interest in food and pharmaceutical chemistry", "They eat normal food 5 days a week. 2 days of vegan food can't affect them that much.and if mom is so worried she needs to find other childcare.", "So that's basically free bc your average babysitter will just sit at home with the kids and do nothing.

Saturday afternoon to Sunday afternoon, I think it was?", "When you say paneer and curd, I guess you live somewhere between India/pakistan/turkey/Northern afrika (middle-earth region). \n\nAbout the udder thing, that's really a problem of over industrialised milk production. We are talking about cows that were genetically (by breeding mostly as far as I know) engineered to produce 180 to 300L of milk a day. They need to be milked 2 to 3 times a day, or they live in absolute agony. \n\nIn this context, regionwise, you are right, These milk products in these areas are less industrialised as the cheeses/milk products in europe/south and north america and japan/korea. Paneer and curd being the oldest kinds of cheese with a rather specific way of processing, not really done in America and Europe. In South America, there is definitely a form of curd but no paneer. You can get both in specialised markets for Easter products in Germany, but its not a regular supermarket product here. \n\nI am really sorry but knowing you is not American, I'll freely say it. Most American cheeses are not real cheese. they would not get through a dairy product test in Germany. It may be tasty to some people and most Americans, but real cheese with fully natural ageing is frigging expensive in the USA. The famous yellow cheddar is called a melting cheeseproduct (translated directly from german) and is by its name, not a natural milk product. There are some real cheeses in the USA, but they are difficult to find. \n\nAbout the beliefs. That's a kinda sore topic in the Western political context. There is people calling it a 'cult' to be vegan, there is people comparing it to a religion, there is people completely not caring and there is a whole bunch of kids in europe wanting to be vegetarian and/or vegan for the enviroment.\nI am not a med, I can not say anything useful about kids, veganism, and malnutrition. \nAll coming now is personal belives and not really founded or based. \nBut I think I read about some newer studies stating a vegan diet is definitely not more malnutritioning as a fast food diet, some parents let their kids have. It's also not as malnutritioning in regard to the number of kids having food issues (in europe) and being over all very picky eaters/ bulimic or having body issues with a food component thanks to social media. \nAt least in Germany, Italy, France and Spain (regions I visited most and read most about) veganism seems to not be warned about by pediatricians as problematic for younger folks. It may also be a reason, vegan food is rather easy to get informed about, if you buy a cookbook they mostly come with nutrition stats and the people deciding to go vegan for their own good usually check into the nutrition thing on their own. Different vegan options and substitutes are widely available and not always pricyer than the 'normal product'. A true vegan going person will not only use subs, substitutes are more for the transitioners who dont know champingions  have the same umami as ground beef if you know how to spice food. The belive veganism robs you of nutrients make just no sense as diet culture refers to vitamins and microelements as nutrients coming from lentils beans an other legumes and now veganism is malnutritioning,  make that make sense. And as we learned in the last 10 years the source of your protein is rather nonimportant and more up to personal preference ( supplements in bodybuilding previously coming from animals are now synthetically produced, are they now vegan or not).\n\n From a (bio)chemical stand point if the molecule looks the same or integrates in the human energy cycle the same (even though being a little diffrent), not making any weird or harmful products after synthesis, does it really make much difference? But this is more a ethical qualm for every own person to decide.", "OP\u2019s line in the sand is non-began food inside her house.
