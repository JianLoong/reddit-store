I (29m) am living with the mother (Jane 27f) of my almost 2-year-old child. Things are never going to work out for us romantically. However, she continues to live with me until she is able to afford to live on her own and until I can afford childcare. She works on the weekends and is a SAHM. I make sure to pull my parenting weight and appreciate all she does for our son. I work full-time. We get along fine but recently I have gotten very frustrated with her.\n\nI cook most of our dinners and pay for about 75% of the groceries. One of the responsibilities she has insisted on keeping was grocery shopping because it gets her out of the house. But then she wouldn't make herself a list, get overwhelmed, and either buy way too much or way too little so I started making her lists about a month ago. There are a couple of issues.\n\nIf I make her a list of 30 items she'll get maybe 10 items on it and then 20 other random things. I recently started counting how many items she misses and she gets mad at me for this and accuses me of \"keeping score\" which our old therapist said not to do. She says she gets confused, can't find what I put on the list, or just decides to do her own thing, which is the second issue.\n\nI don't have celiac disease, we're still trying to figure out what's wrong, but when I eat wheat/gluten I end up with pretty bad stomach aches, migraines, and hives, all of which are miserable to go to work with. She doesn't take the time to get the items I put on the list and will make substitutions. Then when she cooks a meal I find out later that she used something with wheat/gluten and I wind up sick for two days. This has happened multiple times.\n\nMy solution was to begin doing the grocery shopping myself after work twice a week which causes me to get home an hour or so later than normal. She's now calling me an AH because this is cutting into her self-care time in the evenings which is true, but my argument is that this could all be avoided if she'd just follow the damn lists or not be clueless and flippant when buying ingredients/making meals.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1690566185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15c421l/aita_for_getting_groceries_myself_and_cutting/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Can you order your groceries online and schedule to pick them up on your way home?  This would allow you to state no substitutions,  get most things on the list, barring out of stock items and still give her  \"me tine\". Then if she wants to go to the store for herself she won't have to worry about fulfilling your list as she's incapable of sticking to your dietary needs. \n\nWe started doing this during Covid and found it really helps us to stick to our budget and get the items we need without impulse buying.  It also saves us time spent wandering the store.  I order them late at night and pick them up on my way home the next day.  I still get the sales prices, in store deals and can use physical coupons at pick up.   We'll go into the store maybe once a month for ' in store only deals' and to see what's new or just to get perishables restocked but those trips are much quicker now with the bulk of our shipping done online.", "So you're just doing a chore instead of her, I understand that correctly?

You could end up in hospital.", "Your health is self care too.", "So i also struggle with instore shopping to lists and also like to use the time as get out of the house time. So what i do is set a pickup order time and order my necessary stuff for meals and such then i leave about 30 minutes before my hour pickup window to browse the store for whatever i want and my impulse shopping/get out of the house time. We end up with everything we need+ some odd fun snacks or things i find for us.", "Yeah. We tried the curbside pickup thing and I would do the ordering. The first time the store gave me unsafe (for me) substitutions without me knowing and the second time she \"forgot\" to pick it up so I had to go get it after work anyway.", "I'm guessing because someone has to take care of the kid. It sounds like she would ordinarily go out/do something on her own while OP cared for the kid, but now he's out grocery shopping, so she can't.", "She does but her complaint is that it doesn't feel \"adult enough\" which is why she wants another reason to get out of the house. I kind of get it. Kind of don't.", "I've considered it but worried she'd throw a fit. Plus it still would present the issue of me having to shop separately.", "Yes, results have been conflicting, and has only been an issue for the last year or so.", "Tried twice. The first time the store messed up and substituted my GF items for non-GF. The second time she forgot to pick it up.", "She usually goes while I'm at work.", "From dinner time on I take care of feeding him, bathing him, playing with him and putting him to bed. She gets the evenings and most of her non-working weekend hours to herself (I usually take him to see my parents and hers on Saturday and Sunday).", "We are not married. We tried to make things work after our little guy was born but we are just incompatible. We are coparenting and she lives with me until we can both be more financially stable for our kid.", "Spending an hour at the grocery store is pretty common if you're not the type of person who decide, \"this and exactly this is what I'm going to eat for the next several days\". It typically takes me like 30-45 minutes to visit a store, usually due to seeing things on sale and debating whether I actually want to grab that other thing that I haven't had in a while but looks good.", "I'll admit that's on me not meal planning correctly. Working on that. We also get groceries for my parents because they have difficulty navigating stores so for her, bigger grocery orders are hard to manage.", "2 times a week is normal for people who use a lot of produce.", "NTA.  If you want to, then you could try online grocery shopping, or click and collect where you order online and she picks up to get her put of the house? \n\nHowever you are not obliged to do this.", "I don't know about your store, but every store I've ever ordered groceries through offers at least \"Do not substitute\" per each item and often lets you pick your subsitute. Have you looked into that?", "OK, so pickup's out (although if you complained to the manager after the first time they'd flag your account and it generally wouldn't happen again).\n\nAlso: she's never going to be able to afford living on her own.  She'll \"forget\" to go to an interview, or \"forget\" something key at work and get fired.  Like I said, weaponized incompetence.", "It is fair, being inside all day sucks. I don't think I'd channel that into grocery shopping though.\nBest luck.", "Another option is that she shops when you come home from work and watch your kid. And CALL you when she can\u2019t find the right item. \n\nGrocery shopping w a 2 year old in tow is a lot of work & distraction. That\u2019s not an excuse to consistently make you sick. But the distraction doesn\u2019t help.\n\nIf she complains that shopping at night takes away her relaxing time, MANY moms consider shopping w/out a toddler like a vacation.\ud83e\udd2d (I\u2019m a mom of 2 kids 1.5 years apart & did all the shopping w them in tow as toddlers.

Use it for toilet roll and cans of tomatoes, etc. \n\nThen the second trip each week is only for the items you want to be more sure about. Keep this list as short as possible. \n\nOnce you\u2019ve got the split sorted, she could *maybe* earn back the right to do the shop - but on a \u201cno mistakes or you lose the privilege\u201d basis. \n\nAnd I\u2019m mostly in agreement that she doesn\u2019t want to do better, and will never get a job if she cannot follow a simple shopping list - so if you can kick her out then do it.", "Nevermind I saw you already tried this and she forgot.\n\nHas she been screened for ADHD?", "I could look at the website again. I'm stubborn when it comes to stuff like that, lol but that's a me issue. I can be very one-strike-your-out.", "Yeah, I do pickup at four different branded stores around here, and they range from \"we'll call you/send an alert on the app to let you pick substitutions\" to \"we only give you exactly what you ask for so your order might only be half as big as you're anticipating.\"\n\nIf someone's just randomly substituting, that's an employee freelancing (or a genuine picking error) and like I said, a call to the store fixes that situation for next time.", "I agree.  I suggested ADHD but PPD could be it too.", "Yeah, I don't like mistakes either, especially ones where I end up with things I can't use.\n\nBut look at it this way. There is no way even the best run operation can't ever make mistakes. Mistakes will happen. By the law of averages, sometimes the mistakes will happen to you. One strike and you're out means eventually everyone will be out. The best way to judge is how do they fix their mistake? Do they refund the money?", "I think you made the mistake of not confirming that you want no substitutions (which is part of the checkout process for pretty much every online grocery purchase).   Often you can actually choose the substituted product as well.\n\nSo you have one strike against yourself and you're out?"]}
