However,  it's important to read the room and only do it out loud around people who are cool with it.\n\nIt drives my dad *crazy*, but he actively shows me movies that have a twist (after he has watched them) to see if I can figure it out. So far, there is one movie I didn't see it coming, and feel like a moron for.", "My best friend does this, and he\u2019s shockingly good at it.  However, it is pretty annoying to me cause I like to passively experience and understand the movie, and get enjoyment from when there are big turns or dramatic reveals.  That\u2019s the fun aspect for me the first time I watch a movie.  I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s exactly how your girlfriend likes to experience movies, but it may be like this based on her reaction.  \n\nMy friend, as you can guess, and likely same as you, likes to think about the plot as it\u2019s been presented and guess where it\u2019s going to go.  That\u2019s how he enjoys the movie.  That\u2019s a fine way to enjoy a movie.  \n\nIf it was just two people experiencing it this way independently, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all.  Where I tend to get aggravated, and I agree with your SO, is the sharing your theory part.  It ruins the reveals and turns by taking away their shock factor, cause the idea was in her head already.  Though it\u2019s cool you got it right, it takes away from the movie she\u2019s wanting to watch.  I\u2019ll assume this is the first occurrence of this, but if this has been a pattern, the annoying factor increases very quickly.  \n\nYTA.  Did you mean to be?

You just wanted an ego boost.", "NTA", "Back when I was younger and going all the time with friends, I was always able to call twists, and it was kinda part of the fun. \"Ha!

I hate when people treat movies like it's something to outsmart; like they are winning if they can guess the plot twists and endings.

Omg y'all cannot watch Black Mirror haha there'd be a ton of theory crafting type of stuff, so definitely try to keep your mouth shut if ya do haha", "NAH. This is a normal type of comment when watching a movie.", "NTA.   Honestly, it\u2019s something I do a lot as well.  Movies or Tv.  But then I was a fiction writing minor in college.  I can\u2019t help but watch many things from a writers perspective.", "It doesn't count as a spoiler to guess a plot twist, but you were a *potential* asshole it two ways: first, not everybody likes sharing speculation, and second, talking in a movie theater can be an asshole move if it is too loud.\n\nYou said you whispered, so I am inclined to give you a pass on that second one.  And for the first one, that is a difference in how people enjoy art and stories, and I think both \"engaging with the experience and trying to enter into intellectual conversation with the author by trying to predict plot twists\" and \"allowing the experience to unfold according to the artist's design, encountering each twist and reveal at the point where the artist put it\" are both 100% valid ways to enjoy art.\n\nSo I think I will go with NAH, and now you know better - she enjoys having the experience unfold for her the way the various artists imagined it unfolding; you enjoy challenging yourself against the art.  So long as you both remember this about each other, and don't harsh each other's squee, I think you are good.\n\nBee tee dubs:  couple fun Prowler facts: in the main Marvel Universe, the Prowler is Hobie Brown - Spider-Punk in this movie.  He started out as a criminal - actually, he started out as a window washer who was also a tech genius and created gizmos to help him wash windows, but when he lost his job and his family was hungry, he used his window-washing gizmos to commit burglary, trying to hit corporations instead of people.  When he was burglarizing the Daily Bugle, he encountered Peter Parker and accidentally knocked him out a window trying to run away, thought he killed him, and was wracked with guilt.  Spiderman found him, told him that Parker was just fine, but maybe knock off the criming before someone actually got hurt, and the Prowler became an ally of Spiderman's, even eventually helping Spiderman protect his secret identity by dressing up as Spidey and using his wall-crawling abilities to pretend to be Spidey so Parker and Spiderman could be seen in the same place at the same time.\n\nDonald Glover was there as an alternate Earth Prowler, because he played Aaron Davis in Spiderman-Homecoming, where he was a small-time criminal who helped Spiderman take down Vulture because \"my nephew Miles lives in this neighborhood.\"\n\nDonald Glover is important in the creation of Miles Morales, because his character in COMMUNITY was a Spiderman fan, and there was a legitimate push to consider him for the role that eventually went to Andrew Garfield, but because of that, Bendis decided that the Spiderman in the Ultimates line would be black, and created Miles in response to Glover.  And Glover voiced Morales in the first animated version on Disney.", "NAH", "YTA. Keep opinions to yourself unless the spouse directly asks.

I talk if other people are ok with it.", "Boy have I got news for you - \"out loud\" means \"loud enough to be heard\" and does, in fact, include audible whispering. Given OP's gf heard OP, he definitely said it out loud.", "AITA is a fun read at times, but a significant portion of the judgments here are completely disconnected from reality. I once read a topic where the mob judged a woman negatively for choosing to watch her grandchild instead of her other child's dogs. Absolutely insane.", "You didn't need to include the spoiler AT ALL. Why warn people when you can just leave it out?", "What do you think talking is?", "bruh OP said they were WHISPERING can y\u2019all not read !! \u2620\ufe0f", "They normally talk at the movies though and OP specified no one was in the cinema when they watched it so I see no harm. NTA", "You get one get-out-of-jail-free card with this one. After that, YTA.", ">since movies are often lazy and lack originality\n\nr/iamverysmart", "I thought Rio was gonna be the prowler but it being Miles was also awesome", "Not in a movie theater, surely! You are annoying everyone around you! If you want to talk to each other, be decent people and wait until the movie is on Netflix.", "No, one of these is objectively correct when you're in a movie theater with other people who have paid to see the movie and not to hear your inane commentary, and that is that you should shut your piehole. There is NO excuse for talking during a movie in a theater, period. Don't be that jerk.", "I seem to be Perfect Razzmatazz\u2019s mother too. \n\n\nAlthough I\u2019ve stopped announcing my guesses aloud in the past couple of years after a \u201cstealth\u201d twist caught me by surprise. It was a franchise action movie and previous entries had been pretty straightforward. When the \u201ctwist\u201d was revealed I got so excited because 1) wasn\u2019t expecting it and 2) for some reason never even speculated the science in the franchise going that way (even tho it makes sense). \n\n\nIt gave my neurodivergent brain an example of how others feel when something like this surprises them in a movie, so I\u2019ve been doing my best to keep quiet and let them have fun.", "Whispering schmispering. We can still hear you.\n\nApologies if I am not interpreting your skull emoji correctly. I am GenX and I don't speak emoji.", "My wife LOVES to try and stump me when it comes to movies, books and tv. It\u2019s become a running thing. It\u2019s all about perspective. Maybe they just aren\u2019t compatible. \n\nNTA if you had seen it already then that\u2019s entirely different.", "As long as no ones sitting around me.  I'm not talking about full on conversations, but a lean in and whisper 2 words isnt bothersome, others won't even hear it over the sound of the movie.", "Are you OP\u2019s gf? LOL", "I hear it. Far too much. More people can hear it than you think.\n\nAlso, if I went to a movie with someone and they whispered at me, I'd be hella annoyed.\n\nJust keep your trap shut until after-movie drinks. Is that so hard?\n\nJust out of curiosity, do you apply the same standard to live performances? Because the actors can hear/see you, as well as the people around you. I know this from experience."]}
