So far, there is one movie I didn't see it coming, and feel like a moron for.", "My best friend does this, and he\u2019s shockingly good at it.  However, it is pretty annoying to me cause I like to passively experience and understand the movie, and get enjoyment from when there are big turns or dramatic reveals.  That\u2019s the fun aspect for me the first time I watch a movie.  I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s exactly how your girlfriend likes to experience movies, but it may be like this based on her reaction.  \n\nMy friend, as you can guess, and likely same as you, likes to think about the plot as it\u2019s been presented and guess where it\u2019s going to go.  That\u2019s how he enjoys the movie.  That\u2019s a fine way to enjoy a movie.  \n\nIf it was just two people experiencing it this way independently, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all.  Where I tend to get aggravated, and I agree with your SO, is the sharing your theory part.  It ruins the reveals and turns by taking away their shock factor, cause the idea was in her head already.  Though it\u2019s cool you got it right, it takes away from the movie she\u2019s wanting to watch.  I\u2019ll assume this is the first occurrence of this, but if this has been a pattern, the annoying factor increases very quickly.  \n\nYTA.  Did you mean to be?

Omg y'all cannot watch Black Mirror haha there'd be a ton of theory crafting type of stuff, so definitely try to keep your mouth shut if ya do haha", "NAH.

I can\u2019t help but watch many things from a writers perspective.", "It doesn't count as a spoiler to guess a plot twist, but you were a *potential* asshole it two ways: first, not everybody likes sharing speculation, and second, talking in a movie theater can be an asshole move if it is too loud.\n\nYou said you whispered, so I am inclined to give you a pass on that second one.  And for the first one, that is a difference in how people enjoy art and stories, and I think both \"engaging with the experience and trying to enter into intellectual conversation with the author by trying to predict plot twists\" and \"allowing the experience to unfold according to the artist's design, encountering each twist and reveal at the point where the artist put it\" are both 100% valid ways to enjoy art.\n\nSo I think I will go with NAH, and now you know better - she enjoys having the experience unfold for her the way the various artists imagined it unfolding; you enjoy challenging yourself against the art.  So long as you both remember this about each other, and don't harsh each other's squee, I think you are good.\n\nBee tee dubs:  couple fun Prowler facts: in the main Marvel Universe, the Prowler is Hobie Brown - Spider-Punk in this movie.  He started out as a criminal - actually, he started out as a window washer who was also a tech genius and created gizmos to help him wash windows, but when he lost his job and his family was hungry, he used his window-washing gizmos to commit burglary, trying to hit corporations instead of people.  When he was burglarizing the Daily Bugle, he encountered Peter Parker and accidentally knocked him out a window trying to run away, thought he killed him, and was wracked with guilt.  Spiderman found him, told him that Parker was just fine, but maybe knock off the criming before someone actually got hurt, and the Prowler became an ally of Spiderman's, even eventually helping Spiderman protect his secret identity by dressing up as Spidey and using his wall-crawling abilities to pretend to be Spidey so Parker and Spiderman could be seen in the same place at the same time.\n\nDonald Glover was there as an alternate Earth Prowler, because he played Aaron Davis in Spiderman-Homecoming, where he was a small-time criminal who helped Spiderman take down Vulture because \"my nephew Miles lives in this neighborhood.\"\n\nDonald Glover is important in the creation of Miles Morales, because his character in COMMUNITY was a Spiderman fan, and there was a legitimate push to consider him for the role that eventually went to Andrew Garfield, but because of that, Bendis decided that the Spiderman in the Ultimates line would be black, and created Miles in response to Glover.  And Glover voiced Morales in the first animated version on Disney.", "NAH", "YTA. Keep opinions to yourself unless the spouse directly asks.
