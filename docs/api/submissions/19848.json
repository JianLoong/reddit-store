You made a theory and shared it, it turned out to be true. Honest mistake and wouldn\u2019t say your the AH. Your girlfriend has every right to be upset - spoilers suck. She should be able to realise though that you were guessing and didn\u2019t mean to spoil. \n\nIn future I\u2019d say just avoid talking till after a film has finished", "If the person you're watching with doesn't want your predictions, then keep your mouth shut or just say you know and don't specify.\n\nMe personally, I love when my partner guesses the twist correctly. I find it cool. But I also don't care about spoilers.\nEdit: NAH", "Info: is it generally okay for either of you to speak/whisper to each other while watching movies?", "I do this pretty accurately, too. However,  it's important to read the room and only do it out loud around people who are cool with it.\n\nIt drives my dad *crazy*, but he actively shows me movies that have a twist (after he has watched them) to see if I can figure it out. So far, there is one movie I didn't see it coming, and feel like a moron for.", "My best friend does this, and he\u2019s shockingly good at it.  However, it is pretty annoying to me cause I like to passively experience and understand the movie, and get enjoyment from when there are big turns or dramatic reveals.  That\u2019s the fun aspect for me the first time I watch a movie.  I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s exactly how your girlfriend likes to experience movies, but it may be like this based on her reaction.  \n\nMy friend, as you can guess, and likely same as you, likes to think about the plot as it\u2019s been presented and guess where it\u2019s going to go.  That\u2019s how he enjoys the movie.  That\u2019s a fine way to enjoy a movie.  \n\nIf it was just two people experiencing it this way independently, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all.  Where I tend to get aggravated, and I agree with your SO, is the sharing your theory part.  It ruins the reveals and turns by taking away their shock factor, cause the idea was in her head already.  Though it\u2019s cool you got it right, it takes away from the movie she\u2019s wanting to watch.  I\u2019ll assume this is the first occurrence of this, but if this has been a pattern, the annoying factor increases very quickly.  \n\nYTA.  Did you mean to be?  My guess is no, but in this case you needed an audience for your guess, cause it\u2019s not cool if only you know you guessed the plot.", "NTA. Those movies are getting too predictable and it makes sense that you'd be able to call it out.  If anything the writers are the assholes for causing this problem in your relationship.", "YTA - Don\u2019t talk during movies", "NTA - unless she has asked/implied before to not share your predictions. If she has, than YTA.", "NTA some movies plots and storyline are predictable", "YTA. Keep quiet during the film.", "YTA for talking at the theatre", "YTA. There\u2019s no reason to talk during the movie. If you talk during a movie, especially in a movie theater, you are an asshole. Period. There was literally no reason for you to say this out loud during the movie.", "Soft YTA I literally had the same thought and was about to do the same thing as you but restrained myself. It's more fun to have that dawn of understanding then to have someone tell you what's happening.", "YTA.  Watching a movie with a talker/critic/predictor is insufferable.", "YTA. Unless the person you're with wants to discuss the movie's twists in real time, don't.  \\[Note to self: Don't watch any mystery movies with OP.\\]", "YTA\n\nTo me, the point is that you spoke during the movie, describing what would happen later. This is a huge no-no. Doesn't matter if you were right or not.\n\nif you're going to make a prediction, you have to be aware of the fact you could be right. So if you are right, it's no different then someone who knows the outcome and spoils it anyway.", "YTA\n\nThese hollywood blockbuster type movies can seem insanely predictable. But not to everyone! Let others enjoy it, stay quiet.", "YTA\n\nThere's nothing to gain by doing this other than being able to go \"I knew it', while simultaneously spoiling it for her or anybody else.  It's not an uncommon trope for comic/sci-fi films.\n\nYou can wait until the end and say, \"I saw that coming because of x, y, z\".", "YTA - both in the movie as well as here for spoiling it.  How hard is it to just be quiet? Is this some kind of alpha power thing?", "YTA. If the person you're with appreciates the sharing, it's fine. If the person you're with doesn't, and has expressed so, then you're TA for ignoring that and doing it. When you don't know which type the person is yet, it's rude to assume they are, because the behavior you're engaging in can be just generally annoying, making the experience all about you rather than letting the storytelling unfold. The way the story is told is a big part of taking in a movie. Ruining that in the hopes of getting applause for guessing correctly is an AH move.", "YTA.\n\nA) Let the surprise moments come without ruining it for others. What's the point other than proving that you knew before it happened? I saw the computer monitor say Earth 42, I didn't immediately turn to them and go wait he went to the wrong universe, because I recognized that wasn't intended to be obvious. \n\nB) Guessing that 5 seconds before it's revealed isn't remarkable at all. I have friends who have bragged about guessing a plot point just before it's shown on screen and it seems so sad that they want the validation of being soooo smaaaart.\n\nC) You wrote Into, not Across for the movie title.\n\nD) If the people I saw the movie with talked during that scene, I would've smacked them.", "NAH.  Everyone has their preference on hat sort of things. You now know your girlfriend's preference on this.  So you now know to keep it to yourself when watching a movie with her.\n\nNow if you keep doing it, then you'll be an asshole.", "NAH.  If you do it again, then YWBTA.", "YTA\nWell done on you for predicting the twist but it kinda ruins it for others who just want to experience the film as it\u2019s played.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Viewers might want to try to pick up on these observations and piece together what it might mean, sort of like a light version of a murder mystery. \n\nOP probably wants the GF to continue to enjoy spending time together watching stuff like that.

That\u2019s why I say NAH. Wasn\u2019t trying to criticise the GF, apologies if it looked that way.
