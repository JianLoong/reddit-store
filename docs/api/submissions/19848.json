So far, there is one movie I didn't see it coming, and feel like a moron for.", "My best friend does this, and he\u2019s shockingly good at it.  However, it is pretty annoying to me cause I like to passively experience and understand the movie, and get enjoyment from when there are big turns or dramatic reveals.  That\u2019s the fun aspect for me the first time I watch a movie.  I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s exactly how your girlfriend likes to experience movies, but it may be like this based on her reaction.  \n\nMy friend, as you can guess, and likely same as you, likes to think about the plot as it\u2019s been presented and guess where it\u2019s going to go.  That\u2019s how he enjoys the movie.  That\u2019s a fine way to enjoy a movie.  \n\nIf it was just two people experiencing it this way independently, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all.  Where I tend to get aggravated, and I agree with your SO, is the sharing your theory part.  It ruins the reveals and turns by taking away their shock factor, cause the idea was in her head already.  Though it\u2019s cool you got it right, it takes away from the movie she\u2019s wanting to watch.  I\u2019ll assume this is the first occurrence of this, but if this has been a pattern, the annoying factor increases very quickly.  \n\nYTA.  Did you mean to be?

Omg y'all cannot watch Black Mirror haha there'd be a ton of theory crafting type of stuff, so definitely try to keep your mouth shut if ya do haha", "NAH.

I can\u2019t help but watch many things from a writers perspective.", "It doesn't count as a spoiler to guess a plot twist, but you were a *potential* asshole it two ways: first, not everybody likes sharing speculation, and second, talking in a movie theater can be an asshole move if it is too loud.\n\nYou said you whispered, so I am inclined to give you a pass on that second one.  And for the first one, that is a difference in how people enjoy art and stories, and I think both \"engaging with the experience and trying to enter into intellectual conversation with the author by trying to predict plot twists\" and \"allowing the experience to unfold according to the artist's design, encountering each twist and reveal at the point where the artist put it\" are both 100% valid ways to enjoy art.\n\nSo I think I will go with NAH, and now you know better - she enjoys having the experience unfold for her the way the various artists imagined it unfolding; you enjoy challenging yourself against the art.  So long as you both remember this about each other, and don't harsh each other's squee, I think you are good.\n\nBee tee dubs:  couple fun Prowler facts: in the main Marvel Universe, the Prowler is Hobie Brown - Spider-Punk in this movie.  He started out as a criminal - actually, he started out as a window washer who was also a tech genius and created gizmos to help him wash windows, but when he lost his job and his family was hungry, he used his window-washing gizmos to commit burglary, trying to hit corporations instead of people.  When he was burglarizing the Daily Bugle, he encountered Peter Parker and accidentally knocked him out a window trying to run away, thought he killed him, and was wracked with guilt.  Spiderman found him, told him that Parker was just fine, but maybe knock off the criming before someone actually got hurt, and the Prowler became an ally of Spiderman's, even eventually helping Spiderman protect his secret identity by dressing up as Spidey and using his wall-crawling abilities to pretend to be Spidey so Parker and Spiderman could be seen in the same place at the same time.\n\nDonald Glover was there as an alternate Earth Prowler, because he played Aaron Davis in Spiderman-Homecoming, where he was a small-time criminal who helped Spiderman take down Vulture because \"my nephew Miles lives in this neighborhood.\"\n\nDonald Glover is important in the creation of Miles Morales, because his character in COMMUNITY was a Spiderman fan, and there was a legitimate push to consider him for the role that eventually went to Andrew Garfield, but because of that, Bendis decided that the Spiderman in the Ultimates line would be black, and created Miles in response to Glover.  And Glover voiced Morales in the first animated version on Disney.", "NAH", "YTA. Keep opinions to yourself unless the spouse directly asks.

This was at least a full 5 minutes before the scene in the movie, showed that he was indeed dead.

At that point, after the \ud83e\udd2c I, being an AH yelled, \"I told you so\" \ud83e\udd23 and high tailed it out of there.

It really depends on if your gf got mad because you talked or because you predicted it. If your gf and you talk often during movies and even share predictions then this isn't really something out of the blue and you're probably not the asshole.\n\nDon't know why there's such a vocal group of people who detest people talking to their friends at the movies so much. I feel like it somewhat defeats the point if you just sit there in silence. Maybe it's just a difference in friend groups but my friends and I whisper to each other all the time (keeping in mind to be quiet as to not be invasive to others in the theater). More importantly, I think it's hasty for people to jump to the conclusion that OP's gf is a \"no talking during the movie\" person and are projecting their own wishes rather than keeping in mind the context.\n\nImo, NTA because she was only mad BECAUSE you were right, not because you talked during a movie or because you threw out a prediction in the first place.", "NAH, I do the same, if I\u2019m in company with people who don\u2019t like me doing it, I write it down on a piece of paper and put it out of my reach, because I\u2019m petty and pathetic and still want the credit if I\u2019m right.", "Omg poor you I laughed so hard at the title (ngl).

Like you, I leaned over and told my husband what I thought was happening. He joked later that I'd ruined it for him, but in reality, he was more impressed than upset. We do this all the time with movies & tv shows. Our kids too. We all throw out our theories and watch to see who's right (if anyone). It's a game for us. The only time anybody gets upset is if someone has seen it before and is giving out actual spoilers. Correct predictions are fine, leaking known information is not. \n\nYour wife, on the other hand, apparently feels differently about this. In the future, ask her if she wants to know what your predictions are or if she has any of her own. If she'd rather just watch and allow the show to unfold at it's own pace, keep quiet.\n\nETA: We only do this when watching things at home.

I'm voting NAH because it sounds like you didn't know how she felt about this issue and meant no harm; but it's also understandable she feels differently and is upset.

I figured something out and so badly wanted to tell my bestie but I knew he didn't realize it. I kept looking over and debating but ultimately kept it to myself and it delivered a bigger payoff.\n\nI think her feelings are justified as it was a major twist and it got ruined for her which may have also soured her feelings towards the movie as a whole, y'know? So, maybe a soft YTA because you mentioned y'all talk in movies all the time (I do it with my friends too), but you have to understand that most people do not want to hear your theories and want to either figure it out on their own or watch it without knowing what's coming.\n\nAdditionally/edit, when I talk to my bestie we usually make fun of scenes or just go oh my god together. We never SAY SPOILERS in a movie theater surrounded by other people.", "My boyfriend said the EXACT SAME THING!!

Aaron mentions he took his braids out, which would imply he's different in this universe, the only members of his family we didn't see were him and his father, who died, so it clearly couldn't be him, Mile's hoodie in this universe was purple instead of red, and if this is the world where the spider came from but Miles had never been bit, then he'd clearly be doing something different. Saying \"Oh, I'm not the Prowler\" gave everything away, but it was still great to see play out because of how unbelievable it seemed.
