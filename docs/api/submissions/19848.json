She should be able to realise though that you were guessing and didn\u2019t mean to spoil. \n\nIn future I\u2019d say just avoid talking till after a film has finished", "If the person you're watching with doesn't want your predictions, then keep your mouth shut or just say you know and don't specify.\n\nMe personally, I love when my partner guesses the twist correctly. I find it cool. But I also don't care about spoilers.\nEdit: NAH", "Info: is it generally okay for either of you to speak/whisper to each other while watching movies?", "I do this pretty accurately, too. However,  it's important to read the room and only do it out loud around people who are cool with it.\n\nIt drives my dad *crazy*, but he actively shows me movies that have a twist (after he has watched them) to see if I can figure it out. So far, there is one movie I didn't see it coming, and feel like a moron for.", "My best friend does this, and he\u2019s shockingly good at it.  However, it is pretty annoying to me cause I like to passively experience and understand the movie, and get enjoyment from when there are big turns or dramatic reveals.  That\u2019s the fun aspect for me the first time I watch a movie.  I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s exactly how your girlfriend likes to experience movies, but it may be like this based on her reaction.  \n\nMy friend, as you can guess, and likely same as you, likes to think about the plot as it\u2019s been presented and guess where it\u2019s going to go.  That\u2019s how he enjoys the movie.  That\u2019s a fine way to enjoy a movie.  \n\nIf it was just two people experiencing it this way independently, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that at all.  Where I tend to get aggravated, and I agree with your SO, is the sharing your theory part.  It ruins the reveals and turns by taking away their shock factor, cause the idea was in her head already.  Though it\u2019s cool you got it right, it takes away from the movie she\u2019s wanting to watch.  I\u2019ll assume this is the first occurrence of this, but if this has been a pattern, the annoying factor increases very quickly.  \n\nYTA.  Did you mean to be?  My guess is no, but in this case you needed an audience for your guess, cause it\u2019s not cool if only you know you guessed the plot.", "NTA. Those movies are getting too predictable and it makes sense that you'd be able to call it out.

There was literally no reason for you to say this out loud during the movie.", "Soft YTA I literally had the same thought and was about to do the same thing as you but restrained myself. It's more fun to have that dawn of understanding then to have someone tell you what's happening.", "YTA.  Watching a movie with a talker/critic/predictor is insufferable.", "YTA. Unless the person you're with wants to discuss the movie's twists in real time, don't.  \\[Note to self: Don't watch any mystery movies with OP.\\]", "YTA\n\nTo me, the point is that you spoke during the movie, describing what would happen later. This is a huge no-no. Doesn't matter if you were right or not.\n\nif you're going to make a prediction, you have to be aware of the fact you could be right. So if you are right, it's no different then someone who knows the outcome and spoils it anyway.", "YTA\n\nThese hollywood blockbuster type movies can seem insanely predictable. But not to everyone! Let others enjoy it, stay quiet.", "YTA\n\nThere's nothing to gain by doing this other than being able to go \"I knew it', while simultaneously spoiling it for her or anybody else.  It's not an uncommon trope for comic/sci-fi films.\n\nYou can wait until the end and say, \"I saw that coming because of x, y, z\".", "YTA - both in the movie as well as here for spoiling it.  How hard is it to just be quiet? Is this some kind of alpha power thing?", "YTA. If the person you're with appreciates the sharing, it's fine. If the person you're with doesn't, and has expressed so, then you're TA for ignoring that and doing it. When you don't know which type the person is yet, it's rude to assume they are, because the behavior you're engaging in can be just generally annoying, making the experience all about you rather than letting the storytelling unfold. The way the story is told is a big part of taking in a movie. Ruining that in the hopes of getting applause for guessing correctly is an AH move.", "YTA.\n\nA) Let the surprise moments come without ruining it for others. What's the point other than proving that you knew before it happened? I saw the computer monitor say Earth 42, I didn't immediately turn to them and go wait he went to the wrong universe, because I recognized that wasn't intended to be obvious. \n\nB) Guessing that 5 seconds before it's revealed isn't remarkable at all. I have friends who have bragged about guessing a plot point just before it's shown on screen and it seems so sad that they want the validation of being soooo smaaaart.\n\nC) You wrote Into, not Across for the movie title.\n\nD) If the people I saw the movie with talked during that scene, I would've smacked them.", "NAH.  Everyone has their preference on hat sort of things. You now know your girlfriend's preference on this.

That\u2019s why I say NAH. Wasn\u2019t trying to criticise the GF, apologies if it looked that way.

Every once in a while, I\u2019ll give him a free shot to call a plot twist because I know he loves it. Compromise is key, my friend.", "YTA don't spoil it for people. Let them figure it out on their own.

If they persist, I'll ask if they really want me to spoil it for them. If they do, then so be it, but it's not my fault. \n\nI'm lucky these days. Wife does want to know, and relishes my acumen. There have been famous movies I haven't seen yet that she wanted me to see (and I've assiduously avoided internet content on) just because she wanted to see if I'd figure it out. \n\nNo I'm not a super genius, I just have a fairly useless knack.", "YTA, you just had to give your 2 cents huh.

Does she want you to keep it to yourself? The correct answer is what the two of you decide so long as you don't ruin other people's viewing. So why are you asking us.", "YTA. Keep your plot ideas to yourself until the movie is over.", "Gotta love all the people decrying OP for whispering to his GF. You guys must be a lot of fun.", "NTA. My husband did the exact same thing when we saw it in theaters last week, but it didn't bother me. He's very good at guessing plot twists and the ending of movies, shows, ect.

If you constantly do this, then QUIT IT.\n\nOne of my superpowers is guessing plots and twists to movies and shows. It happened so often, my husband and I came to an agreement that I would keep my lips zipped unless he asked for my predictions.

Sometimes he\u2019ll test my superpowers by asking a specific question about a plot point with smaller stakes.

I would be upset too.", "YTA.  You didn\u2019t know, but you still ruined the twist for her. \n\nA twist is finished you done see it coming.  It\u2019s also fun if you figure it out on your own.  It\u2019s neither of someone spoils it for you.\n\nUnless you have established that you two are the kind the theorize about movies ahead of time, then yes, you are an asshole.  \n\nWhat positive outcome did you expect her to get from you saying that?  You just wanted an ego boost.", "NTA", "Back when I was younger and going all the time with friends, I was always able to call twists, and it was kinda part of the fun. \"Ha! Told ya!\" I dont get the people that just want to watch a movie WITH people and then get upset over said people opining over what they think is going on.", "To be fair it's only a spoiler if you knew. Otherwise every redditor that guesses right about something even months or years in advance of something releasing spoiled something.", "I skip previews at the end of the episode and do my best to skip trailers for movies and theatre shows.

I have been asked to leave the room so my daughter and husband can watch the previews.   Cool.  Happy to do so.", "Agreed. I hate when people treat movies like it's something to outsmart; like they are winning if they can guess the plot twists and endings. It really ruins the movie for those of us who want to escape reality for a couple of hours and enjoy the plot unfolding. Keep your thoughts to yourself unless someone asks your opinion!", "But that doesn\u2019t mean you have to say your prediction out loud", "NAH still not everyone likes to get spoiled in that way and that\u2019s fine. To me no one here is an ah. If OP continues to do this knowing the gf doesn\u2019t like it he would become one.", "But that doesn\u2019t mean he has to say it out loud.", "That doesn\u2019t answer the question. Is your girlfriend used to you telling her what you think will happen with the plot?
