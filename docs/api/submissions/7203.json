SIL sounds jealous or maybe just looking for reasons not to like you. You stated that you thanked your husbands father and seems like you just wanted to share this new positive thing in your life with others. Nothing wrong with that at all! As far as not wanting the SIL in your house, I wouldn't want someone in my house either if they couldn't respect me. A home is supposed to be a safe place and you (with your husband's agreement/support) get to decide who is welcome or unwelcome in it.
