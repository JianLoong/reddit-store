Facebook drama is so childish", "op=NTA\n\nYou have a right not to have people bully you in your own home.", "She was the a$$hole", "NTA but will your inlaws have a problem with all of this and if so, how will it impact the arrangement?", "NTA! SIL sounds jealous or maybe just looking for reasons not to like you. You stated that you thanked your husbands father and seems like you just wanted to share this new positive thing in your life with others. Nothing wrong with that at all! As far as not wanting the SIL in your house, I wouldn't want someone in my house either if they couldn't respect me. A home is supposed to be a safe place and you (with your husband's agreement/support) get to decide who is welcome or unwelcome in it. Congratulations on the home!", "I have all my family and in-laws on FB. Not anymore. My father inlaw is the only one who doesn't have FB. \nBut yes NC is best", "Agreed. NTA she sounds entitled.", "He agrees to a point. He says as it is my home as well I have every right to feel the way I do. But he has said that we just won't have her over. He does not have the best relationship with her. \nShe accused me of vilifying her to him & his response was no, that happened way before ...... came into my life. You did that all on your own .......", "Then there's no problem. You are NTA, and you didn't make this decision unilaterally, you have the support of your husband. Also, she sounds like a horrible nightmare and you're both better off without her in your home.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. This probably has nothing to do with you. Take your husband's advice, but don't blame yourself.", "NTA\n\nMute her noise.", "NTA.\n\nIt is your house. If both you and hubby agree to not let her in so be it. The reason doesn't matter.", "That's great because honestly she probably shouldn't be there even if it's just him because who knows what she'd do to your home. There's no way she wouldn't snoop around at least given the chance.", "NTA", "NTA, but worth considering the path forward and a restorative resolution for the situation.  Would you keep her banned in 12 months?", "YTA why post this on FB at all. Social media is the downfall of society.", "She sounds like she expected that house for herself...!", "ESH-  YTA for posting on Facebook- good or bad- never put your personal crap on social media.  No need to be embarrassed, you got a house from her father and should knowledge it.", "She\u2019s just acting catty and jealous. Block her on social media and just move on.", "NTA. \n\nThat sounds like an excellent idea.", "NTA but also,I get the feeling that sil is upset because you must have made it seem in your post that you were buying the house perhaps to impress people on Facebook?. After all buying a house in Australia at the moment means you're very well off. \nThat's just what I assume happened, apologies if it's not the case.\nI have a sil who constantly take lavish pictures in my apartment, that my mom lives, and post it on Facebook. Though she never writes anytime implying that it is her dwelling, her \"friends\" on Facebook think she's living the life! Kisses me off but I don't say anything not to stir.", "NTA. Block SIL on everything including your home. Let anyone that gets in your face they'll be added to the list. A good reason to stay off FB or keep it private. Too much Drama.", "NTA. You did nothing wrong. She is just jealous you have a better life than she does.", "NTA\n\nYour sister in law (I'll use SIL to make it simpler) sounds like she's trying to make the situation about her and what she wants. She's attacking you for defending yourself. This can be called gaslighting.\n\nGaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation in which the abuser attempts to sow self-doubt and confusion in their victim\u2019s mind. Typically, gaslighters are seeking to gain power and control over the other person, by distorting reality and forcing them to question their own judgment and intuition.\n\nThere's a sub called r/raisedbynarcissists. Your SIL clearly isn't your parent and doesn't have to be a narcissist for you to get helpful information from the forum. Narcissists are simply an extreme form of 'all about me' and reading obvious examples with well thought out advice can help people understand their own situation.\n\nBesides that, relationships are give and take. SiL is only taking taking taking. What about you? What about what you want?\n\nHumans can become comfortable in their dysfunction. If they have no reason to change their behavior, they won't. If you were worth being nice to, SIL would've already stopped treating you like you were less than human.\n\nDo you think she'd ever give you an actual apology? Would she be sorry for doing something or be sorry for being caught doing something? Would she blame someone else or take responsibility?\n\nPeople show you how you should treat them. Unless someone has a very clearly diagnosed issue, then they should be held to the same standard as any adult. If they're not choosing to stop their behavior, then they're purposefully choosing what they want and to be a cruel person.\n\nImo, just stop interacting with SIL. Don't let her in the house because she's just going to try her bullying. She's not worth it. Let her burn herself out like a toddler throwing a tantrum. If she makes a fuss, just say you're not interacting with someone who attacked you.\n\nSome people say stupid things like oh that's just how she is or don't rock the boat. That's stupid. You're not responsible for someone else's emotions. Some people need to recontextualize a situation to understand it. Take away SIL and put in friend or cousin. Would a friend get away with SILs behavior? Why does SIL get to get away with it?\n\nIf you're uncertain about the situation, get a notebook or your computer and type/write out everything that you feel about her and what she's possibly done to you. Don't do it neatly, just word vomit and written everything that comes to mind.\n\nWhen you're done, parse it out. Simplify it now you feel it should be. Maybe take a break if you need to. When you're done, you'll have your evidence of SILS behavior and your own reasoning. Read it and have your husband read it. Then, decide if you want to interact based on how SIL has treated you.", "NTA but stop letting jerks on your fb page. That drama was preventable. Once you discover the peace and joy of not feeling obligated to be friends with family on social media, you\u2019ll never go back. \n\nI have like 50 fb friends and two family members only. My mom and my cousin. The rest can get bent and some are blocked. Do it. I promise you\u2019ll feel so free.", "Proud of you for lasting 10 minutes!\nAnd of course NTA", "Ones right to respect imo is earned by humble\\~ness not by how much an arse you are to those around you. This SIL is clearly selfishly unhinged.", "NTA", "NTA.  Block her on your phone and block her on any social media accounts - and remember to check on your privacy settings.\n\nGreat that your hubby backs you up.", "Your SIL is in the wrong but probably not the best idea to post about a new free house on Facebook.", "All OP did was express excitement for a new home, how did you turn that into bragging about a new free house?", "Never said bragging. I think even if you buy a new home, posting about it on social media is distasteful. I get that most people use social media in this way to share about exciting life moments. But share those things with your friends and family privately. Broadcasting it to a huge audience invites negativity into your life like this situation.", ">But share those things with your friends and family privately.\n\nHmm I wonder what category a sister in law falls under", "Obviously the SIL would know about this situation regardless. And obviously op has a contentious relationship with her SIL and is probably not reaching out to her to have heartfelt convos. I didn't say every friend and family member, which is often what social media is. I should've said \"your close circle of people who you know will probably be happy for you.\""]}
