My mom requested taking me out on Saturday so we could have a mother daughter type bonding day. I was fine with this and so was my dad, and so me and my mom planned to go to a mall. I'm the oldest of three kids, and when we go shopping, I never get time to look at clothes I want, and never as long as I would like. So I was very excited to go to the mall with my mom and shop to my hearts content. Until she started asking me what else I wanted to do. She would strongly suggest things like rock climbing, or canoeing down a river, and I knew she just didn't want to spend all her time at the mall. I shut them down, explaining that I really wanted time to shop for myself so maybe I might find some good clothing. But it didn't end there. Later in the week, her boyfriend came over, and my mom decided it would be great to bring him along, too. And here's the thing. My mom's boyfriend is a nice guy, and I didn't have any problems with him coming,  infact, I was hoping if he showed up then he would distract my mom and I would be free to shop. But instead, they BOTH made it their mindset to come up with the \"quirkiest\" thing to do. So instead of going to the mall all day as I want, my mom and her boyfriend were trying to convince me to go to drag queen bingo (??) And don't get me wrong, I love drag queens, but the bingo is a no. And when I refused that, she said she understood. We didn't talk about it until this morning, when she asked me if I wanted to do Japanese karaoke with her and her boyfriend when we were supposed to be at the mall. I said no, and she brought up the drag queen bingo again, and I was getting upset. I just looked away and didn't say anything to her. She asked me if she was pissing me off and I kind of just laughed and said yeah. So later we get to my dads house and she is next to me near the door. She says \"sorry for ruining your life\" and just leaves at that. I feel bad for shutting down all of her ideas, but I feel like it's my day and I should get to decide.", "created_utc": 1683890277, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13fi718/aita_for_shutting_down_all_of_my_moms_party_ideas/", "score": 98, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her mom just obviously didn\u2019t want to that.

You clearly said what you wanted to do, for just one day, your birthday and yet still she kept giving ideas of the things she wanted. \nI\u2019d just ask for the cash and say I\u2019ll go on my own if you don\u2019t want to come, because she clearly wants to do something else. NTA", "NTA. And your mom is a joke for that piss poor attempt at guilt shaming. If she didn\u2019t want to \u201cruin your life\u201d maybe she should just listen to you?", "NTA. She\u2019s trying way to hard to suggest things that she thinks might be fun ways to spend time together. \n\nJust take some time to think things over and realize that by just wanting to go shopping at the mall, you may not have clearly expressed that you were more than happy just doing that for the entire day. \n\nShe may have felt that it was underwhelming not realizing that for you, being able to put some outfits together and taking your time browsing was really what you were looking forward too, but having an additional option doesn\u2019t hurt because sometimes the mall comes up short.", "NTA. This is a communication and respect issue. She\u2019s not respecting what you are telling her. She\u2019s saying she\u2019ll agree to the mall, which is what you want to do, but then manipulating you so she can do what she wants instead. I\u2019m guessing this isn\u2019t the first thing. It\u2019s your birthday and you should get to choose how you spend the day. Try to explain that to your mom but it sounds like it falls on deaf ears", "NTA\nYou said what you wanted to do and that you santed to just that. You're mom was trying hard to make the day fun which was understandable but then she acted really immature.", "Drag queen bingo is at night. Obviously you won't feel like doing much of anything after you go shopping, except maybe dinner. But it really isn't going to interfere with your shopping. I'm surprised her boyfriend wants to come along. Doesn't seem like taking a kid shopping is going to be fun. Separate thing: I wonder if budgeting for clothes is an issue. The mall is super expensive and kids don't tend to understand budgeting.  Shopping all day sounds super expensive.", "[deleted]", "How long do you possibly need to shop?

Your mother needs to learn to listen to you.\n\nI have to admit I'm not too keen on her inviting her bf to attend something that was specifically requested as a mother daughter bonding day.\n\nI wonder how many of these events are things her abd/or her bf wanted to do already and are trying to kill two birds with the one stone. So to speak.\n\nThe last comment your mother made was a very AH thing to say. Emotionally manipulating a child like that is gross behaviour from a parent.", "NTA Sweetie, you've tried to talk with your mom about what you wanted for your birthday and she didn't listen. I'm sorry. It was a immature temper tantrum for her to say what she said to you before she left you at your dad's.\n\nIf she won't listen maybe write her an email or show her this post.", "NTA. If she wants a mother-daughter bonding day, she should not be involving her boyfriend, and skewing the conversation towards their interests or what they think your interests should be.", "NTA. Did your dad hear her comment?", "NTA. Started out to be your day. Then she decided it was going to hers. Next time just asks for cash. Then your free to do what you want with friends.", "Even, \u201cyour first idea was perfect. I look forward to going to the mall with time to enjoy shopping.\u201d", "Drag Queen bingo doesn't seem like the best idea to bring up to a 13 year old.", "Her mom is suggesting things/events that, presumably, cost money to attend.

It\u2019s not like she was asking for a grand party, her mom could\u2019ve not been selfish for one day", "Yeah but the OP explicitly stated what they wanted to do on their birthday. The mother didn't feel like it was enough but it's not her day and not her choice.", "Could the mom not force her daughter into doing shit she doesn\u2019t want to just bc the mom can\u2019t have one day not about mom?", "So OP should spend her birthday doing something her mother and her boyfriend want? Why call it a celebration for her then?", "I totally get mom's position here though, an entire day at the mall sounds like torture. She was happy to take OP to the mall, she wants to spend time with OP, but she doesn't want to spend the *entire day* at the mall shopping. \n\nAlso, incidentally, how much money is 13 year old OP expecting mom to spend here? Yeesh.\n\nI get that it's OP's birthday, but the only bonding I see going on is between mom and her BF as they try to keep themselves from going comatose from boredom.", "Nope. It reeks of \u2018trying to hard to be the cool mom\u2019\u2026", "I completely agree with you on this! It's important for parents to understand that they need to respect their children's wishes and give them the space to make decisions according to their own preferences and interests. Forcing them to do something just because it serves the parent's interests is a huge disservice to the child's wellbeing and can lead to resentment and strained relationships. Parents need to prioritize their children's autonomy and respect their choices, even if it means sacrificing their own desires sometimes.", "spending a few hours at the mall is not going to kill her mother", "I have such strong feelings about this bc one year MY mom tricked me on my birthday, said she was going to take me out flower shopping, turns out it was flower shopping for her garden and I wasn\u2019t allowed to touch anything.. so. I really want other parents to avoid treating their kids the same lmao", "NTA she\u2019s guilt tripping you to get her way", "NTA but just spend your birthday with your dad.

OP told her what she wanted to do. Mom refused to listen and then got snarky with it", "NTA.\n\nI mean for starters 100% of my experience of drag queen bingo and japanese karaoke has taken place in bars which aren't a super fun environment for people way too young to drink, even if locally you are allowed to go in.  And \"sorry for ruining your life\" is a really passive-aggressive pity-me way to say \"sorry for ruining your day.\"  Your mom was being awful.", "NTA see what you did \u2018wrong\u2019 here was not let Your birthday be about what She wanted to do and what she wanted to tell her friends you did so she could seem like \u2018such a cool mom\u2019. \n\nNo honey You didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA", "NTA\nMy mom is like that. Does only what she wants but tries to convince/manipulate that it is what you want. Big narcissist she is. Only strong boundaries has made her tolerable.\n\nAlso the favorite, \"sorry for ruining your life\", similar to \"sorry I'm the worst mother\" etc. Anything to be the victim and manipulate into doing what she wants. \n\nNo idea if your mom is full blown narc, but how she acted in your description points to it. \n\nJust reiterate, using a tone that cannot be used against you, what you want. You can tell her she can do that stuff another time or go alone with her bf later. If you act upset (which makes her feel like she did something bad) she will turn up the guilt because they can never be wrong. Don't worry about trying to please her or fall for the guilt, but understand how she can use it on you. Tell her you appreciate all of her \"wonderful\" suggestions, but you only want to go to the mall right now, but maybe another time or year. Also if you have a good relationship with your dad, let him in on what's going on. \n\nGood luck kid, happy birthday.", "Offer to just have her give you money and you'll go by yourself.  Maybe then she'll get it.  Having a few hours of just \"Mom and Me\" time is a small ask.  NTA and happy birthday!!", "So besides the mall what other suggestions did you give? I think at this point you are intentionally not helping the situation. ESH", "INFO:  Is it possible that something changed and your mom suddenly realized she couldn't afford to let you shop all day?  It sounds to me like she's suggesting things that are more affordable.  Maybe you two can have a conversation about what's really going on.", "NTA, that last comment from her makes her sound like a major drama queen. Be direct with her as to what you want and do not settle!", "I like taking my kid to the mall because it\u2019s really easy for me to find out what her current interests are. Trying to get a 12 year old to tell me what she\u2019s into is hard, most of the time she just shrugs when I ask what she\u2019s into. It\u2019s harder to hide when she sees something she wants at the store and that leads to a conversation about it.", "What mean girl vibe?", "NTA - her saying that is to guilt OP and make herself the victim. She is still expecting her to acquiesce. Her 13 is more mature than her.", "I would like to spend a good bit of time at a mall, also the mall was mother\u2019s idea in the first place.", "I'd be bored to death spending all day at the mall, but mum offered, so needs to put up and shut up rather than try and change OP's mindand be passive aggressive. Mum is not modelling emotionally mature behaviour here.", "It's not going to be a mother daughter bonding experience either. You don't bond with people by forcing them to do stuff they don't like. OP's mom was trying to find something they could both enjoy and she was a little pushy about it, OP only wants to do what she wants to do. Which is fine, it's her birthday, but let's not frame this as 'bonding'. \n\nAlso, like I mentioned, a 13 year old's expectation to shop all day at the mall is going to have a cost associated, a pretty hefty one, and we have no idea what they financial situation is like (probably not awful if mom's happy to pay for these other outings, but designer clothes are an order of magnitude more expensive)."]}
