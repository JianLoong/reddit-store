I'm the oldest of three kids, and when we go shopping, I never get time to look at clothes I want, and never as long as I would like. So I was very excited to go to the mall with my mom and shop to my hearts content. Until she started asking me what else I wanted to do. She would strongly suggest things like rock climbing, or canoeing down a river, and I knew she just didn't want to spend all her time at the mall. I shut them down, explaining that I really wanted time to shop for myself so maybe I might find some good clothing. But it didn't end there. Later in the week, her boyfriend came over, and my mom decided it would be great to bring him along, too. And here's the thing. My mom's boyfriend is a nice guy, and I didn't have any problems with him coming,  infact, I was hoping if he showed up then he would distract my mom and I would be free to shop. But instead, they BOTH made it their mindset to come up with the \"quirkiest\" thing to do. So instead of going to the mall all day as I want, my mom and her boyfriend were trying to convince me to go to drag queen bingo (??) And don't get me wrong, I love drag queens, but the bingo is a no. And when I refused that, she said she understood. We didn't talk about it until this morning, when she asked me if I wanted to do Japanese karaoke with her and her boyfriend when we were supposed to be at the mall. I said no, and she brought up the drag queen bingo again, and I was getting upset. I just looked away and didn't say anything to her. She asked me if she was pissing me off and I kind of just laughed and said yeah. So later we get to my dads house and she is next to me near the door.

It's important for parents to understand that they need to respect their children's wishes and give them the space to make decisions according to their own preferences and interests.

You can tell her she can do that stuff another time or go alone with her bf later. If you act upset (which makes her feel like she did something bad) she will turn up the guilt because they can never be wrong.

OP's mom agreed to spend the day at the mall. Then invited her bf along and is continuously trying to change yet more of the plan. When OP declines, mom tries to guiltrip them into doing something they don't like. If she didn't want to spend the day at the mall, she should have said so before agreeing. \n\n\"A little pushy\", ah yes claiming to have ruined your kids life because they dont want to do bingo or karaoke with their mom and her bf is only a LITTLE pushy", "> We put up with things we don't enjoy for the people we love.

She kept suggesting different things and suggested one thing twice (gasp). OP shut them down and got pissy about it, then mom got pissy in return (which was her only real AH move, stooping to the level of a 13 year old). \n\nAgain, none of those activities cost as much as a single jacket from a designer store, much less a whole day of shopping at a mall. \n\nLike I said, I get why mom was frustrated. She was pulling out all the stops trying to find something fun they could do *together* and OP was in typical teenager mode. I don't blame OP for that and I do think mom was the AH for her parting shot, which was over the top, but I fully get the frustration.", "Where do you see the word \u201cdesigner\u201d in OP\u2019s post? She can probably buy multiple outfits at forever 21 for what it would cost to go canoeing, rock climbing or tipping the queens at bingo. \n\nIf Mom hates going to the mall that much she should have vetoed it from the get go.

Especially if want a bonding day with a kid.", "NTA.  But maybe your Mom feels like just shopping at the mall isn't special enough for your 13th birthday.  You should tell her that what you really want is to spend the day at the mall and that you don't need anything else for the day to be special.  Sometimes the simple things seem too simple to parents, and we try to hard to make things perfect and don't get the message. Spell it out for her.", "Are you sure your mom isn't the one turning 13? It sounds like she wants an activity for herself, and your birthday is just an excuse to spend the money. Her little \"sorry for ruining your life\" quip was super melodramatic. If she acts like this often, you may want to wander into the subs regarding narcissist parents to see if it fits.\n\nStill, even if it's your day, consideration must be made for one's companions. \n\nIf by \"all day\" you mean 4-6 hours in the mall....then yeah, birthday or not, that's not going to be fun for anyone but the most ardent of shoppers, no matter how much they like you. \n\nKeeping it to 2-3 hours, then proposing you go somewhere for lunch and doing something different in the afternoon, like spa stuff, would be a reasonable accommodation. \n\nOr if you absolutely must spend the entire day in the mall, proposing you go alone (as a test of your new, mature age) or with friends, and meet mom for dinner or something after as your \"bonding\" activity would also work.\n\nTrying to force people to do exactly what we want when we know they won't enjoy it leads to a bad time had by all, since both parties will be resentful. \n\nI'm not saying you have to be so accommodating you don't get to do what you want, but try and find a happy path between you hating drag queen bingo and her hating all day at the mall.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nWhat\u2019s the point of asking you what you want to do for your birthday if she\u2019s trying to make you go with her choices?", "Yeah your mom is TA.

You\u2019re acting like she wanted to buy the most expensive item in every store.", "NTA sounds like your mom wants to have her fun more than she wants to celebrate you.", "NTA. make sure to get your mom a crown for her birthday cause she's the DRAMA QUEEN!", "Well said. NTA", "YTA.  You are old enough to be able to have an honest discussion with your mom, you did not do that.", "NTA, and it was absurdly childish of her to say what she did. You're handling this with such grace and maturity, I'm honestly kind of stunned that a woman who would say something like that had a hand in raising you.", "NTA.\n\nI'm sorry that you are more mature at 13, than your mother is at whatever advanced age she is.\n\nIt's your birthday and mom and her boyfriend should be ashamed of themselves for trying to make it all about them and their \"quirkiness.\" It honestly just comes off as them being massive pains in the ass - sorry you have to put up with that.", "break down OP's statement about her no;\n\nbingo=bad  \ndrag show=good  \n\n\nthe only thing *drag* about it was its not clothes shopping, and shes too young for bingo", "NTA\n\nYou made plans with her.
