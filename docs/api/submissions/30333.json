But personally, I would fess up eventually and say that you haven\u2019t been intimate with him, you were yanking his chain after he dehumanized you. And tell them that they are all suckers for believing any of it. (And obviously they are also AH for bullying him)", "Girl, ***he*** started a rumor about ***you***. \n\nIt was malicious. Obviously so. You called him out and asked him to grow up and either fix his blatant mistake or make good for violating your trust and embarrassing you. \n\nHe chose neither. The consequences are, in my opinion, far too light. \n\nBottom line: he\u2019s a fucking creep. If he made up a rumor about the two of you doing stuff y\u2019all didn\u2019t do and that wasn\u2019t fully consented to by all parties (including you), and he gets away with it, then he gets taught that it\u2019s okay for him to be a creep. It\u2019s not. \n\nYou\u2019ve done the world a favor teaching him that it\u2019s never okay to be a creep. Side note: good on you for not going after his sexuality, raising (hygiene), or physical hurdles, and you didn\u2019t falsely accuse SA (although there is an argument to be made that he assaulted you, just not physically). \n\nBut, following your own rules, you could have made it hurt a *whole helluva lot* more than you did before you\u2019re even close to the asshole territory. \n\nAt your age, yes, it is hard to deny the claims and be believed. That said, a completely legitimate route would have been full honesty. But I mean ***full*** honesty. Not just \u201cno we didn\u2019t,\u201d but rather \u201chell no, I would never, and this is why:\u201d", "Ha, no! It wasn't too far. It was not far enough. Although no, don't add something different to it now. Stick with it because otherwise it will become unbelievable. And you stick by it even when you speak with him: \"What are you talking about? Please, leave me alone! The whole thing was a mistake but... you know you crying like this, I just pitied you and thought maybe, if I give him head he will get a little better. That was dumb, I know but you know what? I didn't sign up for your weird role play. It just should be a pity head.\" Just imagine you're an actor and it is method acting. \n\nNot only will it drive him crazy but you make sure should ever anyone overhear such a talk the gossip goes on. And if others mention it to you the same. Tell them: \"Yeah... you know, I was dumb but you guys were so mean and made him cry and I felt so sorry for him. How could I know he was into **that** stuff?! I just wanted to give him a little head out of pity, you know, I just can not watch someone I care for crying like that. I mean he was really down, I could barely understand his sobbing - you really shouldn't be like that to him that's not ok - but him telling me how he will die a virgin and all and obviously, I would not sleep with him, so I thought, ok... just to sheer him up or something but honestly, he went too far. I mean just imagine... being called mummy the whole time \"Mummy... tell me I am your good little boy, I do well mummy, don't I... oh yes mummy, my whole life I only wanted this\" by your good friend while you're heaving his dick in your mouth. That's just... that felt so dehumanising and kinda pervert. Just, you know... I know his mum and imagining her giving him head... no worse, knowing that is what he was imagining right then. That was creepy. I tell you I learnt my lesson for sure.\"\n\nDive into your damn role, girl, feel it and play it with pride, lol.", "No! Fuck that guy (not literally). That shit is not ok.\n\nHe can convince his own friends that he was lying all along. It\u2019s his problem.\n\nKudos for the creative solution \ud83d\udc4d", "He has the chance to fix this by coming clean that you BOTH lied. If he admits to the original lie, I think it's fair that you come clean as well. If he doesn't, he has no right to demand anything from you.", "He started it by lying that you gave him a blow job. He's a coward who deserved it.", "But why should you, the OP, have it follow YOU to college!?  NTA at all", "Haha. She should start calling him \"Stumpy\" and say it was so hard tring to keep hold of that little button with how short it was.", "Also \u201ehe wanted me to put a finger in his ass.\u201c \n\nAlso no shame about that but I know the frail ego of such guys would shatter.", "As a guy, I can confirm, we are aware, even as teenagers.    That's why I never spoke about sex with my girlfriends to my friends.  I just told them none of their business.  Then I got friends that didn't ask stupid questions like that.    In my experience, the \"friends\" giving Jared grief we're likely virgins themselves.  And then with the behavior they learn, they grow up to be incels because no one wants to date idiots like that.", "And if she COULD get kicked out of her house for premarital sex, even if just an unproven rumor, how did OP help herself? Literally that\u2019s entirely illogical. That would be admitting to sex she didn\u2019t have, to hurt someone else who hurt her. Is a few minutes of satisfaction about getting revenge worth homelessness? Lmfaooooo y\u2019all need to grow up.", "You are correct! But HS is ruthless, and he would've gotten tons of shit for it", "I can't speak to the specific social dynamics of your school, so I can't really make a recommendation on what would have solved your problem. But, I can say that making up a \"weird\" kink for Jared was not helpful (for you or him). \n\nPersonally, I would have just been insistent that Jared had lied and waited for it to die down. But, I also understand that isn't exactly a fun (edit: to endure) solution. So, I understand why you handled it the way you did.", "Yeah, I'm being downvoted. But, I stand by my vote. So it goes...", "Exactly. So, Jared doesn't like having lies about him and his sexuality spread around? Yeah, that's really annoying when people do that. So annoying.", "Thank you do you have a link for the tweet because I was trying to quote it to Emily and couldn't find it?", "Keanu Reaves in a Miku binder", "I don't see why she owes him honesty when he refuses to tell the truth. If he comes clean then people would know she was lying anyway", "Fingerjob not a handjob (pinch thumb and index finger tips together)", "That's brutal. And I totally agree.", "LOL - now 'Stumpy' would be something that followed him to college \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "It not applying in OP's case doesn't mean his lie couldn't have hurt another girl whose situation was more reliant on puritan ideals.\n\nHopefully getting ripped on for a few months will stop him from future lies and the internet story will remind other young men and women that lies can bite them in the ass.", "Also, sorry, but if you\u2019re upset that people think you\u2019re having sex and then lie to make them look bad (people are allowed to have kinks and the people calling it \u201cincest\u201d when it\u2019s clearly referencing a kink must be having boring AF sex lmfaooooo) that???? That doesn\u2019t help you???? OP was upset that he lied and said they had sex. OP couldn\u2019t heal the thing that hurt her, so she lied about him too. It\u2019s true, two wrongs don\u2019t make a right. And like we can think his behavior was disgusting without being as psycho as some commenters on here giving OP ideas of even more cruel things to say! Most of the people commenting here are massive bullies and it\u2019s shameful. I\u2019m a literal sexual assault survivor and can say without a single doubt that NOTHING feels as good as being the bigger person, creating time and space between someone who has hurt you, and just moving the fuck on with life. I know he tells lies about me because my mom saw HIS DAD telling lies about me on Facebook, but I simply don\u2019t give a shit or try to find out anymore. People who know me, don\u2019t believe him. People who believe him aren\u2019t worth a fraction of my gddamn energy. The younger OP can take that attitude to heart, the better her life will be.", "Don't feel guilty. He could have fixed it. He could have come clean. But nooo, he rather have them tease you and make comments about you.\n Hopefully he has learned never to mess with you or any other woman in the future.", "I know what you are talking about too, but i don't have a link.  I think i saw a screen shot on FB because i'm not on twitter.   \n\nJust tell Jared \"Don't start none, won't be none\".  This whole mess is his doing.", "Maybe tell him to give up and start clam slamming..."]}
