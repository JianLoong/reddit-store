I don't actually remember them together. My dad met my stepmom when I was 6. My stepmom tried to fill a second mom role and my dad tried to facilitate that. At times it meant them asking my mom to let me go someplace with them on her time or trying to get a Mother's Day celebration in. I know it hurt my mom, the thought of sharing the role as my mom. She never said anything. She never discouraged me at all. But there are always ways to tell if you know someone well enough and pay enough attention. I want to reiterate, my mom NEVER interfered or said anything against my stepmom or dad. My noticing could be the reason I'm not closer to my stepmom. Though I definitely don't despise her or see her as nothing. But a second mom is not something I ever considered her as. I do like her though.\n\nFor my wedding planning and dress appointments, etc. I wanted to make it small and something for just me and my mom. I wanted the experience with her anyway but I also wanted to give her something she doesn't have to share with my stepmom. This became more of a thing when my grandma and great aunt, on my dad's side, called my stepmom mother of the bride on FB and the three commented that it would be a great experience for her to see me pick a dress and stuff. After seeing that I went to my stepmom (and dad technically) and told her I didn't want to give her a role as mom of the bride and she wouldn't be doing the traditional mom of the bride stuff with me (dress shopping and fittings). I told her we could figure something else out. Asked was there anything else she'd want to tag along for. Like looking at flowers. She was sad and asked me why I didn't want her as the second mom of the bride. I told her I wanted that for just my mom. Dad then brings up that my mom won't mind and she'd want me to have both my mom's there. I told him he was wrong. That she only ever agreed to share it because she felt it was the right thing to do but it hurt her. He looked stunned and asked how I knew. I told him those close to her always knew. He then said he never would have expected that from her because she was always the perfect parent and person and that was why they ended up divorcing, because he couldn't handle it and was envious of her. I told him nobody is perfect and it's unfair for him to expect my mom to be. I asked him if he'd be happy to be one of my dad's. He said of course not but he always thought mom would be better than him.\n\nThe whole conversation left my dad and stepmom with rough feelings and she made it clear she was upset that after all these years I wouldn't give her the love and respect to be included as a mom of the bride.\n\nAlso, I have spoken to my mom about the overall topic before. She has never admitted it but always said she wanted the best for me and for me to be happy. Her best friend confirmed it for me though.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680171224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126ifdo/aita_for_telling_my_stepmom_i_dont_want_to/", "score": 5256, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It was beautiful.\n\nNow, I wasn't included in anything, well, except for the chores of driving around for hours multiple times, picking up and delivering the stuff she had ordered (tables/chairs/decorations/etc), and then taking rental stuff back and cleaning up.

But for a dress fitting and try on? What about your mother-in-law? Is she also not invited? My stepmom, although she didn't \"raise me,\" is still another mother figure in my life and deserves respect. My parents divorced when I was 15, not even 5.

But I'm not sure if your situation is like mine, maybe you only saw her every other weekend or every once in a while. What was your situation like? The reason I ask is that I am doing more work than both of my stepson's bioparents. You BET I would be terribly offended if he decided not to include me in a special moment (within reason). Would I say anything? To my husband, yes, but to him, no. But that would be the day my relationship changed with him forever. It would make me feel majorly underappreciated for basically stepping in FOR HIS MOM (both financially and parenting duties), who is still in the picture. But I will be real...his mom and my husband would NEVER allow him to not include me, she would be my biggest advocate. \n\nAlso, why is your mom hurt by your stepmom \"trying to be a mom figure\"? It makes me sad and confused when parents are so upset by another person coming in and being a supplemental parent and help with their child.  What happened between your parents to, supposedly, cause so much hurt on your mom's side? \n\nEveryone gets so bent out of shape when the stepparent supposedly doesn't want a relationship with the kid or has conditional love, but the moment the kid doesn't want a relationship or treats their stepparent poorly, they get praised or told \"no, it's ok, stepparents are monsters always\". Such a double standard around here.\n\nEdit: Just want to clear up that, as a stepparent, I wouldn't step on my stepson's mom's toes in anything having to do with mother of the groom, but I'd be a bit hurt to not be included in other things.

OP's stepmother has been with her since she was a small child, so to completely dismiss her is kind of rude, imo.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Also being a step parent isn't a bad thing but you have to understand you aren't a parent if that kid doesn't want it. \n\nWhich is why the stepmother should just go on with life. I wouldn't bother to help with the wedding, wedding reception, or even give gifts or a raggedy ass congratulations card. I wouldn't even show up at the wedding.\n\nAfterwards, I would let the daughter live her best married life and simply wouldn't be bothered with her. We wouldn't even have to acknowledge each other.", "I agree. My mom was the stepmother and when my oldest half brother got married she was always mad she wasn't included in the wedding planning. But like.. 1, she would be step mother of the groom, and 2, she still isn't his *mom*. At least she asked if she should have a special dress instead if assuming, but the petty complaining bothered me", "Stop projecting.she isn't wrong or an asshole for wanting to do something with just her and her mom", "People feel how they feel. If OP had wanted her stepmother to be another MOB at the wedding, then her own mother would have had to handle it. \n\n*And I cannot wrap my head around women who selfishly don\u2019t want another woman to help care for their kids.*\n\nI can't wrap my head around women who intentionally erase the stepchild's mother from the picture. The best parent/ stepparent relationships are based on mutual respect. Stepmother  was acting as if OP's own mother wasn't in the picture.", "I, also as a child of divorce, disagree in everything that you say. \n\nThose kind of experiences are different for everyone. So saying that you \"couldn't imagine women who selfishly don't want another woman to help care for their kids\" is both narrowminded and it twists the story OP told.\n\nYou can't force a bond, simple as that. And it has   nothing to do with OP's mother, is what OP herself feels. And she just didn't bond with her stepmother that way.\n\nAlso, her father is being pretty double standard with his response to the situation.", "Probably not, considering that she was oblivious enough to expect a Mother-of- the-bride role", "\u201cMy wife is better than me so I need to go find someone worse to make myself feel better\u201d omg seriously \ud83d\ude12", "I wouldn't necessarily interpret it like that. The doormat comment was off beam, but for me, I can read the \"enabling\" not so much enabling in the traditional sense, but more like the story about two women who came before Solomon claiming that the baby was theirs. The mother's graciousness, selflessness, and love for her daughter left her vulnerable to her ex's power moves. Because she wanted to keep her child in one piece (emotionally/psychologically), she opted to forego boundaries that would have protected herself, but at the expense of her child's comfort and well-being. She saw that allowing the stepmother undue access was better than tearing the child in two.", "It's quite hilarious how so many of you resort to claims that someone is resentful and bitter just because they have a difference of opinion. It's not that serious. Don't take it so personal, love. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Just because you haven't seen/experienced it doesn't mean they don't exist.\n\nI've seen enough to know that positive stepparent relationships are an exception to the norm.", "I know it's not her fault, but the comments above me sound like they're blaming her", "Soooooo you just like to argue. Got it. Because the OP's said none of the things you are reaching for. Good day.", "but exceptions still exist?", "The comments are more about him than her. He takes advantage of her generosity and kindness."]}
