I don't actually remember them together. My dad met my stepmom when I was 6. My stepmom tried to fill a second mom role and my dad tried to facilitate that. At times it meant them asking my mom to let me go someplace with them on her time or trying to get a Mother's Day celebration in. I know it hurt my mom, the thought of sharing the role as my mom. She never said anything. She never discouraged me at all. But there are always ways to tell if you know someone well enough and pay enough attention. I want to reiterate, my mom NEVER interfered or said anything against my stepmom or dad. My noticing could be the reason I'm not closer to my stepmom. Though I definitely don't despise her or see her as nothing. But a second mom is not something I ever considered her as. I do like her though.\n\nFor my wedding planning and dress appointments, etc. I wanted to make it small and something for just me and my mom. I wanted the experience with her anyway but I also wanted to give her something she doesn't have to share with my stepmom. This became more of a thing when my grandma and great aunt, on my dad's side, called my stepmom mother of the bride on FB and the three commented that it would be a great experience for her to see me pick a dress and stuff. After seeing that I went to my stepmom (and dad technically) and told her I didn't want to give her a role as mom of the bride and she wouldn't be doing the traditional mom of the bride stuff with me (dress shopping and fittings). I told her we could figure something else out. Asked was there anything else she'd want to tag along for. Like looking at flowers. She was sad and asked me why I didn't want her as the second mom of the bride. I told her I wanted that for just my mom. Dad then brings up that my mom won't mind and she'd want me to have both my mom's there. I told him he was wrong. That she only ever agreed to share it because she felt it was the right thing to do but it hurt her. He looked stunned and asked how I knew. I told him those close to her always knew. He then said he never would have expected that from her because she was always the perfect parent and person and that was why they ended up divorcing, because he couldn't handle it and was envious of her. I told him nobody is perfect and it's unfair for him to expect my mom to be. I asked him if he'd be happy to be one of my dad's. He said of course not but he always thought mom would be better than him.\n\nThe whole conversation left my dad and stepmom with rough feelings and she made it clear she was upset that after all these years I wouldn't give her the love and respect to be included as a mom of the bride.\n\nAlso, I have spoken to my mom about the overall topic before. She has never admitted it but always said she wanted the best for me and for me to be happy. Her best friend confirmed it for me though.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680171224, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126ifdo/aita_for_telling_my_stepmom_i_dont_want_to/", "score": 1209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But I also think that with children it's very important to not have an ego about things like that especially in shared custody situations. I understand why you would want to do that just for her. I think it was a fair compromise to maybe pick out and do a few things with just your stepmom to show her that you really value her. I think that maybe there needs to be another talk and that needs to be explained objectively. Mostly that there is room in your heart for both of them and that both of them are your mom's but that there are certain things that you know are important to her and that you would like to have a bit of a compromise with that so that everybody can be loved and acknowledged without stepping on toes.

Now fast forward and my daughter has 2 mom's and I don't bad mouth her dad or stepmom but my daughter has already stated that it will be me and her step-dad filling those roles because we are the ones raising her.

Now - no step-parent, however involved or good in that child\u2019s life, would\u2019ve gone onto that stage if said child has a fully involved living parent (eg a stepmom would\u2019ve never felt inclined or invited to join the stage if the mom was living and fully participating and involved in the child\u2019s life). \n\nI\u2019m sure there are plenty of situations where stepparents ARE involved to the same degree as bio-parents are, but it really stands on the what the child of said parents wants too.\n\nIn this case, the stepparent is not seen as the 2nd mom by the now grown child. Furthermore, the bride does not want to involve said stepparent and even if the stepmom had been a mom-ish figure in her life - if she didn\u2019t want her to be considered as the \u201cmother of the bride\u201d, she has the full right to say so.", "My aunt married a widower with a young kid and she never forced herself into mom stuff my cousin wasn't comfortable with.
