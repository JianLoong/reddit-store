At times it meant them asking my mom to let me go someplace with them on her time or trying to get a Mother's Day celebration in. I know it hurt my mom, the thought of sharing the role as my mom.

I want to reiterate, my mom NEVER interfered or said anything against my stepmom or dad. My noticing could be the reason I'm not closer to my stepmom.

She was sad and asked me why I didn't want her as the second mom of the bride. I told her I wanted that for just my mom. Dad then brings up that my mom won't mind and she'd want me to have both my mom's there. I told him he was wrong. That she only ever agreed to share it because she felt it was the right thing to do but it hurt her. He looked stunned and asked how I knew. I told him those close to her always knew. He then said he never would have expected that from her because she was always the perfect parent and person and that was why they ended up divorcing, because he couldn't handle it and was envious of her. I told him nobody is perfect and it's unfair for him to expect my mom to be. I asked him if he'd be happy to be one of my dad's. He said of course not but he always thought mom would be better than him.\n\nThe whole conversation left my dad and stepmom with rough feelings and she made it clear she was upset that after all these years I wouldn't give her the love and respect to be included as a mom of the bride.\n\nAlso, I have spoken to my mom about the overall topic before.

Nobody comes close to her in my life.", "The only selfish ones I see her is OP's dad and step-mom who did not care that OP did not want her step-mom to be a second mother and kept pushing this idea on her as a child but she is not a child anymore and she gets to decide.  Keep in mind that OP asked her dad if he'd be happy to be one of her dad's et he answered, \"of course no\" so don't expect his mother to be happy to do that!", "Does he not realize what that says about his current wife? That she's fucked up and flawed enough to be acceptable to his ego??", "Really good point, instead empathy for OP\u2019s mom, they are focused on themselves.", "[deleted]", "Dad and step-mom tried to turn step-mom into second mom which op wasn't open to.", "NTA If I was your step mom I\u2019d find that comment highly offensive for a start. You own mom is too perfect so he divorced her for someone that was flawed. Says a lot about his views tbh.\n\nHe really needs to take a step back and rethink the choices he\u2019s made such as taking you away for Mother\u2019s Day, not communicating with your mom over anything etc.\n\nYour mom also needs to stand up for herself, let her know that you understand that she just wants you to be happy but a large part of your happiness relies on your mom being happy. Tell her that she is that last person you want to see upset and you want her to put herself as more of an importance in your life as she is that important to you!", "NGL OP, your dad gives off small pp energy", "You know them, but if you actually think about it, what a huge assumption, when your mother is still alive. An why the hurt feelings from stepmother?  Everyone knows its the mother of the bride, not mother plus one. Im divorced, when my daughters married, their stepmother never once assumed she woulld be part of it. Seriously take a step back, this is your mother's place all the way through, not a sharing role. An i honestly think it was discussed, im a stranger to you, an that was my first thought. Especially as the felt, bold enough to post it on social media, i guarantee all your extended family will be asking you about stepmother.", "Unless she\u2019s interested in keeping the peace on her fathers side. Sometimes life isn\u2019t about being right. Sometimes it\u2019s about preventing more drama.", "I should have worded my response more specifically, opportunities as an adult to establish that boundary.  I would never expect that it should be on a child to set or try and enforce a boundary like that.\n\nYour reaction as a child is perfectly understandable.\n\nDoes your stepmom have other children? If not maybe that\u2019s the reason they\u2019ve always been more invested in this \u201csecond mom\u201d narrative? Obviously that wouldn\u2019t be your responsibility, but maybe a reason for their behavior.", "I fully agree. Honestly one of my biggest fears is getting divorced and had to deal with potential stepmother...", "He does, he doesn't care. The question is if step mom caught on.", "I had expressed some stuff before. Like with Mother's Day, I told him I wanted to spend Mother's Day with my mom, that I didn't want to split the day or weekend between the two and I also corrected him when he took me shopping for my stepmom for Mother's Day and tried to pick out cards with mom on them. But he always kind of brushed it off and didn't listen.", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "I think what they mean is that right from the get-go of being married, dad and stepmom wanted OP to see her as a second mother and tried to make that happen.", "My mom did what she felt was right. By putting me first, by letting me have both of them even if she hated it. Most people would say that's what being a good parent is. Is not getting in the way of the relationship or minimizing the stepparents role. It did hurt her but she was willing to deal with that for my sake.\n\nFor the most part I hadn't realized just how much my stepmom thought I considered her my second mom until now. It was the post that was the real moment for me because I realized they saw it as me having just two mom's even though I never called her mom and never got her cards or anything with mom on them. I have learned from it though and also that dad can't help ever with this stuff.", "OP gave examples of her making it clear that she only considers her mom her mother and dad just brushing it off and ignoring it. Years of that kind is dismissiveness is difficult, every time she\u2019s tried to put in boundaries he\u2019s steamrolled over them. It\u2019s hardly fair to say she \u201cshould have set some boundaries by now\u201d when it\u2019s the other party who completely ignores them.", "[deleted]", "I\u2019m failing to see how it being decades later is relevant at all. Stepmom isn\u2019t entitled to any mother of the bride responsibilities just because she\u2019s been in her life for 20 years. Even less so, because when presented with the truth that their attempts to \u201cshare\u201d the role of mother was seriously hurting her mom, *still* the only thing they could focus on is how stepmom is being denied the mother of the bride role.", "[deleted]", "[removed]"]}
