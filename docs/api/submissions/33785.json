In September, I ended our convo with a message basically saying \"leave me alone and never message again\". \n\nFor some context: He was a terrible father. He would abuse my mom while my brother and I watched, he missed all our important life events, he told me I'd go to hell for being gay, he let his mom verbally abuse me, etc. When I turned 13, my mom gave me the option to go NC with him. I took it. He didn't try to reach out until I was 19. So I told him that he had his chance to be a father and that I had a better one at home and that I wanted him to leave me alone. He kept messaging. In September, we had our last convo before xmas and like I said\u2014 I told him to leave me alone again.\n\nFast forward to Xmas, he messages me while I'm opening gifts and I reply saying \"what did you not get- leave me alone\" and he sends a paragraph talking about how he's different and he helps gay people now, how I need to forgive him and 'grow from it' and everything else. I was over it- furious, I told my parents I was gonna call him- they told me I shouldn't but then I left the house and called him. That was my first time hearing his voice since I was 13, so I got a little emotional and heated on the call.\nOtp, I told him everything I ever wanted to say to him: terrible father, ruined my childhood, ruined my xmas, leave me alone, etc. I ended the call saying \"you didn't want a gay kid- you didn't want me- so now you don't have a kid\u2014 f*ck you and never reach out to me again or I'm getting a restraining order.\" I hung up on him and then blocked him everywhere for the millionth time. Ever since I went NC at 13, I've changed my entire name, hid where I went to college, and blocked him repeatedly to get away from him so this was my final straw.\n     \nAm I the asshole for saying what I did and doing what I did? I can't stop thinking I might be because it was Christmas, but then my family told me I did the right thing when I came back after the call and I'm torn.\n\nedit : i'm about to go out with a friend,  but I was noticing some recurring questions so I will answer them as an edit on this post when I get back (I don't have enough karma to comment)", "created_utc": 1703599360, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18r8rif/aita_for_telling_my_birth_father_to_go_fck/", "score": 321, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

At some point the ground is so salted nothing can grow in the aftermath.\n\nAnd even if he has changed for the better he should know him changing does nothing to change his relationship with you nor does it indebt you to give him another chance. Change should be to better himself while gaining perspective on the hurt he's done to others and needs to accept.", "NTA. If he's changed for the better and is now an LGBTQ ally, that's awesome - the more, the merrier. However, in no way does that erase what he did to you or mean that you're required to forgive & forget. What he did had a massively negative effect on you and well-wishes or games of catch can't make up for that. Forgiveness needs to come from the aggrieved, not the aggressor, and it's okay if it never comes at all. If he feels bad about it, he needs to use that as motivation to not ever do that shit again to people, not force his way back into your life to assuage his conscience. Your healing is more important than his.", "NTA I\u2019m sorry you went through that. Is anyone in your family still in contact with him?

Him telling you to 'grow from it' instead of forgiveness shows he hasn't matured one bit. Get a restraining order now", "NTA.

Telling you that you need to forgive him isn't the same as asking forgiveness.  He doesn't get to tell you how you're allowed to feel about what he did.

Hin telling you to get over it ans grow from it shows that he hasn't even remotely changed.

Your father was obviously a crappy dad and I'm really sorry about what you've been through, but in this case he tried to do right by you.\n\nYou're not an AH for your what you said to him, as given the history it's understandable.

He says he's changed but can't prove it", "NTA. \n\nHe seems to want things to be right without having done anything to make it right. It doesn't sound like he ever even apologized for any of the wrongs he did you, but wants you to forgive him for them all. That's not to say he would deserve your forgiveness in that case. Or if he got your forgiveness, he still wouldn't deserve your time and attention. This is exactly why a real apology is difficult: you have to put yourself out there while accepting the fact that you may not be forgiven. Like that old song says, \"you can't always get what you want.\"\n\nThink about it this way: if the main reason you feel bad about this is because of the day, then you're OK. If you wouldn't be felling bad about this if it had happened on September 25, then nothing you said or did was worth feeling bad about. \n\nI'm glad you have family who do care for you and spend time with you.

Social expectations or norms are useful, but when you have strong emotion, like you did with your dad, it\u2019s more useful to think about what you need, that what you have to do, so you\u2019re good in my book. \nLet\u2019s hope that what he said is the truth and he is a better person that he was back than, but that\u2019s don\u2019t equal to you need to forgive him. \nMerry Christmas to you and your beautiful and supportive family", ">NAH\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrjwaqZfjIY", "I'm trying to teach my kids that apologizing and asking for forgiveness doesn't automatically get it.

All he did was say \"hey, I'm not a piece of garbage now, so you need to forgive me and let bygones be bygones\". Sorry, it doesn't work that way.
