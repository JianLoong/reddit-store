Anyway yes, therapy would be the best for him.", "Well, chocolate would be probably healthier for him than smoking vapors of propylene-glycol... But at least he has something that works. Just beware, I had mild panic attacks as a teen too. When I was 19, before the exams at the end of the school I was attending someone offered me a cigarette to calm down and my brain connected the cigarette with calming down, I became a smoker for 9 years. I started smoking when I argued with someone. Then when just someone made fun of me. Then just every morning with a coffee. And before I realized, I couldn't go a single day without a cigarette, I was nervous and snappy.", "How so? They have to go to therapy to work on their issues and are getting drug tested weekly. These are consequences.", "Weed or derivatives are not legal for minors. And he's not medicated by a professional. He's using vaping which is a health issue.

Therapy should never be associated with punishment because it is something that is being done to help you. Being grounded or taking away your electronics. Consequence.

It\u2019s not like the kid commit a major crime, he\u2019s a teenager that just needed some redirection. I\u2019m sure having bottled up his anxiety for so long was punishment enough. \n\nI mean, think of it this way: if an adult was vaping and decided to open up to a friend or family member about the fact that they were doing it to calm their anxiety, does that mean THEIR devices need to be taken away? No, that doesn\u2019t happen\u2014the adult would receive empathy and have therapy suggested. Why should a teenager be treated any more harshly?", "Consequences do not need to be punishments.

If you feel schooled, that is on you. This is how nicotine works and that is a fact. Immediate calming and relaxation effect, long-term craving, and anxiety booster. And people that self-medicate do so for the immediate effect. Those are all facts. So I'm glad you learned something I guess.", "I don\u2019t mean to play oppression olympics\u2014I really hate doing this. But I\u2019ve also lived 26 years with GAD, panic disorder, depression, autism, and ADHD, and I can absolutely promise you that my vices NEVER stopped (in my case, an eating disorder and a later stint with alcohol) with punishment\u2014in every single instance that I was punished, I only fell deeper into that vice. Because, unfortunately, punishment only pushed me deeper into the pain that I was trying so hard to escape. \n\nThe only thing that brought me out of it was when my spouse (then friend) went against the grain of my parent\u2019s discipline and told me that what I needed was therapy, made the call for me, and told me he\u2019d support me through it no matter what. THAT was when I finally got better. Not when my parents grounded me, or took my phone away, or yelled their disappointment at me. When a friend saw me struggling with food and alcohol and instead of judging me for it, gave me the love and support I needed to get help. \n\nI\u2019m not supporting this kid\u2019s vaping. But, look\u2014he got in trouble at school, and he\u2019s getting a weekly drug test. Those seem like consequences to me. But adding more punishment to a literal child who\u2019s already in a vulnerable place? That\u2019s how crutches perpetuate into addictions.", "The suspension was a negative consequence. Also, you don't think this will be talked about in therapy?", "Thank you for asking a reasonable question. My answer and position on this subject is tied to experience and the practicalities of life as a high functioning sufferer of Panic Disorder. \n\nFirst and foremost: This young man should receive understanding and treatment. He is living in a private hell which only someone who lives with this condition can understand. Imagine your brain convincing you periodically that you are literally dying - all the fear, adrenaline, thoughts struggling to find a way out while you gasp for air and your heart pounds. Not fun.  He is receiving therapy. \n\nSecondly, while living with this illness sufferers also have to live in a world in which their pain is invisible, dismissed, and rarely understood by anyone. They must do this and still manage to support themselves, significant others, and families. Usually this means employment. Usually that means not making excuses related to their illness. Going to work. Going to school. Paying bills year in and year out. And we live in a world where you don\u2019t get points for excuses or good intentions. For this reason, he must learn to function in situations which stress him. For this reason, he must learn to manage his behavior in spite of his illness and episodes. He must learn that if he violates rules at school, in the workplace, in public spaces - there will be consequences, and failure is the greatest teacher. Failure should suck. Failure needs to be uncomfortable. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this light approach to parenting time and time again. Prisons and graveyards are littered with young men whose parents tried to be understanding and delegated consequences to psychiatrists alone\u2026", "I\u2019m not advocating for punishment without treatment. That doesn\u2019t work, as you know.\n\nThis young person need therapy, treatment and consequences. Therapy to understand what is happening to him - I did not even know what the hell was wrong with me when I had my first panic attack - didn\u2019t know for years. Treatment to help alleviate his symptoms while he shores up strategies to deal with this - breathing techniques, sleep hygiene, avoiding nicotine, caffeine and alcohol. And finally - for the sting: Consequences. Nothing teaches us like falling on our faces and being unhappy. Those memories brand our memories. When he screws up at school, there need to be consequences - not simply a vacation at home looking at reels and porn on his iPad. \n\nThank you for sharing with me. I always enjoy reminders that I am not alone in this.", "Yta", "Never", "NTA. Op you sound like a great dad, and I want to say that vaping can help with anxiety short term, but lead to long term anxiety. THC can also increase anxiety (CBD is the calming element).\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid of getting your son on medication for anxiety. Likely an SSRI, which isn\u2019t a controlled substance like Ritalin/Adderall. I have been on Lexapro (it has a cheaper but equal generic version) since I was 15 and it really helps. I stopped having as many intrusive thoughts and anxiety stomach aches.", "Although weekly drug testing may not work because cannabis can persist in the system for up to several months.", "I don't understand the whole trend on Reddit about kids and teenagers not being punished for anything as long as they talk about their feelings. I think it's great they talked about his feelings. I think it's great that they found out what was going down and they're arranging help for him. But you know it's not great? He's going through a rough time so he did something at school with the cotton suspended for 3 days. That still deserves punishment. And I honestly don't think it's the end of the world to go 72 hours without talking to your friends on electronic devices? Unless of course your teenager is so tied up if you absolute communication with every friend he has the electronic device that will have a mental breakdown if he can't text someone back or like a tick tock or whatever the hell it is people do now on discord. It's 72 hours? God damn. How super sensitive is everyone nowadays where someone can't be grounded by not being allowed his telephone LMAO", "Yeah, he\u2019s getting played by his kid.", "Because the suspension is already the punishment. Punishing past the point of showing remorse doesn't do anything.", "Punishment for the sake of making someone miserable is not productive.\n\nThis kid is going through a tough time and acted out. His parent talked to him, got at the root cause of what's going on, and made a plan to make it better.\n\nRemoving the devices would accomplish nothing to solve this kid's problems. It's just an adult on a power trip, not a natural consequence of his actions.", "At my kids\u2019 school, students keep seizing in class after vaping god-knows-what in the bathrooms. Ambulances at the school on a weekly basis due to the THC/nicotine/mystery ingredient mixes. One girl tested positive for fentanyl a few weeks back.\n\nI\u2019d be less worried if I thought they were just smoking cigarettes or weed.", "I grew up during the time they really blew up, feeling the pressure & seeing my old peers going to our local shops to buy them. That was like 5-7 years ago. It\u2019s become pretty bad tbh", "A friend of mine found a fake marijuana vape in her 15-year-old son's bedroom.  She went in there to look for something she couldn't find and didn't plan on snooping.  Apparently, her son's girlfriend gave it to him.  She was also 15. My friend doesn't know how the girlfriend got it."]}
