She has already asked me money a couple of times for her prenatal and vitamins. At first, I caved in and gave her a few times. But what really made things worse was she stopped working. And her and her partner doesn\u2019t have any plans to find work anytime soon and she\u2019s due between next week and December. \n\nTonight she asked me for $50 to get a 3D ultrasound since as per her \u201cit\u2019s going to be a one time thing\u201d. But she added that she doesn\u2019t have money yet and she\u2019s due anytime soon so she can\u2019t have the 3D ultrasound for keepsake purposes. Talk about priorities?? I put my foot down and told her no and that I wont help her at all. Even when the time comes that she\u2019s going to give birth. \n\nShe aired out her frustrations on Facebook and tagged me saying something along the lines that I am greedy, selfish, and a hypocrite.

It's easy for them to talk. Where do they fit into all this? If they're so against you putting your foot down, I'm sure they'd love to support your lazy sister", "NTA - what exactly was her plan? Having a baby with your financial aid?", "NTA. She is an adult and made an adult decision to become pregnant, so she and her partner need to step up and be responsible by getting a job.

That's a luxury/want, not a necessity.\n\nIf she's asks for money in future, I'd ask what for. If its for formula, nappies etc, I would either buy them and give them to her or put the amount on a gift card, and only if its related to the baby.No handing over/sending cash ever. She wanted this baby. She and her bf need to provide for it, not you.", "NTA.\n\nAsking for money for prenatal vitamins is one thing, asking for it for a keepsake is another.  \n\nHer and her boyfriend need to figure out their own shit and not rely on you.", "I kind of feel like everyone sucks here. It\u2019s not cool for her to be constantly asking you for money, and you\u2019re right that the generally responsible thing to do as an upcoming parent is to prepare and try to be financially ready for said child.\n\nBut OP has some anger at her sister\u2019s situation that doesn\u2019t really seem constructive/about the sister asking for money. You\u2019re pissed that she\u2019s always wanted a baby? Because she\u2019s not financially stable?

I\u2019ve told her so many times ti be careful not to get pregnant cause it\u2019s not easy. \n\nAnd definitely going to be the AH for this but I don\u2019t have any plans of babysitting.

They should have been more careful knowing their situation. How is she supposed to raise her kid if she\u2019s not financially stable and not even trying to find other means for them to get by?

You can continue to be a supportive person (not a bank!) or walk away. Given your anger towards her, I think it's best if you walk away tbh. \n\nYou would 100% not be an AH for not babysitting; that's something you only do if you want to. It's not something anyone should expect or take for granted.", "Then, I would say NTA. Having a child is a very big commitment, and unless you've been coerced into it, there's no reason why one shouldn't have to take responsibility for having a child when you know you cannot provide for it. Perhaps her plan was to rely on you for things and deputise you as her parent, and now it's not working out like she hoped? I don't think you're obligated to shed your own money and time for someone when they didn't think through their own financial plans, especially when they throw the things you've done already back in your face by bad-mouthing you to people.
