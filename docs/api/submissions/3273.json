I understand your sister not working, since working much past the 34th week can be dangerous to both mom and baby (although I know people who have done it) , but he could at least be contributing somehow. That's not to say shouldn't work within a couple months after the baby gets here, either, don't get me wrong, but the father needs to be contributing, not expecting his baby mama's family to bear the financial burden. You have your own children to care for, she's going to have to figure it out sometime, better now than later.", "NTA... this was a planned pregnancy... let's see how her plan goes", "NTA she is not your responsibility and never will be. I will never understand the entitlement of people like that! She chose to have a baby no when she can\u2019t even afford the baby and then went and quit her job! If anything you should point out on a social media post everything you did yourself when you had your child because you wanted to support your child and that you didn\u2019t harass people for handled and try to make them look bad online when they didn\u2019t give you everything you wanted.", "She needs to work as well as her bf. Can\u2019t afford a baby don\u2019t have one. She has 9 months to prepare and you aren\u2019t obligated to help. SHE and her bf are responsible for finances!! NTA", "NTA, you are not responsible for her kid or her, her partner needs a job", "People's audacity will never stop amazing me. You're never responsible for other people's choices. Simple as that. If someone calls you an asshole, then you can tell them that if they are so concerned your sister will definitely gladly accept their help. NTA", "Doesn\u2019t sound like anyone who can effect your life if just crack on with your own life and let her lay in the bed she made x", "\u201cYou know. I have been really struggling with this because I can\u2019t afford it. I am so glad you have volunteered the money as it will be a blessing for the family.\u201d Every time just *misunderstand* that their criticism is them paying it. Then let them say no. I would be sure to copy your response to your sister.", "Happy cake day", "Thank you!", "NTA \n\nHer and her baby aren\u2019t your responsibility and you yourself have a child to take care of. She better ask her Facebook friends to help her out since they got so much to say. Block her and keep it moving.", "NTA your sister and her boyfriend sounds like coasters\u2026if u let her get away with it you\u2019ll constantly be paying. Keep your foot down", "NTA.\n\nComing from a third world country also, it's stupid and irresponsible to deliberately have a kid without a stable job (both parents) and expecting relatives to financially help out.", "NTA. It sounds like your sister has some growing up to do.", "She wants the 3D ultrasound for keepsake purposes. She's about to have an 3D baby! Why the hell does she need a photo?\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I would block her and any of the folks agreeing with her. You are not wrong for setting boundaries and she needs to grow up.", "NTA. while there is value in family helping family in raising a child- it seems like your sister is not prepared to do the brunt of the labor just yet. \n\nIt\u2019s possible your sister might be trying to mirror your life in a way to find the same success you had. \n\nI\u2019d say try to approach this situation with compassion, your sister likely did this from a place of misplaced anger and possibly fear - she\u2019s due for a baby soon, sounds terrifying! \n\nWhile you set clear boundaries this might have also triggered something inside her that made her lash out like that.\n\nGood luck and I hope it works out well ~", "NTA. In your situation you have little enough in the first place. You are thoughtful, planning for the long-term for yourself your child. Money that you are able to save goes for your or your child's long-term benefit.\n\nIf you share the little you have with your thoughtless half-sister, it undercuts your ability to plan for a better future. So we arrive at a situation where neither you nor your half-sister, or your children, have any support.\n\nHalf-sister and boyfriend continue in their thoughtless lives and don't ever try to work toward a better future. You would be T A if you let them pick your pockets for frivolities like the ultrasound. You can bet that if they ever somehow gamble and win, they will squander their winnings and never give you and your child a thought.", "YTA", "I always tell my kids, never feel bad for being kind to someone. What they do with that kindness is on them. It only shows their character. Don't let them stop you from being kind. Just recognize that they don't deserve any more and move on.\n\nAlso, NTA", "If this gets worse consider stopping communication with her", "NTA She decided to purposely get pregnant and has no way to support herself, the father or the baby. Unless your country has a generous program that gives support to those who are poor I don't know how she plans to survive. Does she think you have enough money and expect you to support her family? Is she and her BF and child going to be homeless? Hungry? If she is going to bring her child into a miserable situation it might be worth speaking to her about adoption. \n\nI agree with you about working. I am from a first world country and I worked until a week before delivery and went back to work as soon as my paid leave was over. I had to work two jobs for awhile to keep afford housing, food, and other bills. Thankfully I had family willing to babysit. The baby to be has two parents who should be working their butts off to prepare for the babies arrival. It isn't your responsibility. Your sister sounds spoiled, sitting at home waiting for people to hand her money.", "She probably expects you to be an unpaid babysitter. You are better off going NC.", "NTA. This isn\u2019t going to end. She can\u2019t afford the child before it\u2019s even here and she really won\u2019t when it\u2019s born. Put up firm boundaries or be prepared to pay child support for someone\u2019s else\u2019s baby.", "NTA.  This fleecing off you will never end unless you stop it.\nFB is an ass. Sorry you are being shamed. Next bad comment, ask how much that person is donating to a family where no one earns.\nShe does NOT need a fancy scan. The baby needs security (food and shelter )and love.", "Definitely advise responding to these family members that you\u2019re thrilled that your sister has people like them that are able and willing to help her out since you\u2019re not able to. You don\u2019t owe her anything. Her poor choices are not your burden to bear. NTA.", "Just set up a go fund me\n\n\"Pregnant, won't work,  sister is to selfish raising her own children to support me. Please help\"\n\nAnd send the link to anyone criticising you."]}
