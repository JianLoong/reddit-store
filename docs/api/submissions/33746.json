I (20f) go to college and am in my final year before I graduate in the spring. For christmas, I asked my mother and father for a new laptop for christmas since my current one is complete trash. It will not stay on for more than an hour if it isn\u2019t plugged in and when it is, its fan runs so loud people across the library can hear the whirring. My sister (18f) knew i had asked for one and was approving of the idea.\n\nEarlier in the year back in october i had informed my parents of the fact that my laptop was not working properly and had asked if they could help me out in purchasing a new one for myself. I initially offered to pay half. We discussed possible scenarios and ended the conversation with my mom saying, \u201cwell christmas is coming up.\u201d This was followed by my parents asking me to send them the laptops I had been looking at.\n\nFast forward to earlier in december, my mom informed me that since there was not a lot of time to do proper research, that maybe they would give me the laptop at my graduation. I wasn\u2019t crazy about the idea since I would essentially not need it cause school would be over for me, but told her it was up to them. She included that my sister would also get a laptop since she\u2019d be needing one for college. I agree with this and think she deserves one, but she also is going to europe this year. I am so happy for her, but I can\u2019t help but be a bit jealous because I was never really allowed to do anything like this. We are by no means a low income family, but I knew that big trips like that would be turned down.

I saw this coming, but it did sting a bit to know that i would not have a new laptop to return to school with, but also that my sister would be able to get a laptop and an extravagant gift later in 2024. I did vent to her a bit about the laptop because she had gone to bat for me about receiving it sooner and I was lead to think that I would be getting this gift on christmas because my dad was sending me listings for laptops and asking what i thought of them. My little sister is mad at me now because she feels like i\u2019m blaming her for not receiving gifts that are expensive like she does, stating that her trip is a once in a lifetime experience.

You can just get yours fixed. Sounds like you only need a new battery and have the thermal paste replaced. Seems like your sister is the favourite so I understand being a sour about the laptop and overseas trip."]}
