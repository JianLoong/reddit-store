In these 18 years did your parents really not look after you enough for you to help them out in a very obvious time of need.\n\nAgain parents have a responsibility and finacially responsible for you blah blah and you are young still so your reaction is 'ok' but $1800 is but a drop in the pond for what they have spent on raising you.\n\nIf you choose to not help your parents in their time of need and think 1 year staying at home helping out is putting your life on hold i can only say good luck to future relationships", "YTA imo\nit\u2019s only one year and they are your parents\n\nYour mom even helped you get that job\n\nIMO it is a small sacrifice for your parents", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
