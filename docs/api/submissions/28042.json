They (hopefully) love you, despite the abuse/manipulation. They raised you. All that is true. But if you don\u2019t learn to financially put yourself first your life will never be truly your own. Your family will always need money, and they will always take it from you if they can, and clearly they\u2019ll use abusive tactics to get it.\n\nYou have to decide what you want out of your life and act accordingly.
