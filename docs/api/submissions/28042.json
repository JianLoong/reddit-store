My Dad Wants me to put my life on hold, Because he can\u2019t pay bills.", "selftext": "For some context, I am a 18yo M living with my parents. My Mom recently helped me get a high paying job somewhere, which is way better than the fast food job I had not too long ago, which I am very grateful for. Recently my parents have had financial issues, which I have willingly paid for, such as the AC going out, washing machine breaking, car problems, and many more. In total the cost reached over $1800, which I was told I would be paid back for, but recently my dad told me i\u2019m not getting any of it back. Even though I was salty asf about it, I decided to let it go. Yesterday my parents received a letter in the mail stating they were kicked off housing for reasons I can\u2019t say. Before they had received that information, I was planning on moving out march of 2024, but now my dad is telling me that if I don\u2019t stay an extra year to help pay bills, \u201ci\u2019m not loyal to the family and I might as well leave soon.\u201d I told him i\u2019d stay longer to help, but i can\u2019t promise that i\u2019d stay a year, and he\u2019s still trying to tell me I don\u2019t care about the family because of my decision. I understand the severity of their situation, but i can\u2019t guarantee that i\u2019ll put my life on hold for a year, because he can\u2019t pay the bills. AITA?\n\nUpdate:\nHey everyone, i\u2019ve read many of y\u2019all\u2019s comments, and tbh i\u2019m still reading. I really appreciate your feedback, But a lot of y\u2019all are asking for more information, so here it is. I live with both my parents and 5 siblings. None of my parents or siblings have jobs(most of them too young), and that\u2019s by choice. My dad is a retired vet, so he gets military benefits, but he could still work if he wanted to, but he chooses not to. My mom hasn\u2019t had a job since the 90\u2019s, and from what i\u2019ve heard, that\u2019s because my dad told her she couldn\u2019t. For the past 2 years, i\u2019ve been helping around the house with the money i\u2019ve made from the fast food job I had, so besides my dads benefits, that was our only source of income. The money I didn\u2019t get back was supposed to go towards buying my first car, but because they didn\u2019t have any money, that\u2019s where my savings went. They were kick off housing, due to someone reporting them for fraud, and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re here now. I don\u2019t want y\u2019all thinking i\u2019m some entitled kid, that expects everything to be giving to me without paying it back, but i\u2019ve been helping for awhile now and i\u2019m ready to move out. I don\u2019t like the fact that he\u2019s telling me if i don\u2019t stay I don\u2019t care about them, which is a obvious lie, Because I offered to send them money while i\u2019m gone but he told me \u201cthat\u2019s not realistic.\u201d I hope I answered some of y\u2019all\u2019s questions, and again thankyou for your feedback.", "created_utc": 1696213380, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16xkk8k/aita_my_dad_wants_me_to_put_my_life_on_hold/", "score": 450, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Coming from a similar place I empathize with the difficulty of the situation. \n\nOn one hand, this is your family and you may feel like you owe them for all they've done. It sounds like your dad is already trying to guilt you into this narrative, regardless of how true it may be.\n\nOn the other hand, they made the choice to have you and raise you and it sounds like life hasn't been all sunshine and rainbows. You have your own life to live. As a fresh 18 year old, you won't ruin your life by delaying freedom another year by helping your parents. Unless there is some reason things will be different in a year, there is no reason to believe otherwise.

Let's set aside the blatant sexism for a second. In the days where women either couldn't work or weren't allowed to, then it would have been the sole responsibility of the man to be the primary breadwinner. Since your dad's military benefits aren't cutting the mustard, he is not adequately providing for the family. It's like he wants the privileges of being the man-of-the-house but without the responsibility. What a joke. \n\nSo, your mother can work, or your father can work, even if it's only part time for either of them. \n\nAlso if your parents borrowed the money from you under the pretense that they would eventually pay you back, and then basically said \"haha nope!\" after the fact?

There were threats that she would call the police and turn me in for theft of I took my car or personal belongings etc.\n\nMy advice- slowly build up funds they know nothing about and disappear. Grey rock them the rest of the time. Do not challenge them on anything. Be silent and dutiful- when they ask for money act dumb and tell them it's gone.(cause it is, into your secret savings.)\n\nDo not give them your paystubs and if they know where you bank- change banks.\nGet a PO Box for all your mail to be delivered there.\n\nGood luck", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like you are a caring and responsible young adult, and you can have a bright future but you have to get out of there, quickly, and don't look back.  \n\nYou dad is a loser freeloader, and is trying to guilt you into taking care of him not for just a year, but FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE.  He wants you in his house, under his control, always. He's got to get off his ass and get a job.  Sounds like your mom had her hands full with five minor children so expecting her to work isn't reasonable.\n\nI feel for you and your siblings and to your mom, too, but she made her decisions and its in her power to change her life, just as it is in yours. Take control, now.\n\nThe only hope for your dad and mom is for them to hit rock bottom and lift themselves up without expecting anyone else to do it for them.

Your parents are adults and are responsible for themselves. However, I would encourage you to figure out what you are willing to do based on your own values and ethics. My concern is that if they have to move and get a place without assistance, will they be depending on your contribution to get a place and continue to pay for it? If they sign a lease for a year, and you move out in the spring, will they be able to pay rent? But, what will change in a year? Will they be able to pay rent on their own then?\n\nYour dad is trying to manipulate you, don't make a decision based on what he is doing or saying, make a decision based on what you can live with. If lying to them about when you are going to leave is going to make them homeless in March, find another way. Lying now only kicks the drama down the road, and gives your dad more tools with which to guilt you into staying. \n\nCome up with a plan and stick to it. Don't share all of it with your dad, but let him know how much you are willing to help, and for how long.

Would definitely help in making a clear decision.", "It's the same here in US.\n\nAlso immediately thought of this.", "I think OP meant his parents were being kicked off housing assistance, not being kicked out of where they lived.  \nWhich puts a very different spin on what's happening, if they were being kicked out, it could simply be that the lease was ending and they were being given notice that either it would not be renewed or that the rent was going up (to a point the parents could not/would not afford)  \nBeing kick off housing assistance usually means either the parents' income has gone up enough that they no longer qualify, or they were caught violating the rules,  badly enough to be dropped right away, or enough times that after they ignored the warnings they are being dropped.", "Go to college is dumb advice.", "NTA!
