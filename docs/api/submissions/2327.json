It made my boyfriend uncomfortable when he saw me working", "selftext": "So I'm a big car geek, an engineer in the auto industry, and I'm really good at haggling.\n\nI've always seen my female friends who aren't car geeks have people try to rip them off at dealerships. So I started offering to come along to help. And after word got around, loads more people started asking for help.\n\nI decided to start a \"hardass for hire\" business, where I haggle for you at the car dealership, and any savings off the list price I get you, I get 1/3 of that.\n\nThrough all this, I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend Jake. He's never had much to say about my side business, I think he just saw it as something little I did on weekends. \n\nBut this month, he was looking to buy a car, and asked me for help. \n\nI did a little groundwork and made sure he got a bank loan in advance, and emailed the dealership asking for a complete fee breakdown. \n\nBut at the dealership, it was awkward. During the test drive we stopped off to do an inspection, and the salesman was trying to rush us. I wasn't letting him, till my boyfriend took his side. \n\nSo we went back and I went down the inspection checklist item by item to negotiate on each. My boyfriend started being like \"That doesn't bother me\" so I ended up haggling on less than I would of.\n\nWhen we went to close out. I said that we'd be going with a bank loan and not their financing, as their rates were higher, and the dealer got pissed off and said his price was assuming financing. It took a kinda heated exchange where I said I'd walk, for him to honor his price. \n\nBut when the finance guy came in, he had obviously tacked on more fees to compensate. I took a picture of the fine print that had doubled the fees from what I was quoted by email. I had to threaten to walk again, and post the photo, for him to honor their quote.\n\nAll in all, I saved my boyfriend 6 grand. When we got home, I was complaining that that was it; and he was like \"What do you mean that was it? you went too far, that was uncomfortable to sit through.\" \n\nHe asked if I was always like that, and I said not always, I'll be polite if they're being fair, but I stop if I'm getting rushed or scammed.\n\nHe asked how much I was making. if I'd charged him, it would of been 2 grand. I said it was honestly usually more, after I've gotten into the cash-buyer luxury car market, and I've been making 4 to 8 grand a month. \n\nHe was shocked to hear that, because he'd just thought it was a little side hustle, but it was a whole second salary. He said it was kinda fucked up that I was profiting so much off cutting into other people's pay. \n\nI said the margins wouldn't be that big if the dealerships didn't hyperinflate prices when they saw what is usually a lady and her cutesy little female \"friend\" walking in. \n\nHe told me I can't just make everything about sexism, which kinda hurt because I don't? \n\nAITA for my \"hardass for hire\" business?", "created_utc": 1668457280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvbevb/aita_for_having_a_hardass_for_hire_business_it/", "score": 1638, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have Tons of markups!", "LOL NTA \n\nYour boyfriend is hurt because you destroyed his preconceived notions of manliness.", "NTA - you sound amazing.  Car dealerships can be good and can be bad.  It is up to the buyer to be smart.  Hiring you is incredibly smart.  He should have let you do your thing and been proud.", "NTA, this is the best side hustle I\u2019ve ever heard of! Your BF should be thanking you profusely.\n\nWe\u2019ve used car brokers for two of our cars and it\u2019s been good. Their fee is always smaller than the savings.", "I work in automotive and I can only applaud so loudly into the internet void.\n\nYou are doing exactly what a man would do.  Your boyfriend is going through life with blinders on if he thinks this ISN'T  about sexism.  It 100% is.\n\nNTA", "NTA but boy, somebody sure feels emasculated. He isn't use to seeing this side of you and he's obviously got some feelings about it. Give him time to cool down and process and then try to have a conversation about it again. If he can't get over the fact that you're a hard ass you'll have to have a more serious conversation.", "NTA.  \n\nCar dealerships allow plenty of margin for markup and haggling, and you've documented how they did so when your boyfriend went to buy his car.  (Can't claim sexism in that instance.)  You haggle, a deal is struck, everyone's happy.\n\nYour boyfriend's discomfort is *your boyfriend's* discomfort.  He had the option to walk away and stare out the window while you haggled, and not take part, if he was uncomfortable.  Otherwise, why bring you along?", "NTA dealerships are scams. You\u2019re doing \u201cthe lords work\u201d as my grams would say.", "NTA\n\nIt is very easy to get scammed at dealerships whether you're a man or a woman and it's better to go with someone who knows what a fair deal is. I think what you're doing should be a profession of it's own if it isn't already. Too many companies try to scam people out of a lot of money nowadays.", "NTA. I don't know you but I am so proud of you. You keep on being the Hard Ass For Hire. \nFunny, your bf was ok with your little side job until he found out that you are smart, savvy, ballsy and bringing in the $$$.", ">you went too far, that was uncomfortable to sit through.\n\nWhich is exactly what sales people are counting on; they hold the line and you give. j\n\nYour boyfriend should be proud of this very valuable skill you've honed, saving him 6 grand... would he be more \"comfortable\" with another full year of car payments?\n\nHe owes you an apology and a HUGE thank you (preferably with roses). \n\nNTA", "Nta\n\n> He said it was kinda fucked up that I was profiting so much off cutting into other people's pay. \n\n\"If they don't like the deal they can say no. You realize that, right?\"", "NTA, they were trying to rip him off and he views it as cutting into their pay?", "NTA. You\u2019re not making it about sexism, the car industry (sales, repairs, everything) IS sexist! Plus, if a guy that wasn\u2019t comfortable negotiating asked for your services, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d oblige? I mean, why did your boyfriend ask for your help? Is it because regardless of your gender, it\u2019s common sense to take somebody more knowledgeable than you along when making expensive financial commitments? \n\nHe has blatant proof of the lengths they went to, to try and rip him off\u2026 even with you there hard-balling. Imagine the amount of people they ARE able to rip off? Does this really sit better with him than saving somebody money they are paying above and beyond what\u2019s fair by exploitative measures?\n\nI\u2019d use your services! The money I\u2019d pay you, comes from money I wouldn\u2019t be able to save myself.

It really sounds like he has some insecurity issues.", "NTA.  I wish you were around when I bought my first car. You just saved him a lot of money. He should say thank you. It absolutely is about sexism since car dealerships usually target women in this way.", "NTA. If dude doesn't want to swim with sharks you shouldn't get in the water, I assume you're clear about the process with your clients ahead of time and they know you're trying to get the best deal cuz the better it is for them the better it is for you.", "Totally NTA\n\nI wish I had friends like you! I'd be more than fine with your commission rate, too. I know when I walk into anything with cars, people see a \"mark\" to take advantage of.\nI think it's pretty broadly known that car sales situations are specifically set up to be high pressure on the buyer and having someone comfortable to match that energy on the side of the buyer is really only just leveling the playing field. Also, doing the homework ahead of time and securing a loan from a better source, chef's kiss!\nIt seems like he was just plain threatened by your knowledge and \"non-femininity\" in action. It sounds like your boyfriend's feelings are coming more from his perception of you being altered through seeing how beyond-competent you are.\nHis dismissing of other people's (again, pretty broadly known) experiences; car sales trying to take advantage of people based on gender... You gotta ask him to sit down and think about this for a second and why he's fine applying his experience universally. We've all been taken to the cleaners, he's just probably not believed he ever has been. This event probably shook that belief, too", "NTA. Your boyfriend is jealous and has allowed himself to feel emasculated. Maybe just let him go if he can't get his crap together. Keep being awesome!", "NTA. I went with a friend who can haggle to a bike shop. He wasn\u2019t embarrassed to go through all kinds of things to cut the price. I could never have done that. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing - I\u2019m super impressed with your skill. Of course it\u2019s worth a cut of the savings.", "NTA can I hire you!! More folks need to be doing this.", "NTA at all. I wish you luck. But I dont think you need any - many people dont like conflict or aggression and if you get a cut of the savings I reckon this is a money-spinner. Good for you!", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is insecure and doesn't know how to deal with it. That's a him problem, and if he makes it a you problem I'd sure you can negotiate a better relationship somewhere.", "NTA. \n\nYour boyfriend is way out of line and obviously doesn\u2019t understand how any of this works. \n\nThey absolutely add fees and bs expenses.", "NTA. I think that is awesome and IMO, your boyfriend picked a weird thing to argue about. The only thing I would care about is that money was saved. If the dealership was losing money they would reject your offer, plain and simple. If they accepted it, it is on them. Additionally, with the way the car market is, vehicles are overinflated in price to begin with.", "NTA. If he is willing to pay more just to not be uncomfortable then that is on him. But there are plenty of other people out there that recognize they wouldn't get as good of a deal so even with your cut they are saving more than they would otherwise. Your time is worth money. And if they are willing to agree to your terms then it's ok. Bf needs to get over it.\n\nAlso, everything isn't about sexism, but in this area it actually is often sexism. Dealerships will over charge anyone they can, regardless of gender. But they are much more likely to push hard on a woman and assume from go that she knows nothing or is a pushover.", "NTA\n\nYou offer a service that you are good at, in an area of business that makes most people uncomfortable. (Including apparently your bf.)\n\nLet it go. Your bf will probably never see you in action again, or at least not for a very long time.", "NTA and go you.", "NTA. It's a good side hustle as many people to get taken to the cleaners over that stuff.\n\nAnd it basically is sexism as many sales people don't think women have the brain power to haggle or handle \"complicated things\" such as car sales (note: complete and utter bullshit especially since it was women who put us on the moon).", "NTA. You sound awesome. You\u2019re matching their energy & refusing to be pushed by high pressure sales tactics. Keep up the good work!", "NTA - that's your service and you do a damn good job by the sounds of it.\n\nYou are a sales rep's worst nightmare, the infamous hired third base coach. \n\nI've only seen a few of you in the 8 years I was in car sales and my commission was pillaged every single time.\n\nSide note, always ask the finance manager if there is an incentived rate available. Finance managers mark up rates 1-2% for reserve which is a big part of the backend gross, they cannot mark up a fixed incentived rates and are paid a flat. They won't bring it up on their own accord because the flats are usually really low in comparison.", "NTA do you work in the Providence RI area? My old Toyota won\u2019t last forever", "NTA.\n\nThough I do think it would be a benefit for your business from now on to discuss, beforehand with the client, what they want you to push on, what they don't, what they would get uncomfortable from, etc. Just like a strategy with them before going into the dealership.", "NAH. I've purchased over 30 vehicles in the last 15 years. (Yes, I have a problem \ud83d\ude02) and I'd definitely pay for your services. \n\nI'm tired of doing it myself at this point -- dealerships thrive on the \"wearing you down\" or relying on you to not be \"rude\". Outside of homes, cars are usually the next biggest purchase someone is making and I'm not saying you need to make it so the dealership is losing money(they're not or they wouldn't continue to be in business) but you don't need to let them take advantage of you.\n\nIt CAN be super uncomfortable so maybe you could have given him a rundown/warning so he was better prepared? But idk you have to be prepared to just up and walk out or they'll emotionally manipulate you. My husband is too nice and is a pleaser so he knows he just needs to let me do it because he'll end up caving without me.", "NTA. Money is money as far as I'm concerned, and you've got a way to A make it and B help out your friends like you say.", "NTA - tell your bf if the car dealership wasn't still making a profit after your haggling, then they wouldn't sell you the car.", "NTA, first I wish prosperity in your op business, there are many women who are exploited or coerced in dealerships outside that you help several people and earn their money honestly, your boyfriend should be proud and look up to you and use you as an example of motivation for success, but if he thinks this is bad, maybe he needs to change boyfriends because this one was a total loss hahaha, by the way you should let him fall for the salesman's lip when he started to go to the dealership side", "Can I hire you?\n\nNTA, obviously. lol", "As a man i can assuredly tell you you destroyed his masculinity and he needed that reality check. Get yours you earned it it\u2019s not your fault he won\u2019t do the work. Also you are a NTA. Fragile ass ego what a maroon he should say thank you, take you out to dinner and buy you something nice with the 6 fucking thousand dollars you saved his lazy ass", "NTA\n\nOf course haggling is uncomfortable. These people are trying to rip you off. \n\nI'm kinda worried about how defensive he got about the sexism thing. It's pretty well known that car dealerships try to take advantage of people and that they will try to capitalize on the assumption that women know less about cars by raising prices. If he states you're making everything about sexism for something like this, I get the feeling he thinks sexism is incredibly rare...\n\nAnd I don't see anything wrong with your business model. The clients make more money in the end than they would without you, so they're still saving money. I'd love to hire someone like you because I know nothing about cars and hate arguing.", "NTA and it sounds like you have outstanding negotiation skills! Negotiation can be so uncomfortable for people who aren't prepared for it (and even those who are). Most people just aren't naturally equipped to engage in this kind of conflict and do just about anything to avoid it - which of course makes them prey for the sharks. \n\nIt sounds like you have a real talent. \n\nWhen it comes to your bf, a different style of negotiation might be in order. Empathy-based goes a long way with some people.\n\nEdit: if you're negotiating as part of a team, it's important that everyone is on the same page. Communication beforehand is critical. It's worth talking with people you negotiate for about it beforehand, including that it will probably be an uncomfortable process for them and that's ok - but they can't undermine you.\n\nI've also DMd you with details of a fantastic resource that you might find helpful.", "NTA.\n\nExcuses for the metaphor here, especially given the gender roles clearly on display in your post...\n\nYour boyfriend wanted the sausage, but he didn't know how it was made. Now that he's seen how it's made, he's feeling squeamish. If he didn't want to see it, he shouldn't have asked you along.\n\nDid he think haggling was a happy friendly thing where everyone just immediately comes to the best price and no one ever confronts anyone or tries anything sneaky?", "NAH at all! I say that as someone who is deeply, horrifically, terribly uncomfortable with haggling.  I recently bought a used car for sticker price, lol, because I won't haggle.  I have also physically walked away from several situations in which a travel buddy was haggling, because I thought it was undignified to try to get someone to take what amounted to a small latte off the price of a trinket in an underdeveloped country.  \n\nYou are doing people like me a great service in what you're offering at a car dealership, since there is no ethical concern in that situation.  I can totally see how your boyfriend might have been uncomfortable; I would have been.  I also wish I could have hired you!", "NTA keep hustling! What you're doing is awesome.", "NTA I would absolutely hire you if I was buying a car", "Absolutely NTA and it just goes to show how inflated prices are for them to be able to cut that much money off a purchase. I'm looking to buy/lease and would love if you came and helped me!\n\nI can see how it might be a bit uncomfortable for your boyfriend, especially if he's never seen you in that kind of situation before, but he should be grateful to have someone who knows what they're doing when it comes to a big purchase like a vehicle. To call you out about making \"everything about sexism\" is more about him feeling uncomfortable (and possibly somewhat emasculated) than it is about this situation.", "NAH does you bf usually avoid conflict? I that would make me uncomfortable but it is what he asked for. Seems like he asked you to do this without knowing what it entails. You did a good job though and he probably feels grateful for the deal but exhausted too.", "You take a 1/3 of the savings off of sticker?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I think he\u2019s just never seen her that way before, and her cut of it is rather high so when you think your partner is making change and they actually make more than a full time job and you were never made aware it\u2019s a bit of a shock.", "I was going to ask if he thought that you were only charging like $100 each time, instead of several thousand. It might be the money that's a shocker, not the negotiation tactics (I can only assume you don't take shit from other scammers, not just car dealers?) \nMaybe if you're comfortable, lay it out for him that it's a thriving business. If hes a macho type that wants to be the \"breadwinner\", it might kick off a conversation about how he needs to deal with that. But otherwise, he should be glad you saved him $6k and you can afford more stuff in life! \n(I know my bf loves when I get a bonus because it means treats for both of us, but he doesn't expect it, just knows I'll buy a full cake because I want it, and will most likely share)", "I bet your boyfriend thought you got discounts by smiling and flirting with the salesmen...", "I do a similar thing in my job, I always say that my pearls are what get me in the door.", "I wish I had you on my side when I bought my last vehicle....I have to look for someone around here if they can help for the next one!", "NTA. I need a hard ass, since my last car's cost me double what I paid for it in repairs.", "I'm 5'8\", butch as hell, and so very nonconfrontational in these situations. can't tell shit about someone from how they look lol", "For 6 grand off a car you could wear a clown costume and a tutu and I'd still call you bestie lol", "Yeah, I think this is it...", ">> *some men\n\nDudes who don\u2019t feel attacked wouldn\u2019t feel the need to \u201call lives matter\u201d respond to what I said but go off my dude.", "> A man who is ignorant will be taken advantage of just as much as a woman in a car dealership\n\nNo, not in my experience.\n\nSexism leads to an assumed knowledge about cars, when dealing with men, and an assumed ignorance about cars, when dealing with women. \n\nIf you don't believe me, get 20 friends together and ask them all to get a quote for a brake inspection and replacement. And see what prices everyone gets told.", ">A man who is ignorant will be taken advantage of just as much as a woman in a car dealership. They might think the woman is easier prey, but that\u2019s because they are assuming she is ignorant.\n\nThey assume she's ignorant because they're sexist. A man usually has to open his mouth and prove that he's ignorant about cars, tech, sports. A woman's ignorance in these matters is usually automatically assumed. Discrimination like this might make us uncomfortable, but refusing to acknowledge it doesn't make it go away. \n\nIt's also interesting that you're arguing in defence of male strangers you have no personal knowledge of, over the testimony of a person (OP) who encounters this discrimination personally. Shows quite clearly what your own biases are, really.", "Except nobody is talking about getting the best price possible, we're talking about how car salesmen are sexist assholes who will upsell the fuck out women because the assholes assume women won't be able to tell, or call them out on it.", "Same! NTA and would hire you in a heartbeat", "This... I had a feeling I was getting scammed at the dealership so I called husband... completely different quote!", "You're absolutely correct! I've purchased several cars in the past 25 years, and **every single time** the salesperson starts talking to my husband, asks him if he wants to test drive it, and ignores my (and my husband's) repeated comments that it's **MY** car. **I'm** paying for it, and **I** have specific wants and a top price.\n\nI've walked out of dealerships where I was looking at brand-new cars because the salesperson refused to talk to me, or ignored my questions. \n\nAnd don't even get me started on trying to even get a salesperson attention at a dealership if I'm by myself! It's as if I'm invisible. What do they think?? That women don't buy cars?", "Geez, how I hate dealing with Car Crappola, as I call it.  Every single time I need something done on my car, the crappola starts (this needs to be done while we do what you asked for \u201cbecause\u2026usually bogus).  I gag at the \u201clittle lady\u201d tone & now that I\u2019m older, it\u2019s the \u201cold senile little lady\u201d\ud83d\ude21\n\nLuckily, Dad decided both brother & I needed to know the basics about cars.  Whenever the crappola starts, I make them show me exactly what is needed (per them), explain why it\u2019s needed & what happens it it isn\u2019t done.  Have also made them show me the undercarriage on occasion, pointing out a few bits I know. \n\nUsually shuts them up when they figure out I know a thing or two but damn tired of playing that game every time.", "It would only be sexist if the car dealership could make more money of men but choose not to because they have a penis. Car dealerships try to hustle and scam every cent they can out of every body. It\u2019s ridiculous to think they would leave money on the table lmao.\n\nYou literally defeat your own argument when you as a woman negotiate and get the best price.", "I\u2019m not arguing in defense of men, I\u2019m arguing that knowledge and a backbone is the most important thing. Which I still whole heartedly believe.\n\nI find all this fascinating and I don\u2019t care about getting some downvotes. I also own a side business like OP, I deliver and pick up cars for my local Dodge Jeep dealership. I go to auctions and even trailer cars to customers. \n\nI negotiate my own fees and usually end up seeing the final customer paperwork. I\u2019m cool with the finance manager and have even had most of the sales force over to my property for a bbq. Salespeople walk over to me at the dealership all the time and high five and say, \u201cJust got this guy for a 10 pounder.\u201d (Meaning they are literally profiting more than 10 grand of that single car deal). \n\nAt the end of the day, the most important factor in a car sales final price isn\u2019t the sex of the buyer, it\u2019s their knowledge and backbone. OP literally proves that by making $4,000 a month negotiating for people.", "No, that was my original comment that you responded too. I know what I was talking about lol. OP\u2019s story is literally a tv episode already from like 15 years ago and I made the observation that the moral of the story is that ignorance is the most important part of a car sales final price. \n\nA woman gets the best deal in both stories and their male partners get embarrassed.", "I'm not really sure how to explain sexism exists to a man who has never experienced it, and is not interested in listening to women's perspectives. \n\nEnjoy your echo chamber, buddy.", "\"Look as a man let me explain to you a women how women are treated in these situations\".  Jesus dude, you're comments are the point.", "Not everyone has the same knowledge of all things. \n\nIt would be sexist of me to try to sell you... Say, makeup, as a gift for a girl... But upcharge you because I assume you don't know better. Because if you actually don't know a lot about makeup, you would have been taken advantage of. \n\nIn cars, some people act sexist and upcharge women. I can see it happen, when I work with men versus women. On average, women get quoted higher prices for cars.\n\nCan you explain why you think women get quoted higher, and hit with hidden fees more frequently?", "\"There was this one episode in this one sitcom a decade ago so therefore sexism doesn't exist\" is quite a fucking take lmao", "I honestly think guys like the one you responded to do not want to get it because it would mean questioning how they interact with women", "I already said they assume that woman are easier prey and they act accordingly. I\u2019m not going to argue over their choice of words because that\u2019s not the point. \n\nThe point is price. They will try to sneak in whatever they think they can get away with. It\u2019s a direct correlation with perceived and real ignorance. If they think a man doesn\u2019t know cars or care about the details, they are going to try to hit \u2018em hard.\n\nIt\u2019s obviously going to become readily apparent if the customer has a spine and educated themselves on the market. I see men get hustled all day long just like OP\u2019s boyfriend was going to be. \n\nIf it was only about sexism than OP couldn\u2019t even do her job and it wouldn\u2019t matter if women know their shit and can negotiate. I am in no way saying OP hasn\u2019t experienced sexism. I\u2019m saying ignorance is a bigger factor in car sale prices", "Because they're both talking past each other. \n\n\nOp is saying that a salesman will try to rip off a woman more because they believe she will be less likely to see it coming and push back.\n\n\nThe commentor is saying that an equally savvy man or woman will get the same deal, thus op is able to run the business despite being a woman.\n\n\nThey're just using different definitions of sexism", "Explain how OP can make her business if women can\u2019t get the same prices as men?", "But if I educated myself on makeup and price shopped Sephora and all major retailers before also spending a week or two on makeup subreddits learning the market then it wouldn\u2019t really matter, I would know the correct price and get it.\n\nJust like you do with cars. It doesn\u2019t matter that you are a woman.", "> If they think a man doesn\u2019t know cars or care about the details, they are going to try to hit \u2018em hard.\n\nSexism teaches men to NOT THINK other men are ignorant about cars.", "Except I already acknowledged and acceded that point in the very beginning. Salespeople might assume women are ignorant and target them more. That won\u2019t matter one freaking bit though if the woman learns the market beforehand and comes in ready to walk out. \n\nMy entire comment is that ignorance is a biggest factor, not the sex of the buyer, and I got my shit jumped by the Reddit hive mind because I\u2019m somehow saying sexism isn\u2019t real. We were never arguing whether sexism is real in the car industry. It was about getting the best final sales price.\n\nThis post is literally a King of the Hill episode where a woman also comes in and get a better price than her husband at the car dealership", "Omg dude the sexism is in the assumption of ignorance! \nThe point is a man and a woman who are equally ignorant of cars will get different quotes because the man is assumed to be knowledgeable about cars and the woman is assumed to be ignorant. Women have to do more work and prove that they know what they are talking about + spend many hours haggling and still get condescended to and talked down to the whole time. Of course between a men who knows nothing and a woman who is knowledgeable, the woman might get a lower price but the point is that at the same level of knowledge men get lower quotes. Also if OP was a men with the same knowledge she might be able to get even better deals, and she would certainly be able to do it faster. I had a gay (male) friend who knew nothing about cars but would pretend to be the boyfriend to his female friends and automstically get them better deals that way, just by showing up.\nI honestly can't tell if you're just stupid or deliberately trying to miss the point", "I genuinely don't understand what you're trying to say here. OP's job is to get dealerships to lower the price as much as possible for both men and women, because they're are always going to be selling above the literal value of the car. You know, to make a profit. But they try to upcharge way more for women because they assume women won't realize or call them out on it. This is not always literally intentional. Some salesmen may be doing this subconsciously. But many do it intentionally as well. OP saves people money by haggling and reading the fine lines in the contracts and such and is paid by the people saving money on a car. This is the luxury car business as OP said, so her earnings are more than they would be if we were talking used cars.", "But you don't have to for most things in your life... You're a dude.", "How are you able to save these people money then? Surely they put their foot down and say no you\u2019re a woman this is your final price, no negotiations", "So then it\u2019s actually like I said and the most important factor is not being ignorant and standing up for yourself. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a woman as OP proves with her business.", "I\u2019m telling you they try to upcharge every body every thing that they possibly can. They sneak the fees into men\u2019s paperwork too I promise. OP can argue that there are more hidden fees hidden better for woman but that brings us full circle back to my original comment.\n\nIgnorance is what they are actually targeting and knowledge + having the backbone to walk away is actually the most important part. If woman learn the market and come prepared to negotiate, they can get just as good of prices as men. Otherwise OP literally couldn\u2019t do her job."]}
