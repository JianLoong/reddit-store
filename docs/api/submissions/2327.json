It made my boyfriend uncomfortable when he saw me working", "selftext": "So I'm a big car geek, an engineer in the auto industry, and I'm really good at haggling.\n\nI've always seen my female friends who aren't car geeks have people try to rip them off at dealerships. So I started offering to come along to help. And after word got around, loads more people started asking for help.\n\nI decided to start a \"hardass for hire\" business, where I haggle for you at the car dealership, and any savings off the list price I get you, I get 1/3 of that.\n\nThrough all this, I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend Jake. He's never had much to say about my side business, I think he just saw it as something little I did on weekends. \n\nBut this month, he was looking to buy a car, and asked me for help. \n\nI did a little groundwork and made sure he got a bank loan in advance, and emailed the dealership asking for a complete fee breakdown. \n\nBut at the dealership, it was awkward. During the test drive we stopped off to do an inspection, and the salesman was trying to rush us. I wasn't letting him, till my boyfriend took his side. \n\nSo we went back and I went down the inspection checklist item by item to negotiate on each. My boyfriend started being like \"That doesn't bother me\" so I ended up haggling on less than I would of.\n\nWhen we went to close out. I said that we'd be going with a bank loan and not their financing, as their rates were higher, and the dealer got pissed off and said his price was assuming financing. It took a kinda heated exchange where I said I'd walk, for him to honor his price. \n\nBut when the finance guy came in, he had obviously tacked on more fees to compensate. I took a picture of the fine print that had doubled the fees from what I was quoted by email. I had to threaten to walk again, and post the photo, for him to honor their quote.\n\nAll in all, I saved my boyfriend 6 grand. When we got home, I was complaining that that was it; and he was like \"What do you mean that was it? you went too far, that was uncomfortable to sit through.\" \n\nHe asked if I was always like that, and I said not always, I'll be polite if they're being fair, but I stop if I'm getting rushed or scammed.\n\nHe asked how much I was making. if I'd charged him, it would of been 2 grand. I said it was honestly usually more, after I've gotten into the cash-buyer luxury car market, and I've been making 4 to 8 grand a month. \n\nHe was shocked to hear that, because he'd just thought it was a little side hustle, but it was a whole second salary. He said it was kinda fucked up that I was profiting so much off cutting into other people's pay. \n\nI said the margins wouldn't be that big if the dealerships didn't hyperinflate prices when they saw what is usually a lady and her cutesy little female \"friend\" walking in. \n\nHe told me I can't just make everything about sexism, which kinda hurt because I don't? \n\nAITA for my \"hardass for hire\" business?", "created_utc": 1668457280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvbevb/aita_for_having_a_hardass_for_hire_business_it/", "score": 3513, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have Tons of markups!", "LOL NTA \n\nYour boyfriend is hurt because you destroyed his preconceived notions of manliness.", "NTA - you sound amazing.  Car dealerships can be good and can be bad.  It is up to the buyer to be smart.  Hiring you is incredibly smart.  He should have let you do your thing and been proud.", "NTA, this is the best side hustle I\u2019ve ever heard of! Your BF should be thanking you profusely.\n\nWe\u2019ve used car brokers for two of our cars and it\u2019s been good. Their fee is always smaller than the savings.", "I work in automotive and I can only applaud so loudly into the internet void.\n\nYou are doing exactly what a man would do.  Your boyfriend is going through life with blinders on if he thinks this ISN'T  about sexism.  It 100% is.\n\nNTA", "NTA but boy, somebody sure feels emasculated. He isn't use to seeing this side of you and he's obviously got some feelings about it. Give him time to cool down and process and then try to have a conversation about it again. If he can't get over the fact that you're a hard ass you'll have to have a more serious conversation.", "NTA.  \n\nCar dealerships allow plenty of margin for markup and haggling, and you've documented how they did so when your boyfriend went to buy his car.  (Can't claim sexism in that instance.)  You haggle, a deal is struck, everyone's happy.\n\nYour boyfriend's discomfort is *your boyfriend's* discomfort.  He had the option to walk away and stare out the window while you haggled, and not take part, if he was uncomfortable.  Otherwise, why bring you along?", "NTA dealerships are scams. You\u2019re doing \u201cthe lords work\u201d as my grams would say.", "NTA\n\nIt is very easy to get scammed at dealerships whether you're a man or a woman and it's better to go with someone who knows what a fair deal is. I think what you're doing should be a profession of it's own if it isn't already. Too many companies try to scam people out of a lot of money nowadays.", "NTA. I don't know you but I am so proud of you. You keep on being the Hard Ass For Hire. \nFunny, your bf was ok with your little side job until he found out that you are smart, savvy, ballsy and bringing in the $$$.", ">you went too far, that was uncomfortable to sit through.\n\nWhich is exactly what sales people are counting on; they hold the line and you give. j\n\nYour boyfriend should be proud of this very valuable skill you've honed, saving him 6 grand... would he be more \"comfortable\" with another full year of car payments?\n\nHe owes you an apology and a HUGE thank you (preferably with roses). \n\nNTA", "Nta\n\n> He said it was kinda fucked up that I was profiting so much off cutting into other people's pay. \n\n\"If they don't like the deal they can say no. You realize that, right?\"", "NTA, they were trying to rip him off and he views it as cutting into their pay?", "NTA. You\u2019re not making it about sexism, the car industry (sales, repairs, everything) IS sexist! Plus, if a guy that wasn\u2019t comfortable negotiating asked for your services, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d oblige? I mean, why did your boyfriend ask for your help? Is it because regardless of your gender, it\u2019s common sense to take somebody more knowledgeable than you along when making expensive financial commitments? \n\nHe has blatant proof of the lengths they went to, to try and rip him off\u2026 even with you there hard-balling. Imagine the amount of people they ARE able to rip off? Does this really sit better with him than saving somebody money they are paying above and beyond what\u2019s fair by exploitative measures?\n\nI\u2019d use your services! The money I\u2019d pay you, comes from money I wouldn\u2019t be able to save myself.

It really sounds like he has some insecurity issues.", "NTA.  I wish you were around when I bought my first car. You just saved him a lot of money. He should say thank you. It absolutely is about sexism since car dealerships usually target women in this way.", "NTA. If dude doesn't want to swim with sharks you shouldn't get in the water, I assume you're clear about the process with your clients ahead of time and they know you're trying to get the best deal cuz the better it is for them the better it is for you.", "Totally NTA\n\nI wish I had friends like you! I'd be more than fine with your commission rate, too. I know when I walk into anything with cars, people see a \"mark\" to take advantage of.\nI think it's pretty broadly known that car sales situations are specifically set up to be high pressure on the buyer and having someone comfortable to match that energy on the side of the buyer is really only just leveling the playing field. Also, doing the homework ahead of time and securing a loan from a better source, chef's kiss!\nIt seems like he was just plain threatened by your knowledge and \"non-femininity\" in action. It sounds like your boyfriend's feelings are coming more from his perception of you being altered through seeing how beyond-competent you are.\nHis dismissing of other people's (again, pretty broadly known) experiences; car sales trying to take advantage of people based on gender... You gotta ask him to sit down and think about this for a second and why he's fine applying his experience universally. We've all been taken to the cleaners, he's just probably not believed he ever has been. This event probably shook that belief, too", "NTA. Your boyfriend is jealous and has allowed himself to feel emasculated. Maybe just let him go if he can't get his crap together. Keep being awesome!", "NTA. I went with a friend who can haggle to a bike shop. He wasn\u2019t embarrassed to go through all kinds of things to cut the price. I could never have done that. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing - I\u2019m super impressed with your skill. Of course it\u2019s worth a cut of the savings.", "NTA can I hire you!! More folks need to be doing this.", "NTA at all. I wish you luck. But I dont think you need any - many people dont like conflict or aggression and if you get a cut of the savings I reckon this is a money-spinner. Good for you!", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is insecure and doesn't know how to deal with it. That's a him problem, and if he makes it a you problem I'd sure you can negotiate a better relationship somewhere.", "NTA. \n\nYour boyfriend is way out of line and obviously doesn\u2019t understand how any of this works. \n\nThey absolutely add fees and bs expenses.", "NTA. I think that is awesome and IMO, your boyfriend picked a weird thing to argue about. The only thing I would care about is that money was saved. If the dealership was losing money they would reject your offer, plain and simple. If they accepted it, it is on them. Additionally, with the way the car market is, vehicles are overinflated in price to begin with.", "NTA. If he is willing to pay more just to not be uncomfortable then that is on him. But there are plenty of other people out there that recognize they wouldn't get as good of a deal so even with your cut they are saving more than they would otherwise. Your time is worth money. And if they are willing to agree to your terms then it's ok. Bf needs to get over it.\n\nAlso, everything isn't about sexism, but in this area it actually is often sexism. Dealerships will over charge anyone they can, regardless of gender. But they are much more likely to push hard on a woman and assume from go that she knows nothing or is a pushover.", "NTA\n\nYou offer a service that you are good at, in an area of business that makes most people uncomfortable. (Including apparently your bf.)\n\nLet it go. Your bf will probably never see you in action again, or at least not for a very long time.", "NTA and go you.", "NTA. It's a good side hustle as many people to get taken to the cleaners over that stuff.\n\nAnd it basically is sexism as many sales people don't think women have the brain power to haggle or handle \"complicated things\" such as car sales (note: complete and utter bullshit especially since it was women who put us on the moon).", "NTA. You sound awesome. You\u2019re matching their energy & refusing to be pushed by high pressure sales tactics. Keep up the good work!", "NTA - that's your service and you do a damn good job by the sounds of it.\n\nYou are a sales rep's worst nightmare, the infamous hired third base coach. \n\nI've only seen a few of you in the 8 years I was in car sales and my commission was pillaged every single time.\n\nSide note, always ask the finance manager if there is an incentived rate available. Finance managers mark up rates 1-2% for reserve which is a big part of the backend gross, they cannot mark up a fixed incentived rates and are paid a flat. They won't bring it up on their own accord because the flats are usually really low in comparison.", "NTA do you work in the Providence RI area? My old Toyota won\u2019t last forever", "NTA.\n\nThough I do think it would be a benefit for your business from now on to discuss, beforehand with the client, what they want you to push on, what they don't, what they would get uncomfortable from, etc. Just like a strategy with them before going into the dealership.", "NAH. I've purchased over 30 vehicles in the last 15 years. (Yes, I have a problem \ud83d\ude02) and I'd definitely pay for your services. \n\nI'm tired of doing it myself at this point -- dealerships thrive on the \"wearing you down\" or relying on you to not be \"rude\". Outside of homes, cars are usually the next biggest purchase someone is making and I'm not saying you need to make it so the dealership is losing money(they're not or they wouldn't continue to be in business) but you don't need to let them take advantage of you.\n\nIt CAN be super uncomfortable so maybe you could have given him a rundown/warning so he was better prepared? But idk you have to be prepared to just up and walk out or they'll emotionally manipulate you. My husband is too nice and is a pleaser so he knows he just needs to let me do it because he'll end up caving without me.", "NTA. Money is money as far as I'm concerned, and you've got a way to A make it and B help out your friends like you say.", "NTA - tell your bf if the car dealership wasn't still making a profit after your haggling, then they wouldn't sell you the car.", "NTA, first I wish prosperity in your op business, there are many women who are exploited or coerced in dealerships outside that you help several people and earn their money honestly, your boyfriend should be proud and look up to you and use you as an example of motivation for success, but if he thinks this is bad, maybe he needs to change boyfriends because this one was a total loss hahaha, by the way you should let him fall for the salesman's lip when he started to go to the dealership side", "Can I hire you?\n\nNTA, obviously. lol", "As a man i can assuredly tell you you destroyed his masculinity and he needed that reality check. Get yours you earned it it\u2019s not your fault he won\u2019t do the work. Also you are a NTA. Fragile ass ego what a maroon he should say thank you, take you out to dinner and buy you something nice with the 6 fucking thousand dollars you saved his lazy ass", "NTA\n\nOf course haggling is uncomfortable. These people are trying to rip you off. \n\nI'm kinda worried about how defensive he got about the sexism thing. It's pretty well known that car dealerships try to take advantage of people and that they will try to capitalize on the assumption that women know less about cars by raising prices. If he states you're making everything about sexism for something like this, I get the feeling he thinks sexism is incredibly rare...\n\nAnd I don't see anything wrong with your business model. The clients make more money in the end than they would without you, so they're still saving money. I'd love to hire someone like you because I know nothing about cars and hate arguing.", "NTA and it sounds like you have outstanding negotiation skills! Negotiation can be so uncomfortable for people who aren't prepared for it (and even those who are). Most people just aren't naturally equipped to engage in this kind of conflict and do just about anything to avoid it - which of course makes them prey for the sharks. \n\nIt sounds like you have a real talent. \n\nWhen it comes to your bf, a different style of negotiation might be in order. Empathy-based goes a long way with some people.\n\nEdit: if you're negotiating as part of a team, it's important that everyone is on the same page. Communication beforehand is critical. It's worth talking with people you negotiate for about it beforehand, including that it will probably be an uncomfortable process for them and that's ok - but they can't undermine you.\n\nI've also DMd you with details of a fantastic resource that you might find helpful.", "NTA.\n\nExcuses for the metaphor here, especially given the gender roles clearly on display in your post...\n\nYour boyfriend wanted the sausage, but he didn't know how it was made. Now that he's seen how it's made, he's feeling squeamish. If he didn't want to see it, he shouldn't have asked you along.\n\nDid he think haggling was a happy friendly thing where everyone just immediately comes to the best price and no one ever confronts anyone or tries anything sneaky?", "NAH at all! I say that as someone who is deeply, horrifically, terribly uncomfortable with haggling.  I recently bought a used car for sticker price, lol, because I won't haggle.  I have also physically walked away from several situations in which a travel buddy was haggling, because I thought it was undignified to try to get someone to take what amounted to a small latte off the price of a trinket in an underdeveloped country.  \n\nYou are doing people like me a great service in what you're offering at a car dealership, since there is no ethical concern in that situation.  I can totally see how your boyfriend might have been uncomfortable; I would have been.  I also wish I could have hired you!", "NTA keep hustling! What you're doing is awesome.", "NTA I would absolutely hire you if I was buying a car", "Absolutely NTA and it just goes to show how inflated prices are for them to be able to cut that much money off a purchase. I'm looking to buy/lease and would love if you came and helped me!\n\nI can see how it might be a bit uncomfortable for your boyfriend, especially if he's never seen you in that kind of situation before, but he should be grateful to have someone who knows what they're doing when it comes to a big purchase like a vehicle. To call you out about making \"everything about sexism\" is more about him feeling uncomfortable (and possibly somewhat emasculated) than it is about this situation.", "NAH does you bf usually avoid conflict? I that would make me uncomfortable but it is what he asked for. Seems like he asked you to do this without knowing what it entails. You did a good job though and he probably feels grateful for the deal but exhausted too.", "You take a 1/3 of the savings off of sticker?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Of course between a men who knows nothing and a woman who is knowledgeable, the woman might get a lower price but the point is that at the same level of knowledge men get lower quotes.

Some salesmen may be doing this subconsciously. But many do it intentionally as well.

That's your bf.", "So the things he was shocked / hurt over, and your recounting he pretty much said it, is you were taking away money from *men*, in a male-dominated field. I mean, those guys do have a rep of being skeevy scam artists - each time I\u2019ve bought a new car, I had friends - always women -  in the industry recommend both which dealerships to go to and which salesmen to work with, the ones who were known to be honest, straight-shooters. \n\n*That*\u2019s what attacked his ego, was a women - who it sounds like he didn\u2019t have a high opinion of your knowledge otter business acumen, TBH - making men back down when caught. \n\n\nAnd maybe flip it around on him: you saved him $6K. I don\u2019t have the numbers on how many cats they sell a month, or how their commission works, but even if all they\u2019re getting on commission is 10% of what they\u2019re overcharging, and they only sell 3 cars a week, that\u2019s like $90K on commissions a year, he shouldn\u2019t be feeling sorry for them.  \n\nNow compare that to people - more often than not women - who get scammed into paying that extra are probably paying another $100/mo on the car loan (assuming normal current national average car loan rates, for a good but not high-end car); that $100 is a lot of people living not a lot above paycheck-to-paycheck. \n\n\nBTW, you are absolutely NTA, you\u2019re standing up for the little guy (or gal, as the case may be) against a well-honed hard sell industry, and you\u2019re taking an absolutely fair commission for your knowledge and hard efforts.", "Your business idea is awesome. Don't let anyone make you doubt that. NTA.", "you've met men, right?", "It sounds like the OPs boyfriend is uncomfortable with haggling at all. It can seem combative and confrontational if you\u2019re not accustomed to it. I learned to haggle from a Ukrainian Babushka and I still have to fight the urge to just let it go because I feel uncomfortable. \n\nI think he also has an inaccurate understanding of the way dealers and sales people at dealers make their money.

I think many of them think that because they aren't sales bros, they're immune from sexist thought.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor your bf it might be a combo of this and just him being conflict-averse.
