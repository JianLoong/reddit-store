It made my boyfriend uncomfortable when he saw me working", "selftext": "So I'm a big car geek, an engineer in the auto industry, and I'm really good at haggling.\n\nI've always seen my female friends who aren't car geeks have people try to rip them off at dealerships. So I started offering to come along to help. And after word got around, loads more people started asking for help.\n\nI decided to start a \"hardass for hire\" business, where I haggle for you at the car dealership, and any savings off the list price I get you, I get 1/3 of that.\n\nThrough all this, I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend Jake. He's never had much to say about my side business, I think he just saw it as something little I did on weekends. \n\nBut this month, he was looking to buy a car, and asked me for help. \n\nI did a little groundwork and made sure he got a bank loan in advance, and emailed the dealership asking for a complete fee breakdown. \n\nBut at the dealership, it was awkward. During the test drive we stopped off to do an inspection, and the salesman was trying to rush us. I wasn't letting him, till my boyfriend took his side. \n\nSo we went back and I went down the inspection checklist item by item to negotiate on each. My boyfriend started being like \"That doesn't bother me\" so I ended up haggling on less than I would of.\n\nWhen we went to close out. I said that we'd be going with a bank loan and not their financing, as their rates were higher, and the dealer got pissed off and said his price was assuming financing. It took a kinda heated exchange where I said I'd walk, for him to honor his price. \n\nBut when the finance guy came in, he had obviously tacked on more fees to compensate. I took a picture of the fine print that had doubled the fees from what I was quoted by email. I had to threaten to walk again, and post the photo, for him to honor their quote.\n\nAll in all, I saved my boyfriend 6 grand. When we got home, I was complaining that that was it; and he was like \"What do you mean that was it? you went too far, that was uncomfortable to sit through.\" \n\nHe asked if I was always like that, and I said not always, I'll be polite if they're being fair, but I stop if I'm getting rushed or scammed.\n\nHe asked how much I was making. if I'd charged him, it would of been 2 grand. I said it was honestly usually more, after I've gotten into the cash-buyer luxury car market, and I've been making 4 to 8 grand a month. \n\nHe was shocked to hear that, because he'd just thought it was a little side hustle, but it was a whole second salary. He said it was kinda fucked up that I was profiting so much off cutting into other people's pay. \n\nI said the margins wouldn't be that big if the dealerships didn't hyperinflate prices when they saw what is usually a lady and her cutesy little female \"friend\" walking in. \n\nHe told me I can't just make everything about sexism, which kinda hurt because I don't? \n\nAITA for my \"hardass for hire\" business?", "created_utc": 1668457280, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvbevb/aita_for_having_a_hardass_for_hire_business_it/", "score": 395, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They have Tons of markups!", "LOL NTA \n\nYour boyfriend is hurt because you destroyed his preconceived notions of manliness.", "NTA - you sound amazing.  Car dealerships can be good and can be bad.  It is up to the buyer to be smart.  Hiring you is incredibly smart.  He should have let you do your thing and been proud.", "NTA, this is the best side hustle I\u2019ve ever heard of! Your BF should be thanking you profusely.\n\nWe\u2019ve used car brokers for two of our cars and it\u2019s been good. Their fee is always smaller than the savings.", "I work in automotive and I can only applaud so loudly into the internet void.\n\nYou are doing exactly what a man would do.  Your boyfriend is going through life with blinders on if he thinks this ISN'T  about sexism.  It 100% is.\n\nNTA", "NTA but boy, somebody sure feels emasculated. He isn't use to seeing this side of you and he's obviously got some feelings about it. Give him time to cool down and process and then try to have a conversation about it again. If he can't get over the fact that you're a hard ass you'll have to have a more serious conversation.", "NTA.  \n\nCar dealerships allow plenty of margin for markup and haggling, and you've documented how they did so when your boyfriend went to buy his car.  (Can't claim sexism in that instance.)  You haggle, a deal is struck, everyone's happy.\n\nYour boyfriend's discomfort is *your boyfriend's* discomfort.  He had the option to walk away and stare out the window while you haggled, and not take part, if he was uncomfortable.  Otherwise, why bring you along?", "NTA dealerships are scams. You\u2019re doing \u201cthe lords work\u201d as my grams would say.", "NTA\n\nIt is very easy to get scammed at dealerships whether you're a man or a woman and it's better to go with someone who knows what a fair deal is. I think what you're doing should be a profession of it's own if it isn't already. Too many companies try to scam people out of a lot of money nowadays.", "NTA. I don't know you but I am so proud of you. You keep on being the Hard Ass For Hire. \nFunny, your bf was ok with your little side job until he found out that you are smart, savvy, ballsy and bringing in the $$$.", ">you went too far, that was uncomfortable to sit through.\n\nWhich is exactly what sales people are counting on; they hold the line and you give. j\n\nYour boyfriend should be proud of this very valuable skill you've honed, saving him 6 grand... would he be more \"comfortable\" with another full year of car payments?\n\nHe owes you an apology and a HUGE thank you (preferably with roses). \n\nNTA", "Nta\n\n> He said it was kinda fucked up that I was profiting so much off cutting into other people's pay. \n\n\"If they don't like the deal they can say no. You realize that, right?\"", "NTA, they were trying to rip him off and he views it as cutting into their pay?", "NTA. You\u2019re not making it about sexism, the car industry (sales, repairs, everything) IS sexist! Plus, if a guy that wasn\u2019t comfortable negotiating asked for your services, I\u2019m sure you\u2019d oblige? I mean, why did your boyfriend ask for your help? Is it because regardless of your gender, it\u2019s common sense to take somebody more knowledgeable than you along when making expensive financial commitments? \n\nHe has blatant proof of the lengths they went to, to try and rip him off\u2026 even with you there hard-balling. Imagine the amount of people they ARE able to rip off? Does this really sit better with him than saving somebody money they are paying above and beyond what\u2019s fair by exploitative measures?\n\nI\u2019d use your services! The money I\u2019d pay you, comes from money I wouldn\u2019t be able to save myself.

It really sounds like he has some insecurity issues.", "NTA.  I wish you were around when I bought my first car. You just saved him a lot of money. He should say thank you. It absolutely is about sexism since car dealerships usually target women in this way.", "NTA. If dude doesn't want to swim with sharks you shouldn't get in the water, I assume you're clear about the process with your clients ahead of time and they know you're trying to get the best deal cuz the better it is for them the better it is for you.", "Totally NTA\n\nI wish I had friends like you! I'd be more than fine with your commission rate, too. I know when I walk into anything with cars, people see a \"mark\" to take advantage of.\nI think it's pretty broadly known that car sales situations are specifically set up to be high pressure on the buyer and having someone comfortable to match that energy on the side of the buyer is really only just leveling the playing field. Also, doing the homework ahead of time and securing a loan from a better source, chef's kiss!\nIt seems like he was just plain threatened by your knowledge and \"non-femininity\" in action. It sounds like your boyfriend's feelings are coming more from his perception of you being altered through seeing how beyond-competent you are.\nHis dismissing of other people's (again, pretty broadly known) experiences; car sales trying to take advantage of people based on gender... You gotta ask him to sit down and think about this for a second and why he's fine applying his experience universally. We've all been taken to the cleaners, he's just probably not believed he ever has been. This event probably shook that belief, too", "NTA. Your boyfriend is jealous and has allowed himself to feel emasculated. Maybe just let him go if he can't get his crap together. Keep being awesome!", "NTA. I went with a friend who can haggle to a bike shop. He wasn\u2019t embarrassed to go through all kinds of things to cut the price. I could never have done that. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing - I\u2019m super impressed with your skill. Of course it\u2019s worth a cut of the savings.", "NTA can I hire you!! More folks need to be doing this.", "NTA at all. I wish you luck. But I dont think you need any - many people dont like conflict or aggression and if you get a cut of the savings I reckon this is a money-spinner. Good for you!", "NTA\n\nYour boyfriend is insecure and doesn't know how to deal with it. That's a him problem, and if he makes it a you problem I'd sure you can negotiate a better relationship somewhere.", "NTA. \n\nYour boyfriend is way out of line and obviously doesn\u2019t understand how any of this works. \n\nThey absolutely add fees and bs expenses.", "NTA. I think that is awesome and IMO, your boyfriend picked a weird thing to argue about. The only thing I would care about is that money was saved. If the dealership was losing money they would reject your offer, plain and simple. If they accepted it, it is on them. Additionally, with the way the car market is, vehicles are overinflated in price to begin with.", "NTA. If he is willing to pay more just to not be uncomfortable then that is on him. But there are plenty of other people out there that recognize they wouldn't get as good of a deal so even with your cut they are saving more than they would otherwise. Your time is worth money. And if they are willing to agree to your terms then it's ok. Bf needs to get over it.\n\nAlso, everything isn't about sexism, but in this area it actually is often sexism. Dealerships will over charge anyone they can, regardless of gender. But they are much more likely to push hard on a woman and assume from go that she knows nothing or is a pushover.", "NTA\n\nYou offer a service that you are good at, in an area of business that makes most people uncomfortable. (Including apparently your bf.)\n\nLet it go. Your bf will probably never see you in action again, or at least not for a very long time.", "NTA and go you.", "NTA. It's a good side hustle as many people to get taken to the cleaners over that stuff.\n\nAnd it basically is sexism as many sales people don't think women have the brain power to haggle or handle \"complicated things\" such as car sales (note: complete and utter bullshit especially since it was women who put us on the moon).", "NTA. You sound awesome. You\u2019re matching their energy & refusing to be pushed by high pressure sales tactics. Keep up the good work!", "NTA - that's your service and you do a damn good job by the sounds of it.\n\nYou are a sales rep's worst nightmare, the infamous hired third base coach. \n\nI've only seen a few of you in the 8 years I was in car sales and my commission was pillaged every single time.\n\nSide note, always ask the finance manager if there is an incentived rate available. Finance managers mark up rates 1-2% for reserve which is a big part of the backend gross, they cannot mark up a fixed incentived rates and are paid a flat. They won't bring it up on their own accord because the flats are usually really low in comparison.", "NTA do you work in the Providence RI area? My old Toyota won\u2019t last forever", "NTA.\n\nThough I do think it would be a benefit for your business from now on to discuss, beforehand with the client, what they want you to push on, what they don't, what they would get uncomfortable from, etc. Just like a strategy with them before going into the dealership.", "NAH. I've purchased over 30 vehicles in the last 15 years. (Yes, I have a problem \ud83d\ude02) and I'd definitely pay for your services. \n\nI'm tired of doing it myself at this point -- dealerships thrive on the \"wearing you down\" or relying on you to not be \"rude\". Outside of homes, cars are usually the next biggest purchase someone is making and I'm not saying you need to make it so the dealership is losing money(they're not or they wouldn't continue to be in business) but you don't need to let them take advantage of you.\n\nIt CAN be super uncomfortable so maybe you could have given him a rundown/warning so he was better prepared? But idk you have to be prepared to just up and walk out or they'll emotionally manipulate you. My husband is too nice and is a pleaser so he knows he just needs to let me do it because he'll end up caving without me.", "NTA. Money is money as far as I'm concerned, and you've got a way to A make it and B help out your friends like you say.", "NTA - tell your bf if the car dealership wasn't still making a profit after your haggling, then they wouldn't sell you the car.", "NTA, first I wish prosperity in your op business, there are many women who are exploited or coerced in dealerships outside that you help several people and earn their money honestly, your boyfriend should be proud and look up to you and use you as an example of motivation for success, but if he thinks this is bad, maybe he needs to change boyfriends because this one was a total loss hahaha, by the way you should let him fall for the salesman's lip when he started to go to the dealership side", "Can I hire you?\n\nNTA, obviously. lol", "As a man i can assuredly tell you you destroyed his masculinity and he needed that reality check. Get yours you earned it it\u2019s not your fault he won\u2019t do the work. Also you are a NTA. Fragile ass ego what a maroon he should say thank you, take you out to dinner and buy you something nice with the 6 fucking thousand dollars you saved his lazy ass", "NTA\n\nOf course haggling is uncomfortable. These people are trying to rip you off. \n\nI'm kinda worried about how defensive he got about the sexism thing. It's pretty well known that car dealerships try to take advantage of people and that they will try to capitalize on the assumption that women know less about cars by raising prices. If he states you're making everything about sexism for something like this, I get the feeling he thinks sexism is incredibly rare...\n\nAnd I don't see anything wrong with your business model. The clients make more money in the end than they would without you, so they're still saving money. I'd love to hire someone like you because I know nothing about cars and hate arguing.", "NTA and it sounds like you have outstanding negotiation skills! Negotiation can be so uncomfortable for people who aren't prepared for it (and even those who are). Most people just aren't naturally equipped to engage in this kind of conflict and do just about anything to avoid it - which of course makes them prey for the sharks. \n\nIt sounds like you have a real talent. \n\nWhen it comes to your bf, a different style of negotiation might be in order. Empathy-based goes a long way with some people.\n\nEdit: if you're negotiating as part of a team, it's important that everyone is on the same page. Communication beforehand is critical. It's worth talking with people you negotiate for about it beforehand, including that it will probably be an uncomfortable process for them and that's ok - but they can't undermine you.\n\nI've also DMd you with details of a fantastic resource that you might find helpful.", "NTA.\n\nExcuses for the metaphor here, especially given the gender roles clearly on display in your post...\n\nYour boyfriend wanted the sausage, but he didn't know how it was made. Now that he's seen how it's made, he's feeling squeamish. If he didn't want to see it, he shouldn't have asked you along.\n\nDid he think haggling was a happy friendly thing where everyone just immediately comes to the best price and no one ever confronts anyone or tries anything sneaky?", "NAH at all! I say that as someone who is deeply, horrifically, terribly uncomfortable with haggling.  I recently bought a used car for sticker price, lol, because I won't haggle.  I have also physically walked away from several situations in which a travel buddy was haggling, because I thought it was undignified to try to get someone to take what amounted to a small latte off the price of a trinket in an underdeveloped country.  \n\nYou are doing people like me a great service in what you're offering at a car dealership, since there is no ethical concern in that situation.  I can totally see how your boyfriend might have been uncomfortable; I would have been.  I also wish I could have hired you!", "NTA keep hustling! What you're doing is awesome.", "NTA I would absolutely hire you if I was buying a car", "Absolutely NTA and it just goes to show how inflated prices are for them to be able to cut that much money off a purchase. I'm looking to buy/lease and would love if you came and helped me!\n\nI can see how it might be a bit uncomfortable for your boyfriend, especially if he's never seen you in that kind of situation before, but he should be grateful to have someone who knows what they're doing when it comes to a big purchase like a vehicle. To call you out about making \"everything about sexism\" is more about him feeling uncomfortable (and possibly somewhat emasculated) than it is about this situation.", "NAH does you bf usually avoid conflict? I that would make me uncomfortable but it is what he asked for. Seems like he asked you to do this without knowing what it entails. You did a good job though and he probably feels grateful for the deal but exhausted too.", "You take a 1/3 of the savings off of sticker?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA", "INFO: Are you M or F?", "Honestly I think you're a bit of an AH for charging that much - it doesn't take a lot of pushback to knock a few thousand off a dealers first offer and it sounds like your rate is probably working out to >$500/hr?\n\nBut if people want to pay it, you're certainly no more of an AH than the dealers.", "Aw thanks! \n\nI've been trying to market mainly to wealthy cash buyers because they're likely to just pay me an upfront sum. \n\nBut I also have an installment payment service set up so people can pay me off over up to a year. \n\nI'm not really able to get in on the financing agreement because that's going to be between the buyer and their lender.", "Here's the thing tho - I didn't even do anything that would make him seem less \"manly\"? \n\nLike the only people I spoke sharply to were the dealer and finance guy when they started putting high pressure sales tactics on me or trying to rip me off? \n\nBut when I talked to my boyfriend, I literally just talked him through what I was seeing during the inspection, not dumbing it down, just taking the time to explain the flaws I saw with the car and let him decide if he still wanted it. \n\nI honestly feel shocked he felt hurt or something, because I treated him with total respect the whole time, literally the only time I was sharp with anyone was when someone was trying to take advantage... \n\nAnd I also genuinely feel baffled because like... What did he expect? My business name is literally \"hardass for hire\"", "Bingo!", "Good. Keep it up!", "Seriously, I want to hire OP. I don\u2019t know jack about cars, and I know these places are always extra predatory with women. Last time I bought a car, I brought my dad to help me negotiate, and that dumbass argued for the salesman and got me to pay way more than I should\u2019ve. Forget haggling, he was full-on telling me the salesman was offering an amazing deal and I\u2019d be an idiot not to take it, etc etc. Like damn Dad, are you getting a cut??\n\nAnd that\u2019s half my genes.

His wife Peggy doesn\u2019t know about the deal and does all the research and comes prepared with receipts. \n\nIt all comes to a head when it\u2019s revealed that Hank\u2019s great deals over the years were actually just \u2018Sticker Price.\u2019 The Saleman convinced 18 year old Hank that all the other Saleman will add on extra fees on top of sticker so he\u2019s actually getting a great deal. \n\nHank believes him and never shops around again for the rest of his life, buys like 4 cars before his wife reveals he\u2019s been getting ripped off.", "> I think what you're doing should be a profession of it's own if it isn't already.\n\nThey're called lawyers. Most people wouldn't hire one for the sake of buying a car, but that's not to rain on OP's parade. It's a good service she offers, very specialized but clearly there's a demand for it.\n\nIt shouldn't be a profession of its own, because companies should simply have fair pricing to begin with. But they don't, and unless we get laws in place forcing it, there will always be an opening for someone like OP.", "Yeah. \n\nBasically if the first quote my client gets is, say 20 grand, and I'm able to negotiate that down to 17 grand, saving them 3 grand, they keep 2 grand of that, and I keep 1 grand.", "I also wonder if it's more about the money than anything? \n\nLike our finances have always been seperate, and a lot of my income is just going into long term stable investments, so it's pretty much invisible that I'm bringing in good money, I still drive a 7 year old car and have a modest house. \n\nHe knew about my side gig, in that he knew I'd help people (mostly other women) buy cars, but I never said what the fee was, and he was genuinely shocked I was pulling in at least 500 an hour but closer to 1000 in luxury car sales, which I'm focusing on now, doing this. \n\nI really felt like he went from feeling a little uncomfortable with my tactics, to super uncomfortable and finding the whole thing unethical, when I told him what I make.", "TBH they didn't treat him half as rough as they treat a lot of my female clients... There's absolutely a lot of sexism in the auto industry.", "I'm a woman", "A bit of context; most of my clients are people who don't want to haggle themselves or wouldn't be comfortable trying. Like when they've bought cars in the past, they've paid full sticker or only been able to negotiate a few hundred off.\n\nThey've all felt like what they save working with me (two to ten grand after my cut) is definitely worth it. \n\nIt is a high-pay low-hours gig, but I see it more as billing for my expertise then my time. Because yeah, if a sale goes through, I'm making $500 an hour minimum, sometimes closer to $1000 if I'm working in the luxury vehicle space. \n\nIt's not just the haggling, it's also my engineering degree, knowing cars inside and out, being able to point design flaws out to the client and use them as negotiating points. Being able to conduct a full inspection, being able to cross reference the issues found in inspection to a price-sheet to quote an estimated repair cost. Being very familiar with the methods dealerships try to get a little more money out of you at the end (funny numbers in the fees, predatory lending) and knowing how to avoid them...\n\nIt's also something my clients are happy to pay, especially the cash buyers. Because from their perspective, they could pay an upcharge of say 15 grand to a dealership, or 4,500 to me. And one of those numbers is a lottt lower than the other.", "Then don't hire her? Op's clients don't think she is an asshole for saving them $ they would have lost if she wasn't there to do the grunt work", "Sounds like a great business model!", "What you are doing is amazing! For years I've gotten by on used cars I bought from friends, generally towards the end of the car's life, because I just don't want to get ripped off at a dealership, and I don't know enough about cars to avoid it. Having someone haggle like that would well be worth the 33% cut.", "You were 100% in the right, but a lot of men have been raised that they're men and they just naturally are more knowledgeable/better at certain things.\n\nYou're doing a great thing for your friends and the people you're providing your services for.\n\nYeah, dealers often charge ridiculous prices. I was looking to buy a new car where I live, so I called up the dealer and they straight up admitted they tack on 8% on top of the already inflated price. So I went to a dealer by my parents, and it was about 6-7k less.", "He expected it to be a cutesy name on top of you being really feminine and nice and unimposing.", "The thing you did to make him feel less manly was \u201cbe better at the thing.\u201d \n\nThere\u2019s no way you could have approached this in a way that both protected his ego *and* saved him money. If you\u2019d dumbed yourself down to save his pride, you wouldn\u2019t have been an effective negotiator. He\u2019s just mad that he is less knowledgeable and more easily intimidated than you are. He was not prepared for the amount of assertiveness it requires to say \u201cno\u201d to a pushy salesperson, or the amount of time and attention it takes to make sure you\u2019re actually getting a good deal. And he\u2019s blaming you because being angry at you is more comfortable than being angry at himself.", "You absolutely did not do anything wrong, this is literally just how fragile men\u2019s sense of their masculinity is (and I say this as a man).", "You\u2019re a genius and a good person. Everyone wins in this scenario. I follow a woman on social media who does this and it\u2019s awesome. \n\nNTA and unfortunately men are as much victims of toxic masculinity as women. I\u2019d argue more so a lot of the time. \u201cToxic\u201d is the key word here. Masculinity is neither good nor bad, just a trait; toxic is when men feel someone else will call them out on stuff like this.", "> Here's the thing tho - I didn't even do anything that would make him seem less \"manly\"?\n\nNo, but he did, and now the rubber of his own notions of how manly he is has hit the road of him rolling over for the sales guy and expecting him to rub his tummy.\n\nYou saved thousands of dollars that he would have gladly forked over, and he needs to believe he's not a sucker! It's something you're doing wrong! But any angle you look at it, you're in the right here.", ">I didn't even do anything that would make him seem less \"manly\"?\n\nYou were dominant, he was submissive, in that situation. For some, that's enough.", "I\u2019d probably talk to him about it before listening to a bunch of strangers on the internet speculate about your partner\u2019s psychology.", "Nah it's definitely sexism. I see a notable difference in how my male clients are treated compared to myself and my female clients.", "Haha I'm nowhere close to a laywer, I just know cars. \n\nI so agree that this kinda job shouldn't need to exist, I wish manufacturers could just sell cars direct for a standard price, instead of this whole dealership model that lets people jack up the price if they think they've found an easy mark... It's ao unnecessary", "You da \ud83d\udc10 no \ud83e\udde2.", "Yeah, I may be a little different(I'm a guy), but when a woman earns more than a man some do get their knickers in a knot. Especially when it is in a role or position where a \"man\" is \"supposed\" to be dominant.  You're saving your clients significant amounts on purchases, and taking a nominal fee for bearing the brunt of the scummy tactics dealers and dealer finance officers try to pull.\n\nMight be time to have a convo about this with him, and see if he tells you his \"real\" issue with this.\n\nEdit: grammar/meaning", "You hurt his man feelings.\nN T A", "NTA at all. \n\nI\u2019m wondering if your BF is being an AH about this because you played a stereotypically male role very well. I think what you do is awesome though and absolutely giving scheming car salesmen what they deserve. Not only did you save him a bunch of money and not charge him for it but you have a skill that most people don\u2019t have access to. He should be proud of you and not angry with you. \n\nThe part that is most baffling to me is when the salespeople agrees to one price and then tried to back out of it with fine print. They are also the AHs. How does your boyfriend not see that?", "I can only applaud so loudly into the internet void\"", "I think your business is brilliant and a great idea! Good for you for coming up with it and I think it is business that is needed.

What's more, you're not just being a hardass, you're keeping track of the details and the fine print to make sure no one is pulling a fast one on your clients. \n\nI agree with you completely. Just do away with the dealer model altogether. The company produces the cars and sets a price based on the cost of the car and how much profit they need to make to sustain production and remain solvent. The best pricing shouldn't be reserved for those who are willing to call out the dealer bullshit.", "Which is just more sexism. Being a hardass isn't an aeathetic.", "I really want to be your friend.
