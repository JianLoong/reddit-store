Ones that are potentially harmful to others around them (Q), themselves (cults), or their family (mlms). \n\nI also wouldn't date someone who holds a silly little conspiracy because it's very important to me to have a partner who tries their best not to fall into the patterns of \"disagreeing with my belief is attacking me\" think, as Amy has clearly demonstrated here.

What is the dealbreaker is when you can't move past those differences.\n\nYou don't need to accept their views, but to have a respectful partnership you need to be able to accept that your partner has those view. I think OP setting boundaries and not argueing his views and accepting that  she won't change her mind is healthy but her reaction was not.\n\nIn my mind, her believing conspiracy theories is like people believing in a God.

We can get rovers to mars, we could get people to the moon again, we just don't want to.\n\n(imo, the photograph \"Earthrise\" was worth every penny spent getting to the moon, there are absolutely things there that are worth it)", "The JFK case is not the same, there were strange parts to that.

Many rational people are not sure about the JFK assassination.", "Pretty big of a leap to go from \"stupid about the moon landing\" to \"blatant antisemite\"", "I have several relatives who started like this.

That\u2019s where most of them seem to end up talking to other people who do get them, and who inevitably have additional questionable beliefs which aren\u2019t that questionable to someone who\u2019s already vehemently opposed to the idea we went to space.\n\nThat isn\u2019t to say this will be your fianc\u00e9, but I think it\u2019s important to acknowledge the fact it takes something special to genuinely disbelieve major historical events and get mad at people for presenting completely reasonable and vast amounts of proof.

So no, they are not actually that different. \n\nIt's just more socially acceptable for you to shit on your GFs conspiracy theory points of view rather than apply that logic to everyone.\n\nYou shouldn't have to defend something you don't believe in.

Maybe try that one again. \n\nYou also reveal (perhaps unintentionally) that you don\u2019t believe the moon landing happened, as you claim, there is no evidence to support it. Any objectivity you might have is suspect at best, and at worst, nonexistent. This \u201clogic\u201d you claim I selectively apply is in fact logic based on fact. The Bible is not a science manual. The mirror or the moon that allows us to determine distance via laser is not the Apple of Eden. They are completely different. All of this is also beside the point. \n\nI don\u2019t relish the fact that someone is wrong. Amy is my fianc\u00e9 and I love her: it pains me to think she is wrong about something that is so widely accepted to be true (and it\u2019s provably so, despite your claims of no evidence). \n\nFrom what I\u2019ve read, psychologists say that, when dealing with someone who believes in a conspiracy like this, trying to point out evidence that proves them wrong simply makes them more stubborn. They often have to come to that realization themselves. \n\nSo again, I opt not to defend or agree with her belief. I don\u2019t look forward to someone arguing with her, or having to say she\u2019s wrong in public. But I won\u2019t lie or enable it.

It\u2019s so weird that she only feels this way about one thing and I really don\u2019t believe it is the only thing.

Basically its about power and wanting to know something others don\u2019t, like a friends secret, it\u2019s fun to be in the know. Or she\u2019s in the \u201cliving in fiction\u201d group and it\u2019s more fun if she digs down and says she believes something despite the evidence given to her.  She\u2019s creating some mystery in her life.\n\nFinally, it could be as simple as not wanting to admit she changed her mind.  Once she declared the moon landing was fake and you initially fought her so hard on the topic, she can\u2019t back down and let you say \u201ctold you so\u201d.\n\nAn open and vulnerable dialogue might be all that\u2019s needed to move past this issue.
