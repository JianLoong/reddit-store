SIL married my brother when the boys were 7 and 8. They lost their mom at 5 and 6. She had been sick for a couple of years and my brother was back dating after six months, SIL was his third date, and they married after a few months of dating. SIL has always loved the boys. I remember her telling me before the wedding she hoped one day they might call her mom sometimes. She was also hoping she would be close to the boys maternal family. My brother just has me and our other sister who lives overseas and she has no family. So the maternal family were the only real extended family. \n\nThe boys do not call her mom. They never have. Their maternal family are also not close to SIL (or my brother for that matter but they never really were close).\n\nSIL and my brother TTC for many years and ultimately she had to come to terms with the reality she was not having a biological child. During those years of TTC she didn't withdraw from the boys or anything but she did tell me at one point she wanted to bring up to the boys that they could call her mom. I told her to let them come up with it on their own and to focus on just having a positive relationship.\n\nSIL went through early menopause a couple of years ago which permanently ended any hope she would get pregnant some day. Last year she and my brother sat the boys down and expressed that she would love to adopt them if they were willing. The boys were not. I heard about this via the boys who were not happy it was brought up. They felt it came out of nowhere and felt they had never given an indication they would want that.\n\nA month or two ago the topic was brought up again and then SIL asked the boys if they loved her in any real, meaningful way and whether there was something of a compromise that could happen where she be acknowledged as a mother to them. They said no to the adoption, no to calling her mom and they ignored the topic of whether they loved her or not. She pleaded with them to reconsider and said she would be an amazing second mom. That she would be there for them like always and would keep pouring her love into their lives. When they didn't agree it turned into an argument and the boiys left.\n\nSIL sobbed her heart out after this. I saw her and my brother for the first time since the request came up a second time the other day. SIL was talking about how much it hurt her. She brought up the maternal family again, saying she could not understand why they wouldn't want to add to the family and couldn't welcome her into their family and hearts. Then she was saying how she really thought the boys would feel like she had earned the adoption. My brother called them children and said they could ask in a few years ago and hopefully they will have grown up.\n\nI said the boys did not owe her an adoption and gently suggested they figure out a way to come to terms with it not happening. My brother was furious and SIL looked as though I betrayed her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681048376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gk2tz/aita_for_telling_my_brother_and_sil_that_my/", "score": 1916, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They've made it crystal clear what they do and don't want regarding this subject. Your sil has had it rough, but honestly sounds more like she needs therapy to come to terms with what she can't have. All she's doing is permanently damaging any relationship she could've had with your nephews. As for this:\n\n>She brought up the maternal family again, saying she could not understand why they wouldn't want to add to the family and couldn't welcome her into their family and hearts\n\nThat family lost their daughter, and had to watch as someone tried their hardest to take over their daughter's role, trying to effectively erase their daughter in the process.

The early death of your brother\u2019s first wife and her involvement in their lives for all these years does not entitle her to actual \u201cMom\u201d status via adoption or acknowledgement. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this behavior pattern before. My father\u2019s second wife had fertility issues and desperately wanted to be someone, anyone\u2019s mom. She couldn\u2019t reconcile herself to the fact that her line was ending and that she would never be a mother, so she left my dad. Left the husband after my dad. And, finally, adopted the child of her fourth husband\u2026. Extreme example, but just illustrates how much this means to some people. Your brother is in a very difficult situation, so now that you have spoken the truth I would leave it alone.", "NAH  \nYou're right, she isn't owed that, I don't really think anybody here is an asshole, it's just really fuckin sad situation, from all these years of her trying to the boys having other feelings about their own mom and your SIL, to your brother wanting to support her here, just all sad.  \nEdit: asshole designation.", "NTA.\n\nThe maternal side of the family can't \"accept her into their hearts\" etc because from the freaking jump she's been actively doing her best to totally erase their deceased daughter! She wants their daughter's children to call HER mom. What an unreal slap in the face for them. She's not their mother and she never will be. They are not children they're grown men and unless her ultimate goal is them cutting her out of their lives entirely she needs to back the hell off. They said no, and they mean no, and that should be the end of it. Just because she couldn't have children of her own doesn't mean she gets to install herself as the mother of another woman's children when it's not what they want. \n\nYou weren't mean or cruel or anything of the sort, you just told her the truth.", "Your SIL desperately needs therapy. Projecting her grief about her own infertility onto her step-kids at this level is really not okay at all. And I say that as an infertile woman myself. I'll be shocked if they want a relationship with her at all after this. \n\nYou are 100% correct and your brother and SIL have lost their minds trying to force this issue.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You can't force what's not there. The boys don't feel it.", "The boys are adults.  What makes SIL think that grown man would want to be adopted by her. Also what is up with all these delusional people  lately who they their late spouse's family will want to included their new spouse in their family? NTA.", "NTA.

Your SIL is not behaving in a resonable way.", "NTA.\n\nSorry, but there is no way to get through to your SIL. She has this stupid dream of imposing her will on these boys no matter how they feel about it. This isn't love. This is control.\n\nAll she is going to do is drive them away, and as soon as they can they'll terminate the relationship completely.\n\nBut she thinks she can tantrum her way into getting what she wants.

Although you were right in what you said, I wouldn't push the issue anymore - it seems they are not ready to hear it.", "NTA since she brought it up, backing the adults saying they don't want to be adopted is fine. It's time sis in law accepts the hand she was dealt.", "NTA.

You shouldve just listened and let them vent, and let them know you understood why they were upset. Telling someone already upset that they should \" come to terms with it not happening\"  was not helpful nor kind, so no wonder your brother was angry.\n\nThis request apparently came out of the blue to what are now two young men, so no wonder it all went pear shaped.", "&#x200B;\n\nYTA I don't think you were \"gentle\" about it if your brother is furious. \n\nYeah, here's the thing. Unless she was some kind of monster, then the nephews are pretty ungrateful and cold. This is why I would never recommend a woman become a step-parent, no matter how much you do for the children, or how much you treat them as your own, you'll just end up being the \"evil step-mother\".  Where men are hailed as some sort of hero for raising another man's kid, even if they contribute little or nothing, women always get sh\\*t on.  \n\nThe mother died after a long illness. Dad moved on shortly after her death. For him the marriage ended long before mom died. The sons are being unfair and acting like the step-mom is somehow responsible for \"stealing\" daddy's love.", "YTA  - it\u2019s none of your business, and you used \u2018ttc.\u2019", "YTA for getting involved and passing judgement.  It\u2019s perfectly fine for the boys to react the way they did but also perfectly fine for SIL to be upset about it.

It is 100% NOT YOUR BUSINESS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am going to add that your SIL has been those boys mother-figure for a very long time. Your SIL and brother may need to understand your nephews likely don't want to be disloyal to their deceased mother (which they may have few memories of - and yet, you did not even mention this, instead choosing to focus on how quickly your brother dated)... and that while she's been waiting years & years until they were adults, this caught them off-guard. \n\nI don't even think your opinion is valid, beyond just being not your business.", "Wrong time, wrong place. When people come to me with a problem, I try to determine which condition exists: do they want me to provide a solution, do they want me to provide feedback on their proposed solutions, or do they just want to bitch about it over a beer?\n\nThis situation was definitely the latter.\n\nYou should've let them vent, have a cry, be supportive to them, and so on. No need to rub salt in the ~~would~~ wound in that moment. This situation isn't going away any time soon, so you would have had plenty of time down the road to load them up with that blast of reality.\n\nYour position on the adoption was poorly timed but technically correct, which means that technically, YTA.\n\nedit cuz i cant spelz", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've been TTC for the last 4 years. It's devastating and causes so much pain when it's what you want more than anything.

SIL is just guaranteeing that the nephews will go no contact if she continues to force it on them.", "You right, thanks fellow redditor! fixin it now", "Exactly this.  Why would kids suddenly owe love to some random new stranger that their dad picked to bang / marry.

And yet, she has raised these young men and put in the dues of a parent so I\u2019m not going to call her an AH for being stung by their rejection; if it was just about calling her mum I\u2019d say N T A but I can\u2019t even imagine raising a child from the age of 7 and then they turn around and can\u2019t even say that they love you.

Sometimes it is done for inheritance purposes or I guess it might symbolize some kind of bond but for the most part it is a meaningless gesture. For minors it is significant since a legal parent has rights and duties to a minor child and also would theoretically be in the child's life even if the marriage ended since they were in fact their child just as much as a bio child\n\nIt is odd - at least to me - that a step parent who was in a child's life for a relatively long period of time and theoretically provided them with good parenting would not have been able to have a warmer relationship with the children but it is what it is and you can't demand feelings.\n\nPerhaps the SIL is very obtuse. That she thought she could have a relationship with the maternal family is a somewhat mind boggling. My brother died suddenly when my niece was five - there would have be no way that my parents would have had any kind of \"warm\" relationship with a new husband. They were reasonable people who wanted access to their grandchild so they would have been cordial to the extent required to be polite - but an actual relationship as if they were \"family\" would have been out of the question.", "nta", "NTA but the kids are.

Instead they act like assholes to her and give zero consideration to HER feelings and humanity.", "NTA\n\nEven though it\u2019s hard to hear, I think you were right to say what you did.\n\nThey need to listen to the boys who have made it clear more than once they do not want to be adopted. Although in this situation they are adults, children shouldn\u2019t be used to treat adult pain.\n\nthey don\u2019t owe her this, anymore than someone owes a boy a date because they were kind or bought them gifts. \n\nSIL has also made it clear her love and support are conditional and about her.\n\nSevering the legal connection between a parent and a child, altering their birth certificate - that\u2019s a huge thing. They don\u2019t consent. That\u2019s the end of it.", "NAH. I don't see what crime SIL did other than naively hoping and then being sad when life wasn't a fairy tale. She wasn't graceful in dealing with her pain of realizing two children she helped raise didn't have the same depth of feeling for her that she did for them. I feel like maybe folks could have a little empathy for her in that regard.\n\nThe boys are not to blame and it doesn't sound you were cruel. You mention that Dad dated 6 months and married two years after mom's death, but that doesn't sound unreasonable. If he was ready, why not? His sons don't owe him acceptance of his new spouse and he doesn't owe them years as a widower.\n\nYou don't mention any bad parenting other than this argument with the adult children, so it seems like a sad and uncomfortable situation but no real As.", "NAH.

I have a stepdaughter that is just as much a daughter to me as my biological ones. I gave her time to get to know me and build a relationship with her, she was very young when her father and I started dating so I knew she was protective of her daddy, as she should have been.

My dad married my mom and my mom said she may not be your mom but she is the grandmother of your children. Now there is a relationship. My brother and my uncle are very close. My father calls my grandmother multiple times a week. However I still feel bad for her. The rest of the family will acknowledge her but be cold.

There\u2019s somethings those boys haven\u2019t even told their father, let alone you. \n\nPeople have addressed the maternal family seeing her desperately trying to be their daughters replacement. So I don\u2019t need to comment on that. But there\u2019s something else there, a bigger reason.

Pushing for more - at this point demanding more - is just so inappropriate and will do nothing but make them distance themselves from her. They are probably already resenting her behavior.    \nIf it comes up again, ask her what's more important: being their step-mother who had somewhat of a parental role, or relegating herself to being only their father's wife, who demaned more than they could give her, so they ended up needing to distance themselves. She's asked, they have answered. If they ever change their minds, they will let her know.

I\u2019m judging them getting married that soon without making sure their young kids who just lost a parent understand and are ready for that major step, and starting family therapy, especially if the kids are upset by the new partner.

My actual point is pretty clear.  The children had no say and no choice in this.  They were just along for the ride.

It's time to accept reality and deal with it...especially now that they are adults and can...and possibly may...cut contact with her.  They get a say now.  And they've said it, loudly and clearly.   Time to accept it.  Honestly, it doesn't matter what I think here...it only matters what the kids (now adults) think, and decide for themselves, and they have decided that no, she will not adopt them.  \n\nAs for the rest of it... it depends, and is very dependent on the choices of others involved.   I was lucky enough that my mother passed when I was an adult and my father remarried well after I was out of the house.  So thankfully, she never had a hand in raising me.  She is my father's wife.
