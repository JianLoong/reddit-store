SIL married my brother when the boys were 7 and 8. They lost their mom at 5 and 6. She had been sick for a couple of years and my brother was back dating after six months, SIL was his third date, and they married after a few months of dating. SIL has always loved the boys. I remember her telling me before the wedding she hoped one day they might call her mom sometimes. She was also hoping she would be close to the boys maternal family. My brother just has me and our other sister who lives overseas and she has no family. So the maternal family were the only real extended family. \n\nThe boys do not call her mom. They never have. Their maternal family are also not close to SIL (or my brother for that matter but they never really were close).\n\nSIL and my brother TTC for many years and ultimately she had to come to terms with the reality she was not having a biological child. During those years of TTC she didn't withdraw from the boys or anything but she did tell me at one point she wanted to bring up to the boys that they could call her mom. I told her to let them come up with it on their own and to focus on just having a positive relationship.\n\nSIL went through early menopause a couple of years ago which permanently ended any hope she would get pregnant some day. Last year she and my brother sat the boys down and expressed that she would love to adopt them if they were willing. The boys were not. I heard about this via the boys who were not happy it was brought up. They felt it came out of nowhere and felt they had never given an indication they would want that.\n\nA month or two ago the topic was brought up again and then SIL asked the boys if they loved her in any real, meaningful way and whether there was something of a compromise that could happen where she be acknowledged as a mother to them. They said no to the adoption, no to calling her mom and they ignored the topic of whether they loved her or not. She pleaded with them to reconsider and said she would be an amazing second mom. That she would be there for them like always and would keep pouring her love into their lives. When they didn't agree it turned into an argument and the boiys left.\n\nSIL sobbed her heart out after this. I saw her and my brother for the first time since the request came up a second time the other day. SIL was talking about how much it hurt her. She brought up the maternal family again, saying she could not understand why they wouldn't want to add to the family and couldn't welcome her into their family and hearts. Then she was saying how she really thought the boys would feel like she had earned the adoption. My brother called them children and said they could ask in a few years ago and hopefully they will have grown up.\n\nI said the boys did not owe her an adoption and gently suggested they figure out a way to come to terms with it not happening. My brother was furious and SIL looked as though I betrayed her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681048376, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12gk2tz/aita_for_telling_my_brother_and_sil_that_my/", "score": 775, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They've made it crystal clear what they do and don't want regarding this subject. Your sil has had it rough, but honestly sounds more like she needs therapy to come to terms with what she can't have. All she's doing is permanently damaging any relationship she could've had with your nephews. As for this:\n\n>She brought up the maternal family again, saying she could not understand why they wouldn't want to add to the family and couldn't welcome her into their family and hearts\n\nThat family lost their daughter, and had to watch as someone tried their hardest to take over their daughter's role, trying to effectively erase their daughter in the process.

The early death of your brother\u2019s first wife and her involvement in their lives for all these years does not entitle her to actual \u201cMom\u201d status via adoption or acknowledgement. \n\nI\u2019ve seen this behavior pattern before. My father\u2019s second wife had fertility issues and desperately wanted to be someone, anyone\u2019s mom. She couldn\u2019t reconcile herself to the fact that her line was ending and that she would never be a mother, so she left my dad. Left the husband after my dad. And, finally, adopted the child of her fourth husband\u2026. Extreme example, but just illustrates how much this means to some people. Your brother is in a very difficult situation, so now that you have spoken the truth I would leave it alone.", "NAH  \nYou're right, she isn't owed that, I don't really think anybody here is an asshole, it's just really fuckin sad situation, from all these years of her trying to the boys having other feelings about their own mom and your SIL, to your brother wanting to support her here, just all sad.  \nEdit: asshole designation.", "NTA.\n\nThe maternal side of the family can't \"accept her into their hearts\" etc because from the freaking jump she's been actively doing her best to totally erase their deceased daughter! She wants their daughter's children to call HER mom. What an unreal slap in the face for them. She's not their mother and she never will be. They are not children they're grown men and unless her ultimate goal is them cutting her out of their lives entirely she needs to back the hell off. They said no, and they mean no, and that should be the end of it. Just because she couldn't have children of her own doesn't mean she gets to install herself as the mother of another woman's children when it's not what they want. \n\nYou weren't mean or cruel or anything of the sort, you just told her the truth.", "Your SIL desperately needs therapy. Projecting her grief about her own infertility onto her step-kids at this level is really not okay at all. And I say that as an infertile woman myself. I'll be shocked if they want a relationship with her at all after this. \n\nYou are 100% correct and your brother and SIL have lost their minds trying to force this issue.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. You can't force what's not there. The boys don't feel it.", "The boys are adults.  What makes SIL think that grown man would want to be adopted by her. Also what is up with all these delusional people  lately who they their late spouse's family will want to included their new spouse in their family? NTA.", "NTA.

Your SIL is not behaving in a resonable way.", "NTA.\n\nSorry, but there is no way to get through to your SIL. She has this stupid dream of imposing her will on these boys no matter how they feel about it. This isn't love. This is control.\n\nAll she is going to do is drive them away, and as soon as they can they'll terminate the relationship completely.\n\nBut she thinks she can tantrum her way into getting what she wants.

Although you were right in what you said, I wouldn't push the issue anymore - it seems they are not ready to hear it.", "NTA since she brought it up, backing the adults saying they don't want to be adopted is fine. It's time sis in law accepts the hand she was dealt.", "NTA.

You shouldve just listened and let them vent, and let them know you understood why they were upset. Telling someone already upset that they should \" come to terms with it not happening\"  was not helpful nor kind, so no wonder your brother was angry.\n\nThis request apparently came out of the blue to what are now two young men, so no wonder it all went pear shaped.", "&#x200B;\n\nYTA I don't think you were \"gentle\" about it if your brother is furious. \n\nYeah, here's the thing. Unless she was some kind of monster, then the nephews are pretty ungrateful and cold. This is why I would never recommend a woman become a step-parent, no matter how much you do for the children, or how much you treat them as your own, you'll just end up being the \"evil step-mother\".  Where men are hailed as some sort of hero for raising another man's kid, even if they contribute little or nothing, women always get sh\\*t on.  \n\nThe mother died after a long illness. Dad moved on shortly after her death. For him the marriage ended long before mom died. The sons are being unfair and acting like the step-mom is somehow responsible for \"stealing\" daddy's love.", "YTA  - it\u2019s none of your business, and you used \u2018ttc.\u2019", "YTA for getting involved and passing judgement.  It\u2019s perfectly fine for the boys to react the way they did but also perfectly fine for SIL to be upset about it.

It is 100% NOT YOUR BUSINESS.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: I am going to add that your SIL has been those boys mother-figure for a very long time. Your SIL and brother may need to understand your nephews likely don't want to be disloyal to their deceased mother (which they may have few memories of - and yet, you did not even mention this, instead choosing to focus on how quickly your brother dated)... and that while she's been waiting years & years until they were adults, this caught them off-guard. \n\nI don't even think your opinion is valid, beyond just being not your business.", "Wrong time, wrong place. When people come to me with a problem, I try to determine which condition exists: do they want me to provide a solution, do they want me to provide feedback on their proposed solutions, or do they just want to bitch about it over a beer?\n\nThis situation was definitely the latter.\n\nYou should've let them vent, have a cry, be supportive to them, and so on. No need to rub salt in the ~~would~~ wound in that moment. This situation isn't going away any time soon, so you would have had plenty of time down the road to load them up with that blast of reality.\n\nYour position on the adoption was poorly timed but technically correct, which means that technically, YTA.\n\nedit cuz i cant spelz", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I've been TTC for the last 4 years. It's devastating and causes so much pain when it's what you want more than anything.

SIL is just guaranteeing that the nephews will go no contact if she continues to force it on them.", "You right, thanks fellow redditor! fixin it now", "Exactly this.  Why would kids suddenly owe love to some random new stranger that their dad picked to bang / marry.

And yet, she has raised these young men and put in the dues of a parent so I\u2019m not going to call her an AH for being stung by their rejection; if it was just about calling her mum I\u2019d say N T A but I can\u2019t even imagine raising a child from the age of 7 and then they turn around and can\u2019t even say that they love you.

Sometimes it is done for inheritance purposes or I guess it might symbolize some kind of bond but for the most part it is a meaningless gesture. For minors it is significant since a legal parent has rights and duties to a minor child and also would theoretically be in the child's life even if the marriage ended since they were in fact their child just as much as a bio child\n\nIt is odd - at least to me - that a step parent who was in a child's life for a relatively long period of time and theoretically provided them with good parenting would not have been able to have a warmer relationship with the children but it is what it is and you can't demand feelings.\n\nPerhaps the SIL is very obtuse. That she thought she could have a relationship with the maternal family is a somewhat mind boggling. My brother died suddenly when my niece was five - there would have be no way that my parents would have had any kind of \"warm\" relationship with a new husband. They were reasonable people who wanted access to their grandchild so they would have been cordial to the extent required to be polite - but an actual relationship as if they were \"family\" would have been out of the question.", "nta", "NTA but the kids are.

Instead they act like assholes to her and give zero consideration to HER feelings and humanity.", "NTA\n\nEven though it\u2019s hard to hear, I think you were right to say what you did.\n\nThey need to listen to the boys who have made it clear more than once they do not want to be adopted. Although in this situation they are adults, children shouldn\u2019t be used to treat adult pain.\n\nthey don\u2019t owe her this, anymore than someone owes a boy a date because they were kind or bought them gifts. \n\nSIL has also made it clear her love and support are conditional and about her.\n\nSevering the legal connection between a parent and a child, altering their birth certificate - that\u2019s a huge thing. They don\u2019t consent. That\u2019s the end of it.", "NAH. I don't see what crime SIL did other than naively hoping and then being sad when life wasn't a fairy tale. She wasn't graceful in dealing with her pain of realizing two children she helped raise didn't have the same depth of feeling for her that she did for them. I feel like maybe folks could have a little empathy for her in that regard.\n\nThe boys are not to blame and it doesn't sound you were cruel. You mention that Dad dated 6 months and married two years after mom's death, but that doesn't sound unreasonable. If he was ready, why not? His sons don't owe him acceptance of his new spouse and he doesn't owe them years as a widower.\n\nYou don't mention any bad parenting other than this argument with the adult children, so it seems like a sad and uncomfortable situation but no real As.", "NAH.

NTA More people needed to have said this to her YEARS ago.", "NTA\n\nIf your SIL would love the boys as much as she says, she would respect their wants and wishes.\n\nIt seems that even though your SIL's intentions are good, they don't feel comfortable and she's only thinking about herself. And your bro is not being rational", "those are legal adults, and definitely not her children. NTA", "NTA. She sounds manipulative and off.\n\nI hope you can be there for your nephews. Your brother sounds like an AH for letting this go on so long. She sounds like an AH for being manipulative and acting entitled.", "NTA. Your brother moved so fast his children likely weren\u2019t ready. And whatever SIL did to replace mom just added onto their feelings of not accepting her.  And I\u2019m getting really fucking tired of women using infertility as an excuse for trying to push unwanted relationships onto others. From an infertile woman who never had biological children and has zero problem being addressed by my first name by my stepchild.", "NTA. They are not boys, they are young men who have made their positions known. They have known their stepmother for enough years to know how they feel about her. Continuing to push this on them and to try and guilt them into something they don\u2019t feel is kind of cruel, IMO.", "NTA- and as an adoptee I firmly believe there is a reason that some people can\u2019t have children. This woman would have been a horrible mother. There\u2019s a reason those boys never attached to her.", "This is tragic. \n\nBut the boys are adults now. Time to accept whatever they say about a second mom and move on. \n\nNAH.", "NAH\n\nI feel badly for SIL.  It's not her fault they don't love her despite earning it.", "NTA . If it didn't happen when they were younger, it won't happen now that they are full grown adults. How does she feel about adopting a kid ? Like, one that actually is in line for adoption.", "I had to double checks the \u201ckids\u201d ages. They aren\u2019t kids. They can make up their own minds Nta", "NTA\n\nYour SIL and brother have been trying to force this for years with no success. The boys had a mother and they don\u2019t want another. SIL needs to accept that and just stop. \n\nI\u2019m sorry they do not have children of their own. They need to just adapt to the situation and move on. If they don\u2019t, all they will do is push those boys away", "They were kids when OP\u2019s SIL joined the family.", "NTA but I wonder if the brother is. I wonder how much of the actual parenting duties did he have SIL do? He moved on awfully quickly, was it to fill the vacancy in bringing up two small children? It's been 14 years. All this laundry, snot, school dropoffs, who was actually doing it between them? Because if he effectively parentified her and now shrugs and washes his hands of it, he's TA too. \n\nHe could have told her \"look, they are mine and it might be all that we're going to have, you put your feet up and be \"dad's new wife\" only as I parent them\". But this line \"My brother called them children and said they could ask in a few years ago and hopefully they will have grown up.\" makes me think that he was comfortable dangling the carrot, and still is.", "She has no family of her own so I think she saw the maternal family is very close and wanted to be part of that.", "The children are not obligated to \u201cmove on\u201d when the parent does. Their coldness MAY result from the fact that it was too soon for them.\nIt is also perfectly ok for them to feel that their late mom is the only one who deserves the title. It\u2019s their choice who they give the title to.", "They were 7 and 8 and remember their mother.   \n\n\nWhat about their humanity? What about their feelings?   \n\n\nNo. They have no duty or obligation to ever accept her as their mother. None at all. Their father's relationship with her is his relationship with her.  \n\n\nRelationships are two sided, and no, just \"being there\" isn't enough. And if she was willing \"to step up for them from the jump\", that would include respecting their complete valid feelings.", "TBF, the brother by the sounds of it knew his wife was dying fir years. He didn't cheat on her, but had mourned her loss before she died. I", "Yes, young children still coping with losing their mother and now having to deal with some woman trying to replace their mom. Now they aren't children anymore, so presumably they know how they feel after that much time. Their feelings on this situation need to be respected.", "Really? So why the problem with acknowledging she was the mother that was there for them when the bio mom died?  It's an adult adoption. There's no name change. They're not losing their bio mom's family or their bio mom. The only thing that changes is inheritance laws, they'd be their step-mom's heir (provided she outlives the dad) and they could make end of life decisions ( provided she outlives the dad).  \n\nYou don't think that ***tiny*** bit of gratitude is owed the woman? She was the mother that raised them. The birth mother was sick and unable to raise them and then died. Most of the mothering was done by step-mom.", "So someone who cooked, cleaned, took care of you and did most of the parenting shit your bio parent didn't do or couldn't do doesn't deserve gratitude of some kind?  No acknowledgment at all?  \n\nThey're adults. Adult adoption just means they inherit her stuff when she's dead. And make end of life decisions in case she can't make them anymore. \n\nYeah, you know what, f\\*\\*k these ungrateful a-holes.  And f\\*\\*k anyone who thinks like this.", "Because anyone who acts badly MUST have a disorder. ANY disorder. And it must be undiagnosed too. ADHD, Bipolar, whatever. People can't be just horrible on their own.", "I can\u2019t imagine how hard that is to go thru, but my heart goes out to u. I got my tubes tied when I was 23 and I still feel guilty when I hear stories like this. I wish there was a way to transfer fertility from the chics who either don\u2019t want or can\u2019t take care of kids to the chics who would do anything to have a child. I feel like anything else I say just won\u2019t b right so I\u2019ll stop there. Wish u the best!", "I could imagine it if SIL is estranged from her own family. But while that would be very sad for SIL, it doesn't obligate anyone to replace what she lost.", "Because no matter what she did, they only view one woman as their mom. I know to them she's not their biological or birth mom, she's just mom. That has been made clear by them. They have said it; they only have one mom and while they do have a stepmom, she has never been their mom. At least to them.\n\nI don't consider an adoption a tiny bit of gratitude. It's a big thing to many people, even if it is an adult adoption.", "Realize that a step parent \u2018being there\u2019 for any amount of time doesn\u2019t mean their step kids have to acknowledge them in any way. Sometimes they\u2019re just the person that their parent married. They aren\u2019t entitled to any special treatment or acknowledgement for being their step parent.", "Wow... What you're saying is pretty much the \"nice guy approach\". You know, those guys who think that just because they treat a woman nicely they're entitled to a relationship/sex with her?", "Gratitude? Maybe. That's up to them honestly.   \n\n\nThe title of Mom? No. That's way beyond simple gratitude. They don't owe her that out of any sense of obligations for decisions they did not make or agree to.", "She chose to take on that role, they didn't ask for another mother, they can be thankful for what she's done for them, but they don't owe her an adoption out of it or to be called mum.\n\nShe should've respected their decision the first time they told her no.", "Please, please don't ever feel guilty. Whilst I'm devastated that it hasn't happened for me, I'm thrilled that women are able to take steps like you have to ensure they never end up in a position they don't want to be in. That takes so much courage and determination to stand up and say you know what you don't want. I've had friends who have had to fight to get their tubes tied and been told no because they may change their minds. Im thrilled when anyone is able to be heard over choices about their bodies, whatever the choice may be.", "Yeah, even in that situation with no family, it would still be something that needed to come from the maternal family and not an obligation put on them. (I realise that's basically what you said, but I guess for someone like SIL it really can't be said enough!)", "It took us 5 years to conceive. Don\u2019t give up. There\u2019s lots of different treatments available and new things being developed all the time. I hope you are lucky like I was/am. Wishing you all the best.", "I find SIL\u2019s hunger for family pitiful and sad. I feel very sorry for her, she has all my sympathy. However she\u2019s clearly not thinking rationally about the people in her life. It is not appropriate to cultivate the dead woman\u2019s family, nor is it realistic to try to adopt full grown stepchildren. These are clearly SIL\u2019s attempts to fill a serious void in her life, but they\u2019re counterproductive and everyone is getting upset with her. Please don\u2019t. She needs counseling! She needs professional help in coming to terms with her losses without being judged. Life has smashed her dreams. She\u2019s not dealing with it very well, and I believe the response of those around her should be gentle and empathetic."]}
