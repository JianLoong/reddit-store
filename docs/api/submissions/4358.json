{"id": 4358, "submission_id": "zhcux0", "title": "AITA for making my mom cry and not defending my dad?", "selftext": "Me (25f) and my husband (26m) have been married for 3 years. We don't like kids and we're not planning on having any. I'm trying to get my tubes tied and hubby is scheduled for a vasectomy in 2 weeks. We come from families with an average of 5 kids per couple and unfortunately we happened to be the oldest which meant that we were second parents for our siblings. So we both know what parenting means and neither of us wants to experience that again. \n\nThat makes us the first in our families that will not have kids ever. We aren't close with them as a result of the treatment we received as kids but we keep in touch. Mostly just for family functions. My MIL and FIL aren't happy with our decision but respect it and they do their best to avoid baby talks with us. My parents however... They have 0 respect and tolerance for anything outside of their circle of interest.\n\nWe had dinner at my parents' house last night for my dad's b-day and of course the main topic wasn't my dad's b-day but when me and hubby are going to give them grandkids. We politely told them we aren't planning on having kids and asked to discuss something else. They went on a rant about how bad they want grandkids and we are horrible for denying them that.\n\nI've been telling them I don't want kids ever since they first asked but they don't want to accept my answer. Usually I will try to change the topic or just leave early but last night I had enough so I told them that my decision is final and if they keep pressing I will cut them off completely because I was sick of being disrespected so they either accept and respect my decision or they wouldn't have a relationship with me anymore.\n\nMy mom started crying and my dad got mad and started screaming profanities at me for upsetting my mom but my husband stood up and yelled louder that if he ever raises his voice at me he will need a new set of teeth. Then we left. \n\nI had to turn off my phone because of all the calls and text I was receiving from family members. I guess my parents told everyone what happened and now I'm TA for making my mom cry and also because I didn't defend my father.\n\nI want to make it clear that my husband isn't normally a violent person! However, he will do anything to protect me. My dad verbally abused me  my entire childhood which left me with PTSD so my husband is a bit overprotective when he's around me.\n\nI know people will ask if my parents know about the medical procedures we want to have done and the answer is no because we know they will not agree and last time we did something they disapproved of it didn't end well. We will tell them after it's already done. \n\nBut AITA for making my mom cry and not defending my dad?", "created_utc": 1670629775, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zhcux0/aita_for_making_my_mom_cry_and_not_defending_my/", "score": 674, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Family members believe I'm TA for upsetting my mom and not defending my dad when my hubby yelled at him but my in law family thinks i did nothing wrong.
