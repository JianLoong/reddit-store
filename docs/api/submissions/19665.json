I know this is part insecurity and part being a very sentimental person. He has tattoos dedicated to his ex, and this ring he wears.\n\nI\u2019ve brought it up before. Pls take it off, it makes me feel uncomfortable. My therapist told me to voice my feelings and this will help my insecurities bc I am living my truth. Anyway, he disagrees and respectfully chooses to still wear the ring.\n\nI told him this kind of thing would mean a lot to me and that he should be understanding of this. But he still wears it. \n\nAm I the A?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Does he have other rings?", "NTA for voicing your opinion and seems like you asked in a very reasonable manner, however it depends on the reason he still wears it, is it because he still has feelings for her, that he really likes it, if so can you not get one the same and switch it (with his knowledge) or did she pass on, or did they break up very amicably?", "NAH. It\u2019s great to voice your truth\u2014but  careful not to veer into controlling territory. \u201cHe should be understanding\u201d sounds an awful lot like you mean he should cave to your will and remove the ring. Do you understand why wearing that ring\u2019s important to him?  That didn\u2019t come across in your post. \n\nYou told him your truth\u2014it bothers you. He\u2019s told you his truth\u2014he\u2019s not ready to stop wearing the ring. Now you get to decide to a) accept this, b) discuss more to understand each other better and maybe find a compromise, or c) walk.", "This is a shit situation, so shit answer. \n\nYes, he got them when he was with his ex, but you equally have no right to make him take them off. It's his choice. If you are uncomfortable with anything similar in nature to this about your partner, and he stands firm that he has no intentions of removing them, I think its mutually respectable for you to consider your longterm plans together. \n\nNAH but shit situation.", "NAH.\n\nRespect is mutual. He's every bit as entitled to understanding from you regarding his keeping the ring as you are from him by removing it.\n\nTry to find a middle ground, or compromise in other ways.", "NAH - You're right to ask, but he's also allowed to wear what he likes, regardless of its origin.", "Info: is this a wedding ring? Does the ring fit his other accessories or style? What is your bf and ex's relationship like now?\n\nThis is so little information", "Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why did she give him the ring? Is it a sentimental thing for him or does he just like it? Are they still friends? Who broke up with who?", "This definitely feels like one of the threads where OP will disclose in a random comment that the ex was his wife who died tragically while pregnant.", "This is very strange. I once saw my college ex wearing a bracelet I gave him when we were dating. I politely messaged him later and told him he could take that shit off. It was creepy from that perspective, I\u2019d be real weirded out if I was you.", "Info: is the ex dead?", "What\u2019s the story behind the ring though? Did her ex die and this is his tribute to her? Or does he just view it as an unimportant decorative trinket that he wears to complete his outfit? It seems like context is needed here", "NAH\n\nTaking off the ring would be simple (physically -- I'd explore why it's not easy emotionally before doubling down); \"taking off\" the tattoo would be more effort.\n\nMy ex had a matching tattoo with his ex wife that he was going to cover up \"some day,\" and yet he didn't do it while for the several years we were together. I'm not saying it was a glaring sign of his lack of commitment that  he never bothered but it was one of several signs, for me.  Every relationship is different, but you need to get to WHY he won't make these changes.", "Not the answer. At all.", "It is. And wasn\u2019t talkin to u. Not like the ex died or something, he can keep the ring in his top drawer", "Isnt. And dont give a shit. \n\nYour childishness is the reason you can't and won't maintain a serious relationship. \n\n:)"]}
