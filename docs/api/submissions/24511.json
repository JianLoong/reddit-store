{"id": 24511, "submission_id": "15phmv2", "title": "AITA for not receiving a female Airbnb guest late at night?", "selftext": "Hi, Reddit. This happened a few hours ago and I am feeling  bad about it. I am not sure if I was in the right and I want an outsider view of it.  \nI am an AIRBNB host. I don't live in the flat that I rent out. I get nearly all the nights reserved on the app and I have never had any major issues.  \nThe process is simple: someone makes a reservation, I ask for the estimated arrival time, I go clean the house and prepare it for check-in, and wait for the guest. It's very straightforward.  \nI am flexible about check-in and check-out, but as I don't live in the flat, I need some communication with the guest to make it work. Unfortunately, because of the setup, I cannot offer self-check-in.  \nAnyways, I receive a reservation three days ago. The guest texts me to say she's thrilled to stay at my place for one night as she has a flight the next day. I answer exactly one minute later to say I'm happy to host her and to please tell me her estimated time of arrival so I can go wait for her in the flat.  \nA day goes by and the next day I text her again in the morning to please confirm at what time she thinks she will arrive. She does not reply. I text her again a few hours later for a third time, asking for her estimated time of arrival. Again, no answer.  \nThe day of the reservation comes in. I wake up and the first thing I do is to ask her at what time she is arriving, now for the fourth time. I get her WhatsApp number and text her over there to explain I am her Airbnb host, and I need to know at what time is she planning to arrive. She received the message but did not reply again. Now this is the fifth time and I am getting pissed. It is a Saturday, and I am expecting to rest and make my own plans during the weekend after working full-time during the week - I was just trying to plan my day around her arrival but she is not answering at all.  \nI call Airbnb support to try and cancel the reservation or get assistance, and they say they cannot reach the guest either. I text her for the sixth time at 3 pm on her arrival date.  \nI then text her for the seventh time, at 7 pm, explaining I will not be able to receive her anymore.  \nThen, at 10:30 pm she texts me saying she arrived in the city 30 minutes ago. She \"was traveling\". She will be in the house in 10 minutes. Now, as I explained I don't live in the flat. I live one hour away. It's 10:30 pm. And then she says she cannot understand how I can leave a girl traveling alone without a place to stay. She immediately cancels the reservation and I guess she found another place to stay.  \nI reply to her almost immediately to explain that I waited for her all day and that for three full days, I tried to get an answer from all the methods I could and she did not reply. She hasn't read my messages and that's it, but I'm just feeling terrible.  \nI think I could be the asshole for not waiting for her in the house all day and leaving a female traveler without a place to stay late at night.

You did your due diligence, this is on her.", "NTA- If I don\u2019t know my check in time or it\u2019s late I\u2019ll find a place with self check in.\n\nPeople forget that Airbnb isn\u2019t all houses like hotels. I\u2019ve rented from families with kids that have a couple spare rooms where check in ends at 10pm because they need to get to bed or work the next morning.", "Did she violate AirBnBs policies in any way? If not, YTA.", "Yes, you're right. This hassle is not worth it for anyone involved.", "Exactly! When I am traveling and I want flexibility, I am always happy to pay the full rate for a hotel.", "I do get my money anyway and I feel kind of guilty about it. My main worry is her safety. I live in a very safe city, and I was even willing to go at that time to check her in, but she canceled right away after saying I left her without a place to stay and did not reply anymore. Anyways, I just wanted an outside opinion on this. Thanks for commenting!", "NTA. She learned a valuable lesson in communication she\u2019ll never forget.", "After seven years of using Airbnb on three continents, I have only been offered one (1) self-check-in and it was in a very high-end listing. This is not the case. My listing is more on the affordable side, and because it's an old European building, there is simply no way to leave the keys anywhere. That is why I don't offer and of course, don't advertise self-check-in.", "Absolutely not. It takes about 30 seconds to open them without leaving a trace. All it takes is watching a YouTube video, anybody can do it.\n\nAs a guest, I'd strongly dislike the key to my temporary home being stored in such an insecure manner, where anybody can steal it and have copies made.\n\nAs host and owner of a property, not gonna happen either, for obvious reasons.", ">If you live an hour away, you need to have a way for self check in imo.\n\nShe doesn't. She needs to advertise that there's no self check-in, which apparently she does.\n\n>If I was a single female, I\u2019d be weirded out by a host demanding to know exact arrival time and insisting on waiting for me at the flat.\n\nThat's solely a you-problem. If that's the case, you simply shouldn't book places that offer no self check-in. Or lock yourself in at home, that seems to fit your mindset better anyway.\n\nIn my experience in Europe, it's about 50:50. And of course I am expected to share my time of arrival in advance. What else?!", "I am a female host. And I don't need an exact time, just an estimated time so I can plan my day around her arrival. Self-check-in is simply not possible, and I don't have it advertised in the listing obviously.", "What an awful take. It isn\u2019t \u201cweird\u201d to ask for an estimated arrival time. You expect the host to just sit in the place and wait all day?", "Then stay in a hotel?", "Yeah, I am considering this. It's exhausting.", "That\u2019ll be true when women aren\u2019t thousands of times more likely to be sexually assaulted.", "I am talking about a +250 years old building in the centre of a major European city. I cannot deliberately add a code box outside in the main door of the building as I don\u2019t own the entire building. This is not allowed by the rules of the building. Even if I put a safety box with a key, it must be inside the building, and who is supposed to let the guest in? If I am saying that self check in is not possible, it is because I have researched every possible way and I am 100% sure it is not possible. The post is not asking for ideas on how to add self check in as I clearly explained that it is not possible (here and in the Airbnb listing). The post is about the situation and how it was handled.", "Yup I don't want to deal with those issues, have to meet the owner of the place or stay in someone else's place.", "Her safety is not your responsibility. If she had contacted you in a reasonable time she would have been fine.", "Huh. Weird. I\u2019ve only gotten airbnbs in the states and they\u2019re all self check in with those electric code locks", "I've been to places where there has been arrangements with a cornershop nearby where they are open all hours and we have picked up keys drom there. Otherwise it is usually lock boxes with the key or a numerical lock instead.", "This is common. Has been the case every time I\u2019ve booked an Airbnb, don\u2019t listen to them.", "She projects her fears and makes them other people's problems.\n\nRealistically of course, for safety it makes zero difference whether a host knows the time of arrival or not. If they mean the guest harm, they have a spare key either way.", "And deeply unethical.  I'm glad you had a bad day.", "Well do have yourself the day you deserve with that response. \n\nWow. Is it Tuesday?", "A lot of places that have professional management have the coded locks and things like that. \n\nGenerally, when it\u2019s just people managing it on their own, it\u2019s not a self check-in. \n\nI would say in my experience it\u2019s been about 50/50 for self check in vs. Meeting the hosts"]}
