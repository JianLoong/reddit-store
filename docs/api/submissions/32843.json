{"id": 32843, "submission_id": "18g73xa", "title": "AITA for taking my earbuds out of my wife's sister's hands?", "selftext": "Ever since I was a teenager, I(39M) have been dealing with anger issues. My folks sent me over to an anger counselor when I was 16. He wasn't able to help me get rid of the anger, we tried medication, meditation, breathing exercises but the anger still remained, so he then focused on teaching me coping strategies and ways to navigate my anger so that other people won't be affected. From that point on, if I were standing up and getting mad, I would usually sit down(I'm a pretty large dude), blink a lot and try to break away my gaze since I was told that helps, but if all else fails I just leave. I have earbuds that I've had for over 5 years, and I take them and just listen to music away from everyone else. I have a special anger playlist I\u2019ve been working on for a while, I\u2019ve assembled all kinds of songs on it.   \n\n\nThis has helped me a lot but it's not always easy. For instance, my wife and I were having a huge argument over something that I'm not going to talk about. It started small, but escalated, largely spurred on by her sister, who was also participating and almost subtly egging me on.  \n\n\nI told them both that I had enough and I stood up(I was in a sitting position). I took my earbuds out of my pocket and headed outside to my spot, but my wife's sister blocked the door. I tried to pull her away from the door but as I reached my hands she took my earbuds. At that point, I was so over everything, I told her to give my earbuds back, she said that we needed to talk about this and that I can't just leave, I told her again, but she tried to give my earbuds to my wife so I quickly grabbed them out of her hands and then loaded up my \"anger\" playlist.  \n\n\nWhen I got home, my wife locked me out, and made me wait outside for 30 minutes. When I was finally let in, my wife's sister had left, but my wife said that what I did wasn't ok. I thought I was deescalating and preventing anything from happening, but my wife said that I scared her and her sister.  \n", "created_utc": 1702335963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18g73xa/aita_for_taking_my_earbuds_out_of_my_wifes/", "score": 54, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's on her. You don't get to provoke a confrontation, and then complain that the confrontation scared you. Walking away to calm down should always be OK. Wife's sister is an asshole, and frankly, your wife sucks as well because she should understand your anger issues and know that physically blocking you in is a bad idea. She gets a partial pass, because sticking up for you while she's in the middle of arguing with you is hard.", "Im not sure there is totally enough info to fully judge everything. In terms of your specific headline question NTA for taking your own property back which she snatched off you.\n\nDoes your wife understand you have anger isssues and specific coping mechanisms when getting overwhelmed? Id guess so, but from her not stepping in to tell her sister to let you go im not so sure. I dont think you are wrong to walk away. Even for someone without anger problems, sometimes taking a break to calm down and then come back in a more rational mood is a good plan", "NTA and honestly just from your title not the answer I was expecting to give. Sir you need to think long and hard about this. I don\u2019t wanna go the nuclear route but I immediately thought they were trying to get you to do something stupid to get you arrested. There\u2019s no reason your wife should have even began to allow her sister to attempt to set you off. \n\nPlease be careful and remember this just in case. I don\u2019t wanna see you get arrested and lose your entire life while your wife skips away\u2026and yes I do understand that\u2019s extreme, but her loving you and allowing that is too.", "NTA. Your SIL was escalating the situation as you were trying to de-escalate it. You know your limits and you were trying to adhere to what has been working for you so you can keep control of your anger. She did everything she could to stop you from your process.\n\nShe's TA here though it does sound like she isn't familiar with your anger management process. Might be a good idea to sit down with her and your wife and explain it to them.", "NTA.  \n\n\nOh HELL no.  People do NOT get to hold you against your will.  PERIOD.  \n\n\nYou tried to resolve this issue, several times and in a reasonable manner until you were pushed to physically take your property back and escape from their attempt to hold you hostage to their insistence that you sit and take their nagging arguing behavior.  \n\n\nYour past anger issues aren't really relevant in this case and even so, you did well in sticking to your tricks that work.  Taking back your own property is not anger.", "Exactly *why* is your SIL so involved in your marriage? My dude, you have a wife problem. NTA.", "NTA.  People who are actually afraid of someone don't block their exit or take something from them.  Trust me on that.  They are using your anger issue to get the upper hand in your argument or to justify their actions.\n\nYou may have an anger problem, but you have a pretty big wife problem that is poking at the anger problem.  Her sister should not be interfering or participating in your arguments.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not fair or nice to be ganged up on in an argument.\n\nPreventing you from leaving is a crazy thing to do.\nIf a man was blocking a woman from leaving the house police would be called.", "NTA. Your wife's sister has no right to be in an argument between you and your wife. You need to set a hard boundary about that. AFTER that, you need to have a discussion with your wife about how it's okay for her sister to things from you but not you from her. This was a two against one and it was extremely unfair.", "NTA. You tried to deescalate the situation by leaving and your wife's sister blocked your way, which was in no way okay. She then took your personal property. You remained calm enough to leave and use your coping strategies.", "I don\u2019t have enough information to draw an informed conclusion, but you should be able to step away from arguments. Every therapist (individual and couples) has always told me that I, as a person with anger, should always step away when I\u2019m not seeing or thinking straight. As you were cornered physically and in the argument, your reaction is only going to get worse out of defense.", "NTA. Sister should\u2019ve stayed in her lane. Her preventing you from leaving is illegal. Your wife should be also spoke up and stopped her sister from escalating the situation. \n\nSide note: bravo on learning how to cope with your anger in a healthy fashion.", "NTA. Especially if you made it clear that you were just trying to calm down. She had no right trying to take your property from you or to try to block exit in your own home. Plus she probably shouldn\u2019t have been present for this argument if that was something between you and your wife, even if it was about her.", "Info is needed \n\nDid they get scared only when you weren\u2019t able to leave so the anger started to build? If that\u2019s the case then I do think your wife should be more sympathetic to the fact you know when you need to disengage and she should\u2019ve immediately called her sister off.", "Respectfully, your wife is the TA. She knows your struggle and your strategy. She allowed her sister to provoke you.", "NTA: Your wife is trying to set you up as an abuser during the divorce. Get away from her.", "NTA.  I'm a woman with anger issues.  People tend to think it's funny or ok to push my buttons because hey what can a little woman do?  Then when I react in a way they didn't expect, they get scared.  I feel for you and I applaud you for knowing your limits and how to de-escalate.\n\nYou really have a wife issue.  Her sister should not be involved in your marital business/disagreements.  In fact, no one should ever be involved in a married couple's business.  If someone inserted themselves into a convo or disagreement between me and my husband, I would tell them to mind their own business or I may even kick them out the house.  Also, your wife should not be locking you out of your own home.  If my husband ever purposefully locked me out of my house, I'm like 99% sure we would be divorcing.  It's that serious to me.  Idc how mad he is at me, never disrespect me in such a way.  She sounds like she could be abusive, however I don't know her you do so you can answer that for sure.  I strongly suggest marriage counseling.  If she won't go, there's your answer to how she values the marriage.  At least continue your individual therapy because people like that will try to get a reaction out of you, especially since they know about your anger issues.", "NTA how is it fine for her to snatch them from you, but scary if you snatch them back?", "Info. No where near enough to give an answer.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing I hate more than women who talk and act big regressing to \u201cbeing scared of a big angry man\u201d that they know damn well won\u2019t physically hurt them. Give me a break. She was treating you how parents treat bad kids by snatching their stuff away. Unacceptable.", "I think they were absolutely trying to set you up", "Nta they barricaded you in thiis controlling abusive behavior.    They know you have been working on anger issues weroponzing that against you\nTalk to your counselor about this.", "NTA, sil shouldn't be snatching your property from your hands nor blocking your way out either both actions she did was illegal, seriously your wife is talking about what you did wasn't ok when she allowed, her sister to do 2 things she knows is definitely not ok for anyone to do.", "Nta- you were walking away to de-escalate the situation and your SIL tried to stop you. \nBig hugs!!", "NAH\n\nIt think it's fine and appropriate for you to leave to control your behavior. BUT you may need to communicate that while leaving - otherwise it can look like ending the argument by storming out.\n\nWhile I give god odds that SIL is TA, I can't tell with the info given. Without knowing what the argument was about I can't say id it involved her legitimately or if it was something with urgency where walking away was also problematic.", "NTA - your wife is wrong and her sister should not be inserting herself into you and your wife's business. When the arguement started while her sister was there, your wife or you should have said \"we can discuss this later in private\" and your wife should backed you on this. When SIL took your earbuds, your wife should have told her to give them back and for SIL to butt out. And she certainly shouldn't have locked you out.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
