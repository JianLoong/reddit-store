My folks sent me over to an anger counselor when I was 16. He wasn't able to help me get rid of the anger, we tried medication, meditation, breathing exercises but the anger still remained, so he then focused on teaching me coping strategies and ways to navigate my anger so that other people won't be affected. From that point on, if I were standing up and getting mad, I would usually sit down(I'm a pretty large dude), blink a lot and try to break away my gaze since I was told that helps, but if all else fails I just leave. I have earbuds that I've had for over 5 years, and I take them and just listen to music away from everyone else. I have a special anger playlist I\u2019ve been working on for a while, I\u2019ve assembled all kinds of songs on it.   \n\n\nThis has helped me a lot but it's not always easy. For instance, my wife and I were having a huge argument over something that I'm not going to talk about. It started small, but escalated, largely spurred on by her sister, who was also participating and almost subtly egging me on.  \n\n\nI told them both that I had enough and I stood up(I was in a sitting position). I took my earbuds out of my pocket and headed outside to my spot, but my wife's sister blocked the door. I tried to pull her away from the door but as I reached my hands she took my earbuds. At that point, I was so over everything, I told her to give my earbuds back, she said that we needed to talk about this and that I can't just leave, I told her again, but she tried to give my earbuds to my wife so I quickly grabbed them out of her hands and then loaded up my \"anger\" playlist.  \n\n\nWhen I got home, my wife locked me out, and made me wait outside for 30 minutes. When I was finally let in, my wife's sister had left, but my wife said that what I did wasn't ok. I thought I was deescalating and preventing anything from happening, but my wife said that I scared her and her sister.  \n", "created_utc": 1702335963, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18g73xa/aita_for_taking_my_earbuds_out_of_my_wifes/", "score": 511, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's on her. You don't get to provoke a confrontation, and then complain that the confrontation scared you. Walking away to calm down should always be OK. Wife's sister is an asshole, and frankly, your wife sucks as well because she should understand your anger issues and know that physically blocking you in is a bad idea. She gets a partial pass, because sticking up for you while she's in the middle of arguing with you is hard.", "Im not sure there is totally enough info to fully judge everything. In terms of your specific headline question NTA for taking your own property back which she snatched off you.\n\nDoes your wife understand you have anger isssues and specific coping mechanisms when getting overwhelmed? Id guess so, but from her not stepping in to tell her sister to let you go im not so sure. I dont think you are wrong to walk away. Even for someone without anger problems, sometimes taking a break to calm down and then come back in a more rational mood is a good plan", "NTA and honestly just from your title not the answer I was expecting to give. Sir you need to think long and hard about this. I don\u2019t wanna go the nuclear route but I immediately thought they were trying to get you to do something stupid to get you arrested. There\u2019s no reason your wife should have even began to allow her sister to attempt to set you off. \n\nPlease be careful and remember this just in case. I don\u2019t wanna see you get arrested and lose your entire life while your wife skips away\u2026and yes I do understand that\u2019s extreme, but her loving you and allowing that is too.", "NTA.

PERIOD.  \n\n\nYou tried to resolve this issue, several times and in a reasonable manner until you were pushed to physically take your property back and escape from their attempt to hold you hostage to their insistence that you sit and take their nagging arguing behavior.  \n\n\nYour past anger issues aren't really relevant in this case and even so, you did well in sticking to your tricks that work.  Taking back your own property is not anger.", "Exactly *why* is your SIL so involved in your marriage? My dude, you have a wife problem. NTA.", "NTA.  People who are actually afraid of someone don't block their exit or take something from them.  Trust me on that.  They are using your anger issue to get the upper hand in your argument or to justify their actions.\n\nYou may have an anger problem, but you have a pretty big wife problem that is poking at the anger problem.  Her sister should not be interfering or participating in your arguments.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s not fair or nice to be ganged up on in an argument.\n\nPreventing you from leaving is a crazy thing to do.\nIf a man was blocking a woman from leaving the house police would be called.", "NTA. Your wife's sister has no right to be in an argument between you and your wife. You need to set a hard boundary about that.

You remained calm enough to leave and use your coping strategies.", "I don\u2019t have enough information to draw an informed conclusion, but you should be able to step away from arguments.

In fact, no one should ever be involved in a married couple's business.  If someone inserted themselves into a convo or disagreement between me and my husband, I would tell them to mind their own business or I may even kick them out the house.  Also, your wife should not be locking you out of your own home.  If my husband ever purposefully locked me out of my house, I'm like 99% sure we would be divorcing.  It's that serious to me.  Idc how mad he is at me, never disrespect me in such a way.  She sounds like she could be abusive, however I don't know her you do so you can answer that for sure.  I strongly suggest marriage counseling.  If she won't go, there's your answer to how she values the marriage.  At least continue your individual therapy because people like that will try to get a reaction out of you, especially since they know about your anger issues.", "NTA how is it fine for her to snatch them from you, but scary if you snatch them back?", "Info. No where near enough to give an answer.", "NTA. There\u2019s nothing I hate more than women who talk and act big regressing to \u201cbeing scared of a big angry man\u201d that they know damn well won\u2019t physically hurt them. Give me a break.

Without knowing what the argument was about I can't say id it involved her legitimately or if it was something with urgency where walking away was also problematic.", "NTA - your wife is wrong and her sister should not be inserting herself into you and your wife's business. When the arguement started while her sister was there, your wife or you should have said \"we can discuss this later in private\" and your wife should backed you on this.

It sounded more like it was between you and your wife so I would have focused on having the conversation at a separate time when the sister wasn\u2019t there - nothing good comes about having a discussion that gets heated when there is a third party. It can lead to what I see happened here, you felt cornered, tried to deescalate by leaving to cool down, but then because of the third party things didn\u2019t quite go the way as planned. I\u2019d set down ground rules for the future personally. I\u2019d say mostly NTA because you did everything right but you would be if you didn\u2019t communicate better with your wife.", "NTA\n\n\nDon't stand in front of charging bears then be mad at the bear for scaring you.

Why were you fighting, and why would your wife bring in family? I don't need those answers, but the reasoning is important. Also: maybe it's important to revisit your coping strategies with your wife. After a while, I could see myself getting tired of someone walking away from me in the middle of an argument. Not an excuse, and I'd have words with any family member that tried to involve themselves, but just something to think about. \n\nNTA", "NTA.

Then she played the victim when you didn't acquiesce to her demands. That's just manipulative. Also, i carry headphones everywhere I  go too. Not for anger, but social anxiety, but still. I would be pissed if someone grabbed mine out of my hands. That's not cool.", "NTA. I used to HATE it when my husband would walk away from our arguments. It drove me absolutely insane. Then I got some counselling and realized how important walking away is. \n\nThe argument will still be there, but walking away gives you an opportunity to come back after a reflection and approach it with a different mindset. Anger problems or not, you have a RIGHT to walk away, but especially so if you struggle with managing your emotions when you get heightened.

Leaving is the only reasonable option, particularly if voices were raised. (If police in my area came to house because of raised voices, the man would likely be arrested. Particularly with your wife saying that she is \"scared\" of the way you are acting.) If your wife and SIL weren't willing to calm down, they were probably playing you. Taking a walk and listening to your calm-down playlist was the appropriate thing to do. Your wife and SIL seem like they wanted to push you to the point of your exploding -- a result that they would use to shame and control you. And when you insisted on leaving, what did your wife do when you came back. Locked you out? What did you do that this was an appropriate response? Nothing from what you described. Getting your ear buds back from your SIL who grabbed them from you seems justified to me. That your wife would suggest when she finally allowed you back in the house, that you \"scared her and her sister\" is another attempt at controlling you. BS.\n\nThat you've had some success in the past with a counselor, perhaps seeing a couples counselor with your wife would be helpful. It would have the added benefit of allowing a calm, 3-d party to help keep the conversation from escalating. (Also, there would be no SIL trying to throw lighter fluid on the situation.) If your wife refuses to go, counseling might still be helpful for you. If your wife refuses, I would wonder if that might be because she can't play/manipulate you when an experienced counselor is present.  \n\nWho does your SIL think she is intervening in an argument between you and your wife and then saying \"we needed to talk about this and that \\[you\\] can't just leave\"??! Was it really appropriate for her to even be part of this argument? Is she recently divorced?\n\nI get the feeling that you do not just start arguing with your wife. From your description, I would surmise that she is the one who starts raising her voice, trying to get you to do the same.

It's basically a form of anger management/CBT (cognitive behavioural therapy). One of the main \"stops\" they encourage when you're angry is taking a step back so you can calm down and turn those \"hard thoughts\" into \"cool thoughts.\" (Hard thoughts can be factual \"SIL is being an AH\" but they're not helpful). Our sessions are mostly separate (my son gets the kid version, I get the adult/parent version on how to model and implement SNAP at home), but they hold the same core elements. You were trying to use SNAP, but they tried to corner you. \n\nWe're told to never physically remove something from our kid(s). If they choose not to listen (ex. Playing on their devices), you wait them out. The consequences aren't going anywhere. Batteries will die. They'll eventually have to come around, and they don't get to do anything else until the consequences are answered, too. (Like for my son, if he wants to play with his friend across the street, and he hasn't been... nice for lack of a better word, I'll tell him, \"You can go after you complete [work chore/time out],\" though i dont call it a time out. He's too old for that. I refer to it as a reflection time,  and when he's done thinking, we can talk about what both of us can do better to avoid conflict).\n\nShe violated the non-aggression principle by trying to cage you in, ON TOP of physically taking your personal property out of your hands.

No way I\u2019d allow my family to keep pushing him like that. He escapes to blow off steam, he never takes it out on me.
