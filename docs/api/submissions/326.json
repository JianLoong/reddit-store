This coming January, I am moving up to the city where she goes to university as I'm going to attend there in the fall of 2023. I'm currently apartment hunting and have found a couple places I really like. I recently had a conversation with my girlfriend explaining that I was excited to move up the this city and that I'd already been stocking up on decorations and furniture for our place of living. She responded back telling me not to buy furniture because her parents would be providing furniture for us when I move up. Now this is an incredibly sweet gesture, I genuinely would appreciate something like this a whole lot, however, I don't feel comfortable living in a space that is filled with furniture from her parents that I haven't bern able to pick out. This will be my first time moving away from home and I was incredibly excited to design a space for myself and my girlfriend, and the fact that our home might now be filled with furniture I don't really enjoy when I could have easily found some stuff I do enjoy and bought it irks me. I also feel that taking whatever amount of furniture that they are giving us would mean that I owe them down the line, which logically I know is not true, but that feeling is still there. I want to feel like I can do this independently, and while I appreciate the gesture GREATLY, I don't feel comfortable with the idea that her parents are going to furnish our entire house with furniture they've apparently been 'saving for this occasion.' My girlfriend says that it is stupid to not accept what is basically free furniture from her parents and that the furniture would go to waste if we don't take it. Her parents could very easily sell it if we didn't decide to take it and then they'd at least make some profit off of it instead of just giving it away. So, am I the asshole for *possibly* not accepting their offer to furnish our first home?\n\nEDIT 1: Hey ya'll! Thank you for your replies, I wanted to clear up a couple things. I am not completely against taking some of their furniture, my girlfriend had just said they'd be fully furnishing our first house and that scared me quite a bit. We talked about it a little more and she explained that she didn't mean that literally. Secondly- I love my girlfriend's parents. They have been nothing but kind to me and are amazing AMAZING people. Which is part of the reason I would feel really really awful if they gave me furniture and then I sold it or just overall was unhappy with it. We 100% will be going to look at all our options beforehand and I am so so grateful to these people for even offering. The idea of them furnishing our whole house was what was freaking me out.", "created_utc": 1667244869, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yimcz3/aita_for_possibly_not_accepting_furniture_my/", "score": 5, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Part of growing up and moving out on your own is hand me down furniture.", "NAH, but you should at least look at the furniture before turning it down. It's silly to refuse free furniture when you're just starting out on your own just on principles of wanting to pick it out yourself. Maybe all their furniture is awesome and you'll love it. Also don't assume anyone is going to be upset with you for not taking the furniture if you don't like it. Just politely turn it down, it's not a big deal.", "I think NTA, but with some provisions, if you feel that strongly about it, and it would bother you, then it's understandable, and hopefully they can understand that. I would say that it might be worth getting involved, see what they want to give you, and see if they have things that you would want to get. Personally I would take the free furniture, but if it's important to you, then you wouldn't really be the AH", "nta but why not try and arrange a time for you to go through their furniture to see if there is anything you like so you could just take that instead of all of it.", "NTA\n\nYou can say \"no\"\n\nOr you can do what my husband and I did years ago and \"accidentally\" drop the furniture down a flight of stairs", "NAH Just understand that giving furniture is not an attack on your autonomy and you won't owe them.

I got hand-me-downs when I got my house, and I refinished/painted/customized it over time. If there are no strings attached, consider accepting some and donating the rest.", "NTA for wanting to create your own space, but you could always replace pieces as you find what you love, and sell the ones you like less as you go. No need to make this an issue as long as Gf isn't going to start treating it like a bunch of family heirlooms.", "INFO: Most 20-year-old university students don't have the money to furnish an entire apartment with all newly purchased furniture. Can you really afford to do that? You have an emergency reserve fund, you have a budget, you know what your income and expenses are going to be, you're not going into an debt to buy all this furniture? Maybe you're a trust-fund baby and you really do have the money to do that. If so, awesome!\n\nBut there's nothing wrong with hand-me-down or second-hand furniture from other people. Heck, I'm 60 and I drive an $85k car that I bought for cash, and I *still* have some hand-me-down furniture, including a loveseat that my own daughter gave me when she bought a new one.", "Take the free furniture.  You can use slipcovers or something if its horrid. Save your cash.\n\nYou can buy 1 thing new to make you feel more comfortable as a compromise splurge. Whether its a bed, dresser, a cool desk or a painting.  1 nice new buy yourself is better than a whole apartment with all thriftstore pieces.\n\nThe rest of the cash stick in a cd or savings towards a huge future life thing later. It can become house fund, new car purchase, or dream vacation.  \n\nBe grateful you have a nice girlfriend with a thoughtful family. Don't  overthink it.", "NTA. My first place was nothing but furniture given to me and I was glad to have it. I was able to furnish it a little at a time. Take what furniture you can use. Unless you have a bunch of money you have to spend. Good furniture is expensive and a hassle to get it home.", "Nta, it\u2019s ur space and u shud be able to decorate it how u like if u can afford it and not in need of freebies but it wud be polite to accept at least a few things OR accept all of them while u look for furniture urself and save up then slowly switch them when u can get what u want maybe, then u can say u no longer need the old ones cuz I\u2019ve found the perfect replacement", "Truth.  YTA\n\nETA:  You don't have to keep it.  You start out with it and then replace it with the stuff you want when you find it (and have extra money for it).", "They really are the best. Her parents have been nothing but kind to me which is amazing and I appreciate it so so much because my own parents are...not great people.", "Hi! I am definitely not a trust fund baby- I've been saving up for stuff like this for quite a while now and that is why I have enough money to do things like this. All of the furniture I'd be buying would also be second hand- it's more the idea of not having any control over what is going into my space, see the update for more info :)! Thank you for your response!", "I had those exact feeling at your age. I took the help of my gf mom and it put me in a position later in life to help others. It's like a cycle of helping others, not a transaction. That's why I was insisting on the fact that you don't owe them.", "Then NTA. \n\nAs long as you can afford it, there's absolutely nothing wrong with preferring to pick out your own stuff.\n\nIt sounds like you & your girlfriend will be living together. I hope she gets some say in choosing furniture too!", "Oh she 100% will! Thanks again for your input!! :)"]}
