Improved relationship with my son and and his wife\n2. Switched therapists.\n3. Started treatment for my anxiety and depression\n4. Lost my father\n\nThings started to turn around when I decided to change therapists and went on a few sessions with the new one. Their approach allowed me to come to terms with the fact that my son's values, perspective on the world, and life objectives will never align with mine - and that's OK. It was a tough realization, but an important one.\n\nDuring therapy, I also discovered that my anxiety was (way) more off than I thought, and I never treated it. I started taking medication. After a few months, I was feeling a lot better about my son living away from me. Moreover, my therapist helped me understand a crucial aspect of my life: I had been living under the weight of guilt, giving up on so many plans for the sake of my own parents.\n\nA silly example? When my husband and I got married, I wanted to get a cat, but my father always HATED cats. I thought to myself, *\"My father despises felines... it wouldn't be fair to him to have a cat in our home, what if they come to visit? I wouldn't be a good daughter\"*. When I recounted this story to my therapist, they were shocked on how normal I thought that was. This was just one of many instances where guilt dictated my decisions. Both of my parents were masters at instilling guilt, and I had internalized it over the years.\n\nMain point of the original post: I wanted my son to continue living close to me, he didn't. In my misguided attempts to enforce my desires, I resorted to guilt-tripping him repeatedly (it's how I've been taught, it's what I knew). I now see how wrong and unhealthy that behavior is.\n\nWhile I may never fully understand or relate to the idea of living far away from family (STILL HURTS), I've come to accept that this is my issue to grapple with, not my son's burden. I am determined to confront this challenge alone and refuse to allow it to dictate my happiness.\n\nAfter my father passed - it happened suddenly - my son wanted to come to his funeral, but it would be so exhausting for him, not to mention expensive. So I told him there was no need to come, he could stay and we would get together and remember grandpa another time. I was surprised with myself, in other times I would have guilted him into coming as fast as he could.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to thank those who were respectful for the wake-up call and the discussions that unfolded from my initial post. It has been an enlightening journey of self-discovery and growth. I'm committed to continuing my progress and learning how to prioritize my own well-being while respecting the autonomy and choices of those around me.", "created_utc": 1689346449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14zikci/update_aita_for_wanting_my_son_to_move_back/", "score": 104, "replies": ["OP I\u2019m so glad that you were able to see that you weren\u2019t getting the help you needed from your therapist and found a different one. You weren\u2019t just dealing with cultural, but generational differences and that\u2019s not an easy bridge to gap on your own.\n\nI\u2019m sorry for your loss and hope that you and your family are doing well.", "Get yourself a cat, mama. They're healing :)", "Glad you're feeling better! \n\nI feel like people were a bit unfair to you in your last post. You've done the work for yourself which is amazing, but the things you said about how important culture is are true. I hope you know that it's fine to share your resources (emotional and otherwise) with people who give back to you. Your son has pulled away, you don't owe him everything like you may have thought before. I come from an individualistic culture too and distance has consequences. He's already seen that with your recent loss.\n\nYou've shown a lot of grace and growth. All the best to you!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Both of my parents were masters at instilling guilt, and I had internalized it over the years.\n\nI don't think this is that wrong, on the face of it? Don't get me wrong, you shouldn't let that prevent you from getting a cat. My dad is allergic to cats, but that didn't stop me from getting one. It just means that my dad can't stay for too long or his allergies start getting bad. \n\nBut considering who's gonna be in your house and around the pet, even if only on occasion, before getting one is the right thing to do.\n\nOh but also you should not let that worry over not being a good daughter part happen, that's probably more of what the therapist was shocked at hah", "Thanks for the update! Glad you seem to be on the mend emotionally. It take a big person to own up to their mistakes, and I hope your relationship with your sin continues to improve. The one thing that cuts / heals is that what you have gone through with your son (as tough emotionally as it has been for you) is to break generational trauma. Your parents did it to you (as theirs surely did to them) but you raised a son who broke free... and hopefully won't have to go through the same with his kids. So you get some credit for raising him right..... Even tho it sucked at the time \n\nPS my cats name is Knives", "Wow, that is so much growth! Congratulations on doing that very hard work in therapy. I'm proud of you!\n\nI do hope you and your son are able to build a relationship that meets everybody's needs.\n\nBest of luck, and thank you for the update.", "good im glad you finally respect your son. hopefully you continue on your journey", "What a heartwarming update. I\u2019m so glad you\u2019re able to be okay with your son\u2019s choices, I hope you continue to feel better and better. And post cat pics when you find the right kitty \u2764\ufe0f", "1. Sorry for your loss\n2. It's great that you have started these changes in your life.\n3. You should get that cat!", "Sorry for your loss, but so happy to see your emotional growth! \n\nAnd let me also chime in: go get a cat!", "Cats are so great for the soul (and blood pressure)! It's definitely something to consider!\n\nThat being said, it sounds like you have done a lot of hard work on yourself and leaned into therapy! Your new therapist sounds like great fit as you are seeing results! Amazing!\n\nI wish you more breakthrough moments in therapy and maybe even a furry feline companion as you heal yourself and your relationship with your son!", "I think it is great you got help and can evaluate yourself better now.\n\nCats are great support animals ;) or they can be. Mine is currently lying one armchair away from me and is happy excepting any pettings coming his way.\n\nGood luck with your son, I think your new attitude may well improve your relationship with him in the future!", "My mum needs to see your therapist", "Hey it\u2019s time for you to get a cat, friend. Do something exciting for yourself and get that cat you always wanted!!! It will *really* help with your anxiety, and they\u2019re scot and cuddly!", "So... i'm sorry for your loss.\n\nAwesome update! Have you thought of getting a cat now?", "Will you get a cat?", "You totally need to get a cat!!!", "I'm glad to hear that you are doing better and your relationship with your son is better.\n\nDon't apologize for your culture. I'm American, but I lived in a very collectivist country for many years. The US is the most individualistic society in the world and we are raised to believe that we are the best at everything and that everyone is jealous of us. It blinds us to other ways of doing things.", "Get a cat now!", "Get two cats. Just in case one is a bit of a dick. \n\nI grew up with a cat always in the house, first thing that happened when I moved out of my mums house was get a cat. My partner and I have one each now. Wouldn't live without one, it just wouldn\u2019t feel like home. \n\nAlso get a boy cat, they can get super affectionate towards their human.", "Ragdolls are good for your mental health", "You mean right meow right?", "Can confirm"]}
