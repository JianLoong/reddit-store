Improved relationship with my son and and his wife\n2. Switched therapists.\n3. Started treatment for my anxiety and depression\n4. Lost my father\n\nThings started to turn around when I decided to change therapists and went on a few sessions with the new one. Their approach allowed me to come to terms with the fact that my son's values, perspective on the world, and life objectives will never align with mine - and that's OK. It was a tough realization, but an important one.\n\nDuring therapy, I also discovered that my anxiety was (way) more off than I thought, and I never treated it. I started taking medication. After a few months, I was feeling a lot better about my son living away from me. Moreover, my therapist helped me understand a crucial aspect of my life: I had been living under the weight of guilt, giving up on so many plans for the sake of my own parents.\n\nA silly example? When my husband and I got married, I wanted to get a cat, but my father always HATED cats. I thought to myself, *\"My father despises felines... it wouldn't be fair to him to have a cat in our home, what if they come to visit? I wouldn't be a good daughter\"*. When I recounted this story to my therapist, they were shocked on how normal I thought that was. This was just one of many instances where guilt dictated my decisions. Both of my parents were masters at instilling guilt, and I had internalized it over the years.\n\nMain point of the original post: I wanted my son to continue living close to me, he didn't. In my misguided attempts to enforce my desires, I resorted to guilt-tripping him repeatedly (it's how I've been taught, it's what I knew). I now see how wrong and unhealthy that behavior is.\n\nWhile I may never fully understand or relate to the idea of living far away from family (STILL HURTS), I've come to accept that this is my issue to grapple with, not my son's burden. I am determined to confront this challenge alone and refuse to allow it to dictate my happiness.\n\nAfter my father passed - it happened suddenly - my son wanted to come to his funeral, but it would be so exhausting for him, not to mention expensive. So I told him there was no need to come, he could stay and we would get together and remember grandpa another time. I was surprised with myself, in other times I would have guilted him into coming as fast as he could.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to thank those who were respectful for the wake-up call and the discussions that unfolded from my initial post.

Glad you seem to be on the mend emotionally. It take a big person to own up to their mistakes, and I hope your relationship with your son continues to improve. The one thing that cuts / heals is that what you have gone through with your son (as tough emotionally as it has been for you) is to break generational trauma. Your parents did it to you (as theirs surely did to them) but you raised a son who broke free... and hopefully won't have to go through the same with his kids.

He has thanked me a few times for bringing the love of animals into his life.

Your progress is impressive and I hope you are proud of yourself!\n\nI haven\u2019t gone through all the comments, and I imagine someone has already said it\u2026 But likely a huge factor of him moving away was because of your guilt tripping tendencies. I wholly understand you were doing only what you knew, that your own parents manipulated you the same way and then that\u2019s also what you exhibited\u2026 It\u2019s hard to know how to do things differently when you haven\u2019t been taught any other way. And culturally, even here in the US, women/girls are expected to be a certain level of more submissive than men/boys. It\u2019s very subversive and ingrained, it feels \u201cnormal\u201d because that\u2019s all people experience growing up sometimes. It takes a certain type of personality to see that this dynamic is overall co-dependent and so unhealthy for everyone. Going against the grain of not just culture but losing your family in the process is extremely hard and painful! But the pros outweigh the cons for those like him. \u201cRespect your elders even when they\u2019re wrong,\u201d is an old mentality that should have died a long time ago. I am definitely not trying to make you feel bad, but I don\u2019t know how else to succinctly put it, but\u2026 How you were likely contributed a great deal to pushing him away. I know you feel abandoned by him\u2026 but he likely felt abandoned by you a long, long, long time ago.\n\nThat being said, I really do commend you for coming as far as you have! My experience with elders is that they typically prefer to keep their head in the ground, like an ostrich, rather than pull their head out and try to see things differently. I feel it happens so infrequently, that those who do manage it should be admired and applauded! So big kudos to you!", "That's a really great update, glad you are doing so well on this journey of yours", "Chiming in on the \u201cGet a cat\u201d.

Your son is lucky to have a mom who can continue to grow and be a role model for positive change.", "What a wonderful update! I understand how hard it can be to break this cycle, especially when you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re in it. I lived my life solely for what my parents wanted and expected of me until I was 22. Had a wake up call and ended up putting an entire country between us (moved from West Coast USA to East) in order to feel free enough to live for myself. I\u2019m very happy I did; I am so much healthier now than then. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, I would talk to your son and admit you screwed up with the guilt. Apologize and explain that you are getting therapy and treatment (I\u2019m sure he knows) and that you\u2019re going to try to do better. Maybe even ask that he say something if you backslide and he feels guilted. It\u2019s a hard habit to break! My own mom struggles at times to not go back to the bad habits from our past and I kindly but firmly tell her when it isn\u2019t okay. \n\nTaking ownership for what she did is the only reason I have a relationship with my mom.

And I hope you get your cat now!", "I'm so glad that the therapy is helping.", "Get a dog.", "My MIL needs to see your therapist- I love her and obviously my husband loves her, but he started to recognize that half the time when he talks to her, he gets off the phone feeling worse than he had before speaking to her. He has to take breaks from seeing her/speaking with her so that he's rejuvenated enough the next time he does see her. I can't fathom that; my parents are wonderful and so easy to hang out with... but here we are. It's just sad because I know it hurts her that all her kids regularly either get upset with her or don't see her as much as they could, but she makes it worse and exacerbates the situation by guilting them or crying about it to other siblings. Unfortunately she's told us she's not interested in therapy, so we'll just keep up a slightly arm's length distance relationship where she gets to see us and her grandkids... but not as much as she could, because it's too hard on my husband. I'm glad to read this update and see your changes though, it gives me hope that there's still time. Go get that cat!", "I would highly recommend checking out the 12-step group; Adult Children of Alcoholics. They are considering a name change for the group to \"adult children of dysfunctional families\", because many of the people in the organization don't have alcoholism in their family. What are you are describing is the kind of thing that I hear at every meeting. I think you would find it to be quite transformational, in addition to your therapy. I know of a great zoom meeting. DM me if you are interested in checking it out.", "Wonderful that you realized that the only person you can truly change is yourself. I'm glad you have taken steps to be happier and more at peace.\n\nI agree with others, GET A CAT!!

First off, I hope you reread everything you wrote and recognize how much hard work you have put in. Not just on how to have a better relationship with your son, but a better one with yourself. You took a huge step towards healing yourself, healing your inner child. You took a step back in order to find a new perspective and you found one! \n\nYour first post was riddled with so much severe anxiety, I\u2019m honestly a bit surprised you got to the point where you were able to give us this update. I\u2019m proud of you. I hope that doesn\u2019t come across condescending, but I really am so proud of you. My own parents have done some wild things and a lot of it was/is driven by severe anxiety and control issues. I hope one day they are able to see things from a new perspective, like you have been able to do, and put in their own work. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud, I know how hard that must have been. Hell, I have my own severe anxiety issues and know how hard it can be to fight through that feeling and not let it control your actions/choices. It\u2019s hard, for me it can feel like this tight spot in my chest that is expanding more and more, feeling like it\u2019s going to explode if I don\u2019t find a way to relieve it.\n\nGo get your cat or cats, like others said, they really are therapeutic and it\u2019s time you gave your inner child something she wanted. When you get a cat or cats though, I fully expect the cat tax to be paid please and thank you.", "If being close to family was so important for you, did you ever think about moving to your son's new country?", "This post gives me a bunch of happiness and faith in the world :)", "Time for the cat distribution system to work its magic", "Pleeease get a cat!", "This is pretty amazing - so glad that you found the courage to be honest with yourself and make the effort for change.

Props to your son for taking the initiative to break the cycle but props to you too for looking past your behaviours and starting therapy.

Please get a cat!", "I'm glad you're getting help because reading the original posts with the updates was...concerning.", "Or do cat fostering.  You get to see LOTS of cats, have fun with kittens (before they turn in to terrorists, lol), and if you find one you can\u2019t live without, you adopt it.  Kind of a \u2018try before you buy\u2019 program.  And op would be helping kitties who desperately need it.", "This. I love my babies. We have 3 cats, one for each person.

Luckily,  my kids (who I do listen to - they're awesome) kinda set me straight one night after a manipulative comment I made. \n\nIt's hard to grow past the emotional trauma of guilt inflicted by my own parents. Sometimes I'll be out randomly doing something and I'm just struck by overwhelming guilt that I've fucked something up.  And I have to talk myself out of it. It's nuts.", "agree with you.", "Agreed. He can make his own choices but they do have consequences.", "The part that was abnormal was the extent to which her parents *opinions* and guilting controlled her private life.

Lol my Ragdoll is so sweet, but my other cat can be a bit of a dick.\n\nI\u2019m gonna put in a vote for OP to get a rag doll cat or a long haired russian blue. Those are the two sweetest breeds I\u2019ve ever encountered. My cat Luna is a rag doll and the name of the breed is perfect. They are so sweet and docile, very loving and affectionate. The only scratches I\u2019ve ever gotten from Luna are because she isn\u2019t declawed and will use her paw to reach for my hand to pet her. She has literally never tried to swipe at me in a malicious way. My cat Pippin is a short hair grey cat, not sure of her specific breed. Typically female grey cats can be more aggressive, and Pippin is definitely a little mean girl, but also so loving. She just gets mad if you stop petting her and keeps the dog (American bulldog/Pitbull mix) in line (he won\u2019t walk past her if she\u2019s in a mood cause she might chase him \ud83d\ude02).", "I agree.

The dick cat is very affectionate when he wants to be, headbutts until he gets pets, but it's on his terms and for the length of time he chooses before he gets over stimulated. He's not the type of cat you can absent-mindedly pet while doing something else. You gotta pay attention and watch for the signs; the ears, the tail, his body language. The other cat however is game whenever, wherever, FOREVER. Once you start petting her and showing her attention, good luck getting anything else done. \ud83d\ude02\n\nEdit: when I went away for a week I ended up having to carry her on my hip like a toddler while I did household chores because she was less than pleased that I left and had friends come by for food and cuddles. \ud83d\ude02 She's not a small cat either, at 30lbs she IS a toddler!", "I find most cats can be a bit dickish at times, but they can also be loving and fun companions.
