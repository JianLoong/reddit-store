Improved relationship with my son and and his wife\n2. Switched therapists.\n3. Started treatment for my anxiety and depression\n4. Lost my father\n\nThings started to turn around when I decided to change therapists and went on a few sessions with the new one. Their approach allowed me to come to terms with the fact that my son's values, perspective on the world, and life objectives will never align with mine - and that's OK. It was a tough realization, but an important one.\n\nDuring therapy, I also discovered that my anxiety was (way) more off than I thought, and I never treated it. I started taking medication. After a few months, I was feeling a lot better about my son living away from me. Moreover, my therapist helped me understand a crucial aspect of my life: I had been living under the weight of guilt, giving up on so many plans for the sake of my own parents.\n\nA silly example? When my husband and I got married, I wanted to get a cat, but my father always HATED cats. I thought to myself, *\"My father despises felines... it wouldn't be fair to him to have a cat in our home, what if they come to visit? I wouldn't be a good daughter\"*. When I recounted this story to my therapist, they were shocked on how normal I thought that was. This was just one of many instances where guilt dictated my decisions. Both of my parents were masters at instilling guilt, and I had internalized it over the years.\n\nMain point of the original post: I wanted my son to continue living close to me, he didn't. In my misguided attempts to enforce my desires, I resorted to guilt-tripping him repeatedly (it's how I've been taught, it's what I knew). I now see how wrong and unhealthy that behavior is.\n\nWhile I may never fully understand or relate to the idea of living far away from family (STILL HURTS), I've come to accept that this is my issue to grapple with, not my son's burden. I am determined to confront this challenge alone and refuse to allow it to dictate my happiness.\n\nAfter my father passed - it happened suddenly - my son wanted to come to his funeral, but it would be so exhausting for him, not to mention expensive. So I told him there was no need to come, he could stay and we would get together and remember grandpa another time. I was surprised with myself, in other times I would have guilted him into coming as fast as he could.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to thank those who were respectful for the wake-up call and the discussions that unfolded from my initial post. It has been an enlightening journey of self-discovery and growth. I'm committed to continuing my progress and learning how to prioritize my own well-being while respecting the autonomy and choices of those around me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you everyone for this awesome reception of my post, I wasn't expecting this much love.

Glad you seem to be on the mend emotionally. It take a big person to own up to their mistakes, and I hope your relationship with your son continues to improve. The one thing that cuts / heals is that what you have gone through with your son (as tough emotionally as it has been for you) is to break generational trauma. Your parents did it to you (as theirs surely did to them) but you raised a son who broke free... and hopefully won't have to go through the same with his kids.

In this case I'm not referring to the situation with your son, but to the one with your father and cats. When I started dating my boyfriend, he had only had bad experiences with dogs and therefore didn't like them. Now, the dog I adopted prior to the relationship is his pride and joy. He has thanked me a few times for bringing the love of animals into his life. The changes your fresh perspective can bring to the existing systems aren't always bad, contrary to the beliefs of people like your father.

Your progress is impressive and I hope you are proud of yourself!\n\nI haven\u2019t gone through all the comments, and I imagine someone has already said it\u2026 But likely a huge factor of him moving away was because of your guilt tripping tendencies. I wholly understand you were doing only what you knew, that your own parents manipulated you the same way and then that\u2019s also what you exhibited\u2026 It\u2019s hard to know how to do things differently when you haven\u2019t been taught any other way. And culturally, even here in the US, women/girls are expected to be a certain level of more submissive than men/boys. It\u2019s very subversive and ingrained, it feels \u201cnormal\u201d because that\u2019s all people experience growing up sometimes. It takes a certain type of personality to see that this dynamic is overall co-dependent and so unhealthy for everyone. Going against the grain of not just culture but losing your family in the process is extremely hard and painful! But the pros outweigh the cons for those like him. \u201cRespect your elders even when they\u2019re wrong,\u201d is an old mentality that should have died a long time ago. I am definitely not trying to make you feel bad, but I don\u2019t know how else to succinctly put it, but\u2026 How you were likely contributed a great deal to pushing him away. I know you feel abandoned by him\u2026 but he likely felt abandoned by you a long, long, long time ago.\n\nThat being said, I really do commend you for coming as far as you have! My experience with elders is that they typically prefer to keep their head in the ground, like an ostrich, rather than pull their head out and try to see things differently. I feel it happens so infrequently, that those who do manage it should be admired and applauded! So big kudos to you!", "That's a really great update, glad you are doing so well on this journey of yours", "Chiming in on the \u201cGet a cat\u201d.

I understand how hard it can be to break this cycle, especially when you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re in it. I lived my life solely for what my parents wanted and expected of me until I was 22. Had a wake up call and ended up putting an entire country between us (moved from West Coast USA to East) in order to feel free enough to live for myself. I\u2019m very happy I did; I am so much healthier now than then. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, I would talk to your son and admit you screwed up with the guilt. Apologize and explain that you are getting therapy and treatment (I\u2019m sure he knows) and that you\u2019re going to try to do better. Maybe even ask that he say something if you backslide and he feels guilted. It\u2019s a hard habit to break! My own mom struggles at times to not go back to the bad habits from our past and I kindly but firmly tell her when it isn\u2019t okay. \n\nTaking ownership for what she did is the only reason I have a relationship with my mom.

He has to take breaks from seeing her/speaking with her so that he's rejuvenated enough the next time he does see her. I can't fathom that; my parents are wonderful and so easy to hang out with... but here we are. It's just sad because I know it hurts her that all her kids regularly either get upset with her or don't see her as much as they could, but she makes it worse and exacerbates the situation by guilting them or crying about it to other siblings. Unfortunately she's told us she's not interested in therapy, so we'll just keep up a slightly arm's length distance relationship where she gets to see us and her grandkids... but not as much as she could, because it's too hard on my husband.

You took a step back in order to find a new perspective and you found one! \n\nYour first post was riddled with so much severe anxiety, I\u2019m honestly a bit surprised you got to the point where you were able to give us this update. I\u2019m proud of you. I hope that doesn\u2019t come across condescending, but I really am so proud of you. My own parents have done some wild things and a lot of it was/is driven by severe anxiety and control issues.

Hell, I have my own severe anxiety issues and know how hard it can be to fight through that feeling and not let it control your actions/choices.

I was able to ask her to recognize the similarities and the way they can and have made it hard to be close and communicate.

I was born and raised (and still live) in the US, same for my parents. Both of them were what we call \"helicopter\" parents; they were always hovering around me growing up. I was their entire world. I wasn't allowed to think for myself, my thoughts and opinions had to be identical to theirs. I rarely was ever allowed to leave the house to be with friends; and my friends were the trusting nerdy good kids of my class. They tried to teach me to be dependent on them for EVERYTHING: finances, bill paying, anything involving insurance, anything involving vehicles, cooking; they taught me nothing in regards to how to survive on my own. When I graduated college, they expected me to live in their house or very close by. They only wanted me to be employed to have something to do, not to earn money because they would take care of that. They kept insisting that I would have kids one day, but did not ever want me to be in a relationship. When I finally had enough money to move out a year after college (and with the mental help of my therapist to give me the courage to do so), I moved to a completely different part of the country. They tried to enforce rules on me, I told them no. I was able to be gainfully employed and find a home without needing to ask them for money; I did it all on my own. I taught myself how to be an adult, and I am still going strong. The first few years I was gone, they would guilt trip me every so often, even vaguely hint that I was eventually going to fail and would have to ask for their help at some point, possibly even move back \"home\". Nope. They calmed down a little when my dad was diagnosed with ALS; he died months later. This was 2012. My mom and I spoke slightly more often because of his death; she even came up to see me for Christmas that year. She made snide remarks about how surprised she was that my apartment wasn't a shit hole, that I had such a well paying job, that my bank account wasn't anywhere close to negative, and that my cats were going to be her grandchildren. A year later (2013), she made a desperate attempt to control me by telling me that I didn't know how to be in love, or love people in general, I only knew how to be obsessed with them. For the first time in my life, I demanded an apology from her. She kept trying to say \"Forgot it, we're talking about something else\" like she always did when I called her out on things like that. I wouldn't drop it, I continued to demand an apology. She hung up on me. That was our last ever phone conversation. I called her twice, she never answered. The second time, I left a voicemail, which was the last time she heard my voice. I told her what she said was untrue, she knew that, and it was hurtful that she believed such a thing about me. I was not speaking to her again until she apologized. Very long story short, she never did. And I refused to speak to her. She tried countless times to talk to me and act like nothing happened (something she did my whole life) regardless that I told her every single time that I needed space and not to contact me. She disowned me twice, claimed I was abusing her, and that she was writing me out of her will. I told her to go see a therapist like I had been doing since I moved out of the house. She never did. She told my family that she and I were fine, and that we talked all the time. She only complained to my uncle about everything, relayed to him what I had said; he agreed with me, especially on her getting therapy. She never admitted fault for that day, or for anything that she did to me during my childhood, which through therapy I realized was mental, emotional, verbal,and a little bit of physical abuse. She died in November 2021; I have been ecstatically happy ever since. I have felt no remorse, sadness, grief. Just pure bliss and relief. \nNaturally, my vote for your original post was YTA.\n\nAfter reading your update....I was very surprised and relieved. You did what both my parents refused to do, and that was to see someone and get help. Both of them came from childhoods that involved their mothers being physically, verbally, mentally, and emotionally abusive to them; their mothers also refused to let go once they became adults. They both suffered from depression, anxiety, PTSD but never owned up to that. They just decided to be the same as their mothers but not entirely. I had accused them of being abusive all my years under their roof, and they denied it because they never beat me; they didn't view anything that wasn't physically as abusive. YOU realized that you developed some terrible habits from your parents, you worked and are working to remedy them. YOU realized that what you were doing to your son was wrong, and you are going through the steps to fix it by accepting his decisions. YOU are doing what so many of us wish our abusive parents would have done/could do, and I want to say thank you.\nThank you for showing that there are abusive parents that are able to see their mistakes, own up to them, and work to fix them. The best of luck on your journey", "Wow, you have done a great job! You're going to be a lot happier now, I think. You will be able to fully enjoy your life even without your son being nearby, but you would have found it much more difficult before. You'll also have a much better relationship with your son.\n\nMake sure to share photos of your cat once you adopt it! :)", "I remember your original post, and I found your update very moving. Thank you so much for coming back and letting us know how you're getting on.\n\nFirst, I'm so sorry that you've lost your father. I hope you have been able to remember him with joy, even if you have begun to re-evaluate some aspects of how you shaped your life around him.\n\nSecond, I'm so glad that you've been pursuing treatment for anxiety. I started taking anxiety medication a few years ago, and it made such a difference to how I respond to challenges, and to how I think about myself. It hasn't solved everything, but it helps me to recognise and take a breath when my thinking is heading down a self-defeating and unhealthy spiral. It's like the competing voices in my head are just a bit quieter, so I can think more clearly over the top of them.\n\nThird, I'm glad you've found some peace with your son and his decisions about his life. I'm sure you'll be closer for it. I know my own mum would love it if I lived closer to her, but she is also so proud of my achievements - and I see it as a symbol of what a brilliant job she did that I am so happy and confident where I need to be.\n\nFinally, do get a cat! You won't regret it! My mum swears by Jackson Galaxy.", "Piling on to say, you\u2019re a WONDERFUL PERSON. Such growth and maturity. You\u2019re going to make a great rescue kitty mom!", "This was the sweetest update ever!  I am so happy for you that you've had these realizations and I'm excited for you to get your cat!  I can't imagine my life without my furry little friends and I hope yours brings you as much joy as mine have.  Good luck!", "Good for you on all of these positive changes! I do have a question if you're so inclined to answer. You say at the beginning that you improved your relationship with your son and his wife. Did you end up talking about everything and sharing how therapy has shown you that how you were raised influenced your treatment of him? If so, how did he respond? I'm just interested to hear how everything actually settled out with him and his wife after the whole initial argument that sparked your first post.", "Wonderful! \u2764\ufe0f", "So glad to hear you are happier!!", "Sounds like you are getting better.", "This is such a wonderful update--congratulations to you and many good wishes for your continuing healing.  It is really insane and interesting (in both good and bad ways) how we \"normalize\" and internalize certain behaviors/things that, if we heard an unknown third party talk about, would probably make us pause.\n\nRegarding your struggle with being at peace with your son choosing to live far from family--I think you two are just looking at--and defining--family closeness differently.  You just place more emphasis on physical proximity (and thus, more opportunities to physically be there/present) whereas your son places more emphasis on, perhaps being there for the big/important things physically but for smaller things, being there for support emotionally, etc.  It's not necessarily that your son is removed from you culturally or values-wise---it's that you two simply define the same \"thing\" differently.  Look at it this way: your son believes his relationship with you is strong enough to withstand the physical distance between you guys.\n\nAs for the cat-- I'm thrilled for you!  If you have the space available, you can try to create a catio for the cat to be able to spend some time outside--or maybe teach the cat to walk on a leash.  My friend has one cat who absolutely loves his leash because it means he gets to go outside and scare some squirrels.", "I can see so much emotional maturity in the tone of this post compared to the first one.

That people can change no matter what age you are or how much some behaviors have been instilled in you. A lot of older people I know in my life seem like the opposite. That they are too old and set in their ways, but look at you, you're doing it! I can't imagine how hard it is but you really seem like you're taking it seriously and changing for the better. \n\nI'm glad you've realized the guilt tripping you were doing to your son, it wasn't right but it was a learnt behavior from your own parents (usual how these things go too).

It was very brave of you to put your trust in a professional despite this being something you could get criticized for by family members.\n\nEverybody makes mistakes, everybody has trauma, and it's very mature of you to try and fix that instead of living in denial. Hope your journey is easy and smooth :)", "Condolences for your father.", "My parents, especially my dad, were very anti cat people. \n\nI moved out when I was 21 and on the way home from signing the mortgage paperwork stopped to pick up my very first kitten.\n\nStepping into my first place for the first time with my own cat was *everything*! \n\n_(Side note: my dad also had told me that morning before I left to go sign the paperwork to remember that I was still grounded for another week, no cats allowed and that he still makes the rules.

This sub is very annoying for being so US-centric, assuming everyone else is from the same place and/or never even acknowledging cultural differences play a role when giving opinions. I say this as someone from the US, same age as your son, who also moved away (not abroad but several hours by plane) from my parents who are immigrants and also expected me to stay close. They pressured me for years to move back and eventually I did, in large part because of them. But, I say it\u2019s fair you want your son close and it\u2019s hard for you to understand why he wouldn\u2019t, and it\u2019s also totally understandable he wants to live somewhere else. \n\nI would add though that you can still maintain a good relationship with him- while my parents regularly asked me to move back, they never said I was being an asshole.

That tells him that you are listening and want to do better.  Keep up with your therapy and you can also find hobbies that will keep you busy.\n\nYou are learning.

Kudos to you for not just switching therapists, but doing the work to identify the issues upon which you have to focus, and actually starting the change.

I am glad you are trying to break the pattern when it comes to yourself as the parent.\n\nI am terribly sorry for the loss of your father, but also happy for this new path upon which you are embarking.

It\u2019s taken several years, but she has begun to understand that we simply want/need different things in life, and even though I love her very much, I will never be moving home.
