Improved relationship with my son and and his wife\n2. Switched therapists.\n3. Started treatment for my anxiety and depression\n4. Lost my father\n\nThings started to turn around when I decided to change therapists and went on a few sessions with the new one. Their approach allowed me to come to terms with the fact that my son's values, perspective on the world, and life objectives will never align with mine - and that's OK. It was a tough realization, but an important one.\n\nDuring therapy, I also discovered that my anxiety was (way) more off than I thought, and I never treated it. I started taking medication. After a few months, I was feeling a lot better about my son living away from me. Moreover, my therapist helped me understand a crucial aspect of my life: I had been living under the weight of guilt, giving up on so many plans for the sake of my own parents.\n\nA silly example? When my husband and I got married, I wanted to get a cat, but my father always HATED cats. I thought to myself, *\"My father despises felines... it wouldn't be fair to him to have a cat in our home, what if they come to visit? I wouldn't be a good daughter\"*. When I recounted this story to my therapist, they were shocked on how normal I thought that was. This was just one of many instances where guilt dictated my decisions. Both of my parents were masters at instilling guilt, and I had internalized it over the years.\n\nMain point of the original post: I wanted my son to continue living close to me, he didn't. In my misguided attempts to enforce my desires, I resorted to guilt-tripping him repeatedly (it's how I've been taught, it's what I knew). I now see how wrong and unhealthy that behavior is.\n\nWhile I may never fully understand or relate to the idea of living far away from family (STILL HURTS), I've come to accept that this is my issue to grapple with, not my son's burden. I am determined to confront this challenge alone and refuse to allow it to dictate my happiness.\n\nAfter my father passed - it happened suddenly - my son wanted to come to his funeral, but it would be so exhausting for him, not to mention expensive. So I told him there was no need to come, he could stay and we would get together and remember grandpa another time. I was surprised with myself, in other times I would have guilted him into coming as fast as he could.\n\nIn conclusion, I want to thank those who were respectful for the wake-up call and the discussions that unfolded from my initial post. It has been an enlightening journey of self-discovery and growth. I'm committed to continuing my progress and learning how to prioritize my own well-being while respecting the autonomy and choices of those around me.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT:\n\nThank you everyone for this awesome reception of my post, I wasn't expecting this much love.

Glad you seem to be on the mend emotionally. It take a big person to own up to their mistakes, and I hope your relationship with your son continues to improve. The one thing that cuts / heals is that what you have gone through with your son (as tough emotionally as it has been for you) is to break generational trauma. Your parents did it to you (as theirs surely did to them) but you raised a son who broke free... and hopefully won't have to go through the same with his kids.

In this case I'm not referring to the situation with your son, but to the one with your father and cats. When I started dating my boyfriend, he had only had bad experiences with dogs and therefore didn't like them. Now, the dog I adopted prior to the relationship is his pride and joy. He has thanked me a few times for bringing the love of animals into his life. The changes your fresh perspective can bring to the existing systems aren't always bad, contrary to the beliefs of people like your father.

Your progress is impressive and I hope you are proud of yourself!\n\nI haven\u2019t gone through all the comments, and I imagine someone has already said it\u2026 But likely a huge factor of him moving away was because of your guilt tripping tendencies. I wholly understand you were doing only what you knew, that your own parents manipulated you the same way and then that\u2019s also what you exhibited\u2026 It\u2019s hard to know how to do things differently when you haven\u2019t been taught any other way. And culturally, even here in the US, women/girls are expected to be a certain level of more submissive than men/boys. It\u2019s very subversive and ingrained, it feels \u201cnormal\u201d because that\u2019s all people experience growing up sometimes. It takes a certain type of personality to see that this dynamic is overall co-dependent and so unhealthy for everyone. Going against the grain of not just culture but losing your family in the process is extremely hard and painful! But the pros outweigh the cons for those like him. \u201cRespect your elders even when they\u2019re wrong,\u201d is an old mentality that should have died a long time ago. I am definitely not trying to make you feel bad, but I don\u2019t know how else to succinctly put it, but\u2026 How you were likely contributed a great deal to pushing him away. I know you feel abandoned by him\u2026 but he likely felt abandoned by you a long, long, long time ago.\n\nThat being said, I really do commend you for coming as far as you have! My experience with elders is that they typically prefer to keep their head in the ground, like an ostrich, rather than pull their head out and try to see things differently. I feel it happens so infrequently, that those who do manage it should be admired and applauded! So big kudos to you!", "That's a really great update, glad you are doing so well on this journey of yours", "Chiming in on the \u201cGet a cat\u201d.

Your son is lucky to have a mom who can continue to grow and be a role model for positive change.", "What a wonderful update! I understand how hard it can be to break this cycle, especially when you don\u2019t realize you\u2019re in it. I lived my life solely for what my parents wanted and expected of me until I was 22. Had a wake up call and ended up putting an entire country between us (moved from West Coast USA to East) in order to feel free enough to live for myself. I\u2019m very happy I did; I am so much healthier now than then. \n\nIf you haven\u2019t already, I would talk to your son and admit you screwed up with the guilt. Apologize and explain that you are getting therapy and treatment (I\u2019m sure he knows) and that you\u2019re going to try to do better. Maybe even ask that he say something if you backslide and he feels guilted. It\u2019s a hard habit to break! My own mom struggles at times to not go back to the bad habits from our past and I kindly but firmly tell her when it isn\u2019t okay. \n\nTaking ownership for what she did is the only reason I have a relationship with my mom.

I can't fathom that; my parents are wonderful and so easy to hang out with... but here we are. It's just sad because I know it hurts her that all her kids regularly either get upset with her or don't see her as much as they could, but she makes it worse and exacerbates the situation by guilting them or crying about it to other siblings. Unfortunately she's told us she's not interested in therapy, so we'll just keep up a slightly arm's length distance relationship where she gets to see us and her grandkids... but not as much as she could, because it's too hard on my husband.
