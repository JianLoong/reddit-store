He failed.\n\nHe might secretly be glad that you stepped in and played \"bad guy,\" so he can blame YOU to his girlfriend.  When I had children at home, they would occasionally asked to be \"grounded  for the weekend.\"  This was when they were invited to a place or event they didn't want to go and it was more socially acceptable to tell their peers that \"mean mom grounded me,\" than admit they didn't want to go.\n\nI agree with restricting his activities after school.  If he is compliant and does what he's supposed to for a while, you might consider letting him go out on a Friday or Saturday.  If you do, set a curfew.\n\nIn spite of what your wife thinks, you are his father, not his friend.\n\nThanks for stepping up and doing what needs to be done to get your son back on track.\n\nHugs and Good Luck", "NTA\n\nThat's what parents do. Look after their child and correct what they are doing wrong.\n\nBut anyhow I still can't wrap my head around in what world does school opens till 10 or 11 and what would a teen girl have to do there. There is more to the story dad. This is not normal.", "Nta.  And you know it. \n\nYou have to be his parent. Not his friend. \n\nYou have to make the hard decision for him that he's not mature enough to make on his own yet.  \n\nYou have to give your kids enough rope to grow.  They will either run and prosper or hang themselves with it. Well, he hung himself with it. Now, he needs to deal with the consequences. And learn from his mistakes.", "NTA, but your wife is right. You and she need to sit down with your son and find out what's going on with him.", "[deleted]", "NTA. How is he even able to stay out that late? Car? Phone? I\u2019d consider taking steeper measures while also giving him the opportunity to confide in you about whatever he\u2019s \u201cstruggling\u201d with. \n\nHe doesn\u2019t need a gf if he can\u2019t maintain the other aspects and responsibilities in his life.", "NTA.  It\u2019s your job as his parent to look after him, including making sure he sleeps and gets to school.   Your responsibility is to adult!him, and that means making choices that you believe adult!him will appreciate.   Right now, that makes kid!him angry, but that\u2019s what sucks about being a parent.", "NTA, but it sounds like there is much more going on. You need to sit and have several talks with him in a non confrontational way. Changes in grades and behavior are signs that more is going on than just hanging out with his girlfriend. Do you know his friends, his girlfriend, do they hang out at your house? He needs to feel safe coming to you to talk.", "NTA but talk to him because it seems he needs it.", "nta I'm going through the same thing right now with my 15 year old. she just got the same punishment.", "NTA - I'm not going to rate you badly for trying to be an attentive parent. But with a 16 year-old, I think your strategy could backfire. I have no idea what your wife means that he's struggling if all he's doing is hanging out with a girlfriend.", "If he had a specific curfew and he was breaking it, and you told him there\u2019d be consequences if he kept breaking it, then definitely NTA.  I wouldn\u2019t recommend springing this punishment on him if there weren\u2019t specific rules. And personally I would give him a warning so he has a chance to shape up before grounding him.", "NTA. Parents need to *Paren*. And honestly, if you're not feeling like an asshole sometimes, you're not doing it right, imo.  You shouldn't be happy to punish him, but recognize sometimes its necessary.", "NTA, clearly it sent working for him and missing out on sleep because he is doing who knows what with his girl is causing it. If he were really helping her after school hours he wouldn't be home THAT late. I CANNOT think of an after school function that goes til midnight.", "NTA because you are doing your job as a parent. But, agree with the other posts. Check in on your son. Have an open and honest conversation, and maybe start by reasoning using an apology so he\u2019s comfortable to open up. Include your wife and offer suggestions like additional support from you both, a therapist, etc. his well-bring and mental health should be #1 priority. Don\u2019t be an ass and assume he\u2019s just breaking the rules and not struggling at all. Be open to a conversation. \n\nAlso, he\u2019s at an age where you have the ability to really set up your relationship as *adults*. It\u2019s important to hear him out and be open with him", "NTA. It's affecting his grades. Being out til 1-2am hanging out with friends in the neighborhood was real fun when I was that age, but that was summer break.", "NTA. If his grades were fine before he started spending this extra time with her, he\u2019s capable of doing the work and getting results. Education takes priority, and until he can find a better balance\u2026he needs to focus on school.\n\nMidnight is way too late.\n\nSet goals and boundaries and follow them. \n\nBe realistic that he should get some time to socialize.", "You're right that his habits are unhealthy. Your wife is right that something is up with him. YTA if you were mean about it.\n\nNTA for wanting the situation to change.\n\nBut I'd be really sure I knew what was actually happening when he's been out. . . Can you confirm with the GF's family he's been there and under what circumstances?", "I remember being that age and staying out until 12-1 AM and never understood why my parents were \u201cstrict\u201d with my curfew (10pm). In hindsight, I completely understand why they would implement those measures. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing, your kid will understand in time.", "NTA, but you do need to discuss with him what\u2019s going on. He\u2019s obviously not at school the whole time and you likely don\u2019t want to be a grandpa anytime soon.", "NTA\n\nTalk to him as well tho, make sure he's not in an abusive relationship.", "NTA\n\nI can't speak for where you live, but my city actually has a curfew based on a kid's age and the day of the week. So not only is he breaking house rules, he may be breaking the law as well.", "NTA\n\nYour job is to recognize and teach him to recognize when things are \"going off the rail\" when he's young so he can recognize them when he's older. \n\nHis grades are slipping and his sleep has degraded.  These will compound the bad decisions he's been making with his time so far. \n\nJob 2 is teaching corrective action.  Until grades and sleep are better, no leaving the house except for school and family things.  Video games and chats with friends, only after homework and chores are finished.  \n\nYour primary mission is to raise him to be a successful, productive member of society.  Shoddy work and sleepy attendance are big, big negatives to employers.  What he is doing is not working, so now you must take over managing this until he can do it alone.  If you didn't, you would not be doing your job. (I say these last two sentences to my kids when they need it. Remembering is my responsibility and what the goal is, is helpful for them.   It gets them to think about all the things they didn't think about that will affect their futures.  If done with a \"team attitude\", I have found that the kids are very receptive to important points they didn't before.)\n\nHelping him through these life lessons now means he doesn't have to learn the lessons later (on his own!) when he is even more vulnerable than he is now.\n\nAfter a handful of days (which include at least one whole weekend), tell him he can have his friend over whom he's helping.  If she truly needs help, she will be glad to come.  If not, you will know he's not being honest, and there is no real reason for him to be out this late.   Give them a firm end time.  Get her parents' numbers \"just in case something happens\" at your house... but it's really to talk to them and tell them your son has a curfew at X:YZ time, ask if they could help send him on his way when it's time to go home (once his grades are improved and you are ready for him to get out on his own forever)... or to call them if he's there too late. \n\nDoes he drive a car you own?  If this were my kid,  I'd take the keys until grades come up and sleep is better.  Just today, we talked about how he'll lose his phone if there is another missed assignment. \n\nRegardless, I'd limit the phone and any social computer usage to 1-2 hour(s) depending on if he meets up with friends outside or has a job or another thing that rewired him to have his phone in him.  On school nights and only a few hours on the weekends (like 6 total)... anything social needs to be done in front of you. \n\nBut, your wife is correct that you all need to sit down and talk about this kind of stuff.  Otherwise, rules get flexible and people get confused.  That leads kids to break rules, because they don't know where they are this week.  Teenagers need the direction, too.\n\nEmploy education, emotional support, and structure changes to address these issues.  He'll see the change in study time/location as a punishment, but what you are doing is changing them to be more helpful.  Changing things like this is an important life skill.. it will be good to learn it now.", "YTA.... There is something else going on that you are not aware of. You are just going to make him turtle and not want to talk about it. Your Wife is right, he is struggling and needs help. also not for nothing:\n\n*but I'm sick of his behavior and his disregard for school. I don't need my kids becoming unhelpful members of society.*\n\nWhen you say things like this makes you come off as an asshole...", "YTA - NOT for setting boundaries for your child, but because even I can tell you son is obviously going through something and your wife is sharing this concern and you dismiss her AND your sons well being for \u2018grades\u2019 which barely matter any more as long as he has his diploma. Most colleges don\u2019t even look at GPAs anymore", "YTA. Not for the curfew and wanting him to improve his grades, but for your attitude. He's struggling, but you just say you're \"sick of his behavior.\" Other people are saying you should talk to him, but I'm not sure he'd talk to you if you normally have this type of attitude with him.\n\nI think if you enforced a curfew and homework time, while also being there to talk to him and help him with his issues, you wouldn't be an asshole. But punishments don't do much if you don't even understand what you're punishing him for. He has something going on here. Honestly I think it's too late for him to confide in you, but you should tell your wife to talk to him so you both can help him instead of just punishing him.", "YTA. You should talk to him. Make a deal. Children and teens are humans. I don\u2019t know if you remember being one. But they have feelings. And what is going on in his life that is making this happen? \n\nYou won\u2019t get anywhere punishing him.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He's almost an adult. Let him make adult decisions and as a parent, guide him, don't punish him for coming home at midnight. Talk to him like an adult and encourage him to take better care of himself because he needs those good habits in place when he's on his own. Adults don't get punished for being out too late beyond being too tired the next day. Let him learn and stop treating him like a child.", "ESH. There's clearly something more going on here. I don't think this is a situation you can punish him for and leave it at that. He's already reacted badly to things it seems and I expect it'll just push him away. This is the time to look at different methods to correct the behaviour and the best way is to try to figure out WHY he's acting this way and what's going on. Present the solution of a compromise as a way to get some answers to offer guidance. 16 year olds deal with adult situations on a daily basis and they require a combination of being treated like a kid and being treated like an adult.", "NTA, staying out late, lame story-girlfriend he refuses to let you meet, grades slipping, always tired, becoming withdrawn.  There are more issues than just teenage rebellion.  I would say time to pee in a cup.", "This seems like it's gone on for a while and when you finally do confront it you do it in a way your wife disagrees with. You had plenty of time to talk to her about how you want to approach the topic. Think about that.\n\n\nI guess what I'm saying is INFO you come across as not having a discussion with him before because the comment from your wife implies you haven't tried that yet, is this really the case? You also sound like you did discuss it with her, did you ever decide how to handle it or just express concern?", "Honestly, when I was that age I was coming home at around 11.30 because my cheerleading practice was until 9.30 and I took the bus home at 10.15. The school was open until 10 for afterschool activities (organised by the school or an outside organisation just using the space), occasionally even longer if there was an event going on. So that part is marginally believable to me.\n\nThat said, I wish my parents would have stopped that madness. I was literally sleeping 4h-5h a day on average, since I had to leave the house at 6.30 at the latest. I basically lived in the school hallways. That shit does a number on a young person. I was completely burnt out by the time I was 18 and it took more than 7 years to go back to normal. Even if the son and his gf are actually staying in school for completely wholesome and legit schoolwork, it's not healthy and OP needs to put a stop to it for his kid's sake.", "Exactly this. He may be hanging with the gf, but it's not at wholesome school activities", "In NY it was at 10 P.M, right before the late night news.", "OP replied that he has never met the girlfriend.  The son is up to something, and it is not good.", "I haven't actually met his girlfriend. My son told me that she would rather not tell anyone they're dating until after graduation, so we know he's dating someone, just not who.", "[deleted]", "Wow, that's a red flag. You don't have any idea where he's been.", "Your son might be with a teacher dig deeper into this", "I live in the burbs but we got mostly city channels so we got both the 8pm and the 10pm commercials.", "NTA. But you have to be pretty vigilant about this. As others have said, if you have not met this girlfriend, and he's been with her for at least a few months (I didn't notice any timetable), then something isn't right. The GF not wanting anyone to know they're dating wouldn't make sense to meet you, his parents. You're not gonna gossip around town that they're dating, right? If you are the type to do that, then maybe he is reluctant. Young boys or girls will absolutely let their grades and everything slip for a significant other. Hormones do crazy stuff to the brain.\n\nBut my other question is, what are your thoughts on if your son is gay? Could he be with another boy, and he is afraid to tell you thinking you would disapprove? Do you openly say things that may be taken as bigoted? I'm not accusing you, I am just giving you an idea as to why he may be so secretive. But also, as others have said, you need to make sure it's not someone older FROM school taking advantage of him. He is still a kid, your kid.\n\nBut tell him you simply want to meet his girlfriend to know that he is being safe. If it is as simple as he just has a gf as he says, then I don't see why he would object to a quick meeting with her just to be safe. All parents should know who their kids spend time with. If he is out so late, he may be, and probably is, sexually active. This is also something for him to make sure he is being safe about. Just make sure he is being safe and ask that you meet the person he is spending time with regardless of who they are. If he refuses, then something dangerous could be happening, and you need to find out.", "He's struggling and exhausted because he's having copious quantities of sex with his girlfriend.\n\nGiven the choice between having sex and studying for your next trigonometry class, I'm pretty sure which one any young person would choose.\n\nHe's exhausted but I bet he's enjoying it. No wonder he's hacked off you want to pick him up and ruin his romantic evenings.\n\n'Punishing' is the wrong word though. Despite the fun he is clearly having, he needs to concentrate on his school work, whether he likes it or not. There's plenty of time to enjoy some rest and relaxation at the weekend but school is important. Even trigonometry. Apparently\n\nNTA but don't ruin his fun completely", "I think he means she has business there but then they hang out til 10 or 11.  What I don't get is how is 10:00 a ridiculous hour for a 16 yr old to get home?", "I know its a bit different in America and other places but at 16 here I was working 4 days a week, living with friends and generally living up life as much as I could. It's the difficult age where you want to do your own thing and crashing down to hard on that is going to result in insolence.\n\nAnd you can have pretty serious relationships at that age. I'd have been with my first girlfriend for 3 years at that point and loved her a lot. No amount of trying to control me would have stopped me seeing her and I'd have been hateful in response to total prevention of seeing her. Probably would have been defiant enough to do even worse at the things concerning my parents as such is the fire of youth.", "It\u2019s kinda late on a school day. \n\nSure every once in a while is okay\u2026 but it\u2019ll take it\u2019s toll on you", "Another possibility is that something is going on in the girlfriend's life (like a bad situation at home or something) that OP's son is trying to help her with, but it's stressing him out because they're both in over their heads. \n\nI think OP is NTA for cracking down on the son staying out until all hours, but the slipping grades and the change in personality seem to hint that there's more to this than just normal teenage shenanigans."]}
