I have been since I was like 13. For a while, the only person I told was my brother (17M). He was the only person I truly trusted. He teased me for obviously but was never mean and as time went on started to encourage me to finally tell him.\n\nWell, my crush/best friend (16M) is also my brothers best friend. We all grew up together so we are really close. This past year I have been building up the courage to finally confess my feeling. Everyone said he liked me back since he seemed flirty and touchy with me. I was really ready to do it. The only person who didn\u2019t really give me advice starting a couple months ago was my brother. I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n\nLast week, I walked into my brothers room and caught him and our best friend making out. My heart was shattered. I didn\u2019t say anything to them, just quickly left as they tried to explain but what\u2019s there to explain. I just left and went to talk with my friends.\n\nWell, when I got to my friend Audrey\u2019s house, where two of my other friends were hanging out, I learned my friend Quinn already knew my brother and crush had been hooking up and told me it had been going on for a couple months. I was furious that she has known this whole time and kicked her out.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to the three of them for a week and my friends have started to tell me I\u2019m taking this to far. It\u2019s clear they all feel bad about it and say I should just give them a chance to explain but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to hear what they have to say. My best friend went behind my back to hook up with my brother and my brother, knowing I was in love with our friend, hooked up with him anyway. What kind of explanation could they possibly have. I\u2019ve considered talking to my other friend again since I do kind of see why she didn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t know either of them were gay so she probably just didn\u2019t want to out them. But as for my brother and friend, I don\u2019t want to hear them out.\n\nMy friends say they understood me not wanting to talk to them for a couple days but say I\u2019m now kind of being a dramatic asshole since it\u2019s been a week. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole but my friends disagree so I come here to ask you guys.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit:\nSince there seems to be some confused let me explain. I in no way am upset that him and my brother are gay. I am upset mainly that my brother knew how I felt about our friend and still decided to secretly have a relationship with him. And I\u2019m made at our friend for hooking up with my brother behind my back.", "created_utc": 1684376661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13klsao/aita_for_ignoring_my_brother_and_best_friend/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mutual friend, meanwhile, was not aware of your feelings and was free to act as he so desired. You made broad assumptions and that is a you thing. Crushes can hurt like hell. Love is a thing that develops and he did not even feel safe enough with you to come out.

The best friend definitely didn't do anything wrong- he has the right to not be out to his friends, and hook up with whoever he wants. But the brother I think screwed up, at least assuming that he started the relationship after his sister had confessed her feelings to him. I would never have considered starting something with someone I knew my sister was in love with- it would be a complete and total deal-breaker for me. I absolutely think he's being disloyal here, and I think OP has every right to feel hurt and betrayed with respect to him.  I can imagine how stupid and embarrassed she's feeling considering everything she's told her brother. \n\nThat being said, I get that he's a hormonal teenager who can't control his feelings, and I get why he would feel that he's not doing anything wrong if he thinks the bf would never reciprocate OP's feelings. \n\nI think OP probably should get back to being civil, but I'd understand if she never quite felt the same closeness with her brother again. And she's definitely an AH for being so angry with the best friend, but I get that she has a lot of strong emotions right now. I'm going to go with an ESH (excluding the best friend)- no one has behaved particularly well, but I don't think that anyone is necessarily an awful person.", "OP - This is the most reasonable take. Sorry for your heartbreak, but you will get over it eventually.", "Glad I wasn't the only one doing a WTF with the friends house and kicking them out.", "Really just shows how self absorbed OP is and possibly why they didn't feel safe telling her their secret and sexuality.", "I see where the confusion is. I went to my friends house where multiple friends were. Two of my friends were at my friend Audrey\u2019s house. I did not kick her out of her own home I was mad at my friend Quinn and told her to leave. At the time my other two friends agreed but now they think I need to let it go.", "Considering the level of drama she is bringing into the situation, I don't know if telling would have helped either.", "Agree with the YTA rating because of the ownership OP seems to feel toward her friend. That's very not okay. But I also think taking time away from them is well within her right. She suffered a major blow to her feelings, and that can take time to heal.

The best friend is caught in the middle but her brother clearly betrayed her.", "Being up front with OP would have meant outing himself and their friend.  OP didn\u2019t know they were bi/gay/whatever.\n\nNo.  If they hadn\u2019t told their families it meant they weren\u2019t ready to be out.\n\nBest he could have said is \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong about friend being into you.

I understand how upset you are that everyone was hiding this from you. They really should have been upfront about the relationship and not built you up about your crush possibly reciprocating. That really sucks.\n\nBut it's reasonable they wouldn't want to out your brother. It's also reasonable that your brother fell for your crush - feelings are hard to control, and you can't call dibs on a person. It's heartbreaking that your crush doesn't like you back, but calling it a betrayal when you weren't dating him is a bit excessive.\n\nYour feelings are valid, and you can't help how you feel, but you should start working to get past this and stop beating everyone up about it ...before they write you off in return. Don't indulge in the drama too long that you twist the story in your head, you know? \n\nSome counseling from a neutral party might help.", "Who gives a fuck. They are gay.

One day, you can laugh about all of this while being in your own loving relationship.", "yeah NTA - either ppl in the comments are making sh*t up, or you changed the story. cause i see things being mentioned that were already explained in the post. and yeah, your brother is a major AH for hooking up with someone he knew you loved. he knows he\u2019s an AH btw.", "YTA\n\nAnd I feel bad saying that, but one thing you'll have to learn is no one is required to know about or reciprocate your feelings. Neither your brother nor your friend betrayed you simply because they hooked up. They're allowed to do that. \n\nThink of it like this... You'd probably still feel angry and betrayed if this friend had instead been into Audrey and they started dating too, correct? That wouldn't be there problem either because they're people too... Your crush isn't an object that can be stolen.\n\nIt's ok to be upset your crush didn't want to date you. But it's not ok to alienate all these people because you didn't get your way.", "Sorry but YTA. They didn\u2019t betray you, it\u2019s highly possible that when your brother was encouraging you to tell your crush about your feelings he didn\u2019t know your crush was gay, or maybe your brother didn\u2019t know his own feelings for your crush at the time, he stopped encouraging you when they got together and as it had gone in for quite a while he didn\u2019t know how to tell you, he probably felt terrible about it. FYI hooking up with a best friend rarely works out so consider it a bullet dodged and move on.", "YTA. You went to AUDREY'S house and kicked QUINN out! How spoiled are you that you kicked someone out of a house that isn't even yours.", "NAH. Everyone here is just young and in tough positions, they choose the worst strategy but even the best one would have probably create drama, right now your are mourning what could have been, but please remember the good times too, you cutting them is probably their worst fear and the reason the kept it a secret I  the first place, I sincerely hope you all can get past it and are able to mend the situation.  Good luck.", "NTA \n\nWho cares they are gay? If he were was your sister instead of brother the betrayal of trust would be the same.\n\nYou may not be owed anyone's love, but you shouldn't be friends with people doing things like that behind your back. \n\nBy which I mean hooking up with your love interest without telling you they are also into your love interest, or at worst telling after they first got involved. Kerping it a secret from you is not what a friend would do either. You can't trust or rely on them.\n\nFinally if your love interest is gay, is too much to expect that people you tell about your crush inform you about this?", "YTA, nobody betrayed you because nobody owed anything to you. This is a painful life lesson, take it and grow up some.", "NTA, that 17 year old dude making out with a 13 year old is a creep.", "NTA you are allowed to be mad atm them and your feelings are valid. I don't really understand the y t a since your brother and best friend betrayed you", "See, I get your feelings. Your best friend and your brother are two important figures in your life and the latter is your family. You trusted them enough to confide in you. They didn't and you got hurt. \n\nQueer people have a hard time coming out due to societal behavior and reactions. Maybe they were scared too. But you have a right to feel betrayed that your brother, who knew about your feelings, didn't mention anything to you. It was an AH move, ngl here. Anyone who says otherwise clearly doesn't understand how relationships, emotions and feelings work. Your elder brother must look out for you. \n\nI think it is best that you do communicate with both of them though. They have a right to pursue their romance and your unwillingness to talk to them is only going to hurt you. Talk to your brother and express your hurt and disappointment that he kept such a big thing from you and let you almost make a fool of yourself, confessing your love to your gay best friend who is actually your brother's boyfriend. Your best friend doesn't really need to be accountable to you for his romances (although if he considered you a true best friend, he would let you know) but you and your brother are family- there should be a clear conversation. \n\nSee if their explanations make things better for you. If not, take your time to heal and request for space or lower contact. Since you have mentioned in other comments that you aren't homophobic, let them know that you support them and their orientations. \n\nIt's been a week OP. I am sure you are yourself miserable over having to ignore a brother you were close enough to confess your feelings to and your best friend. Act before the doors that could have allowed you to return to some normalcy close from their side. Much love to you\u2764\n\nNAH (but YWBTA if you keep it up).", "I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I had a similar situation when I was your age. You do not wanna burn these bridges forever, but I know you may not be prepared to talk yet. I would approach your brother and best friend and tell them you\u2019re not at all mad, just really really hurt and need to take some distance. I would also talk to the friend who knew all along and explain that you\u2019re just hurt, not mad. I know it sounds like a lot especially when you could very well be a bit mad, but it\u2019s best not to express that as the anger is misplaced. I think everyone else here in the comments has done a pretty good job of telling the story from the other perspectives, so this is just my advice.", "YTA\n\nYou assumed he liked you. If they had told you he wasn't into you, you would've pressed for more info. \n\nThey don't trust you with this secret. Probably because of this style of reaction from you.", "I\u2019m confused by people saying she\u2019s wrong for feeling betrayed- people get upset with their FRIENDS for hooking up with their crush knowing they\u2019re in love with them but she\u2019s not allowed to be upset her own brother did it to her know she was in love with the guy?", "YTA", "YTA. You don't get to reserve people you are not in a relationship with. Especially for years! Obviously friends / relatives should show some concern, but if they're right for each other, they're right for each other.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso, secondly, if he's gay and you're female, I have a really difficult truth to tell you: it's not going to work out.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's normal to feel upset, especially as a young person, but yes, get over it.", "This is exactly it", "Someone did do something to hurt her, her own brother, he knew and still went ahead and made out with his sisters crush. There is a ah here the brother, not op not crush, just bro. But u r right op wbta if she continues ignoring them. She can choose to take a step back from both of those relationships.", "Her brother stabbed her in the back because he knew that she had a crush on the friend and wanted to tell the crush \ud83e\udd14", "The ownership aspect here is the real problem. If best friend was actually boyfriend, that would be a different story, but that's not the case.", "It is a betrayal idk gay or not, the brother still went after his sisters crush. She is allowed to be very upset.", "No, nobody ever has the right to out someone else. It was not his to tell.", "nobody has the right to out someone else without their expressed permission", "How do u know the bsf was not in love with her?", "Sounds like the only person not encouraging her to tell the crush was the brother. He was discouraging her for the last few months but she didn\u2019t think anything of it because her other friends were encouraging her to confess her feelings.", "Ah, check the ages again, it's a 17 year old making out with a 16 year old. They've been friends since they were 13.", "The best friend didn\u2019t do anything. He literally didn\u2019t know she had a crush on him as she never told him. He didn\u2019t betray anyone.", "It\u2019s highly probable that OP\u2019s brother was trying to be respectful to their boyfriend by not outing him to OP. \nFrom personal experience the only people who I\u2019ve verbally told that I\u2019m bi was other queer friends.", "Quite entitled behaviour telling someone to leave someone elses house", "the gay thing is a new twist. if you didn\u2019t know he was or both were gay you wouldn\u2019t even expect this situation was a triangle", "Crush =/= dibs\n\nYou can crush on someone all you want. Why was her crush a block for the brother, but his crush not valid? She verbalized her feelings out loud and gets the cosmic dibs?\n\nPeople don't get to call dibs. They never dated.\n\nEven then, why would her crush preclude them from dating? Chances are they're not bi. She never had a chance, but now this gay guy can't date anyone in the friend group because of a straight girl with a crush?\n\nThat's not how that works.\n\nShe can feel upset her brother hid things. She can feel upset her friend didn't let her down gently and hid things. She can feel upset her crush was unrequited.\n\nDoes not get to block this guy from dating everyone she knows because she said she thought he was cute first.", "They both are gay doofus. And bf and brother clearly didn't feel comfortable to come out to her sister.", "The brother didn't need to out himself to not encourage the OP to pursue her crush.", "Well ok we don\u2019t. But she never told him, never asked him out, never insinuated she wanted more. \n\nEven if he picked up on it (or bro was a big dick and told him) how did he betray her by starting a relationship with his other best friend?", "Them being gay doesn't mean her feelings just go away. She's allowed to feel what she's feeling.", "They didnt feel comfortable because the brother knew he was fucking his sisters crush of course they didnt tell her. Guilty mind.", "There's a difference between \"everyone she knows\", and her brother. I was kind of shocked by how unsympathetic the comments are here, but I think OP is reasonable in expecting more loyalty from a sibling (I'm operating under the assumption that the brother started the relationship after OP had confessed- this seems reasonable since it seems she told him years ago).\n\nI mean, she claimed to be in love with him, so she definitely wasn't portraying it as just finding him cute. And while a casual friend might be expected to ignore that, I feel like a good brother would care about hurting his sister. And being her brother means that it'll be impossible for OP to escape being around her unreciprocating crush, which means the consequences are also worse for her than if some other random person started dating him. I would never have done this to my sister, and I'm pretty sure she wouldn't do it to me. My loyalty and love for my sister trumps any romantic feelings I might have for someone before I start a relationship with them. OP may have implicitly expected this of her brother, and been hurt to find out that she doesn't mean that much to him.\n\nI think part of the issue here is that reddit commenters tend to value romantic relationships over relationships with birth families unless there's cheating involved. But I also think everyone's giving a pass to the brother because he's gay (or bisexual), and they're making this into a \"he has a right to remain closeted\" thing, rather than a \"he could have chosen not to get into a relationship that would deeply hurt his sister\" thing. Personally, I don't think that being closeted is an excuse to act like an AH, and I'm actually quite angry on OP's behalf that everyone around her will likely frame her anger as being homophobic when she has every right to be angry at her brother."]}
