I have been since I was like 13. For a while, the only person I told was my brother (17M). He was the only person I truly trusted. He teased me for obviously but was never mean and as time went on started to encourage me to finally tell him.\n\nWell, my crush/best friend (16M) is also my brothers best friend. We all grew up together so we are really close. This past year I have been building up the courage to finally confess my feeling. Everyone said he liked me back since he seemed flirty and touchy with me. I was really ready to do it. The only person who didn\u2019t really give me advice starting a couple months ago was my brother. I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n\nLast week, I walked into my brothers room and caught him and our best friend making out. My heart was shattered. I didn\u2019t say anything to them, just quickly left as they tried to explain but what\u2019s there to explain. I just left and went to talk with my friends.\n\nWell, when I got to my friend Audrey\u2019s house, where two of my other friends were hanging out, I learned my friend Quinn already knew my brother and crush had been hooking up and told me it had been going on for a couple months. I was furious that she has known this whole time and kicked her out.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to the three of them for a week and my friends have started to tell me I\u2019m taking this to far. It\u2019s clear they all feel bad about it and say I should just give them a chance to explain but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to hear what they have to say. My best friend went behind my back to hook up with my brother and my brother, knowing I was in love with our friend, hooked up with him anyway. What kind of explanation could they possibly have. I\u2019ve considered talking to my other friend again since I do kind of see why she didn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t know either of them were gay so she probably just didn\u2019t want to out them. But as for my brother and friend, I don\u2019t want to hear them out.\n\nMy friends say they understood me not wanting to talk to them for a couple days but say I\u2019m now kind of being a dramatic asshole since it\u2019s been a week. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole but my friends disagree so I come here to ask you guys.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit:\nSince there seems to be some confused let me explain. I in no way am upset that him and my brother are gay. I am upset mainly that my brother knew how I felt about our friend and still decided to secretly have a relationship with him. And I\u2019m made at our friend for hooking up with my brother behind my back.", "created_utc": 1684376661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13klsao/aita_for_ignoring_my_brother_and_best_friend/", "score": 380, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your mutual friend, meanwhile, was not aware of your feelings and was free to act as he so desired. You made broad assumptions and that is a you thing. Crushes can hurt like hell. Love is a thing that develops and he did not even feel safe enough with you to come out.

The best friend definitely didn't do anything wrong- he has the right to not be out to his friends, and hook up with whoever he wants. But the brother I think screwed up, at least assuming that he started the relationship after his sister had confessed her feelings to him. I would never have considered starting something with someone I knew my sister was in love with- it would be a complete and total deal-breaker for me. I absolutely think he's being disloyal here, and I think OP has every right to feel hurt and betrayed with respect to him.  I can imagine how stupid and embarrassed she's feeling considering everything she's told her brother. \n\nThat being said, I get that he's a hormonal teenager who can't control his feelings, and I get why he would feel that he's not doing anything wrong if he thinks the bf would never reciprocate OP's feelings. \n\nI think OP probably should get back to being civil, but I'd understand if she never quite felt the same closeness with her brother again. And she's definitely an AH for being so angry with the best friend, but I get that she has a lot of strong emotions right now. I'm going to go with an ESH (excluding the best friend)- no one has behaved particularly well, but I don't think that anyone is necessarily an awful person.", "OP - This is the most reasonable take. Sorry for your heartbreak, but you will get over it eventually.", "Glad I wasn't the only one doing a WTF with the friends house and kicking them out.", "Really just shows how self absorbed OP is and possibly why they didn't feel safe telling her their secret and sexuality.", "I see where the confusion is. I went to my friends house where multiple friends were. Two of my friends were at my friend Audrey\u2019s house. I did not kick her out of her own home I was mad at my friend Quinn and told her to leave. At the time my other two friends agreed but now they think I need to let it go.", "Considering the level of drama she is bringing into the situation, I don't know if telling would have helped either.", "Agree with the YTA rating because of the ownership OP seems to feel toward her friend. That's very not okay. But I also think taking time away from them is well within her right. She suffered a major blow to her feelings, and that can take time to heal.

The best friend is caught in the middle but her brother clearly betrayed her.", "Being up front with OP would have meant outing himself and their friend.  OP didn\u2019t know they were bi/gay/whatever.\n\nNo.  If they hadn\u2019t told their families it meant they weren\u2019t ready to be out.\n\nBest he could have said is \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong about friend being into you.

I understand how upset you are that everyone was hiding this from you. They really should have been upfront about the relationship and not built you up about your crush possibly reciprocating. That really sucks.\n\nBut it's reasonable they wouldn't want to out your brother. It's also reasonable that your brother fell for your crush - feelings are hard to control, and you can't call dibs on a person. It's heartbreaking that your crush doesn't like you back, but calling it a betrayal when you weren't dating him is a bit excessive.\n\nYour feelings are valid, and you can't help how you feel, but you should start working to get past this and stop beating everyone up about it ...before they write you off in return. Don't indulge in the drama too long that you twist the story in your head, you know? \n\nSome counseling from a neutral party might help.", "Who gives a fuck. They are gay.

I would never have done this to my sister, and I'm pretty sure she wouldn't do it to me. My loyalty and love for my sister trumps any romantic feelings I might have for someone before I start a relationship with them. OP may have implicitly expected this of her brother, and been hurt to find out that she doesn't mean that much to him.\n\nI think part of the issue here is that reddit commenters tend to value romantic relationships over relationships with birth families unless there's cheating involved.

Personally, I don't think that being closeted is an excuse to act like an AH, and I'm actually quite angry on OP's behalf that everyone around her will likely frame her anger as being homophobic when she has every right to be angry at her brother.", "You aren\u2019t the main character here.

Shit happens.\n\nIf you recontextualize this into being upset at the circumstances and not your brother/friend, it might help you come to terms.

Best friends aren't supposed to go behind your back with your siblings, that's an unspoken rule. If he would have come to you about it, I'm sure that would have eliminated that aspect but he didn't. So here we have a best friend who broke the unspoken best friend code, a brother who hooked up with a known crush that he teased you about for years and on top of all that you found out this way that they were both gay. I think for a teenager still learning to process their emotions, this is an emotional overload. There's even some adults that would struggle with this.

I'm sure she is upset that her brother never trusted her enough to tell her, when she has obviously been confiding in him but she didn't emphasize that so I don't believe that's the point she's trying to make at all. I'm also sure she's quite aware she has no chance with the best friend, ahem, for obvious reasons.\n\nEdit: I will say this after reading some of the comments, I do agree she is acting immature and self-centered but she's a teenager.

Way to prove them right, I guess.", "Aw mate. YTA. I get that it hurts, but they didn't do anything wrong here. They like each other; would you honestly want them to bottle those feelings up and not be happy just because you also happen to have feelings for your friend? That's just not how life works; this won't be the first time someone you 'love' finds happiness with someone else I'm afraid. \n\nThey are entitled to privacy, and given how you reacted...can you see why they held off telling you? Add the complexity of having to come out and it's even more understandable why they kept this private.\n\nQuinn was absolutely right not to tell you btw. Sounds like a decent person.", "You are not really an AH, but grow up. You are just a teenager, exploring boundaries: what are they, what are mine, what are those of others, what is reasonable, what is just, what is ethical ... and just go on.\n\nThis sucks, yes.

I guess they decided not to tell you. That is a valid decision. Maybe they thought that you would explode. And apparently you did. \n\nSuck it up, congratulate your brother.

NTA OP, i understand your frustration. they're teens like you, you're all immature, though it's not something to be mad at for a lifetime.", "You have every right to be upset....with your brother.  When you confessed your feelings that was the opportunity for him to say, hey I have feelings for him too, let's figure this out.  He was dead wrong for that. He also actively encouraged you to tell him, and assuming at that point he and the BFF were already hooking up, DEAD wrong.  \n\nThe BFF is a bit tricky.  You don't own him and even if he knew you had a crush on him he's not obligated to like you back. On the other hand, it's very messy to start hooking up in a tight friend group and also why wouldn't he (they)  tell you if he's really your BFF.  \n\nThe third friend, I get why you're mad but I think you have worked out for yourself that it can be a bit tricky for ppl who have info that they shouldn't have. No matter what move they make they're betraying someone. I wouldn't hold that against her. \n\nI think you're NTA because you are having a natural reaction to a series of crushing blows.

Meet new people, have new friends, maybe you would get sooner or later another crush you could actually have a relationship with. \n\nSo, stop ignoring them but put distance. \n\nRegarding to your brother, he needs to fix and try to get your trust back.

OP sees this as a massive betrayal, but she wasn't owed him revealing such a deeply personal bit about himself. And, the brother couldn't really reveal the truth about his relationship without outing himself or OP's friend....\n\nRight now, OP sees this as being entirely about a great wrong done to them, but this is just two young men exploring their sexuality. OP wanted more than a platonic friendship from the bestfriend, but that was never offered.\n\nEDIT: I was going with NAH, but I'm going YTA since OP is outing the brother/bestfriend to her entire friend group and her kicking her third friend out of someone else's home since they didn't betray the brother/bestfriend's trust is not OK.", "But for a moment let's imagine we're talking about 2 sisters. One of them has a crush on this guy for years, and told her sister about it. Later she finds out her sister and and her crush are both dating/ hooking. Wouldn't we say that the sister is an Ahole? So just because they're gay, why should the situation change? I think the brother is an AH here. She has the right to be upset. But only at her brother, not her crush. He doesn't owr her anything.

You'll find someone to love you and to love.", "Isn't this similar to Kate 's story from firefly lane?", "Idk the brother letting her perpetuate her feelings for the best friend is asshole behaviour.

If they have feelings for each other and aren't ready to be out yet, they owe nothing to OP. OP is being ridiculous here.", "Right?! It\u2019s not like this was a new crush or a king dead crush, she has told her brother starting YEARS ago, that she was in love with his BFF. So unless he was dating his best friend for years, he knew before beginning the relationship how it would hurt his sister (likely why he kept it from her). This is what my brain keeps tripping over.\n\nYes you don\u2019t have the right to someone else\u2019s affections, nor can you call dibs. But I can see the betrayal/hurt from the brothers actions. Even if he wasn\u2019t prepared to come out to her (but was fine with HER friend knowing-odd), he could have started broaching the subject of bff not being into her, rather than allowing people to keep building her up and saying how he liked her. \n\n\nOr you know\u2026.he could have NOT been encouraging her to tell her crush. THAT just makes the brother seem malicious", "Plus we don't know if they are actually gay, they could be bi or anything under the bi umbrella", "Or closeted homosexual.

OP let this go, take the L and go after straight guys next time.", "I disagree. You can't call dibs on people. If you have a crush on someome, but that someone has a crush on your sister/brother/friend and the other reciprocates... then it's just selfish to keep them apart, regardless of sexuality. She can be hurt of course, and she has a right to her time to process things, but she can't demand they split or call dibs or expect her brother not to be with him for an unrequited crush.", "So you're saying a closeted gay person should have outed himself and all of the scary baggage that can often come with that so his straight sister wouldn't feel so sad? \n\nWhat in the heteronormativity is this reply?!", "Please...she's 16. She'll have forgotten this crush even happened 6 months from now.\n\nShe didn't like him enough to confess, her brother did though. If she was serious she wouldve stood up and confessed despite her fears, but she didn't.

He could've played dumb (\"Oh, i didn't notice any flirting\").

That's a lousy thing to do to anyone, let alone your own sibling.", "Well yeah that's a different story entirely?", "Because them being gay makes it a different situation entirely. The brother didn\u2019t want to out the friend and her other friends didn\u2019t want to out him either. And they were right not to seeing as her first reaction was to go to her friends house and out them. OP has a right to feel upset and betrayed but she shouldn\u2019t ruin her relationship with her friend(s) and brother and possibly strain/ruin the brothers new relationship with the friend.", "That's where it gets tricky.  But it wouldn't have hurt anyone if brother told sister that he knew her crush was seeing someone else.", "I partially agree with you. Quinn may not have the right to give out their secret. But the person in question can. Her brother did not have to hide this from her. What did he expect was going to happen?", "They're just giving an example. We're judging OP's situation. And there, OP is the AH slightly for being mad at her friend and crush. She doesn't have that right. However she being mad at her brother is completely valid. Is what we're saying.", "I'm not the one to give advice, that's upto OP. We're just judging if what she did is right or not.

So...", ">So basically two people can't be in a relationship because a sibling has feelings for the friend.\n\nFixed that for you. And they can be in a relationship, if they talk to the sibling first. It's basic courtesy when you care about someone.

Sexuality is not a shield from morality.", "Their sexual preferences are not the issue here. If she was a lesbian, the bff was a woman and bro was cishet the situation would be the same.", "This isn't some random straight girl, it's his sister. That's the issue.", "Where did you read that OP thought so? Her brother knew about her feelings and decided to pursue. He hurt her and is you really can't see the problem with it you show a great lack of empathy", "Yeah and I really don't get the comments that tell OP she shouldn't have assumed the friends is into her. All her friends told her to he's into her and I really can't comprehend the one friend who knew about the relationship between the brother and best friend. This friend could have given Op a hint, she didn't need to out them but there are so many other routes this friend could have said something. It's too late now and I would be so devastated in OP s situation... I'm so angry at all the Y T A votes who dismiss the betrayal.", "Yeah but he shouldn't have encouraged her to tell the friend about her crush if he knew he was already hooking up with them. Gay or not that was an AH thing to do to his sister.", "Sure, but the brother shouldn't have encouraged her to confess if he knew the friend was otherwise occupied. He could have just said \"I don't think he feels that way about you\" or \"I think he's into someone else\" without revealing specifics. I don't think she's in the wrong for being mad about that. Her reaction and subsequent behavior wasn't great though, but ultimately, they are all super young and will get over it.", "Still not an AH. She doesn't have ownership over either of them and they don't owe her an explanation.", "I agree there, and her brother has a lot of growing up to do too, and the other young person.", "How do you come to the conclusion that he was sleeping with his friend while he was encouraging OPs feelings? That is pure conjecture. Being that he is 17 himself it seems more likely something happened between him and his friend 2 months ago - which is why he stopped encouraging the behaviour as he was exploring his own sexuality and feelings. \n\nHow is not encouraging it, not pretty much the same as (oh I didn't notice any flirting). She even noticed he stopped. Drawing attention to yourself and having to answer questions as to why you feel certain ways (esp since bro is his bestie) is gona raise eyebrows.", "She does not owe them her friendship. He didn't need to out him, but the least he could do is not hook up with her love interest behind her back.\n\nBeing gay does not give you a pass to be an asshole.", "The problem with that is we don\u2019t know what type of person OP is; a likely scenario (because they are teens and tend to be dramatic) that could of happened if OP\u2019s brother said anything, would\u2019ve OP try to pressure their brother into saying who they were dating or how they knew.", "Exactly. Don't y'all remember the girls code or bro code or something that you do not hook up with a person, your friend is interested in? And this is even worse because it is her brother. He destroys the trust his sister has put in him and for that she's an AH? Nah. Can't see that, but what I see is that the brother sister relationship will never ever be the same.", "He stopped encouraging when their relationship started. She states that her brother had stopped encouraging her a couple months ago.", "We don't have a timeline for when he told her to confess her feelings vs when he himself realized the friend was gay and developed feelings for him, himself.", "Wow if you have siblings I feel sorry for them, you clearly have no empathy.", "\"as time went on \\[the brother\\] started to encourage me to finally tell him.\"\n\n\"my friend ... already knew my brother and crush had been hooking up and told me it had been going on for a couple months.\"\n\nExploring one's sexuality and feelings is fine, but that doesn't mean other people's feeling just magically disappear.  The brother *knew* she had feelings for the crush.  \n\nRemaining neutral and/or playing dumb is better than actively encouraging someone to pursue a person who is not interested or available - *because you are sleeping with that person.*\n\nHonestly, I think the brother should've told the truth from the beginning.  I know we don't know if the brother was out yet, but if he was, he should've said something.", "You just don't steal other people's crushs. Like if the brother had let OP make her move, waited til she got rejected and then had made a move of his own - totally different story. But keeping from your sister that you're dating the person that she has a crush on really is an AH move."]}
