I have been since I was like 13. For a while, the only person I told was my brother (17M). He was the only person I truly trusted. He teased me for obviously but was never mean and as time went on started to encourage me to finally tell him.\n\nWell, my crush/best friend (16M) is also my brothers best friend. We all grew up together so we are really close. This past year I have been building up the courage to finally confess my feeling. Everyone said he liked me back since he seemed flirty and touchy with me. I was really ready to do it. The only person who didn\u2019t really give me advice starting a couple months ago was my brother. I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\n\nLast week, I walked into my brothers room and caught him and our best friend making out. My heart was shattered. I didn\u2019t say anything to them, just quickly left as they tried to explain but what\u2019s there to explain. I just left and went to talk with my friends.\n\nWell, when I got to my friend Audrey\u2019s house, where two of my other friends were hanging out, I learned my friend Quinn already knew my brother and crush had been hooking up and told me it had been going on for a couple months. I was furious that she has known this whole time and kicked her out.\n\nI haven\u2019t spoken to the three of them for a week and my friends have started to tell me I\u2019m taking this to far. It\u2019s clear they all feel bad about it and say I should just give them a chance to explain but I don\u2019t care. I don\u2019t want to hear what they have to say. My best friend went behind my back to hook up with my brother and my brother, knowing I was in love with our friend, hooked up with him anyway. What kind of explanation could they possibly have. I\u2019ve considered talking to my other friend again since I do kind of see why she didn\u2019t say anything, I didn\u2019t know either of them were gay so she probably just didn\u2019t want to out them. But as for my brother and friend, I don\u2019t want to hear them out.\n\nMy friends say they understood me not wanting to talk to them for a couple days but say I\u2019m now kind of being a dramatic asshole since it\u2019s been a week. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m an asshole but my friends disagree so I come here to ask you guys.\n\nAm I the asshole?\n\n\nEdit:\nSince there seems to be some confused let me explain. I in no way am upset that him and my brother are gay. I am upset mainly that my brother knew how I felt about our friend and still decided to secretly have a relationship with him. And I\u2019m made at our friend for hooking up with my brother behind my back.", "created_utc": 1684376661, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13klsao/aita_for_ignoring_my_brother_and_best_friend/", "score": 46, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nobody stabbed you in the back, but your brother may not have felt ready to confide in you about his sexuality and if you blow up at your brother and your friends about this, you\u2019re only going to push him away. I\u2019m not sure anyone needs to \u201cexplain\u201d though.

I understand you are hurt, but it does feel like you thought you could call dibs. Queer people are often scared to come out for good reason. Have you even seen the news these days? But your brother knew about your feelings and should have found some way to discourage you without exposing either of them. Your mutual friend, meanwhile, was not aware of your feelings and was free to act as he so desired. You made broad assumptions and that is a you thing. Crushes can hurt like hell. Love is a thing that develops and he did not even feel safe enough with you to come out. Your brother is the only one who may deserve your ire and still... even it weren't him it would not be you, and you need to accept that. You are bringing the teen drama, stop it. Try using some method like journaling or art to get your feelings out and use this as a time to grow.

Two people grew feelings for each other and maybe it was hard for your brother to fess up because of the factors involved. You're going to need to talk to them eventually.

The best friend definitely didn't do anything wrong- he has the right to not be out to his friends, and hook up with whoever he wants. But the brother I think screwed up, at least assuming that he started the relationship after his sister had confessed her feelings to him. I would never have considered starting something with someone I knew my sister was in love with- it would be a complete and total deal-breaker for me. I absolutely think he's being disloyal here, and I think OP has every right to feel hurt and betrayed with respect to him.  I can imagine how stupid and embarrassed she's feeling considering everything she's told her brother. \n\nThat being said, I get that he's a hormonal teenager who can't control his feelings, and I get why he would feel that he's not doing anything wrong if he thinks the bf would never reciprocate OP's feelings. \n\nI think OP probably should get back to being civil, but I'd understand if she never quite felt the same closeness with her brother again. And she's definitely an AH for being so angry with the best friend, but I get that she has a lot of strong emotions right now. I'm going to go with an ESH (excluding the best friend)- no one has behaved particularly well, but I don't think that anyone is necessarily an awful person.", "OP - This is the most reasonable take. Sorry for your heartbreak, but you will get over it eventually.", "Glad I wasn't the only one doing a WTF with the friends house and kicking them out.", "Really just shows how self absorbed OP is and possibly why they didn't feel safe telling her their secret and sexuality.", "I see where the confusion is. I went to my friends house where multiple friends were. Two of my friends were at my friend Audrey\u2019s house. I did not kick her out of her own home I was mad at my friend Quinn and told her to leave. At the time my other two friends agreed but now they think I need to let it go.", "Considering the level of drama she is bringing into the situation, I don't know if telling would have helped either.", "Agree with the YTA rating because of the ownership OP seems to feel toward her friend. That's very not okay. But I also think taking time away from them is well within her right. She suffered a major blow to her feelings, and that can take time to heal. That's assuming the distance is because she needs space and not just because she wants to be spiteful, of course.", "I don\u2019t think it\u2019s about calling dibs on a person Her brother KNEW she was crushing and encouraged her to say something to him. The best friend is caught in the middle but her brother clearly betrayed her.", "Being up front with OP would have meant outing himself and their friend.  OP didn\u2019t know they were bi/gay/whatever.\n\nNo.  If they hadn\u2019t told their families it meant they weren\u2019t ready to be out.\n\nBest he could have said is \u201cI think you\u2019re wrong about friend being into you.  You should focus your attention on literally anyone else.\u201d  And then OP wouldn\u2019t have believed him anyway.\n\nIt\u2019s not like OP was being cheated on, OP had no romantic relationship with friend.  No responsibility to disclose their relationship.", "OP immediately left and TOLD PEOPLE. If they were worried that OP could not be trusted not to out them, they were right.", "Maybe because he knew he had completely fucked up? Nobody expects OPs brother to pressure their friend into a relationship. But it's basic human decency not to hook up with your sibling crush that they confided in you and only you.", "I do think you need to let it go. I understand how upset you are that everyone was hiding this from you. They really should have been upfront about the relationship and not built you up about your crush possibly reciprocating. That really sucks.\n\nBut it's reasonable they wouldn't want to out your brother. It's also reasonable that your brother fell for your crush - feelings are hard to control, and you can't call dibs on a person. It's heartbreaking that your crush doesn't like you back, but calling it a betrayal when you weren't dating him is a bit excessive.\n\nYour feelings are valid, and you can't help how you feel, but you should start working to get past this and stop beating everyone up about it ...before they write you off in return. Don't indulge in the drama too long that you twist the story in your head, you know? \n\nSome counseling from a neutral party might help.", "Who gives a fuck. They are gay. You had no chance in the beginning anyways. The fact that they didn't feel comfortable enough to tell you shows how much they don't trust you.
