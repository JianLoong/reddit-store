You didn't say you hated kids or babies are smelly or people who have kids are terrible to the environment or really one of any dozen of things you could say that WOULD be offensive.  You just don't want kids.  Fine.  \n\nYour mom is offended because she wants you to have kids and you don't want to have them.  Well, she doesn't get control of that decision.  So that sucks for her I guess.", "NTA - the only way I (I'm currently 7 months pregnant and struggled to get pregnant for context) I can see this being offensive is if you completely out of nowhere on meeting a baby went on a long tirade about hating kids and never wanting one and how people who have them are stupid etc.\n\nYour mum brought it up, you quite politely replied with an honest answer that gives no general judgement about your family members deciding to have children. I genuinely see no issue. Not everyone is required to want kids just because other people want them and sometimes struggle to have them.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't offended for them. She was using them as an excuse to get mad at you for calling out her BS. You are absolutely right. If it's such a touchy topic for them, why on Earth would she bring it up in front of them knowing you don't want to have kids? Also, I know tons of people, of all genders, who don't want children. Your mom is sorely misinformed about (for lack of a better word) breeding norms in humankind now.", "NTA. She already knew you don\u2019t want kids but pushed the conversation in that direction anyways so you corrected her on it pretty straightforward. I doubt she\u2019s actually upset because it was \u201crude\u201d towards your brother and SIL, i\u2019m confident she\u2019s the one offended by it.", "Nta. It's becoming pretty normal to not want kids. My partner and I don't want children because we're both career oriented and we both very much enjoy our lifestyle, we go overseas twice a year, do weekend trips etc. (Something both my siblings and her sister are incredibly jealous of because they can't travel)\n\nI'm also very happy to be an uncle, baby sit my nephew and niece (I'm also her godfather).\n\nYour brother and SIL definitely aren't offended. Your mother is upset because she wants more grandchildren and obviously doesn't agree with your views that women can actually not want children.\n\nPlenty of men don't want children either. Don't let your mother make passive comments such as that and I would keep reaffirming your stance not wanting children.\n\nWho knows, in your 30s you may change your mind- but it's for you to change your mind, not your mother or any future partners to pressure you to do so.", "NTA - to thine own self be true", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you jumped out of the blue to say you don\u2019t want kids. Your mom tried using her words to manipulate and control you, and it\u2019s not working so she\u2019s calling you rude. Even if you did want kids- 17 is NOT the right age to be thinking about it. \n\nMy mom does the exact same thing. When I was 20 I was really into going to the gym and my curves got bigger as a result. Well my mum said I was getting fat, and my fianc\u00e9 (don\u2019t have one) would think I was ugly if I couldn\u2019t even shed a few pounds (we use metric not imperial here) then I wouldn\u2019t be able to fit in my wedding dress (I haven\u2019t even bought it yet) \n\nMost of the time this comes from women who have lived their lives being pressured into the standards of others, and are jealous that you live in a time when you don\u2019t have to do that. I\u2019d say just ignore her when she says it, that\u2019s what I did and it worked. Good luck!", "NTA. Why is your mother so hung up about her 17 year old wanting kids anyway? You're still a minor.", "NTA your mom is just mad you stood up for yourself. She probably thought she could keep you from arguing by talking in front of others", "NTA.  /r/childfree is your support group", "Sane people with kids aren\u2019t offended because other people prefer not to have kids.

She keeps telling me that one day I will want them and be ready. Just stick to what you want and your mom will have to get with the program eventually. You could ask your brother and SIL if it bothered them. But, since you didn't say anything bad about their baby. I'm gonna say they probably aren't offended.", "NTA.\n\nAnd as for that \"probably going to change my mind about it\" thing: we're in our mid-50s and have been married for decades, and still don't want kids.  It is far from inevitable.", "NTA", "NTA", "NTA", "Nta. You didn't say anything offensive, just stated your preference when *she* brought it up.

Your mum will have built up the dream image of her grand children, but life doesn't always work the way you expect.

I am 37 and have been saying my whole life that I don't want kids and no matter how many times my mom and my Italian aunties have told me I would change my mind, guess what? I have not changed my mind. You did not disrespect your bro and SIL's fertility struggle by not wanting to have your own. It sounds like they are well adjusted and absorbed in caring for their newborn and did not register your comment. Not everyone has baby rabies and is obsessed with having them. (Liking babies is fine, wanting them is fine, I have a big problem with people who are obsessed with OTHER PEOPLE having babies! Mind your own business overbearing moms/aunts/grandmas!!!) I have a bunch of nieces and nephews and I will take being the 'cool aunt' who gets the best toys over being a mom any day! Kids are great, but, only if they are not mine and I can give them back.

However I think there could be compromises made such as withholding certain information during certain times. Maybe your mother didn\u2019t think it was the appropriate time and place to express that. There are phrases you could say that express neutrality like \u201cawww really?\u201d(if she complimented you, she\u2019s expressing to you that you appear comforting and nurturing to the baby). Flat out dismissing the compliment could be what also upset her in this case.", "NTA\n\nYou didn't say anything offensive or rude about their baby or kids in general for that matter\n\nIt's not offensive to not have kids.

My mom tried to guilt me in my early 20's by saying \"who's going to take care of you when you're old?\".  To which I replied \"all the money I've saved by not having them\".  When I married my husband, who also didn't want kids, she let it go.  If you change your mind when you get older, no biggie.  As females it's our choice, not the previous generations to make it for you.", "NTA. It\u2019s not like you told them having their kid was a mistake or something like that, you only stated something about yourself. Just because they had problems conceiving doesn\u2019t mean every person NEEDS to have children just because they can. The whole you\u2019ll change your mind is a giant pile of BS.", "NTA. \n\nMy brother has two kids. I have stated time and time again that I don't want them. Thats doesn't mean I don't love my niece and nephew. I spoil them, take them to museums, pumpkin patches and such. I would do anything for them but kids have never been in the cards as far as I'm concerned. \nIt's not like you said you hate their kid but some people are born to be parents and some are there to love and spoil their kids and give them back.", "YTA \n\nA lot of people with fertility issues hate when people who are fertile talk about not wanting to have children. And your mom is right, you\u2019ll most likely change your mind in the future. After all, your body is made to carry and birth children.", "NTA. You just sound kinda young, no offense. I think where your mom's coming from is that you said it in front of a couple who went through something hard as shit. It can be the hardest thing people go through. It sounds like she just thought you'd have a little more self awareness. Your mom is being a bit extra about it but your response is the kind of comment I'd probably just keep to myself in the future if I was in front of someone who just went through something as hard as IVF. There's just a time and place.

But there\u2019s no reason for you to have to keep relitigating it in your teens.", "Exactly, it\u2019s not like I said anything bad about kids. I love kids and I love my nephew, but sleepless nights and lack of freedom doesn\u2019t sound fun.", "Right? And also i find it very weird trying to push a 17 yo to have children, even if it is in the future. The last thing a teen is thinking about is having children.", "I don\u2019t understand it either. Especially considering I have 2 other adult siblings who want kids, so she\u2019ll get plenty of grandchildren.", "Mom wants a do over baby. I wonder if she has a good relationship with DIL. I'm guessing DIL isn't a doormat. OP, NTA at all. I've said since I was 10 years old I didn't want kids. I'm 33 and have two dogs. That's enough responsibility for me.", "I don\u2019t give a fuck about what my body is \u201cmade to do\u201d.

Her mum is TA for asking a question repeatedly and not liking it when she is given the same answer.", "That's a gross take. Just because someone's body can do something, doesn't mean they should or have to.", "Nonsense. Mum should not have asked the question in front of people who have fertility issue if she thought they might be offended. She is an adult and should have 'self awareness.'  She knew what the answer was likely to be as she's asked the question before. OP shouldn't have to lie so people wouldn't feel upset.  None of this is on OP.", "If only saying things like that would actually make her stop. She also body shames me all the time and I\u2019ve told her multiple times to stop because it hurts my feelings, but she doesn\u2019t", "I'm in the position of your brother, I'm 28f and pregnant with my first and my little sister 17f has always maintained she doesn't want kids. I've noticed my parents ramping up the \"you'll change your mind\" comments to her since we announced and she's stayed strong saying she doesn't want them in front of us. Let me tell you, the only people I consider AHish are my parents, I tell them to leave the poor girl alone! NTA OP :)", "Are you the only girl? \n\nOr are you the golden child? \n\nThat could be why she specifically wants them from you.", "The mom didn't ask a question, she made a comment about it. OP doesn't need to lie. She just needs to change the subject. This is about social skills in a certain time and place, not about OP being at fault. Yes the mom should also have more self awareness, but that's beside the point.", "Still not on OP.  Mum knew how she felt about kids. She shouldn't have made the comment if she didn't want OP to respond honestly. OP just didn't give in to her manipulative behaviour.", "Yeah I said she's NTA. And her mom sucks. Still a socially awkward comment that OP made in that setting. She can be the better person than her mom, and not fall into her manipulative traps."]}
