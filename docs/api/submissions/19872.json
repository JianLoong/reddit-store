I genuinely see no issue. Not everyone is required to want kids just because other people want them and sometimes struggle to have them.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't offended for them. She was using them as an excuse to get mad at you for calling out her BS. You are absolutely right. If it's such a touchy topic for them, why on Earth would she bring it up in front of them knowing you don't want to have kids? Also, I know tons of people, of all genders, who don't want children. Your mom is sorely misinformed about (for lack of a better word) breeding norms in humankind now.", "NTA.

It's becoming pretty normal to not want kids. My partner and I don't want children because we're both career oriented and we both very much enjoy our lifestyle, we go overseas twice a year, do weekend trips etc. (Something both my siblings and her sister are incredibly jealous of because they can't travel)\n\nI'm also very happy to be an uncle, baby sit my nephew and niece (I'm also her godfather).\n\nYour brother and SIL definitely aren't offended. Your mother is upset because she wants more grandchildren and obviously doesn't agree with your views that women can actually not want children.\n\nPlenty of men don't want children either. Don't let your mother make passive comments such as that and I would keep reaffirming your stance not wanting children.\n\nWho knows, in your 30s you may change your mind- but it's for you to change your mind, not your mother or any future partners to pressure you to do so.", "NTA - to thine own self be true", "NTA.

Even if you did want kids- 17 is NOT the right age to be thinking about it. \n\nMy mom does the exact same thing. When I was 20 I was really into going to the gym and my curves got bigger as a result. Well my mum said I was getting fat, and my fianc\u00e9 (don\u2019t have one) would think I was ugly if I couldn\u2019t even shed a few pounds (we use metric not imperial here) then I wouldn\u2019t be able to fit in my wedding dress (I haven\u2019t even bought it yet) \n\nMost of the time this comes from women who have lived their lives being pressured into the standards of others, and are jealous that you live in a time when you don\u2019t have to do that.

Yes the mom should also have more self awareness, but that's beside the point.", "Still not on OP.  Mum knew how she felt about kids. She shouldn't have made the comment if she didn't want OP to respond honestly. OP just didn't give in to her manipulative behaviour.", "Yeah I said she's NTA. And her mom sucks. Still a socially awkward comment that OP made in that setting. She can be the better person than her mom, and not fall into her manipulative traps.", "NTA. I have been vocal about not wanting kids for years. People first reaction is always, \"You hate kids?\" Or \"why don't you like kids?\" Which isn't the case at all. It seems pretty normal to most people that if you don't want kids you're some crazy person who hates kids and everyone who has them. Not wanting kids is a personal choice. The same as having them.", "NTA. Your SIL and mother pushed, knowing how you felt about having children. You respect and  celebrate their choices, but they are disregarding yours. They are the AHs.\n\nBeing childfree is just as valid as choosing to be a parent. And certainly a lot better than creating new humans just because other people say that \"you have to have kids\". \n\nIn my experience as a childfree woman approaching 40 with many friends and relatives who have children, it's always the ones don't seem very happy with their lives who try to convince me to join the club. The ones who are rocking parenthood also understand that it's not for everyone. They're the ones who respect other people's choices, and therefore respect their own children, which makes them better parents.", "NTA, Why is your mum obsessed with you having babies?", "NTA. Good lord. We need to stop getting offended when people make different life choices than us. Your brother and SIL are perfectly entitled to want a baby, take the steps to have the baby, be happy with their decision while also simultaneously respecting your right to make different choices for yourself. You, on the other hand, should also be perfectly entitled to make your own life decisions, while also being happy for your brother and his wife in theirs. Let me also give you an unsolicited word of advice. NEVER let anyone talk you into a child you don\u2019t want.", "NTA. Jesus your mom needs to take a chill pill. \n\nWhy is it that society believes everyone needs children to be happy and succeed in life. As a mother myself I would love my children to be happy and free and do what they want to do with their lives. I don\u2019t want them to be forced to have a baby to keep someone happy. That\u2019s just wrong. \n\nYou\u2019ll find the person for you - someone who has the same mindset at you. Just be truthful to who you are and stand firm on your beliefs. And if you one day think that you might want to have a child, that\u2019s also okay. But it\u2019s your choice. You are the one who makes your own story.", "NTA at all, not even a little bit. Your mother is a massive AH trying to force what she wants for your life on you. Don\u2019t fall for it. I lived this same hell - I was raised in a Catholic family where all women do is marry an awful man and breed. I\u2019m 39 now and no kids. I\u2019ve been saying I didn\u2019t want them since I was 5. Their fault for not listening. Stand your ground and say it loud and proud. Your brother and SIL won\u2019t have been offended in the slightest.", "Your mom is projecting. You were fine. NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhat your mom did was triangulation to manipulate you. First when you were holding the kid and then when you left and she called you rude. Both times she was using others to try and sway you. It's gonna suck because she is probably gonna use the grandkids to try and talk you into having kids. It wouldn't hurt to sit down with the BIL/SIL and give them room to express their emotions with you. Those with Infertility and those childless by choice usually have more in common than you would think and can be very supportive of one another. They could be very helpful at keeping mom at bay.", "NTA but it's a kindness not to talk about not wanting to have kids around people who have struggled to have them. If your mother says something like that again in front of people, just ignore it. You don't have to respond. Throughout your life you will encounter people desperate to have children who can' have them. You don't need to bring up that you don't want children in front of them. It's about talking about things appropriate to the situation at hand. If you're with people, like myself, who are childfree by choice, the have at it. Otherwise, just comment on how cute the kid is or say something more socially acceptable like \"don't hold your breath\" in a light hearted way.", "It\u2019s not a bad thing to state your position and unfortunately, your mother is ignoring what you\u2019re saying. \n\nShe\u2019s offended because she takes it as a form of rejection when you say you don\u2019t want to have kids.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWho tells a 17yo that they\u2019re gonna be a good mom?

I always reassure him that he don't.", "NTA I struggled to have my first 2 years it took lucky we fell just before the IVF process and now have 2 beautiful girls and honestly someone saying they don\u2019t want kids is not offensive. I think it\u2019s individual decision. As for men most men I\u2019ve ever spoken to never want kids it\u2019s more driven by the women some men really want kids but not all are bothered and some like yourself completely don\u2019t so the married comments a load of rubbish. \n\nYou are 17 why they putting so much pressure on you about kids. Enjoy being young and free.", "NTA. Honestly, the thing that made me the most pro-choice was having my own extremely wanted children. Pregnancy and parenthood are no joke, and they definitely should not be forced on anyone. If you don\u2019t want children, do not let anyone convince you to have them. Your want to be a parent likely will not change, and your children will always know it.", "NTA 42 year old, no kids, still haven\u2019t changed my mind.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t say anything hurtful. They also were successful at ivf, so it wasn\u2019t like you were flaunting not wanting to have a child while fertile in front of someone longing for a child.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL both went through so much to have a child because that's what they wanted. The fact that they didn't take offense shows that they have enough empathy to understand that just because they want something doesn't mean everyone else does or should want it too. \n\nIt seems like your mother only wants you to have kids because she wants you to conform to society's expectations of your gender and sees reproducing as being part of that. The reason I come to this conclusion is because your brother just gave her a grandchild, and because she specifically cited desirability to male suitors as a reason for you to want children. (FYI, if you do want to marry a man, there are plenty of childfree men out there).", "NTA. Your mother is still trying to guilt you into having kids. She should be patient and wait to see what you do with your life. Some people your age may say 'I'm never having kids' then end up having kids. You may change your mind yet, but not if she keeps pushing. All she is doing is making sure you stick to your word.\n\nDon't get me wrong with this comment. Not saying you will change your mind, just that it is a possabily whilst you are young. Live your life as you want, not how your mother wants you to live it.", "NTA\n\nShe asked. So she got an answer. It shouldn't hurt other people that you dont want kids. It sucks they had to go through so much trouble, but that situatjob isn't connected to yours and therefore they shouldn't feel bad if you don't want kids. \n\nAnd for the love of God I hope your mother stops asking cause coming from someone who also doesn't want kids, the constant asking is annoying", "Nope definitely NTA. I have 2 kids and my sister doesn\u2019t and will not have any. Your mom is being a shit stirrer.", "NTA\n\nMy wife and I are happily child free.\n\nYou said nothing judgmental or rude. You were honest, your mom is the A", "19F here. I have mentioned, in front of my cousins who have kids, that I don't want to have kids, while holding their kids.

You\u2019re 17. Your objective is to discover the world, get an education, travel, make friends and meet people. \n\nWhy is your mother pushing the baby agenda so hard for a teenager? You might change your mind and you may not. But her mindset is weird.", "NTA, you are 17, and have a whole life of experiences in front of you. Your brother is in a very different place and obviously delighted with their healthy baby.  You may change your mind one day, that\u2019s ok. You may continue to feel this way, enjoying your nieces and nephews but not wanting to do that yourself, and that\u2019s ok. You may decide to adopt - also ok!\n\nAt 17 there is so much ahead of you! Your mom is a different generation, she has kids she loves - and wants that for you I guess. That\u2019s ok, but she shouldn\u2019t push that on you.  \n\nMy daughter is 17, is on a contraceptive implant and starting an engineering apprenticeship- she doesn\u2019t want babies either!!  She is a wonderful person and would make a great mom - IF THAT IS WHAT SHE CHOOSES! It isn\u2019t my decision, my role is to support her in what she wants", "NTA. Your mum knew better than to play \"fuck around, find out\" but still did it anyway thinking she could change your mind and got embarrassed by her mistake when you put her in her place.", "NTA. You can like kids and still not want any. Also, your mother now has a grandchild, isn't she being too greedy lol", "NTA, you not wanting isn't the reason some people have a hard time having some. It's not related at all and will never be. Your mom is just pressuring you and it's completely inappropriate, maybe you'll change your mind, maybe you will not and at the end it's your life. \nAlso, finding a husband and having kids isn't the happiness recipe for life, especially when it comes from social pressure.", "I've never wanted kids - and my family has pretty much always known that. And honestly it's a win for all of us. I love the hell out of my nephews, spoil them, and give them back. My sis and her husband get free babysitting, and the boys have more adults that love them and look out for them (and buy them cool dinosaur toys).", "NTA, I am almost 40 and I have known since I was about 15 that I don't want children.\n\nIn this case your Mother brought it up, and you simply pointed out something she should have already known.", "You\u2019re 17. This shouldn\u2019t even be a topic of conversation.", "NTA, saying you don't personally want kids should not offend your brother and his wife. It's not like you said anyone who has kids is an idiot or something like that.", "\"you have to have kids\" \ud83e\udd2e NTA", "r/childfree NTA", "Your mom is pushing you to have kids, but you are still a kid yourself......\n\nNo offense to you. \n\nBut you are only 17. Having a kid should not be on your radar. And your mom pushing it so much at such a young age is honestly a little weird. \n\nBut she mey be right, you will change your mind. Or you wont. Either way, that is up to you, years from now.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nYou've told them, they know. You don't owe anyone kids - not your mother, not the world. I didn't struggle with infertility but I did with miscarriages and I would never be offended if someone said they didn't want kids. \n\nI have many, many friends who said when we were teens that they didn't want kids. Now we are nearing our 40's and they are still very happy with their decision. They have healthy relationships and are living the life they wanted. You can still be successful and live a very happy life childfree.", "NTA,\n\nSounds like she was just sad her plan didn't work and hoped how sight of a new born baby didn't do the trick to change your mind. (AS IF this would be a go-to cure for \"hell-no-no-kids-for-me-itis\")  \n\n\nofcourse, that's HER problem. I'm sad people still think ***all*** adults would want to have kids someday.   \nI would have less contact with your mom.", "NTA\n\nYour brother and SIL really have nothing to do with this. The beef is entirely with your mom who seems upset you want have kids. You simply stated your opinion in a calm way. You didn't say anything rude", "NTA - it is not offensive to people who have children that you don't want one (or at least it shouldn't be!) \n\nJust as a heads up, youre probably going to be having this conversation with your mother for the next 20 years. \n\nPeople who have kids just can't understand when someone else doesn't, especially when women don't.\n\nTo be fair, you are young and you might change her mind, but it's worrying she's pushing it now when you arent even an adult. \n\nThere are plenty of valid options on life other than traditional family and it's genuinely none of her business what you want.", "You're 17.  Why would you want kids now.  Maybe you will want them when you're 25 or 30 but for now you are NTA", "NTA\n\nEven IF it's true you might change your mind someday, at this moment in time you do not want them. There's absolutely nothing offensive about that.", "NTA because your family seems to be honest with one another. However, it would be nice to send text to your brother and SIL and just clarify - saying that you\u2019re stoked for their little one and your comment was made directly to your guys\u2019 mom who has been oddly pestering you about kids and it wasn\u2019t ok to make the comment she made. Your mom is doing what lots of moms  do - and it\u2019s not ok. You can always write your mom a letter and explain that you\u2019re really upset by her continued comments and that you would like her to at minimum work on not saying things to you about having children.", "INFO: were your SIL or brother the slightest bit upset? Were you making mean faces at the baby and calling him names?\n\nMy best friend is pregnant with her second and I\u2019ve had to stop mentioning not having kids because it always starts with her yelling \u201cDON\u2019T\u201d and leads into her working herself up about how absolutely miserable pregnancy is and she can\u2019t believe anyone would do this to themselves if they weren\u2019t absolutely ecstatic to have children. For the record she is a fantastic Mom.", "I think the real AH is your mother.\n\n\nIt's fine to not want kids. It will most certainly make the chances of finding a partner smaller as most people indeed want to have kids, but you still have chances.\n\n\n\nAlso, in case you are considering for tubal ligation surgery (which is what I would suggest for women who absolutely do not want children) wait a few years for 1) to be completely independent, and 2) to be sure 100% as it is a surgical procedure that has extremely low chances of being reversed due to the position of the organs.\n\nAlso, avoid sex as even with sterilization surgery, pregnancy could still happen (if there was an error during surgery for example).\n\n\nYou are NTA. Just ignore what your mother says. Some people are just like that.\n\nJust be happy that you are an aunt even if you never become a mom.", "NTA - It is A-OK to not want kids and be honest about it in this situation. Sounds like you'll be a great aunt, too!  \n\nThe only way I think it's mildly offensive is when people say \"No offense, I just would never want kids.\" Somehow, that usually comes across just as hell.", "Sane people with kids aren\u2019t offended because other people prefer not to have kids. NTA.", "Exactly. OP's mom just wants grandkids but it's not mom's call. NTA OP", "Seriously. As a child free person, I hate the stereotype that mom is throwing out. I love lids. They're fun. I can change a diaper and babysit in a pinch. I just don't want kids of my own. I want to spoilt noeces and nephews and friends kids with the loudest toys possible and know that because I love them and they love me, their kids are safe with me. Mom is being a weirdo.", "Yep 33 year old man here. Been single since I was 18 and have no desire for a relationship or kids. It frustrates the hell out of me that people (i.e. my parents and work colleagues) act like this is wrong and they are worried about me. I do not get it, I'm perfectly content with my life at the moment, but apparently bring single and child free is wrong. Urgh people suck sometimes.", "I was thinking this as a parent of a near 15 year old. Why are they pressuring her already about having kids?", "That\u2019s exactly how I feel. I even told them I\u2019d love to babysit my nephew anytime. I enjoy being around children, I just wouldn\u2019t want to have to take care of one 24/7.", "I have said I didn't want kids ever since I was a kid. Plenty of people told me I'd change my mind by 25 then by 30. I'm 33 and I still 100% do not want kids. I've never been pregnant and I never will be. I. Don't. Want. Kids. Luckily my fiance doesn't want them either. Some people just don't want to and that's completely ok. The earth is over populated anyways. It is very AHish of you to make that comment about her body being made to carry and have kids. That's a disgusting mentality. Women are more than just wombs. We are people too, who have our own personalities and ideologies. Not everyone is the same. Not everyone wants them. Nothing wrong with it but there is something wrong with you telling a woman she will change her mind, after all your body is made for it. That's gross on so many levels. \n\nAlso people with fertility issues who hate people who do not want kids are projecting their problems onto other people. That isn't the other person's fault. The people with fertility issues need to work on themselves and figure out their issues instead of projecting it onto other people.", "She has told her mom she doesn't want kids. You don't have to accept an unwanted complement from someone. Especially when it would seem that the mother is just trying to browbeat OP into agreeing, anything other than a dismissal could be seen as approval.", "Why only for now?\n\nIf OP said they same thing at 25 or 30, they would still be NTA", "I would go full-on with your mom about this one. \u201c24/7 caregiver responsibilities that include wiping a dirty ass, cleaning up vomit, paying for everything they need, and doing it all unpaid? What sane person is signing up for *that* job?\u201d\n\n(Spoiler alert: I have two kids whom I love more than life itself. \ud83d\ude01 This doesn\u2019t change the fact that it\u2019s a crazy job that - on paper - seems like the worst opportunity in the world.)", "I have 3 siblings, all of whom have or want kids. I\u2019m extremely open with them about not wanting any myself, and they do not care whatsoever.", "Also having a niece or nephew is fun. You get to do all the fun aunt stuff and then send them home afterwards to be their parents' problem", "I don\u2019t have kids and I\u2019m a rockstar aunt. It\u2019s actually rather priceless to have another family member, an adult that can be trust almost like a third parent. You\u2019re m9m has issues. I\u2019m going to assume she hasn\u2019t taught you boundaries. You\u2019re going to need to learn quick, since you\u2019re almost an adult. Otherwise she\u2019s going to just keep steamrolling you the rest of your life.", "You did nothing wrong. My grandparents still bring up me having kids. I'm in my 30s and I have stated my no kids since I was in my teens. I'm at awesome Aunt. You be the awesome one too", "No offense but at 17 you've probably got your hands full trying to take care of yourself. At least I did at that age.", "Start telling your regular doctor now that you don't want kids and keep telling them once a year. If in the future you're still sure and want your tubes tied/removed, there'll be a record of you always being sure it's a hell no.\nIt greatly helped me, by the time I was old enough to get it removed they all knew yeah we saw this coming", "I\u2019m not saying she has to. I\u2019m just saying that humans and every other organism typically have get the urge to reproduce eventually, considering that\u2019s what they\u2019re made to do.", "you are a godsend! i do not want kids, but every cousin & my SIL have ALL made comments about me not being serious. one cousin, who is only a year older than me, even said \"when your biological clock kicks in you'll change your mind so fast\". unfortunately there are a lot of people who still believe that a person's ultimate happiness in life hinges on whether or not they have children.", "I have no kids, but I most certainly would love to do all that you listed that a parent should do for them + more lol \n\nKids are great. \n\nSome people do not want to have kids and that is okay. Sterilization surgery and avoidance from sex are important for these people.\n\nSome people want to have their own kids and that is okay.\n\nSome people do not want to have their own, and to instead adopt.", "I\u2019m neither", "Even if we\u2019re talking evolutionarily that\u2019s not necessarily true. Humans are a social species, meaning it\u2019s a lot easier for us to ensure our genes get passed on without reproducing ourselves. By keeping our siblings\u2019 kids alive and not making more, our genes are passed on and there isn\u2019t an increased strain on resources. \n\nThat\u2019s also likely/partially why women (and female elephants) go through menopause, it takes less resources to care for grandkids/nieces/nephews than it does to keep making a bunch of kids and hoping some of \u2018em make it."]}
