I genuinely see no issue. Not everyone is required to want kids just because other people want them and sometimes struggle to have them.", "NTA\n\nShe wasn't offended for them. She was using them as an excuse to get mad at you for calling out her BS. You are absolutely right. If it's such a touchy topic for them, why on Earth would she bring it up in front of them knowing you don't want to have kids? Also, I know tons of people, of all genders, who don't want children. Your mom is sorely misinformed about (for lack of a better word) breeding norms in humankind now.", "NTA.

It's becoming pretty normal to not want kids. My partner and I don't want children because we're both career oriented and we both very much enjoy our lifestyle, we go overseas twice a year, do weekend trips etc. (Something both my siblings and her sister are incredibly jealous of because they can't travel)\n\nI'm also very happy to be an uncle, baby sit my nephew and niece (I'm also her godfather).\n\nYour brother and SIL definitely aren't offended. Your mother is upset because she wants more grandchildren and obviously doesn't agree with your views that women can actually not want children.\n\nPlenty of men don't want children either. Don't let your mother make passive comments such as that and I would keep reaffirming your stance not wanting children.\n\nWho knows, in your 30s you may change your mind- but it's for you to change your mind, not your mother or any future partners to pressure you to do so.", "NTA - to thine own self be true", "NTA.

Even if you did want kids- 17 is NOT the right age to be thinking about it. \n\nMy mom does the exact same thing. When I was 20 I was really into going to the gym and my curves got bigger as a result. Well my mum said I was getting fat, and my fianc\u00e9 (don\u2019t have one) would think I was ugly if I couldn\u2019t even shed a few pounds (we use metric not imperial here) then I wouldn\u2019t be able to fit in my wedding dress (I haven\u2019t even bought it yet) \n\nMost of the time this comes from women who have lived their lives being pressured into the standards of others, and are jealous that you live in a time when you don\u2019t have to do that.

Yes the mom should also have more self awareness, but that's beside the point.", "Still not on OP.  Mum knew how she felt about kids. She shouldn't have made the comment if she didn't want OP to respond honestly. OP just didn't give in to her manipulative behaviour.", "Yeah I said she's NTA. And her mom sucks. Still a socially awkward comment that OP made in that setting. She can be the better person than her mom, and not fall into her manipulative traps.", "NTA. I have been vocal about not wanting kids for years. People first reaction is always, \"You hate kids?\" Or \"why don't you like kids?\" Which isn't the case at all. It seems pretty normal to most people that if you don't want kids you're some crazy person who hates kids and everyone who has them. Not wanting kids is a personal choice. The same as having them.", "NTA. Your SIL and mother pushed, knowing how you felt about having children. You respect and  celebrate their choices, but they are disregarding yours. They are the AHs.\n\nBeing childfree is just as valid as choosing to be a parent. And certainly a lot better than creating new humans just because other people say that \"you have to have kids\". \n\nIn my experience as a childfree woman approaching 40 with many friends and relatives who have children, it's always the ones don't seem very happy with their lives who try to convince me to join the club. The ones who are rocking parenthood also understand that it's not for everyone. They're the ones who respect other people's choices, and therefore respect their own children, which makes them better parents.", "NTA, Why is your mum obsessed with you having babies?", "NTA. Good lord. We need to stop getting offended when people make different life choices than us. Your brother and SIL are perfectly entitled to want a baby, take the steps to have the baby, be happy with their decision while also simultaneously respecting your right to make different choices for yourself. You, on the other hand, should also be perfectly entitled to make your own life decisions, while also being happy for your brother and his wife in theirs. Let me also give you an unsolicited word of advice. NEVER let anyone talk you into a child you don\u2019t want.", "NTA. Jesus your mom needs to take a chill pill. \n\nWhy is it that society believes everyone needs children to be happy and succeed in life. As a mother myself I would love my children to be happy and free and do what they want to do with their lives. I don\u2019t want them to be forced to have a baby to keep someone happy. That\u2019s just wrong. \n\nYou\u2019ll find the person for you - someone who has the same mindset at you. Just be truthful to who you are and stand firm on your beliefs. And if you one day think that you might want to have a child, that\u2019s also okay. But it\u2019s your choice. You are the one who makes your own story.", "NTA at all, not even a little bit. Your mother is a massive AH trying to force what she wants for your life on you. Don\u2019t fall for it. I lived this same hell - I was raised in a Catholic family where all women do is marry an awful man and breed. I\u2019m 39 now and no kids. I\u2019ve been saying I didn\u2019t want them since I was 5. Their fault for not listening. Stand your ground and say it loud and proud. Your brother and SIL won\u2019t have been offended in the slightest.", "Your mom is projecting. You were fine. NTA.", "NTA\n\nWhat your mom did was triangulation to manipulate you. First when you were holding the kid and then when you left and she called you rude. Both times she was using others to try and sway you. It's gonna suck because she is probably gonna use the grandkids to try and talk you into having kids. It wouldn't hurt to sit down with the BIL/SIL and give them room to express their emotions with you. Those with Infertility and those childless by choice usually have more in common than you would think and can be very supportive of one another. They could be very helpful at keeping mom at bay.", "NTA but it's a kindness not to talk about not wanting to have kids around people who have struggled to have them. If your mother says something like that again in front of people, just ignore it. You don't have to respond. Throughout your life you will encounter people desperate to have children who can' have them. You don't need to bring up that you don't want children in front of them. It's about talking about things appropriate to the situation at hand. If you're with people, like myself, who are childfree by choice, the have at it. Otherwise, just comment on how cute the kid is or say something more socially acceptable like \"don't hold your breath\" in a light hearted way.", "It\u2019s not a bad thing to state your position and unfortunately, your mother is ignoring what you\u2019re saying. \n\nShe\u2019s offended because she takes it as a form of rejection when you say you don\u2019t want to have kids.\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nWho tells a 17yo that they\u2019re gonna be a good mom?

I always reassure him that he don't.", "NTA I struggled to have my first 2 years it took lucky we fell just before the IVF process and now have 2 beautiful girls and honestly someone saying they don\u2019t want kids is not offensive. I think it\u2019s individual decision. As for men most men I\u2019ve ever spoken to never want kids it\u2019s more driven by the women some men really want kids but not all are bothered and some like yourself completely don\u2019t so the married comments a load of rubbish. \n\nYou are 17 why they putting so much pressure on you about kids. Enjoy being young and free.", "NTA. Honestly, the thing that made me the most pro-choice was having my own extremely wanted children. Pregnancy and parenthood are no joke, and they definitely should not be forced on anyone. If you don\u2019t want children, do not let anyone convince you to have them. Your want to be a parent likely will not change, and your children will always know it.", "NTA 42 year old, no kids, still haven\u2019t changed my mind.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t say anything hurtful. They also were successful at ivf, so it wasn\u2019t like you were flaunting not wanting to have a child while fertile in front of someone longing for a child.", "NTA. Your brother and SIL both went through so much to have a child because that's what they wanted. The fact that they didn't take offense shows that they have enough empathy to understand that just because they want something doesn't mean everyone else does or should want it too. \n\nIt seems like your mother only wants you to have kids because she wants you to conform to society's expectations of your gender and sees reproducing as being part of that. The reason I come to this conclusion is because your brother just gave her a grandchild, and because she specifically cited desirability to male suitors as a reason for you to want children. (FYI, if you do want to marry a man, there are plenty of childfree men out there).", "NTA. Your mother is still trying to guilt you into having kids. She should be patient and wait to see what you do with your life. Some people your age may say 'I'm never having kids' then end up having kids. You may change your mind yet, but not if she keeps pushing. All she is doing is making sure you stick to your word.\n\nDon't get me wrong with this comment. Not saying you will change your mind, just that it is a possabily whilst you are young. Live your life as you want, not how your mother wants you to live it.", "NTA\n\nShe asked. So she got an answer. It shouldn't hurt other people that you dont want kids. It sucks they had to go through so much trouble, but that situatjob isn't connected to yours and therefore they shouldn't feel bad if you don't want kids. \n\nAnd for the love of God I hope your mother stops asking cause coming from someone who also doesn't want kids, the constant asking is annoying", "Nope definitely NTA. I have 2 kids and my sister doesn\u2019t and will not have any. Your mom is being a shit stirrer.", "NTA\n\nMy wife and I are happily child free.\n\nYou said nothing judgmental or rude. You were honest, your mom is the A", "19F here. I have mentioned, in front of my cousins who have kids, that I don't want to have kids, while holding their kids.

You\u2019re 17. Your objective is to discover the world, get an education, travel, make friends and meet people. \n\nWhy is your mother pushing the baby agenda so hard for a teenager? You might change your mind and you may not. But her mindset is weird.", "NTA, you are 17, and have a whole life of experiences in front of you. Your brother is in a very different place and obviously delighted with their healthy baby.  You may change your mind one day, that\u2019s ok. You may continue to feel this way, enjoying your nieces and nephews but not wanting to do that yourself, and that\u2019s ok. You may decide to adopt - also ok!\n\nAt 17 there is so much ahead of you! Your mom is a different generation, she has kids she loves - and wants that for you I guess. That\u2019s ok, but she shouldn\u2019t push that on you.  \n\nMy daughter is 17, is on a contraceptive implant and starting an engineering apprenticeship- she doesn\u2019t want babies either!!  She is a wonderful person and would make a great mom - IF THAT IS WHAT SHE CHOOSES! It isn\u2019t my decision, my role is to support her in what she wants", "NTA. Your mum knew better than to play \"fuck around, find out\" but still did it anyway thinking she could change your mind and got embarrassed by her mistake when you put her in her place.", "NTA. You can like kids and still not want any. Also, your mother now has a grandchild, isn't she being too greedy lol", "NTA, you not wanting isn't the reason some people have a hard time having some.
