My gf has asked me to sleep on the sofa whilst he's visiting, so that he can sleep in my spot next to her. Yes, she will be sleeping in the bed next to him.\n\nApparently it's normal in her family. She is Dutch so maybe it's normal in NL? We live in the UK and I grew up always intuitively knowing that a couple's bedroom, and especially their bed, is a very private place, and inviting anyone else to sleep there is to be avoided. There are exceptions such as offering for an older parent or even kids.\n\nIn my opinion, her fit, healthy, 18 yr old brother can sleep on the couch, not in my (but more importantly our) bed, and especially not with my girlfriend there. Of course I know there wouldn't be anything sexual of course not, but it still feels like it would be an intrusion into our relationship. I'm more shocked than annoyed at my gf about this. I've explained that such a thing would be feel like she was disrespecting my role as her partner by violating that privacy. After a brief heated conversation, she begrudging said she would try and borrow our flatmate's air matress. Again I'm still shocked she was willing to offer my place in bed with her before any alternatives such as this.\n\n\n\nFor context, it's important to note that my gf and I are actually in the process of breaking up. This is besides the point but I thought I should mention it. It's an completely amicable breakup, a joint decision so that we can both do the things we need to in life whilst we are still young - in fact we are separating now so that our relationship isn't damaged, and we can potentially pick it up again in the future.\n\nWe decided to stay together until I move out (will be after her brother visits), in order to avoid going through the breakup whilst still living together, as this would turn our friendship sour. We are actually still in love, and get on very well usually, which makes this scenario even more tricky.\n\nHer asking me to sleep on the coach, however, seems not to be motivated at all by our planned-seperation, and entirely by her brother.\n\nShe claimed to have asked me about her brother sleeping in the bed previously, and that I agreed in passing. Although I don't remember this, it may be true. Most likely because I didn't fully understand at the time, because I wouldn't have thought she would even ask such a thing.\n\nAs an extra kick in the teeth, this argument about her brother staying happened today on what should be our 2nd anniversary. \n\nAnyway, AITA?\n\n\n\nEDIT:\nI asked my gf and she said it's nothing to do with our relationship, it's because she thought it was the right thing to do and I would want to offer anyway??\n\nI'm not sure if her brother is aware of her idea for sleeping arrangements. He is a nice guy and I get on well with all of her family.\n\nMy gf has always been close with her brothers growing up, and she said they shared hotel rooms and stuff, which is normal as kids, but after puberty it's weird, and I think that's how most people see it.\nI told her I was concerned she didn't see how that was weird, and she accused me of calling her a perv.\n\nI would move out now if I could, but I moved a long way to live with my gf, meaning I don't have any family or close friends I could move to for the meantime.

Sleeping in the same bed as your siblings (especially opposite gender) is not normal in The Netherlands.", "Presumably, because the brother is visiting? I doubt the couch will fit two sleeping adults. I suppose the brother could bunk with OP.\n\nDo we even know if OP and his ex even sleep in the same bed together on the regular now?", "If her brother is coming over, it makes more sense for OP to move to the couch rather than to share his bed with her brother.", "Why\u2019s it always the guy that has to make the sacrifices.", "That's depends on who owns the bed and who pays more for the housing. It sounds like OP pays the bills and probably owns the bed, so she can be thankful he didn't tell her to leave immediately and keep his stuff and place for himself.", "I find it hilarious that people are weirded out by literally siblings sleeping a night on the same bed, but then they are Suggesting OP instead to sleep with his soon to be exes brother as if that was less weird.", "Still not a reason that OP has to move from his bed, because her guest. She invited her brother, which should not effect OPs sleeping arrangement. \n\nThe brother sleeps on the couch or the floor, op shouldn\u2019t have to sacrifice any comfort for his girlfriends weird incest desires.", "To be fair, I wasn't serious about that suggestion haha I mean, I'd sooner my partner slept in the same bed as their sibling instead of me sleeping in the same bed as them haha", "The argument stems from OP mindlessly agreeing prior then changing his mind. It's not about him being force to do anything.\n\n>weird incest desires.\n\nA massive stretch given the situation as a whole.", "YTA\n\n1) break up properly and stop trying to be in your ex\u2019s space. You don\u2019t have any entitlement to her personal space anymore. \n\n2) there\u2019s no way you\u2019d be this pressed if it was her sister, so you\u2019re the one being weird about this, since she\u2019s about as likely to fuck her brother as she would be to fuck a sister.", "It's the breakup, not the brother, that's removing you from her bed", "Sweet home ~~Alabama~~ Gelderland!\n\n\nNTA, super weird and creepy.", "How confident are you that they really are related? Lol NTA", "Wish I was as confident as you about the lack of sexual activity between them. NTA", "Dude, just go sleep on the couch until you've moved out.  She doesn't want to have to say it... sorry.", "Awkward. Tell her she can take the couch and you and her brother will have the sleepover in the bed. Turn the awkwardness up to 11.", "NTA if this was really about you getting kicked out of your own bed for a guest, but this situation is much more bizarre than the question being asked. You're just deciding to stay together until you can move out? This isn't a real relationship.", "I'm the child of Dutch immigrants and I (45F) did share a bed with my younger brother growing up- until I was 8 and he was 6. That was because we were the youngest of 7 kids: 3 boys who shared a room, 2 girls who shared a room, then a 6 year gap before me and my younger brother.  As soon as they could, my parents bought a bigger house and my brother and I each got our own room, because even in a broke-as-shit household with too many kids, my parents recognized that girls and boys sharing a bedroom was the last possible resort.", "NTA\n\nYour bed is not hers to offer. Nothing else matters here.\n\nAs for the whole sharing the bed thing. I'm not Dutch, but I'm from elsewhere in EU and have heard of more than one case people doing this during family visits. The rule of thumb is if you would share a tent with them while camping, you would probably not find it weird to spend a weekend in their king-size bed, if there is nowhere else to put you. But even in that arrangement I have never heard about couples being separated.\n\nBut that being said, I have to re-iterate that this bears no influence on her being the AH to offer your bed to someone else, and have the audacity to feel annoyed by you having a problem with that.", "NTA", "Sharing a bed with your sibling while on a trip isn\u2019t weird to me bc I grew up doing it. Kicked your significant other out of bed so you can let your sibling sleep next to you instead of on your couch is absolutely weird. NTA", "Im mexican and while i usually share a bed with my mom/sibling when we travel I've never heard of breaking up a couple for sleeping arrangements. Like if we had more then one guest over my mom would bunk with one of us and offer her room... I've never heard of this before", "NTA. This is so weird to me and I was trying to be culturally-friendly in my reply until I saw other Dutch people explaining that it\u2019s not normal for them despite her claim that it was. Adult siblings being that close has always creeped me out so I wasn\u2019t sure if I was biased or not.\n\nThe ONLY thing that I can think of that would make this less weird is if her concern was him being uncomfortable on the couch since you guys have a flat mate, but even then it would be an air mattress on the bedroom floor for him, not laying in bed next to me. Gross. He needs to just suck it up and enjoy the free stay on the couch. Also your girlfriend is a weirdo.", "NTA. paddle faster, I think I hear banjos.", "NTA\u2026this is beyond weird..", "If she wants to displace you in your bed for her brother, tell her you\u2019d be happy to stay the night in a 5 star hotel (that she pays for).", "NTA. Im American but that\u2019s weird", "NTA \n\nMy bedroom is my private space. Period", "NTA. If you are still paying half the rent, you are entitled to your bed.  Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re in the midst of breaking up", "YTA. She\u2019s prepping you for when she has her other brother she met at the bar stay in your bed.", "NTA tell her she can sleep on the couch, and he can sleep next to you.", "I'm Belgian and if this was a thing in NL, we'd have endless jokes about it.\n\nNTA", "I am Dutch as well and it is no big deal imo. In this situation I think the GF should sleep on the couch\ud83e\udd23. It is also weird to wait the breaking up thing untill someone moves out though.", "I'm Dutch as well, if needed I wouldn't mind sleeping in bed with one of my adult siblings, but not if that's normally where one of their partners sleep, that is a little weird.", "Even further - they're in the process of becoming exes. They're only still living together bc OP hasn't moved out yet.", "Given that he's moving out, I kinda wonder if ex-GF invited brother over to try to give him the ole heave-ho, since OP doesn't see to be too quick to leave.", "Mhe, i am in a similar situation.. asked stb-ex to move out, but she got a hard time finding a new location.\n\nNo fucking way i am going to sleep downstairs , she can sleep wherever she wants to tho.\nShe picks the bed for now.\n\n( context, i own the place )", "I mean, it's not a \"marital\" bed. They've broken up, he's just not moved out yet.", "Right? OP seems a little delusional. Maybe ex-GF invited brother over to try to finally get OP to leave.", "I mean i (male) have often shared a bed with my brother on vacations when we were adults but that was when there was no other option. And the second one of our GF\u2019s was near one of us slept on the coach or on the floor.\n\nIts really fucking weird to kick your partner to the coach/ground so you can lay next to your sibling.", "You guys would be to dumb to figur them out.\n\n\n... \n\nwe would be to cheap to buy the paper it is written on ;p", "I\u2019ve smoked a Dutch before. NTA", "Because it's all her property?", "People here are saying that it's her property.", "He's moving out, so presumably it's her place and she's letting him stay while he does this prolonged exit.", "Because he's moving out, and it's her brother visiting. If it was his sister, then I'd say exgf should take the couch and he should be allowed the bed with his sister. Everyone trying to make it about gender but it's an intimacy issue, and whoever's going to have family present should be able to spend that time feeling safe and comfortable.\n\nIt's not her fault he's got no one to call on, fucked up though it is to say.\n\nEdit: Clarifications.", "were you and your ex also talking about how you would for sure pick the relationship up later? better yet, when you were breaking up, did you accuse your ex\u2019s family of disrespecting your relationship? apples and oranges. there\u2019s a mature way to do it, if you\u2019re very careful, but this ain\u2019t it.", "They're staying together until they move out so they have not broken up yet.", "And if OP is moving out presumable it is already or will become her place, so it makes sense she keeps her room, rather than it goes their room -> his room -> her room??", "Also a good point, but I think bringing who pays the rent into it diminishes the fact that this is about the emotional rollercoaster that is breaking up, and how fucked up it is to be made to sleep in bed with your ex because he's butthurt about a place in the bed he gave up on.", "Because \"walk it off and provide\".  Wasn't emotion and expectation beaten out of you like the rest of us?  You must have missed everything before 1997. \ud83d\ude43", "He said he's moving out, which would indicate that it's her place though.", "I\u2019m a girl. So no."]}
