He\u2019d never call to say what was happening and we couldn\u2019t go anywhere whilst they were with us because we only had one car and it wouldn\u2019t fit all of us in.

Nope!  You are under no such obligation.  You have an infant and a normal, responsible adult life.  It won't work.\n\nSuggest that your parents take over as your niece's childcare.

What if something had happened or your niece fell ill? \n\nTell your parents that they are more than welcome to look after your niece - their GRANDAUGHTER - and help your sister out, but you owe her nothing and will not be helping in anyway until your sister treats you with some respect and honesty.", "NTA your parents can babysit!", "NTA. I would set boundaries now, because this dynamic will only get worse and encroach on your personal life. Example: My older sister had 4 kids, 7 with step children. I worked for my dad for over 10 years, and almost every day I had to go pick up her kids, watch them, and so on. When she was dating, I had to watch her kids while she went out, but the constant favors were never reciprocated. If I said I have a life too, I would get yelled at. My husband and kids moved and one reason was to get away from everyone. You are not her free babysitter, she needs to grow up and be a parent. I get it, we all want to be free and do what we want, but when you have a little, they should take priority.", "NTA \n\nShe can have a night put once in a while, nothing wrong with that. But she needs to tell you beforehand instaed of telling you she's going to a dinner and then can't be reached throughout the evening, only coming up the morning after like nothing happened. \n\nAlso, your parents could easily be the ones watching over their grandkid to let their daughter enjoy \"one dinner\". I'm sure they'll change idea on who's right or wrong.", "INFO: does she know she could have gone to jail for abandoning her child like that?", "NTA.  Your parents need to stop enabling her bad behavior and tell her to step up as a parent.  It's not up to you to step up and they  need to understand that.  Tell them all the guilt tripping will not sway you and to stop.  If they try to argue that she's still young, so are you because you both are not that far apart.  You would like to party too.  Could they watch your kid?  Of course they won't.  Tell them to tell their daughter to grow up.", "NTA for suuuure", "NTA. I feel bad for your niece, I bet she was scared not knowing where her mum was.", "NTA\n \n\n\nYour parents are available if they feel so strongly about it. You are not your nieces mother nor is she your responsibility. You are not her baby sitter on demand. She needs to learn how to be a responsible parent not learn how to side step her responsibilities.", "If she pulled a stunt like that with a sitter, that person would be well within their rights to call the police about child abandonment. She was taking advantage of you and expected you to be okay with it. NTA", "NTA tell your sister and parents if she leaves her kid with you again you'll ring the police for child abandonment.", "NTA She should have been honest with you and just asked you to watch her overnight. \n\nI will say, it\u2019s a bit assholeish if you to judge your sister for wanting a night off to party. Like it\u2019s okay for moms to take a break every once in awhile. The issue is that she lied about it to force you into watching her kid overnight instead of being honest and letting you make an informed decision.", "if u think she didn't tell them the whole truth, why didn't you tell them? but even if they do know the whole truth and feel this way, it doesn't matter. they only feel this way because if you don't babysit, your sister will ask your parents instead. so instead of them telling her no and calling her out on her behavior, they want you to just be a nice little doormat for your sister. fuck that.\n\nnta. and don't let your parents or anyone convince you otherwise.", "NTA but I'd tell your parents \"I never said I wouldn't watch niece overnight. I never got a chance to say yes or no since sister lied to me and told me she needed a few hours babysitting for a dinner, not overnight babysitting for a party. I'm not willing to go to that kind of effort for someone who lies to manipulate me. If I can't trust sister to stick to what we agree when she asks for babysitting, I can't babysit.\"", "NTAH\n\nYour sister knew what she was doing. Who doesn't take the phone call from the person watching your kid? Could have been an emergency.\n\nShe wanted that night out so bad that she did not give a fuck about you or her kid. She' young, I get it, but she should have asked you for the sleep over, you might have done it. Now she has to face the consequence of her actions. Hope it was worth it.", "NTA. I agree, your sister told them a half-truth where she's the victim. She told you a few hours and lied, abandoning her child with you. You would have been within your rights to have the police take your niece for being abandoned. If she had been honest up front you may have been ok with the overnight stay. Let your parents know your side and if they continue to call you the bad guy tell them \"I'll happily tell my sister you are offering to take your granddaughter on short notice overnight.\" Let your parents sputter over those apples. You set a boundary with your sister. Good for you.", "NTA. Next time call CPS for child abandonment.", "I mean, isn't it alright to ask for babysit overnight, and being honest that you'd like a night out to party? I feel like it should be alright once in a while. This way is abandoning and not ok.", "and that she lied to you about going out for dinner but instead went to a party.  Somehow I doubt she fell asleep at midnight at home.  Why wouldn't she swing by and pick up daughter first then go home.", "This, 1000%", "Op would have been in rights to call the police and have the child put in foster care overnight. Nta.  Why is she expected to be her sister's unpaid nanny anyways?", "Warn the sister  that if you see something  like this again you  ll call the police  for abandonment.  (Assuming  you actually  agree  at some point  to babysit  again). Nta preferably  don't  babysit  again and make it clear  to your parents  why.", "I would have been worried sick if my sibling doesn't answer the phone and isn't back from dinner after 10."]}
