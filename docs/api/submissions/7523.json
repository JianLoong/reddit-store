He\u2019d never call to say what was happening and we couldn\u2019t go anywhere whilst they were with us because we only had one car and it wouldn\u2019t fit all of us in.

When she was dating, I had to watch her kids while she went out, but the constant favors were never reciprocated. If I said I have a life too, I would get yelled at.

It\u2019s completely frustrating. Shit just happens though. Sometimes I\u2019ll watch my niece and nephew and ask for my sister to try not to be out too late but she looses track of time. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I love my niece and nephew and idm having them overnight even when it was planned to just be a few hours. I get to have fun with them. I\u2019ll watch a movie and make popcorn, have a dance party, make silly jokes, play games\u2026I mean, watching a kid is the best excuse to let your inner child out. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole for being upset or even saying \u201cI don\u2019t wanna watch your kid anymore if you do that\u201d. I think I\u2019ve seen the rough side of my sisters life enough to have more sympathy and understanding. Every parent deserves a night out or a day to themselves. Though I will say, she should\u2019ve just asked. Have you always said no to watching your niece over night before? It could\u2019ve been the reason why tbh. Not saying like you\u2019re unreliable it\u2019s just a sneaky thing ppl do tbh. And sometimes my sister does this shit with us and it\u2019s so frustrating but again she looses track of time sometimes especially if she\u2019s been drinking. \u201cShe chose to party than to watch her own kid\u201d is just kinda mean though. Every parent deserves some time to themselves to have fun. I don\u2019t think it was a maliciously intended night. And even if she was thinking that the only way to do so was to ask you to watch your niece for a few hours, (clearly that\u2019s not right.)she probably just felt she could trust you to watch her kid for the night and thought you wouldn\u2019t mind. Which again, that\u2019s not okay.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think either of you are the asshole tbh. I genuinely understand the frustration on your end. Maybe talk about it some more once things have cooled down? Express why you\u2019re upset and what made you upset. Bc tbh you have every right. She didn\u2019t answer, she left you worried and uncertain of her well-being and I feel like that\u2019s the initial problem you\u2019re having. \n\n\nI would very much like to also add as you have an infant, you\u2019re probably exhausted being a mom and I understand why you\u2019d be upset. Having 2 kids in a house is difficult if they\u2019re not the same age or honestly just in general. Maybe work something out where she watches both your kid and hers at the same time? Who knows it could be a fun time for everyone?\u263a\ufe0f so I\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA nor is she. I really just feel like this is rooted in frustration on both sides and that each person is understandably upset at one another.

You only told her the truth, that she need to prioritise her daughter not her social life. \n\nYou have no responsibility, would she do the same and she wouldn\u2019t do the same for one. She is a adult and a parent, she choose this and if she wants a social life, needs to start paying for babysitters and see how they react if she had left her daughter overnight without previous agreement.", "NTA - your parents need to be told that the agreement was for dinner and that she was unresponsive.  If there was an emergency she has to take a call.  She lied and was gone until morning which wasn't your arrangement.", "NTA - there\u2019s a difference between watching a child for a few hours and watching them overnight. She lied to you, plain and simple.", "NTA! if your parents are going you a hard time, they can watch your sisters daughter. You are also a mom with your own life and family to take care of. She is 100% taking advantage of you by putting you in this situation and now is manipulating things so that you'll feel obligated to help her do the same thing again in the future. I'd be livid", "NTA she didn\u2019t even ask you to watch her overnight, only for a few hours and then went no contact. That\u2019s ridiculous.", "NTA. It would be one thing if you had agreed to an overnight, but you didn't. Or if she had called you and said \"Things are running long, do you mind keeping niece overnight?\" Thefe were plenty of better ways to handle this and your sister chose the worst one.", "NTA.  Sister lied to OP in order to get her to watch the niece overnight.  Sister knew what she was doing and I don't blame OP for being pissed.\n\nIt's great that all these people are telling OP she's the AH - so now she can tell them all that they are free to watch the niece overnight.", "Nta unless you did it in front of the kid", "NTA, tell your parents the truth and if they still take her side, cut them all off or expect this same scenario time after time.", " NTA you\u2019re a responsible adult, your sister is abusing your generosity", "NTA overall. A little bit AH for the whole you\u2019re a parent so you\u2019re not allowed to party and if you do you\u2019re a bad parent thing. However sister is way bigger because she lied. She essentially abandoned her kid for 12 hours, from when she was supposed to be back to when she actually showed up. Also made you and your parents worry needlessly. You had no idea if something had happened to her since she didn\u2019t let anyone know where she was for so long.", "INFO\n\nWhy didn\u2019t she leave her kid with the kid\u2019s dad?\n\nNTA\n\nQuit babysitting for your sister.  Your parents can babysit if they think being family obligates you.", "NTA\n\nThe problem isn't that she stayed out all night. The problem is that she deliberately lied about it beforehand so she could do what she wanted to and not get told no. Had she arranged for overnight child care and just been honest it would have been fine. (Although I expect you'd have said no so she'd have had to pay someone.)\n\nShe broke your trust in an incredibly irresponsible way. Give your parents the full story and explain you can't trust your sister to be honest about any kind of babysitting arrangement anymore.", "NTA\n\nTell your sister to drop her child off to your parents from now on - see how long that lasts", "Poor kid. At 2 she would need to know if she is going to sleep at Aunt's house, wher her favourite teddy is etc. And OP would need to know whether she should tuck the kid in for the night or just put a blanket over her on the sofa bc Mom will be here any minute now.\n\nThis was completely AH move from the sister. And I agree she probably lied to the parents.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Sounds like your parents just volunteered to be your sister's full time babysitters.", "NTA  Tell your parents she lied to you.  This is the critical point.  If you remove the childcare issue, then you can talk about the real problem.  Let them defend that.", "NTA. You have your own child to take care of and your sister is taking advantage of you", "She tells you shes going to dinner and went to an all night party then call you a AH for calling her out on her immature decision AND your parents had the nerve to argue with you about it ESH except you.", "I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s child abandonment tbh?? Like she didn\u2019t abandon her daughter she left her daughter with her sister that she trusted and came back in the morning.", "She told OP dinner and instead went to a party.   Sister flat out lied to OP there was no \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d.  Then she didn\u2019t answer her phone when OP called.  If she wants to go out partying then she needs to at least tell the truth so the person looking after HER kids knows when to expect her back.", "That was my thought - hey there's this party. Would it be cool if \\[kiddo\\] did an overnight.\n\nAbsent that, it's a shitty thing to do.", "Technically it's still child abandonment. I agree the kid wasn't really in any danger or anything but still abandonment", "With babysitters, it\u2019s normal to outline the planned routine of both the child and the parent, and how to reach them if something comes up.  \n\nFor example:\nAssuming this works for your schedule, she\u2019s going to need a nap around 2, she gets hungry for snack around 4, this is for dinner, she gets a book and goes down around 7:30. \n\nI\u2019ll be going to watch _movie at _place around _time, then probably _restaurant  or _friend\u2019s place after, and will plan to pick her up between 8 and 9.  Please try not to call between (movie show times) unless you have to, but definitely go ahead and call at bedtime.", "No, no, no. Everyone would equate dinner with a couple of hours, not overnight. And most people with sense specify if they are asking anyone to keep a child overnight because it is not the norm to ask family for that. You didn't fail to communicate, your sister did.\n\nAlso, no parent in their right mind ignores call from the babysitter! She just wanted to party, lied to get you to watch her daughter, and pissed off. At this rate you don't even know if she will come back to get her daughter in the future! NTA and your mother can watch the kid if she thinks it's so easy. Your parents and your sister are all assholes.", "NTA. you aren't allowed to disappear or change plans.  Property communication is an important boundary to set, especially when caring for someone else's kids.", "Or brought someone home.", "I'm assuming she managed to drive herself home", "May I ask how?? This may be just me being confused bc I\u2019ve been in this situation and I\u2019d never consider it abandonment. Genuinely not trying to argue I\u2019m just a bit confused. /gen question", "my niece is 2, i used my own food and she only provided 5 diapers. my baby isn\u2019t even 1 yet so we had to make do with that."]}
