He\u2019d never call to say what was happening and we couldn\u2019t go anywhere whilst they were with us because we only had one car and it wouldn\u2019t fit all of us in.

It\u2019s completely frustrating. Shit just happens though. Sometimes I\u2019ll watch my niece and nephew and ask for my sister to try not to be out too late but she looses track of time. Maybe it\u2019s just me but I love my niece and nephew and idm having them overnight even when it was planned to just be a few hours. I get to have fun with them.

I think I\u2019ve seen the rough side of my sisters life enough to have more sympathy and understanding. Every parent deserves a night out or a day to themselves. Though I will say, she should\u2019ve just asked. Have you always said no to watching your niece over night before? It could\u2019ve been the reason why tbh. Not saying like you\u2019re unreliable it\u2019s just a sneaky thing ppl do tbh. And sometimes my sister does this shit with us and it\u2019s so frustrating but again she looses track of time sometimes especially if she\u2019s been drinking. \u201cShe chose to party than to watch her own kid\u201d is just kinda mean though. Every parent deserves some time to themselves to have fun. I don\u2019t think it was a maliciously intended night. And even if she was thinking that the only way to do so was to ask you to watch your niece for a few hours, (clearly that\u2019s not right.)she probably just felt she could trust you to watch her kid for the night and thought you wouldn\u2019t mind. Which again, that\u2019s not okay.\n\nAgain, I don\u2019t think either of you are the asshole tbh. I genuinely understand the frustration on your end. Maybe talk about it some more once things have cooled down? Express why you\u2019re upset and what made you upset. Bc tbh you have every right. She didn\u2019t answer, she left you worried and uncertain of her well-being and I feel like that\u2019s the initial problem you\u2019re having. \n\n\nI would very much like to also add as you have an infant, you\u2019re probably exhausted being a mom and I understand why you\u2019d be upset. Having 2 kids in a house is difficult if they\u2019re not the same age or honestly just in general. Maybe work something out where she watches both your kid and hers at the same time? Who knows it could be a fun time for everyone?\u263a\ufe0f so I\u2019d say you\u2019re NTA nor is she.

Stand your ground and make her parent her own child for awhile.", "I hate people like ur sister", "NTA she made a choice, a bad one and expected you to enable. Nope.", "NTA mostly for the fact that she became unreachable. She made you worry about her all night wondering where she was. She lied to you.", "NTA - I mean she \"Abused\" your kindness.  I would not watch the niece anymore either", "If your parents are cool with her ditching her kid on someone else so she can go party, they can watch her. NTA", "Dinner? Looks like a booty call, sounds like a booty call, quacks like a booty call. Face it, the real problem is that she lied to you, and if you acted like it was no bid deal, it'd bee a weekend next, and pretty soon you'd have to babysit 2 or her kids.", "Mooostly NTA. It's not awful of a mom to want their child watched overnight while they have a night off (and there's a little judgeyness around that in your explanation) BUT it absolutely is an asshole move to trick someone into watching your kid by not being upfront with them about how long it'll be! It's the fact that she lied to you that is the problem, rather than the fact that she chose to be out all night, and that is a good reason to not watch her child again, because now you can't trust her to be honest about what they will entail.", "[deleted]", "Gotta turn this around.  They have you on the defensive after you did watch her child but b came alarmed when she never came back from dinner.\n\nThat she left herself incommunicado after dropping off her child is the greater act if irresponsibility here.\nLeaving one\u2019s child with a babysitter and then being an unreachable parent is not good!  What if there had been a fire in your home, or her child had become ill, etc.  That she did not tell you where or how you could reach her is a bigger issue than tricking you into  an overnight sit because she figured you might say no.  \n\nYour parents are letting you know they have no problem with her doing that so calmly say it makes sense that they babysit from now on because they don\u2019t need to know where mom is or how to reach her but you do.  \n\nShe told you she was going out to dinner.  You knew no different until the next morning.  What if she was laying in a ditch somewhere.  Would she be fine with nobody looking for her; nobody finding that her car had gone off the road?\n\nSure she needs to get out now and then but she also needs to be a grownup.", "Nta, she completely disappeared. For all you knew, she was dead in a ditch somewhere ( God, I sound like my own mother). She chose to party and pretend she didn't have any responsibilities. I get that parenting is hard but you have to come home to your kids and do your best. She didn't do that", "NTA but there's nothing wrong with wanting to go out and have fun BUT you have to make it known to the person who's watching your child where you are, as well as making sure you're contactable in a situation.  I don't blame your sister for wanting a night to herself but she did it in such a huge idiotic way that you are 100%", "this is unacceptable.  Stand by your guns", "NTA. Tell them the truth.", "NTA.  Your sister took advantage.  Stick to your guns and tell your parents to mind their own business.", "NTA", "NTA. Your sister has behaved irresponsibly. Taking advantage of your kindness and going no contact all night. I wouldn\u2019t babysit for her anymore either.", "NTA - don't watch her child again! Let everybody giving you a hard time about babysitting, watch the kid every time she wants to go out. We\u2019ll see how long it lasts.", "Op should tell her parents they just volunteered for overnights...", "Not only did you not agree to overnight, but your sister didn't send enough diapers AND also didn't answer her phone.  What if there was an emergency?  I think this last point is important in your decision not to babysit your niece.", "Pretty good cover and if there is someone in the world that approaches Tom Petty\u2019s level of coolness it\u2019s Sam Elliott.", "\\*claps\\* YES TO THIS!!", "NTA!!! She\u2019s selfish and irresponsible. Let your parents watch their grandchild and she can go party.", "There's nothing wrong with having your neice stay the night, but that expectation should have been set before she left the child with you. She essentially left you with no way to contact her in an emergency. Not very responsible of her. I wouldn't babysit for her either.", "NTA. Your sister abused your kindness and generosity. You don\u2019t owe her childcare. Your parents are enabling her irresponsible reckless behaviour and are putting pressure on you because they don\u2019t want to become the overnight babysitters. Your family are users who don\u2019t respect you. I would go LC with them", "NTA. Shes got a kid, time to F-ing grow up!", "NTA, your parents were lied to clearly", "NTA  - obviously she can be trusted and will probably pull this crap again. \n\nOn a side note - parents can still go to parties (depending on the age of the child) but obviously need to find a willing babysitter, and be available.", "NTA\n\nAnd if that is how your parents feel about the situation, they can volunteer to watch their grandchild next time. Also, your sister is not entitled to your unlimited help, especially as you have your own child to look after. \n\nWould you sister return the favour and would she appreciate it if *you* pulled a similar stunt?", "NTA. Your parents can watch the child if they think your sister needs SO much help \ud83d\ude44\n\nNever watch her for your sister again until she SINCERELY apologizes.", "NTA. You agreed to babysit your niece for the evening so your sister could go to a dinner.\n\nThe fact that it turned into an overnight, without prior notice was her first mistake (I\u2019m fairly certain that if you knew it would be overnight, you\u2019d still do it, but be more prepared), partying all night and not letting anyone know where she was, was her second.\n\nYou have an infant child requiring a fair amount of attention, a niece probably wondering where her mother is, and then there\u2019s you, having no idea where your sister is and unable to contact her. For all you knew she could have been in a serious accident/situation.\n\nAnd the most important part seems to be that she doesn\u2019t seem to really understand where you\u2019re coming from, perhaps a proper sit down with your sister (and your parents (since they don\u2019t seem see your point of view)) and just be honest about the reasons you are reluctant to babysit again. \n\nTry to work it out because the real person that would be punished in all of this is your niece.", "NTA. Tell your parents the truth about what happened. She had that baby and now it\u2019s time to grow up.", "NTA, and what your sister did was awful.\n\nIt is common courtesy that if you want somebody to babysit for you, you tell them when you'll be back!", "NTA. You warned her now stay firm.", "NTA\n\nYour parents can watch their grandchild while your sister is out and about partying it up. Maybe she'll give them another one...", "NTA, nothing's really wrong with wanting to party, especially that young. But she's responsible for at minimum communicating to you basic things like she'll be out all night or her phone's about to die, etc. I wouldn't want to babysit for someone who didn't have the courtesy to be upfront either.", "NTA and ur parents are AH\u2019s for agreeing with ur AH sister.", "I'm surprised the parents believed the sister after getting a call after 10 PM wondering where she is?", "If one of my sisters pulled this on me I'd leave a voicemail that there was a accident and kiddo has severe injuries and I was waiting for a ambulance. If that doesn't get her ass to my house as fast as humanly possible I would call the cops to file a missing persons report and a child abandonment claim. I love my niblings but you popped them out, not me, you  either find overnight sitters or you stay home", "NTA \nI would've been mad or not answered the phone", "NTA. Tell anyone who asks precisely what happened. She played a sneak attack and I wouldn\u2019t trust her again either.", "NTA - boundaries. She could have called and asked if it was acceptable to you. Horrible to make you worry.", "NTA - you hit the nail on the head with \u201cshe signed up to be a parent\u201d and it\u2019s her JOB to be a parent to HER child. And if your parents think she deserves/needs help then they can watch her kid since they signed up to be HER (your sister\u2019s) parents. Your only responsibility is to your own child.", "NTA\n\nCouple things here:\n\nMake sure to stick to your guns and do not watch her kid(s) again. This is an important teachable moment for your sister. She has a kid but doesn\u2019t seem to be an adult yet.\n\nAnd now that you are an adult, you need to reevaluate your relationship and communication with your parents. If they reach out to you again, you explain the situation like an adult and push back on an emotional manipulation like an adult. \n\nYour sister\u2019s poor behavior is partly their fault.", "NTA", "NTA. sounds like she is one of these immature baby girl mamas.", "NTA but nip it in the bud now. I was 26 & divorced and have a son & nephew 7 weeks apart (they weren\u2019t even 2). My sister demanded I watch her son 3-4 nights a week while she hung out with her friends or went on date nights with her husband and told me I was divorced and required to watch her son with mine so she could get quality time with her husband since she stayed married and I was divorced so needed to prioritize OUR children. My parents guilted me for YEARS into keeping her happy because nobody ever said no to their eldest daughter. I was only \u201callowed\u201d to stop watching him when I literally moved across the country. Her son still calls her by her first name 10 years later and she\u2019s had to watch her own kids for the last 5 years alone because the hubby she was so dedicated to refuses to help and his family calls it burdensome. I\u2019ve never received a single thank you - have gotten a couple of coffee mugs though which allegedly makes up for 5 years of free sitting (when I had to beg on my knees for my parents or her to keep my son 1 weekend a year for my birthday).", "NTA. Like others have said, she lied to your parents. I would also clarify with your parents that she never told you/asked you to watch her overnight. She didn't give you the option to plan with that in mind.", "Honestly? \n\nI wouldn't be surprised if the OP's sister was upfront about what she did. \n\nShe's only 22! She shouldn't have to sacrifice her youth just because she has a baby! OP, you're the older sister, you need to help your younger siblings when they can't handle being adults. Let her be a kid for a few more years! You already have one, so it's not that big of a burden.\n\n/s", "That's bullshit calling OP an AH. She absolutely has every right to be pissed at her sister. It doesn't make OP wrong for it. She doesn't need to do shit to communicate a damn thing. Her sister lied and she'll do it again if given the chance!", "sounds like an immature little girl mommy to me", "hell yeah. let them deal with it. that'll sober them up real quick", "definitely.\n\nshe abandoned her kid on OP withno respect for any plans OP might have had. what's next, \"dinner....(and a secret flight to the maldives)\"?", "one night or is this a pattern of behaviour?"]}
