It's nice of you to agree to watch her but if she wanted the child to stay overnight, she should have made that known upfront.

You are correct to not put yourself in that position again. Your parents can take over if it's important to them.", "I'm going to say NTA to your title; refusing to watch your niece after that stunt. I would say your immediate reaction was a little much, saying you would never watch her again. If you choose to watch, I would make sure she gives you specifics (how long, where she will be, and confirm she will pick up her phone in case of an emergency). Anyone watching her kid would be given that information. I would have panicked if she was gone all night, thinking she only went to dinner. I understand not wanting to do overnights- place your boundaries with her before committing with her again in the future. Also, if your parents think your sister needs help, they can watch her kid; that is no way your obligation, ever.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

However, since she wanted to go to a party, she knew that she was going to be gone longer than just an average time for dinner.  What she really wanted was an all night or into late night baby sitter, she should have been upfront with that.  You could have planned for an overnight visit with your niece or you could have declined if that was something that you didn't want to do or couldn't do.\n\nI'm sure she didn't get home at midnight and \"fell asleep.\"  She probably got home and passed out.

One of the major problem here is that she lied and that if something serious had happened to her child, there would have been no way to contact her. Yes, as a parent, it is important to make some time for yourself (in moderation) but lying about your whereabouts and not being able to be contacted is reckless.\n\nChances are that you will still look after your niece at some point and your sister will look after yours (thinking emergency/special event), however you need to set clear boundaries (set pick up time/always phone on...) and consequences, including possibly calling the police if she fell to turn up after a few hours (as some babysitters have done in the past).\n\nIf she wants to party, then she will have to ask your parents for babysitting.\n\nI would also made it clear to your parents your point of view and how her behaviour was immature and reckless.
