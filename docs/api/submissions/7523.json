It's nice of you to agree to watch her but if she wanted the child to stay overnight, she should have made that known upfront.

I would say your immediate reaction was a little much, saying you would never watch her again. If you choose to watch, I would make sure she gives you specifics (how long, where she will be, and confirm she will pick up her phone in case of an emergency). Anyone watching her kid would be given that information. I would have panicked if she was gone all night, thinking she only went to dinner. I understand not wanting to do overnights- place your boundaries with her before committing with her again in the future.

However, since she wanted to go to a party, she knew that she was going to be gone longer than just an average time for dinner.  What she really wanted was an all night or into late night baby sitter, she should have been upfront with that.  You could have planned for an overnight visit with your niece or you could have declined if that was something that you didn't want to do or couldn't do.\n\nI'm sure she didn't get home at midnight and \"fell asleep.\"  She probably got home and passed out.  She left her daughter somewhere overnight without any overnight things.\n\nIf you ever babysit for her again, you will not be able to trust that she will be back when she said that she would.  If your parents are local, let them babysit for her.", "NTA. The way she worded the request was not to watch her daughter overnight, it was for an evening.", "NTA. She violated boundaries, hardcore. That\u2019s what she gets for lying and taking advantage of a situation.", "NTA  \n\n\nTaking care of your niece for a few a hours is one thing, but going off to a party, not telling anyone and causing everyone to worry needlessly is another.  \n\n\nStick to your guns.

One of the major problem here is that she lied and that if something serious had happened to her child, there would have been no way to contact her. Yes, as a parent, it is important to make some time for yourself (in moderation) but lying about your whereabouts and not being able to be contacted is reckless.\n\nChances are that you will still look after your niece at some point and your sister will look after yours (thinking emergency/special event), however you need to set clear boundaries (set pick up time/always phone on...) and consequences, including possibly calling the police if she fell to turn up after a few hours (as some babysitters have done in the past).\n\nIf she wants to party, then she will have to ask your parents for babysitting.\n\nI would also made it clear to your parents your point of view and how her behaviour was immature and reckless.

No, OP doesn\u2019t need to \u201chelp\u201d her sister act like sister\u2019s daughter doesn\u2019t exist, especially when the sister can\u2019t show basic respect for OP and OP\u2019s time in the first place.

I ended up in tears by the time they got back, but they were only coming back to grab something and go again, I was like nope I\u2019m not dealing with this.

Don't help her anymore use that energy for yourself and your LO.\n\nYour sister choose her path and if your parents want to support her tell them \"No YOU babysit next time she wants to party all night and abandon her child.

If your parents feel so bad then they can look after the niece and deal with her mother occasionally abandoning her.", "They don't want to do it because there is a high chance that they'll be practically raising their grandchild.
