Anyone watching her kid would be given that information. I would have panicked if she was gone all night, thinking she only went to dinner.

However, since she wanted to go to a party, she knew that she was going to be gone longer than just an average time for dinner.  What she really wanted was an all night or into late night baby sitter, she should have been upfront with that.  You could have planned for an overnight visit with your niece or you could have declined if that was something that you didn't want to do or couldn't do.\n\nI'm sure she didn't get home at midnight and \"fell asleep.\"  She probably got home and passed out.  She left her daughter somewhere overnight without any overnight things.\n\nIf you ever babysit for her again, you will not be able to trust that she will be back when she said that she would.

One of the major problem here is that she lied and that if something serious had happened to her child, there would have been no way to contact her. Yes, as a parent, it is important to make some time for yourself (in moderation) but lying about your whereabouts and not being able to be contacted is reckless.\n\nChances are that you will still look after your niece at some point and your sister will look after yours (thinking emergency/special event), however you need to set clear boundaries (set pick up time/always phone on...) and consequences, including possibly calling the police if she fell to turn up after a few hours (as some babysitters have done in the past).\n\nIf she wants to party, then she will have to ask your parents for babysitting.\n\nI would also made it clear to your parents your point of view and how her behaviour was immature and reckless.

Is it the dishonesty that is the biggest issue, or that your sister is out partying with a young child?\n\nEdit: I mean, I could see it being both. A sleepover with cousins old enough to enjoy it is different from the added work of a young child overnight and the lying and not answering the phone was bad.

That\u2019s happened to me too, I worked 7 hours one day in the heat and my cousin asked me if I was able to watch her stepdaughter while she and her partner (the dad) go out to a party for a *couple* of hours.. it was getting so late and they weren\u2019t coming home. I ended up in tears by the time they got back, but they were only coming back to grab something and go again, I was like nope I\u2019m not dealing with this.

She may have had too much to drink and needed to crash or wasn\u2019t safe driving home.  You\u2019re right in telling her an overnight isn\u2019t acceptable without you agreeing to it but saying you\u2019ll never watch your niece again after one miscommunication incident like this just seems like an overreaction to me.  I think you could have just expressed your displeasure and set tougher rules for the future with the threat you would stop babysitting if she can\u2019t be more responsible.", "NTA - For your own peace of mind, tell your parents the whole truth, and if they continue to insist you have to look after your niece remind them that their niece has a mother to do that, just as you've been doing so with your own child. If your parents feel so bad then they can look after the niece and deal with her mother occasionally abandoning her.", "They don't want to do it because there is a high chance that they'll be practically raising their grandchild.

I take it your sister lives with your parents?  Maybe they\u2019re tired of babysitting.", "NTA- it would be one thing if she was straight up with you and asked you every once in a while to watch her child overnight. But to say she\u2019s going to dinner and then never answer any calls and then show up the next morning it sounds like she planned that all along. It\u2019s not your responsibility to care for her child when she goes out to party all the time.

Tell your parents what happened. If they still have a problem, then THEY can watch their grandkid when the mom wants to party all night.", "NTA- as others have said, explain the distinction in what happened.

I mean, 10 pm and you were expecting her home from dinner? She's not a child.", "NTA your sister needs to get her shit together and if she is even willing to do that. Technically once she didn't answer and didn't give you the actual facts of what was going on I want to say that's child abandonment?", "NTA..... Partying once in a while isn't an issue. If it's a regular thing, then it's a big deal. The big issues here is the lying, not setting the right expectations, and not being available for contact in the event of an emergency.", "NTA and don\u2019t back down.", "NTA. I had my first son at 19. I was never into partying either. My parents watched my son so I could work and go to school. Starting at 25 they watched him a few times so I could go on a trip with friends but that was like once, maybe twice, a year and I asked & went over details prior to booking everything to ensure it wasn\u2019t too much of a burden for them. I also provided them with my friends names & numbers, the hotel, and flight info (dates, times, airline, flight #). If that were the case it\u2019d be one thing. Or if it were maybe once a month AND she was honest about where she was AND about how long she needed you to watch her child.", "NTA and that isn't helping. That is being taken advantage of. Her not answering your calls is total BS. What if it had been an emergency? You are right to not watch your niece again until your sister grows up and becomes an actual adult. Tell your parents that if they think what she did was ok then they can watch their granddaughter.", "NTA.  You offered to help.  She took advantage of you.  Now you aren't willing to help.  Simple.  Had she not been an awful person.  Lying to you.  Ditching you.  You would probably still be helping.", "NTA. While you do sound kinda judgey, she lied to you and didn't answer multiple calls. Anything could have been happening with her child. That is manipulative, irresponsible, immature and dangerous. That's not okay.", "NTA. Hell no you aren\u2019t the AH. Let me tell you a story my niece and nephew are wonderful but their Dad would use my wife, my mother in law\u2019s, and I\u2019s old place as his custody drop off then some weekends not show up. Which meant we would watch his kids for a whole weekend. So when we moved into our new place that shit stopped. He resents us for it. \n\nDon\u2019t let your parents bully you into feeling bad. Your sister needs to realize that kids come first.", "NTA. She did not say she wanted you to keep her child overnight and should not have expected you to do so.", "NTA, tell your parents the whole truth. Point out that you were genuinely concerned for your sisters safety when the truth is she abandoned her child with you overnight. What if you called the police, fearing she had been in an accident and then when she turns up the police get CPS involved? Ask how they would have handled the situation differently and why you should watch your niece again if your sister lies about her where abouts and puts so much stress on you. What if you had an emergency or an early morning appointment? I'm guessing you dont have a car seat for niece, your sister cant just not answer her phone. What if niece had a medical emergency, is your sister just happy for you to make decisions? \n\nSeriously, sit down with your parents, ask the questions above and then ask if they really think you should babysit again when you cant even trust your sister to answer the phone in an emergency.", "She may not be a child, but she is responsible for her child, which means she needs to come home when she said she'd be there.", "Yes. Which is why I noted she was an AH.", "Yes, exactly. If anything had happened, OP didn't have legal parental responsibility, and couldn't get hold of the parent; there could have been serious consequences potentially. It's just not worth taking that risk, even leaving aside the bad manners of it."]}
