The first time coffee, the next time walking around a dog park, third time grabbing drinks.\n\nOur 4th time out we went to a restaurant, not an apple bees but not Ruth Chris or anything. Middle tier. I ordered everything I\u2019d normally order. An app, 2 drinks, salmon dinner.He paid and I thought we had a good time.\n\nWhen we were texting later, he stated that he\u2019d like to take me out again but only if I don\u2019t overspend on his dime. I explained I ordered exactly what I\u2019d have rather he was paying or not and that I don\u2019t go on dates and choose things I wouldn\u2019t normally get. I would have been fine with paying. Well he says my view is an AH view and the reason guys don\u2019t like dating. \n\nI told my sister and she agreed. She says you should always order the least expensive thing on the menu and never get more then one drink. I\u2019m trying to have a nice time not clock everything I\u2019m ordering. So AITA?\n\nI\u2019ll add I paid for the drinks on our third date. He pulled out his wallet and said, \u201cI got this\u201d. I did say okay I\u2019ll pay for the next time. His food did cost more then mine? And when I paid for drinks he was ordering premium, I know he isn\u2019t hurting for money as we have discussed careers and finances.", "created_utc": 1671228002, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/znqbn3/aita_for_overspending_on_a_date/", "score": 1907, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Yeah, NTA\n\nI don't care what my date orders. If I can't afford it or it's a touchy time for me, I don't go out on a date. If my date wants to split the bill, fine. If not, I'm prepared to pay for it. Complaining about what you ordered on the date is his issue, not yours. All of these rules about splitting the check on X date, or ordering the Y priced item on the menu on the Z date... these are ridiculous. It's a date, it's supposed to be fun, and adding all of these \"rules\" just makes it more stressful than it should be. Personally, I'd take it as a sign that this is a catch-and-release situation and move on to the next person.", "NTA \n\nThe guy is transactional. Run. Guys like this think paying for a drink or dinner earns them sex. He\u2019s probably only being pissy because you didn\u2019t sleep with him after.", "NTA - Just split the bill next time, if he has a problem with that, then I'd bail.", "NTA. That's a totally normal order for a date, and he is ridiculous. He's selfish and stingy. Good riddance.", "it's super awkward that he brought it up. way to make you feel bad..", "NTA\n\nIf he invites you, he either pays gladly or he warns you that he would not go up to a certain price. What nonsense is that to pay the bill only to be a passive agressive d*ck after ? \n\nIf he can't pay you could just split the bill. What is the point of going to a restaurant to sip water and eat something just because it's cheap ?", "NTA, this is creepy negging you.  Adults say things like \" Can we split this?\".  It is insulting to be judged about how much you ordered.  No one forced him to pay.", "NTA.  \n\n\nAnd good job on being smart with the first date. Remember folks. first date is one drink.", "So NTA!!! Welcome to your future with this guy and always monitoring spending.  When I was dating I would never take someone to a restaurant I wasn't willing to buy most of the things on the menu.  I could see if you were on a couple of dates and whenever you paid you ordered a salad but when he paid you ordered a lobster and filet surf and turf, but that is not the case.  He is 29 and he should know better.", "NTA\n\nAre you...dating George Constanza here? Jesus.", "I feel bad for people dating these days, everything seems so complicated.", "NTA just keep making offers to pay when you go on dates and see what happens. It\u2019s these little things that are very telling. You\u2019re dating to get to know someone right? Welp you got to know him!", "NTA\n\nThis reminds me of when I was dating someone and I literally could barely afford my own food. If my date had ordered that much I probably would've had a mini melt down as well. But something I realized later is it's not your problem (aka, it wasn't my date's problem that I was broke and too macho to ask for help, holding us back from doing fun things). \n\nIf he is too insecure to let you pay for your own food, and/or too broke to pay for both of your food, he shouldn't be taking anyone out to dinner. And everyone saying it's customary to get something inexpensive... Yeah maybe if you had discussed it beforehand but it sounds like that didn't happen. We aren't living in the past where men have to pay for every meal. If you can afford what you want, get it! His reaction is the problem here, not you ordering what you wanted.", "NTA. But I so prefer to just pay for my own meal so I don't have to play games not getting what I really want.", "NTA.  Tell the asshole to go find a cheap date he can afford.", "NTA.  Find a new date, seriously.", "Barf. Leave him and take yourself out.", "NTA clearly, something is off with him, he offered to pay at the end and then complained about it. Weird weird. Btw your sister is wrong, order what you want.", "NTA, never heard of Ruth Chris so I had to look at their menu prices just for some reference. Definitely NTA, If I had taken a woman out on a 4th date I WOULD BE EXPECTING to eat good. An app  (app or desert/ usually not both) maybe a steak and have a few drinks just like you described. Shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. \n\nMy question is he mad that he paid more than he wanted too?    OR is he mad that he paid for a nice dinner and didn\u2019t get laid (3rd/4th date expectations)", "If someone was that cheap to bring this up after the fact, I would just cut my losses.

He\u2019s showing his true colours nice & early, how generous of him. Don\u2019t see him again.", "NTA. Ditch the dude. I'd be petty as hell.

But I\u2019m also fairly independent so this guys reeks of insecurity", "NTA. Until you decide a dating partner is truly going somewhere though, I would just pay for myself. Then, there is no guilt and you are proving to them that you are a strong independent woman who doesn't want to, nor need to, live on their dime. Because screw feeling like you owe people.", "NTA. You would have paid for yourself if given the opportunity. You've paid for his drinks before. He is being cheap and your sister is playing into a stereotype. On dates I always pay for myself.", "NTA. Just move on to someone who doesn't suck. 2 drinks an app and dinner is nothing if it's to meet good company. I'd cover that for a friend.", "NTA\n\nMy man here is keeping a list of what he spends on you. That's why I always pay for what I order, some men can't be trusted with basic decency.", "Your sister sounds like an A too.\nNTA, you found out early that he was a passive-aggressive cheapskate.", "NTA - It\u2019s on him for offering to pay for the both of you, then deciding later he didn\u2019t like what he spent. He blamed you for *his* choice.\n\nFrom now on, just split.

It sounds like you two aren\u2019t compatible financially.", "NTA , he shouldn\u2019t have taken you somewhere that he could not afford to eat.

If he was worried about money then he should have taken you to fast food. Although I think in the future it\u2019s best to discuss paying before dinner. At least I have always done.", "NTA\n\nHe should have taken you to a restaurant he could afford \ud83d\ude02\n\nApp, entree and drinks are normal. I guess he expected you to eat a salad\ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe", "NTA - some of your comments give the information I need. I typically try to mirror my ordering to my companion, especially if I know or suspect they might be paying. If they order an expensiv drink, then I will order one as well. \n\nAnd it sounds like he ordered a premium meal (steak) and a high end drink and your meal and two drinks was comparable. I'm not sure where this guy gets off suggesting he should be able to order $100 and you should order.........$30?", "NTA. This is completely on him. All this \u201cdate etiquette\u201d is bullshit. Order what you want because you can pay for it. If they can\u2019t pay for it they shouldn\u2019t offer and then be offended at what you ordered. You never expected him to pay, you just accepted his offer. Why would you eat/drink according to somebody else\u2019s budget when you plan to pay yourself. It makes no sense.", "NTA. He could\u2019ve easily asked for help with the bill if he thought it was too much. Plus it was the 4th date. At this point he shouldn\u2019t be thinking that you are just using him to get things. \n\nIf it had been the first or second date I would\u2019ve agreed with him but 4th? Come on.", "So after reading OPs comments, the guys order was more expensive. When they went out again and she paid, he did the same thing and ordered multiple premium drinks.\n\nI would say \u201cI had a great time with you, but after giving it thought I have came to the conclusion that we are not financially compatible. I wish you luck out there in finding what you\u2019re searching for!\u201d \n\nOf course he\u2019s going to be hurt and reply with something vile and tacky, as every guy like this guy who receives even a grain of rejection does. But it shows you\u2019re unbothered and the better person.", "Ummm no.  You\u2019re definitely NTA.  If I\u2019m going on a date I want to have a good time.  If I\u2019m going to a nice restaurant I\u2019m going to get something I wouldn\u2019t get at a chain.  It would be one thing if you ordered one of every main entree or drank to much that you fell asleep at the table.  Pass on this guy.  Life\u2019s too short.", "Wow. Walk away. Marinara flag flying proudly. NTA.", "NTA - run girl. If he considers sharing an appetizer at dinner, having 2 cocktails and ordering an entree \u201coverspending on his dime\u201d, just imagine what the rest of the relationship would be like. That sounds so stressful and annoying, if you\u2019re going out for dinner, enjoy yourself! My boyfriend and I both order whatever we want no matter what (and sometimes we spend a stupid amount of money because \u2728impulse control\u2728) and we basically fight over the check because we want to treat each other to something special. I bet this guy reuses his cling wrap.", "NTA.\n\nIf he was actually price conscious, he could\u2019ve mentioned that ahead of time. He just sounds cheap.\n\n\u201cOnly if you don\u2019t overspend on his dime\u201d\u2026 \n\nEveryone has a different concept of what\u2019s expensive, and what overspending means, based on their own incomes and comfort levels with spending.\n\nHis lack of communication upfront about expectations is his own fault.\n\nCounter offer - you pay for the date next time? Assuming you are giving him a 5th date. \n\nThen he can\u2019t complain about cost, you\u2019re taking turns paying and acting as equals.", ">Well he says my view is an AH view and the reason guys don\u2019t like dating.\n\nNTA. He complains about having to pay but also hates it when you offer. You do not need this. Send him the estimated money back and end it here. It will hurt his fragile male ego, but he won't be able to call you a gold-digger to his friends.", "Just throw this prospect in the trash. NTA.", "NTA -  You made a pretty standard restaurant order. He could've asked to split the check if it was too much for him to handle. It is funny that he tried to flex with money and turned out to be a cheapskate.", "NTA I have never heard this \"least expensive thing on the menu\" nonsense, I've only ever followed the rule that you don't get anything more expensive than the host does. Same with the drinks, if the host orders a second drink it's only courteous to offer one to their guest as well. But honestly if he had a problem paying for it he should've just asked you to split the bill then, it's so much more tacky to bring it up after the fact, and it feels like a ploy to create a power imbalance where you feel like you owe him.", "NTA. Who even says that to someone? If he didn\u2019t want to pay for a meal at that restaurant he should have taken you to Applebees. I would absolutely never go out with him again if this is him putting his best foot forward you\u2019d be in for a terrible relationship with this guy. The audacity to even say that to a girl he\u2019s just started dating is insane.", "Lame! This attitude doesn\u2019t deserve another date.", "NTA - he\u2019s just cheap. And it\u2019s just a taste of what you\u2019ll see more of (and worse) if he\u2019s doing this on the first real meal date. If he didn\u2019t have the cash flow, he should have picked Applebees. That\u2019s on him. What did he expect you to get? A plain Caesars salad?", "NTA. He is cheap. For complaining about that right off the bat. Dump him. I think your sister is wrong. 2 drinks with dinner is not a lot,and I think an app is reasonable. It would be different if you ordered half the menu or something but I think your order was reasonable for a dinner date. You paid for all the drinks the time before,so you aren't taking advantage of him. For him to say that to you,he'd take you out again \" if you don't overspend\" is tacky and cheap. He has no class. Move on to someone else that will treat you to a nice dinner and not judge you for ordering a normal dinner,as you normally would. \":The reason men don't like going on dates\" \ud83d\ude44 Gimme a break.  He's not going to get a lot of dates by being a cheap ass.", "NTA. You mentioned you offered to split, so dude only has himself to blame if it was out of his budget", "As a man who is no longer dating (married) but spent a lot of time and money online dating, this is an easy NTA\n\nHe took you to a niceish restaurant and mad that you partook? Nah. You didn't do anything wrong. And if he's gonna be like that then he probably isn't the one.", "Nta. Jesus. He could have asked to alternate paying and be done with it. If you have the gumption to say that on a date when you ordered reasonably, he'd nickel and dime you in a relationship.", "NTA \n\nYou have been more than fair and understanding.  He is trying to train you to expect very little from him and you put more money & effort in to please him.    It is simple, he is not datable.   Don't ask someone out, choose the place and then say they were too expensive on the date.   \n\nTake this as a sign that you are not compatible financially if he is counting pennies like that.   More and more men are figuring out that they can't get a date and even more of them are sexless.   So there are plenty of them out there who are more than willing to pay for dinner without a guilt trip afterwards. \n\n   Don't let them gaslight you like this, if you can afford that meal and drinks all on your own, then them saying your too expensive is complete bullshit.   Do you really want to be arguing about the price of every meal and drink for the rest of your life?  He isn't worth this kind of headache or second guessing. \n\n And tell your sister to have better standards, besides she is your sister & should have your back no matter what.", "NTA at all at all. I\u2019m sorry but that\u2019s such bs that you should dictate your ordering in case someone else tries to pick up the check. \n\nI\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t think of any reasonable man that would say something like this to you. If he can\u2019t afford it- he should be up front about that when picking the place and maybe not offer to pay for it?", "NTA - sucks but this guy probs isn\u2019t worth your time! Also the last line about why guys don\u2019t like to date is giving * incel *", "NTA.\n\nThat\u2019s an entirely reasonable meal to order on dinner date and if he had an issue, he should have politely suggested splitting the bill, not just\u2026this.\n\nDating is exhausting.", "NTA... I'm not saying be a gold digger or anything (obvs), but use this as a metric when judging potential partners. If you're not being OVERLY spendy (which you weren't), it's clear his lifestyle and yours just don't match. No harm, no foul.. but don't make yourself less than. Go find you a partner who can provide.", "INFO: Who chose the restaurant? Was there a discussion beforehand about who would pay for the meal and drinks?", "NTA. I figure you are dodging a bullet.", "Just be done. He\u2019s rude", "NTA If he\u2019s offering to pay, he should take you somewhere that fits his budget.", "FWIW, your sister is wrong on the etiquette. When someone else is paying, you're not supposed to pick the most expensive thing *or* the cheapest thing, because that's like calling them cheap. It's best to take their cue and order roughly what they do or ask what they're considering. \n\nNTA. He paid when he didn't have to, just to hold it over your head later. He's got a chip on his shoulder and is testing people. Next!", "NTA - He sounds like a chump if he's so hurt about it that he approaches you by asking not to overspend on his dime. Its just as easy to say \"I don't have another meal in my budget, do you mind if we split?\"", "NTA. He wanted to pay, why is he complaining now?

You didn\u2019t even order dessert. Also to get upset for that at a mid tier place? Did he expect you to get a cheap salad?\n\nEdit: Bruh he got a STEAK and he\u2019s upset with you overspending? Jeez", "NTA. Walk away. Real date #1 shouldn't have any drama.", "NTA. If my date was getting water and something that was 10 bucks I would follow suit.

Biggest red flag, I\u2019d not be considering another date with this guy.", "He\u2019s not the one. Move on.

I feel like a better rule is don\u2019t ask someone out and offer to pay to dinner if you can\u2019t afford it.", "NTA and you were honest with him. Is he strapped for money? Like unemployed or something? IMHO you don\u2019t date if you can\u2019t afford it. If not, he\u2019s being a rude AH by talking about the cost.

Don't change your ways for an idiot!", "NTA\n\nOr, if he\u2019s such a cheap ass he could have expressed that before the date. Or he could have said something at dinner about splitting the check or something. All of this as well as just not being a jerk in general about what you ordered. \n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong at all. This is a ridiculous thing for him to be upset about.

I would order what I would get myself as if I was paying for it. But if he paid I would offer my treat next date. I also always have enough money to cover whatever I might order so that no one feels like I'm expecting them to be an ATM. I think it's more honest to order what you would normally, and I prefer honesty over niceties.  Sure courtesy is a thing but I find if you're genuine and direct from the get go it doesn't waste everyone's time if you have differing views or how a simple conversation around intent and boundaries could be handled between the two parties.

I\u2019m pretty sure the general rule of thumb is go for a lower price tag item. Even a app as a meal type of thing. People I know who are very privileged will follow this rule to a T because a restaurant bill can often come out to a lot. \n\nThat being said I never grew up rich, and when I would go out with other families they would always say \u201cget what you want!\u201d I certainly wouldn\u2019t get lobster but I wasn\u2019t ordering appetizers as my meal. \n\nI\u2019m perfectly happy to split the bill I\u2019m also perfectly happy to pay for my friends because I love them. I\u2019m less happy with picking a cheaper item because it\u2019s \u201cetiquette\u201d \n\nNow, onto the issue at hand. Where I think the \u201cetiquette\u201d gets a little bumpy is this was a date. Which dates don\u2019t have the same etiquette rules. First of all, what kind of \u201cetiquette\u201d is it to say \u201cI\u2019ll take you out but order less food.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m trying to think of how he could\u2019ve gone about it in a nicer way. But I\u2019ll share my similar story. \n\nI met a guy for a date. He picked mediterranean food. The menu had nothing I wanted so I told him I\u2019d just do drinks. He insisted I get whatever I wanted and I felt bad that he would eat alone. \n\nSo I looked closer and something did catch my eye, it was a mediterranean dish that has lamb and is baked in a copper pot with bread on top. I made my choice quick because I hadn\u2019t actually wanted to order anything. But it was the most expensive thing on the menu - oops.

In my experience, women with common sense would always prefer a man being honest about a tight budget instead of being unjustly called out for overspending.

The first time coffee, the next time walking around a dog park, third time grabbing drinks.\n\nOur 4th time out we went to a restaurant, not an apple bees but not Ruth Chris or anything. Middle tier. I ordered everything I\u2019d normally order. An app, 2 drinks, salmon dinner.He paid and I thought we had a good time.\n\nWhen we were texting later, he stated that he\u2019d like to take me out again but only if I don\u2019t overspend on his dime. I explained I ordered exactly what I\u2019d have rather he was paying or not and that I don\u2019t go on dates and choose things I wouldn\u2019t normally get. I would have been fine with paying.

I was dating in the late 80s early 90\u2019s and it was always a shock to the guys when I wouldn\u2019t let them pay for me.  I had 3 older brothers who drummed into my head that guys paid for dinner/activities/drinks and expected sex in return. I was raped by a cousins boyfriend when I was 14 (virgin) I was threatened into silence by him and he ended up married to my cousin so I was married before I told anyone.   I was never going to be victimized again.  \n\nNowadays I think it\u2019s even more important for women to pay their own way on dates, you are meeting people mostly online you don\u2019t know much about them and people are much more likely to ignore a woman needing help now then years ago and men statistically are more violent than years ago as well. \n\nThis is not all men so don\u2019t come for me okay\u2026 it\u2019s data, statistics.

If you were having like a soda then this is different bc it is way cheaper, but I'd be grossed out if someone had two sodas anyways) If you step outside of this norm, then you offer to split and it's no biggie.

Often times, I tell them I\u2019ve got it because I make significantly more than most of them and I\u2019m extending the invitation and want to spend time with them. I have one friend who insists on separating everything from the check, including the tax. I\u2019ve learned we go to places where it\u2019s easier to pay for ourselves separately because it makes her feel more comfortable.

It would be inconsiderate to assume that he does especially if money wasn't established or properly mentioned.

If you initially intended on spending your own money but he insisted on treating you, then you are NTA because im sure it wouldn't have been an issue for you to pay for your own things. If he offered its rude of him to complain about it when he's the one that suggested it.", "YTA.  Well, there is etiquette to guide you in this situation.  For any time a companion is paying for your meal (doesn't have to be a date, necessarily) it is common practice to pay attention to what your companion orders, and for that reason your companion should order first.  How this works in real time...\n\nYou are at a restaurant with a guy.  It is assumed that the guy will cover the check.  He orders....steak and wine.  (for example)  OK, he has set the bar rather high.  You can pretty much order what you want.  But let's say he orders burger and beer.  That signals he's trying not to over-spend.  You would be wise to order burger and beer, or something that is not much more expensive than that.  You don't have to match his order exactly, just be mindful that you don't order significantly more than he did.\n\nNow, you might wonder how this works if YOU order first, or if he signals you to order first?  Good question.  While browsing the menu, it is common to engage in small talk related to the menu.  For example, he might mention... \"The lasagna special looks interesting\".  Based on that comment, you don't know what he's going to order.  HOWEVER, you do know that the lasagna special is within his mental budget.  So if YOU order first, you order lasagna special or something reasonably close to that, in terms of price.\n\nYou ordered app, 2 drinks and salmon dinner.  I don't know how to parse that, I as I don't know what your date ordered.  To me, it sounds reasonable.  It would be well within my budget at just about any restaurant.  But I'm not dating you.  I have to go by what your date said.  He's complaining about you over-spending on his dime, so he's probably got a point.\n\nWhat complicates this issue (now) is that women are in the practice of going on dates JUST to get a free meal.  Yeah, that's a thing.  And it's quite common.  So your date may be sensitive to spending too much on a dinner, as maybe he's been burned once or twice by a date where she was only there to have  him pick up the check?\n\nRegardless, you over-spent on his dime.

You can bet his fucking is lame as well.", "Right ? The guy pay even though he doesn't want to and blame her after with passive agressive nonsense", "Right?

I feel people should just go dutch until they've become close enough that they're just naturally treating each other to meals, groceries, etc. By that time, they're familiar with each other's spending habits and priorities and so they're less likely to be an obstacle.", "I mean no one really spells it out like that, you just have to pay attention. It is a pretty commonly known rule that you should be mindful of prices and quantity when someone else is paying. A good rule of thumb is to follow what the person paying is doing. If they get another drink, you can get one too. If they say they are probably gonna order a 50 dollar steak for themselves, you know your price range.

I think I'll have one more tonight\" I would understand and follow up with a related story about how I love ginger ale on the airplane or something. But if someone is just casually getting a refill on their soda I'd be like oh this is a normal part of dining for them and that turns me off.
