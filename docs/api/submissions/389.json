Now as a condition of seeing him before he passes and helping him out financially, I asked him to sell my childhood home to me at 1/10th of its current market price. \n\n I got it cheap. I refused to dole out easy money. The house means a lot to me, It's the house my mom picked out and it's the home I hope to raise my family in once I have kids. He  agreed, albeit reluctantly, because he has no other option right now. \n\nThe sale has gone through and the house is legally mine now. The money he got from the sale will help him get proper hospice care. \n\nI will be flying out to another country in a few weeks, but his wife is insisting I stay and help her out with some of his care.\n\n His wife is accusing me of cheating a dying man of his money and being a selfish prick. But has has already seen me. I visited him and helped him out financially by buying the house. I held up my end of the bargain.\n\nAITA for refusing to engage with him any further?\n\n\n*****\n\nEdit : a lot of people has asked me the reason for the estrangement. The reason is simple. He fucked my mom over. He contributed directly to her decline and eventual death. \n\nHe and his wife agreed to my conditions. I didn't want to see him. But I did because he agreed to the sale. That was the deal. I drove to his (now my) home and met him and his wife. He wanted more from me emotionally and financially. I refused.\n\n2 : I'm not from the US, so no free hospice care.
