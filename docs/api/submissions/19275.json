I spent an hour in the water with them before it was time for pizza and cupcakes at 5:30.\n\nAfter the food it was past 6. We had to clear the party room by 6:30, so I began loading things in my car. Several of the guests left around this time as well since we had been there a while. \n\nMy wife began to worry about one of my daughter's friends who was running late. About  5 minutes before our access to the party room ended, the facility said they could still get in and play, just without us having the room. My wife wanted to stick around and let them play along with the other parents who hadn't left yet. \n\nWe had taken separate cars, and I did not want to stay. I had gone to work early that day so I could make it to the party on time. I was done and ready to go home. I made sure to load up anything else my wife wouldn't need, and I headed home. My wife and the other parents ended up staying until the place closed.\n\nNow my wife says I was an asshole for leaving my daughter's birthday early. I think she decided to stay late and is now guilting me for not doing the same. I happily spent time with my kids and made sure my daughter had a great time during the party; I don't think it's my fault a friend was late and my wife wanted to wait around. Moreover, I am not lacking any time with them.

As long as you communicated to your wife that you were leaving and there was still appropriate supervision for the children, you are NTA. If you did not communicate that you were leaving and why then that's not cool.", "NTA  another parent probably asked where you were or something and she felt embarrassed. Sounds like you were there and helped. Mom need to drag the night on when the kid is playing with friends.", "This is one of those classic moments of parenting as a partnership. You guys kicked ass at an awesome party. \nDoes you leaving at the end with the lions share of after clutter party stuff take away from your daughter\u2019s experience? No? \nThen I\u2019d say say NAH.", "INFO: Did your wife plan the party? It kinda seems to me like you're more of a guest to your own daughter's birthday party than a host. I would understand why she would want both of you there as the hosts because the party isn't over yet. I'm leaning on NAH though.", "Leaning toward NAH, because you said you had come off work and spend plenty of time with your family at other given times. \n\nThat said, I do find it somewhat strange you\u2019d leave without your wife and daughter. I know you went separately and did your part setting up/taking things down, but it\u2019s odd to me that it\u2019d be so separate. I assume your wife feels similarly and thinks you\u2019re an AH because of that. \n\nAgain, NAH, IMO.", "NTA. You were there for the set up and take down. You were there for the whole party. The only AH I see is the one who claimed you left early just because she decided to stay late.", "NTA - it sounds like you were present and interactive for the whole party, helped with set up and clean up, and your wife stayed extra with a bunch of other people because she wanted to. You were tired, did all the dad things, and were ready to get home. You definitely didn\u2019t \u201cleave early\u201d, I find it weird your wife is phrasing it that way. \n\nMe and my husband have both had these instances come up where one goes home before the other, and it\u2019s fine as long as one parent doesn\u2019t get left with the mess or in a lurch of some kind. This doesn\u2019t happen *all* the time, but in the right circumstances it just makes sense.", " NTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You attended, helped supervise the kids in the water and helped clean up after working that day. Your wife chose to stay until the place closed. She knew you wanted to leave and were leaving. She had her own vehicle and the agency to say she wanted to stay. It does not seem like your daughter or your wife asked you to stay at the time. It seems odd to get mad later.\n\nThe friend was over 2 hours late. Who goes to a kid\u2019s party 2 hours late? At that point you call and say sorry we couldn\u2019t make it.", "Did you let her know before the party that you will be leaving at the exact end time and not staying an assisting with any of the clean upduties at a birthday party?\nThat includes being responsible for the children left in your care, even if their adults aren't back yet to pick them up.", "Re read the post. He did help clean up and take stuff away. And set stuff up.", "Re read my post.  There is more to cleaning up a party then just hauling stuff.  Did he communicate he wanted to leave asap before the party?", "So a long day at work stating early, he just wanted to relax, got it", "He tidied the whole room before the party finished, put it all in the car, and the only reason the mother was sticking around was because they were told they could go and play some more. They just couldn\u2019t go back in the room.  \n\nHe also said to his wife repeatedly that he wanted to go because he had had a long day at work because he started early so he could make time to be at his child\u2019s party   \n\nDefinitely NTA"]}
