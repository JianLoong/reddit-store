But too little, too late.\n\nWere your relatives aware of the bias? If they were it's a shame that they are blaming you now. \n\nHope your mother realises how bad she messed up.", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for yourself. I would ask the grandparents and aunts where they were when you were getting bullied and treated like crap!\n\nOp you don't have to deal with people that abused you or people that enabled that abuse. \n\nBe prepared as you put space between yourself and your abusers, they will suddenly care and be confused why you have to \u2018hold grudges\u2019 , but you should continue to put your mental health first and if that mean going no or low  contact with those people, know that it's okay to put yourself first.", "NTA and dollars to doughnuts they didn\u2019t plan shit.

They never celebrated your B-day in a proper way + they created a bad experience, so it's totally understandable. It's YOUR B-day so YOU are free to do whatever you want.

You should also write down your feelings and leave it for your mom and SD to read. I doubt they will give you a chance to say it all face to face.\n\nNTA\n\nEdited to add: That's pretty much what happened with my mom and SD, except my SD wouldn't let my mom get a job because he wanted a house wife and the only money my mom received was child support from my dad, which she promptly used on my older siblings. I was the only one that still lived at home at the time and the only minor (mid-teens at the time).\n\n After I moved out and started living on my own, Christmas gatherings were always still major disproportionate. Step siblings would get 1k in items at least (if not more), I might get $50-$100 maybe. I was grateful for what I got, but can't say it still didn't sting a little. Then he later on gifted me a 10k car and my step siblings were mad (they got gifted houses) that he gave me anything like that. I never actually resented my SD TBH, I just resented my mom a little for putting me in that position. Like, couldn't she have had separate Christmas gift opening sessions? I dunno.\n\n As far as my father goes... well, I grew up wishing my mom would finally divorce him so I didn't have to live with him anymore, if that answers that question.

For survival, I suspect that you will have to offer an apology for the way you expressed yourself (I suspect you recognize that it wasn\u2019t effective), express that you\u2019re grateful for what they did do (they did do something), and that it was still painful to watch the difference between what your step-sisters received and how they were celebrated and your experiences on your birthdays.

On first read, it seemed to OP was just upset that their cake was homemade rather than store-bought and that they had to share it.", "Absolutely send what you have written to your grandparents and the rest of your family.", "Right! I wanna see the cake crumbs and discarded plates and streamers! Where is the evidence of said celebration, hmm?", "It sounds like they did celebrate her other birthdays, but she wouldn't get as expensive presents (she also has another dad) and she didn't get seconds on the cake. She seems a bit whiny to me.", "Yeah ive seen what child support payments can do to a man and its fucking ugly. RIP dad", "SD is a very cool place I agree but yeah it can get warm there. So I guess just dress light? YTA not SD.", "I'm also not seeing anywhere where OP was told there was going to *be* a party.", "Well put.", "So they either took it down fast once they realized I wasn't going to be home or like other people here suspected, there was no party.", "No, things were pretty much the same except for a different table cloth being on the dining table. I keep my phone on whenever I'm out so I'd know if they'd tried to call or text me to get home.", "Mom was getting her bed warmed.\n\nNTA", "\nHonestly I was confused too, I barely talk to my maternal grandparents and my aunt.", "It does not cost money to tell OP's bullies to cut it out.", "I hope your socks are moist, your drinks are tepid and flat, you always hit a red light, and diarrhea plagued pigeons hunt you down for the rest of your days.", "What a dumb fucking take.", "I wish we knew if it is possible for her to live with dad.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "Yeah I threw a friend a surprise party once and realized day-of that I hadn\u2019t assigned anyone to get him there. Turns out he wasn\u2019t free.\n\nAnd I immediately knew it was MY fault for not planning properly.\n\nBut the party we threw him ended up being a bigger surprise because it was four months after his birthday lol. I had a whole thing planned and we couldn\u2019t let it go to waste!!\n\nNTA, OP. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re old enough that you can leave if you\u2019re able. These people need to be in your rear view mirror.", "i wouldn't bother to correct that. disown them too for being dangerously gullible.", "I'd be willing to bet they were jealous that OP was spending the day with her dad instead of them. Like she was a possession or something.", "Those unparents didn't even call or text OP to try & get her home.  theyre really hideous.", "Exactly !!", "I kind of read it that the stepdad's bio-kids got expensive presents and were treated well by both the stepdad and mother, and probably got proper cakes.   \nWhile OPs mother had to \"cut cost\" and bake cupcakes for OP.  Nothing wrong with handmade cakes but it highlights a real discrepancy in treatment and I wonder what the financial agreement between stepdad and bio-mom were.\n\nSounds like stepdad had all the money and bio-mom was not able to spend it to make things fair between the kids.", "Word! How much you wanna bet they forgot until they heard her pull into the driveway?", "with so much stories like op or that one out there i am kinda impressed there are not way more family massakers out there.", "Omg I\u2019m happy you at least got to have a birthday with the people who love you before this happened. Huge huge hugs \ud83d\udc95 you don\u2019t deserve that treatment from your mom, I\u2019m so sorry.", "Look, at the end of the day, family is the people you choose. Sound like you've already chosen who you want to be your family.", "I\u2019m wondering if it has to do with financial issues if she wasn\u2019t placed with her father in the past. I also know some dads don\u2019t fight for custody because it\u2019s usually a losing battle in court if you\u2019re a dad. OP is 18 now, so they could go to their dad now if they wanted to.", "Good point. Nowhere to be found until time comes to blame and criticize. They certainly are there for that, aren't they. OP, can't you just live with your dad? Your mom and stepdad sound awful. It kills me that if they did nothing, you would've had a decent birthday for once surrounded by people who genuinely care for you. Instead they turn it into something about them... again on your birthday. Why do these people just have it out for you? They cant even leave you alone?", "As a wise man once probably said, the shit-apple doesn't fall far from the shit-tree, Randy.", "Yes, lots of questions", "Seeing how those people were apparently *with OP, celebrating her birthday* I doubt they did either.\n\nWhat horrible parents.", "Right? They never bothered themselves with where OP even was until she walked in the door!", "https://genius.com/Apathy-victim-lyrics", "They didn't even do the party for her. From the fact that they went crying to relatives on how she didn't fall to her knees in praise of their bare minimum, they threw the party to look good to their relatives and hide how terrible parents they really are.", "yes, that family sounds utterly disgusting treating a child like this.", "yeah kinda like that."]}
