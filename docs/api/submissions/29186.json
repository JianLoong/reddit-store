You took the effort to spend time with people who cared for you.\n\nYour stepdad and mother have only themselves to blame.\nMaybe your words had an effect on your mother of how impactful these things were to you. But too little, too late.\n\nWere your relatives aware of the bias? If they were it's a shame that they are blaming you now. \n\nHope your mother realises how bad she messed up.", "NTA\n\nYou stood up for yourself. I would ask the grandparents and aunts where they were when you were getting bullied and treated like crap!\n\nOp you don't have to deal with people that abused you or people that enabled that abuse. \n\nBe prepared as you put space between yourself and your abusers, they will suddenly care and be confused why you have to \u2018hold grudges\u2019 , but you should continue to put your mental health first and if that mean going no or low  contact with those people, know that it's okay to put yourself first.", "NTA and dollars to doughnuts they didn\u2019t plan shit.

They never celebrated your B-day in a proper way + they created a bad experience, so it's totally understandable. It's YOUR B-day so YOU are free to do whatever you want.

You should also write down your feelings and leave it for your mom and SD to read. I doubt they will give you a chance to say it all face to face.\n\nNTA\n\nEdited to add: That's pretty much what happened with my mom and SD, except my SD wouldn't let my mom get a job because he wanted a house wife and the only money my mom received was child support from my dad, which she promptly used on my older siblings. I was the only one that still lived at home at the time and the only minor (mid-teens at the time).\n\n After I moved out and started living on my own, Christmas gatherings were always still major disproportionate. Step siblings would get 1k in items at least (if not more), I might get $50-$100 maybe. I was grateful for what I got, but can't say it still didn't sting a little. Then he later on gifted me a 10k car and my step siblings were mad (they got gifted houses) that he gave me anything like that. I never actually resented my SD TBH, I just resented my mom a little for putting me in that position. Like, couldn't she have had separate Christmas gift opening sessions? I dunno.\n\n As far as my father goes... well, I grew up wishing my mom would finally divorce him so I didn't have to live with him anymore, if that answers that question.

NTA", "Ask them if they have  any pictures they have previous parties an list what gift they given op", "NTA gdt all your important documents and escape,  I'm sure this party was because now you're an adult you can start to pay rent.", "NTA, and it's hard to be ungrateful for something you were never given in the first place! I'm sorry your birthday was neglected for so long and glad that you're now 18 and can work towards leaving your mother's awful family behind.", "All parents need to do is feed you cloth you and keep you safe. I have heard stories a lot worse but I\u2019m not trying to say you shouldn\u2019t feel the way you feel. The blowup you had should have stayed in the family. It\u2019s never a good idea to air your dirty laundry. That wasn\u2019t cool and kind of says someone was looking for validation. When you have kids treat them the way you would have wanted to be treated.", "NTA \n\nyou have the right to spend your birthday with whoever you want. especially after your family neglected your other birthdays all these years. (i went through the same thing) also, happy birthday!!", "NTA. As for your grandparents and aunts either they are hearing a distorted version of events or they are truly fine with the emotional abuse and pain you\u2019ve been carrying for years. Regardless of which explanation is correct, their opinion is meaningless in my opinion. That being said, it looks like you\u2019re going to have to live with these people until you can either go away to college, live with your dad (as a legal adult, your mom and step-dad  can\u2019t stop you); or provide for yourself. For survival, I suspect that you will have to offer an apology for the way you expressed yourself (I suspect you recognize that it wasn\u2019t effective), express that you\u2019re grateful for what they did do (they did do something), and that it was still painful to watch the difference between what your step-sisters received and how they were celebrated and your experiences on your birthdays. Stop there and say nothing more - except, maybe, that you can feel both hurt and grateful at the same time and you do - no matter how they defend themselves by blaming, guilt-tripping, or otherwise tell you you\u2019re bad or wrong. They know things were different in their treatment of birthdays, regardless of their reasons. Don\u2019t bother to give examples. If they ask for them, you might consider saying that you really don\u2019t want to get into proving anything, that you just wanted to apologize for the way you expressed your perspective and hope they will forgive that. You have done and felt nothing \u201cwrong.\u201d", "NTA wt hell", "NTA. They should have told you they were having a birthday celebration for you. That you didn't know is on them.  I'm surprised that you don't just move in with your dad.", "NTA. NTA also if you go no contact with mom and step-dad after you move out. \"You had your chance and failed. Bye!\"", "Poor you, sending you my pity.", "NTA. Wtf was there to be grateful for? Now they know how it feels to be ignored.", "I'd guarantee that the relatives haven't been given a factual version of what happened/has been happening. If they have been, and are still going after OP, then they're complicit and should only be sent an accounting of the truth if it helps OP.\n\nThen again, look at the lack of communication for all of this. Did the un-parents not text OP when she never came by? Even if this was meant to be a surprise party, why didn't they ensure that OP would be at their house at a specific time, or involve OP's friends? Did they just assume that OP has no life or other people in it, since they can't be arsed to pay attention?\n\nI'm glad that OP does have a caring dad and good friends. Going forward, OP knows exactly who's in her corner, and who will use her own birthday as an excuse to make her feel small yet AGAIN.", ">  ***Do this in a factual way.***\n\nLay out nothing but facts. Things they can't deny. They will undoubtedly try to spin things as they obviously have already. There will be a lot of things they have omitted. Do your best not to be emotional.", "My guess is they felt obligated to give OP an 18th birthday party, probably because grandparents and aunt asked if they\u2019re doing anything special for her. So when OP didn\u2019t show up, they turned her into the ungrateful child. OP definitely needs to talk her relatives calmly and explain what\u2019s going on. Or send them a link to this post.", "NTA  thank heavens for your dad and friends.  Mean older siblings are abusive, and parents who dismiss their meanness have no clue the harm they do.  Anything to avoid a kerfuffle?  Doesn't matter.  What Does matter is that you stood up for yourself, spoke your truth.  I agree you can let folks know what your reality was like...you may not get the response you'd like.  Do whatever you will make you feel better, and let go of any expectations.  You are already nurturing yourself...\ud83e\udd73Bravo!\ud83e\udd73", "Hell, send everyone the link to this post and then start blocking them.\n\nNTA. Can you live with your Dad?", "I agree with this\n\nI\u2019m also wondering if OPs mother was a SAHM. Allowing husband to make financial choices which lead to his biological children getting great stuff while the stepchild to the husband gets the bare minimum. \n\nI\u2019d really encourage OP to include the gifts if they are drastically different prices for Christmas", "This", "I hope OP listens to this the most 100% this is everything", "Emails, send a proper accounting. Pop it up on socials.\n\nThese parents think it's OK to air a biased and partial account? Blast them. Let them get harassed.", "Call me the pessimist from a really fucked up family, but I\u2019d bet that mom and SD didn\u2019t even have a little party put together at all. They are just saying they had, to try to guilt OP and play the victim.\n\nEdit: fixed a word", "I don't think OP's mom cares about her. She's taken this opportunity to put OP down and bad mouth her to her relatives. Next step is to kick her out or start charging rent seeing as she's turned 18.", "OP is already doing it right, creating her own celebration and not letting the guilt trips sink in.\n\nI foresee a happy future with a supportive friend group and a chosen family infinitely superior to the one she grew up in.", "You want to know where grandma and auntie were at sitting it in the corner minding their own business. They only spoke up when the younger member of the family spoke up against the older generation. Lol", "With the added benefit of making you look ungrateful for not showing up. \n\nIt's nice of the flying monkeys to identify themselves so you know who not to count on in the future.\n\nIt sucks now, but start building a chosen family who celebrate you for who you are. It's a much healthier support system to have.", "That would require them to make an actual effort!! She\u2019s had to put up with them for years because she was a child. Now she\u2019s an adult with her own life and they didn\u2019t see it coming.  NTA", "So your stepdad wanted a housewife to take care of his kids, but refused to take care of hers in turn? That's fucked up, I'm sorry.", "I would second that motion. If possible, live with your dad. They probably won\u2019t notice that you\u2019re missing.", "NTA and make sure you tell your grandparents & aunt exactly how you were treated", "I treat my kids friends better than some of the parents posted here. I pick up my daughter and one of her friends from school every day and the friend stays with us until her mom gets off work. I keep snacks in the house that the friend likes and have bought her dinner when I got stuff for the family. \n\nSomeone asked me how much I charged for doing it. It never even occurred to me that I should ask for anything. The mom didn\u2019t ask me to do it. I\u2019m not even sure how it started to be honest. She just started showing up with my daughter.", "Or the grandmother and aunts were at the \"party\", witnessed OP didn't show up and the parents said something like \"She's just doing this to us deliberately out of spite!\"", "Those who think the truth is disrespectful don't deserve your concern.\n\nThose who think that an expletive negates years of neglect are part of the flying monkey contingent. Steer clear of them.", "This \ud83d\udc4d", "That was my first thought as well. \"Happy birthday! When are you leaving?\"\n\nOP- NTA", "Yeah, sounds like they had their heads firmly buried in the sand. God forbid they do anything when they saw OP being treated like dirt.", "I am with you on this", "The whole money aspect has nothing--absolutely positively nothing!!!--to do with the fact that both her mother and her stepfather were perfectly willing to allow stepfather's children bully and abuse without restraint or consequence. That fact alone makes it very plain that OP didn't get gifts or birthday acknowledgment because they simply don't give a flying fuck about her.", "\"Apparently they prepared a small celebration for me that got wasted because I wasn't there.\" That apparently sounds like OP had no idea about it.", "So she should have waited around in case they did change?  And what is a \"small celebration\"?  Much older siblings who never cared about her?  A stepfather who tolerated her at best?  She spent her birthday with people who actually cared about her, which is how it's supposed to be.  Maybe if they'd mentioned something in advance, she could have planned to be there, or let them know she had other plans, but as they didn't, I don't see where OP could have done better.", "You have a terrible take on all of this. :). Op is NTA. Op isn't obligated to wait around hoping they'll finally pretend to give a shit about their birthday. Op deserves to spend their birthday with people who consistently care about them and treat them with love and respect. Op doesn't owe them a mfing thing, especially not a chance to change after years of the repeated negligence.", "Found the parents.", "So are you the mom or the stepdad? Because those are the only people I can think of that would vote this way.", "Odds are unfortunately good that the grandparents and the aunt are equally culpable. They could have joined in on celebrating OP's birthday too especially milestone ones like the 18th and yet curiously they didn't. \n\nI suspect they are the maternal side of the family as well.", "Yeah I have a lot of questions on this like where does dad live that birthdays with him are not mentioned? And where did these grandparents and aunts/uncles come from all of a sudden to weigh in on this when apparently they have not been witness to the last however many years of non-birthdays?", "I doubt un-parents invited any of her friends or other people she is shown decency and love by to \"OP's\" celebration.", "Send the link to your post. Your ungrateful family deserves to read what internet strangers think of them.", "Yeah, they were probably so embarrassed that OP wasn't there (why would she be? she didn't even know they were planning anything) so they quickly spun it to be like \"Oh, she's such an ungrateful brat! She never appreciates anything we do for her!\" or some crap like that.", "They probably really enjoyed OP's party without her being there. I'm sure the steps enjoyed the food and cake and ragging on OP.", "I third it, op needs to see this", "Had the same thought. Who goes to the trouble of planning a birthday celebration, wants to be thanked for it, and can't even be bothered to text, \"Happy birthday! When will you be home?\"\n\nEither that, or they value OP so little that they just assumed that she'd have no other plans and should be so very grateful.\n\nOr something worse entirely, because I really don't understand people who can neglect a kid like this in the first place. I'm glad OP has other family that isn't this bunch.", "It's not about waiting around for them to change. But they actually did try to do something for her, and she wasn't there to even acknowledge it. Yeah, the family's history sucks, but you can't just say they're damned if they do, damned if they don't. They tried to step up, she wasn't there. It's a two-way street.", "In my experience, it\u2019s largely control and narcissism. How dare OP not sit around with bated breath, to hope on all hope that mom, and sd do something, just this once, like OP has always wished they would. Why isn\u2019t op crying in their room.   Like I said, I come from a fucked up family lol.", "They possibly did have something planned, if only because 18th birthday and there would be Looks from others if it wasn't acknowledged since 18th birthdays are such a big milestone. Although it likely would've been the literal bare minimum if they did have something planned.", "How was she supposed to know?\n\nThey could have, y'know, communicated.", "I'm tired of people say be the bigger person or two way street, those fools Neglected op for 18 years of her life and now there throwing a party for her, what took them so long, Nta op and happy birthday \ud83d\ude04\ud83e\udd73", "It *was* a two-way street.  It's not anymore.  For years, they've neglected her on her birthday and treated her like she mattered less.  If they'd attempted to change, it was on them to make her aware that they intended to do better. They are in this \"damned if they do, damned if they don't\" position because they put themselves in it.  OP had two options: sit around and hope that her mother/SD might do something significant *this time*, despite all evidence to the contrary, or take matters into her own hands, and give herself the birthday she wants.\n\nBesides, her parents didn't put any real effort into her party.  We already know her friends weren't going, her father wasn't going, her *boyfriend* wasn't going, because they were with her that night.  Probably at best another half dozen cupcakes and piddly present.", "Too little, too late. \n\n>she wasn't there to even acknowledge it.\n\nOh boohoo, so OP has to \"be there\" when they half-assed for twelve years just because \"they might change this time\"? I don't think so.", "There was 0 indication that they actually had anything set up for her and it just seems like they're trying to guilt trip her because they made a batch of cupcakes or some shit like before. Even if they did have something set up, they still don't deserve her acknowledgement. There's a chance they set something up just to ask her when shes moving out or just kick her out. She was treated as a second class citizen by even her own mom.\n\nReminds me of the book \"a child called it\" minus all of the brutal shit the kid in the book (based on a true story) had to go thru.\n\nThis is seemingly the first thing they might have done that could be seen as positive. If they wanted to step up, they shouldn't have treated her like shit to begin with. It's just too late for them to suddenly flip around and assume everything's gonna be all hunky dorry. If I were in the same position, I'd go no contact as soon as possible and not go to eithers funeral when they do pass."]}
