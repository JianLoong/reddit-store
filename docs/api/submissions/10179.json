It was not unexpected, but it has still been a very difficult time, especially since I just lost my husband in 2021. \n\nAdrian has made some money over the years making accessories and things for peoples costumes/cosplay, things like small bags, headbands, arm bands etc. About two years ago, her best friend Tina (19) commissioned her to make an elaborate embroidered jacket. Adrian agreed and said she\u2019d only charge the cost of the materials, though Tina said she was willing to pay a fair price for the work. Adrian said that either way, they wouldn\u2019t worry about payment until the project was finished, knowing that there was a chance that it never would be.\n\nI have to leave my house soon and find a cheaper place to live, so I finally brought myself to go through Adrian\u2019s room to figure out what to save and what to get rid of. The jacket was in there on a dummy. I have seen the sketches and know that the jacket was never fully finished, but it is still beautiful and wearable. She put her heart and soul in it and it\u2019s like a piece of her. But I\u2019m not the only one who lost Adrian. I invited Tina over so we could have a small memorial dinner, and then I presented her with the jacket. \n\nTina offered to pay, but I reminded her that Adrian had said payment could happen when the jacket was finished, which meant that she would not want Tina to pay for it. It was a very emotional moment for both of us as she tried the jacket on.\n\nI guess Adrian\u2019s cousins (18 & 20) must have seen Tina at some point, because they came over to ask for their money. I was very confused and they explained that they had loaned Adrian money at the beginning of the jacket project with the expectation that they\u2019d be paid back. I offered to pay it, but they said it was around 500$, and there\u2019s no way I could afford that, which I told them honestly. The cousins said that I would need to ask Tina for the money, but I refused. Tina is a struggling college student who just lost her best friend, and while Tina may or may not have had some money set aside, (I didn\u2019t ask), I know that Adrian would have wanted Tina to have the jacket for free in this situation. \n\nMy SIL called to say that I had basically robbed her children by not charging for the jacket. Her family has a lot more money than me, so I asked if she could just help me out and either give the cousins the money (I know that they often gift their children large amounts of cash), or ask them to forgive the debt, but she said that it was Adrian\u2019s responsibility, and therefore my responsibility, to pay them back. Am I the asshole for giving the jacket away for free and not asking for money even after finding out Adrian owed her cousins?", "created_utc": 1676613177, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/114c29y/aita_for_giving_away_my_daughters_jacket/", "score": 209, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's unfortunate that Adrian wasn't able to complete her project and repay her cousins, but that responsibility doesn't fall on you. \n\nI do wonder, though, if maybe the cousins actions regarding the money are motivated by hurt and possibly jealousy, maybe? Were they also close to Adrian? Because if so, I could see how hearing about Tina being not only invited to a memorial dinner but being gifted something important of Adrian's (while they were not) could spark negative feelings towards you, rooted in hurt or jealousy.

If she needed money, why would she have gone to them and not you? It sounds very suspicious, and their behaviour is unconscionable.

The fact that others are now harping on you to give them money which they claim was lent for this.  I would ask for the promissory note or some other form of proof for the exact amount of the debt involved.  Because no one lending that kind of money would be stupid enough to not have some kind of signed record.  What is sad, is that they lost a cousin which to me when it has happened is devastating.

Do you think your daughter would have told you she borrowed money from her cousins?  Sounds far fetched to me.

I'm not sure if I believe that they really loaned Adrian money for materials or not. But either way, Tina shouldn't be paying for it; Adrian made that part pretty clear. \n\nIf you have any money you can spare to pay them part of what they're claiming, offer it to them in exchange for a quit claim in writing. If they refuse, walk away without paying them anything. If they accept, do that, and then walk away with your quit claim, that proves you don't owe them any more in case they decide to take it up in small claims court or something.

How heartless can a person get??\n\nI'm sorry they are such cold, superficial, and greedy assholes. You did a beautiful thing to honor your daughter's memory, and support her grieving friend. Don't let their selfishness taint such a beautiful gesture.", "NTA. I know this goes against the modern way, but they have money and you don't. You need what you have, they don't need it but want it.

At this point it's a theft.", "I was thinkers by the very same thing. Without her daughter there to confirm this it is possible to say anything you want. \nI also think her daughter was close enough t her mom that she would have told her about borrowing that money, especially knowing it was possible she wouldn't be there for the end result. \nThe cousins are shady and sound selfish. \n\nNTA. I would go NC with them while she allows herself to grieve the loss of her husband and daughter. She is also losing her home and starting over without 2 very important people in her life.

The cousins have no claim on it", "OP did not borrow the money.  It isn't her debt.  Any agreement was with someone who is no longer alive.  \n\nUnless OP agreed to guarantee the loan, which clearly isn't the case, it is not legally or morally her responsibility.\n\nThere isn't even any proof that the loan existed.

Are you intentionally ignoring the fact that the jacket was there to be sold and to return the loan?", "I mean, you can definitely still do decent costumes for cheap, but it\u2019s also not unheard of especially when you\u2019re talking competition-level. I hand-beaded a flapper dress that definitely cost somewhere in that price range for all the beads and ostrich feathers.", "Where's the proof?", " Why would the cousins know about a jacket OP's daughter was making for her friend?", "It had been in their cousins room for two years, she likely talked about it. Probably  more than a few times given the scope of the project and how crafters are.  They probably spent time with her in her room where it sat prominently, for two years.\n\nCousins don't have receipts and are trying to get money from a relative who lost her husband and daughter within the past year?  Even if they did have receipts, what sort of ghoul does this to your relative, especially over all of $500.  Or worse, demanding that she takes back an unfinished (tailor fit I assume?) coat from her dead daughters best friend?  \n\n  And I say that as someone poor as fuck these days.  We aren't talking an antique car worth a small house, this isn't life altering money where maybe it could be justified. \n\nIt's cash, not a family heirloom of seven generations just give to a non-family member.   \n\nAnd why would the teenage daughter ask her cousin for that much money to make something for someone else?  What?  At the ages of 16 and 18 they have $500 laying around they can just loan?  \n\nAnd this death wasn't unexpected, they could have settled up 6 months ago with the person they made the deal with.  \n\nThrowing a tantrum over what in the grand scheme of things, pocket money*, demanding a recent widow who just lost her daughter, take back a custom piece of art from the daughters greiving best friend, not even TWO MONTHS YET after she died???\n\nOh hell no, that's vile and totally uncalled for.  They missed their chance to settle up, this is ghoulish.  \n\nYou know what good people do when their relative loses a family member?  They cook them dinner two to five times a week, help them with chores, be there to listen.  You give them a gift they wouldn't necessarily get themselves.   Asking for money....eeewwwww\n\n\n*like that's not even a months rent and they weren't bothered loaning it out for 2 years", "Nta, that is so incredibly insensitive of them all to do.", "NTA.

Why wasn't it mentioned before she passed?", "But I\u2019m betting if Tina is as strapped for cash as OP says she doesn\u2019t have $500 ( + if Adrian charged for labor) to drop on a jacket.

And as sad as it is, if their is an obligation of money to the cousins, it was with your daughter and no longer valid.\n\nI just don't think anyone that thinks you have any debt to the cousins deserves any consideration on your part. They are disregarding your loss entirely.", "NTA Are you sure your daughter even borrowed money from them ?     \n\nIt all sounds very fishy.", "NTA your cousin's are lying and try to profit from a death, absolutely disgusting.

It's an embroided jacket. You are completely bullshitting here.", "Yeah, I make stuff in leather. And I use only the best stuff I can get my hands on.

And you put it so eloquently, much better than I could have.", "What? No. Debts don't die with someone, their shit gets sold to pay off the debts.\n\nIf these cousins can prove they loaned the money for the jacket, than they are entitled to their money back. $500 is not pocket change.

No way.", "I am so very sorry for your losses.  Your relatives sound like horrible people.  \n\nDO NOT GIVE THEM ANY MONEY.  YOU ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HER DEBTS, EVEN IF THEY PROVIDE PROOF.  Based on what you are telling us, there isno reason to make nice with these peopple and appease them, They are vultures.  DO NOT PAY THEM", "That's not how law works.", "Actually it is -  The daughter was an adult,  As such any debts were daughters alone. When the daughter died, the debt became a debt of the estate.    Personal representative of the estate is not obligated to pay the debt from their own funds.  The Estate owes the debt.  They would have to make a claim against the estate.  The estate would pay the debt from assets of the estate.  Proof of the debt has to be provided even if the agreement was verbal.    The jacket is an asset of the estate and needs to have its value assessed.  Once the debt is established and proven, then it needs to be paid from the assets of the estate (which was arguably diminished by giving away the jacket) and therefore would need to be made up by the personal represenative if there are no other assets of the estate as she failed to protect the assets of the estate.  However, all of this will cost more  in time and money then the $500 the cousins claim they are owed.  So I stand by my advice of not paying unless and until they file a claim with the probate court.", "Oh I agree I don\u2019t think they should be asking for the money at all and it\u2019s shitty that they\u2019re making a big deal out of it."]}
