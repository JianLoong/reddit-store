And then discovered that it had been an open office until they built out private offices.  I had the cold air vent in my office and the guy across the hall had the hot air vent.  Eventually I whined enough that maintenance just turned off my vent entirely.\n\nIn retrospect, in both cases I should have just switched offices, but corporate culture is weird.", "Well then the temperature being lower obviously won\u2019t make a difference anyway, it\u2019ll only make everybody else uncomfortable as well", "If she has hot flashes then it won't matter what the temperature is, she'll still get them. From what the op has written I don't think that's the issue, I think she just prefers colder temperatures (or likes to pretend she does to exert control over people)", "Ohh I missed that", "since I started my prop my HR has gone from ~90 seated & ~130 standing to like ~70 seated and ~100 standing and I still get all the same dizziness, pre-syncope, palpitations, and pounding heart.\n\nI'm gonna be pissed if I have all the same symptoms and then added side effects \ud83d\ude2d", "my office chair at home has a space heater right next to it and honestly it's the best thing ever, even better than having the whole room set to that temp.", "It was 14.5\u00b0C in our bedroom last night and I had to put an extra blanket on top of our (13.5 tog - i.e. \"winter\" rated) duvet because I just *could not get warm* enough to sleep! Having that be the ambient temperature of the house would probably kill me..", "Why aren\u2019t you adding humidity to the air?\n\nAnd why didn\u2019t you say that over 70 is \u2018insane\u2019 in places *where the air is very dry*, rather than stating it as though it were a general rule for everywhere?", "My ideal temp is around 30\u00b0c/90\u00b0f. Luckily that's the temp here 6 months a year", "now just that but space heaters really are a nontrivial use of electricity. some can be a full 1500-2000 watts.. Thats 15 cents or more an hour.\n\nAnd a fire hazard..", "The difference of 68 vs 70 is definitely enough to make my fingers go stiff if I'm sedentary. I've had to wear gloves in the office during the summer before, haha.", "Biotene dry mouth mouthwash is pretty good! I had major dry mouth issues with some meds I was on a few years ago and used it for some help.", "ADHD meds are another one that causes heat intolerance!", "Yea that's basically what it does for me. But I also just feel less sick with the meds. Except for the heat haha.", "Wait, how does the five tomatoes work?", "My eldest housemate is very much of the opinion that \u201cif you\u2019re cold, you should put a jumper on\u201d. Like she will literally go to bed wearing a hat rather than put the heating up lmao\n\nI understand her fears about energy bills right now but she and the other people I live with go about it in such a strange way (ways I won\u2019t go into, it\u2019s long and complicated) that I can\u2019t help but wonder if there can\u2019t be some compromise somewhere", "Your can get space heaters that meet fire codes, at least in my area. But yes, most are.", "Wait\u2026 regular over the counter antihistamines or some prescription stuff?!", "Yep. I\u2019m due for some very painful and extensive dental work because of dry mouth.", "You have to pronounce to-mate-ohs the American way instead of to-maht-ohs\n\nSo \"five two (m) eight ohs\"", "> My eldest housemate is very much of the opinion that \u201cif you\u2019re cold, you should put a jumper on\u201d.\n\nYeah that works super duper well for circulation issues (not).\n\nBack in secondary I had a friend whose hands literally turned blue when it got cold, and I\u2019m not talking freezing. Gloves did nothing, it was either keeping hands at a warm location (long sleeves or straight under their armpits) or hands warmer.", "Putting on a jumper is all fine and dandy, I'm even willing to wear a scarf indoor. \n\nBut bellow 18C is about where I start needing gloves if I'm sedentary  and nope, this is where I draw the line.", "Poor you. I also understand heating cost fears, but going to bed in a hat is ridiculous. \n\nCan you get an electric blanket? They hardly use any electricity, turn themselves off and are cheap to run. It's really helped me (cold makes my pain condition worse, esp in the mornings).\n\n[Found this one on Argos](https://www.argos.co.uk/product/8886659?clickPR=plp:32:47)\n\nI also recommend hot water bottles, I couldn't function without mine.\n\nI hope your flatmate becomes more reasonable!", "Oh I need to look into that option! I work for a small company  and the important people have individual offices but then I work in a quad setting that is in direct sightline of clients that come into our showrooms so instead of it being an office that's functional it's really just for looks. Plus as floor to  ceiling windows and a skylight and it is impossible to regulate the temperature in there. Plus the desks are made of fancy wood slabs and our chairs are cushy leather arm chairs that are not ergonomic in the least. The guys are working it work out in a container and they like it nice and toasty and they have sit down stand up desks. They have an empty spot so I'm wondering if there's any way that I can get switched.", "I'm prescribed hydroxyzine but OTC stuff does too!", "Ohhh okay, thanks :) I was reading it the British way initially", "I\u2019m actually doing my best to move out right now so this hopefully won\u2019t be a problem for much longer, but if I had been staying the blanket would be a must! Thank you though, I appreciate the help! \u2764\ufe0f", "Yeah, I realise that it's a hard thing to communicate over text! \n\nOn the other hand, please have my favourite and most maddening joke, because there's no way to tell it verbally:\n\nHow do you tell the difference between a plumber and a chemist?
