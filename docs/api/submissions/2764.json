I swear the thermostat was practicing weaponized incompetence. So we gave in and switched the fecker off. It's been perfect ever since. If it gets too warm we open one window about two inches. This has been working from August.", "NTA for coming up with a solution in an environment with little to no conflict management skills.\n\nThe woman - pure hypocrite, you can be could but she cannot be warm. If she has an understanding that the wrong temperature is causing discomfort she should know it's important to find a solution both are ok with. As much as you can wear a sweater she can wear a T-Shirt.\n\nDad - what is it to be a bigger person by freezing in the office? Also denying working from home when it's in general possible gives off controlling vibes.\n\nMom - you cannot gaslight someone into being too warm or cold. If she doesn't notice the change it was indeed just about the number anyway. \n\nInteresting that she's is bugging you now that you stopped bugging her. Seems like she enjoyed you being cold and is upset now.\n\nKinda toxic work environment you're in there", "NTA", "YTA. Put on a sweater and get over yourself.", "YTA. You sound entitled. You could have worn a sweater and your boss told you to leave it alone. Maybe he knows something that you don\u2019t, like a medical condition, and he is giving her an accommodation. You never know what other people are going through and its not your business either. Instead you (and your boyfriend) decided to break company property. If the boss wasn\u2019t your parent, this could lead to termination at another company.", "YTA isn\u2019t strong enough.  What you did was straight up awful.", "YTA. I run really warm, it's difficult for me to cool down and I can get sick and dizzy. I cannot wear less clothes. You could put on a damn sweater.", "How many ppl work at the company OP? Is it just you, your dad and this other woman? I feel like all the ppl saying YTA are treating the situation as if it's in a vacuum...\n\nAlso to those saying put on a sweater...are gloves expected too? Cause cold hands can be a pretty big ussue", "A classmate of mine did something similar in school when we were young teenagers. He liked to sit in the back of the classroom with a window a little bit open for some fresh air but every girl in the class started shouting at him to close the window. One day he started to use the curtain to hide the fact that the window was a little bit open. Nobody said anything about it because nobody knew it was open.", "NTA. Well done on the lateral thinking. Point proved too when she hasn\u2019t complained about the warmer temperature.", "NTA", "NTA!\n\nWe locked the thermostat at my job because the new person tried to take over and freeze everyone to dead. He\u2019d literally set it at 63! That was ridiculously cold!\n\nNow, the rest of the office prefers the AC temp at 71-73.  To me that still cold, but I\u2019m OK putting a sweater on and even a blanket sometimes. I understand that at 71-73 works for everybody else and I can always overdress, but they can\u2019t exactly get naked it in the office. \n\nYet, 63!?? He was literally freezing everyone in the office and we weren\u2019t about to suffer that much because of the new person!", "YTA 18c is a perfectly sensible temp, as you said, if your too cold but on a bloody jumper, if its too hot she can't strip down to her pants.", "Info: are you sure she\u2019s really no longer uncomfortable at that temperature? I\u2019m wondering if maybe she\u2019s still too hot but knows it would be negatively received for her to turn it down any further.\n\nThe relevance here is that you\u2019re assuming she\u2019s just controlling, but it could be she\u2019s just quiet about her discomfort because she has a number she won\u2019t ask people to go below. It wouldn\u2019t mean she should get to control the thermostat, but it would change the dynamic here.\n\nI\u2019ll just add: my inclination with thermostat disputes is to go with the preferences of the person who wants it lowest (within reason). It\u2019s much easier to put more clothes on than to take them off, especially while dressing professionally. And I say this as the person who always wanted to thermostat set higher growing up; mg parents liked it around 62, my brother preferred 58, while I wanted 68; we kept it at 60 the vast majority of the time. It just made sense. I would never think as a new employee I should control the thermostat, but I also wouldn\u2019t ask a coworker to be miserable just so I could avoid wearing a sweater.", "Some of you youngins have never had a hot flash, and it shows. Now stay off my lawn.", "YTA, because you're being really rude and disrespectful to your coworker. Even the way you talk about her is rude and disrespectful.", "Excellent clarification!", "Yeah, no.\n\nProve it", "But she didnt notice the difference as she keeps bugging OP about being wrong with the temp. Obviously, she just wants to control something, and in this case its the thermostat", "You can't type with gloves on, however.  Most people who get cold have problems with their hands.", "There are limits to how many layers you can work in, or sit comfortably in all day.  I\u2019ve worked in offices that were set to 63F (17C) or below and it was utterly miserable.  Constantly wearing thermal leggings or thick tights gives me eczema, professional looking fingerless gloves aren\u2019t cheap, and I was still constantly cold.\n\nOne of the reasons I left that job was simply the depressing effect of having gone an entire summer without ever feeling warm.\n\nI do know how bad it is from the other side, too; I used to find 17C perfectly comfortable, and normal office temperatures rather warm.  There isn\u2019t actually a simple solution either way.  Although allowing people to swap around desks to make use of hot spots and draughts can help a lot!", "Except she clearly hasn't been uncomfortable or sweating? The temperature has been set 4 degrees higher and she hasn't noticed or complained. It's not an issue of regulating temperature to suit physical needs, she's just a controlling person.

OP changed the temperature and it wasn't noticed, which points towards the coworker being full of it.", "I have Multiple Sclerosis, and overheating can be very dangerous. It's bad enough that there's programs for free cooling vests, wristbands, neckwraps, sometimes even air conditioning units. I just bought a $300 device that you wear on the inside of your wrist, which gets cold and is meant to \"trick\" your brain. \n\nI'm that desperate to stay cool.\n\nI'm not saying that's what's happening with this woman, it's just an example of how we may not know what's going on with someone.

I have a health condition that flares up when I'm hot. There comes a point where i can't take off more layers whereas other folks can put on more layers.

There was ice on the ground and you could feel the AC running, must have been 60 degrees or colder in the office. I was having to go to the bathroom to run warm water on my hands to feel my fingers. Upon asking about it, I got told its controlled by corporate (it was also my last day) I ended up leaving a note about the horrible temperature conditions on my bosses desk with my badge and left at lunch.", "Im fortunate that since covid im one of the few people who has to come in so there are hardly anyone sitting around me and i have full control of the thermostat. In the winter i usually have the heat at around 20ish degrees celsius. In the summer i crank it down as low as it will let me which is usually 17 or 18 degrees celsius, the office is all windows so it heats up a lot with the sun coming in. \n\nMy old job i had people sitting near me who were always cold and they had space heaters (even though they werent supposed to) and i was always sweating at my desk.", "And many hours of OSHA certification have you taken?", "The only person more affected by what you did is your father.

But I wouldn\u2019t consider it unreasonable for an office to get that warm in summer.\n\nWhy do you consider over 70F \u2018insane\u2019?  70F (21C) is just a normal room temperature that\u2019s comfortable for almost everyone.  I wouldn\u2019t set a room deliberately higher than that except by agreement, but actually my office is usually set to 22C because those of us who are in there most often are all lizards.\n\nA previous office I worked at was set to 16C because the guy who had the code for the thermostat was very warm-blooded.  That was the office where I regularly wore thermal leggings and vest under a thick wool dress, chain-drank tea for the warmth, and bought expensive cashmere fingerless gloves so that I could look professional and still have sensation in my fingers.
