{"id": 14789, "submission_id": "12m3evt", "title": "AITA for enrolling my stepdaughter in boarding school despite my husband's wishes?", "selftext": "I(29F) and married to \"Sam\" (51M) and have 1 stepdaughter Laura (16F). \"Laura's\" mom \"Kate\" died when she was a baby but Sam has always kept her image alive in Laura's life by keeping Kate's family and friends in Laura's life.\n\nKate went to a boarding school when she was a teen and even went back to teach there for a while, it was the best time of her life according to videos she took when she was there and from what her family and friends told us.\n\nLaura has always wanted to go there when she was a kid but we said no as it was too far (in a neighboring country) and she was too young. But now that she's older she is more decided on going there. Sam keeps saying no, he's worried she might become distant from him living so far away, and that she might fall into bad company.\n\nI disagree I think at 16 she's more than responsible enough, and it will only be for two years. He still kept saying no and Laura was pressuring me to convince him. I kept being stuck between them.\n\nThe deadline kept coming nearer and Laura kept crying to me about it begging me so I decided to go ahead and apply (she needed me to pay the application fee) even though Sam was against it (he knew I was applying). She got in and I went ahead and paid the tuition. Sam is now very mad at me, he says I had no right and the mood around our house is intense. Kate's parents agree with me as do my in-laws but my SIL says I had no right. AITA? I don't know what to do.  How do I convince him?\n\n**Edit: I am Lauras' legal guardian so I can legally send her. Even though Laura doesn't call me mom. she and I have a very close relationship. The reason we are close is partly because I always respected Kate and her memory and never tried to take over. Kate is mom and will always be, but I'm important to Laura too.** ***Please stop undermining my role in her life just because we're not related by blood.***\n\n**One reason I applied is that if I didn't she would never get to apply again. The school doesn't accept students for older grades. So it was now or never. Sam still has till August to change his mind but if he doesn't Laura knows she has to stay.**\n\n**The other reason is that if I didn't it would damage our relationship with Laura. She has wanted this since she could remember, she grew up watching videos Kate took when she was there. It's her dream to go where her mom went, to be close to her. It's where Kate spent the best years of her life, and the last years of her life as she died only 4 months after moving to our current country and giving birth.**\n\n**If this ends up breaking Sam and me up...it's a cost I'm willing to take as long as Laura gets to live her dream.**\n\n**Edit 2: She hasn't gone yet, she doesn't go till Sept. I just applied because it was the last call for applications.**\n\n**Edit 3: Judgment is I'm the AH and fine. I accept it. I still would have done the same. This school was a massive part of Kate's life and identity. Kate spent 7 years of school there, went to a university close by, and worked at the school part-time. Then worked there full time till she had to move to our country to give birth to Laura and after 4 months she died.**\n\n**Kate's death traumatized Sam and despite my insistence, he hasn't gone to therapy for it. Sam's reasons for not letting Laura go have all to do with his paranoia toward losing her like he lost Kate. I believe I have done the best decision for Laura and these comments have only reinforced that.**\n\n**Most of the AH votes have more to do with hatred of step-parents and slut shaming me for our age difference than what was best for Laura.**\n\n**Edit 4: Logging off now. I will talk to Sam about him getting therapy. His paranoia has been an issue with him and Laura before. He even wanted to get the 360 app one time but I said no. I have to do what's best for her. If I have to pick between her happiness and him I will pick her every time.**", "created_utc": 1681490806, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12m3evt/aita_for_enrolling_my_stepdaughter_in_boarding/", "score": 135, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Laura is 16 and wants to do something that was clearly important to her mother and you helped her.", "I refuse to call someone who is helping a child do something that makes her feel connected to her mother an A H.

As a daughter who had a father who was always trying to keep me home (sheltered and over protected) I would have loved to have someone in my corner to help my battles for independence. I eventually got myself out of the situation but only after many years and a lot of anxiety later.

She was my mom's best friend and the loss was huge for my mom. \n\nWhenever I do things my aunt used to love I feel closer to her. It's not like I sit there and see her sitting next to me but going to a waterfall she felt was special and liked to sit and write next to (she was big into keeping diaries), makes me feel closer to her. \n\nYour step daughter is looking for that, she's looking for that connection. It's a warm glow and sense of calm that sits deep within you when you do things like this. \n\nYou're 100% NTA, I understand your husband's fear, there are certain OCD aspects that I can relate to.

The dad is likely feeling jealous of losing her to school for a while.", "Lol that was not what I was expecting. \n\nI am going with ESH, except Laura. Your husband sucks for not listening to what Laura wants or being willing to discuss it with her. You suck for going behind his back. I would say this even if you were Laura\u2019s bio mom.

I even see where your  in-laws, Kate\u2019s parents, and all of Kate\u2019s family thinks this would be a great opportunity. \n\nI understand her fathers reservation. He is scared he will loose her which is understandable. However if he continues to let this fear control his actions he will loose her. In 2 years she will be an adult and go away. She will always resent him not letting her follow her dream. Maybe you can sit down with him and his stepdaughter and set common ground rules. And you and him can randomly show up and check on her. \n\nI know a lot of people are saying you ah. I don\u2019t see it.

Sure, going behind dad's back is a shitty thing, but I have an over protective mother and I sure wish someone stopped her and made her see sense because it really damaged my life. It isn't just about her going to boarding school. He'll never let her go because he's always be scared something will happen to her. I'm 33 and my mom still calls and texts daily and checks on me non stop. Every decision I made in my life was a huge argument with my mom as she was against it by default. My therapist told me I'm not responsible for her anxiety and it is her responsibility as a parent to manage and live with it and not let it affect me and my happiness. That's the responsibility of a parent.", "YTA\n\nThis would be a very big deal to me, I'd be seriously considering separation.

Thanks for being a great stepmum- I hope you can get through this with a happy outcome.", "YTA.  The fact that you don't realize this makes you even more so.  You are sending off your Husband's only daughter to boarding school against his wishes?", "NAH. You are both her guardian, and it sounds like the extended family is in agreement that she goes. But the most important point is that you applied so that you would still have time to choose what she does.\n\nThere is still room to improve the situation and compromise. Can all of you go to a few family therapy sessions to discuss the fears and desires around your stepdaughter going to the school? Would he be willing to participate in that? It also sounds like this is emotional for Dad beyond the reasons he is giving too. \n\nIf not a counseling session to get some mediation, then you all can propose a \u201ctrial basis\u201d for going to the school. If he is afraid about her grades or \u201cthe wrong crowd,\u201d then stipulate that she needs to get a certain level of grades and call every week. She has a track record of being a great student and acting maturely, so this should be very achievable. \n\nIt can be very frustrating, in your stepdaughter\u2019s shoes, to feel like there is no level of perfection good enough for you to prove you can be trusted. I am so glad you stepped in so at least you all can keep the conversation going.", "As much as I sympathize with both you and Laura you cannot make this decision against her father\u2019s wishes.

Altough op didnt have the right to go behind fathers back (which actually she didnt because he knew they were applying but he might have tought that laura wouldnt get in or something) i feel she trully did what she thought best for laura. She has been a parental figure for her for a lomg time and she actually mentions that she has legal responsabilities and such so why are people saying? Just because she is a step parent she doesnt have a say? She is lisening to her stepdaughter in a reasonable petition she has. She is being the reasonable one her.  I get not stepparents are the same but there shouldnt be any bias here towars step parents. Besides the father knew. She didnt do it behind his back.

Becoming a guardian doesn\u2019t necessitate the bio parent relinquishing their parental rights/inheritance etc. either and is often significantly quicker than the long wait to be an adoptive parent - hence say a foster kid could in theory find themselves with several different guardians in a relatively short period. Whilst adoption is considered legally permanent- given OP\u2019s stated relationship it makes sense she is guardian and not adoptive parent.
