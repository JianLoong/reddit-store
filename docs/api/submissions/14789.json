{"id": 14789, "submission_id": "12m3evt", "title": "AITA for enrolling my stepdaughter in boarding school despite my husband's wishes?", "selftext": "I(29F) and married to \"Sam\" (51M) and have 1 stepdaughter Laura (16F). \"Laura's\" mom \"Kate\" died when she was a baby but Sam has always kept her image alive in Laura's life by keeping Kate's family and friends in Laura's life.\n\nKate went to a boarding school when she was a teen and even went back to teach there for a while, it was the best time of her life according to videos she took when she was there and from what her family and friends told us.\n\nLaura has always wanted to go there when she was a kid but we said no as it was too far (in a neighboring country) and she was too young. But now that she's older she is more decided on going there. Sam keeps saying no, he's worried she might become distant from him living so far away, and that she might fall into bad company.\n\nI disagree I think at 16 she's more than responsible enough, and it will only be for two years. He still kept saying no and Laura was pressuring me to convince him. I kept being stuck between them.\n\nThe deadline kept coming nearer and Laura kept crying to me about it begging me so I decided to go ahead and apply (she needed me to pay the application fee) even though Sam was against it (he knew I was applying). She got in and I went ahead and paid the tuition. Sam is now very mad at me, he says I had no right and the mood around our house is intense. Kate's parents agree with me as do my in-laws but my SIL says I had no right. AITA? I don't know what to do.  How do I convince him?\n\n**Edit: I am Lauras' legal guardian so I can legally send her. Even though Laura doesn't call me mom. she and I have a very close relationship. The reason we are close is partly because I always respected Kate and her memory and never tried to take over. Kate is mom and will always be, but I'm important to Laura too.** ***Please stop undermining my role in her life just because we're not related by blood.***\n\n**One reason I applied is that if I didn't she would never get to apply again. The school doesn't accept students for older grades. So it was now or never. Sam still has till August to change his mind but if he doesn't Laura knows she has to stay.**\n\n**The other reason is that if I didn't it would damage our relationship with Laura. She has wanted this since she could remember, she grew up watching videos Kate took when she was there. It's her dream to go where her mom went, to be close to her. It's where Kate spent the best years of her life, and the last years of her life as she died only 4 months after moving to our current country and giving birth.**\n\n**If this ends up breaking Sam and me up...it's a cost I'm willing to take as long as Laura gets to live her dream.**\n\n**Edit 2: She hasn't gone yet, she doesn't go till Sept. I just applied because it was the last call for applications.**\n\n**Edit 3: Judgment is I'm the AH and fine. I accept it. I still would have done the same. This school was a massive part of Kate's life and identity. Kate spent 7 years of school there, went to a university close by, and worked at the school part-time. Then worked there full time till she had to move to our country to give birth to Laura and after 4 months she died.**\n\n**Kate's death traumatized Sam and despite my insistence, he hasn't gone to therapy for it. Sam's reasons for not letting Laura go have all to do with his paranoia toward losing her like he lost Kate. I believe I have done the best decision for Laura and these comments have only reinforced that.**\n\n**Most of the AH votes have more to do with hatred of step-parents and slut shaming me for our age difference than what was best for Laura.**\n\n**Edit 4: Logging off now. I will talk to Sam about him getting therapy. His paranoia has been an issue with him and Laura before. He even wanted to get the 360 app one time but I said no. I have to do what's best for her. If I have to pick between her happiness and him I will pick her every time.**", "created_utc": 1681490806, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12m3evt/aita_for_enrolling_my_stepdaughter_in_boarding/", "score": 1881, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

As a daughter who had a father who was always trying to keep me home (sheltered and over protected) I would have loved to have someone in my corner to help my battles for independence. I eventually got myself out of the situation but only after many years and a lot of anxiety later. I\u2019m not saying fathers have bad intentions, but their need to be over protective is based on their own insecurities and gender bias. Your step daughter is lucky to have you.", "NTA\n\nAt first I thought you're gonna be the literal evil stepmother, but this is very wholesome.\nI think you did the right thing, it is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and if your husband has his way in the end, the kid can still not go. but I imagine the kid is definitely happy and knows that she can depend on you for support, which is nice.\nI can see that you all have your own struggles and motivations in all this, and I think you have plenty of time to see a family therapist so that everyone can see eye to eye.", ">(he knew I was applying).\n\nWhy didn't he stop you if he was against it?", "One of the exceptionally rare NTA's I'm going to give out for step parent overreach.

She was my mom's best friend and the loss was huge for my mom. \n\nWhenever I do things my aunt used to love I feel closer to her. It's not like I sit there and see her sitting next to me but going to a waterfall she felt was special and liked to sit and write next to (she was big into keeping diaries), makes me feel closer to her. \n\nYour step daughter is looking for that, she's looking for that connection. It's a warm glow and sense of calm that sits deep within you when you do things like this. \n\nYou're 100% NTA, I understand your husband's fear, there are certain OCD aspects that I can relate to. Lol. However it will harm his relationship with her if he prevents her from going. \n\nShe's looking for a connection, real or imagined that's what she wants.

The dad is likely feeling jealous of losing her to school for a while.", "Lol that was not what I was expecting. \n\nI am going with ESH, except Laura. Your husband sucks for not listening to what Laura wants or being willing to discuss it with her. You suck for going behind his back. I would say this even if you were Laura\u2019s bio mom.

I even see where your  in-laws, Kate\u2019s parents, and all of Kate\u2019s family thinks this would be a great opportunity. \n\nI understand her fathers reservation. He is scared he will loose her which is understandable. However if he continues to let this fear control his actions he will loose her. In 2 years she will be an adult and go away. She will always resent him not letting her follow her dream. Maybe you can sit down with him and his stepdaughter and set common ground rules. And you and him can randomly show up and check on her. \n\nI know a lot of people are saying you ah. I don\u2019t see it. If I am right your doing this for the the best interest of your stepdaughter which makes her very lucky.", "I'm having a hard time with this one. She wants to go just like her mom. If you are the legal guardian you in fact have a parental role. However going against her father's wishes is kind of a big no.

Sure, going behind dad's back is a shitty thing, but I have an over protective mother and I sure wish someone stopped her and made her see sense because it really damaged my life. It isn't just about her going to boarding school. He'll never let her go because he's always be scared something will happen to her. I'm 33 and my mom still calls and texts daily and checks on me non stop. Every decision I made in my life was a huge argument with my mom as she was against it by default. My therapist told me I'm not responsible for her anxiety and it is her responsibility as a parent to manage and live with it and not let it affect me and my happiness. That's the responsibility of a parent.", "YTA\n\nThis would be a very big deal to me, I'd be seriously considering separation.

Thanks for being a great stepmum- I hope you can get through this with a happy outcome.", "YTA.  The fact that you don't realize this makes you even more so.  You are sending off your Husband's only daughter to boarding school against his wishes?", "NAH. You are both her guardian, and it sounds like the extended family is in agreement that she goes. But the most important point is that you applied so that you would still have time to choose what she does.\n\nThere is still room to improve the situation and compromise. Can all of you go to a few family therapy sessions to discuss the fears and desires around your stepdaughter going to the school? Would he be willing to participate in that? It also sounds like this is emotional for Dad beyond the reasons he is giving too. \n\nIf not a counseling session to get some mediation, then you all can propose a \u201ctrial basis\u201d for going to the school. If he is afraid about her grades or \u201cthe wrong crowd,\u201d then stipulate that she needs to get a certain level of grades and call every week. She has a track record of being a great student and acting maturely, so this should be very achievable. \n\nIt can be very frustrating, in your stepdaughter\u2019s shoes, to feel like there is no level of perfection good enough for you to prove you can be trusted.

You had no moral right to do it against the wishes of her actual father.\n\nYou weren't 'stuck between them'  All you had to say, on repeat was 'this is between you and your dad, kiddo'\n\nAnd when he unenrolls her and you lose your tution money, you can take that as an expensive lesson learned.\n\nThis would be a divorce point for me honestly. He can't trust you anymore.", "It isn't really an asshole situation.  You had no right to do it, even though it was the right thing to do.  You overstepped your boundaries, because it wasn't your decision to make, but your husband was making the wrong decision.

Unfortunately his fear of losing Laura comes across as controlling and overbearing, especially now that Laura is heading towards adulthood.

At sixteen, Laura is old enough to at least have a say regarding her own education and future. And this is the best way she can feel connected with her mother...

Still  leaving dad behind. \n\nThey certainly have the economical means to send her there he is just being unrrasonable. Altough op didnt have the right to go behind fathers back (which actually she didnt because he knew they were applying but he might have tought that laura wouldnt get in or something) i feel she trully did what she thought best for laura. She has been a parental figure for her for a lomg time and she actually mentions that she has legal responsabilities and such so why are people saying? Just because she is a step parent she doesnt have a say? She is lisening to her stepdaughter in a reasonable petition she has. She is being the reasonable one her.  I get not stepparents are the same but there shouldnt be any bias here towars step parents. Besides the father knew. She didnt do it behind his back. He is just very closed mindend to realize he would hurt his daughter and damage their relationship by not letting her go.

Here international students must also have a local guardian appointed that the school contacts in an emergency and one school offered a list of agencies who can act as such reps for parents (there\u2019s a service I never knew about).   \nMaybe if your father isn\u2019t involved, your mother just signs his name or states he doesn\u2019t have parental rights\u2026 I don\u2019t know, but imagine accepting an international student whose other parent claims they\u2019ve been abducted and shipped off to your school.", "why are you assuming the husband is paying for it?", "lol she\u2019s NTA. she only applied. applying isn\u2019t the same as being able to send laura off. it\u2019s showing that one, laura was able to successfully get in with a scholarship so that school must mean something to you. 2, OP is supporting Laura because she knows this can help connect to her mom in a special way. there is actually a movie coming how about a girl who is going to a boarding school to connect with her dead mom in a personal sentimental way. the dad allows her to go because he knows the mom meant so much to them and the main character had her mom die young so she couldn\u2019t remember her like her other siblings. but it helps children who didn\u2019t get their parents to be able to remember them in a way or to resemble them. Kids want to connect to their dead parents in ways of going through their memories via travel, school, degrees. Y\u2019all just mad cause a loving stepmom cares for her stepdaughter and probably knows a thing or two about kids resenting their parents because Gen X can\u2019t handle their Gen Z kids", "ok troll", "I guess under your plan then I should just let my 3 and 6 yo do whatever they want, walk away with whoever they want.  Sorry, no one is going to harm my children", "In aus here, even before my ex and I separated I made it so the school didn't contact him at all and only one parent was required for enrollment etc", "I'm 36. Not gen X or Z.", "i don\u2019t think i commented on the right one. uh because some of this was not what i was looking at originally", "There's such a thing as a healthy balance, as I mentioned before.  \n\n\nIt doesn't sound like you understand what that means.     \n\n\nHave fun dealing with their daddy issues down the line.", "it was towards OP\u2019s husband\u2019s age.", "Oooooo I gotcha!! I was kinda wondering what my age had to with it, lol.\n\nMy bad!!"]}
