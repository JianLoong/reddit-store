{"id": 14789, "submission_id": "12m3evt", "title": "AITA for enrolling my stepdaughter in boarding school despite my husband's wishes?", "selftext": "I(29F) and married to \"Sam\" (51M) and have 1 stepdaughter Laura (16F). \"Laura's\" mom \"Kate\" died when she was a baby but Sam has always kept her image alive in Laura's life by keeping Kate's family and friends in Laura's life.\n\nKate went to a boarding school when she was a teen and even went back to teach there for a while, it was the best time of her life according to videos she took when she was there and from what her family and friends told us.\n\nLaura has always wanted to go there when she was a kid but we said no as it was too far (in a neighboring country) and she was too young. But now that she's older she is more decided on going there. Sam keeps saying no, he's worried she might become distant from him living so far away, and that she might fall into bad company.\n\nI disagree I think at 16 she's more than responsible enough, and it will only be for two years. He still kept saying no and Laura was pressuring me to convince him. I kept being stuck between them.\n\nThe deadline kept coming nearer and Laura kept crying to me about it begging me so I decided to go ahead and apply (she needed me to pay the application fee) even though Sam was against it (he knew I was applying). She got in and I went ahead and paid the tuition. Sam is now very mad at me, he says I had no right and the mood around our house is intense. Kate's parents agree with me as do my in-laws but my SIL says I had no right. AITA? I don't know what to do.  How do I convince him?\n\n**Edit: I am Lauras' legal guardian so I can legally send her. Even though Laura doesn't call me mom. she and I have a very close relationship. The reason we are close is partly because I always respected Kate and her memory and never tried to take over. Kate is mom and will always be, but I'm important to Laura too.** ***Please stop undermining my role in her life just because we're not related by blood.***\n\n**One reason I applied is that if I didn't she would never get to apply again. The school doesn't accept students for older grades. So it was now or never. Sam still has till August to change his mind but if he doesn't Laura knows she has to stay.**\n\n**The other reason is that if I didn't it would damage our relationship with Laura. She has wanted this since she could remember, she grew up watching videos Kate took when she was there. It's her dream to go where her mom went, to be close to her. It's where Kate spent the best years of her life, and the last years of her life as she died only 4 months after moving to our current country and giving birth.**\n\n**If this ends up breaking Sam and me up...it's a cost I'm willing to take as long as Laura gets to live her dream.**\n\n**Edit 2: She hasn't gone yet, she doesn't go till Sept. I just applied because it was the last call for applications.**\n\n**Edit 3: Judgment is I'm the AH and fine. I accept it. I still would have done the same. This school was a massive part of Kate's life and identity. Kate spent 7 years of school there, went to a university close by, and worked at the school part-time. Then worked there full time till she had to move to our country to give birth to Laura and after 4 months she died.**\n\n**Kate's death traumatized Sam and despite my insistence, he hasn't gone to therapy for it. Sam's reasons for not letting Laura go have all to do with his paranoia toward losing her like he lost Kate. I believe I have done the best decision for Laura and these comments have only reinforced that.**\n\n**Most of the AH votes have more to do with hatred of step-parents and slut shaming me for our age difference than what was best for Laura.**\n\n**Edit 4: Logging off now. I will talk to Sam about him getting therapy. His paranoia has been an issue with him and Laura before. He even wanted to get the 360 app one time but I said no. I have to do what's best for her. If I have to pick between her happiness and him I will pick her every time.**", "created_utc": 1681490806, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12m3evt/aita_for_enrolling_my_stepdaughter_in_boarding/", "score": 4851, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Laura is 16 and wants to do something that was clearly important to her mother and you helped her.", "I refuse to call someone who is helping a child do something that makes her feel connected to her mother an A H.

As a daughter who had a father who was always trying to keep me home (sheltered and over protected) I would have loved to have someone in my corner to help my battles for independence. I eventually got myself out of the situation but only after many years and a lot of anxiety later. I\u2019m not saying fathers have bad intentions, but their need to be over protective is based on their own insecurities and gender bias. Your step daughter is lucky to have you.", "NTA\n\nAt first I thought you're gonna be the literal evil stepmother, but this is very wholesome.\nI think you did the right thing, it is a once in a lifetime opportunity, and if your husband has his way in the end, the kid can still not go. but I imagine the kid is definitely happy and knows that she can depend on you for support, which is nice.\nI can see that you all have your own struggles and motivations in all this, and I think you have plenty of time to see a family therapist so that everyone can see eye to eye.", ">(he knew I was applying).\n\nWhy didn't he stop you if he was against it?", "One of the exceptionally rare NTA's I'm going to give out for step parent overreach.

She was my mom's best friend and the loss was huge for my mom. \n\nWhenever I do things my aunt used to love I feel closer to her. It's not like I sit there and see her sitting next to me but going to a waterfall she felt was special and liked to sit and write next to (she was big into keeping diaries), makes me feel closer to her. \n\nYour step daughter is looking for that, she's looking for that connection. It's a warm glow and sense of calm that sits deep within you when you do things like this. \n\nYou're 100% NTA, I understand your husband's fear, there are certain OCD aspects that I can relate to. Lol. However it will harm his relationship with her if he prevents her from going. \n\nShe's looking for a connection, real or imagined that's what she wants. You did the right thing.", "welcome to rock and a hard place and NTA.  This is tough as the daughter wants to do something that her mom did and would have totally supported.  The dad is likely feeling jealous of losing her to school for a while.", "Lol that was not what I was expecting. \n\nI am going with ESH, except Laura. Your husband sucks for not listening to what Laura wants or being willing to discuss it with her. You suck for going behind his back. I would say this even if you were Laura\u2019s bio mom.

A lot of his objection is likely about power over both you and his daughter. Otherwise it seems obvious that he'd give more thought to such an important, now-or-never decision.

I even see where your  in-laws, Kate\u2019s parents, and all of Kate\u2019s family thinks this would be a great opportunity. \n\nI understand her fathers reservation. He is scared he will loose her which is understandable. However if he continues to let this fear control his actions he will loose her. In 2 years she will be an adult and go away. She will always resent him not letting her follow her dream. Maybe you can sit down with him and his stepdaughter and set common ground rules. And you and him can randomly show up and check on her. \n\nI know a lot of people are saying you ah. I don\u2019t see it. If I am right your doing this for the the best interest of your stepdaughter which makes her very lucky.", "I'm having a hard time with this one. She wants to go just like her mom. If you are the legal guardian you in fact have a parental role. However going against her father's wishes is kind of a big no. So I'm going to  have to say ESH because the father is depriving his daughters desire and wish to attend a boarding school like her mom which she had also gotten a scholarship for. That had to take a lot of work on her end. You because you should not override her father's wishes.  I do hope he changes his mind so her hard work does not go to waste.", "INFO: Did you adopt her?", "You, the stepparent, went against the parent's explicit wishes?

Sure, going behind dad's back is a shitty thing, but I have an over protective mother and I sure wish someone stopped her and made her see sense because it really damaged my life. It isn't just about her going to boarding school. He'll never let her go because he's always be scared something will happen to her. I'm 33 and my mom still calls and texts daily and checks on me non stop. Every decision I made in my life was a huge argument with my mom as she was against it by default. My therapist told me I'm not responsible for her anxiety and it is her responsibility as a parent to manage and live with it and not let it affect me and my happiness. That's the responsibility of a parent.", "YTA\n\nThis would be a very big deal to me, I'd be seriously considering separation.

Thanks for being a great stepmum- I hope you can get through this with a happy outcome.", "YTA.  The fact that you don't realize this makes you even more so.  You are sending off your Husband's only daughter to boarding school against his wishes?", "NAH. You are both her guardian, and it sounds like the extended family is in agreement that she goes. But the most important point is that you applied so that you would still have time to choose what she does.\n\nThere is still room to improve the situation and compromise. Can all of you go to a few family therapy sessions to discuss the fears and desires around your stepdaughter going to the school? Would he be willing to participate in that? It also sounds like this is emotional for Dad beyond the reasons he is giving too. \n\nIf not a counseling session to get some mediation, then you all can propose a \u201ctrial basis\u201d for going to the school. If he is afraid about her grades or \u201cthe wrong crowd,\u201d then stipulate that she needs to get a certain level of grades and call every week. She has a track record of being a great student and acting maturely, so this should be very achievable. \n\nIt can be very frustrating, in your stepdaughter\u2019s shoes, to feel like there is no level of perfection good enough for you to prove you can be trusted.

You had no moral right to do it against the wishes of her actual father.\n\nYou weren't 'stuck between them'  All you had to say, on repeat was 'this is between you and your dad, kiddo'\n\nAnd when he unenrolls her and you lose your tution money, you can take that as an expensive lesson learned.\n\nThis would be a divorce point for me honestly. He can't trust you anymore.", "It isn't really an asshole situation.  You had no right to do it, even though it was the right thing to do.  You overstepped your boundaries, because it wasn't your decision to make, but your husband was making the wrong decision.

Unfortunately his fear of losing Laura comes across as controlling and overbearing, especially now that Laura is heading towards adulthood.

At sixteen, Laura is old enough to at least have a say regarding her own education and future. And this is the best way she can feel connected with her mother...

I wouldnt be surprised if when she turns 18 she decides she wants to go study to the other side of the world. Or to her mom ' s college. Still  leaving dad behind. \n\nThey certainly have the economical means to send her there he is just being unrrasonable. Altough op didnt have the right to go behind fathers back (which actually she didnt because he knew they were applying but he might have tought that laura wouldnt get in or something) i feel she trully did what she thought best for laura. She has been a parental figure for her for a lomg time and she actually mentions that she has legal responsabilities and such so why are people saying? Just because she is a step parent she doesnt have a say? She is lisening to her stepdaughter in a reasonable petition she has. She is being the reasonable one her.  I get not stepparents are the same but there shouldnt be any bias here towars step parents. Besides the father knew. She didnt do it behind his back. He is just very closed mindend to realize he would hurt his daughter and damage their relationship by not letting her go.

I think this is a NAH situation, because I frankly wouldn\u2019t want my child going off to boarding school lol, but understand yours and Laura\u2019s side as well. \n\nMy fear for your husband is what happens in a few years when she is a legal adult? She will inevitably go and start her own life away from him. Whether she goes off to university or chooses to work, travel, whatever her path is, it may not be close to home. That transition is hard for any parent, but it\u2019s made worse with trauma and fear after the loss of a loved one. \n\nI work in mental health, and I have so many patients that are on both sides of this coin. A person trying to control their loved one(s) to prevent anything bad from happening, and the person that feels smothered and lacks control because someone else is holding on too tightly.\n\nIt\u2019s an unhealthy situation for each individual and for the relationship. I\u2019ve known some people that go completely NC or low contact so they can live their lives. It\u2019s always heartbreaking because I have yet to meet a person in this boat that doesn\u2019t struggle with their decision to lower contact. They love the individual and want a relationship with them, but know that they have to keep their distance to maintain control of their own lives. \n\nAs you, and others have suggested, therapy! I think individual and family counseling would really help in this situation. \n\nI also like that you applied but it\u2019s not a definitive situation. You wanted to keep the option open and give time to think on this decision.\n\nOne activity I suggest, as a family unit, how can you instill closeness and maintain a relationship if she were to go to boarding school? The fear is she will become distant, so create a plan to prevent this from happening. Do you visit _x_ amount of times? Maybe daily phone calls, zoom, writing letters? What can be done to help maintain the relationship?\n\nI also suggest Laura and your husband sitting down and writing a letter to each other regarding their feelings about their wants. Then they read each others letters on their own and come back to have a conversation. It\u2019s so easy to become defensive and act/speak on emotion with verbal communication. A letter allows the reader to reflect, erase, and re-word things to make sure their thoughts are conveyed accurately. It also can give us a sense of comfort which enables us to be more vulnerable and honest. \n\nAs the reader, it\u2019s easier to be open minded and not be defensive. It does not solve the issue at hand, but it opens up each other to better communication, empathy, and a more productive conversation at that later time. \n\nWishing all of you the best and a resolution that provides peace for all of you.", "On the surface it seems like a Cinderella thing, and I'm sorry some commentors can't look past that and give you a fair judgment.

Find something that you can both agree to that\u2019s not exactly what you had in mind but moves you toward your goal. So, yeah, YTA for doing this over his objections. I suggest a heartfelt apology without any justification (but it was so important to her\u2026.). Then ask-  what would support his desire to stay connected while supporting her desire to connect with her mother?", "You are also unless you are the only legal guardian this is very illegal under some circumstances also when someone is traumatized you should never just destroy their coping methods as that could send them into a downward spiral. Also you are disrespecting everything that he cares about which is just plain messed up.", "EH. How far away is this boarding school? Is it several hours? Across the country? Or 20 minutes. That answer really dictates a lot of judgment. He\u2019s in his right as a parent to say no to a boarding school especially if it\u2019s far away. I think you did overstep slightly and your putting your marriage on the line here. I\u2019m not saying your an AH but walking a fine line.", "While NTA, I'm glad I dont have a wife who views her relationship with me to such a worthless toss away degree. Good on ya.", "YTA. Spin it all you want but this is a major decision that both parents should agree on.", "YTA, surely this decision should have been made together with your husband (her father)?", "YTA\n\nYour intentions are good, but he is right, you have no right to make that decision.", "I am wondering the same thing. When I first started reading I was expecting this to be another story of the step mother that\u2019s just trying to get rid of her husbands kid because she doesn\u2019t want the competition for her kids.  OP seems to have her step daughters best interests at heart.\n\nThat being said, I think that OP needs to try to understand that her husband is extremely scared that he\u2019s going to lose his daughter too. He needs a good therapist to help him through this. Just making the decision for him and kind of putting him in the bad guy position isn\u2019t going to help anything.  I get why OP applied, there was a deadline.  But now she needs to help her husband work through his shit. Well, help him find a therapist that will help him work through it. \n\nIt\u2018s not easy to let your kids go, after losing a spouse. The fear of losing a child is magnified after that kind of loss. If OP really loves her husband and step daughter she will do everything she can to find a good therapist for the whole family.", "OP didn\u2019t say that Sam married Kate right after she graduated \u2014 Kate went back and taught at that boarding school before she died. he couldn\u2019t have married/impregnated her when she was in school if she was also a teacher there", "Honestly your English is very good. I know native speakers who are not as well spoken as your reply. And on top of that I agree with your statement. OP is doing what is right for the child she has helped to grow. She has clearly done a great job while keeping the memories of the mother alive and ever present. That alone must have been a struggle. With this she has AGAIN shown that she is willing to put the daughter\u2019s best interests before her own. That is more than can be said by the father. Ultimately if he doesn\u2019t  listen to his daughter the fear that she will grow distant, or lose her altogether, WILL happen.", "Honestly I'd divorce immediately and sue as aggressively as possible. Wildly inappropriate for her to be making decisions like this. Anyone who thinks she's giving an accurate representation of his reasoning for keeping her home is delusional. We have to assume that we can't really know what's in the best interests of the child. For all we know stepmom could be crazy and just blaming his behavior on something sensitive so she can undermine him which is a typical woman move.  \nAnd if we don't know what's best for the child, unilaterally making a decision like that is like nuclear divorce grounds.", "> It's about the power imbalance\n\nProgressive redditor feminism is reducible to \"believe all women about everything always.\" There is no logic to it.", "Wow, I need to get my reading comprehension checked. I missed a whole line in one edit about the mom going to university which makes everything way less creepy. I take it back, thanks for pointing it out.", "I think she did what is best for Laura", "Thank you! I really appreciate it, and yes i fear so. I hope he comes to terms with letting her go and find her path there.", "I highly doubt she is locked up, seems like she has a pretty decent life if she can go to boarding school: and also, I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re from, but where I\u2019m from at 16 you are not an adult. 18 year olds make their own choices, at 16 you do what your parents say to do. And she is obviously a child, and children are obviously going to go with the one who says yes. But that at the end of the day is not her mother, and her father, whether she likes it or not, makes the rules until she no longer lives in house.", "Exactly! Filling out the application doesn\u2019t guarantee that she goes, but it opens the door for the opportunity. OP says they now have until September to decide if her stepdaughter can go, but if she hadn\u2019t applied for her then the deadline would\u2019ve past and there\u2019s be no chance of her going at all!!", "I'm on the fence on this one, but just because a teenager really wants something doesn't mean she should be allowed to do it. I think Sam is likely being unreasonable, but I'm not sure that's justification for her stepmom unilaterally signing her up for this boarding school.", "Great advice here. I hope OP is able to show this to the father. This all comes from a place of love and fear about losing love, but the father is probably shooting himself in the foot here. This is 100% what the daughter wants, and she only has one chance to do it.", "No worries! I was also trying to do the math in my head before I saw the university bit", "Today I learned!!!", "She signed her up. It doesn't mean the girl has to go.  That's still undecided", "Yeah I used to love this sub but now it makes me feel like I\u2019m losing it. A lot of people seem very \u201cholier than thou\u201d nowadays here", "Morality is subjective.  Ignoring what Laura wanted (especially as a way to feel connected to her dead mother) would be immoral.", "> The deadline kept coming nearer and Laura kept crying to me about it begging me so I decided to go ahead and apply (she needed me to pay the application fee) even though Sam was against it (he knew I was applying).\n\n\nThe post literally says the opposite...", "threat**   \n\n**SAY HAPPY CAKE DAY!!**"]}
