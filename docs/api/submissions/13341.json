Should you have just thrown it away if she never returned? Where do we draw the line?

The Dasher needed that food back to take back to the place they got it from to get a replacement for the real customer. My husband is a dasher and both of us have worked fast food.

You knew it wasn't your food. I would've waited longer than 15 minutes, especially since you know that issues like this happen all the time.
