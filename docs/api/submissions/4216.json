They\u2019re the one trying to change the previous agreement", "NTA", "If he\u2019s taking baby out of state you need a legally enforceable custody arrangement on file.", "You need a court agreement. Trying to negotiate this is going to make you crazy. Get a mediator.", "Sigh. No, you're NTA for \\*checks notes\\* not wanting your FIVE MONTH OLD to travel without you across state lines to Vegas for two weeks. \n\nBut the fact that you had to ask indicates things aren't great.", "NTA, it's crazy he wants to separate 5 months old baby from his mother for 2 weeks. Baby need his mother, he won't care about anyone else and it's stupidly risky to expose him to all possible viruses. Honestly I think that even next year is too early for your son to be that long away from you. Maybe when he's 3 years old, but younger kids are attached to their primary carer.", "It\u2019s not \u201canyone\u201d though it\u2019s the babies literal parent.", "Don\u2019t have children with someone you don\u2019t trust.", "That honestly doesn't guarantee the child's safety, (though, it SHOULD, in a perfect world). [Most abductions are committed by parents](https://childfindofamerica.org/resources/facts-and-stats-missing-children/) or other family members", "That is family who you can ask to get updated TDAP shots.", "How is that helpful? You know people can put on a front for long periods of time, years even,  right?", "Unfortunately I am aware of that horrible truth. I\u2019m just not reading in the post that this child\u2019s father shows signs of neither kidnapping nor child endangerment.", "Why wouldn't that be possible with dad's family? I didn't see a comment that dad's family is careless with health", "Aw I 100% agree with you two weeks is far too long, I\u2019m just wondering why op sees her ex as so incapable of being alone with his baby? If he needed supervision surely that would be court ordered? Just because he wants to take his son to see his family does not mean he\u2019s incapable at all. Two weeks is too long though.", "Maybe he likes that she is there so he doesn't have to do everything. He wouldn't be the first weapon is his incompetence. I doubt he expects to be a full time parent during the two weeks either. Probably expecting to be able to hand baby over to his mum and replace her with a beer.", "You had an agreement and although he should have an attachment with dad too, less than 6 months is still very dependent on you. Babies aren\u2019t even sure they\u2019re a separate entity from mum for the first 6 months. \n\n He\u2019ll have a terrible time so NTA.", "My daughter is 14, I separated from her Dad when she was 2, she has never been away from me for 2 weeks. That\u2019s a hard no for a 5 month old, you offered alternatives that are reasonable.", "YTA. You need a court order. This agreement sucks. I bet 100 internet dollars that next year you'll be going on about how you don't think it 17 months is old enough to be separated from you. And both holidays!  This is going to be a shit show when he tries to do this next year.", "NTA. That baby is too young to be away from Mom for that length of time.\n\nI'm assuming he's from Vegas, because I don't think kids are allowed in the casinos. But the mental image of an infant in a car seat learning to shoot craps made me laugh.", "NTA.\n\nWhy does this feel like the beginning of a story that ends in \u201cand now he won\u2019t bring the baby back to me.\u201d?", "NTA. Don\u2019t let him manipulate you into thinking otherwise. Your infant is too young to be away from you for two weeks. With RSV and other illnesses peaking, your infant shouldn\u2019t be traveling right now anyway. What is the custody arrangement?", "NTA but you don\u2019t need Reddit. You need an attorney and a custody schedule done by the courts. I personally wouldn\u2019t want my kid taken across state lines ever, but especially without an order in place. What if doesn\u2019t come back? It wouldn\u2019t even be illegal.", "Too many nos! I think a baby that age is way too young to be aware from the main caregiver! 2 weeks is too long. 400 miles it too far and freaking Vegas for a 5 month old! I don\u2019t think so!! It\u2019s a no all around", "Nta. Your baby is 5 months old. Baby deffo needs mum. This whole situation is really sad. I'm sorry. If he wanted to co parent properly he would come and stay near you!", "NTA I personally wouldn't be away from my 5 month old child for 2 weeks...he is being unreasonable...you've given him plenty of other options so he's just being an arse tbh", "Agree the father is also a parent and I don\u2019t see why he somehow isn\u2019t able to take care of his own kid. \n\nI assume op is American and I probably have a ton of prejudice on how overprotective American moms are and how helpless American fathers are in handling their kids.  \u2026but I\u2019m also from a culture where most mothers stop breastfeeding around 6mo and most fathers steps in to take over the parental leave for the next six months while the mom goes back to work. Both parents needs to bond with kid equally.", "My daughter was 19 months when I first spent an evening away, and I was back that night. She's now 2 and I'm just warming up to the idea of letting someone take her overnight - maybe I'll be ready in another couple of months \ud83d\ude05", "His moms wants don't matter, the baby's needs do. If mom is his concern, definitely no.", "Sounds like it's a bit late for that, hm? Yes, my leg would be feeling a whole lot better if I hadn't fallen out of the tree, I'll be sure to not have done that.", "Almost 50% of children of children born in America are unplanned.\n\nGet real. Birth control failures, abusive relationships, no protection, stealthing rape, plain old rape, anti-abortion laws\u2026\n\nSo many reasons why people end up having children with someone they don\u2019t trust.\n\nWhat a shitty and ignorant thing to say.", "Huh? Did you not read the comment chain? Or perhaps you responded to the wrong person?", "That\u2019s fair. Good point. Some people are master manipulators.", "Wanting to take an infant on a cross country trip with respiratory illness at an all time high is child endangerment and also stupid.", "Most people don\u2019t suspect their ex to be a potential kidnapper or they wouldn\u2019t let their kid go on their visitation.\n\nDo you think all these parents were aware that their family members were going to kidnap their kid?", "It's an analogy - there's not a lot of point in telling somebody \"don't do the thing you clearly already did\"."]}
