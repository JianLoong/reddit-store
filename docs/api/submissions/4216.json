This seems to be a recurring theme on AITA of people throwing a tantrum over the holidays. Your child is still a young infant, taking them away from their mother for a prolonged period of time in a new location when dad\u2019s barely had 3 unsupervised days with them seems totally unreasonable for the baby and for you.

Also no way that baby needs to be traveling all over the world (in a pandemic!!) That would be traumatic and he already agreed to this set up so it's his problem if he changed his mind. You definitely need to stand your ground with your child especially if you do not have a formal custody agreement in place. The time for negotiation and compromise is when you're making these decisions together, not two weeks out when he decides it's not fair bc it's not going his way. Stick to the agreement, don't let him manipulate you into going back on the decision you both agreed to, and for the love of god please call a lawyer and make a formal custody agreement. whatever your situation with him is romantically, you are co parents first and you need firm boundaries around this kind of thing so no one is arguing over the child.", "NAH.

That is the primary and most important point of the entire post. What's he going to do, teach the infant to play poker or something?  Frankly you need to get this worked out legally and he should not be able to remove the child from your immediate area for any amount of time at all before he's at least 18 months old.  And the whole \"state lines\" thing needs to be addressed because you don't want to have to fight that war.  He certainly should not be allowed to take a baby into high exposure environments unnecessarily--children's hospitals are running out of beds because of all the crap out there, so you are quite right to be concerned.", "Info: would you have any problem taking the baby away from his/her father for two weeks straight?

Thanksgiving, one of us get the actual day (usual me cause they all work retail and I get holidays off) the other does their dinner the following Saturday. \n\nChristmas, one gets eve and the 4 days before, the other gets day and the 4 days after.... this is especially useful for school age when they get a break around the holiday....

It also sounds like you are controlling and not giving him his full visitation.
