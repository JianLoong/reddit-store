I get it and understand. A ten year marriage is a long time to throw away, but I was married to someone for years who mentally and emotionally abused me. He demanded that I hand over all of my money to him and would never let me have a dime. He told me my money was his to do what he wanted with it, threw away all of his money on drugs and god knows what else, and even controlled the finances and hid them from me while he paid none of the bills and lost every place we tried to live in, forcing us to constantly be evicted. I wanted to get a job at the time but couldn\u2019t because he took the only vehicle we had at the time and never allowed me to go anywhere, not even with him because he was too busy meeting up his drug buddies and wanted to keep it a secret.\n\nYour situation is not as extreme, but your husband is also abusive. He is controlling and entitled, he is extremely critical of you and doesn\u2019t respect your life goals or even any of your wishes.

GOOD. GAWD. Your husband is not only TA in this instance, but I'm getting major general-AH vibes as well. If your family's/household's finances are separate, he had zero right to demand you foot the bill for a (huge!) non-essential purchase. If your finances are considered by both of you to be pooled, I question why he only \"allows you\" the bare minimum to cover household essentials. \n\nEven putting aside the 10 gallon bucket of marinara that is him DEMANDING a friggin thing from money you earned doing something he pissed in your cheerios about in the first place, I have massive concern as to why you don't know \"anything\" about your family's finances. It's not uncommon for one person to be the designated money manager in the relationship, but that absolutely does not negate your right (and responsibility) to know what the hell is gong on with any and all accounts for your family. \n\nTl;dr: He's being an entitled brat at best, and perpetrating financial abuse at worst.

(Even if he's paid for costs like your clothes etc. there's still quite a chunk missing in wages).\n\nYour husband doesn't let you in on *his* finances, so you have to live in uncertainty about your and your kids future, and I don't think that's right. He should be open about things like that. Have you ever seen a bank statement? Do you know his internet banking password? You really *ought* to know!! He's really secretive about it and shouldn't.\n\nYou really, really need to discuss those things with him before anything else.\n\nIf I werre you, I would open a bank account in my own name, put the money you earn from writing books in there and not tell him your password or anything about it.", "NTA.\nAgree to share household expenses but bill him half the housekeeping / childcare hours.

The fact your husband is obsessed with budgeting and his first thought upon learning about your success wasn\u2019t to congratulate you but to demand a huge purchase for himself says to me he\u2019s more interested in money than he is in you.

If that\u2019s so, I would say she should just take her money and her children and just leave him.", "1. Where did she lie?\n2. We're not in the 1950s anymore, women are allowed to borrow money from their sisters without asking their husbands.", "Honestly, I only borrowed money because he wouldn\u2019t have give me money for an accountant even if I paid it back. He\u2019d just think it\u2019s silly and he would say that he can take care of the money. This is exactly what he said when I wanted an accountant to manage my inheritance years ago.", "They should not go to couples therapy because he is an abuser. She should use her advance to hire a divorce lawyer.", "Oooo anything we would all know???", "And I made sure the money went where Greg couldn't touch it. Preferably in the pocket of a divorce lawyer.", "Nobody joins a cult and nobody enters an abusive relationship. Just because YOU don't understand the psychology and trauma around these things doesn't mean Reddit is wrong, it means you are.", "But she's not just taking a childcare role. She's been a housekeeper, a chauffer, a nurse, a chef and countless other responsibilities. How many people would he have to hire to seamlessly fill her place in the family?", "I'm not saying medium wage for childcare. It's medium wage according to Google Search. \n\nI agree that buying him a car is ridiculous.", "And how does he pay her for half of the child rearing, cooking and cleaning that HE DID NOT DO!   \n\nBy her being a SAHM, she has paid nothing into social security, a 401k  or IRA.  So ONLY he gets to benefit financially from the marriage while she got stuck with all the work of kids, cooking, cleaning, shopping, laundry.\n\n And tell me, how many days off a week did she get?  None, she had to work every single day without a day off for 10 years.", "Bottom line she is doing work that needs to be done and if she didn't do it then he would have to do it or pay someone to do it. If they both worked outside of the home someone would have to take off when a kid is sick, deal with school drop offs, pick ups, delays, attend to daily emergencies etc. If you have someone at home who can take care of those things it puts you at advantage at your job. You don't have to take unplanned days off, you're available to volunteer for projects or assignments, and over all your only major responsibility is your job. It's hard to know if he would be in the same financial situation if his wife worked outside of the home but most likely not. The money he has is directly related to the fact that he has not had to pay for child care for 10 years. Meanwhile, the wife is ONLY allowed money for household needs and has no idea what their accounts even are. I agree that if his money is family money then hers is too but buying him a car is not for the family is it? I think she should give him the equivalent of what he has given her over the years- fucking nothing.", "He's not giving her money for anything but household expenses so he is \"supporting\" her at the bare minimum. Her money shouldn't be family money because she was never allowed to use that money for herself like he wants to use HER  money for HIMSELF. He also never supported her writing, telling her it was a waste of time, while she definitely supported the whole family with her domestic labor.", "There you go. That just further reinforces that you're NTA.", "and I'd argue any argument that he \"supported\" you during your time as a SAHM ignores the fact that fact that you've had 5 kids in 10 years.\n\nThe amount he'd pay for childcare alone over those 10 years...yeesh.", "Yes, he wants you to be bereft. This money gives you options. Options that you wouldn't have as a  penniless SAHM with 5 daughters to support and 10 years out of the workforce. If your advance were $250,000 he'd be asking for a McLaren. \n\nThis money is your ticket out. He will take all of it and leave you with nothing if you stay.", "Your not the ah he's been greedy", "These are issues that should have been addressed long before 5 kiddos and her agreeing to be a SAHM. It's one thing to go into a marriage blind of finances when no children are involved. Here she is, 10 years later, raising 5 kids with no idea how much money they have or how much he makes. Their \"comfortable lifesyle\" could be all debt as far as she knows (especially if he isn't willing to finance an expensive car on his own). That makes her part of the problem.", "OP, everything you\u2019ve said here is alarming and points towards abusive behaviors. Do not give him a dime of your money. And please have a hard think on whether this is the way you want to continue living your life.", "This is alarming. He's abusive. If your books succeed and you earn even more money, your marriage will end, or you will have to give it all up and pay him.  \nHis goal is to control you, and he managed to do so for 10 years. Any time you try to get more freedom and/or independence, he sets you back. \n\nBe wise.\n\nNTA.", "This needs to be included in the post. I was slightly leaning towards ESH because you hid the money but turns out he was doing the same. Normal marriages don\u2019t work like this. \n\nThis is clearly financial abuse. I am sorry OP. You need to start looking for help. Idk if something like this is recoverable with couples counseling. \n\nEither way it\u2019s great that you have resources to get out. Keep it that way.", "Can you add this to the post? Important stuff here.", "NTA oh girl get a grip on yourself and leave this abusive, entitled arshole!!!\n\nSo you keep having kids, cuz he wants them, probably to keep you busy and not going to work, making you completely dependent on him,  he won\u2019t give you money outside household expenses\u2026you don\u2019t know how much he makes, he has his own savings that you don\u2019t even now how much\u2026. This is ABUSE!!\n\nNow when you came with some money he actually wants you to spend almost  everything on him?? WTF???\n\nHe wants new shiny car and he wants you without the money again so he can control you, if you have the money you are danger to him to his control over you!!\n\nAnd where is your inheritance???!!!!\n\nAre you going to let your 5 girls to see and learn that this is how men behave towards women, do you wanna live in this jail that your house has become!!\n\nLeave for god sake, leave a be free, now is the time, some things happen for a reason, you getting the book deal which gives you freedom and effin universe showing your husbands true face when met with your success, give yourself a chance to live free and breath again!!!", "Anytime you have a man who insists on a woman staying home, not earning and not showing you the family finances it's to control you.  \n\nDo not give him one penny and get a good lawyer.  You may want to rethink this relationship as well. Abuse has many faces.", "You aren\u2019t even a bang maid, you are treated as a trafficked individual.  Divorce him now.", "Pay close attention to your birth control or he might tamper with it to force you to get pregnant again.", "What happened to your inheritance?", "What does he do with all his money. He gives you barely enough to get by. Is he on a low income?", "Why did you allow him to take care of the money? That seems like a wildly foolish decision?", "Maybe! But my lips are sealed. LOL.", "Exactly, that advance did two amazing things for her: 1.) showing that her husband wasn't just being 'frugal' with 'his money', he was being financially abusive the whole time; and 2.) gave her a parachute to leave now while she can.", "I really can't stand when people try to equate parenting to a paid job.  You chose to have children, you shouldn't be 'compensated' a salary for choosing to have kids, it's ridiculous.\n\nThat said, I'm seeing some signs of financial abuse here and she should for SURE set that aside for herself.", "\n> He will take all of it and leave you with nothing if you stay.\n\nThis needs to be shouted from the rooftops!", ">These are issues that should have been addressed long before 5 kiddos\n\nYeah, Op should have washed her eyes with water and seen ten years into the future with this asshole", "Take a wild guess. I\u2019m sure I know.", "I would also like to know this information!!", "Pissed it all away on his last new car I\u2019ll bet.", "It's not for choosing to have kids, it's the equivalent that a partner would have to pay to receive the same value if it weren't being done. If she left entirely or died suddenly, it would cost him a lot of money to replace her as full time childcare, chef, and house cleaner.", "Hard agree. Should my husband pay me a part time chef\u2019s salary because I do most of the cooking? Pretty sure all of those things are standard adult responsibilities.", "Maybe not ten years into the future, but there def had to be red flags before then. It's just not realistic to believe your bacon bringer is immortal, and there is zero backup plan if he were to get abducted by aliens tomorrow.", "Thats reaching.  DIsagree, when you chose to have a family, you know its not  paid job.   If he died, what would she have to do to make up his earning the home income?"]}
