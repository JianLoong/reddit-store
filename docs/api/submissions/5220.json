He told me my money was his to do what he wanted with it, threw away all of his money on drugs and god knows what else, and even controlled the finances and hid them from me while he paid none of the bills and lost every place we tried to live in, forcing us to constantly be evicted. I wanted to get a job at the time but couldn\u2019t because he took the only vehicle we had at the time and never allowed me to go anywhere, not even with him because he was too busy meeting up his drug buddies and wanted to keep it a secret.\n\nYour situation is not as extreme, but your husband is also abusive. He is controlling and entitled, he is extremely critical of you and doesn\u2019t respect your life goals or even any of your wishes.

GOOD. GAWD. Your husband is not only TA in this instance, but I'm getting major general-AH vibes as well. If your family's/household's finances are separate, he had zero right to demand you foot the bill for a (huge!) non-essential purchase. If your finances are considered by both of you to be pooled, I question why he only \"allows you\" the bare minimum to cover household essentials. \n\nEven putting aside the 10 gallon bucket of marinara that is him DEMANDING a friggin thing from money you earned doing something he pissed in your cheerios about in the first place, I have massive concern as to why you don't know \"anything\" about your family's finances. It's not uncommon for one person to be the designated money manager in the relationship, but that absolutely does not negate your right (and responsibility) to know what the hell is gong on with any and all accounts for your family. \n\nTl;dr: He's being an entitled brat at best, and perpetrating financial abuse at worst.

If you want to stay married, you each should should get your own attorney, & make a post-nup. Then see a marriage counselor, minister, whatever. How sad to be in a legally binding relationship with no trust, honesty, communication. What kind of example are you setting for your kids? Is this the kind of relationship you want for their future? Kids learn what they see. Try to model a healthier relationship for them.", "Were we married to the same person? Mine did all of that and if I kept my check, he'd just take it.  No matter where I put the money.  It got so bad that I had to ask my boss to just pay the daycare directly from my pay, which she did.  She also helped me escape and made sure that her police officer husband had an escort from the courthouse parking lot to the building and back for each court date and red flagged my address with 911 to make sure that if I did call, they showed up super fast. That woman saved my life", "Agreed!!! OP has a resource not a lot of people stuck in abusive relationships have - money! Use it to leave!!!\u2019", "OP, I don't know whether he's concealing his assets from you, or concealing his debts, but it's one or the other.\n\nAs others have said, make sure your advance is someplace he can't get it, **which means a different bank.** Don't buy him a car. Talk to a lawyer.\n\nYou are not the hired help. Exactly what your legal rights are will depend on where you are, but as a SAHM you are contributing to the household, and you will find you do have legal rights.\n\n**Please** talk to a lawyer.", "Make up an invoice for what a SAHM would make by charging per hourly rate.Charge him for all ten yrs and per child. Then hand him the invoice and tell him he has 3 options \n1.)pay amount on invoice for your time spent taking care of kids, cooking and cleaning \n2.) go to marriage counseling \n3.) go to hire an attorney", "Agreed. \n\nHe is financially abusive. \n\nOP needs a divorce lawyer.", "This! He wouldn\u2019t be where HE is if she hadn\u2019t been home all this time making it possible. OP, he has this backwards. Also- what kind of spouse gets the news that their partner had a great success that they\u2019ve dreamed about and responds with \u201cBUY ME STUFF\u201d? \n\nOP, you\u2019re NTA. You should have access to the accounts. If your money has never been jointly managed before, there is no reason that the first time you have money of your own you should have to use it on him for something frivolous. \n\nCongratulations! Good luck!", "NTA. Do not give him access to this money at all. And think carefully about whether you want to stay married to him. He is financially abusing you and will not stop. I wish you strength and luck.", "Comment stolen from u/cookies_squeaky and for some dumb reason made to sound like it came from OP?!?\n\nu/Educational-Desk-253 is a very odd bot.", "OP literally says she wrote the book in her free time. 5 minutes here and there. \n\ntrying to say that her doing so, her daring to have any bit of free time in TEN YEARS somehow means she didn't contribute 100% is beyond shitty. \n\nand he may have 'contributed 100% of the finances' but if he wasn't able or willing to allow her to have any money outside of things for the house, then he did a piss poor job of it, meanwhile she's there actually raising 5 kids and managing full house which is a 24/7 job while he dismissed her hobby as a 'waste of time' and never told her anything about their finance situation despite her being his partner. \n\nYou sound like someone who views SAHMs as free loaders.", "Hello sister in 'Hey didnyou know divorce is a for profit business?' Club.\n\nI was institutionaly and bureaucraticly abused in the military 32 years ago I know exactly  what it looks like.\n\nI'm in U.S.-California and on whole new levels I see how broken and unjust our court systems are.", "This, OP. You\u2019re living with an extremely controlling man. I can\u2019t even call him a partner because he clearly doesn\u2019t treat you as one. You\u2019re a free maid and nanny for him that just happens to be related to his kids. \n\nI pretty much knew my husband\u2019s finances while we were dating. He\u2019s the breadwinner and I\u2019m a SAHM. I haven\u2019t worked since graduation and I don\u2019t manage the finances cause I\u2019m lazy but he will definitely tell me if I ask and sometimes actively tells me even if I\u2019m only half listening. He also wouldn\u2019t ever call it his money.", "Excellent reply, LAWYER UP NOW!", "I know who you are talking about. It was really sad to see what had happened to her. I enjoyed her series but unfortunately haven't read anything since she wrote the story about main character newly discovered brother. \n\nI hope she finally got everything settled. I really should pick up the series again. I really loved the first book and would love to see those characters get more of a story.", "This!\n\nIt will never get sustainably better.\n\nBut it can and will get worse.\n\nDon't expose your children to that. It is ruinous to humans.", "YUP, I am sure Greg chose that extremely expensive car just to deplete her money so she is back to being dependent on his money and he can continue to control her. OP GET OUT.", "I have been a stay at home mom for all of the almost decade I've been married. My husband brought up being shocked that financial abuse was *a thing*. He's so innocent he couldn't imagine not giving me full access to our money because it's *ours*.\n\nOP is being controlled and manipulated.", "Thank you! My spouse, the main breadwinner, isn't an asshole, so I don't need to remind him of my contributions to our household and lifestyle. But it is simply a fact that if I weren't a WAHM, he'd have to pay for childcare in some form. One of our kids just developed a fever, and it's no issue (other than that I hate seeing him under the weather) because I can stay with him. And my spouse would have to juggle many more balls. Could he do it? Sure. Would his life be harder? Also yes. He's not supporting me, we're working together as a team.", "I hope she'll be ok! But definitely abused!", "NTA \n\nIs your husband aware of the term \u201csweat equity\u201d? Because that\u2019s what you\u2019ve been contributing this whole time. And where is he squirrelling away all the rest of the money? Or does he always buy what he needs when he needs it while you go without always making sure everyone else has exactly what they need?\n\nAlso, a car is literally THE WORST use of a windfall (unless you have a totally useless car that is rundown and constantly costing money). Cars depreciate the moment you drive them off the lot. And it\u2019s YOUR book and YOUR advance. What possible benefit could you get from him getting a new car? Shouldn\u2019t you be able to have the main decision about how the money is spent? Since it sounds like he does with the money he earns. \n\nI\u2019m so angry on your behalf. He is behaving appallingly selfish!", " NTA. your husband is insane", "Get out of this relationship, immediately   \n\n\nThis guy has a malignant psychology that can't be fixed by therapy or reading a self-help book  \n\n\nHe'll only ever get worse, not better", "Exactly this! \nOne cant have a career when the other isn\u2019t at home with kids (if the kids are small)", "Right! When I was a stay home wife, I had full access to my husband\u2019s account and did all the budgeting.", "I agree! Im always surprised when that kind of couple gets a divorce and the \u201ccareer\u201d partner thinks the other does not deserve anything, because they \u201cgot\u201d to stay at home and its not their money.", "Definitely agree. I read ALOT, like around 200 titles a year so I'm down to add to my list. I'll go one further and purchase ebook, paperback, and hard cover/audio to get OP away from her awful, unsupportive husband.", "Which author? I've not heard about this before", "He owes you, in fact, for all that labor.", "I\u2019m wondering the same", "We all hate Greg", "I bet he doesn't even realize that it's his problem that they don't have a boy."]}
