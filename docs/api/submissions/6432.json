This woman is a professional photographer, and was very formal in terms of our communication throughout the process. However, after the wedding, she didn't acknowledge the tip I sent her via Venmo, and stopped responding to my text and emails. I only texted twice and emailed once, as I knew the Thanksgiving holiday was coming up soon after our wedding, and I didn't want to put much pressure on her in terms of editing our images. After a couple of weeks I became concerned that she didn't receive the extra payment and about the lack of communication in general, so I asked my SIL to get in touch.\n\nMy SIL said everything was all good with her photographer friend, and that she was still editing the images. The day after I spoke to my SIL,  I received a Christmas card from my brother and SIL that was clearly a professional photograph FROM MY WEDDING. After asking my SIL, she said her photographer friend sent her the pic about a week before our conversation and confirmed that she hadn't sent any sort of payment for extra photos,. I was pissed- I didn't receive any sort of \"friends and family\" discount from this woman, and she sent the pictures that I had paid for to my relatives without even bothering to answer any texts or emails from me. We were recently at a holiday party together, and I called her out in front of a couple of people, saying that I was so surprised to receive a picture from my wedding in a Christmas card when I hadn't even received any sort of correspondence from her at all when I was the one who paid for the pictures. She said that I was \"insanely rude and dramatic\", that she and my SIL were close friends, so of course she would send her a cute picture of her family while she was going through the editing process. I told her I would have loved to use my own wedding photos for a Christmas card, but it was too late at that point. She gave a snotty half apology while rolling her eyes, but basically blamed me for not telling her that I specifically wanted a picture for a Christmas card. My SIL is annoyed at me for saying anything to her friend now, too, and has me wondering, AITA?", "created_utc": 1672793041, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/102oyjq/aita_for_calling_out_our_wedding_photographer/", "score": 670, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

That's not professional behavior on her part to not communicate. The editing process can certainly take a long time, depending on how many photos were taken, but she should at the very LEAST be responding to your questions. \n\nBeing a professional is more than having nice equipment and a good eye.\n\nAnd on top of all that, giving out even a single one of your photos to someone else without your permission is just... wow.

Yes, wedding photos usually take a time to edit and get back, but the lack of acknowledgment of Tom the money your sent and lack of communication back to you is very unprofessional!! The photographer clearly edited at least of your photos if she was able to send it to SIL so why no communication back to you, a thank you for the tip, nothing?! She deserved to be called out", "NTA. Absolutely nobody should have received pictures from your wedding before you and they especially shouldn\u2019t have received any if they didn\u2019t pay for them.

That and her lack of communication.  After you get your photos, I'd leave some less than stellar reviews.\n\nMind, if she clearly abrogated your contract by giving away one of your photos, you should look at your legal options(AFTER You get your photos).\n\nEDIT TO ADD: Saw comment--you have photos and are happy with them.  That's good, but I'd still call out her unprofessional behavior in reviews and check your contract for the legality of her giving away your pictures.", "NTA\u2026you paid for a service and have been disregarded ever since AND the photographer gave away some of the photos you paid for!", "NTA\n\nAt the very least, as a family friend and knowing you would likely see the Christmas card, it should have occurred to her to provide both you and SIL with a photo preview. BUT even that I would consider unprofessional without consulting you first and what you wanted.

Each wedding photographer if professional as you say comes with an agreement to sign.  Usually the recipient gets full rights to photos so her giving it to your SIL was very passive aggressive.  Also a tip is not required to do legally in order to receive services unless specified in signed agreement.  However I find there is some missing context to this story.  Where is the venmo receipt to show her?  You can take her to small claims court to get your full photos back.  All venmo purchases not only has a tracking program on the platform its self they sent you a receipt in your email.  Take that receipt (if this went down that way) and send it to your wedding photographer and to your sil.  I have a feeling your SIL and wedding photographer both had a play in this.", "Barely NTA - Calling her out at a party was a bit much...you learned about the pic your SIL got well before -- I would have IMMEDIATELY called her directly and tore into her.  I think SIL is defending her friend - it'll be hard to get her to see why you are offended, but willing to bet if her wedding photographer had done the same to her -- she wouldn't have been happy either.", "ESH. This photographer should have been in touch with you to thank you for the tip or give you an update on the status of the pics. She should NOT have provided one to your SIL without running it past you first.\n\nFor your part, you admit in the comments that you eventually received the pictures within the contractual delivery window and that this confrontation occurred when you were tipsy.  When you saw SIL's Christmas Card, it was the perfect excuse for you to \"be the pest\" by calling up the photographer, saying you saw the image and it looked great, and asking when you could expect delivery.  You  could have even asked for your own Christmas card pic. Instead, you silently sulked.\n\nYour SIL isn't a huge AH (she gave you an update when asked, she was truthful throughout) but shouldn't be surprised that when you push family to use a friend's services, sometimes things go south.", "NTA. I shot a wedding last summer for a friend of my SILs (SIL was a bridesmaid, her fiance was best man).\n\nAt the wedding, SIL asked me to take a photo of her and her fiance. Before taking the photo, I took all the photos the bride wanted, and double checked that it was ok with her. I snapped the photo in my downtime (scheduled break).\n\nBefore sending it to my SIL, I made sure to have the client photos completed and sent.\n\nI had also discounted my services heavily for this couple.\n\nAs a photographer, I have no issue grabbing extra photos - with the permission of the couple, and during my break time so I don't take away from the paying clients. I will never make the editing of those photos a priority - my paying client comes first. It would be extremely unprofessional to make someone else a priority over my paying clients.", "YTA and your SIL sucks too.\n\nThe photographer is not TA. \n\nI can understand why the photographer would send your sister a photo while editing. I can understand why the photographer dropped the ball on communication during the busy season(dont you have a contract with timeline expectations?). I can not understand your SIL using that photo as her Christmas Card without checking with you. Maybe she did not realize you did not have any pictures yet. I also cant understand why you got snarky with your SIL friend, who did not put your wedding picture on her Christmas Cards.

That's fine, but then you should be getting totally professional service.

It doesn't matter if they're friends or not. At this point if she's giving a free copy of the photo, that means the rest of the photo should be done and edited by now.

That\u2019s why I said if it was planned it would be worse. \n\nI got married this year and wedding photographer\u2019s are expensive. It\u2019s not just the venue. You also typically pay the photographer for a specific number of hours, 6, 8, 10. And in most cases if you want more than that, it will cost extra. And the schedule is tight, there is typically not a lot of extra time to take family pictures that are not requested by the couple getting married. So it\u2019s not realistic that an extra family picture, taken at OP\u2019s wedding was taken during the photographer\u2019s free time.\n\nIf someone thinks that someone else\u2019s wedding is a good time to take extra family pictures, and they don\u2019t ask first or pay offer to pay for it, then they are demonstrating either a high level of selfishness or a lack of awareness of the money and logistics that go into wedding photography.", "I think you're missing the point you don't plan to use someone's services when they are booked for someone else", "If everyone consents, how is it worse. I already said about telling/asking first.\n\nAnd I know some have a thighs schedule but others have extra time. You're not taking photos the whole time.

If she's self-employed, you pay what she charges you and same for everyone else on your list.\n\nTipping the person who delivers the flowers is appropriate; same with the hair stylists if they don't own the business.\n\nTipping is out of control.  <end of rant>", "You don't tip the owner of a business.  As you said, the owner sets the price.\n\nIf the photographer brought an assistant, it might be appropriate or appreciated to tip the assistant, but not the owner.", "NTA AT ALL! The nerve of this woman is unbelievable! So unprofessional and RUDE! She doesn't make an effort to have a client, then she shouldn't be in the business", "NTA \n\nThis photographer is ridiculously unprofessional. There is no reason why you shouldn't have your pictures by now, and she absolutely had no business releasing ANY images to anyone else before you, regardless of their relationship.", "NTA. Having been a wedding photographer, what this person did was insanely unprofessional. I would have family contact me all the time asking for photos and copies of photos. My response every time was, please speak with the person who paid for them after they receive them. And I always worked within agreed upon timelines to deliver. EVERYTHING was discussed and on the table about timelines and expectations.", "Wedding photographer for 12 years. NTA. NO ONE should get access to the photos before the couple.", "NTA id just leave a review of how unprofessional she is. Don\u2019t expect to receive YOUR PICTURES or any replies from this women. Not worth the dolla dolla bill yall.", "NTA. While it takes a while to get all of your pictures, my photographer took months to get all of ours to us because of course she has other photography jobs and a life so she\u2019s not spending 8hrs straight on just my pictures or something, sending pictures to your sister before sending any to you was extremely unprofessional. My photographer even edited and sent me a small handful of pictures so that we could enjoy them freshly after the excitement of getting married and post some right after incase we wanted to. If she had time to edit and send one to your sister, she had time to edit and send a couple to you. She just didn\u2019t. She also asked if there were any specific pictures I wanted asap (like if I wanted one for a Christmas card for example), she didn\u2019t wait for me to ask.", "I'm wondering about the SIL? Who is she to decide what happens to YOUR photos? I bet if this had happened to her wedding, she would have raised holy hell!\n\nAnother self-entitled jerk!", "NTA. Leave reviews and explain how unprofessional she is everywhere you can.", "NTA. \n\nI would contact her to find out when your going to get your photos. \n\nThen look at the contract to see what her deadline is supposed to be and what should be happening if she doesn't reach that deadline, doesn't communicate nothing. \n\nThen I would talk to a lawyer, because I bet she'll stop working on your photos and push them off to the side now that you've confronted her, she might not give you the photos at all. \n\nSo definitely talk to a lawyer as you might not get any photos now, and she may come up with some excuse as to them being lost. \n\nBut let's home she just finishes and sends them to you. \n\nShe was extremely unprofessional and disrespectful to send photos you paid for to someone else. Regardless of whether or not it was a friend or your family member. Doesnt matter. \n\nI would never her a low review for her unprofessional behavior and her lack of communication, and her lack in keeping to her contract, and sharing photos without your permission. \n\nLesson learned, never use family friends for events. No matter how good they may be.", "NTA totally unprofessional for her to give photos of you to another person without your permission. Once you have the photos  you will need to review her online and warn people.", "NTA she\u2019s being unprofessional, get your pictures and then post a true review. Did you pay her in full?", "I think what annoys me most is that she gave away something that, for my wedding, was a keepsake we would thoughtfully send our extended family after the event.  We would send a two photo set:  a photo of the extended family with bride and groom and a photo just of that nuclear family together in a frame.\n\nSo she not only would have given away something I paid for, but given away something I paid for that was part of a planned keepsake!\n\nIt\u2019s incredibly problematic.", "Agreed. Once you get the images, be sure to leave reviews wherever you can. She broke the cardinal rule of \"don't post pics before the couple posts pics\" and she's the damn photographer! NTA", "For an October wedding I\u2019d think turnaround time would be longer due to it being busy season.  I quote 12 weeks but it doesn\u2019t usually take that long and I provide a teaser album of 40 images or so within a week", "Yeah and sending picture to sis? I framed cute family pictures from my wedding and gave them as gifts. I paid for the pictures (as did OP).\nPhotographer owes her a refund on time that she was doing a photoshoot with sis.", "Honestly OP, I applaud you for saying something to her, good for you! I think NTA and the photographer was really unprofessional."]}
