We don't typically eat out because I have severe food allergies (shellfish, tree nuts, and peanuts) but we do have a short list that I'm comfortable. As I was driving down our street, I looked over and saw an open snack package on the passenger floor. Husband and I both keep our cars neat so it jumped out at me.  I knew that 2 weeks ago we returned from celebrating our 10 year anniversary; I assumed we just missed some  trash.\n\nI got to a stoplight, I reached over and grabbed it.  I saw that it was a bag of Almond Granola. I'm highly allergic (ie: I have to carry 2 epi-pens) to nuts. Our home and shared spaces are nut free. When my husband and I dated, I shared about my allergies and he more than willingly gave up nuts to ensure my safety. Seeing this in our vehicle was surprising and anxiety inducing.\n\n I had no idea if there was nut residue on the steering wheel or in my seat and I was truly worried that I was going to have a reaction. Upon arriving at home, I entered it stoically and immediately washed my hands and remained quiet; from both the anxiety of the what if and being hurt hurt that my husband had something that was lethal to me in his car.\n\nHe saw that something was wrong and probed me for a bit. I finally asked him if he had something in his car that might not be good for me. He had no idea what I was referring to, so I told him. Immediately he put up a wall. Said that his mother (who he visited a week ago and knows about my allergies) gave him the snacks as he was leaving.  He had \"no idea\" there were nuts in them. My husband is an engineer.  Educated.  I struggled to understand how he wouldn't realize something called \"almond granola\" had nuts.\n\nHe doubled down and told me that it wasn't his fault and he had nothing to feel bad about. He didn't purchase it.  He didn't ask for it. It was just in his car. After all, he didn't bring it into the house. For 10 years he hasn't brought nuts into our home nor ate them. I told him that I held him to a higher standard and said that I had to be hyper vigilant to ensure I didn't touch or eat something that would make me very sick or worse and had always assumed he did the same thing. He shot back that again, this wasn't his fault. His mom gave it to him. He didn't know it was nuts. And it wasn't in the house so I shouldn't be upset.\n\nI told him, after this went on, that I felt like I couldn't trust him and we were back to square one when it came to my allergies because I wondered what else he didn't pick up on and what he wouldn't notice in the future. He told me I was over reacting, that he wasn't at fault as this was no harm and no foul and I didn't even have a reaction.\n\nIt felt so out of character for him, so it truly makes me wonder if I'm being the asshole here by telling him I can't trust him anymore.", "created_utc": 1682306074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12x132b/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_cannot_trust_him/", "score": 182, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Nothing you've said indicates that he has a pattern of disregarding this issue, so you're basically saying that he's lying when he says he didn't know. If he is, in fact, lying, then it would change my opinion, but on the face of it, you would be the one actively damaging your relationship by holding his feet to the fire over this.", "Ask his mom if she gave it to him. If she didn't, then someone is lying and you've got more than one huge issue to address here.\nNTA.", "If you're allergic to the point where residue on the steering wheel could make you need to EpiPen yourself, then he NEEDS to be a part of that. The fact that he has been doing it for 10 years proves that this wasn't ignorance, it was apathy. He didn't want to tell his mom no, then he forgot about them, and needed an excuse to not be the one to blame. 100% NTA here. There needs to be a nonconfrontational conversation about this and about what happens going forward. If he wants that kind of thing in his car, then it needs to be understood and agreed upon, since it will mean that you cannot be in his car anymore.", "YTA. If this is what it takes to break your trust after 10 years, you don't have enough trust in your relationship.", "ESH? NAH? \n\nAlmonds I believe are classified as seeds, most people with nut allergies have no reaction at all to them. It's not unreasonable to me he'd glance at a pack of gifted mixed snack, not see \"nuts\" and just keep them for emergency car snacks. The way you've written this post is like you're accusing him of trying to murder you.\n\nHe was however weirdly defensive and could've just said \"sorry babe, I didn't think it was on the bad list, I'll go clean the car\". Especially since you say you're allergic to tree nuts as well as regular, it seems like something he'd be cautious of. \n\nIdk, it reads to me like you came in accusing him of gross misconduct and he immediately put up a defensive wall instead of having a polite conversation.", "NTA.  \n\n\nLet's say it's true that his mom gave it to him. Whatever. But if that was the case he still could have 1) Said \"no thank you.\" 2) Taken it to be polite, then toss it in the garbage, or 3) at the very least, NOT OPEN IT IN THE CAR.   \n\n\nThe fact that he opened it in a space he knows you share is the biggest problem for me. And the fact that he's obviously lying about not knowing it had nuts?! Good luck OP!", "if he had immediately gone \u201coh fuck, I fucked up, I\u2019m sorry\u201d then he could argue that it\u2019s one mistake in 10 years.\n\nBut he got defensive. He said that his mistake happened because he\u2019s too stupid to realise it had nuts in or check for nuts. And he\u2019s too spineless to tell his mum to not give him things with nuts. Unless he grows a brain overnight, how is he going to stop it from happening again? If he doesn\u2019t take some responsibility for it, then there\u2019s absolutely nothing he is doing to stop it happening again. If he\u2019s too stupid to be hypervigilant about nuts, then of course you can\u2019t trust him to be hypervigilant about nuts.\n\nAlso if it\u2019s fine because it wasn\u2019t in the house, either he knew there was nuts so left it in the car on purpose, or it was a complete coincidence it got left in the car so his defence that it wasn\u2019t in the house is bullshit.", "!updateme", "YTA - and frankly you're a bit of a bully", "YTASounds like extreme gaslighting to me. You need to apologize.  \nIt also sounds like you do similar things to him often, which is probably why he (possibly) made up the story about his mom. He felt caught and cornered, at least from how you tell the story.", "YTA stop being so hysterical", "YTA. You have an allergy. You said yourself that it is rare for your husband to bring nuts into the house. Why are you berating him for making a single mistake? Sure, he could apologise for not remembering he out nuts in the car a week ago. But people tend to lose empathy when none is afforded to them. He made a mistake. There was no malice.", "YTA", "YTA. Also you walked into the house and stayed quiet and then when he mentioned it you responded with a shitty remark, kind of like a\nChild.", "YTA. You came off and attacked him after making him ask what was wrong. What you SHOULD have done was be an adult, come in and wash your hands, and then ask him (you know, the whole communication thing that as an adult you should be capable of) \"I saw this in the car, you know my allergy, can you please explain?\".\n\nNo. Instead, you waited for him to ask what was wrong (making him pry for information) and then blew up on him. If this is what it takes to break the trust of someone you've been married to for 10 years, then do HIM a favor and leave because you never trusted him in the first place.", "NTA - what if you\u2019d had a reaction while driving? You could have had no warning, been speeding down the highway, and contagion from the steering wheel or seats could have hit you. \n\nThis is a very dangerous situation, and the people blowing it off have no idea how quickly allergies can become life-threatening.

He screws up one time in over 10 years of being together and you are pretty much acting like he tried to murder you.  Give him the benefit of the doubt.  Otherwise it is just you being unreasonable and impossible to please.  If 10 years of being vigilant means nothing to you, you need to reevaluate.", "YTA \n\nYou may be on the brink of a dangerous anaphylactic shock and when he asks you if everything is ok you play the passive agressive game of guess what's wrong?\n\nYou drive all the way to your home with an open package of death, then grab it to throw it in the garbage?\n\nI think in this situation, littering, while still wrong would've been mandatory.\n\nNo offense but kinda seems like you wanted drama instead.", "Why did everyone right away accuse him of having an affair?? He probably bought it for himself but forgot to throw it away so he tried to put the blame on his mom which is a bit of AH. Yes, he should be cautious since his wife is allergic to nuts but at the same time i understand if he craves n wants to eat food that has nuts too consider that he has been accommodating w op diet for more than 10 years...", "Nta - if he TRULY didn't know it had nits, that would be terrifying. I completely get why now you are afraid of what else he might have missed. \n\nIts like either he is lying to you or he has no idea how to protect you. Both are bad. Sheesh", "Yta.  You are making a lot out of this.  It isn\u2019t a trust violation.  It\u2019s a mistake.", "If he ate it/ was around it 1 week ago, came home (probably touched you) and you didn't have any reaction - what is the issue?\n\nYou were driving with it in the car and had no reaction too - what's the issue?\n\nWhy are you creating an issue unnecessarily?\n\nYTA", "Yeah, YTA. I can tell just by the way you related the story and especially you telling him that because of this one incident in over a decade of being together, you can't trust him anymore (your words).\n\nYou had an epipen at hand, so even if you began to have a reaction to the almond granola and immediately used the epinephrine, it wouldn't be lethal and at worst you and your hubby would spend some quality time together at the ER. Instead, you got home and chewed him a new one, when you could've used a bit of tact and humor and given him some credit for only nearly killing you once in ten years of marriage.\n\nedited to remove second judgmental statement", "YTA for the way you handled this. I also have a tree nut allergy and while we\u2019ve only been with my wife for 5 years, I\u2019ve always spoken to her in her rare slips", "Almonds are not nuts. As someone with a nut allergy (among others) you should know that. Either this story nonsense or you don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re actually allergic to and neither option makes you look good.

The wife is also driving husband's car, not the other way around. YTA", "He probably eats things with nuts in his car frequently and forgot to throw it out this time. It's hard for people to follow a diet that doesn't pertain to them.", "ESH. You for the overreaction. You could have calmly asked him instead of backing him into a corner. In your post, you also belittle him. \n\nIt could have been an honest mistake. But him denying his mistake in ANY part was an AH move.", "He made his first mistake in 10 years. He probably eats nuts away from you but washes hands, brushes teeth etc and you\u2019ve never one had a reaction. He always keeps it out of the house and follows all the rules. \n\nWas he maybe getting defensive because you went in guns blazing?  For a first infraction you could have sat him down talked it out instead. \n\nThere was another post a while back where the OP\u2019s also had a severe nut allergy.

This is very concerning, and your reaction is valid.", "NTA your emotions are understandable but since this seems to be the first out of character behaviour then give him another chance to have your trust but if he wants to keep brushing it off just because you didn't get a reaction that time, that's something to worry about because this is your health, if you died his answer would be \" I didn't know there was nuts \"you are his wife why is there no consideration? Yes it's your allergy but you announced it 10 years ago and he does need to help make sure he doesn't bring back nut residue\n\n\nIt's complete BS for people to decide how something effects someone, \"I don't see it as a big deal so it isn't one\" screw you that choice isn't up to you, it's her health she sees nuts in the car which she grabbed not knowing what it was she could have been going to the hospital instead WHY RISK IT??", "NTA\n\nI would ask his mom if she gave it to him.  \n\nIf she did, I would remind her of your allergies.\n\nIf not, I would be investigating.", "Oh baby booboo \nGrow TF up baby\nAccidents happen", "NTA.

Not lose it and put up a wall like he did.", "NTA. If I've been with someone for 10 years, I would know and make sure which food have nuts or whatever.

He didnt bring it inside. He's obviously taken care to make sure you dont react and has been vigilant. Aside from not knowing almond granola had nuts, which thats the only thing i agree with, that i dont by. This is such a non issue!

Wash your hands and simply ask him? \"hey i saw a packet of almond granola in your car. could he let you know before you use his car just so you can be aware and careful\" \n\nESH. You both need communication and this is such a non issue to react about.", "Yeah my immediate thought was someone was riding over there and eating and left there trash.\n\nHad husband eaten it or even looked at it he would be aware there was almonds.", "Or, he really likes nuts and keeps some as a snack in his car to indulge when he is not around her. He must be washing his hands and brushing his teeth since she hasn't had a reaction. She has an allergy, and they both have to live under her restrictions. She isn't a child, and neither is he. In ten years, they have managed it, and she hasn't had a reaction. It doesn't seem it is something he can talk to her about because look how she reacted here to an empty bag of almond trail mix. Or closed, I'm not sure, but she was concerned about traces of it. Having an allergy sucks, but she seems beyond restrictive.\n\nIf he was cheating and kept his car so neat, don't you think he would have noticed that and got rid of the evidence?", "OP also says that they both keep their cars neat, and that it was out of the ordinary to the point it jumped out at her.", "Especially if you eat a granola nut bar, you have this stuff in your teeth for hours. A kiss and she would have known since her allergy is so bad.", "Yep. This was overly defensive and an out-of-pattern behaviour for something he claims to have taken quite seriously for a decade. My spidey sense be tingling. I wonder what his mother would say if OP asked her about it?  NTA", "I think it\u2019s less that there were nuts and more that his reaction wasn\u2019t \u201comg I\u2019m so sorry my mom gave that to me and I forgot it was in the car\u201d and more \u201chow dare you accuse me of not caring\u201d. When the first reaction is defensive and not realizing anything could have possibly gone wrong, it raises flags. Especially when it\u2019s a literal life or death situation", "You really want to argue that it was totally okay for him to just casually leave a bag of something that could kill his wife in a car she used? A bag of something that could cause a deadly reaction while she was operating that said 1 ton box of steel on the open road with other cars around her? Seriously?\n\nHis defence that he had no idea there were nuts in almond snacks is illogical. He clearly saw and knew they were not safe to take into his house. So he very much had some idea.", "How could he not know almond was a nut?!", "It's bizarre that the top answers are Y T A, like she should brush it off, shit happens. You realise it could have killed or hospitalised her? \n\nLike the husband wouldn't need to apologise for his mom leaving a hand grenade in the car because in the ten years before that he's never left a hand grenade in the car. NTA", "If she just hated the smell, I would agree with you.\n\n\n\nIf my spouse was *deathly* allergic to something and I had partial responsibility for that thing being around them, the first thing I would do is apologize. If it was caused by my mother, I would still apologize, and do you want to know why?\n\n\n\nYou can't fix death. Allergies don't care if the exposure is intentional or accidental, they will still kill someone. I would feel like a failure as a spouse if I risked my partner's life over a damn snack like that.", "My concern is what if the mother never gave it to him at all, what if he's been eating her allergens this whole time but this is the first time he forgot to hide the evidence and got caught and mom was just the convenient scapegoat? According to OP he made a point to specify he never even brought it in the house (which makes me think he knew exactly what was in there) and knowing your wife is severely allergic and you don't even check the ingredients before going home and kissing her? After 10 years I'd think it would be almost second nature to, ya know, not kill your wife\n\nOh yeah, definitely NTA", "I mean it sucks either way. Either a) he's a liar. Or b) after 10 years he doesn't know how to check things for nuts. Both are bad.", "Her allergy could kill her, and she's the bad guy for feeling like he broke her trust? Really?", "Yeah because nobody ever fucks up once they\u2019ve been married 10 years /s", "He got defensive because she waited like a child for him to ask what was wrong and then attacked him.", "that's what bugged me too. Like if it's that important then you don't play mind games asking him about the wrapper as if you didn't already know. That's incredibly childish. YTA, OP", "Tell me you don\u2019t know how anaphylaxis works without telling me you don\u2019t know how anaphylaxis works. Jfc", "Absolutely this. Husband is batting .999 and one strike means start the game over with trust levels with OP.", "I would lose trust in his ability to keep me safe too if I was her. If he truly didn't know almonds could hurt her, and left potential nut residue in a space she could enter... thats just terrifying to think about how many other times he might have put her at risk.", "You\u2019re missing the big picture, Old Fox. The husband is having an affair.", "It\u2019s an *affair!*", "That has lasted 10 years because husband has batted .999 on keeping wife safe. Yep relationship over one mistake; what you smoking?", "Bruh it\u2019s one time in 10 years, you are fucking insane if you think that qualifies losing complete trust in your partner of 10 years, like Jesus get a grip on reality", "Lighten up? She\u2019s severely allergic to nuts, it could kill her", "If you live with someone woth this allergy for 10 year, you would know.", "After that many years with such an extreme allergy he should know exactly what to look out for", "> you were allergic to tree nuts and peanuts\n\nWhere do you think an almond comes from?", "Holy shit, that\u2019s a leap", "I was thinking that too\u2026.he sounds crazy defensive and over-explanatory.  Also, didn\u2019t know almond was a nut?!", "So he just must be cheating? People like you assuming the worst is what ruins relationships when somebody comes to Reddit for advice. You must be terribly unhappy in life.", "He\u2019s Defensive because she didn\u2019t bring it up\nTo him and he had to get it out of her. If she\u2019d just asked they could\u2019ve had a discussion", "The red flag is OP being deathly allergic to nuts, but it was fine driving in the car with them and touching the packet. I think OP could be overreacting, and the husband is tired of taking the blame for her non-issue.", "It\u2019s not.", "I feel like people often don't realise how serious allergies can be. It's not a matter of just administering an epi pen, and she'll be right. It's a hospital trip and potential death if you can't get to the hospital on time. An epi pen doesn't get you out of trouble, necessarily. And you can never know how you're going to react. One episode you may have a mild skin reaction, yet during another you may get full on anaphalaxis. For me, it's the way OP's husband reacted. Rather than owning up to his mistake, he's taking no responsibility at all. That makes it harder for OP to trust him.", "If he ate allergens for the past 10 years and she never found out it means he is EXTREMELY careful. Because...10 years?? No mistake? Why would he suddenly leave a package lying around so easy to spot? And why would his mother do that? She knows about the allergies. Maybe if she is some very evil person but OP didn't mention that. The whole story is weird. NTA for sure because OP can literally die, but something is not right.", "Oh yeah, there's definitely a deeper issue of some kind here.", "If that\u2019s the case, then isn\u2019t it highly likely that her allergies aren\u2019t as bad as she originally thought?", "Or he just missed one for some reason. understandable if he's routine for a decade has been checking them before buying, missing checking if he didn't buy it isn't that wild. No info on what was going on when he was given the bar or whatever. People make mistakes. Assuming lying, intent or inability due to one slip in a decade seems a bit harsh. Especially if his mom knows and usually checks so he may have assumed it's okay, or the likely scenario that for whatever reason and one moment he wasn't thinking about it and made a mistake.", "Is there a c) here? That her allergies aren\u2019t as bad as she originally thought?", "Would you say the same if he'd left a rattlesnake in the car, or would you give her some slack for not behaving entirely calmly and rationally?", "I have anaphylaxis. My parent borrowed my car without telling me and had eaten nuts without washing their hands. I was focussed on traffic as I pulled out. My hands started burning within a block and 3 mins later anaphylaxis kicked in but I\u2019d gotten back home. Some people it takes a little while, especially if you\u2019re focussed on driving for it to kick in that it\u2019s real and not your imagination. Allergies and even anaphylaxis don\u2019t present identically in everyone or the same each time in the same person.", "But she did enter the space and didn\u2019t have a reaction, meaning he contained the allergen. He either didn\u2019t eat it in the car, or he did and cleaned himself and the car surfaces afterwards, but either way she didn\u2019t get sick.", "One time in ten years.  And now she\u2019s acting like he did it on purpose and is her enemy.  That is what is unfair here.  If she thinks he wants her dead, she should leave him.", "Absolutely not. Look at OP\u2019s reaction, totally over the top, start over on trust. Husband has been getting this lecture for years in terms of emotional abuse. Messes up one time and freezes because emotional abuse incoming.", "Damn please don't start assuming shi without any proof :/", "With nuts?", "True true. Not everyone thinks, though. My inlaws hot me special nut free chocolate for Easter but got my hubby a choc hazelnut squirrel. I just need to be in the room/car with nuts and I have a reaction", "Almonds are not nuts though.", "Peanuts aren\u2019t tree nuts or nuts at all. Some people really don\u2019t know.", "Yep. But it\u2019s true, I bet a schmillion $$. Ask OP what she thinks.", "Actually, almonds aren\u2019t nuts.\n\nhttps://www.fs.usda.gov/wildflowers/ethnobotany/food/nuts.shtml", "[removed]", "Just erased my comment as it was based on an incorrect reading of the post.", "They are classed as one for people with tree nut allergies though. Regardless of pedantry, they are sold as nuts, so it\u2019s hard to understand how someone wouldn\u2019t realise they are a problem.", "Not sure how OP\u2019s allergies work, but a lot of people who are allergic to nuts can eat almonds bc they are seeds. That\u2019s true for me. But a lot of things that have almonds in them still set off a reaction for me. Maybe it\u2019s traces of nuts from the factory?", "But then why not say \u201coh my god, I\u2019m so sorry\u201d in that case?", "I\u2019m sorry, it said almond on the package. How does one not understand almond is a nut? \n\nHe obviously read it and knew not to bring it to the house. So he definitely knew it was dangerous to her. Yet he left it in a car she used.", "yeah I'd say the same thing. He even had to \"Probe her a bit\" before she even brought it up. I might have cut her some slack if she stormed in shouting out of emotion or whatever but if she can think clearly enough to play mind games she can think clearly enough to just talk like an adult.", "\"I only poisoned you once in ten years. It's not a big deal.\"", "Not for botanical purposes, but it is considered a tree nut for allergy purposes. Confusing AF, but from everything I've read it's true.", "OK? She said she's allergic to tree nuts. And I'm sure that after 10 years of marriage, almonds have come up, if not specifically, then in the conversations where she said that nuts of any kind can kill her.", "Wow so i googled and found this too \"almonds are considered to be seeds rather than nuts\". Im guessing that's why OP doesn't have/show any reaction after contacting with almond??", "Rule 1: Be civil", "No, you were just \"asking questions.\" Tucker Carlson says hi.", "If it was sealed, then I find her reaction even more bizarre. That would mean hubby got the nuts, thought about his wife's allergies and decided not to even open them, forgot them in the car, wife found them and loses her shit over NOT coming in contact with nuts? Okay.", "Right, but he also ate them a week prior. So, maybe he waddling he didn't know they were nuts, more like he didn't know there were nuts in the car.", "He got defensive. And while he handled it poorly, her approach wasn't the best either. She asked, he didn't remember, and then got defensive since wife was accusing instead of communicating. The likeliness of him feeling like shit and trying to defend himself not just from her but the guilt he feels is understandable in the situation, even if that doesn't make it right. A very human thing to make a mistake even after a decade of not making such a mistake. These things happen. Even the best surgeons sometimes make mistakes in routine operations. And often find it hard to accept they made a stupid mistake and initial reaction is to shift blame. Why does reddit always seem to believe there's something much larger going on and not human error. A lot of people speculating on cheating and such as being more likely than human error.\n\nHer loosing trust over one mistake is a much larger problem here.", "Also, when someone you love has a nut allergy, you assume all granola has nuts. That\u2019s basic for nut allergies.", "How is it obvious he read it? And to be honest is that even relevant. He could have easily eaten it without reading. He ate it in the car and forgot to clean up. This is the most likely scenario. Who knows why he forgot or made a mistake and does it matter. If it's the first mistake in a decade. I doubt he'll make the same mistake again. Heck I've forgotten to beware my own allergies in a year more than he has his wife's in a decade. \n\nDo you never make mistakes? Not do something you fully intended to do? Something never slipped your mind?", "Technically almond is not a nut.", "Well, I think I can happily ignore your opinion then. Maybe you would act like that, maybe I would too but we don't really know until it happens. People react to shock and stress differently, freezing up is pretty common and she doesn't sound like a shouter. Calling her childish is, like I say, bizarre when you're letting him refuse to apologise for literally risking her life just because she didn't behave the right way immediately after.", "Did he poison her though? Is she writing this post from the hospital?", "People with \"tree nut allergy\" are also allergic to almonds sadly.", "It could also explain the husband\u2019s defense that he didn\u2019t know that the snack contained nuts. Engineers are known for being literal in word usage.", "Apologies. I will do better.", "I have no idea what that means. I do know asking questions is part of that whole \u201ccommunicating\u201d thing that goes with \u201clistening.\u201d  I\u2019m super excited to see what trite bit of nonsense you come back with. C\u2019mon. Dazzle us\ud83e\udd29. It\u2019s fun!", "Yeah. But why were they still in the car? He either forgot to bring the groceries inside - which would have brought nuts into the house. Or he forgot to throw out the nuts - which is still a risk to OP. \nI\u2019m not saying I\u2019d go as far as not trusting him, but if I were OP, I\u2019d like an acknowledgment that oops, this was a stuff up, and how to prevent it happening again. It feels like as soon as hubby knew he\u2019d screwed up he got defensive and wanted to be right more than he cared about the possible consequences to OP. And that\u2019s a problem. His Mum is also a problem, giving nuts to hubby. I get the impression OP is allergic enough that if OP had eaten it and then gone and kissed OP it would be hospital. They have both known about the allergy for a decade, that\u2019s long enough to be annoyed with people being careless with something that endangers you.", "We also assume it\u2019s produced in a facility that cross contaminates with other kinds of nuts. So I\u2019m very inclined to say if my spouse had a serious allergy I\u2019d be very alert to not having any trace of it.", "A peanut is also technically a legume. But if OP says she\u2019s allergic, and carry 2 epi pens, I\u2019m going to assume she knows she\u2019s allergic to almonds.", "Okay, i just thought that maybe OP is allergic to tree nuts but not all of them (eg: almond) bc she didn't show any reaction after possibly contacting w it. Cuz usually nut has lot of small residue so i assume if the husband forgot to throw the packet then he may also forget to clean the steering and seats?? \n\nBtw I do think allergies should be taken seriously!! I only comment cuz i didn't know almonds aren't truly nuts but still considered as tree nuts?? \ud83d\ude05", "Nope, not wasting time on an unlovable troll. \u2764\ufe0f", "Maybe hubby got defensive because he hasn't made this mistake in the last 10 years. He has been careful and considerate to OP's needs without fail for a decade. And now the one time he messes up, she no longer trusts him? \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf I tell person 'yes' a million times, but the one time I say 'no', they become hostile, that would be the last time I ever do anything for them. Her allergies are her problem. She is not entitled to other people accommodating her. Her has volunteered to do so. He's done a great job so far, so maybe OP could've been less accusatory and more delicate about the f*ck up. When a person isn't afforded empathy, they tend not to show it. So I can understand why her husband didn't apologise. She didn't really give him a chance before going straight to interrogation and saying hurtful things. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, his mom probably gave him the snake because she knows he likes them and hasn't been able to freely eat them at home for the last 10 years? Again, if OP was deathly allergic, she would've had a reaction a week ago when he came home with almond breath. I think this is a lot of anxiety and not really an allergy. I have known people with severe allergies and administer epi's. After a week of being around the nut residue, she should've already had a reaction. I think that's also why hubby isn't falling over himself to apologise. Maybe he knows that there was no real risk of losing his wife.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing with that. Just responding to:\n\n> How does one not understand almond is a nut?", "Yes for all allergy related purposes they\u2019re classed as a nut. Peanuts aren\u2019t nuts but are classed as nut allergies too.", "As I said, I\u2019m not disagreeing with that. Just stating a fact."]}
