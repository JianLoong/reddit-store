We don't typically eat out because I have severe food allergies (shellfish, tree nuts, and peanuts) but we do have a short list that I'm comfortable. As I was driving down our street, I looked over and saw an open snack package on the passenger floor. Husband and I both keep our cars neat so it jumped out at me.  I knew that 2 weeks ago we returned from celebrating our 10 year anniversary; I assumed we just missed some  trash.\n\nI got to a stoplight, I reached over and grabbed it.  I saw that it was a bag of Almond Granola. I'm highly allergic (ie: I have to carry 2 epi-pens) to nuts. Our home and shared spaces are nut free. When my husband and I dated, I shared about my allergies and he more than willingly gave up nuts to ensure my safety. Seeing this in our vehicle was surprising and anxiety inducing.\n\n I had no idea if there was nut residue on the steering wheel or in my seat and I was truly worried that I was going to have a reaction. Upon arriving at home, I entered it stoically and immediately washed my hands and remained quiet; from both the anxiety of the what if and being hurt hurt that my husband had something that was lethal to me in his car.\n\nHe saw that something was wrong and probed me for a bit. I finally asked him if he had something in his car that might not be good for me. He had no idea what I was referring to, so I told him. Immediately he put up a wall. Said that his mother (who he visited a week ago and knows about my allergies) gave him the snacks as he was leaving.  He had \"no idea\" there were nuts in them. My husband is an engineer.  Educated.  I struggled to understand how he wouldn't realize something called \"almond granola\" had nuts.\n\nHe doubled down and told me that it wasn't his fault and he had nothing to feel bad about. He didn't purchase it.  He didn't ask for it. It was just in his car. After all, he didn't bring it into the house. For 10 years he hasn't brought nuts into our home nor ate them. I told him that I held him to a higher standard and said that I had to be hyper vigilant to ensure I didn't touch or eat something that would make me very sick or worse and had always assumed he did the same thing. He shot back that again, this wasn't his fault. His mom gave it to him. He didn't know it was nuts. And it wasn't in the house so I shouldn't be upset.\n\nI told him, after this went on, that I felt like I couldn't trust him and we were back to square one when it came to my allergies because I wondered what else he didn't pick up on and what he wouldn't notice in the future. He told me I was over reacting, that he wasn't at fault as this was no harm and no foul and I didn't even have a reaction.\n\nIt felt so out of character for him, so it truly makes me wonder if I'm being the asshole here by telling him I can't trust him anymore.", "created_utc": 1682306074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12x132b/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_cannot_trust_him/", "score": 1160, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe it came from another passenger that doesn't have any clue about you or your nut allergy?\n\nEdit: The first time I read this, I read it as being the leftover, empty bag from already consumed granola. After re-reading it was a full bag, I think OP still has a right to be upset & scared for what appears, to her, to be her husband's sudden carelessness & lack of regard for her life-threatening allergy. It boggles my mind he would accept it from his mom in the first place.", "Info: do you believe what he said - that his mom gave him some snacks and he scarfed it down while driving and didn\u2019t notice what it was?", "YTA. Nothing you've said indicates that he has a pattern of disregarding this issue, so you're basically saying that he's lying when he says he didn't know. If he is, in fact, lying, then it would change my opinion, but on the face of it, you would be the one actively damaging your relationship by holding his feet to the fire over this.", "Ask his mom if she gave it to him. If she didn't, then someone is lying and you've got more than one huge issue to address here.\nNTA.", "If you're allergic to the point where residue on the steering wheel could make you need to EpiPen yourself, then he NEEDS to be a part of that. The fact that he has been doing it for 10 years proves that this wasn't ignorance, it was apathy. He didn't want to tell his mom no, then he forgot about them, and needed an excuse to not be the one to blame. 100% NTA here. There needs to be a nonconfrontational conversation about this and about what happens going forward. If he wants that kind of thing in his car, then it needs to be understood and agreed upon, since it will mean that you cannot be in his car anymore.", "YTA. If this is what it takes to break your trust after 10 years, you don't have enough trust in your relationship.", "ESH? NAH? \n\nAlmonds I believe are classified as seeds, most people with nut allergies have no reaction at all to them. It's not unreasonable to me he'd glance at a pack of gifted mixed snack, not see \"nuts\" and just keep them for emergency car snacks. The way you've written this post is like you're accusing him of trying to murder you.\n\nHe was however weirdly defensive and could've just said \"sorry babe, I didn't think it was on the bad list, I'll go clean the car\". Especially since you say you're allergic to tree nuts as well as regular, it seems like something he'd be cautious of. \n\nIdk, it reads to me like you came in accusing him of gross misconduct and he immediately put up a defensive wall instead of having a polite conversation.", "NTA.  \n\n\nLet's say it's true that his mom gave it to him. Whatever. But if that was the case he still could have 1) Said \"no thank you.\" 2) Taken it to be polite, then toss it in the garbage, or 3) at the very least, NOT OPEN IT IN THE CAR.   \n\n\nThe fact that he opened it in a space he knows you share is the biggest problem for me. And the fact that he's obviously lying about not knowing it had nuts?! Good luck OP!", "if he had immediately gone \u201coh fuck, I fucked up, I\u2019m sorry\u201d then he could argue that it\u2019s one mistake in 10 years.\n\nBut he got defensive. He said that his mistake happened because he\u2019s too stupid to realise it had nuts in or check for nuts. And he\u2019s too spineless to tell his mum to not give him things with nuts. Unless he grows a brain overnight, how is he going to stop it from happening again? If he doesn\u2019t take some responsibility for it, then there\u2019s absolutely nothing he is doing to stop it happening again. If he\u2019s too stupid to be hypervigilant about nuts, then of course you can\u2019t trust him to be hypervigilant about nuts.\n\nAlso if it\u2019s fine because it wasn\u2019t in the house, either he knew there was nuts so left it in the car on purpose, or it was a complete coincidence it got left in the car so his defence that it wasn\u2019t in the house is bullshit.", "!updateme", "YTA - and frankly you're a bit of a bully", "YTASounds like extreme gaslighting to me. You need to apologize.  \nIt also sounds like you do similar things to him often, which is probably why he (possibly) made up the story about his mom. He felt caught and cornered, at least from how you tell the story.", "YTA stop being so hysterical", "YTA. You have an allergy. You said yourself that it is rare for your husband to bring nuts into the house. Why are you berating him for making a single mistake? Sure, he could apologise for not remembering he out nuts in the car a week ago. But people tend to lose empathy when none is afforded to them. He made a mistake. There was no malice.", "YTA", "YTA. Also you walked into the house and stayed quiet and then when he mentioned it you responded with a shitty remark, kind of like a\nChild.", "YTA. You came off and attacked him after making him ask what was wrong. What you SHOULD have done was be an adult, come in and wash your hands, and then ask him (you know, the whole communication thing that as an adult you should be capable of) \"I saw this in the car, you know my allergy, can you please explain?\".\n\nNo. Instead, you waited for him to ask what was wrong (making him pry for information) and then blew up on him. If this is what it takes to break the trust of someone you've been married to for 10 years, then do HIM a favor and leave because you never trusted him in the first place.", "NTA - what if you\u2019d had a reaction while driving? You could have had no warning, been speeding down the highway, and contagion from the steering wheel or seats could have hit you. \n\nThis is a very dangerous situation, and the people blowing it off have no idea how quickly allergies can become life-threatening. I wouldn\u2019t trust your husband if I were you, and would ask for couples therapy to try to save the relationship.", "Yta. \n\n1 mistake in 10 years.\n\nIt was his car, it's not like he left it in your car.", "YTA.  He screws up one time in over 10 years of being together and you are pretty much acting like he tried to murder you.  Give him the benefit of the doubt.  Otherwise it is just you being unreasonable and impossible to please.  If 10 years of being vigilant means nothing to you, you need to reevaluate.", "YTA \n\nYou may be on the brink of a dangerous anaphylactic shock and when he asks you if everything is ok you play the passive agressive game of guess what's wrong?\n\nYou drive all the way to your home with an open package of death, then grab it to throw it in the garbage?\n\nI think in this situation, littering, while still wrong would've been mandatory.\n\nNo offense but kinda seems like you wanted drama instead.", "Why did everyone right away accuse him of having an affair?? He probably bought it for himself but forgot to throw it away so he tried to put the blame on his mom which is a bit of AH. Yes, he should be cautious since his wife is allergic to nuts but at the same time i understand if he craves n wants to eat food that has nuts too consider that he has been accommodating w op diet for more than 10 years...", "Nta - if he TRULY didn't know it had nits, that would be terrifying. I completely get why now you are afraid of what else he might have missed. \n\nIts like either he is lying to you or he has no idea how to protect you. Both are bad. Sheesh", "Yta.  You are making a lot out of this.  It isn\u2019t a trust violation.  It\u2019s a mistake.", "If he ate it/ was around it 1 week ago, came home (probably touched you) and you didn't have any reaction - what is the issue?\n\nYou were driving with it in the car and had no reaction too - what's the issue?\n\nWhy are you creating an issue unnecessarily?\n\nYTA", "Yeah, YTA. I can tell just by the way you related the story and especially you telling him that because of this one incident in over a decade of being together, you can't trust him anymore (your words).\n\nYou had an epipen at hand, so even if you began to have a reaction to the almond granola and immediately used the epinephrine, it wouldn't be lethal and at worst you and your hubby would spend some quality time together at the ER. Instead, you got home and chewed him a new one, when you could've used a bit of tact and humor and given him some credit for only nearly killing you once in ten years of marriage.\n\nedited to remove second judgmental statement", "YTA for the way you handled this. I also have a tree nut allergy and while we\u2019ve only been with my wife for 5 years, I\u2019ve always spoken to her in her rare slips", "Almonds are not nuts. As someone with a nut allergy (among others) you should know that. Either this story nonsense or you don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re actually allergic to and neither option makes you look good.

I'm sorry, I see very little hope for this relationship.", "NTA \n\nWhat if he ate it right before he kissed you or you took a sip from his coffee mug? \n\nDoes he not check his foods for your allergens at all?\n\nHis carelessness and defensiveness makes him the AH. You have lost trust, and you are not the AH for being honest about that.", "Lmao all these people calling the husband the asshole don't even know that almond is not a nut. The wife is also driving husband's car, not the other way around. YTA", "He probably eats things with nuts in his car frequently and forgot to throw it out this time. It's hard for people to follow a diet that doesn't pertain to them.", "ESH. You for the overreaction. You could have calmly asked him instead of backing him into a corner. In your post, you also belittle him. \n\nIt could have been an honest mistake. But him denying his mistake in ANY part was an AH move.", "He made his first mistake in 10 years. He probably eats nuts away from you but washes hands, brushes teeth etc and you\u2019ve never one had a reaction. He always keeps it out of the house and follows all the rules. \n\nWas he maybe getting defensive because you went in guns blazing?  For a first infraction you could have sat him down talked it out instead. \n\nThere was another post a while back where the OP\u2019s also had a severe nut allergy.

Yes it's your allergy but you announced it 10 years ago and he does need to help make sure he doesn't bring back nut residue\n\n\nIt's complete BS for people to decide how something effects someone, \"I don't see it as a big deal so it isn't one\" screw you that choice isn't up to you, it's her health she sees nuts in the car which she grabbed not knowing what it was she could have been going to the hospital instead WHY RISK IT??", "NTA\n\nI would ask his mom if she gave it to him.  \n\nIf she did, I would remind her of your allergies.\n\nIf not, I would be investigating.", "Oh baby booboo \nGrow TF up baby\nAccidents happen", "NTA.

(i guess?)\n\nbut again it never came into the house! this is such a non issue. And maybe instead of giving him 'stoic' (whatever that means to this situation) how about communicating with him? Wash your hands and simply ask him? \"hey i saw a packet of almond granola in your car. could he let you know before you use his car just so you can be aware and careful\"\n\nESH.

In ten years, they have managed it, and she hasn't had a reaction. It doesn't seem it is something he can talk to her about because look how she reacted here to an empty bag of almond trail mix.

A bag of something that could cause a deadly reaction while she was operating that said 1 ton box of steel on the open road with other cars around her?

It's not a matter of just administering an epi pen, and she'll be right. It's a hospital trip and potential death if you can't get to the hospital on time. An epi pen doesn't get you out of trouble, necessarily. And you can never know how you're going to react. One episode you may have a mild skin reaction, yet during another you may get full on anaphalaxis. For me, it's the way OP's husband reacted. Rather than owning up to his mistake, he's taking no responsibility at all. That makes it harder for OP to trust him.", "If he ate allergens for the past 10 years and she never found out it means he is EXTREMELY careful. Because...10 years?? No mistake? Why would he suddenly leave a package lying around so easy to spot? And why would his mother do that? She knows about the allergies. Maybe if she is some very evil person but OP didn't mention that.

Im guessing that's why OP doesn't have/show any reaction after contacting with almond??\n\nEdit: So almond consider as tree nut but i found out that if you have tree nut allergies it doesn't mean you are allergic to all of them so maybe it's the same for OP??", "Rule 1: Be civil", "[removed]", "If it was sealed, then I find her reaction even more bizarre. That would mean hubby got the nuts, thought about his wife's allergies and decided not to even open them, forgot them in the car, wife found them and loses her shit over NOT coming in contact with nuts? Okay.", "Right, but he also ate them a week prior. So, maybe he waddling he didn't know they were nuts, more like he didn't know there were nuts in the car.", "He got defensive. And while he handled it poorly, her approach wasn't the best either. She asked, he didn't remember, and then got defensive since wife was accusing instead of communicating. The likeliness of him feeling like shit and trying to defend himself not just from her but the guilt he feels is understandable in the situation, even if that doesn't make it right. A very human thing to make a mistake even after a decade of not making such a mistake. These things happen. Even the best surgeons sometimes make mistakes in routine operations. And often find it hard to accept they made a stupid mistake and initial reaction is to shift blame. Why does reddit always seem to believe there's something much larger going on and not human error.

It feels like as soon as hubby knew he\u2019d screwed up he got defensive and wanted to be right more than he cared about the possible consequences to OP. And that\u2019s a problem. His Mum is also a problem, giving nuts to hubby. I get the impression OP is allergic enough that if OP had eaten it and then gone and kissed OP it would be hospital.

Cuz usually nut has a lot of small residue so i assume if the husband forgot to throw the packet then he may also forget to clean the steering and seats?? \n\nBtw I do think allergies should be taken seriously!!

Her allergies are her problem. She is not entitled to other people accommodating her. Her has volunteered to do so. He's done a great job so far, so maybe OP could've been less accusatory and more delicate about the f*ck up. When a person isn't afforded empathy, they tend not to show it. So I can understand why her husband didn't apologise. She didn't really give him a chance before going straight to interrogation and saying hurtful things. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, his mom probably gave him the snacks because she knows he likes them and hasn't been able to freely eat them at home for the last 10 years? Again, if OP was deathly allergic, she would've had a reaction a week ago when he came home with almond breath. I think this is a lot of anxiety and not really an allergy. I have known people with severe allergies and administer epi's. After a week of being around the nut residue, she should've already had a reaction. I think that's also why hubby isn't falling over himself to apologise. Maybe he knows that there was no real risk of losing his wife.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing with that.

He was driving his mom around (I guess). She was eating the almond granola (it was opened, right)? She was leaving, so she left it for him. He didn't eat it, didn't care to even pay attention to what it was, hence why he didn't notice it had nuts and most importantly why it was left **on the floor** of the car. Who leaves food they intend to eat on the floor?\n\nFast forward a week, you find the almond granola. You get (justifiably) very stressed. But the part where you're not justified is when you go home and, instead of handling it like an adult, you give in to your emotions. You came at him offensively, so naturally he's gonna be defensive. You didn't ask, you didn't seek information or clarity, you straight up jumped to assuming he was at fault. Assuming he knew, assuming he was intentionally negligent, uncaring and what not.\n\nSo ask yourself, do you really have a reason to think he was negligent and uncaring?

I'm not sure exactly where to do that, so I'll leave a comment here and hopefully it gets some visibility.\n\nFirst, thank you for your varied opinions.  Some of y'all are passionate about this and I truly took time to scroll through this morning and read your comments.  I can see that it's divisive and that's why I came here, because I wanted a gut check.  I'm going to address a few common things that were spoken here in bullet form and not offer excuses but rather try to give you more info that I couldn't fit within the character limit of the original post.\n\n1. My husband isn't having an affair.  He's very loyal to me and I'm loyal to him.  When it comes to our monogamy, that I'm 100% in trust of.  We openly communicate on that.  Thank you though for your concern.  But in this relationship, no, no one is having an affair.\n2. I know that almonds are a seed, but they are classified as a nut for allergy reasons and my allergist has told me to avoid any and all nuts and I've had varied reactions, over time, to different things.\n3. Allergies are weird, y'all.  (at least in my case) Sometimes you can touch something and have zero reaction.  Sometimes you break out into a rash.  Sometimes you accidently ingest something and wind up horrifically sick.  When I got tested for allergies, the first thing my allergist said after seeing my results is \"You're lucky to be alive. You're very very allergic\" I wish I was making this up but it's true and it was horrific bedside manner.  But it hit me hard just how serious things are.\n4. I have been gaslit in the past by others in my life over my allergies.  When I was first diagnosed, (this was long before I met my husband) someone I was extremely close to refused to believe I developed an allergy and used to hide nuts in my food to prove it was all in my head.  It wasn't.  And I got sick.  So I do have trust issues when it comes to allowing people in my life, in regards to my personal health.\n5. When I first started dating OP, I was very open about how allergic I am and how I knew it could be a deal breaker. I offered him an out.  Told him I wouldn't mind if he left, because I understood that it would require a lifestyle change, because of how allergies work.  He told me he didn't mind and truly didn't.  For 10 years there have been very few slip ups and usually when there were, we used the moments for education on both parts and talked it out in a really great manner.\n6. His mom really did give him the bag of nuts.  It was as he was leaving her house and she handed him the open bag of granola.  He took it and put it in the seat next to him.  I don't know how he could miss that it said Almond on it, as it was in huge bold letters called \"Almond Granola\".  Also for those in allergy households, manufactured granola is a huge flag because it so often contains various nuts or cross contamination.\n7. I came in quiet to the house because I was truly in shock and monitoring my body.  I was checking to make sure I was breathing okay and that my tightness in my chest was from anxiety and not from a reaction.  I was truly scared.  I was trying to make sure it was anxiety vs allergic reaction.\n8. I will admit that saying \"is there something in your car that would make me sick\" was passive aggressive and childish.  In the moment, I was mid panic and just trying not to yell.  I truly felt violated and that my life was on the line in that moment.   Allergies are terrifying.  One slip and I could be dead and I'm not ready to die just yet, reddit.\n9. What made me not trust him isn't the fact he left the nuts in there.  It was his response of defensiveness and doubling down that it wasn't his fault and he had NOTHING to be sorry for.  Even a simple, \"I'm sorry I didn't check the labels I bring into our shared spaces\" would have been enough in that moment.  We could have used it as an education for both of us and talked it out.  It was the uncharacteristic defensiveness that threw me.\n10. Husband and I are married, so there have been comments saying it's his car.  He drives that car to work and I take my own but on weekends and weeknights, we use each others cards interchangeably, because we've been together so long that everything we've purchased has been together.  So all of our vehicles we view as shared space.\n\nThank you all for your feedback and discussion.  Even the private messages to me, although the slurs could have been left out, lol.

Somehow that doesn\u2019t seem very believable though.", "It's been rough because when I was first diagnosed my mom didn't believe that I was really allergic (I was a hypochondriac as a kid) so she would rub peanuts into my food and hide nuts in things and I would have various reactions and it made me lose trust in so many people.  Husband has always been my safe place and last night brought up those old feelings.  Thank you, Dumbledore, I really appreciate the insight", "Yeah. \n\nMy husband is allergic to nuts (and a few other things), and I am paranoid about checking labels and I trust NOTHING.", "No reddit is perfect and everything is a red flag.", "How often do you make mistakes that could kill your spouse and a bunch of other people? \n\nHow often do you put something in your mouth and have no idea what it was? \n\nWas she not supposed to be upset about it? Should she have come in the house screaming rather than being quiet? Should she have shoved his nose into the wrapper like people used to do to puppies? \"Oh hey babe nbd lol but this thing I'm deathly allergic to was in your car hahaha\"??", "Yeah this gave me drama queen vibes. \n\nAfter stoically washing her hands, she gives hubby the silent treatment, he has the drag the reason out of her, which was accusing him of leaving something 'lethal in the car'. Him saying he doesn't remember and oh my Mom gave me those is him 'putting a wall up'.  And after 10 years of no slip ups at all, now she apparently can't trust him.\n\nHonestly OP you sound exhausting, maybe next time instead of the silent treatment, sulking and games try having an actual adult conversation with your husband", "Lol, that part killed me. \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "You don\u2019t just carry Epi pens for mild reactions. They give those to people who have anaphylactic reactions", "I had the opposite with one allergy. It was mild a couple of times and once if I didn't get to the hospital in less than 20 min I would have suffocated.  You can grow out of some but you also can react way worse - and die the next time.", "And after 10 years, she should be able to come in and say, hey I found this in the car.  Instead she waited until her husband asked what was wrong.", "But she was making a huge deal out of it. It was her reaction.  He asked what was wrong. So she asked him like a child fo you have something in the car, that might be bad for me She could of washed her hands and said hey I found this in the car.   Instead he was being attacked.", "What kind of cheese?", "His response makes me think this isn't a one-off thing. It's more about him putting up a wall than the accident. Her not bringing it up until he forced it out of her was wrong, too. They were both toxic about something that is physically toxic to her.", "I'm sure under normal circumstances the husband, like myself would double check that everything being served to my partner was free of nuts. But he barely even knew those snacks were in the car it seems, and didn't know there were nuts in them\n\nMy parents are getting on in years and they genuinely can't remember that my name is different than it was 10 years ago. Which hurts.. but it's also not born out of malice, just genuinely inability to remember some things. Even very important things\n\nI guess I just want to give the people involved a charitable view", "What's your more believable thesis?", "Ugh I\u2019m sorry. Thats horrible. And your overreaction makes sense. If I were you, I\u2019d just apologize and communicate all this to him to explain your reaction but say that ultimately you realize you messed up, if you agree that you did mess up!", "> So I\u2019m very inclined to say if my spouse had a serious allergy I\u2019d be very alert to not having any trace of it.\n\n\n\namazing, me too actually! basically anything that I don't actually have to do i just know i'd be perfect at & never make a mistake with.\n\nthings I do have to do and occasionally slip up? Well I should be excused. But the things in my head I decided I'd be perfect at? Well I am full of judgement!", "You sound as awful to be married to as the OP. The guessing-game carry-on is textbook belittlement, and if OP wants a healthy response, they need to learn healthy first-moving.\n\n\"Did you leave something in your car that I'm allergic to?\" is how people (**wrongly**) scold *toddlers*. Saying she can't trust her husband anymore is incredibly problematic communication. People who speak that way to their spouses do it all the time, and speak to others that way too, because it highlights how conflict resolution has been learned by OP.\n\nThe correct way to start that conversation is \"I'm upset because I got in the car and found open food that has nuts in it and it made me anxious that I was going to have a serious reaction\" and take it from there.\n\nThey don't need to review their allergen protocols, they need couple's counselling; and OP needs individual therapy as well to tease out why she learned to communicate the way she does.", "Professionals make easy mistakes they know to avoid in situations where it might cause death or injury. It happens, surprised that humans make errors?\n\nOf course she can be upset, it's understandable, but so is his defensiveness. He probably wouldn't have been so defensive if she had been like this happened instead of are you trying to kill me attitude. But I understand them both, they are human.\n\nHave you never seriously made a mistake? Most surgeons make a fatal mistake they shouldn't have in a decade. It happens. This time nobody was harmed and he ate a bar and made a mistake on either checking the bar or cleaning up.\n\nI eat something I don't know at least once a month. Often weekly. But that's of course different since I don't risk my life or anyone's. But I've made enough stupid mistakes on the go to not be on a high horse judging everyone for their mistakes. I've to the hospital a couple of times due to my mistakes that would have been easily avoidable, not food related. And I nearly died once from an easy operation due to human error. \n\nWhy is it so hard for you to believe a regular as human slipped and made a mistake and got defensive when put on the spot when hearing that they put their wife's life or well being at risk. It happens, obviously not a lot since he's been doing it for a decade. \n\nIf I was the wife I would not be loosing trust over one bloody mistake.", "I'm not judging either way, but my son has an epipen for his allergy to peanuts but has never had an anaphylactic reactions.

If you are deadly allergic to peanuts, there is no way she ate Reeses on the regular and not know she was that allergic to peanuts.", "Slightly allergic and \"I need to carry two epi pens\" allergic are two completely different ballparks.

I love mushrooms. I sometimes forget to tell him when I buy items containing mushrooms, but I have warned him in the past that I can be forgetful and often think I've mentioned something when I actually haven't.\n\nSo my husband, who is the one allergic, takes full responsibility and double checks everything I bring into the house to see if it contains his allergens, even when I do mention it.\n\nHe says it's not my responsibility to constantly be on the lookout, it's his. Though because we are partners, I try. When we first got together, I eliminated mushrooms all together, but he convinced me not to deny myself and to enjoy them for the two of us.", "You seem incredibly ignorant of severe allergies imo.", "What I find odd is that she then picked up the package.", "The fact that she didn't die implies that she would have needed to eat or being in close contact with the nut in order to have an allergic reaction, which she didn't have in the slightest. Yet she doesn't trust her husband anymore and accuses him of not caring.", "The car itself is deadly, we all take a small risk of dying every time we leave the house, especially when we drive. The fact that she didn't die does of course change this, because the risk was nowhere near as close to a BRUSH WITH DEATH as  you are making up here. It's not zero, and I don't want to pretend this should go without a discussion. But she wasn't on death's door here, thankfully, and pretending she was helps nobody.", "Because maybe she was feeling some emotions she needed to sort through? Scared, anxious, confused, betrayed, angry...", "Now we\u2019re getting to the important questions.\n\nIt was a garlic and herb creamy Brie that I topped with a fresh crumbled goat cheese. Yes I top my cheese with cheese, no I will not accept judgement on it.", "Except according to the OP it is literally a once in ten years thing. Now you\u2019re just making stuff up.", "that someone else left it. When you are around people with allergies for 10 years, you develop habits and mistakes are rare. If he ate it, then it\u2019s unlikely (not impossible) that he would just leave it in his car, especially when he\u2019d be used to disposing of such things and washing his hands. If others were in his car, it makes more sense that he might not account for them.\n\nEither way it doesn\u2019t matter. The better takeaway is we don\u2019t have enough people information to make any reasonable conclusion. We have the assumption of someone that was recently stressed out and acted passive aggressive, we have the husband who simply says that he didn\u2019t know and got \u2018defensive\u2019, and that this would be uncharacteristic behaviour for him. That\u2019s really it.", "I'm planning on it.  We'll have a good talk tonight and I hope we can come to a clear space together now we've both had time to cool off.  Thank you!", "I'm not a surgeon, but their job is literally cutting people open. It's not the same. Yes, someone being cut open is at a risk of death. That's why you sign **informed consent** forms before they cut you open, unless you're unconscious. \n\nBeing in a car is a risk of death, but it shouldn't be increased by gross negligence. Your spouse and other people die in a car crash you could have prevented, how do you feel? \n\nThe thing that gets me is that he lied right to her face after making a mistake she could have died from. A stupid idiot lie: \"I didn't know almonds counted toward your nut allergy\" or \"I didn't know this **almond granola** had allergens in it\" but somehow also knew enough about it that he knew not to bring it inside the house? \n\nNo, I've never made a mistake like that. But if I did, the response wouldn't be, \"Why are you mad at me?\" because I'd deserve the anger. It also wouldn't be some dumbass lie. It would be something like my other sincere apologies: \"Wow babe I am so sorry I really fucked up. I'm gonna go throw that away **right now** and vacuum the car. I'll do my best to never do it again\" \n\nWhy is it ok to you that he took no responsibility at all? \n\nIt's not the fuck up as much as it is his reaction afterward. If my spouse put me at risk like that and then lied to my face? Yeah, I'd lose some trust until they could earn it back. I think that's fair, and I'd expect to be treated the same if I acted that way.", "Same for my kid and I have him carry it in his school backpack now that he\u2019s in high school -just in case. We also keep peanut butter in the house -we\u2019re very careful about clean up and don\u2019t eat it when he\u2019s home, but we do still have it. I make sure to brush my teeth and wash my hands after eating it. No issues in 16 years.", "Allergies can change over time. I have a friend that used to be mildly allergic to cinnamon. She would be fine popping Benadryl before eating cinnamon buns. But as she got older the allergy got worse (most likely from her doing this) and by the time I became friends with her in college, her throat would start closing up if there was even cinnamon in the air.", "Allergies change over time. And I am allergic to things and carry 2 epi pens at a time because 1 epi pen is only good for about 15 min and the hospital is over 30 min away. Most people should have 2 epi pens with them because 1 doesn't last very long.", "Can you not read? Slightly allergic oats. *VERY ALLERGIC* to eggs and nuts.\n\nWe're talking about exactly the same ballpark here. She always carries epipens with her. We'll be out on the piss and I'll have an EpiPen in my pocket that barely fits. But it's always with us. It has to be.\n\nMy point was OP shouldn't be surprised if he sneaks the occasional nutty snacks in his car on the way to work but doesn't tell her. Imposing such Draconian rules about her living space and presumably being as aggressive as she said she was in the post is likely what led him to being secretive.\n\nI don't hide away my love of food from my gf and she doesn't get aggressive and start accusing me of stuff. Instead we keep it clear, consistent, and fair to avoid allergic reactions but also have a healthy relationship.", "yeah she keep *two on her at all times*. thats not a mild allergy. \n\nepipens are expensive, even if covered by insurance, and they expire after a few years. i have several allergies i need an epipen for but i havent gotten one in years because of the price and the chance of me having a reaction is slim.\n\nthe fact the she carries two imo says how severe this is.", "No. I'm not ignorant. I'll do a little extra explaining, and go into some extra depth that I didn't think was necessary for the point I was making.\n\nI never, and I mean never, cook with anything she's allergic to in our house. And I'm relentless with my family to ensure she has a safe environment when we go round to their houses, as they get it, but don't at the same time if you know what I mean.\n\nIf I eat something she's allergic to I'll not kiss her until I've got home and brushed my teeth and washed my mouth out. I'm personally quite respectful of the ruling I can eat what I want. 99% of the time I'm eating stuff that she can eat, but a man's gotta have a toblerone every now and then. And who can blame me for having an egg with my full English while we're out having a family breakfast at the pub.\n\nI've got to mention, I fully understand the debilitating effect of anxiety on a person, and the amount of anxiety brought upon by allergies is something to be respected at all times.\n\nThis is also by no means an extensive list, and I am very much not ignorant of severe allergies.", "And again. A decade of no mistakes. Now he ate a bar and either didn't read it or forgot to clean up. Yes it's not the same, that isn't his job. My point was even in situations where people know what to do they make mistakes even when their sole task at that time is not making mistakes. Eating something on the go and leaving the trash on the floor. A mistake definitely in this case. Not gross negligence in my book. It's not like he forgot etc and put something in her food or anything like that. He ate a bar forgot for the first time in a decade and she was coming at him like he intentionally put her life at risk. Totally understandable to be in the defensive. I really don't understand how people can say that when they are in a level headed situation that surely they would act a certain way in a situation they have never been in. And I didn't say his reaction was right, I just said it was human, just like the mistake. These things happen, they shouldn't but they do. \n\nAnd understandable that she was upset. But saying they can't be trusted is imo a bit harsh. He has managed not to make mistakes for a decade, obviously he cares. He'll  probably be even more careful and won't make another mistake.\nAnd why on earth was she assuming intent behind it instead of mistake.", "Considering the nuts can kill op in SECONDS yes read well SECONDS  STFU . \n\nYou have no idea what your talking about. \n\nAlso your gf might not have the same allergy ( some people are allergic only when ingested others can be allergic to contact or a third category allergic to the point of when being near that item in a space a reaction starts) and you shouldn't compare them as there are different types of allergens and allergies and different degrees that people are affected by them.\n\n And surprise! Other people can actually have a worse degree  allergy than the serious ones your gf has to eggs and nuts .", "To be fair, I have a mild peanut allergy and two epipens (that's standard practice) and my doctor would really prefer I have them on me at all times. Because peanut allergies can escalate quickly into deadly reactions.", "AND they were in HIS car which she was borrowing.  Probably he either didn\u2019t realize they were still in his car or she used the car unexpectedly"]}
