We don't typically eat out because I have severe food allergies (shellfish, tree nuts, and peanuts) but we do have a short list that I'm comfortable. As I was driving down our street, I looked over and saw an open snack package on the passenger floor. Husband and I both keep our cars neat so it jumped out at me.  I knew that 2 weeks ago we returned from celebrating our 10 year anniversary; I assumed we just missed some  trash.\n\nI got to a stoplight, I reached over and grabbed it.  I saw that it was a bag of Almond Granola. I'm highly allergic (ie: I have to carry 2 epi-pens) to nuts. Our home and shared spaces are nut free. When my husband and I dated, I shared about my allergies and he more than willingly gave up nuts to ensure my safety. Seeing this in our vehicle was surprising and anxiety inducing.\n\n I had no idea if there was nut residue on the steering wheel or in my seat and I was truly worried that I was going to have a reaction. Upon arriving at home, I entered it stoically and immediately washed my hands and remained quiet; from both the anxiety of the what if and being hurt hurt that my husband had something that was lethal to me in his car.\n\nHe saw that something was wrong and probed me for a bit. I finally asked him if he had something in his car that might not be good for me. He had no idea what I was referring to, so I told him. Immediately he put up a wall. Said that his mother (who he visited a week ago and knows about my allergies) gave him the snacks as he was leaving.  He had \"no idea\" there were nuts in them. My husband is an engineer.  Educated.  I struggled to understand how he wouldn't realize something called \"almond granola\" had nuts.\n\nHe doubled down and told me that it wasn't his fault and he had nothing to feel bad about. He didn't purchase it.  He didn't ask for it. It was just in his car. After all, he didn't bring it into the house. For 10 years he hasn't brought nuts into our home nor ate them. I told him that I held him to a higher standard and said that I had to be hyper vigilant to ensure I didn't touch or eat something that would make me very sick or worse and had always assumed he did the same thing. He shot back that again, this wasn't his fault. His mom gave it to him. He didn't know it was nuts. And it wasn't in the house so I shouldn't be upset.\n\nI told him, after this went on, that I felt like I couldn't trust him and we were back to square one when it came to my allergies because I wondered what else he didn't pick up on and what he wouldn't notice in the future. He told me I was over reacting, that he wasn't at fault as this was no harm and no foul and I didn't even have a reaction.\n\nIt felt so out of character for him, so it truly makes me wonder if I'm being the asshole here by telling him I can't trust him anymore.", "created_utc": 1682306074, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12x132b/aita_for_telling_my_husband_i_cannot_trust_him/", "score": 552, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Maybe it came from another passenger that doesn't have any clue about you or your nut allergy?\n\nEdit: The first time I read this, I read it as being the leftover, empty bag from already consumed granola. After re-reading it was an unopened bag, I think OP still has a right to be upset & scared for what appears, to her, to be her husband's sudden carelessness & lack of regard for her life-threatening allergy. It boggles my mind he would accept it from his mom in the first place.", "Info: do you believe what he said - that his mom gave him some snacks and he scarfed it down while driving and didn\u2019t notice what it was?", "YTA. Nothing you've said indicates that he has a pattern of disregarding this issue, so you're basically saying that he's lying when he says he didn't know. If he is, in fact, lying, then it would change my opinion, but on the face of it, you would be the one actively damaging your relationship by holding his feet to the fire over this.", "Ask his mom if she gave it to him. If she didn't, then someone is lying and you've got more than one huge issue to address here.\nNTA.", "If you're allergic to the point where residue on the steering wheel could make you need to EpiPen yourself, then he NEEDS to be a part of that. The fact that he has been doing it for 10 years proves that this wasn't ignorance, it was apathy. He didn't want to tell his mom no, then he forgot about them, and needed an excuse to not be the one to blame. 100% NTA here. There needs to be a nonconfrontational conversation about this and about what happens going forward. If he wants that kind of thing in his car, then it needs to be understood and agreed upon, since it will mean that you cannot be in his car anymore.", "YTA. If this is what it takes to break your trust after 10 years, you don't have enough trust in your relationship.", "ESH? NAH? \n\nAlmonds I believe are classified as seeds, most people with nut allergies have no reaction at all to them. It's not unreasonable to me he'd glance at a pack of gifted mixed snack, not see \"nuts\" and just keep them for emergency car snacks. The way you've written this post is like you're accusing him of trying to murder you.\n\nHe was however weirdly defensive and could've just said \"sorry babe, I didn't think it was on the bad list, I'll go clean the car\". Especially since you say you're allergic to tree nuts as well as regular, it seems like something he'd be cautious of. \n\nIdk, it reads to me like you came in accusing him of gross misconduct and he immediately put up a defensive wall instead of having a polite conversation.", "NTA.  \n\n\nLet's say it's true that his mom gave it to him. Whatever. But if that was the case he still could have 1) Said \"no thank you.\" 2) Taken it to be polite, then toss it in the garbage, or 3) at the very least, NOT OPEN IT IN THE CAR.   \n\n\nThe fact that he opened it in a space he knows you share is the biggest problem for me. And the fact that he's obviously lying about not knowing it had nuts?! Good luck OP!", "if he had immediately gone \u201coh fuck, I fucked up, I\u2019m sorry\u201d then he could argue that it\u2019s one mistake in 10 years.\n\nBut he got defensive. He said that his mistake happened because he\u2019s too stupid to realise it had nuts in or check for nuts. And he\u2019s too spineless to tell his mum to not give him things with nuts. Unless he grows a brain overnight, how is he going to stop it from happening again? If he doesn\u2019t take some responsibility for it, then there\u2019s absolutely nothing he is doing to stop it happening again. If he\u2019s too stupid to be hypervigilant about nuts, then of course you can\u2019t trust him to be hypervigilant about nuts.\n\nAlso if it\u2019s fine because it wasn\u2019t in the house, either he knew there was nuts so left it in the car on purpose, or it was a complete coincidence it got left in the car so his defence that it wasn\u2019t in the house is bullshit.", "!updateme", "YTA - and frankly you're a bit of a bully", "YTASounds like extreme gaslighting to me. You need to apologize.  \nIt also sounds like you do similar things to him often, which is probably why he (possibly) made up the story about his mom. He felt caught and cornered, at least from how you tell the story.", "YTA stop being so hysterical", "YTA. You have an allergy. You said yourself that it is rare for your husband to bring nuts into the house. Why are you berating him for making a single mistake? Sure, he could apologise for not remembering he out nuts in the car a week ago. But people tend to lose empathy when none is afforded to them. He made a mistake. There was no malice.", "YTA", "YTA. Also you walked into the house and stayed quiet and then when he mentioned it you responded with a shitty remark, kind of like a\nChild.", "YTA. You came off and attacked him after making him ask what was wrong. What you SHOULD have done was be an adult, come in and wash your hands, and then ask him (you know, the whole communication thing that as an adult you should be capable of) \"I saw this in the car, you know my allergy, can you please explain?\".\n\nNo. Instead, you waited for him to ask what was wrong (making him pry for information) and then blew up on him. If this is what it takes to break the trust of someone you've been married to for 10 years, then do HIM a favor and leave because you never trusted him in the first place.", "NTA - what if you\u2019d had a reaction while driving? You could have had no warning, been speeding down the highway, and contagion from the steering wheel or seats could have hit you. \n\nThis is a very dangerous situation, and the people blowing it off have no idea how quickly allergies can become life-threatening. I wouldn\u2019t trust your husband if I were you, and would ask for couples therapy to try to save the relationship.", "Yta. \n\n1 mistake in 10 years.\n\nIt was his car, it's not like he left it in your car.", "YTA.  He screws up one time in over 10 years of being together and you are pretty much acting like he tried to murder you.  Give him the benefit of the doubt.  Otherwise it is just you being unreasonable and impossible to please.  If 10 years of being vigilant means nothing to you, you need to reevaluate.", "YTA \n\nYou may be on the brink of a dangerous anaphylactic shock and when he asks you if everything is ok you play the passive agressive game of guess what's wrong?\n\nYou drive all the way to your home with an open package of death, then grab it to throw it in the garbage?\n\nI think in this situation, littering, while still wrong would've been mandatory.\n\nNo offense but kinda seems like you wanted drama instead.", "Why did everyone right away accuse him of having an affair?? He probably bought it for himself but forgot to throw it away so he tried to put the blame on his mom which is a bit of AH. Yes, he should be cautious since his wife is allergic to nuts but at the same time i understand if he craves n wants to eat food that has nuts too consider that he has been accommodating w op diet for more than 10 years...", "Nta - if he TRULY didn't know it had nits, that would be terrifying. I completely get why now you are afraid of what else he might have missed. \n\nIts like either he is lying to you or he has no idea how to protect you. Both are bad. Sheesh", "Yta.  You are making a lot out of this.  It isn\u2019t a trust violation.  It\u2019s a mistake.", "If he ate it/ was around it 1 week ago, came home (probably touched you) and you didn't have any reaction - what is the issue?\n\nYou were driving with it in the car and had no reaction too - what's the issue?\n\nWhy are you creating an issue unnecessarily?\n\nYTA", "Yeah, YTA. I can tell just by the way you related the story and especially you telling him that because of this one incident in over a decade of being together, you can't trust him anymore (your words).\n\nYou had an epipen at hand, so even if you began to have a reaction to the almond granola and immediately used the epinephrine, it wouldn't be lethal and at worst you and your hubby would spend some quality time together at the ER. Instead, you got home and chewed him a new one, when you could've used a bit of tact and humor and given him some credit for only nearly killing you once in ten years of marriage.\n\nedited to remove second judgmental statement", "YTA for the way you handled this. I also have a tree nut allergy and while we\u2019ve only been with my wife for 5 years, I\u2019ve always spoken to her in her rare slips", "Almonds are not nuts. As someone with a nut allergy (among others) you should know that. Either this story nonsense or you don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re actually allergic to and neither option makes you look good.

I'm sorry, I see very little hope for this relationship.", "NTA \n\nWhat if he ate it right before he kissed you or you took a sip from his coffee mug? \n\nDoes he not check his foods for your allergens at all?\n\nHis carelessness and defensiveness makes him the AH. You have lost trust, and you are not the AH for being honest about that.", "Lmao all these people calling the husband the asshole don't even know that almond is not a nut. The wife is also driving husband's car, not the other way around. YTA", "He probably eats things with nuts in his car frequently and forgot to throw it out this time. It's hard for people to follow a diet that doesn't pertain to them.", "ESH. You for the overreaction. You could have calmly asked him instead of backing him into a corner. In your post, you also belittle him. \n\nIt could have been an honest mistake. But him denying his mistake in ANY part was an AH move.", "He made his first mistake in 10 years. He probably eats nuts away from you but washes hands, brushes teeth etc and you\u2019ve never one had a reaction. He always keeps it out of the house and follows all the rules. \n\nWas he maybe getting defensive because you went in guns blazing?  For a first infraction you could have sat him down talked it out instead. \n\nThere was another post a while back where the OP\u2019s also had a severe nut allergy.

Yes it's your allergy but you announced it 10 years ago and he does need to help make sure he doesn't bring back nut residue\n\n\nIt's complete BS for people to decide how something effects someone, \"I don't see it as a big deal so it isn't one\" screw you that choice isn't up to you, it's her health she sees nuts in the car which she grabbed not knowing what it was she could have been going to the hospital instead WHY RISK IT??", "NTA\n\nI would ask his mom if she gave it to him.  \n\nIf she did, I would remind her of your allergies.\n\nIf not, I would be investigating.", "Oh baby booboo \nGrow TF up baby\nAccidents happen", "NTA.

(i guess?)\n\nbut again it never came into the house! this is such a non issue. And maybe instead of giving him 'stoic' (whatever that means to this situation) how about communicating with him? Wash your hands and simply ask him? \"hey i saw a packet of almond granola in your car. could he let you know before you use his car just so you can be aware and careful\"\n\nESH. You both need communication and this is such a non issue to react about.", "Yeah my immediate thought was someone was riding over there and eating and left there trash.\n\nHad husband eaten it or even looked at it he would be aware there was almonds.", "Or, he really likes nuts and keeps some as a snack in his car to indulge when he is not around her. He must be washing his hands and brushing his teeth since she hasn't had a reaction. She has an allergy, and they both have to live under her restrictions. She isn't a child, and neither is he. In ten years, they have managed it, and she hasn't had a reaction. It doesn't seem it is something he can talk to her about because look how she reacted here to an empty bag of almond trail mix. Or closed, I'm not sure, but she was concerned about traces of it. Having an allergy sucks, but she seems beyond restrictive.\n\nIf he was cheating and kept his car so neat, don't you think he would have noticed that and got rid of the evidence?", "OP also says that they both keep their cars neat, and that it was out of the ordinary to the point it jumped out at her.", "Especially if you eat a granola nut bar, you have this stuff in your teeth for hours.

Especially when it\u2019s a literal life or death situation", "You really want to argue that it was totally okay for him to just casually leave a bag of something that could kill his wife in a car she used? A bag of something that could cause a deadly reaction while she was operating that said 1 ton box of steel on the open road with other cars around her? Seriously?\n\nHis defence that he had no idea there were nuts in almond snacks is illogical. He clearly saw and knew they were not safe to take into his house. So he very much had some idea.", "How could he not know almond was a nut?!", "It's bizarre that the top answers are Y T A, like she should brush it off, shit happens. You realise it could have killed or hospitalised her? \n\nLike the husband wouldn't need to apologise for his mom leaving a hand grenade in the car because in the ten years before that he's never left a hand grenade in the car.

According to OP he made a point to specify he never even brought it in the house (which makes me think he knew exactly what was in there) and knowing your wife is severely allergic and you don't even check the ingredients before going home and kissing her?

It's not a matter of just administering an epi pen, and she'll be right. It's a hospital trip and potential death if you can't get to the hospital on time. An epi pen doesn't get you out of trouble, necessarily. And you can never know how you're going to react. One episode you may have a mild skin reaction, yet during another you may get full on anaphalaxis. For me, it's the way OP's husband reacted. Rather than owning up to his mistake, he's taking no responsibility at all. That makes it harder for OP to trust him.", "If he ate allergens for the past 10 years and she never found out it means he is EXTREMELY careful. Because...10 years?? No mistake? Why would he suddenly leave a package lying around so easy to spot? And why would his mother do that? She knows about the allergies. Maybe if she is some very evil person but OP didn't mention that.

Im guessing that's why OP doesn't have/show any reaction after contacting with almond??", "Rule 1: Be civil", "[removed]", "If it was sealed, then I find her reaction even more bizarre. That would mean hubby got the nuts, thought about his wife's allergies and decided not to even open them, forgot them in the car, wife found them and loses her shit over NOT coming in contact with nuts? Okay.", "Right, but he also ate them a week prior. So, maybe he waddling he didn't know they were nuts, more like he didn't know there were nuts in the car.", "He got defensive. And while he handled it poorly, her approach wasn't the best either. She asked, he didn't remember, and then got defensive since wife was accusing instead of communicating. The likeliness of him feeling like shit and trying to defend himself not just from her but the guilt he feels is understandable in the situation, even if that doesn't make it right. A very human thing to make a mistake even after a decade of not making such a mistake. These things happen. Even the best surgeons sometimes make mistakes in routine operations. And often find it hard to accept they made a stupid mistake and initial reaction is to shift blame. Why does reddit always seem to believe there's something much larger going on and not human error.

He ate it in the car and forgot to clean up. This is the most likely scenario. Who knows why he forgot or made a mistake and does it matter. If it's the first mistake in a decade. I doubt he'll make the same mistake again. Heck I've forgotten to beware my own allergies in a year more than he has his wife's in a decade. \n\nDo you never make mistakes?

Is she writing this post from the hospital?", "People with \"tree nut allergy\" are also allergic to almonds sadly.", "It could also explain the husband\u2019s defense that he didn\u2019t know that the snack contained nuts.

It feels like as soon as hubby knew he\u2019d screwed up he got defensive and wanted to be right more than he cared about the possible consequences to OP. And that\u2019s a problem. His Mum is also a problem, giving nuts to hubby. I get the impression OP is allergic enough that if OP had eaten it and then gone and kissed OP it would be hospital.

Cuz usually nut has lot of small residue so i assume if the husband forgot to throw the packet then he may also forget to clean the steering and seats?? \n\nBtw I do think allergies should be taken seriously!! I only comment cuz i didn't know almonds aren't truly nuts but still considered as tree nuts?? \ud83d\ude05", "[removed]", "Maybe hubby got defensive because he hasn't made this mistake in the last 10 years.

Her allergies are her problem. She is not entitled to other people accommodating her. Her has volunteered to do so. He's done a great job so far, so maybe OP could've been less accusatory and more delicate about the f*ck up. When a person isn't afforded empathy, they tend not to show it. So I can understand why her husband didn't apologise. She didn't really give him a chance before going straight to interrogation and saying hurtful things. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, his mom probably gave him the snacks because she knows he likes them and hasn't been able to freely eat them at home for the last 10 years? Again, if OP was deathly allergic, she would've had a reaction a week ago when he came home with almond breath. I think this is a lot of anxiety and not really an allergy. I have known people with severe allergies and administer epi's. After a week of being around the nut residue, she should've already had a reaction. I think that's also why hubby isn't falling over himself to apologise. Maybe he knows that there was no real risk of losing his wife.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing with that.

He was driving his mom around (I guess). She was eating the almond granola (it was opened, right)? She was leaving, so she left it for him. He didn't eat it, didn't care to even pay attention to what it was, hence why he didn't notice it had nuts and most importantly why it was left **on the floor** of the car. Who leaves food they intend to eat on the floor?\n\nFast forward a week, you find the almond granola. You get (justifiably) very stressed. But the part where you're not justified is when you go home and, instead of handling it like an adult, you give in to your emotions. You came at him offensively, so naturally he's gonna be defensive. You didn't ask, you didn't seek information or clarity, you straight up jumped to assuming he was at fault. Assuming he knew, assuming he was intentionally negligent, uncaring and what not.\n\nSo ask yourself, do you really have a reason to think he was negligent and uncaring? Did he really deserve to be accused of being untrustworthy?

It's not a big deal\n\nFixed that for you", "This whole story is \"I found a packet of something I'm allergic to in the car, nothing happened, and I made it a huge deal and can't trust my partner now\" there is no logic to it but of course he must be the worst person ever for having a packet of allergens once in ten years that caused no problems OP didn't push to create", "Also, repeated exposure can slowly make an allergic reaction worse so even if it *was* mild (it's not) it can still be dangerous to have exposure", "Gotcha", "Personally it does seem OP might be an asshole.\n\nMy gf is very allergic to eggs and nuts, slightly allergic to oats and one or 2 other bits. I keep things containing her allergies separate and let her know when I've eaten them so she won't come into contact with it and blister up etc. She'd hate to deprive me of food I love, as she was allergic to milk until she was about 13 so had never had chocolate etc until then.\n\nWe keep it clear, consistent, and fair. I understand how traumatic allergies can be on all aspects of life, but OPs rules seem incredibly Draconian towards her partner. Likely why he's had a secret nut treat he likes in his car but forgot to get rid of the evidence. Poor dude.", ">I looked over and saw an open snack package on the passenger floor", "The bag of almond granola however wasn't in another bag, there was nothing to hide the name of almond granola. Unless he just blindly took a snack when his partner has several potentially life threatening food allergies that could be contained in common snacks.", "The point is that the husband put something deadly to OP in the car. The fact that she didn't die doesn't change this fact. People do make mistakes, and one could argue there's room to cut him some slack, but do not downplay the very real danger involved here. She \"didn't die\" isn't a good excuse.", "Her being dead is the same either way.", "An allergic to nuts. Keep forgetting to not eat granola bars. \n\nI ate the basic oats and honey ones for years and it had no nuts directly but I assume they\u2019re all made at the same factory, so if you look closely it says may contain nuts.", "It's obvious he should have read it. And then seems unable to just apologize.", "Yeah. \u201cIs there something you need to tell me?\u201d That kind of questioning is destined to make someone react defensively. OP was already angry before bringing it up. \n\nThey both handled this poorly. OP should give her husband some grace since this isn\u2019t a pattern. Husband should give OP some grace for having a legitimate concern about her health.", ">Why does reddit always seem to believe there's something much larger going on and not human error.\n\nBecause most people do not apply Hanlon's Razor.  They see malic because they read in their own biases.", "Almonds do affect people with allergy to tree nuts. Regardless of the taxonomy, they are nuts to your body", "People shouldn't have to drag out what you're mad and would like to talk about.

The other person can snack on almonds all day without an issue.", "Not necessary.\nMy kid can eat almonds with top level but allergies", "I think after 10 years, hubby should know exactly what his wife is deathly allergic to.

Many tree nut averse people can regularly munch down a whole bag of almonds.", "OP saw an open snack package, as in one of those littles bags of granola nut mixes, not a package of snacks that included an open bag of almond granola. And snack package does not insinuate that it was snacks inside an open plastic grocery store bag either.", "or hubby has been really good about washing up and brushing his teeth.

If he has managed 10 years and hasnt endangered her life, her jumping on him like this wouldnt have given him confidence. \"My best isnt good enough apparently.\" kinda thing", "It kinda sounded like the I can\u2019t trust you came after his defensiveness. I don\u2019t think she would have said that if he just started apologizing. Deathly allergies seem like a trip, to walk around with anxiety that a stupid nut could take you out probably makes you super paranoid and sensitive. I understand why she\u2019s upset her husband might not be a safe space for her and now she is anxious with her partner of 10 years", "I guess almonds have a high risk of \"cross contamination\" from other nuts, but I am by no means an allergy expert.

I guess it could just be a linguistic difference and we don't know which of it is because op hasn't answered and this post likely isn't real bc of that", "Hey, I am not discounting the toll continuous, extensive amounts of stress take on our behaviour. But OP needs to realise that it was her disproportionate actions that got her this defensive reaction. It's not helpful to say her actions were justified because anxiety sucks. Yes, anxiety definitely sucks but it's her responsibility to make sure her anxiety doesn't negatively impact her spouse's mental well-being. Asshole is too strong a verdict for either party, but OP doesn't have the moral here, in my opinion, mainly because she has had 10 years to learn how to manage her mental health.", "True. To me \"open snack package\" followed by immediate fear of nut residue indicates that it's similar to one of those bags of snack mix you'd get at a gas station, or if his mom gave it to him, one of those bags of nature valley granola.", "I\u2019m in two minds here. Because I can understand that while everywhere else, OP has to be constantly vigilant, she had a reasonable expectation that her house and their cars, being shared spaces, would be nut free, and I have sympathy to the shock of feeling like a safe space had been violated. \nHowever your point about her having been able to be in the car with the open packet, and handle it, does have me querying the severity. \nAnd I also really don\u2019t like how she went about it - very passive aggressive - even if I think she had grounds to be upset. \n\nBut yeah, if hubby didn\u2019t realise almonds were nuts, how did it take a decade for this incident to occur, or is she not as sensitive to almonds as she thinks (a friend has a nut allergy, but it is not equal across all nuts, macadamias are horrendous, hazelnuts are ok, and there is a spectrum for others). \n\nSo yeah, mixed feelings. But I\u2019m not sure anyone handled this well.", "I feel like her reaction was based on the conversation. It ended up at the extreme because of the defensiveness. If someone left a loaded gun in the car and was like oops my mom gave it to me, how should I know, I\u2019m perf then I would also get very frustrated and get to the how do I trust you if you made a mistake but you can\u2019t handle me being upset about it. I do agree they both need to work on communication and probably see a therapist because this conversation sounds like a lot of stuff is happening under the surface."]}
