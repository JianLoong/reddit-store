She also pays another $200 a month for him to have a dog walker. \n\nLea\u2019s cat, Sunny, eats a more basic food and treats, doesn\u2019t have pet insurance, and Lea only puts $15 a month aside for him.

I get that that's supposed to be Lea's responsibility and her not doing it is an issue that should be addressed, but it's needlessly cruel to confine the animals outside of the time it's actually necessary and losing students over it on principle seems crazy. At first glance this seems like a really bad arrangement for everyone involved - you, your daughters, your students, and the animals.", "INFO - why didn\u2019t Mila just pick up the cat and put him in Lea\u2019s room? You shouldn\u2019t keep a cat locked up longer than necessary. That\u2019s just cruel.

I don\u2019t really have an opinion on if you are or aren\u2019t the A-hole in this situation but I am curious if there is generally some truth to cat child\u2019s claim that you favor the dog.", "YTA, that's a completely ridiculous policy.\n\nBoth of you (OP and Mila, the ones who tutor students) should recognize that you live in a home with animals.  If you have a student for whom it's IMPORTANT that they not be around animals, you shouldn't tutor that student out of your home.  Go to a coffeeshop or library or some other space and do it there.  OR, YOU take responsibility for making sure the home is ready for that student before they come.  \n\nI don't blame you for expecting Lea to help out but the degree of punishment here is utterly unreasonable.  Mila never would have lost the student if she had truly been conscientious about the animals issue in the ways I suggested.  \n\nNot to mention - where does Lea even get the money to pay this?  \n\nBottom line - charging a teenager $450 for failing to close their door three times is way beyond reasonable.", "How do you even know the student left because of the pets? Kinda bold assumption in my opinion. \n\nI don\u2019t think anyone who has serious enough allergies to warrant leaving a tutor would attend tutoring in someone\u2019s house that owns pets. It\u2019s not the presence of the pets but the pet dander. Which is basically unavoidable inside someone\u2019s home.", "YTA. If there are students that shouldn\u2019t be around animals then they shouldn\u2019t be studying in your home in the first place. When you get animals it\u2019s THEIR home too.

Your 20 is capable of getting the cat out of the way. Regardless, if a student is severely allergic, you & your daughter are idiots for thinking it would be okay for them to be in your home at all. Fur & dander is still present. At that, using a common space in a house where the 16 year old also lives & imposing nonsense is an AH move. Honestly, I\u2019m not even sure I believe all of this.\n\nI\u2019m paying 30/month for insurance & my dog has 95% of costs covered.

Mila can work a full time job to get more money and will get paid more for her age, whereas Lea can only work part time, that shows favouritism right there.

Is there maybe some other, less obvious inequity she is fixated on that hasn't been noticed, communicated, or addressed?\n\nSince you seem big on contracts and plans, maybe have her enumerate her specific problems and draw up a plan to address them.

In her view, you and Mila re the A H.\n\nNTA, and have a good talk with Lea. She can't have a pet without being responsible for it. You asked for something reasonable, she didn't respect that. FAFO.", "Not really the A, but I can't condone getting a pet and then rehoming it for being inconvenient. \n\nI think you did everything really well (making your kids do research, create savings plans, help out by matching savings, addressing potential consequences ect). Not only does this help your kids to prepare to be responsible adults, but you also drove the point home that choices have consequences.\n\n My only issue with what I see as otherwise being a very practical and well-thought out plan, is that teenagers don't think like adults do because THEIR BRAINS ARE NOT FULLY DEVELOPED. As much as we'd like to think teens are tiny adults with giant attitudes, this is scientifically false and adolescents go through an important period where their brains create all sorts of neural pathways that later get trimmed, similar to brain developmental activities when kids are around 3 years old. \n\nSo when your daughter is shocked by consequences...I mean teens aren't unintelligent, but they also don't have fully developed brains. So your daughter can handle consequences, but you can't entirely blame her for them either. As the parent, you are responsible filling in that gap, so to speak. \n\nNTA for how you went about this, but TA for potentially traumatizing an animal by rehoming it. \n\nFor the people saying that you can't put a cat in a small room for a few hours...sorry, what!?!?! Cats will sit in a bowl that's 4 x smaller than them, intentionally. Comfortably. I mean if there is no food or water or anything to keep the cat occupied, then yes that's an issue. But putting it in a room that it would likely spend time in anyways? That's bad? Make it make sense.", "YTA.\n\nYes, Lea should be responsible for putting her cat in her room if you are having students in your home that can't be around animals.  \n\nBut for goodness sake, you and Mila need to be adults about this if Lea forgets.  It is not that hard to put the cat in Lea's room and insure that it has food, water and a litter box.  Make Lea do extra chores or something to compensate, but charging her for lost income is far too much to put on a 16 year old.  \n\nOP, Lea didn't cause you to lose students.  Your and Mila's refusal to act in the best interests of the kids you tutor did.  Honestly, if I were a parent of one of the kids you tutor, I'd wonder what was wrong with you for not doing one simple thing to insure that my child's needs were met, and you would not have been tutoring my kid after the first time you didn't act like a responsible adult.  Why don't you have an area of the house to work with students that is off limits to the pets?\n\nAlso, if the cat is in Lea's room while she's not home, do you just leave it in there until Lea comes home?  Are you expecting her to put the cat in her room well in advance of your students' arrivals if Lea will be out of the house?  Does the cat do well left in Lea's room for long periods of time?  Most cats should be fine being in one room for a few hours at a time, but if you do absolutely nothing for the cat when Lea isn't home, I'm wondering if Lea thinks that her cat is getting unfair treatment because Sunny winds up confined more than the dog does, solely because of Lea's school or work schedule.\n\nWhile I do think that your overall rules and conditions for your daughters having pets are generally reasonable, it's completely unfair and unreasonable to act as if a 16 year old can financially support a pet in the same way a 20 year old can.  All pets need good food, stimulating toys and interaction, and routine vet visits.  If you weren't on board in any way with offering financial support to your children in an equitable manner, then you should never have agreed to let your daughters have pets in the first place.", "NTA - It\u2019s important to teach Lea to be accountable. I disagree with the Redditors who say that you or your other daughter should have moved the cat. The entire reason you made your kids sign a contract is to have your children accept that their pet is solely their responsibility. Lea is old enough to take care of her pet and understand the rules.", "YTA who adopted a pet on behalf of a literal child with rehoming ever being an option.

Every cat I've had has outpriced my family's dogs in terms of care and supplies", "Litter is more expensive too. Your logic is flawed. You're the asshole for the favoritism.", "But like... why can't you or Mila grab the cat and put it in Lea's room?", "If a student can't be near animals (specifically dogs or cats), that student should not be in your home AT ALL.  What part of this do you not understand?", "The expectation is stupid if someone is allergic to an animal especially the allergy being so bad they can\u2019t be near them. The student shouldn\u2019t be in your house at all if they have an allergy that bad. If someone can\u2019t be near animals I assume they can\u2019t be near remanence of an animal and cats and dogs shed a lot so either way she most likely would have lost this student.

Why is it that the student \"can't be near animals\"?", "I feel like it costs more to have a dog, unless they are small and don't need grooming, etc.. Usually dogs eat more and vet care is more.

What was the point of that?\n\n(Putting aside the fact that if the student was allergic, they wouldn\u2019t be able to be in the house at all.) \n\nIt seems like you and Mila set Lea up for failure. Your unnecessarily convoluted pet ownership parameters are obviously going to favor Mila since she\u2019s older and likely has more money. \n\nYou\u2019ve taken what should have been a life lesson for Lea (teaching responsibility, work ethic, how to handle money, etc) and made it into a punishment. All she learned from this is that her mom and sister would rather be petty than help her out at all. \n\nYTA.", "Everyone agrees YTA stop trying to defend yourself and accept the judgement.

A quick google search will tell you otherwise. No expert will tell you that it's okay to confine a cat for that long, that often.\n\n\nIf each of you had one tutoring session a week for an hour, that seems reasonable.

Do most people you know do this to their pet multiple times a week for several hours?", "That was not the question. Does Lea gets a cut of the income for the inconvenience?\nWhy didn't you other daughter make sure the cat is out of the room? It's her student so her responsibility.\n What if Lea is out of the house before the student comes? Should the cat stay in her room the whole day? \nWhere is the cats litter box? In leas room? What if the cat needs to use it during the 2,5h? Should it just pee on some of Leas stuff?\nAnd btw a cat is not less expensive than a dog if it's an indoor cat. Cat litter, food and toys add up after a while.\nAnd a 20 year old has definitely more higher payed job opportunities than a 16 year old.\nI'm really angry on leas behalf. You blatantly favor your older daughter"]}
