Only our wedding party and parenta/siblings were invited to stay at the house and hang for those days. My friend was included in that group.\n\nThe day before we are set to go to the venue my friend says he wants more money. A lot more. I was pissed. We didn't have money in the budget for what he was asking. Had he discussed a bigger payment in advance we would have negotiated or saved more to afford it. But because it was so last minute I was super pissed and upset. I almost disinvited him. Instead, I told him to just attend as a guest. We got some family members to work together to film different parts. Tbh, the end result was terrible. A mess of editing and very poor quality with some major things that didn't get filmed. So yea.. It fucking sucked. I also downgraded my friend so he wasn't at the head table anymore. But he still came for the extended days and didn't help much at all and then didn't even get us a wedding gift. It was a whole shit show. Really made me see him differently. I would have been willing to pay him more if he had discussed it with me earlier, but this was just super unprofessional and crappy.\n\nBut your situation is totally different. They never asked you.

I eagerly looked forward to sharing the family's celebration and the joy of seeing these two people come together and start their lives together, and share the loving experience of these two families uniting as one.\n\nI packed as one would to be a guest at such an event. It was only upon my arrival that I was informed that I was *not* invited as a guest but was expected to work as a wedding videographer - a specialized job I do not hold and have not been trained for, and do not even have the proper equipment to do adequately. Had I been informed prior to arrival instead of being blindsided at the eleventh hour, I would have politely declined. After all, I want only the best for James and (Bride), and that includes having a professional, high quality wedding video that they can enjoy for decades to come. That is not something that I can provide. This is like asking a pie maker to bake and decorate a wedding cake with no warning, no equipment, and no information beforehand. It's setting them up for failure.\n\nI went to film school and was trained in cinematography, but my focus is on nature documentaries and stock footage and I am not trained as a wedding videographer. A wedding is a very different event, with different equipment required, at least 2 people staffed, and a thorough understanding of the logistics of the event participants, flow, and venue in order to execute well. In order to successfully fulfill this request to the level which James and Bride deserve, I would have had to have accepted the request (which I was never made aware of) long prior to the event and had several meetings with the bride and groom to plan logistics, equipment, etc. There is a reason that wedding videographers are often very expensive- it is time consuming before, during and after the event when a videographer may spend days editing, sound balance, rendering video, etc. It requires a lot of resources and expensive equipment I do not own, a qualified assistant at BARE minimum, and a thorough understanding of all aspects of the event. It is truly a production, and even had I been asked in advance I am not qualified to fulfill this role. The fact that I wasn't even consulted is an unfortunate oversight, but because of this I definitely would not be able to provide them the videography that their event deserves, even if I had accepted the job - which I would not, because it is not my area of specialization.\n\nI and my mother (who already told the family all of this long ago) have been disinvited to the wedding and kicked out of my grandmother's home for the duration of the event because I am unable to provide services that I do not provide and am not trained to provide. We are of course heartbroken not to be able to be there with the family for James and Bride's big day, but hope it will be a magical affair.\n\nWe will miss you all on this very special day that reflects on our family's bond and what it means to be a family, but will turn this negative into a positive by using the time to spend a little time bonding as mother and son.  We wish James and Bride the very best in their future together, and hope that in the future our family can work together on our communication skills so that issues like this don't occur in the future.\n\nSigned,\n\nOP\n\nEDIT: OR, cave and rent (shoddy, cheap but decent) equipment.

Heard their wedding went well.", "Thank you, I was very curious about what was the meaning, since I couldn't fit any words", "You just know that when he was younger and just started taking an interest in it that these same people would mock him for it too!", "I mean most wedding videographers are probably super booked, but I guess OP isn\u2019t a wedding videographer and they were okay with them doing their wedding so yeah I think that should work. \n\nAlthough they weren\u2019t gonna pay OP either\u2026", "I shot around 20 weddings professionally, but have since stopped doing them.\n\nI thought the anxiety I got for a full 2 days before the event would go away when I got more experience under my belt. It did not. Even shooting events for people I knew as friends.", "Godamn so regardless of country and culture, entitled people say the same shit. Can't say I wasn't surprised you got the same argument as I had.\n\nI imagine that you would have been pulled into some ungodly drama if you caved.", "Oh no nothing like that happened with my family.  I just know how people are when they really don\u2019t understand the complexities of videography. \n\nI got lucky when I filmed for friends. They loved the video.  But I haven\u2019t filmed in years & ended up being volunteered for my husbands cousin\u2019s wedding to a really nice woman.  I was REALLY stressed because I was rusty as heck at filming & editing. And that was a happy ending luckily. I did well & they loved it.  But the stress of \u201cwhat if\u201d I messed up. Or didn\u2019t get that important shot. All of my husbands family would have seen my failure.  And it would have been like a dark cloud over my head every time we all got together.  \n\nNope. I don\u2019t recommend filming for family.  Lol", "lmao", "These fools think an iPhone would be a good substitute for OP's kit. So clearly they are experts.

Redirect all the familial love to your mom, who had your back, and move on with significantly less dead weight", "No no no, it's making your grandma look bad. She promised something that your cousin never thought to ask. Your mom even said no on your behalf (way to go mom!) \n\nTo your family, \"I may have said yes had someone asked. No one asked. I guess mom and I will go and do something fun instead.\"\n\nNTA", "The audacity people have to offer other people\u2019s services without consulting them.

They expect you to do it for free without discussing it with you. Then I think you and mom should cancel in going to wedding and go do something else instead. Leave the family behind since they can't even ask you. I feel sorry that your mom have be the scapegoat for something she didn't even do.", "NTA, but why are you still there trying to stay there and explain? Your cousin obviously doesn't want you present as a GUEST for his wedding. He never did and your grandma doesn't give a damn about you since you have to leave her home. She had no business volunteering you and Cousin James and his Bride are idiots because what couple doesn't iron out the details for the videographer with the videographer before the wedding. I'd go home or somewhere nice to enjoy the remaining time of your vacation. If you bow down to James, then the rest of the family will expect you to do the same when other events come up.", "NTA, what kind of entitled nonsense is this? You didn't volunteer, you were volunteered by your grandmother without so much as a text to ask you, your mom stepped in and said that no, you would not do that (which is what you wanted)... And they still tried to force you to do it, for free no less? \n\nFuck 'em. If they wanted you to do it, they should've paid you, and you would have been well within your rights to refuse the work and just come as a guest.", "NTA. The only people making your family look bad are your cousin and grandma", "NTA - But, I would agree to do it and then use the family member\u2019s iPhone lol", "NTA, you were the last one to know about it and you're the bad guy? No one even thought of asking you if you could or were willing to do it.", "NTA.  I guess you have another niche to add to your professional bio......Mind Reading.  The entitlement gene is VERY strong in cousin, future wife & your grandma.  Since you & your mom have been disinvited to the wedding, you & your mom should go out on the day of the BBQ & wedding, paint the town RED & plaster it all on social media about the blast you both had & when folks inquire about your absence at the \"events\", lay your cards on the table for all to see.", "NTA. You were invited as a guest! Go enjoy your vacation with your mom. Your grandma needs to step in and look for someone else because she was the one who volunteered you without your consent.

Go to Paris. (And go NC with your toxic, AH, family).\n\nNTA", "NTA, don't you love it when others volunteer you on a professional basis, without your knowledge.  I am sure if your cousin was a plumber he would work for anyone in the family for free.", "Lol, not only were you not *hired* to be a videographer, you weren't even **informed** that it was expected of you! Damn, the audacity of some people. Let them be angry and resolve it among themselves. It's not your problem that someone promised someone else's time and effort *for free* and without even telling them! Grandma should do the photos since she's the one who screwed the pooch.

They at least asked me in advance . \n\nGlad I went.  The pro missed a crucial shot of the bride and groom at the altar, with the train swirled in front.  Out of all the photos, mine was the only one that had the whole gown.  I got the photo of my daughter, a junior brides maid, and gave the rest of the negatives to my friend, the mother of the bride.  \n\nFor two other friends, I  made brag books and gave them to them within a week.  They were delighted.   \n\nThese were  my choice, a gift to those families. I was able to prepare in advance and never got in the way of the pro.  Always after he got his shots in  .", "NTA. The offer was so good to be true that the cousin didn't bother to contact you and confirm? Also, your mum ready said no. Wow. I just can't...", "NTA because they sprang it on you. I think its reasonable to ask a family member to film or perform at your wedding IN LIEU of a wedding gift. (Though that would just be filming the ceremony, if they wanted to you working during the whole reception that would be different). Either way they didn\u2019t ask you\u2026 Not something you spring on someone the week of, it\u2019s something you bring up right around when you invite them.", "NTA\nWait so can I get this straight. They volunteered you to video the  wedding without telling you, which is super rude obviously. But.... If you didn't know.... Why would you have the equipment? Did your family REALLY assume you just have video equipment on you at all times? And their solutions were just bizarre. Recording a wedding on a phone? \n\nThe bride is pissed that you are \"selfish,\" she should be pissed by how stupid they are.", "I thought my family was full of assholes til I read this. NTA. Enjoy spending time with your mom. F those other folks. They aren't family. They're relations.", "nta, not only did they volunteer you for it, but never actually talked to you about it?  who tf does that???", "NTA. Who doesn't confirm something like the videographer for a wedding? Your cousin and the bride seem pretty stupid. Even if someone told them you would do it, that's something you make sure about.", "NTA- A stitch in time, e.g. \"Hey OP, seeing as you are super talented, would you film the wedding as your gift to me?\", saves nine. Arguments, in this case. That said I'd be sorely tempted to do it now. Then find someone who does a decent David Attenborough expression and get that thing a suitable commentary. \"Here we see the entitlebeasts gathering around the buffet table...\"", "NTA - These people are ridiculous as would you be if you cave in to their demands.", "NTA - I\u2019m a hairstylist and oh my fucking god, family is always flabbergasted when I tell them I don\u2019t work for free.", "This is hilarious. NTA. \n\nYour family are both inept and cheapskates.  That's a bad combination.

How about paying someone to be the videographer???? Theres an idea", "NTA. They only wanted you at the wedding to do the job, not as a family member.", "Omg sounds like they're prioritizing the actual wedding than having families gathered up for a special event", "NTA - tell them all to go and fry asparagus, or see if the pig has laid eggs. What a bunch of entitled assholes. Cut contact", ">  She tells me I\u2019m supposed to record my cousin\u2019s wedding for him. She volunteered me.   \n    \nNTA.  \"Grandma.  I didn't volunteer.  You decided.  Without telling me.  Of course I didn't bring my professional equipment on vacation.  Because you made a promise.  Not me.  This is your issue.  I understand you want me out.

Let her stew in what she has done.", "NTA!\n\nThey didn\u2019t even talk to you about it. \n\nYou and your mom should go find something else fun to do, because your family is just rude. \n\nHow dare they just expect you to do this when they didn\u2019t even ask?  You are a professional!\n\nMy guess is that they spent way too much on the dress or something else and didn\u2019t have enough cash to pay for a videographer.  \n\nWhat is it about weddings that turns people into such horrible people?  It\u2019s a day to enjoy your family and friends and celebrate!  \n\nWhen we got married (before cell phones) we bought five decent cameras and left them out for our guests to use to take photos of us and my mother in law surprised us by bringing a video camera bigger than her head to record the fun. We had a huge family party in the back yard, got married, and absolutely love all of the fun candid photos everyone took of us!", "NTA. \n\nIf they expected you to work, you should have received a contract with fees specified, not an invite.   \n\nJesus.   Not only is there the cost of equipment, insurance on that, especially with travel, but there's the time it takes to edit, photoshop,  prepare prints, format, and deliver the final product.   On top of not being able to relax and enjoy the wedding, no drinking, can't eat with everyone else, etc.   \n\nYup.    Get your hotel room, enjoy your vacation, and say goodbye to the moochers.", "They should have told their grandmother \"I'm expensive too, in fact I don't think my cousin can afford me\" \n\nNTA - If they expected them to be their videographer the least the could do is say something. They could have saved themself a trip.", "How incredibly rude and selfish they are.... This is unbelievably crass and hurtful.", "NTA.  Not only were you *not* hired to do this job, you were not even informed that anyone wanted you to do it until you were already there *without equipment.*  Further reinforcing the idea that you never agreed to do the job and were not even asked to do the job in any reasonable way.", "Dude, they even suggested that OP should just rent the equipment out of OP\u2019s own pocket as a gift\u2026 And now they\u2019re uninvited to the wedding just like that. Who the fuck does that???", "I hope OP tells all of this to the bride-to-be. She needs to know which kind of family she's marrying into. This sounds like all kinds of toxic bullcrap going on.", "Me too!", "Yeah, ones worth listening to don't do that.", "Go.  Enjoy your vacation.  Block any number that has harassed you.  Send a nice text/e-mail to the bride.  Say you were never hired.  Never asked.  And not one word was said to you.  Until you arrived.

Then enjoy your vacation.", "I would count taking the video as a gift by itself, and editing it as yet another gift.", "It\u2019s not just the shooting\u2014 there\u2019s a TON of editing in the backend. They take hours and hours of video and then compile it, the same way that any other type of filmmaker does. What they were asking for was so ridiculous.", "of course!", "This!!! Exactly!!! The bride and groom must speak with the videographer to iron out what time, people, and parts are to be included. The videographer needs to know what equipment to bring so that the desired angles are covered. These important conversations should be conducted in a timely fashion and not through grandma.

Even if OP lived 5 minutes away they are not going to bring their work kit to a wedding. I hope they don't have another cousin who is a chef, they'll be expected to bring food.", "Yes, weddings and newfound money.", "WTAF don't you go putting this on the bride. That young woman probably had enough on her mind. For all she knew, this aspect was handled by her fiancee/ fiancees side of the family, and all of a sudden the videographer drops out at the last second.

If you get a photographer and videographer who are really good, they know how to get good shots without being disruptive, getting in each other's way, or making everything revolve around their work.
