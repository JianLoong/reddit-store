Instead, their growing family stayed in this tiny (but high-ceilinged) flat, and she (an artist) and her engineer husband cleverly built loft bedrooms, incredibly engineered levered tables and other brilliant hacks (minimal furniture, lots of clever storage, much use of Asian-inspired floor seating, etc.), and their now family of 5 (and 2 cats) STILL live quite happily there after many years. \n\nYou do you.
