I have recently started therapy to help with my mental health issues. My therapist recommended that I sit down with the people who have hurt me and just get all the emotions out so i can move past and find my personal peace. The person she recommended I start with was my bio mom.  For a little background info my bio mom left me in my dads driveway when i was 5 and didn't reach out again until I was 18. I also have 2 other siblings a younger brother and younger sister. My mother also gave up my sister. When my mom came back into my life I tried to set rules but she broke everyone. I still wanted it to work so I let it slide when she would bad mouth my dad and step mom, or ghost me for months. We lived in different towns so i only saw her twice in 2 years. A year ago i moved to the same town as her and not once since my move have I seen or heard from her. The only time I have seen her was at a bar and she pretended to not know who i was. Also I received calls from my family asking why i'm ignoring and being rude to my mother. I've tried to reach out multiple times to talk to her and understand what is going on but i never get a response and her family always makes an excuse for her. I finally decided that i need to get these feelings off my chest because it was affecting me mentally. I posted on Facebook where I know she would see it. \n-I'm sorry that Im such a disappointment and that you feel you need to hide me from the people in your life. If sorry that i failed in being the child you wanted. But I am okay . I know i will be okay. I have people who stepped up and took your place. So i guess i should thank you for letting some else give me the love you couldn't find.- \nI didn't tag her and we don't have the same last name. So unless you are close family you wouldn't know what i was talking about because no one outside of my family knows she is my mother. The next morning I woke up to calls and texts saying i was a horrible person for trying to blow up her life and that it was not hard to understand why she wouldn't want me as a daughter.

All of your problems are solved as soon as you learn what it means to set a boundary.  Letting a narcissist cross your boundaries consequence free is an invitation to an unstable drama filled disaster of a life.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
