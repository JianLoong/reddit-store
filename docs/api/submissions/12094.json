{"id": 12094, "submission_id": "11p5qew", "title": "AITA for going no contact after being told I should be dead instead of my brother at my grandfather's funeral?", "selftext": "So I have 4 sets of grandparents (they all divorced and remarried before I was born) Last year my father's mother died and then 6 weeks later my Moms stepdad died. I was at the wake of my grandfather and planned to sleep at my grandmothers to keep her company. At one point my grandmother freaked out and said she was stung by a bee, so being an EMT I stepped up and started to asses her. One family friend starts trying to put a tobacco poultice (from a cigarette and water) on the sting to which I said, no thanks. (because frankly tobacco the original plant may have been helpful but not the dried-out chemicals in my cigarettes. So I bring my gran inside to dress the wound and give her a Benadryl just in case (she is a bit of a hypochondriac but 1 benadryl won't hurt her.) As I have her inside I start to check her med drawer for Albuterol which my grandfather had due to his asthma but also helps with possible allergic reactions, I wanted to be prepared in case she really was allergic. As I am searching the drawer my aunt comes in telling me I was so rude to the family friend and that I should have died instead of my brother because at least he was nice. (my brother died 3 years before this in a car crash). I just ignored her and helped my gran, who was fine. about an hour later my uncle (aunts husband) finds me and tells me I am a monster and how dare I take over for his mother's care instead of his wife. Now I am an EMT and they run a construction business, as far as I have ever known the most they may know is some first aid. I now have gone no contact beyond anything to do with my gran.
