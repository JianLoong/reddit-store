That's our history \n\nI would love to be able to go to my sisters wedding, however with my history it just wouldn't be a good idea without my partner. I respect my sisters wishes and am saddened by the fact that a compromise can't be made between both parties. I hope this clear stuff up, please ask me any questions you want the answer too \n\nP.s.

Maybe your partner could put a bit more effort into finding shoes, but honestly if it would be that hard to find an alternative (given that it\u2019s a question of pain and not preference) I just think an exception should be made.

And then the shoes were a problem. But even if the fianc\u00e9e were to stay at home, negating the shoe problem, OP doesn\u2019t want to attend because of trauma with the brother. OP is looking for a way to get out of the wedding and still be the victim.", "Yeah I really do sympathise with it seeming like you\u2019re just making excuses. It\u2019s a horrible position to be in - I\u2019ve experienced it myself with severe anxiety where my family just could not understand what the problem was and I could not explain it. It made me feel pathetic and so helpless. If that\u2019s the position you\u2019re in then I\u2019m so sorry. \nI\u2019m so glad your parents are supportive. How about your sister? Can you talk to her usually? Do you think she\u2019d listen to you if you tried talking to her again? I imagine she\u2019s pretty stressed with the wedding so I get that it might feel like it\u2019s not worth trying and having her potentially lash out at you, creating an even bigger issue, especially with what you went through with your brother. However it might be worth considering writing a letter or something, possibly with your parents\u2019 input as to how best to communicate. \n\nThis is probably not at all helpful, but I might say something like this: \n\u2018I am so sorry for causing you issues when I know you\u2019ve got loads on your plate. I am seriously considering just not coming bc I feel like it would be easier for everyone, but I don\u2019t want you to think I don\u2019t care, or I don\u2019t want to be there. I really do. I also appreciate the accommodation you\u2019ve already made regarding (partner\u2019s) outfit which makes me believe you want me there, too. \n\nThe thing is, while I really appreciate that you made that exception and would love to show my appreciation by meeting you halfway, it just isn\u2019t possible: I swear to you we have tried to find shoes but just can\u2019t find any that don\u2019t cause my partner serious pain, and I just can\u2019t ask them to be in pain for the sake of appearances. \n\nI know that making another exception leaves you open to questions/requests from other guests, and I get that that adds stress, and it\u2019s not fair and I\u2019m sorry. I understand that it might be too much to ask, and I\u2019m sorry. \n\nMaybe you think I shouldn\u2019t ask at all: that I should just come alone if my partner can\u2019t find shoes. And that\u2019s valid. I really have thought about it. Ultimately though I don\u2019t feel like I can. I\u2019m not strong enough to be around brother by myself. I need support. I need someone there who can tell me I\u2019m not the crazy one. Who loves me, when someone in my family is making it clear that they don\u2019t. I don\u2019t know if this is reasonable. I don\u2019t know if I should be able to suck it up. All I can say is I don\u2019t think it would be right to ask ask my partner to pick up the pieces if I expose myself to something I know will hurt me for the sake of not seeming like the bad guy. \n\nIf you disagree please talk to me. I want to hear how you feel: I want to try and make it work. I want you to know that I love you and want to be there. I really am so sorry if it seems like I\u2019m just make excuses. I hope you can believe that it\u2019s not the case.\u2019", "This doesn\u2019t make any sense OP", "A general dress.code, yes.

Any other shoes cause greater issues, and I'm not spending money on shoes I can't wear. Lots of people have issues which severely limit what they can wear, do, eat, etc., and we learn what are the least painful options for us (because that's often the outcome...the 'least painful option' is the best we can get) and we stick to it.

But they are extremely expensive and it\u2019s a crap shoot whether they\u2019ll be wearable or not. You can easily spend several hundred dollars on a pair of shoes that feel fine in the store, but after wearing them for 1/2 an hour, are unbearable. I\u2019ve personally spent a whack of money I couldn\u2019t afford on orthopaedic shoes that were absolute torture. And considering the number of health and mental health issues the OP discussed, I would imagine money is tight (healthcare costs and employability being what it is when you\u2019re disabled).
