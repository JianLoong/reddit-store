That's our history \n\nI would love to be able to go to my sisters wedding, however with my history it just wouldn't be a good idea without my partner. I respect my sisters wishes and am saddened by the fact that a compromise can't be made between both parties. I hope this clear stuff up, please ask me any questions you want the answer too \n\nP.s.

Maybe your partner could put a bit more effort into finding shoes, but honestly if it would be that hard to find an alternative (given that it\u2019s a question of pain and not preference) I just think an exception should be made.

I appreciate your response, thank you", "Yes, but no. OP's partner doesn't have to reveal her medical file to her SIL, especially if trauma is involved. The sister is acting like an AH.

That turned out to be untrue as she has already made an accommodation. You can't go alone because of trauma and now you are saying it is an issue because your partner can ONLY wear sneakers, which are generally inappropriate wedding wear. My instinct is that you just don't want to go to this wedding and you are looking for reasons to get out of it while framing your sister as a Bridezilla and you as a devoted partner to your GF. You may have good reasons for not wanting to go, but I don't think you are being honest. A less generous view of this situation is that you are making this wedding about you and your issues, but I am not quite leaning towards that yet.", "Then for everyone\u2019s sake, stay home \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Sorry if this sounds rude, but I feel like you've made a decision not to go and are looking for an excuse to give the Bride/Groom.

(hint: it's probably not the latter)", "I don\u2019t for a minute believe the only shoes in existence that OP\u2019s partner can handle wearing are those one pair of sneakers. It feels like just another excuse from OP to get out of going.", "Exactly. First they can\u2019t go because of dresses. Then shoes. Then even if their partner doesn\u2019t go, they can\u2019t go because of the history they have with their own brother. At this point you\u2019re putting the exodus on your partner, or on your sister for not making accommodations, when in reality, you just don\u2019t want to go.

Pretty cheap on places like Amazon, and would be dressy enough under a smart pair of trousers.  Might be a good compromise.", "Wow that's fucked up of your sister.", "I\u2019m thinking that there will not be a bouncer at the door.  She would not be allowed in bridal pictures but I don\u2019t think anyone will cause a scene at a wedding for shoes.

If black tie isn\u2019t optional, people shouldn\u2019t say that it is. If people are THAT badly informal, they don\u2019t have to be in the official photos, but also some photographers offer some photoshopping afterwards to fix anything that doesn\u2019t quite fit. \n\nEven then- saying all women must wear a dress is both overly controlling and misogynistic. Some might even call it ableist as it\u2019s not necessarily the most practical item of clothing for some people.\n\nIf you can\u2019t enforce it in a workplace because it\u2019s clearly discriminatory, you shouldn\u2019t attempt to enforce it at private events either. \n\nOverarching all of this is my opinion that if the aesthetic of the wedding is more important to you than everyone having a good day, your priorities are wrong.", "True in the US, too", "In an edit, OP said that the sister is fine with trousers, but now their partner can only wear sneakers so that\u2019s causing an issue. \n\nSounds like there\u2019s a lot we aren\u2019t hearing.", "This is going to permanent mar your relationship with your sister. People have suggested tons of solutions and you haven\u2019t even entertained any of them. Your brother was mean to you so you can\u2019t be in the same room as him. Your partner can\u2019t wear dresses, or shoes other than sneakers so she can\u2019t go. Wheelchairs not an option. Orthopedic shoes not an option. Bring a different plus one maybe? My guess is not an option. You aren\u2019t going because you don\u2019t want to, so just own it.", "Then talk it out with your sister. Stop fixating on the details stopping you and ask her genuine advice on how you can cope.\n\nAnd not going to her wedding may ensure her not being at yours, it imho most likely will if you don\u2019t talk to her. Stop asking her to accommodate moving targets. Ask her how you can manage, maybe attend the ceremony and photos but and not the reception. She can seat you separate from your brother if there\u2019s a meal etc. It\u2019s up to you to accommodate the situation and be there for her.\n\nAlso, autistic does not mean you\u2019d just say it necessarily.", "Then YOU go!", "Wrong.

The bones in my feet became brittle and through multiple fractures my arches fell. For some people any kind of decorative footwear (and remember high heels are an aesthetic choice not a functional one) is painful.

I imagine OP's sister feels much like you then. \n\nBut as someone who can't really flex her toes on one foot, I haven't got a sodding clue what I would wear to a winter wedding as the only shoes I have been able to wear for the past 4 years are trainers, walking boots or structured flip flops like the fitflop brand.  I have a wardrobe full of amazing heels that I can no longer physically get my foot into. It's depressing af.  So I can sympathise with OP's partner from afar, although I think I would be able to find *something* to wear,  but then again mine isn't a chronic pain condition, just degenerative.", "that kind of inability to be without the partner tho is a red flag for codependency.", "Before the updates, I would\u2019ve said N T A.

What possible reason would the sister have for \"females must wear dresses\" in the same breath as \"smart casual\".

As I've mentioned previously, I love my sister and I'd love to go, but I've stated the reason why it's not possible.", "This is a really helpful comment. I am sure there are a lot of people (especially older ladies) who do not want to sacrifice all of their style because of physical ailments.", "It's not ableism. I just googled women's shoes for Charcot foot and it took me to an online store that have shoes just for that condition (one that I am so sorry you had to deal with. It sounds terrible.) There are non-sneaker options. Maybe those didn't work for you or maybe they didn't exist then--I am NOT questioning your experience or condition, but they are there now. Further, OP's partner does not have a condition like Charcot foot, and she certainly doesn't have an issue like having a prosthetic. Maybe those shoes won't work for her either, but it sounds like something OP isn't even willing to try.", "And even if by miracle, they find a pair of dress shoes that can work with her condition, how much are they gonna cost? \n\nOdds are they'll be somewhere between pricey and an arm and a leg. \n\nHow much are partner and OP supposed to invest to be worthy of being guests at this wedding?\n\nWho's even gonna look at the footwear of a random guest?", "There's a wide gap between stilettos and runners.", "If you really wanted to go you would go instead of trying to find excuses not to.", "It's not the outcome, you're deciding not to go without your partner and your partner is deciding that wearing her sneakers is more important than being there. What if your partner and you were not together or she were unable to attend due to work? Would you just not go to your sister's wedding? It sounds like you're leveraging this to try and force your sister into OKing your girlfriend showing up dressed inappropriately. No one thinks wearing running shoes qualifies as anything close to formal enough for a wedding with a dress code. Your sister isn't being unaccomidating, you're going out of your way to find excuses. I wouldn't expect your sister to come to your wedding.", "It is common. But 15 years ago you were very limited but orthopedic shoes are much more fashionable, and orthotics are often as good as orthopedic shoes.", "There are some very nice looking orthopedic shoes out there.", "Yah, it\u2019s great to support each other, but sounds like that\u2019s being done in lieu of properly addressing the underlying issue.", "Yeah, I'm leaning more and more into thinking OP is TA. The wedding is at a restaurant. It seems like a relatively small event, and (I'm betting) sister just wants OP's partner to be dressed nicely because she is trying to include her as a family member to be in pictures. Because it is at a restaurant, OP's partner will be able to sit down for almost the entire event. I guarantee there are other shoes out there that she can wear. It's just another excuse. I know this is kind of cruel, but I'm almost waiting for the edit that says OP cannot afford these other shoes. Then sister will offer to pay. This will trigger some other form of trauma and we can just keep going.", "I was gonna say, I'm pretty sure even a lot of white tie events are not gonna throw you out so long as you're wearing a white tie level outfit. \n\nLook at the red carpet these days.", "Re: the running shoes. \n\nIt all depends on what the running shoes look like. OP says they're on the smarter end of that spectrum. I have a pair of black leather sneakers that used to double as my nice shoes. From 10 feet, they can pass for dress shoes. Not that I was really trying to pass them off as dress shoes. \n\nSneakers are like jeans. A plain dark, clean pair is appropriate for business casual, and outside of weddings, a lot of people don't need to dress more formal than that.", "We don't get out much \ud83e\udd23", "A different pair of orthopedic shoes would allow your partner to dress up to other future formal events. For example, YOUR WEDDING. \n\nBringing a different plus one would solve the shoe issue and allow you to attend a very important day in support of your sister, who you say you love.

Being honest works for people like me but doesn\u2019t work for whiny people who have to play the victim and look for ways for everything to be someone else\u2019s fault.", "There is not another pair of shoes on the planet that she can wear? You said in another comment she can wear orthopedic shoes, you just don't want to buy them. So not buying a pair of shoes or being at the event without your girlfriend is too much effort to go to your sister's wedding, who is supposedly important to you? If someone told me that they're not coming to my wedding because their girlfriend can't be bothered to get a pair of shoes that aren't runners I would know they obviously just didn't want you go and didn't even try very hard to come up with a good excuse. Add in the fact that you went out of your way to get engaged right after she did, and it seems very much like you're just trying to create issues.", "She's absolutely within her right too, no dress code, it's outdated and uncomfortable", "I don't think that's fair. I do think that OP really doesn't want to go because of their brother but doesn't want to admit it.", "Yes, sorry I forgot that everybody has the cash to splash on a pair of orthopaedic shoes, she's also not my girlfriend she is my fiance, I've said that please use the correct term, your mindset confuses me.", "Everyone? No. Someone who only owns one pair of sneakers and who gets invited to a formal event that they want to even kind of pretend is important? Yes. I took a 14 hour flight and a week off work to attend my sister's wedding because she's important to me and I wanted to be there for her. You won't even purchase an acceptable pair of shoes or go without your fiance for a few hours. That's why everyone is saying that it's very clear you just don't want to go. Your sister will know that she's not important to you. You already proposed directly after she got engaged, now you're coming up with (honestly ridiculous) excuses not to go to her wedding. Is this maybe a jealousy thing between you two?"]}
