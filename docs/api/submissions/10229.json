That's our history \n\nI would love to be able to go to my sisters wedding, however with my history it just wouldn't be a good idea without my partner. I respect my sisters wishes and am saddened by the fact that a compromise can't be made between both parties. I hope this clear stuff up, please ask me any questions you want the answer too \n\nP.s.

Maybe your partner could put a bit more effort into finding shoes, but honestly if it would be that hard to find an alternative (given that it\u2019s a question of pain and not preference) I just think an exception should be made.

All I can say is I don\u2019t think it would be right to ask ask my partner to pick up the pieces if I expose myself to something I know will hurt me for the sake of not seeming like the bad guy. \n\nIf you disagree please talk to me.
