I've been living with my partner and her 9 year old child for just over a year now. We both have a car and she is an extremely anxious driver so right now unless it's good conditions outside, we rely on me to do all of the driving. 6 weeks ago I started a new job that pays a lot more money and we're planning on my partner cutting her hours down (and I will pay for the majority of the bills etc so she won't be struggling for money and will have fun money). We're thinking of doing that in January once all the Christmas spending is out of the way.  \nLast night my partner asks if I can take her son to school and her to her work in the morning. His school is about 5 min drive away (with no traffic) and her work is 2 mins away from that (again with no traffic). With the school/work rush traffic we're probably talking a 20-30 min round trip. It takes about 20-30 mins to walk, max. I said yes however the only caveat is that we leave absolutely no later than 8:30 as I start work at 9 (work from home on Mondays) and I'm not signing on late due to it being a new job and still being on my probation. I said that if it got to 8:30 I could order (and pay for) a taxi for them. She agreed.  \nCut to this morning, it's 8:35 and neither of them are ready, she asks if I can take her and I say no because it's too late and offer to order a taxi for her. She says no, raises her voice and says \"I'm just asking you for a fucking favour and you're doing nothing to help.\" Then storms out of the bedroom.  \nShe ends up getting her dad to take them (he only lives around the corner). And now I'm getting the silent treatment.  \n\nI feel like I've given enough relevant info but just ask if I haven't and I'll fill in the gaps.  \n\nSo, AITA? Do I need to get some flowers and chocolates and make sure dinner's ready on the table for when she gets home?", "created_utc": 1670839689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjunx1/aita_for_not_taking_my_partners_kid_to_school_and/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And so far her way is very immature.", "I mean in general. Why are they not walking daily. Not just in this particular situation. Something worth exploring.", "NTA. \n\nNo chocolates or flowers, in fact you should be waiting for an apology when she gets home. Here is what to lay out when she gets home:\n\n1. You did offer to do her a favor, but had terms of a time frame in order to do the favor. She couldn't get it together in time, and that's on her, not you. You didn't say no because you were lazy, you said no because you have a JOB that starts at 9, and she knew that. \n2. She says you are doing nothing to help- so all the other times you drive her mean nothing? All the other things you do mean nothing?\n3. Does she not care about your job or your schedule? \n\nAfter laying those things out, see what she says. If she says \"I had a shit morning and the world was against me, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have taken it out on you\" then all set! You clarify that you are happy to give her a ride but by X time, and that you will let her know when your schedule doesn't allow for you to give her a ride at other times (like an early meeting). \n\nBut if she comes home still thinking you are wrong, well you have a problem. This woman wants you to drive her around when it suits her, but also wants you to be the breadwinner. I wouldn't offer her any financial support- especially when it makes her dependent on you- if her attitude is that you should be available to drive her when she wants and she will go for low blows (you never help) when she doesn't get her way.", "Nta\n\nYou did nothing wrong, so you don't need to apologize for anything. You said you could give a ride up to a certain time, she chose to not be ready. \n\nAlso, so what if she's an anxious driver, her child needed to go to school, and she needed to go to work, she can pull up her big girl pants and do what other adults that don't want to drive do everyday, and drive.", "NTA \n\nI have major issues with your partner on this. Her behavior is entitled and immature, and the silent treatment is a whole issue in itself. \n\nIs this normal for her?", "NTA  I am getting a whiff of entitlement.

She was late and like you said, you being late in probation won\u2019t look great. You\u2019ve been more than fair.", "NTA", "NTA  She made an agreement that sounds spelled out to me.  You have a new job and need to keep up a good impression and being late to sign in from home is not a good impression. What is wrong with a taxi?  But now that you know her dad can take her, that should be the plan going forward.", "NTA. Don\u2019t marry this person.", "She's needy.  What grown ass woman can't drive 5 minutes away.

That can complicate time management but does NOT absolve us from the responsibility of it.  We know we are responsible for ensuring we get to things on time. I\u2019ve worked that out years ago but my daughter is still working on it.  \n\nIt is not fair to put that responsibility onto anyone else.  I also would be wary of letting her cut back on her hours and putting the bulk of earning responsibilities on you if she\u2019s going to react like this to reasonable expectations on your part.  \n\nGood luck dude.  You\u2019re going to need it if you have to come up with fancy dinners to apologize for a situation you did NOT cause.", "Info what did you do in the morning to help? You talk a good game about how soon she can cut her hours but that morning she had to get ready for work and get the kid ready for school and she asked you in advance to help drive. Now I certainly understand the time boundaries and how important it is to be at your new job on time and the offer of the taxi if they couldn\u2019t make it seems very nice, but did you help them try to make the timeline? Or did you sit around drinking coffee while she hunted for kids shoes, waiting for her to fail because that\u2019s easier?", "NTA, she's hella inconsiderate", "No flowers. No chocolate. No you.  This relationship is on life support.  Cut the ties now.", "NTA 100%. I don't think OP should even bring up the option of her being nearly completely financially dependent on you.  This is already an incredibly unhealthy reaction to a reasonable request that you've had of her.", "That's a very fair question. Honestly, nothing. HOWEVER I do feel like it needs a little elaboration. He's a good kid and he is able to get himself ready in the mornings (this one included). He needs some prodding (hurry up we have x mins until we need to leave) but other than that he can sort himself out. I feel like I had a part in that as he wasn't able to tie his shoes or his tie etc when I first moved in but he can do both now every time (I'm pretty proud of him and that!)\nThis conversation with my partner happened before either of us had left the bedroom and she wasn't dressed when this went down.", "Or she could walk.  It's not far.  OP, is this typical behavior?  You're only a year in, you might want to take a long, hard look at things since this may be her true nature showing through.", "I mean, a 30 minute walk is fine. She could have walked", ">I don't think OP should even bring up the option of her being nearly completely financially dependent on you. \n\nVery much this. OP, you're being set up to be drained financially **and** emotionally. NTA but you need counseling a financial planner or a life coach to help you sketch out the facts about how you're being used here.", "I wouldn't call 2h of walking daily (both ways am, both ways pm) a particularly practical thing.", "Why both ways? She can go to work and it\u2019s on the way to her kids thing."]}
