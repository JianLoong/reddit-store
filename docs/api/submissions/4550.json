I've been living with my partner and her 9 year old child for just over a year now. We both have a car and she is an extremely anxious driver so right now unless it's good conditions outside, we rely on me to do all of the driving. 6 weeks ago I started a new job that pays a lot more money and we're planning on my partner cutting her hours down (and I will pay for the majority of the bills etc so she won't be struggling for money and will have fun money). We're thinking of doing that in January once all the Christmas spending is out of the way.  \nLast night my partner asks if I can take her son to school and her to her work in the morning. His school is about 5 min drive away (with no traffic) and her work is 2 mins away from that (again with no traffic). With the school/work rush traffic we're probably talking a 20-30 min round trip. It takes about 20-30 mins to walk, max. I said yes however the only caveat is that we leave absolutely no later than 8:30 as I start work at 9 (work from home on Mondays) and I'm not signing on late due to it being a new job and still being on my probation. I said that if it got to 8:30 I could order (and pay for) a taxi for them. She agreed.  \nCut to this morning, it's 8:35 and neither of them are ready, she asks if I can take her and I say no because it's too late and offer to order a taxi for her. She says no, raises her voice and says \"I'm just asking you for a fucking favour and you're doing nothing to help.\" Then storms out of the bedroom.  \nShe ends up getting her dad to take them (he only lives around the corner). And now I'm getting the silent treatment.  \n\nI feel like I've given enough relevant info but just ask if I haven't and I'll fill in the gaps.  \n\nSo, AITA? Do I need to get some flowers and chocolates and make sure dinner's ready on the table for when she gets home?", "created_utc": 1670839689, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zjunx1/aita_for_not_taking_my_partners_kid_to_school_and/", "score": 82, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You were going to do her a favour but she broke her side of the deal. She was late. You were even going to call a taxi so it wasn't like you were going to leave her stranded. As it is your probation period, it is important to arrive on time considering you are relying on this job to allow her to work less hours. \n\nShe needs to learn some responsibility and time management", "NTA you were very clear with your timing and you offered her a solution to her being late.", "NTA. Your stipulation was clear, and it wasn\u2019t for selfish or non existent reasons.  You have a new job, which benefits the entire household, and will eventually even allow her to work less.  You can\u2019t be late.   \n\nShe CAN drive them both\u2026..she\u2019s choosing not to, and decides everyone else needs to cart them around; they can also walk.\n\nSo, she storms out and says you\u2019re doing nothing to help\u2026.time to rethink how much you\u2019re being used here in likely MANY aspects of this relationship. The fact that you\u2019re asking us in your last sentence if you think you need to bring her flowers and grovel makes me seriously wonder how often this kind of crap goes on", "So no one is concerned that she starts cursing at him when she doesn\u2019t get her way?  In January you are letting her take a step back from her job so you will be taking her child daily. Oh honey I don\u2019t work today why should I get dressed ?  Your life is about to get a lot harder. You two need to talk", "NTA \n\nOP is acting responsibly, trying to hold down a job, and not getting fired.  Partner is asking for a favor and ignoring OPs very real deadlines to be at work on time.\n\nWhy should OP be the one to apologize?  Partner sounds immature and entitled.", "NTA - she asked you for a favour and you agreed so long as you wasn't made late. She broke that by making you late so it's then her responsibility to deal with the situation. Simples", "NTA but you're still going to be in the doghouse on this one even though she agreed to your deadlines for leaving the house", "NTA and don't let her be more dependant on you (working less hours). Her child is her responsability. You're trying to do her a favor and she's not acting like an adult. At your place I would reconsider \"helping\"/paying her too much.", "NTA. Consider if you need to stay in a relationship with an adult that is so immature.", "NTA\n\nSo she will work less, you will pay more bills, and you get to cart around both her and her child at her leisure and she gets to throw tantrums? She\u2019s got it made in the shade.\n\nYou might be driving, but you\u2019re being taken for a ride.", "NTA. She agreed toyour stipulation. Not your problem.", "NTA, unless I am missing something.\n\nIt seems you communicated the situation clearly to her and she agreed upon the parameters of you driving her and the kid.  Good luck with everything and do let us know what happens.", "Nta. And don't have her go less in working hours either. She needs to learn how to , manage time,  her son, and be an adult and communicate.  Hold her accountable.", "NTA This is a major red flag though, does she blame you for her failings often?", "NTA \n\n\nWhat did she do before you moved in? Did you drive from wherever you lived to pick them up and drive them?\n\nHow do they get home?", "Nta. You made a deal you give her a ride or you order a taxi. She wasn\u2019t ready a 8:30 so you leave and get a taxi. She is just the AH.", "NTA, if you want someone to do you a favour, then it's literally the bare minimum to be on time, ESPECIALLY since you're on probation at your new job.\n\nShe *agreed* to taking a taxi in case she was late. I genuinely see 0 way she is logically justifying this to herself tbh.", "NTA she is the parent. You should really reconsider if stay at home is best.", "NTA\n\nYou did try, you laid it out for her and all she had to do was be on time.  She was not.  She also didn't want to take the cab you offered to pay for.  Nope not even a little bit TA.  \n\nIf she's still upset, remind her about the timing and that you're on probation at your job and exactly what you offered the night prior.  You did everything you could to help, but you're not risking your job to take her to work.  That's extremely unfair to you, especially considering your job is what's going to give her more free time in the future.", "Nta. Do not apologize. You did nothing wrong. You set clear and reasonable boundaries - and she stomped right past them. Not wanting to be late for work is completely reasonable. \n\nIt's fine if she doesn't want to drive. But as an adult it is up to her to figure out how to get where she needs to go. As a parent it's on her to figure out how to get her child where the child needs to go.", "How was she getting herself to work and her kid to school before you lived there? She needs to go back to that. \n\nAnd then she flipped out and was yelling\u2014in front of the kid as well?\n\nShe sounds awesome. /s\n\nNTA", "NTA. Instead of appeasing her, you should be asking her for an apology. You might need to rethink the relationship if she doesn't give you one.", "NTA.

You bouth agreed at one specific time, she cannot doit in that time and she said no to the second option that was the taxy.", "NTA, but does she always resort to that behavior when she doesn't get her way?

Time to tell her that you only have competent drivers in your life.  That can be her, or it can not.

That they're on probation and can't start late? They did that.\n\nCommunication is important but every time there's a problem the solution isn't always \"you both need to communicate\".

Sure, OP should try again but if their partner doesn't respect their time and schedule over their own convenience talking isn't going to fix it.", "I didn't ask, I assume it's because it's cold (0-1c) and possibly because by the time they were ready they'd be late if they walked.", "I am of the old school, one fail  doesnt mean you give up, you try at least  3 times before you say  F it.   \n\n\nSo no need for him  to bring chocolate or flowers. They need to sit down again and communicate and  list boundaries and understand each point of view.  Listen to each other is  key.   He said  8.30,  she  most likely is person who thinks it means 8.30- 8.40 then she needs to communicate this and just not think he can read her mind.  He has set his boundaries clear again.   \n\nRight now she is trying to punish him with withholding  communications  and if he  goes in with flowers and chocolate,  she has  won and rule  from now will be  she doesnt need to mind his boundaries. \n\nHe doesn't  want  that,  they need to act like mature adult and try to solve this  by words.   And so far her way is very immature.", "I mean in general. Why are they not walking daily. Not just in this particular situation. Something worth exploring."]}
