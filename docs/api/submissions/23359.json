Don't force pets of any kind on your parents and always ask permission. If your dad had already said no, then again, no is no and don't do it anyway. Your dad didn't need to and shouldn't have gone ballistic. He should have calmly given a timeframe in which you had to remove the tank from the home. Calling the police was reasonable on your end but your dad being forced into a situation where he has to allow you to have unwanted animals in the home is not.", "ESH. Your father sounds volatile, why even bring pets into an unsafe living situation like that?", "Nta holy crap good thing you called the police.

He'll kill off the rest of them when you're not around. It's not safe to have pets in that environment. He's abusive and dangerous", "ESH. You should have asked permission before setting something like this into his house/apartment. He has every right to refuse them. Also fish tanks do take a decent amount of electric. Filter system, heater, air pump, lighting, plus anything else the fish could require.
