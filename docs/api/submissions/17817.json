Does your husband work?", "NAH, because he's grieving but you need to have life keep rolling forward to provide for your family and give him that space.\n\nI saw you mentioned your family and friends live elsewhere; would setting up a Zoom or Discord call with your husband and them work out, perhaps? I live on the other side of the world to my family and to many of my friends. My partner and I currently even keep in touch through hours long Discord calls. It helps make the distance less, and helps keep our moods up when we can't hang out IRL.", "Thank you for your kind reply.
