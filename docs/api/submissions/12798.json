For example, on our wedding day my father in law asked me if I had been practicing my moves for the wedding night and if I needed any advice (I was appalled). I have told my wife before that sometimes her family can be too rowdy for me, but she gets defensive and says I should accept her family for who they are.

At least I\u2019d imagine it\u2019s normal to have a thorough understanding of the family you would marry into even if that understanding is to avoid them\u2026. Obviously people can\u2019t predict the future but grown adults typically have some form of structure and stability in life if they\u2019ve raised kids already.

I\u2019m not saying she\u2019s right and he\u2019s wrong though. I think they\u2019re both right and need to compromise and communicate. \nShe seems to like her family and is okay with their style of communicating so I\u2019d think it\u2019s perhaps reasonable to assume that she\u2019d be the type of person who may regret not having a husband who also has family oriented values.

I\u2019m not saying never go but she should be comprising with you. \n\nEx. 1) tell her you\u2019ll go on vacation but you\u2019re getting you\u2019re own hotel room and if she has a problem with that you\u2019re not going at all\n2) join her for the birthday parties but tell her you\u2019re only staying 4 hours max and if she tries to force you to stay by keeping the keys you\u2019ll be ubering home. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have lied so you\u2019re kinda a ah but not nearly as much as your wife.
