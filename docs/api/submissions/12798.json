They yell to communicate, get drunk together often, have no respect for each others privacy, and ask very invasive questions. For example, on our wedding day my father in law asked me if I had been practicing my moves for the wedding night and if I needed any advice (I was appalled). I have told my wife before that sometimes her family can be too rowdy for me, but she gets defensive and says I should accept her family for who they are. There have been times when I\u2019ve asked my wife if I can skip family reunions and birthday parties but she gets very mad at me and says it would be super rude to avoid her family. \n\nSo when I found out that my out of state work trip was the same week as the family vacation, I decided to fib to my wife a bit. I told my wife that my work trip was 4 days long and that it wouldn\u2019t make sense for me to travel to the air bnb to stay for only one day. My wife agreed to this. So, I went on the work trip and enjoyed a few days of peace and quiet at our house while my wife enjoyed the vacation with her family. \n\nA few weeks go by and I\u2019m having some coworkers over for drinks.
