Throwaway account.\n\nSo it was my birthday a couple of days ago and this situation just left me with a bit of a sour taste in my mouth so I am definitely posting here wanting to get some perspective.\n\nFor context, my bf struggles with some deep rooted insecurity and jealousy issues. We have both addressed this and are trying our best to work through this. He also does not have a job.\n\nOkay, so on my birthday he got me these gorgeous stud earrings. They were absolutely beautiful and fit very well into my aesthetic. However, they were too large to wear on a daily basis and that I would switch and wear those for special events and occasions. Everything was great. I loved my gift and made it very clear that I liked them.\n\nNow this is where it gets a little odd in my opinion. I had given him some money as a goodbye gift a monthish before (we are in a LDR) so he could buy himself something nice. After I opened his gift he made a little comment saying \"*I used the money you gave me to buy these for you.\"*, I thanked him and moved on. Then a couple minutes later he starts saying the following things:\n\n*\"I spent a lot of money on those so you better not lose them.\"*\n\n*\"I swear if you lose those..\"*\n\n*\"You better take care of those, they were really expensive\"*\n\n*\"You know I don't like spending money on people, so you know you mean a lot to me if I did this\"*\n\nIdk, definitely felt super uncomfortable but I just moved on.\n\nThen later that night at my birthday dinner, my two bestest friends got me a pair of some really expensive designer sunglasses. I was so excited and shared this with my bf and this is the part that left me feeling somewhat upset.\n\nInstead of being excited for me he started going on about how now he feels bad that he can't spend that much money on me and that he's sorry he can't do that for me. How he wish he had friends like that. He then asked me how much they were (which I had to look up) and I was even shocked at the price, he then started questioning me about why they would spend that much money on some glasses. It got worse to the point where it turned into an argument about why I didn't make an instagram story post showing off his gift (I didn't even post the glasses) and accused me of being embarrassed by him and his gift and embarrassed of being in a relationship with him. \n\nI ignored all of it and just tried to move on. I feel upset by this but I can totally understand what he's trying to say and where these feelings are coming from. I didn't say anything and just explained myself but now I feel like TA.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680998484, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12g2sqx/aita_for_ignoring_my_boyfriend_for_making/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Best of luck!", "Wait, he spent YOUR MONEY on a gift for you. He can\u2019t even be arsed to spend his own money on you and then starts bitching about it. Good grief, honey, this guy is a schmuck. NTA.", "NTA him having insecurities and jealousy issues are issues HE needs to be working on while you can only be supportive. He doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019s working on them from all these comments and sounds like he needs to work on these issues before he\u2019s in a relationship.", "NTA, your boyfriend seems to be obnoxious and toxic", "Why are you with an unemployed guy who you give money to? Plus he's annoying and needy. Maybe you like feeling like you have the upper hand. NTA, but if he stays unemployed and you are still his gf, then you will be.", "NTA. He sounds like an exhausting red flag who wants all attention on himself.", "NTA.  He didn\u2019t buy you a gift.  You bought you a gift.  All he did was choose the gift you bought for yourself.", "NTA How exactly are you working on his jealousy issues? He acted all up about the earrings he bought with YOUR money: \"I don't like to spend money on people so you are special because I bought you something expensive\" HE DIDN'T SPENT HIS MONEY\n\nHe then scolded you with the you better don't loose them and blahblahblah, and you ignored his behavior, the behavior that made you feel super uncomfortable. It made you feel like that because that's what he wanted.\n\nThen he made the other gift all about himself, played the victim \"oh poor me I'm sure you are ashamed of being with someone like me bleehhh\" and again you ignored his behavior. AGAIN. Having \"issues\" is not an excuse to be an AH. We all have issues and we work on them or lose people. He is not working on anything, just said it upfront so he can later say that he told you he was like that and that he's sorry and working on it, the usual narc act. Also, you should not be working in his issues unless you are his therapist, you can support him and what would really help him is you standing your ground and expressing when he acts like an AH and walking away when needed.\n\nLDR sucks and most of the times are not worth it.

He told you he used the money you gave him to buy the gift and then also said he spent a lot of money on you...I guess sort of? Since it's his money after you gifted it to him. But why? To guilt you?

You did your part to make sure he knew you liked them. The rest is on him. I would warn you that this is a red flag in a partner.
