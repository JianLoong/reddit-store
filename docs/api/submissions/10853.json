I actually ended up in a conversation with George Takei because he shared it. He apologized publicly, but the picture had already reached all of his followers and been shared by many of them.", "This post belongs on r/entitledparents lmao", "Oh I'm so sorry about what you're dealing with! I only use mine when either I have shooting pains bad enough to cause a fall or numbness. I know the more I use it the more I'll need it. My condition is Ehlers-Danlos so I have to keep my muscles strong. My doctor and I discussed that when he prescribed it.", "Yeah. I have idiopathic polyneuropathy for the last 9 years. It's an autoimmune also. I haven't had your luck, mine was always progressing in worsening the symptoms. I can't feel my feet, legs, and the fingers in my hands are starting to feel numb. The neuropathic pain I endure is beyond anything I ever knew possibly, my nerves are too damaged. From early 2022 it became obvious that I no longer had the ability to walk more than 20 meters. With much effort and with my walking aid. Meanwhile other medical issues arise, syncope trigger by heat and stress, and 2 more. It is what it is but it still breaks my heart. I loved my life prior to this disease.", "Oh I'm so sorry! Mine isn't bad even half the time, thankfully, but my condition has caused me to be wheelchair bound twice for multiple months. The first I had a really bad fall and all the bones below my knee basically spread out. I didn't have insurance so couldn't get the medical care I needed, just an ER visit where every specialist in the city made some excuse to come see me because it's really rare to do that to both legs at the same time. Plus they couldn't believe if walked in, given the pain. The second time I slipped my L4/L5 and couldn't use my right leg for a couple months. We had to go without surgery because it would just mean I was more likely to move the issue higher. (Ehlers-Danlos)\n\nIf you don't mind my asking, what condition are you dealing with? It sounds like it really sucks for you.", "OP and her kid had to stand because the wheelchair was occupying the wheelchair spot and other people were already sitting in the other seats.  I hope this helps you :)", "What's unreasonable about wanting to sit with your child?", "You thought there would be more support for your ableism? You\u2019re delusional", "Really? Lol. Maybe you should be counting your blessings that you can stand at all, unlike the poor chap you harassed.", "Seems like people on reddit like to stick with the popular opinion... Quite disappointing to see no intellectual points of argument being presented.", "It\u2019s alright! It\u2019s called CMT. It\u2019s a degenerative nerve disease", "This doesn't show why OP and her child HAS to stand for no reason?", "It\u2019s not unreasonable wanting to sit with your child. What is unreasonable is that OP was expecting the only person on the bus in a wheelchair to move from their designated safe spot so she could sit with her child. Why not ask an able-bodied person if they could have moved, if it\u2019s that much of a problem? Or was it because OP thought it would be easier to pick on the disabled person? Either way she\u2019s still TA! And you sound like one too!", "What is unreasonable is not her goal (sit with daughter), but the way she wanted to achieve that goal (move a wheelchair user out of the designated wheelchair spot).", "How is this ableism? OP only wants to sit with their child. You are missing the point.", "How does this relate to the post at all?", "1hr old account with a similar username hahaha OP made a burner account to agree with themselves. YTA on both of your accounts", "It's very 'one note' the criticism.  The couple comments I read were the same!", "Oh wow, I'm so sorry you're dealing with that. Do any medications help? I was on gabapentin for a little bit. It helped with the pain but made me manic so... Not all that useful for my nerve pain!", "Because you're acting surprised that you're not getting support for being obtuse and entitled? Because instead of thinking \"uh oh this guy needs space for what are essentially his legs, better make room\", you thought \"but my perfectly working legs are tiiiiiiired!\"  Wah wah.", "Excuse me? Is that what you think of me? I would never.", "Busses are designed with wheelchair space in mind; there are specific locations they have to be. They cannot simply \u201cmove to another part of the bus\u201d. That\u2019s not how that works; there is only one wheelchair-designed spot on a bus. Idk where you live, but in the US they legally have priority and are protected under law to be there.", "So multiple people had a similar thought about your behavior, so you take that to mean....They're all wrong?  Lol you obviously did not come here to actually learn or receive education on this at all. You just wanted to be told that you are right and got upset when people called you out for your bad behavior.", "Yeah because we can all clearly identify what\u2019s wrong here, its pretty straightforward, YTA", "Yeah... If they're going to disagree they should at least have a range of different reasons why. I'm seeing a lot of people simply calling you nasty names without any justification! A bunch of uncivilized people who shouldn't be allowed on the internet in my opinion.", "You are deliberately ignoring my point. The disabled person in question can simply move elsewhere and allow OP to sit with their child.", "But wheelchairs were designed with mobility for the disabled in mind? They could just navigate themselves to another spot so that OP can sit with their child.", "Stop attacking the OP without any reasoning...", "People are attacking my character, my ability to parent, one post doesnt make a person!", "That's not how disabled seating works on buses. What us wrong with you?", "Why can't OP find another spot", "There\u2019s only one space for wheelchairs. One space that has belts, or is out of the way.\n\nTell me you\u2019ve never ridden the bus without telling me you\u2019ve never ridden the bus", "What other spot, the roof?", "As I said, busses are designed with *one wheelchair accessible space in mind*. They could not go to another spot. Are you really this dense?", "*\n\n>\tBut wheelchairs were designed with mobility for the disabled in mind? They could just navigate themselves to another spot so that OP can sit with their child.\n\n*have you been on a bus?  I suggest that you go on a bus. Take a good look around. How many spaces are there for wheelchairs? Why are they called \u201cspaces for wheelchairs \u201c?  So\u2026\u2026 the only place for the wheelchair using person, other than the space specifically dedicated for wheelchair users is off the bus.", ">\tPeople are attacking my character, my ability to parent, one post doesnt make a person!\n\nThis one post shows an awful lot about your character though, an awful lot.\n\nWhy do you think the man was in a wheelchair? Do you believe the man to be in a wheelchair for fun?  The man in the wheelchair was in the safe and correct spot for him. Yet, you wanted the wheelchair to move. To move where exactly? Off the bus? Out of your life? \n\nPeople are annoyed at your inability to comprehend what you did, nor how extraordinarily thoughtless you were. Even now you appear not to believe that you did something wrong.\n\nA disabled person has a right to utilise public transport, just the same rights that you have. You have a massive advantage in being able to stand and to be able to walk.\n\nYour character is lacking for what you dared to do, for your inability to comprehend what you did being wrong, and for your inability to think logically.", "Oh dear. If you can't handle a dissenting opinion and being called out for being entitled and rude, perhaps don't post about being entitled and rude? The world does not revolve around you because you procreated.", "You searched through all of the comments identifying you as an AH to find one awful person to agree with you.\nThis and your post tells us a lot\n\n1. You are selfish and entitled, expecting a wheelchair user to move out of their seat instead of you just moving down the bus. \n\n2. You completely lack empathy \n\n3. You are deluded to think people would agree with you and clearly  lack the ability to perceive reality \n\n4. Instead of accepting the obvious fact that you are wrong, you are doubling down and searching for anyway to justify your disgusting behaviour \n\n5. You are clearly rather unintelligent for the a bove reasons and because you could figure out the obvious solutions to your problem on the bus\n\nAll off the above adds up to a terrible parent whose child will need years of therapy", "Well they can simply navigate themselves to another spot that is suitable, and allow OP to sit with their child.", "Another spot on the bus, or are you being intentionally brainless?", "Why would they only have one? Sounds like you're making up facts for the sake of the argument.", "How is their character lacking? They are trying to care for their child, and that shows compassion. The person in the wheelchair on the other hand feels like they're entitled to a spot when they could simply move and allow OP to sit with their child.", "Why don't you stick to being a sheeple instead of attacking OP's character?", "What a list of horrible assumptions. This was the first comment I saw when I came back, I'm reading through the other comments now.", "Why are you making so many assumptions from simply one post where they're being dogpiled for no reason? You sound like a very unlikeable person. I wish you good luck in your social endeavours as it seems like you'll need it."]}
