And that their needs as parents, and the children\u2019s needs, supersede others. \n\nA complete stranger does not have to give way to a parent and child, because the mother is tired and wants to sit.

This is especially true if the complete stranger is more entitled to the space than you are\u2026 ie) in a wheelchair. Wheelchairs are not easy to move on bus\u2019s, and there are limits to where they can safely fit.\n\nThe simple solution was the child sits, and you stand.

It was sheer laziness that you did not want to do this. \n\nThere are limited areas in a bus where a mobility device can fit. And typically these are in designated areas. Of which the person in the wheelchair is entitled to first.

I believe you should try seeing what the other comments are trying to point out so here\u2019s my honest take.\n\nThis is my unbiased judgement, you were a bit unreasonable here because your five year old can sit in your lap or you could have stood up while your child sat. Maybe you didn\u2019t think of that at the moment but I hope next time you do because it\u2019s already a struggle living with a disability so doing extra for someone could have done these other options is pretty rude. \nI do agree with your friends it made you seem insensitive and ableist.

And that's JUST my garage, I have a bunch more everywhere around my house. when I can walk unaided, fantastic! That's what I call a A++ day. But any long distance or if I know I'm going to hurt at the end of the day, I have to bring something. (Usually a cane 9times out of 10, my walker on rough days, my wheelchair when desperate) And depending on my spoons at the start of the day... I might progress to stronger aids throughout the day leaving some extras in my mom's car, or I'll just say f it and ask someone if they could please push me in a wheelchair, though that's really rare because even on my worst days I don't want to be a burden, but know I can't keep up rolling myself along.\n\nThe only thing I wish is that older people (I'm talking 70's+) would stop judging me for it. I went to Kennedy space center with my sister and her kids, I had my cane as I knew it was a lot of walking ... And the looks, glares, and snide comments that I kept getting, all from the older generation, was disheartening.... And if another person tells me to wait till I'm their age.... Honey... I'd either be lucky to live that long... Or I'll be a whole lot worse than you and WANT to be dead \ud83e\udd26\n\nEdited: forgot part of a sentence & typo", "Also the United States.

If you\u2019ve been asked \u201cdo you want to press charges\u201d by a cop in the U it\u2019s States what they are really asking you is \u201cAre you going to cooperate as a witness if we charge this person,\u201d or \u201care you going to make this a problem for us if we don\u2019t arrest this person.\u201d", "The person has said they didn't press charges because they didn't want to pursue it.", "Oh I'm so glad you're improving!
