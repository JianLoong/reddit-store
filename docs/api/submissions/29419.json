Tell this to your brother. Even in the best of cases his wife is suffering from a chronic inability to read the room and she needs to cut it out because she's coming across as being deliberately hurtful and hateful. \n\nIf she actually is just making hateful digs under the guise of \"joking\" then failing her having an epiphany that she is the bad guy here, there's nothing to be done except standing your ground and reiterating to your brother that you aren't going to subject your wife to his wife's broken-record enmity. \n\nIf your brother keeps insisting it's all just joking, tell him that even genuine jokes can wear out their welcome after constant repetition and become grating and his wife's comments weren't funny to begin with. At this point her intention doesn't matter as they must know that these \"jokes\" are coming across as attacks and are destroying relationships.
