We\u2019d go to parties together and he introduced me to a lot of people. One of the people he introduced me to was this girl who I was instantly very interested in. We didn\u2019t talk that much, but she just intrigued me. I found her Instagram and from that the coffee shop that she worked at so I started going there and sometimes talking to her (but mostly just hanging out). I did this for a few months and I had developed a pretty good rapport with this girl\n\nAbout a month ago when I was hanging out in our dorm my roommate texted me and asked if he could have the room for an hour or so. This happened pretty often and I was fine with it. Then when I came back to the room he was with my dream girl. I was fighting back tears and my face turned red, so I just ran out before they noticed.\n\nI had mentioned how much I liked that girl to my roommate, and he seemed not to care at all. I was so angry I did something I regret a little. Our university (BYU) is very religious and has rules against premarital sex on campus. I reported my roommate and the girl, she got sanctioned and he was removed from school (for repeat offenses). \n\nI know some people might think this was too far, but all students at the school agreed to live by the rules and he broke them time and time gain. He was obviously super mad at me and basically all our friends (including the girl I liked) excommunicated me from any activities. \n\nIMO I stood by the rules and principals I we agreed too, and while I probably wouldn\u2019t have done it had I known he was going to get kicked out of school, I don\u2019t think I was in the wrong.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1676836161, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/116m45x/aita_for_getting_my_roommate_kicked_out_of_college/", "score": 70, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
