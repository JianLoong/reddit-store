It was my first time going, as we would typically go to my family\u2019s house instead. \n\nI got a (rather pricey) gift for my fianc\u00e9 \u201cDan\u201d related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for \u201cDan\u2019s\u201d parents based off of things I\u2019d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan\u2019s other relatives (I didn\u2019t know them that well). \n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting many gifts from Dan\u2019s relative\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know many of them that well, but I was certainly expecting more than I got. \n\nAt first, I was excited when I saw that there was a big pile of gifts for me. However, once I opened the first one it was just a piece of coal. Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them. \n\nI started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it\u2019s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don\u2019t have to stress over finding a gift, and it\u2019s a fun experience for the newcomer as well. \n\nI told Dan I couldn\u2019t believe I skipped my own family\u2019s celebration for this and left. But now Dan and some of his family are blowing up my phone saying I embarrassed him in front of his relatives and that I made it awkward for everyone.

It was my first time going, as we would typically go to my family\u2019s house instead. \n\nI got a (rather pricey) gift for my fianc\u00e9 \u201cDan\u201d related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for \u201cDan\u2019s\u201d parents based off of things I\u2019d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan\u2019s other relatives (I didn\u2019t know them that well). \n\nI wasn\u2019t expecting many gifts from Dan\u2019s relative\u2019s because I didn\u2019t know many of them that well, but I was certainly expecting more than I got. \n\nAt first, I was excited when I saw that there was a big pile of gifts for me. However, once I opened the first one it was just a piece of coal. Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them. \n\nI started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it\u2019s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don\u2019t have to stress over finding a gift, and it\u2019s a fun experience for the newcomer as well. \n\nI told Dan I couldn\u2019t believe I skipped my own family\u2019s celebration for this and left. But now Dan and some of his family are blowing up my phone saying I embarrassed him in front of his relatives and that I made it awkward for everyone.
