It's not a place for *anyone*:  Man, woman, or child.  It drives down the value of property, public transport is unsafe, crime is infamously high, drugs are openly sold on the streets like you're at a flea market, needles litter the streets and local parks, people who care carry Narcan (from librarians to cops), and it only gets worse if left unchecked, never better, while also being a blight in your community/neighborhood, and certainly isn't good for those who already live closer to the encampment (as well as for those who call it home).  Write to your mayor, council people, the police non-emergency line (unless it escalates), whatever you have to do.  It may do good, it may not, depending on how your city treats such things.

And I think a lot of the \"no fucks\" homeless people are that way because jail is the only chance they'll have at 3 hots and a cot so they don't care. I know there are a few times I said that to myself while stealing canned ravioli from Walmart.", "I'm only asking to get a sense of your background since I find a lot of people in these types of conversations that have very little actual experience with it. I agree that the best way to reduce the homeless population is to attack the root causes with free access to quality mental health and social services that are actually funded and drug treatment programs for those who need it. More low cost housing will help with the 40% who are employed and still unhoused. We should also be funneling defense spending away from private sector contractors and towards the VA to get the homeless vets the help they need. But the drug stigma exists because it is rampant and very visible in the homeless encampments described. And the fact of the matter is, that there would be fewer people who had negative views on them if these areas weren't routinely trashed and dangerous to people passing by. OP's concerns in this context are valid as it poses a safety risk to her. If the bike path wasn't obstructed it would be different.", "What is degradation is that they have to be in this situation. What's degrading is reporting individuals for just existing. What's degrading is that entitled individuals think it's okay to make life worse for them because they are homeless. That's what's degrading. Have a good one tho.", "Here\u2019s where the privilege comment is apt. Perhaps you\u2019re just being disingenuous. People \u201chaving a tent\u201d is a far, far cry from what a lot of us deal with. If that was the case, put up all the tents. Ain\u2019t gonna bother me.", "Nice of you. Would you change your tune if the camp literally blocked the entrance to your building and filled it with stench, your loved ones were assaulted with bodily fluid, and your public facilities were unusable? Just consider the ADA implications alone. \n\nI don\u2019t think that expecting a reasonable degree of safety in your own home is too far out of line. It sure doesn\u2019t make someone an AH.", "Drive, in a car, where you are protected and unobstructed. With the homeless behind a building and not blocking your path home on a bike, with no protection. See the difference here? If they were not in the bike path and making the ride home unsafe, we wouldn't be having this conversation. It's easy to make a detour in your car, not always so much on a bike.", "Seems we are simpatico here; thanks for the dialogue.", "That is a lot of an attempt to justify bad behavior.  However, you have a good night as well.", "What are you even talking about. Do you think if someone (read - cops) show up to the encampment by OP they\u2019re going to just get rid of drug paraphrenalia and leave the tents alone?\n\nAnyway I\u2019m done replying. It\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve had some really bad experiences with homeless people and that sucks, but that doesn\u2019t mean every situation is like yours.", "OP isn\u2019t describing the entrance to their building, they\u2019re describing an encampment under an overpass. Where are you getting this from??", "Until recently, I took public transit very often too. No barrier between me and the homeless people at the bus stops and train stations. But I never felt the need to call the cops on them just for existing.", "I'm not justifying bad behavior. Im pointing out the lack of empathy. Something that you and opp seem to lack. Sleep tight and don't let the homeless bite. \u263a\ufe0f", "I\u2019m describing my own experience to make my point. Regardless, OP sure does have the right to unobstructed travel. Would you change your tune if they were in a wheelchair?", "One or two on a public train or bus is different than a small woman on a bike passing through an obstructed path under a bridge at night. Are you a small woman?", "Demands for empathy are excessive and exhausting.", "I have no doubt that OP being a small woman puts her in more danger in that situation. I\u2019m sure biking alone at night around a bunch of high people under a bridge is very scary. Though she never mentions the homeless people interacting with or antagonizing her at all. But also - OP can just\u2026 not be there. I really doubt there are zero other ways she can go to work.\n \nIf the options are ruining the lives of dozens of people who already are in a bad state, or finding a different way to work, I\u2019d hope most compassionate people would choose the latter. That\u2019s my final stance, you can keep coming up with reasons for why it\u2019s ok to call the cops on encampments under overpasses."]}
