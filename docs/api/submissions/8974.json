Staying somewhere for a month doesn't really do anything to paint the vanlife community in a better light IMO, and makes things more difficult for the people trying to do it", "Exactly. Like park at Walmart for a few days in a row if need be, not a month in front of someone\u2019s home.", "They might have a composting toilet; they\u2019re pretty common in van life. Waste just goes in any trash can.", "I agree, but if you take where I live as an example (semi detached house in an English city) both of my neighbours\u2019 houses are closer to mine than the road is. I can hear the tv of the person next door, and muffled conversations when he\u2019s on the phone. They can see me when I sit in the garden. Doesn\u2019t sound too different to the situation described by the OP, except that my little slice of suburbia would cost over \u00a3250,000 to buy. \nGiven the state of the economy, the cost of housing and the precarious nature of some folk\u2019s employment we are only going to see more of this, as people are priced out of having a house. \nHaving said all that, it\u2019s bad form to stay right outside someone\u2019s house - and very poor etiquette to do so for a month.", "I don\u2019t think we are assuming be is a bad person. We are asserting that we cannot know, and it\u2019s likely foolish to approach them since they could be armed or target your family afterwards. Maybe it\u2019s a 10% risk but with my wife and kid living right there? 10% is too high.", "The sex offender thing is what I\u2019m concerned about as well. If someone lives in your neighborhood you can check the registry and have their name and address. This random van guy living in front of your house touches your child and then leaves, what do you know about him?", "Dude just move your van a block every day. That\u2019s all he\u2019s asking for.", "There's at least one street in NYC that's full of vanlifers. I still can't figure out how they get away with it.", "The person living in their car is way more at risk than the person who lives in a house", "My point is that those concerns wouldn't be raised if he had moved into a nearby house.", "Oh, so they weren\u2019t there for a month?", "He\u2019s likely stealing your wifi too lol.", "Same here.  If someone is visiting a friend, that would explain why they feel so comfortable staying a while.", "I\u2019d say the people living in the other houses on my street have stronger ties to and a more vested interest in the community than someone parked out front in a van. This is especially true of those who own their homes, but it generally applies to renters as well.\n\nI don\u2019t have a strong opinion about OP\u2019s situation either way, but I think it\u2019s disingenuous to claim that he\u2019s just another neighbor like all the others.", "Uh yeah because you know where he lives and know his name and can verify he is safe. I always check when someone new moves in. Search their public court record for criminal cases too.", "I didn't day STATE I said BLM or Federal.  Keep trying.", "Compositing toilets of some kind are very common in vans. The ones with a larger power available can use incinerator toilets although that's not recommended. Working can be seasonal jobs, telework, running a virtual business, online tutoring, social media presence.", "Very easy to setup enough solar and batteries to power a 4/5G wifi router and some other stuff in a van. For heat you can get diesel heaters.", "It seems a lot more likely than some random dude just setting up camp in a culdesac. \n\nLiving out of cars is typically frowned upon by local law enforcement, and a suburb full of SAHMs is the last place you want to be if you want to avoid negative attention.", "Well that escalated quickly", "u can't do that.  OP doesn't own the street.", "https://vanlifecustoms.com/vans-for-sale", "Actually a lot of them are older or disabled and on a fixed income. When the price of real estate shot up they found out it was cheaper to upgrade a van into decent living quarters than to rent. My dad and stepmom travel in an RV to avoid the winter where they live, and meet a lot of van dwellers. But those types aren't posting everywhere about how cool it is, because it's not a life they chose.", "So sad and depressing now - I used to LOVE Portland", "I lived on a sailboat for many years. I was both considered \u201chomeless\u201d in a traditional \u201cno way to get mail delivered\u201d sense as well as transient by the USPS. I did get a PO Box, using the harbor as my \u201cphysical\u201d address\u2026but still, a PO Box didn\u2019t mean I wasn\u2019t homeless.", "Sorry, they\u2019re homeless. You could live in a cardboard box and say technically you aren\u2019t homeless because the box is your \u201chome.\u201d", "Without Judgement on the original Topic:  \nThis is a very bad analogy. Living in a van parked on a street is a choice. Being LGBT isn't. That alone is enough to dismiss your analogy."]}
