I did a bit of research to identify some resources, places the guy could go, then I went and had a very courteous and respectful talk with the guy.  He had a story about being down on his luck, the couple lost their jobs then home.  Whether it was true or not, I have no idea but that didn't really matter to me.  I politely but firmly told him he wasn't welcome where he was parked and the neighbors were becoming more and more alarmed over his presence.  I offered some suggestions where he could go based on my limited research, let him use my hose to fill the water tank in his RV, gave him a jump and after he thanked me for the assist, I watched him drive away.  I would recommend you approach him with compassion recommending solutions.
