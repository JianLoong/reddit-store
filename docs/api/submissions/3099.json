However, since my husband has a transferable job we could not stay for more than a month as he had to join the new location. So, naturally I moved in with him after a few weeks. My husband told his mother to get a maid since he was going to pay her to help me around the house. But the weeks I stayed they never got one and his mother was very rude towards me. My husband would often go to the head office of his company nearby his home during day time to finish off some pending work and that would make me live alone with my in-laws most of the time of the day. He returns only at around 9 pm at night. From the first day, I had to sweep, mop, wash utensils and clothes. Which I did quietly that too in a 6bhk house. Then after working when I wanted to take a hot shower cos I live in a hill station, she would often turn the hot water off in the middle of my bath. Also whenever I buy or cook snacks for the entire family she would hide them inside her bedroom and won\u2019t even let me eat it. Once my parents brought snacks and i asked them to bring a kind I specially loved to eat as a child, but I didnt even get a piece to eat cos she would hide them. And then during two of the religious ceremonies too they didnt get any extra help and I had to do everything from washing to moping to serving the guests. Also often times when my husband returns and would be alone even for a second, she would advice him to control me. When my husband\u2019s sister visited us, my husband heard his mother bad mouthing about me to her. Luckily i moved to a new location with my husband.  Even after all this I tried to maintain a cordial relationship with her . On most weekends I visit them with food and stuff. So this one time, during a festival I informed them that since its a holiday and we are family, i will prepare all the food and we will have dinner together in their place. I cooked for them that whole day. Since they are my husband\u2019s parents, i didnot want to break them apart. However when I was serving the food that night, his parents without even prior tasting them started complaining that the food doesn\u2019t look good and all. My husband was there and he got so pissed off that he told them \u201cthis is why no one visits you both. You dont know any manners. When one cooks good food you should not complain\u201d. And tbh I am a good cook. Even my husband loves my food. We ate food silently that night and left. Two weeks later there was a religious ceremony and they invited us too. But my husband told them that he is not sending me and he cant go because he has work. Now they hates me for turning their son against them. Although I didnt do a thing and I didnt have to, since, he saw himself how much I have tried . Am I wrong for not attending the event ?", "created_utc": 1669261169, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z39aka/aita_for_not_caring_to_bond_with_my_mil_after_she/", "score": 30, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

What does it matter what they think of you or that they believe you turned him against them? It\u2019s not like they thought kindly of you before anyway. They just don\u2019t want to admit they themselves are the problem. Let them scapegoat you. Doesn\u2019t matter. No contact is the best possible scenario here anyway. I\u2019d have an honest convo about this with your husband about it and have him have one with them too. However that goes is what will dictate their relationship. Either they\u2019ll see the light and be better, or they\u2019ll push him away more and he\u2019ll see the light to cut them off and out.", "Obviously NTA.

You cannot control how other people act. You need to act in a way that is true to you. And while the cultural tradition of living with your in laws sounds unpleasant to me, you did your best to be a good houseguest. You were true to your cultural traditions and the type of person you want to be. But you can only be treated so poorly for a limited amount of time. You gave them a chance. But they didn't respect the tradition by treating you badly. They created this dynamic and they need to face the consequences. They ruined your relationship.
