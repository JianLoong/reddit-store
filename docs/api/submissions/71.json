In 2017 I began working at this daycare then I left in 2019 to become a nanny. Recently, I decided to start working at the daycare in the afternoons to bring in some more income for my up and coming move. I started in august and work from 3:45-6:45 everyday. \n\nWhen I was rehired at this daycare, they told me I\u2019d be with the after school students because their current teacher (40f) wanted to change her schedule and no longer wanted to teach them. They told me that the class was mine and to do what I want with it. \n\nFast forward to two weeks ago and one of my students had a birthday party, her mother (who works at the center)  brought juice and whatnot and told me to keep whatever was left. In my classroom there is a large storage cabinet with some stuff from the previous teacher and some of my things for the class. I put the left over party stuff in the cabinet and was going to use it at a later time. Last Wednesday I decided to give my students a movie day with popcorn and the left over juice from the birthday party. I asked one of my students to grab the juice from the cabinet because I was setting up the popcorn and movie. \n\nLast Friday, I came into my classroom and all my stuff I had put in the storage cabinet was sitting on my desk. I went to put it back in the storage cabinet and saw that the previous teacher left a note that said \u201cdo NOT touch anything in MY cabinet! -Ms. ___\u201d I was like what in the world is she talking about? So I went to her and I asked and she told me that I had been stealing stuff from her cabinet and that I shouldn\u2019t touch things that aren\u2019t mine. Apparently the mom of the girl who\u2019s birthday party we had, took her juice back, so the one the student grabbed was actually the previous teachers juice she had bought for summer camp last summer. I told her it was an honest mistake, apologized, and told her I would buy her a new one. She said \u201cyeah you better.\u201d \n\nI come into work today and everything in my classroom has been rearranged, seating chart has been moved, and all the things I had on the walls were taken off. I asked my director who did it and she told me the previous teacher was in my class taking some of her things to bring to her classroom but she didn\u2019t know she was messing with my stuff. Then one of my coworkers said that the previous teacher is going around calling me a thief and she touched all my stuff so I can \u201csee how it feels.\u201d I looked in the storage cabinet thinking that it would be cleared out as well so I \u201cdidn\u2019t steal\u201d anymore of her stuff. It wasn\u2019t. So i did it for her. I emptied out her stuff from the storage cabinet, put it on her desk, and put my stuff in the cabinet that\u2019s in MY classroom. Mind you, each classroom has one storage cabinet so technically she\u2019s using two and leaving me without one. I felt really confident in my decision to move her stuff but now I\u2019m feeling like the asshole. What do you think?

Sounds like this other teacher is out of her freakin mind and has not developed mature communication skills. \nIf her things are so important to her (and if she wanted to behave like an adult), she \nwould have made it clear to you when you started what you were allowed to use and what was off limits because she plans on using it in the future. The least she could have done is label her items clearly so that there would be no confusion.\nHer little \u201cpay back\u201d of rearranging your classroom is also incredibly immature. \n\nPutting her stuff on her desk is not necessarily the best thing for you to have done but she\u2019s still way more of an asshole than you. \n\nHow long do you intend on working at this place? I would cut the passive aggressive crap and have a real conversation with her; set some boundaries and let her know that unspoken rules are not going to fly, and that that cabinet is yours. If this convo doesn\u2019t go well, start talking to your boss.", "She did already. The woman didn\u2019t believe her.", "NTA. Loop the director in on EVERYTHING, including that you emptied her stuff out of the cabinet. She sounds like someone who will keep escalating things, so get your director up to speed ASAP."]}
