Why is everyone these days so incompetent when it comes to understanding basic infection theory? Her son\u2019s cold most likely DID have a causal effect. \n\nThat said, how did an infant\u2019s cold escalate so quickly? Was the infant not taken to the doctor?", "Yeah the 8 year old had no say in whether he went to his dad's sick, and isn't going to comprehend the dangers of exposing an infant to a cold. That's all on the adults. And, ya know, not taking an infant with a fever to the doctor.", "Yeah, could very well be the case. I'm just saying that the way OP frames it, it wasn't she was just trying to figure out why her daughter died, it was \"she was saying stupid things\" so I think there's a difference. OP could very well just be phrasing it that way.", "If there isn\u2019t a custody order in place, she should have kept her son away from the newborn knowing he was sick. It\u2019s common knowledge babies immune systems aren\u2019t great. The son isn\u2019t to blame here but the adults in this situation suck", "Looking out for your child doesn't involve telling a grieving mom that it was their fault for not taking the baby to the hospital sooner.", "I had a colleague who purposely sends her sick child to preschool so that the teachers can tend to the kid. Her exact words were \"I make it the teachers' problem\".\n\nA heavily pregnant friend and I visited this colleague for lunch. Her kid had the flu and was contaminating just about everything. The parents didn't do anything to prevent it.\n\nThe very next day, my friend and I fell ill. My friend was in her 8th month of pregnancy, so you can imagine the stress; she couldn't take any medication.  I went from a flu to a chest infection that lasted for weeks. That was my last time setting foot in this colleague's home. \n\nThe reddit crowd will come at me with pitchforks for saying this, but I will say it... If the OP and her husband KNOWINGLY introduced / exposed their ill kid to a newborn baby whose immune system hasn't developed, both deserve a massive YTA.", "My daughter is 6. Her father lives alone and I still ask him if he wants her to visit while she\u2019s sick. I let him make the call", "people are not overlooking this, it's mentioned in so many comments", "It absolutely was on OP to say her child was sick and can\u2019t visit. I highly, HIGHLY doubt her son would have had a meltdown for being \u201cchecks notes* sick. Stepmom is wrong in placing her blame. It\u2019s entirely on the parents who allowed this. They both suck.", "All I asked was had the father been informed. I never made a judgement.", "No, I would protect the child from a mentally deranged stepmother.  I get it, she lost  a child, that is awful.  But the son needs to be protected.", "This is second hand information.... just have a conversation with the ex. It\u2019s his son too that\u2019s potentially being talked about.", "No one even knows if this is accurate information. It\u2019s all second hand. Why wouldn\u2019t OP speak with ex first. It is also his son. Let him speak to his wife if it\u2019s true.", "She didn't take it out of the 8yo. She made a completely logical statement NOT to the 8yo, that the cold probably came from his visit. Which is true. Unless they were taking the baby out of the home, or one of the parents came home sick, the 8yo was probably the source of the infection.", "Doesn't sound like she's taking it out on him, and she stated she doesn't blame him. She's just telling folks what happened, which is 8yo was sent over with a cold and baby got sick from it.", "> I told her if she wanted to tell the full story she should mention how she never took her newborn to the hospital knowing she had a fever for days.\n\nright there in the origional post", "Sounds like she did but by the time she went the \"cold\" had developed into pneumonia and progressed", "OP says stepmom didn't take the baby to hospital after having fever for number of days", "Well considering the baby had a fever for days and wasn't taken to the hospital or a doctor to get it checked out, I think it's safe to say they didn't get the baby checked out either until it was too late or at all.", "Well, if she wasn't dumping on OP's son, OP wouldn't have had to air the full context of what happened.\n\nAny fever in a newborn needs immediate attention.  One call to the pediatrician would have told them that. If they let the baby have a fever for days, that's negligent. They are at fault. \n\nThey are the adults they are the parents.  Dumping on a boy who just had a cold and who goes where adults tell him is wrong.", "Except it was her fault that she didn't take the baby to a doctor when it was sick.", "If they have a court ordered custody agreement, she actually can\u2019t just decide to cancel a visit. We have no idea whether the father knew about the cold or not, and she definitely should have told him, but then it would be the father\u2019s responsibility to request the change.", "I don't think you get it if you consider a grieving woman mentally deranged.\n\nAlso as mentioned it was never said in front or around the son, so what protection is needed", "why confront the ex when she is able to confront the one spreading this around? she's probably going to speak to him if she hasn't already. but when you have an opportunity to confront the person causing a problem you usually take it.", "nobody ever knows if anything in this sub is accurate. we judge based off what information we're given in the post. there is no use in bringing up the possibility this isn't the whole truth.", "Yeah the parents are pretty terrible and it is ultimately their responsibility that their child is healthy. I just don't think OP was very tactful or kind to a grieving woman. If OP knew her son was sick and sent him anyways then that was also careless. \n\nAll the adults did some asshole things hence ESH", "I mean the woman is married to OP's ex, she's not the only parent who \"didn't take the baby to a doctor\"", "You don't typically take a child to hospital when they're sick. The hospital is more disgusting and dangerous than anything.", "You really believe that OP couldn\u2019t have said that he can\u2019t visit because he\u2019s going to the doctor. You really think that with an actual note from the doctor to prove that he went, OP would be in trouble with family court? With a newborn in the house? Come on!", "He could very easily overhear. People are likely treating him differently.", "It his son too! Shouldn\u2019t someone find out if wife is in fact \u201cimplying\u201d this to family? Or is she just saying the kid had a cold. Which he did. Perhaps the family who is gossiping about it is twisting all this....", "But no one knows if wife is \u201cimplying\u201d anything. Maybe she\u2019s saying the kid had a cold (true) & family members are twisting this. \n\nWhy Not Talk To Kid\u2019s Dad First!", "Seems to be the only one blaming her stepson though.", "Newborns that spike a fever MUST go to the hospital because it\u2019s life-threatening.", "Pediatricians exist outside the hospital, and newborns with fevers need to be seen by them.", "Fever in a newborn under 8 weeks is an emergency and needs to be seen right away.", "This doesn\u2019t apply to newborn infants as they quickly deteriorate and usually by the time a symptom is noticed it is critical. Especially under 3 months. Babies have basically no immune system so they are better off going to a doctor who can provide help, as opposed to older patients who can avoid hospital and give it a day or two to see if their own immune system kicks in.", "Plenty of blame to go around. Very constructive way of dealing with a tragic situation /s", "Not where I live, you need a referral to a Ped, takes a couple months to get in. A family doctor is an option that also will take at least 2 weeks, especially if it's for cold symptoms."]}
