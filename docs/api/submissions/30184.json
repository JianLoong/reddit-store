The neighbors were moving away, and they planned to take the cat, but changed their mind at the last minute.\n\nAs soon as they said they weren't taking him, my husband and I whisked him to the vet, microchipped him, and brought him in for good. His open sore healed in a week.\n\nThe family who brought him into the neighborhood moved away a few months later and NEVER looked for him. And they KNEW he came to our house all the time.", "Keep the cat inside. NTA", "To add to this, it\u2019s pretty clear they don\u2019t care about the cat.   Side post:   my cat adopted me in college almost the exact same way- LSS I prepared for battle and the neighbors were like \u201coh, yeah, we found out she\u2019s female and we didn\u2019t want to spay her so\u2026.\u201d they were letting \u201cnature\u201d take its course- abandoning her.    The vet didn\u2019t think she\u2019d live, but she sucked up the attention and responded to the antibiotics and became a happily ever after indoor cat, who growled at the neighbor every time she spied him out the window.  She knew who was safe to go to, this cat does too.", "While i mostly agree with you\n\nFinders keeper with pets is just so wrong\n\nMy friends cats are outdoors cause they cant be socialised\nNoone should just walk by, see a cat and grab it like its an object wtf", "OP^^^ seriously, this", "Better for everyone", "My brother's tomcat moved to another house three blocks away. He  found it, asked the person about it, and the person agreed that he could take the cat home.  Two weeks, the cat disappeared again.  He went right back to the other house.  It had something my brother's house didn't have.  A female cat.", "Then you\u2019re a shitty pet owner. \n\nSo tired of cats going around freely massacring our native animals because dipshit owners like yourself refuse to keep them inside since \u2018cAtS aRe NoMaDiC, tHeY dO wHaT tHeY wAnT\u2019.\n\nThey do what they want because you refuse to train or control them, they\u2019re perfectly fine living and staying indoors.", "Yeah\n\n\nMy first cat was a kitten that a family friend was allergic to. This kitten was kind of feral, and sadly, I was in college when I had her, meaning her care was mostly in the hands of my mom and step-dad. They didn't want to fight to keep her in. And they kept saying \"'cats just don't get run over by cars.\" Well, she got hit by a car. \n\n\nNot long after, my step dad and I were just hanging out when we noticed this giant swarm of birds doing an almost dance like formation over the trees. We realized that that crazy cat had scared all of them away. Now that she was gone, they felt safe to return", "In *just* the USA alone cats kill 1.3 to 3.7 billion birds and 6.3 to 22.3 billion mammals every year.", "Edited to say: OP NTA and I felt the same way, I was keeping this cat!", "Right?! Just deal with the whining.", "This is the reason my cat has a catio and not open access to the outdoors. He is a killing machine engineered by nature, and he doesn't know the difference between a nuisance and an endangered species. He's gonna kill it all because he's a cat.", "6.3 to 22.3 billion is such a wide range as to be pretty meaningless.  At that estimate, every one of the hundred million cats living in the USA is killing *at least* 63 mammals a day.", "Like you do at feeding time, or when they don't like that it's raining outside, or at 3 am for no reason, or...", "I'd rather my neighbour just keep their cat inside or in a run. Even if the cat isn't in my yard it's still hunting native animals when it's outside.", "I completely agree.
