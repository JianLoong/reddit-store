I was able to get one I made at a pet store that fit our address for our dog.", "NTA - make a post and if the OWNERS don't respond within 72hours, take it to a vet and get it chipped so its officially is yours.", "NTA", "Wanting something  is almost never NTA  . In this case, I see your point!  But unless you keep the cat as an indoor cat, I don\u2019t see how this will work.  Your houses are too close and cat will go back and forth.", "I think you are NTA for wanting to care for the cat. I think YTA for assuming the owners mistreat the cat. My cat has refused to come in the house when it is cold no matter how long I called or chased her. My cat has run off for 3 months and came back (this is over 15 years). A tight collar is an issue but it could have snagged on something. Cats are nomadic and do what they want. If you want to treat the cat like it is yours do so, just understand it will want out and leave sometimes, maybe come back daily or weeks later. Cats more recently have become inside pets where they used to be outside pets. Regardless of what you decide the cat will get out and go where it wants. Share the pet with your neighbor unofficially. BTW tell your girls that cats like to roam and sometimes stay out for days. Be upfront.", "I'd talk with them and ask if they'd be willing to part with the cat, as it doesn't really sound like they give a sh\\*t about it. Otherwise, you'll just be dealing with this endless back and forth. \n\nYWBTA if you just straight up kept it without communicating with them.", "NTA  \n\n\nCheck and see if the cat is chipped. If it isn't, take it to get chipped and then you have a legal point to start from.", "If they\u2019re not looking for it, don\u2019t worry about it. They weren\u2019t even looking for it the first time! Some do gooder brought them the cat back and they obviously  weren\u2019t that concerned bc they let it out again. You could do one of two things. 1. Contact them and explain just what you said here and offer them some money for the cat. I\u2019m 99% sure they rather have the money. 2. Just keep the cat and go get it microchip ped with your contact info", "NTA\n\n\u201cCats do not need to be outside to live a rich and full life\u201d is a hill I will die on.  My cats have lived healthy happy lives and have never set paw outside.  \n\nIf people care about their cats they will not let them roam the neighborhood, potentially getting hurt or causing harm themselves.  \n\nIf the cat came back to you that means it either got out or was more likely let out - and if that\u2019s the case\u2026.I say finders keepers.\n\nAnd please make the cat an indoor cat - keep it healthy and safe.", "The safest thing to do here would be contact your neighbors and tell them that you\u2019d previously found the kitten and tried to locate its owners and failed, and your kids became attached. I\u2019d offer to buy the cat for a small sum, get it in writing, and have the cat microchipped.\nThe adjustment is going to be that this cat is accustomed to going outside, and you\u2019re going to have to be extremely careful to not let the cat out. Providing things the cat likes inside could also help.\nHowever, it\u2019s also pretty obvious that the neighbors don\u2019t look for it, but whoever it is that is posting on nextdoor is going to keep returning to the neighbors. Whatever you do, if you keep this cat, you\u2019re going to have to drastically change everyone in the household\u2019s routine around doors or the cat is going to be continually out and switching houses.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If you let it go back to its owner, the next time you sit it will be dead on the side of the road. Or you can ensure it\u2019s safe. Which do you prefer?", "YTA. A social media post is not sufficient. There could be loads of reasons why someone might not see it. The correct course of action is to call or take it to animal control. Leave your name and number and tell them you are interested in adopting if the owners aren't found or don't pick it up.\n\nThe next time, all it would take is a short walk to go to the owners house and ask them if they would be open to you taking the cat permanently. Wanting to give the cat a good home is fine, but do it the right way.", "NTA but I rescued a street cat on a very cold day and had him chipped and neutered intending for him to be an indoor cat. He was so miserable inside I felt like he was my hostage and not a rescue. We\u2019ve reached an agreement where he\u2019s allowed to live his little life and he always has food and a roof over his head when he wants it, and vet visits against his will.\n\nHe visits lots of ppl in the neighborhood and they know he\u2019s my cat and we text about him. Sometimes he gets \u201crescued\u201d and returned to me by the chip, and once his belly was shaved by ppl looking for a spay tattoo even tho he is clearly a neutered male, which was upsetting but that\u2019s just one risk of allowing a cat outside. \n\nMy point is you may decide the cat is \u201cyours\u201d but he may have different ideas! If he doesn\u2019t adjust to being an inside cat I recommend saying on ND and FB that you\u2019re happy to share responsibility for the cat when it shows up at your door and check to see who is taking responsibility for vet appointments and if no one else is, you will. For me, that\u2019s who \u201cowns\u201d the cat. But street cats know they own themselves.", "NTA could u maybe get an idea of ur neighbours if these people would be open to you buying the car off them? If they say no\u2026 call an animal rescue center (in uk we would say RSPCA but I don\u2019t know if u have that in America) because that cats being neglected", "This is a hard one.\n\nIt is not your cat, so I think you should notify them it is at your place again, but have them come over and get it.\n\nThe next time it comes over, if it does, have it picked up by Animal Control, do not tell anyone that it was picked up as that is not your responsibility to do so, and then see if you can adopt it if the owners do not pick it up.\n\nNTA.", "this is smart, do this OP"]}
