I'll admit I'm not one for them, and find most of them dumb, but our daughter Lucy (5) loves them. They basically do a bunch of stupid pranks to each other, and to be fair Jayden does keep it harmless. Last month we got some realistic looking spider toys with other decorations. Since we got them, Jayden and Lucy have basically taken turns putting them around the house to scare each other or me. I honestly find it annoying but the two of them love it. Lucy does usually get scared, but when she realises what it is she laughs and finds it funny or tells her dad off (it's actually adorable when she tells him off though), and Jayden always pretends he is scared even when she gives it away beforehand by giggling and watching him. \n\nSo about two weeks ago Jayden set it to fall on her when she opened her toybox in the playroom. Lucy didn't open it and apparently he forgot it. Later that week we had my family over including my brother Leon, and my nieces (Tara 3 and Zoe 6) over. Zoe was badly bitten by a spider when she was younger, even had to go to the hospital. Since then she is deathly afraid of them, I would go as far as to call it a phobia. \n\nThe kids went to play and the spiders fell on them. Zoe completely freaked out and just melted down. We came down and saw what happened. Jayden did apologise and try to cheer her up, but Leon was furious. He basically accused us of doing it on purpose, that we should know better and just calling us assholes. We did apologise and explained that it wasn't meant for Zoe, but my brother did not listen to him at all. Leon left early with my SIL and nieces, and the whole night was kind of ruined.\n\nI've tried to talk.to him after, but Leon is still pretty pissed with us. It's been a week and he's still acting like we tried to murder Zoe. I've tried explaining again that it was an accident and mistake. But he basically thinks it's too convenient a mistake, and that if it is Jayden is still an asshole for being so immature and I'm an asshole for defending him. \n\nSo now he basically refuses to see us unless Jayden is banned, which is ridiculous.  I do feel bad that it went so wrong and I understand that it was horrible mistake. But it wasn't meant to happen. It was meant to be for Lucy who likes these stupid pranks. I think Leon's overreacting and he thinks I just don't really care about my niece.", "created_utc": 1668175499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysbg8c/aita_defending_my_husband_after_a_prank_went/", "score": 1454, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does your brother REALLY think that your husband would intentionally go out of his way to terrify a 6 year old child?

You failed to add that at the end. Did she have nightmares back at home? Has she been acting more fearful and upset at home?? Is she emotionally distressed?? Has she been acting out or having accidents??\n\nAlso.. Has your husband talked to Zoe herself and apologized.( Not just the immediate response when it happened.....like an actual conversation)....he was extremely careless in forgetting he set up that prank and frankly needs to own that mess.\n\nBanning your husband seems like an extreme overreaction based on what you wrote. My problem is there isn't enough info on how Zoe has been and is now doing. If she's had ANY struggles because of the forgotten prank--- I can see why the ban is being brought up. He's gone into protective mode for his child. If your guys attitude is too dismissive --- I wouldn't want you to have contact with my child either. It's his fault. Not accepting that, and owning that is a red flag.\n\nEdit to add... Has your husband talked to Leon again and apologized to him and asked about Zoe?? It's only been a week. Leon needs to workout his anger and upset first before moving on. If Zoe suffered in anyway and it's ongoing--- Leon won't let it go. And neither should you.

I feel like that's easily done \n\nAlso I feel like them making that much of a deal out of it probably wouldn't help the kid with thier fear. they can't live thier lives without ever coming across a spider and part of the phobia probably comes from the parents anxiety of her being bitten again.\n\nI think you and you're husband are fine. Your brother and sister in law were probably just upset because thier kid was upset and it triggered memories of the bite. Not that you guys did anything wrong.", "ESH.

It is the responsibility of the prankster to minimize the possibility of a prank hurting someone physically and emotionally and to not involve other people.

You also don\u2019t mention how long the stay was or the chances of it happening again. People who are allergic to spider bites can have huge welts and sores every time they are bitten. I know someone wary of spiders because previous bites have eaten away at muscle tissue. They are not overreacting when they avoid spiders.\n\nYour brother watched his child be hospitalized at a young age. When that happens it\u2019s scary and traumatic for parents as well as children. And it can\u2019t be surprising to you that this was traumatizing. This can\u2019t be the first time you heard they are afraid of and want to avoid spiders.\n\nYour husband really messed up. Your niece may still be dealing with the consequences of what happened, especially if they need to be careful due to allergies.\n\nIt\u2019s only been a week. Give it more time and keep apologizing.

Your brother needs to get over himself. It's a tough one for Zoe bit it wasn't deliberate and your husband apologised immediately and sincerely.

This probably really traumatized his daughter. However, it wasn't intentional. It wasn't meant for her. You apologized and tried to explain the situation. Just give him time to calm down now and hopefully he'll get it after his anxiety for his daughter calms down. And if he doesn't get over it, that's his problem.

It was an accident and you apologized. And your brother should take your niece to a child\u2019s therapist. They can help overcome her fear, bc it might be easier to try and deal with that, than to try to avoid real spiders in all her life. Better ask him to address this matter as soon as possible as long your niece is still young.", "NTA. This is one of those really unfortunate, unintentional things that aren\u2019t really anyone\u2019s fault, but still causes hard feelings. Leon probably felt some anger from seeing his little girl getting a bit traumatized and upset. I don\u2019t know if y\u2019all will ever laugh together about this, but time will help. \n\nI have a young daughter too. We laugh and play and burn each other like old buddies. I also know that it cuts me deep when something has upset or hurt her badly and I couldn\u2019t somehow protect her from it. Like I failed somehow as a father. That I should have been there or done something. It stings and sometimes you start looking for a target to direct that anger and frustration at. Jayden is that target right now but he didn\u2019t really do anything wrong. It just needs time.", "NTA. It was an accident. It's not like Jayden placed spiders around the house just before Leon and your nieces came to your house on purpose. He placed them for Zoe because that's how they play. He forgot about it because in your house that's not a big deal. It's nobody's fault really. I guess that when your husband knows that your nieces are coming, he doesn't put spiders where they can find them", "I think a question here is why does Leon think your family would intentionally try to hurt or be mean to his daughter.

You both need to listen eithout excuses and own that harm was done. Saying you didn't mean it blah blah blah will not help. If you want this to get better you need to find a way to not just say it...but act on it. I don't kmow how to do that as I don't personally know Leon but you do. Write him a message and acknowledge the hurt and fear and ask,what you can both do to heal this.", "NTA your husband and daughter bond by playing pranks with each other IN THEIR OWN HOME.

Your husband is an adult, he should be able to remember where he put things, and the spiders should have been his first thought when he knew Zoe was coming over. If I were Leon, I would never trust bringing my child into your house again. Spiders forced her into a hospital. I agree with Leon, this was a little too convenient of a mistake for you all to have dropped a fake version of the one thing that attacked and harmed this child right on her head. It\u2019s not about whether it was intentional, it\u2019s about just how thoughtless you two were when bringing other people\u2019s children, whose trauma you are clearly aware of, into your home.", "I feel like I need more info: your brother\u2019s reaction seems extreme, which makes me feel like there is more to this story.

He's naturally defensive because it triggered his child's trauma. His demands though are over the top.  You apologized profusely and have explained on repeat that it was not intentional.

I'd give him time to calm down and your husband and daughter should learn this lesson that while they find it funny not everyone does.", "NTA but you're probably only delaying the inevitable if you fix this. People who hate pranks aren't compatible with people who love them, if Lucy enjoys them its arguably better for her not to get too attached to these cousins now.", "YTA or your husband is. Pranks stop being funny after age 6 and any prank that genuinely scares someone is never funny. I don't blame your brother for not wanting to deal with your husband. He has probably been tolerating his immature antics and this, understandably, crossed a line. \n\nThis doesn't sound like your brother over-reacting to one instance but him being upset because he has failed to keep your niece safe from your husband.

They are annoying as hell and often have unintended consequences. OP, you don\u2019t get to police other people\u2019s emotional response to the pranks.

Sounds like he's not all that awesome anyway.", "I'm a bit confused... you're OK with your husband pulling praks on others and him teaching your young child to do the same? And to tell him off? \n\nAnyway, for this situation, even if it seems like an accidental prank, I'm sure it's not the first time. So yep, YTA, because not everyone has your husband's sense of humour. If it was a one time thing, maybe I would be on your corner, but doesn't sound like that.\n\nMy niece was scared of puppies because one jumped on her and scared her when she was learning to walk. Two years down the road, she doesn't trust puppies, but it's perfectly fine with uncle's overprotective German shepherd.\n\n Your niece is not old enough to overcome her fear and nothing about spiders look cute, and your hubby got a \"toy\" that is her worst fear.

Having this relationship of father-daughter is healthy for her.  Also it is something that they can carry into later life. Yes when she gets to be a teenager she may find it annoying.  \n\nLeon, defending his daughter is natural. Especially, after a bad spider bite sent her to the hospital.  Yelling screaming being angry at that time and a few days later is understandable.  What is, not is, saying he has to be banned.  In fact, since this is a father-daughter thing in this logic, she should be banned as well. You should be the only one allowed.  \n\nThat is where Leon has gone too far.

It\u2019s unfortunate that your niece was scared, but it truly was an accident as the prank wasn\u2019t intended for her. \n\nSounds like your niece could benefit from child therapy as her spider ordeal and being in the hospital clearly traumatized her.\n\nYou and your husband tried to apologize, give your brother time and space, if he is reasonable (which he\u2019s not being right now) he will come around.", "NTA. \n\nJees your husband and his daughter are making memories and Leon is demanding it stops because one got forgotten about and his daughter accidently got frightened by it? \n\nI understand that the kids got trauma from it but maybe Leon should be seeking therapy for her instead.

How little does he think of you and your hubby?", "Nta. \n\nI don't agree with all the people saying your brother is overreacting though, phobias are a genuine thing that affect a large portion of the population.

Leon will hopefully calm down soon.", "NTA.  It was unfortunate, but it was meant as fun for your daughter.  It's one thing to apologize (you should) but it's quite another for your brother to insist that you did it intentionally and it's quite another still to say your husband should be \"banned\".

While he is taking it a bit far, I imagine that his daughter needing to go to the hospital over a spider bite must have been scary for all involved.

Ideally, he should have had enough time to calm down and be receptive by now, and he\u2019s TA for escalating to banning your husband from your nieces, but I think the mature thing to do would be to give him some grace. Give him a few weeks and then ask to meet with him in-person, sans husband.

One of them was born on Halloween and she loved everything spooky. We were all broke, but I took her to the dollar tree and said I'd spend $20 on anything she wanted for her birthday, and she picked out twenty different cheap dinky Halloween decorations. One of the things she picked out was this bag of tiny plastic skulls. When we got home we put up all the decorations, and since the skulls were so small they didn't really go anywhere so she just hid them around the house in random places; one on the shower head, one on top of the blinds in the living room, one in a coffee mug, that sort of thing. \n\nThe first time the guys came home and saw them, they were unprepared and screamed. It became a good joke though, where if you found a skull you had to move it and hide it for someone else to find. We played that game for the whole year, moving them around, until we all moved out that summer. I still have two of them in a drawer somewhere.\n\nYour sweet prank story reminded me of this. My friend unfortunately passed away a little over a year ago after losing her battle with depression, so the flashback to this thing that brought her so much joy back then has me sobbing. \n\nI hope you'll cherish these jokes between your loved ones and the happy memories they make.", "Look.

You know what, I'm not going to do that. This whole situation is the example. You and your husband need to understand the amount of damage you've done here. Jayden hurt your niece, brought her face to face with her trauma because he was too irresponsible to remember he set up a prank that would hurt someone who regularly visits your home. An outing for ice cream isn't going to magically fix this. Jayden forced Zoe into a scary situation with her worst fear. \n\nYou and your husband thinking Zoe will just magically get over it is stupid. She won't, it's her biggest fear. Your brother is doing his best to protect his daughter. What's to say your husband won't forget again? How many more spiders did he forget about? How can he trust that something like this won't happen again? \n\nIt's only been a week. You and Jayden both owe your brother, Zoe, and the rest of the people in their home a VERY big apology because they are who have to deal with the fallout from this. Zoe had a meltdown from this and needs time to heal. Just because the two of you don't understand how much this is affecting your niece and her family doesn't make it ok. It makes it worse. That's why I think you two are the As here. You both need to take ownership of what you've done.\n\nMaybe try writing your brother and Zoe apology letters.

I think PTSD is really the case for both parties.", "That's exactly my point. Leon is demonizing Jayden. Leon needs be addressed imo. Again, good on you for supporting your husband. Don't feed into Leon's demands which are not appropriate. If you do, it would reinforce that kind of behavior from him.", "What are the odds of a prank going wrong? Pretty high, actually.\n\nI get that it was a mistake and that you guys have apologized, but something always inevitably goes wrong with escalating pranks and your husband is careless with his pranks, which makes the odds even higher. \n\nI also get that they enjoy the prank, but why does he have the need to rig something up to escalate the prank when it sounds like she is too young to escalate back.

Does Leon think he is going to set up another prank that would scare his children? Or does seeing Jayden somehow trigger Zoe again? Or is Leon just mad and doesn't want to see his face? Or is it just to punish you and Jayden?\n\nIf Jayden had never done anything like this before to your nieces, it's stretching it to think he'd do it again. Especially after seeing how poorly it went this time. \n\nIf seeing Jayden is going to hurt Zoe, you all need to work that out. He hurt her, accidentally yes but she's so young. He'd have to work with your brothers family to figure out how to get Zoe to trust him again, if he could. \n\nIf Leon is just angry or wants to punish Jayden, that's not justified, IMO. Jayden messed up, apologized, and is trying to make it right. There's no indication that this will happen again. The mature thing to do is act like an adult, talk it out, and move on. \n\nAnd Jayden needs to set a clear boundary with Lucy so she doesn't become one of the awful people who assumes everyone finds pranks funny and eventually ruins a birthday or wedding with a horrible prank that no one likes.", "This wasn\u2019t just a hidden spider.
