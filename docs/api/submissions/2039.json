I'll admit I'm not one for them, and find most of them dumb, but our daughter Lucy (5) loves them. They basically do a bunch of stupid pranks to each other, and to be fair Jayden does keep it harmless. Last month we got some realistic looking spider toys with other decorations. Since we got them, Jayden and Lucy have basically taken turns putting them around the house to scare each other or me. I honestly find it annoying but the two of them love it. Lucy does usually get scared, but when she realises what it is she laughs and finds it funny or tells her dad off (it's actually adorable when she tells him off though), and Jayden always pretends he is scared even when she gives it away beforehand by giggling and watching him. \n\nSo about two weeks ago Jayden set it to fall on her when she opened her toybox in the playroom. Lucy didn't open it and apparently he forgot it. Later that week we had my family over including my brother Leon, and my nieces (Tara 3 and Zoe 6) over. Zoe was badly bitten by a spider when she was younger, even had to go to the hospital. Since then she is deathly afraid of them, I would go as far as to call it a phobia. \n\nThe kids went to play and the spiders fell on them. Zoe completely freaked out and just melted down. We came down and saw what happened. Jayden did apologise and try to cheer her up, but Leon was furious. He basically accused us of doing it on purpose, that we should know better and just calling us assholes. We did apologise and explained that it wasn't meant for Zoe, but my brother did not listen to him at all. Leon left early with my SIL and nieces, and the whole night was kind of ruined.\n\nI've tried to talk.to him after, but Leon is still pretty pissed with us. It's been a week and he's still acting like we tried to murder Zoe. I've tried explaining again that it was an accident and mistake. But he basically thinks it's too convenient a mistake, and that if it is Jayden is still an asshole for being so immature and I'm an asshole for defending him. \n\nSo now he basically refuses to see us unless Jayden is banned, which is ridiculous.  I do feel bad that it went so wrong and I understand that it was horrible mistake. But it wasn't meant to happen. It was meant to be for Lucy who likes these stupid pranks. I think Leon's overreacting and he thinks I just don't really care about my niece.", "created_utc": 1668175499, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ysbg8c/aita_defending_my_husband_after_a_prank_went/", "score": 57, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Does your brother REALLY think that your husband would intentionally go out of his way to terrify a 6 year old child?

You failed to add that at the end. Did she have nightmares back at home? Has she been acting more fearful and upset at home?? Is she emotionally distressed?? Has she been acting out or having accidents??\n\nAlso.. Has your husband talked to Zoe herself and apologized.( Not just the immediate response when it happened.....like an actual conversation)....he was extremely careless in forgetting he set up that prank and frankly needs to own that mess.\n\nBanning your husband seems like an extreme overreaction based on what you wrote. My problem is there isn't enough info on how Zoe has been and is now doing. If she's had ANY struggles because of the forgotten prank--- I can see why the ban is being brought up. He's gone into protective mode for his child. If your guys attitude is too dismissive --- I wouldn't want you to have contact with my child either. It's his fault. Not accepting that, and owning that is a red flag.\n\nEdit to add... Has your husband talked to Leon again and apologized to him and asked about Zoe?? It's only been a week. Leon needs to workout his anger and upset first before moving on. If Zoe suffered in anyway and it's ongoing--- Leon won't let it go. And neither should you.

I assume he felt bad for her from the text, but that doesn't mean she wasn't an unfortunate victim and he isn't an A for negligently allowing that to happen.\n\nYour brother is also overreacting at this point. Banning your husband forever over an accident is too far, but maybe it does make sense for them to not come over for a bit until Zoe is comfortable again.", "INFO: has your husband attempted a genuine, legitimate apology like going out of his way to contact your brothers family and speak like adults and owning up to his fuck-up?

I feel like that's easily done \n\nAlso I feel like them making that much of a deal out of it probably wouldn't help the kid with thier fear. they can't live thier lives without ever coming across a spider and part of the phobia probably comes from the parents anxiety of her being bitten again.\n\nI think you and you're husband are fine. Your brother and sister in law were probably just upset because thier kid was upset and it triggered memories of the bite. Not that you guys did anything wrong.", "ESH.  He is justifiably upset as I am sure it wasn\u2019t easy for him seeing his daughter in the hospital.  He experienced his own trauma during that period.  This is t just about the kids, his wound was torn open too.  What is missing from the story is any attempt to validate his feelings.  Have you approached it through his experience at all?  Told him you completely empathize with where he is coming from?  Apologized in any way?  Has Jayden tried to talk with him at all?  Give it some time and have a grown up conversation without getting defensive and see what happens.", "ESH\n\nYou know she's legitimately terrified of spiders. And for months you've been hiding spiders to te\u0155idy people.

Granted, in my case, that\u2019s more because the level of coincidence required for this to be completely unintentional and non-malicious makes the whole thing sound like a creative writing exercise.

Pranks are for stupid childish assholes.", "YTA, pranks automatically make you an ass", "YTA.\n\nA huge part of pranking is not forgetting about your pranks. It is the responsibility of the prankster to minimize the possibility of a prank hurting someone physically and emotionally and to not involve other people. He can\u2019t leave pranks in perpetuity.\n\nYour niece was badly injured by a spider. Having to spend time in a hospital for an emergency situation is scary for anyone, but especially children. You also don\u2019t mention how long the stay was or the chances of it happening again. People who are allergic to spider bites can have huge welts and sores every time they are bitten. I know someone wary of spiders because previous bites have eaten away at muscle tissue. They are not overreacting when they avoid spiders.\n\nYour brother watched his child be hospitalized at a young age. When that happens it\u2019s scary and traumatic for parents as well as children. And it can\u2019t be surprising to you that this was traumatizing. This can\u2019t be the first time you heard they are afraid of and want to avoid spiders.\n\nYour husband really messed up. Your niece may still be dealing with the consequences of what happened, especially if they need to be careful due to allergies.\n\nIt\u2019s only been a week. Give it more time and keep apologizing.
