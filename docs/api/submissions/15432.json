We recently moved out of our modest apartment and into a 3-bedroom house. Since the house didn\u2019t come with a washer or dryer, we opened a line of credit for a new set. Our monthly expenses increased by about $700. \n\nAfter the move, my boyfriend proposed. It was a total surprise and I\u2019m thrilled. We opened up a joint checking account and have made a new budget to quickly pay off the washer and dryer, so we could focus on planning our wedding. \n\nOn a normal month, I make about $600 less than my fianc\u00e9 and that\u2019s what the new budget is planned around. \nHowever, on my last couple of paychecks I have been able to put in overtime and have made an extra $900 this month. I have the extra money set up to deposit into a separate account. My fianc\u00e9 knows about the separate account but I only told him about my first check of overtime, which was $325. He doesn\u2019t know about the other check. I\u2019ve also donated plasma this month and that money is on it\u2019s own account. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 has been worried about money since we\u2019re trying to pay off the washer and dryer so quickly, and there\u2019s our wedding to plan. There have been things for the house we\u2019ve needed to buy as well. \nI purchased a weed eater with some of my overtime check. I was afraid to tell him how much I spent, so I lied and told him it costed about half of what it actually did. I also told him I used the money from my plasma donation, when I actually used the money from my second overtime check. \n\nAm I the asshole for keeping the amount of money I\u2019m actually making a secret and not being forthcoming about the price of the appliance?", "created_utc": 1682173185, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12v7axu/aita_for_not_being_honest_with_my_fianc\u00e9_about/", "score": 576, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

In which case I understand why you would be hesitant because you're paying a larger proportion.\nI think from a relationship standpoint, it's not good to start out from a lie, but you need to work out why you're not comfortable being open with your partner about finances and only you know. We have no idea if you're just uncomfortable talking about it (maturity issue), or he's being too tight about the budget (and could relax it a bit) or is financially abusive. Just do some reading and think about it, but yeah, best not to do big purchases for now, it will eat out your wedding budget and your rainy day fund.\n\nI went with NTA because I remember an old timey grandma's advice to her grand daughter is to make sure she kept some get away money for herself that others wouldn't know about.

Now what you should do is just each have a certain percentage of your income you pool into a joint account like 60 percent or what have you and just be honest about it but I would t like openly discuss what you do with your 40 percent because sometimes a partner who isn\u2019t good with money will find excuses to convince you to spend it.", "If you are doing your share of chores still, plasma money and OT are yours.", "Is overtime a guaranteed thing?

This works for us because we discuss larger purchases - he got extra money helping his parents do something & he told me what he was spending the money on (mainly because he gives me the cash when he has to pay via cc). When I got a bonus at work, I told him what I was spending the money on. It\u2019s open communication, & we discuss if our extra money purchases are going to be for the household & what\u2019s going to be personal (buying leaf blower/shop vac vs upgrading computer).

And if you're still trying to have a child with this man, put that on hold until you get the money situation sorted out. It's not fair on your partner when you're actively keeping secrets and he thinks everything is fine and dandy and you're trying to have kids. Grow up yourself before you bring a child into the world.", "NTA just yet, but you're working on it! What you don't explain is your reasoning. Is he bad with money? Does he have a history of bad financial decisions? Like, what's REALLY behind this? If you're just a money hungry woman who thinks \"what's his is mine, and what's mine is mine\", just own it. \n\nQuestion to you: roles are reversed, and he's hiding money from you... now what? No one knows your relationship like you do, but if you're feeling guilty, you know what the answer is. Good luck!", "YTA. If you\u2019re working overtime as a way of making a little extra money from time to time, that\u2019s some thing that you should be open with. You should not be forced into a budget that includes overtime, but I think it is reasonable to use this extra cash for your own purchases.\n\nMy question is why you\u2019re hiding it. Do you think your boyfriend/fianc\u00e9 is going to be angry? He\u2019s going to demand all your money? If you\u2019re afraid of him that\u2019s a bigger issue.", "YTAAAAA", "I\u2019m torn on this one because of personal experience. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea to start keeping things from each other. It will ultimately lead to trust issues. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a bad idea for you to have your own funds though. Can you guys have a conversation about how you would like to build your own savings and maybe agree that only OT funds are specifically yours?\n\nI guess the final decision factor would be how would you feel if the situation was reversed? You you be pissed if your husband had a secret money fund, regardless of the intention?", "NTA you did over time and sold plasma that is not money you can count on always having and therefore put  into the regular budget . If you got a raise or something that will always be more then you should account for it.", "NTA! Maybe because I\u2019ve seen so many join their funds in marriage and somebody gets left empty handed. It\u2019s almost like people expect that when you marry you HAVE to join finances. I\u2019m an advocate of pooling together to split shared expenses like rent/mortgage, utilities and food, even home improvement like washer/dryer etc.. However if one decided to go buy a brand new car that\u2019s from their own money. Again my view is from seeing so many get crapped on when things unexpectedly go bad (both men and women). Everyone should have their own \u201cin case\u201d fund!", "YTA. Are you a family unit, or not?", "YTA\n\nBe honest but that doesn't mean you have to disclose everything. If you don't want to disclose how much you've got/are earning that's fine but it should be a discussion that you don't want to have to disclose everything rather than lying about your finances. You need to build up that bond of trust and discuss and agree on boundaries. Having your own finances is a really good idea but try and agree on how much of your finances are shared.", "I N F O: Why won't you answer any questions? \n\nYTA. Hardly engaged and you're already lying about money to avoid contributing your fair share. I hope he leaves your selfish ass.", "ESH\n\nyou shouldn\u2019t feel the need to lie about something so minor\n\nyour fianc\u00e9 shouldn\u2019t be proposing if he can\u2019t afford to provide for his future wife", "I know a couple that got divorced over a similar situation. Think on that.", "YTA for lying. It\u2019s one thing to not disclose details of your finances and a whole \u2018nuther thing to lie about it.", "NAH. It sounds like you need to have an open talk about finances. Why are we worried about buying things we need to buy? Is there shouting when he perceives money being overspent? Is he acting like since he makes more, he gets more say in what is spent? Is it past trauma about money in relationships popping up? Or just a \"he's really worried I don't want to add to his stress\" kind of thing? Like a lot could be happening here.\n\nI don't think it's wrong to put some money to the side, it's not like youre wasting it, and a joint account doesnt have to be 100% of everything you both make. The lying about the cost of things is bad though, and thst makes me worry more is happening behind the scenes.", "YTA do not lie about finances unless you are trying to exit an abusive relationship. Just, try communication and boundaries?", "It is ok to have a secret cash reserve. But it is important to your marriage for you to be open and honest about earnings.", "YTA\n\nIt's a big issue that you have problems discussing relatively small sums of money.\n\nThe way you handle money should suit you as a couple, not be an added hassle.", "You aren\u2019t the asshole for having a separate account. YTA for lying about it. \n\nMy partner and I have a joint chequing for joint expenses like rent. Otherwise, our finances are completely separate. That way, there\u2019s no stress that he\u2019s spending too much on games, or that I\u2019m spending too much on makeup or whatever.", "Not a good idea to lie about stuff with somebody you're planning to build a life with.", "YTA\n\nYou are about to be married, your expenses are joined expenses, why are you letting him worry over nothing? Do you not trust him?", "I don't think you should marry someone that you don't trust enough to be honest about finances with.", "YTA for lying.  You don't have to disclose the amount your earning, but don't lie when asked about something.  Look at it this way, if you're willing to lie about something as small as the cost of a weedeater, how can you be trusted to not lie about more serious things?  Trust is earned and once broken will take forever to rebuild.", "Not enough information but please be careful with a joint account. If things go south, one of you could drain the account and leave the other high and dry with no legal recourse for getting their portion of the money in the account back. \n\nY\u2019all need to discuss finances in detail and figure it out.", "Not really.  Some people get all worked up over wanting to know exactly how much money their significant other makes.  If you want to share with him great, if not, that's okay too.  NTAH.", "I think she should be honest about having a separate account but not necessarily combine. I know how much my wife makes because I've done the taxes for 27 years, but I don't know how much money she has in her account.\n\nShe would tell me if I asked but I don't. We each pay bills and cover necessities, and share other costs as needed. Other than that I don't pay attention to her spending, and she doesn't pay attention to mine.\n\nWe do have a joint household account we both contribute to and it makes it easy to transfer between us.", "Completely agree. You said you lied, that is not okay if you are seriously considering marriage. \n\nIt is totally fine if you want to have some of your finances separate but you need to be honest about that. My husband and I have a joint account for our mortgage/joint expenses but our own accounts for everything else. This works for us because we talked about it and agreed together. But we still continue to have discussions when we have something we\u2019re saving for or if one of us gets a good gig or commission. \n\nLike most things on this sub this can be solved by communicating with each other, if you continue lying YTA.", "These are the real issues OP needs to figure out heading into marriage. She did a lot of hiding and lying but explained to us zero reasoning why. The underlying anxiety or relationship tension is going to make or break the marriage unless she can get it figured out. YTA", "This should be at the top. We need to know the motivation behind why OP isn't telling him before making a proper judgment, imo.", "I am kinda confused how they have the money for a 3 bedroom but not a washer/dryer. Feel like they bought more house than they can afford and are now house-poor. We also just bought a 3 bedroom and are about to buy a washer/dryer, most units we are looking at are $1k each. Less than a percent of the house's down payment. But you can certainly find cheaper units.\n\nPoint being, if they didn't have the savings to buy the house and furnish it with the needed appliances, perhaps they spent too much on the house...? Then OP lies about finances and buys a weed whacker instead of paying off a card I presume has interest wracking up. Smells like a disaster in the making.\n\ne: just looked at her post history and she's posting pregnancy tests so I assume they are also trying to conceive right after buying a house they don't seem able to afford... babies cost a lot of money, yo.", "Exactly! What are you afraid will happen if you tell him about the money?", "Because she overspent on an item and didn\u2019t consult before making a purchase that was a joint household item.", "this is common in most cultures", "The reason is she's the asshole.", "You can have a rainy day fund. You can't lie to your partner about finances.", "OP DONATED PLASMA. If they want to get a weed eater as a gift, without the fianc\u00e9 knowing what it cost, that\u2019s their business. NTA. Overtime is not always a given either.", "Then I'm sticking with my original judgment. Everyone needs their own fun/run money.", "In many countries you aren't permitted to sell either.", "Agree. If you're donating plasma and working overtime to pick up extra cash, this is probably a household changing sum of money. Brunt honest about finances and what contributions you can make to your household is part of the foundation of a healthy relationship. If you have to lie about income, reassess why.", "But...then why are they increasing monthly expenses by $700? Why is a washer and dryer monthly payment more than a car? And wtf kind of weed eater was purchased that was paid for out of the $900 OT check?? I am so confused.", "Glad I\u2019m not the only one. That was the first thing that stood out to me and I had to re-read and still doesn\u2019t make sense to me.", "I thought the same thing! I was so confused. Thanks for asking.", "Me too!", "Yes, YATA! You are lying to the man you want to marry! Really bad way to start your life with someone! trust is huge! Come clean before he finds out on his own ...won't end well otherwise.", "Do you have an agreed amount that you both deposit in the joint account every month? You should. As long as you both deposit your agreed sums into that and use it for household spending, separate accounts are fine, and you shouldn\u2019t need to either tell each w much you have in your own accounts, or lie about costs. You need to get something sorted so you don\u2019t lie. \n\nAt present, YTA, for lying, and both of you for having these payment decisions that cause so much stress.", "Don\u2019t lie to your significant other.", "Has anyone already said, \u201chonesty is the best policy?\u201d", "NTA that's rare overtime pay, not a permanent raise.", "YTA wtf. If you\u2019re not ready to be open about money don\u2019t marry this guy.", "YTA. And marriages that begin on a foundation of dishonesty do not work well. If you can't discuss finances openly with the person you're deciding to spend your life with, regardless of whether it's due to them being controlling or your own lack of maturity, do not get married.", "So many lies. This won\u2019t end well. If you can lie about little things like the cost of an appliance or tool, then he won\u2019t know what big things you can also lie about. \n\nTime to tell him the truth. Also time to figure out why you are doing this. Is he controlling around money, do you have history with financial insecurity that makes you anxious, do you trust him etc?", "Is this about needing some control over money you earn?  If so, he may feel the same way.  You two are now rushing to do everything all at once. Why?\nCan\u2019t you relax about when to have a wedding and if you feel compelled to spend so much on it.  Lots of ways to have a lovely wedding without spending so much money you have to work yourself to death.  \n\nYou and your fiancee need to understand how much money is coming in and you both need to slow down and ensure that each of you keeps a percentage of income that is free to be spent without explanations.", "Plus she's trying to conceive and makes like $15 an hour at office Depot.  They just bought a house, fiance is worried about money, she's hiding money....sounds like a bit of a mess.", "I don\u2019t know that he is controlling.  But if OP thinks he\u2019s controlling, then that would be one reason why she might justify hiding her money from him.  But if that\u2019s the case, I am arguing she shouldn\u2019t marry him.  And if he\u2019s not controlling, then she has some serious issues. And again, they shouldn\u2019t get married. And honestly, if I were him, and I found out what she did. I would rethink getting married to her.", "Not if it is already spent to get out the door and into other housing", "Are you guys just socially inept, people say I'm scared to tell someone something all the time to mean they just don't want to hurt them. Like this is such a common expression.", "Right. So you just made a bunch of stuff up. \n\nThere was never any need to villainize this guy. You've imagined him up into a potential monster for no reason whatsoever. \n\nMeanwhile, this girl IS lying right to his face and IS actually being controlling by manipulating household purchases and you go soft on her with \"immature\".", "Wow.  You were just looking for a reason to get upset.  Good luck with that.", "$700 is a whole washer OR dryer. A modest one but still. If bought used, that's both. What the hell did they buy that they have to pay $700 for months? Sounds like both are not smart about money if they blow thousands for appliances for a damn rental.", "Lol if the guy was controlling I\u2019d think OP would\u2019ve said something about it in her own post. But she didn\u2019t, so TBH it just sounds like you\u2019re trying to make excuses for OP.", "I must be in hysterics, right?", "I wonder if the $700 is not just for the washer/dryer, but for the expenses of the whole house being more than the apt", "My impression was that their OVERALL household expenses increased by $700/month.\n\nAnd where I live a very basic washing machine is about 1200-3000. Dryers are similar.", "It would depend on why you feel the need to hide this money from him? You need to figure out if the reason is  enough to pause getting married.", "Uhm.l, yes. YTA. Why do you feel the need to lie?", "Yeah I think you sorta are TA, you shouldn't be lying or deceiving your fianc\u00e9 about things like this.\n\nHowever, I do NOT see anything wrong with having a separate bank account for your extra money.   \n\nPersonally, I think its really weird that couples only have one joint account where all of their income goes into.  IMO, yes there should be a joint account that is used for all bills.  Income should go into each partners personal accounts and they then transfer their share of the monthly bills as calculated by whichever method the couple decide (and a bit extra for emergencies) into the joint *bills* account.  If extra money is needed for expenses over and above the budgeted amount then extra money is transferred.", "don\u2019t lie about money, it will ruin your relationship. i think it\u2019s a good idea to keep your personal money in your own account and transfer money for your shared relationship things into the joint account. but if you lie about it where the money comes from, it will cause problems. establish a ratio based on salary if need be, but keep it clear who does what and pay joint expenses out of the joint account. and if you got extra money to pay for a joint expense, congrats on your gift to yourself. don\u2019t expect them to account for it the same way you do.", "INFO: is there a reason you feel the need to have this hidden amount from your fianc\u00e9? As in are you afraid, feel threatened, unsure etc to the point where you are putting together a back up plan, in case you need to run?", "NTA. Everyone is entitled to have their own personal bank account. If there's a partner, then open a joint account where both parties will routinely deposit a specific amount into the account for rent or mortgage or bills. No need to lie. If he loves you, he will respect and support your decision. You work hard to earn the extra cash, not him.", "I\u2019m going against the grain but NTA. When I started my own family and began living with a man, EVERY SINGLE WOMAN in my life pulled me aside and cautioned me to have money put aside that he didn\u2019t know about/ could access. Multiple generations of woman begging me to learn from their mistakes by always making sure I had a cushion to land on. Everyone with the YTA replies aren\u2019t thinking about what if this relationship turns sour. What if you become injured and can no longer work? What happens if you get pregnant and have to rely solely on his income? What happens if he becomes abusive, financially or mentally? As long as your prior financial obligations with him are completed, their is absolutely no reason you can\u2019t have money that he doesn\u2019t know about. Protect yourself. Protect your money.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking. For some reason people are focusing on the washer and dryer/weed eater, and forgetting that they just just got a 3 bed room house.", "Yup, YTA. As someone who has been married for twenty years\u2026 if you can\u2019t be honest about this, you are not ready to get married.", "YTA \n\nIf you can't talk honestly about money, you shouldn't get married.

It\u2019s not even about the money it\u2019s because you\u2019re constantly lying to your SO.", "I think it's important to investigate why you feel it necessary to hide money from your boyfriend before any judgment can be passed.", "You should ask yourself why you keep feeling like you need to lie. YTA not really a good way to start off a marriage.", "NAH but if you don't want to share finances completely, you need to be honest about that. Lots of couples have shared money and separate money. My partner and I run a business together with more in assets than either of us make in a year and we pay ourselves separate wages that we spend separately.", "Okay but WHY dont you want to tell your fiance? Does this come from a place of distrusting him with finances? Like are you afraid he will mismanage your money? Are you trying to set up a secret nest egg so you can leave him? Do you want money to spend on whatever you want without having to contribute as much to shared costs like housing/food/wedding?\n\nRight before a wedding is a terrible time to start hiding and lying about money. Your partner could rethink everything they know about you and how they think you operate within your partnership if you make this a habbit. You clearly feel bad so Im sure you wont keep doing this.But If i were you I would take a moment to really think about what is driving you to not tell your partner about the money. Like why do you feel the need to lie to them about it? Thats really important going forward", "Regardless, why is she lying about it? Seems like it could create a big problem for no reason."]}
