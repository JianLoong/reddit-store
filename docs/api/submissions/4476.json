{"id": 4476, "submission_id": "zizduk", "title": "AITA for leaving for a ski trip while my wife and kid were asleep?", "selftext": "My wife and I have a daughter, Chloe (4). Chloe has autism and developmental delays. \n\nChloe gets very clingy to my wife when she doesn\u2019t feel well and she\u2019s basically been sick since Halloween. One thing she does when she doesn\u2019t feel well is refuse to sleep without my wife, so almost every night for the past month and a half, my wife and Chloe have been sleeping in the guest room. \n\nThe problem is Chloe is a kicker and likes to sprawl out so my wife doesn\u2019t sleep well when she\u2019s sleeping next to Chloe. To let her get some rest, I\u2019ve been getting up an hour and a half early every day so I could take Chloe in the mornings. I get her dressed, do her hair, give her breakfast, and drop her off at daycare/play with her on weekends while my wife locks herself in the guest room. \n\nThis has been exhausting so when my friends invited me on a ski trip last weekend I obviously wanted to go. I tried to tell my wife about it but she shut it down immediately. I thought she was being unfair because at least she gets a break in the mornings and when Chloe\u2019s at daycare. I don\u2019t get a break so last weekend I packed up and left the house before Chloe and my wife woke up. I sent her a text telling her where I am and when I\u2019ll be back. \n\nWhen I got back, there was a note saying Chloe and my wife were staying with my wife\u2019s family and that she hopes the trip was worth it. The only time she\u2019s spoken to me is when she texted me pictures of Chloe at a park to let me know that she\u2019s okay. \n\nMy friends all say she\u2019s overreacting and that she shouldn\u2019t keep my kid from me but my mom called me and cursed me out for leaving my wife with Chloe over the weekend.

We\u2019re you at least planning on letting your wife do a weekend trip with her friends?", "Yta, what the actual F. So you are saying your wife gets breaks while your kid is at daycare. She is probably meal prepping, cleaning, running errands for you, etc. So you really think she is just laying around relaxing? How dense can you be. You literally ran away from your family so they couldn't tell you no. F right off sir. Have fun being single and paying child support. The audacity.\n\nAnd thinking you are giving her some sort of major treat for letting her sleep 1.5 hours uninterrupted, seriously. This is 1.5 hours of what should be an 8 hour night while you are soundly sleeping alone in your own bed. Dude, grow up.", "YTA. You're so the asshole your own mother sees it. **You** don't get a break? Are you fucking serious? Your wife has been sleep-deprived for over a month! *I get her dressed, do her hair, give her breakfast, and drop her off at daycare*. That's called parenting. You don't get a trophy for doing the bare minimum of parenting, and you certainly don't get to abandon your family for four days. And not only are you a huge asshole, you're a coward.

OMG, how could you think sneaking away for a long weekend skiing with your friends was the right thing to do?", "YTA. Your wife needs help but you need to hit the slopes, how is that a fair marriage?", "YTA and a spineless one on top of it. \"She gets 2 hours before work and 2 hours after work\" I'm also going to guess that since to you she doesn't  \"work\" the way you do that you feel handling the running of the house is her responsibility as well. Thank goodness she has actual family to support her and don't be surprised if the next contact from your wife is in the form of divorce papers & a child support application. All parents get tired and want a break but most don't take that break at the expense of their partner. You should be ashamed of yourself.", "In what world could you be anything but TA? You describe parenting *your own* special needs daughter as \u201cgiving your wife a break in the mornings\u201d. Dude, where is your head? Your wife gets horrible sleep all night while parenting the daughter you share, and you want kudos and credit for taking the daughter for 90 minutes in the mornings? All that makes YTA, and I haven\u2019t even gotten to the part where you left for a trip, while your daughter is sick, after your wife asked you not to, while she was sleeping. \n\nYou didn\u2019t want to make decisions as a husband or as a father and it seems like now, you might not have to worry about that anymore.", "Obviously YTA, you have to agree that in advance. You're clearly in a difficult situation but you can't just up and leave", "Wow. Wow wow wow. YTA.", "YTA.   So what you are saying is that your wife gets about an hour and half of decent sleep per night after you wake up Chloe and feed her and drop her off at daycare.\n\nHow very parenting of you.\n\nThat said, I get you need a break but so does your wife.    Maybe instead of insisting on a solo getaway for yourself because you wake up early perhaps you could have offered that she go do whatever she wanted the following weekend so that both of you could get some well earned relaxation.", "YTA - she isn\u2019t taking a break while Chloe is at day care - odds are she is working - you know cleaning the house, washing YOUR clothes, cooking - and I\u2019m guessing probably has a part time outside job hence the need for day care.   She gets 1.5 hours of real sleep a night - could you function on that if that\u2019s all you got for a month and half!?!?  What you meant was she gets a break from Chloe right?   It\u2019s sooo hard being a parent - hope she recognizes that YTA and leaves you.", "The audacity of some Fathers after they do the bare minimum is outstanding. YTA", "YTA. What break are you not getting? You get a full night\u2019s sleep. She does not. She gets a whopping hour and a half. Plus she works during the week. Plus she presumably takes over the other household responsibilities.", "You actually took a trip without telling your wife in advance?  She just woke up and you had bailed for 4 days, leaving her with a sick, needy child?  And you even have to ask if YTA???  Hope it was worth it... on the bright side, you'll have a lot more down time when you only see your kid on weekends once the divorce goes through!", "YTA. she works 15 hours a week and does more of the household chores. (confirmed by OP) you say your child clings to her mother when sick which allows you to leave, have you ever considered your child clings to her mother BECAUSE you leave? \nwhen she divorces you don\u2019t be shocked", "YTA. Parenting is a 24/7 job. You don\u2019t just get to take a break whenever you feel like it. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not saying parents don\u2019t need and deserve breaks. But you have to schedule those appropriately and you have to understand that sickness can throw a wrench in those plans. \n\nYour actions told your wife that having fun with friends is more important than taking care of her and your daughter, and then you have the audacity to say it\u2019s not fair for her to keep your daughter from you? You wanted a break, and now you\u2019re getting one. Welcome, consequences of your own actions", "INFO: your daughter has been sick since Halloween? That\u2019s around six weeks. Were you not in anyway worried about not knowing how your sick kid was for 4 days?\n\nBecause I think others have covered your AH attitude to your wife but what the french fried fuck were you thinking about your daughter?\n\nShe\u2019s sick for what seems a long time even for a little kid in winter bug season, her autism means she doesn\u2019t do well with change and you\u2019ve been doing this dad daughter routine with her hair each day during a time she\u2019s fragile and clingy and you just bail on her without any prepping her or even a goodbye?\n\nI suspect your wife can understand some aspects of each parent struggling with inequitable situations with little kids. But like me she cannot understand how you just skipped out on your sick kid for 4 whole days making like a bandit in the wee hours.\n\nYou remind me of my dad. I can\u2019t even be bothered to set up a Google Alert for his obituary we are so deeply estranged. In fact I actually have no idea if he\u2019s dead. Kids do that when they have no trust a parent is coming back. They detach. Your daughter might be so upset daddy picked skiiing she doesn\u2019t want to see you.

You left on a 4 day trip and think that equals 1.5 hours in the morning?  Hope you didn\u2019t like being married cause your wife sounds like she\u2019s out", "What does your wife do while your child is at daycare? \n\nHow exactly does one send a sick child to daycare? \n\nWould you have thought your wife the AH if she had done the exact same thing to you sneaking off with her friends for the weekend? \n\nIf this isn\u2019t a troll post - then your mom had every right to curse you out because you are a demonstration of her parenting and she\u2019s embarrassed by your complete and utter lack of responsibility, empathy, maturity, etc. I\u2019m sure she thought she raised you better.\n\nOh obviously YTA", "YTA.

Why the hell would she be there when you came back? YTA.", "YTA and incredibly selfish. Your child is sick \nand you abandoned her with your wife. Parenting is a 24/7 job for both parents and it sounds like you wife is putting in more work, all the while, losing sleep. How would you react if she just packed up and left you with your sick special needs daughter for a vacation? Also, 4 days is not a weekend.

You don't just pack up and leave without a word for ~~a weekend~~ *four fucking days* when you have a kid - especially not a kid with autism and developmental delays. You can go away for a weekend with your buddies when your child is better, not while she is clinging to your wife and keeping her from having a restful sleep.", "Ummm. You do realize that you are in a relationship, right. And you have a child together. Things like this need to be communicated ahead of time. You cont just up and leave because you felt entitled to it, for whatever reason. Common sense is truly uncommon.  YTA.", "YTA for leaving unexpectedly and sneaking out. She has a right to be upset. It sounds to me you are both experiencing a blow out. It is time for you to to sit and talk. Couples counseling for sure. I understand that you have been helping with your daughter but yes yta.", "YTA, you get rest, while your wife is up all night and day, watching the child, doing chores, and going to work herself and YOU need a break?! I will never get over the audacity some people have.", "YTA. Instead of acting like a responsible grownup, you snuck out like a teenager meeting their friends at the lake. When you both decided to have children, you both signed up for that responsibility. Your decision may have cost your marriage. \n\nOh, and let me guess - the friends that say you\u2019re overreacting were the ones that were on this ski trip with you?\n\nHope that ski trip was worth it.", "Yes, OP, YTA. How is this even a question? You snuck out and left your family behind for a weekend to go play with your friends after your partner explicitly told you that she did not approve. She has barely been able to sleep for the past month and a half, and you think YOU are exhausted because you\u2019ve been taking care of your own daughter for 90 minutes in the morning?

You\u2019re precious hour and a half you \u201cgive\u201d her isn\u2019t enough and you know it. What do you think she\u2019s doing when baby is at daycare? Lounging around and sleeping?

Parenting is not something you get to run away from for the weekend without making arrangements. \n\nImagine if he woke up and found his wife had sent the same email to him. \u201cSaw the email, called your friend, said I could join them if I brought the beer, see you Sunday night.

Compared to your several hours of not disrupted sleep. Imagine your wife had done that, how would you feel? Also, your child is not well.

Honestly, to even the score, she should get to leave for a spa weekend paid by you.", "You never get a break?

How would you like to wake up to her gone for days leaving you with your daughter? You are a bad husband and I hope it was worth it.

I said that's great you're going on a weekend away drinking and akiing but it's my reunion which I flew in specifically for, it starts at a specific time, and sister can't be left on her own so you need to wait until mum gets home.

Chloe has autism and developmental delays. \n\nChloe gets very clingy to my wife when she doesn\u2019t feel well and she\u2019s basically been sick since Halloween. One thing she does when she doesn\u2019t feel well is refuse to sleep without my wife, so almost every night for the past month and a half, my wife and Chloe have been sleeping in the guest room. \n\nThe problem is Chloe is a kicker and likes to sprawl out so my wife doesn\u2019t sleep well when she\u2019s sleeping next to Chloe. To let her get some rest, I\u2019ve been getting up an hour and a half early every day so I could take Chloe in the mornings. I get her dressed, do her hair, give her breakfast, and drop her off at daycare/play with her on weekends while my wife locks herself in the guest room. \n\nThis has been exhausting so when my friends invited me on a ski trip last weekend I obviously wanted to go. I tried to tell my wife about it but she shut it down immediately. I thought she was being unfair because at least she gets a break in the mornings and when Chloe\u2019s at daycare. I don\u2019t get a break so last weekend I packed up and left the house before Chloe and my wife woke up. I sent her a text telling her where I am and when I\u2019ll be back. \n\nWhen I got back, there was a note saying Chloe and my wife were staying with my wife\u2019s family and that she hopes the trip was worth it. The only time she\u2019s spoken to me is when she texted me pictures of Chloe at a park to let me know that she\u2019s okay. \n\nMy friends all say she\u2019s overreacting and that she shouldn\u2019t keep my kid from me but my mom called me and cursed me out for leaving my wife with Chloe over the weekend.

Your daughter has been sick and you yourself have said that when Chloe is I\u2019ll she gets clingy. \n\nYour wife must be physically and emotionally exhausted, but you need a break. Sorry but parenting whilst rewarding is a demanding full time job. They don\u2019t let up and you\u2019re permanently on call. Well, not in your case you sneak out. \n\nYour wife deserves a break too from you! \n\nThe entitlement here is astounding. You need to apologise and grovel and take every shit chore going and pray to whoever you believe in that your wife is a saint and can be that forgiving.

I usually try to be as understanding as I can when reading these but you the AH. Several reasons for this:\n\n 1) When you\u2019re in a marriage what you do is necessarily limited by what your partner does/wants/needs etc. And ofc this goes both ways. If you\u2019re tired and need company her options would naturally be limited by your needs. As such when your partner says she wants you to stay with her, unless you came to a mutually agreed upon compromise you respect your partner. Ofc whose opinion gets respected falls into circumstance and where the greater importance or risk falls. I.e. if you had a career changing meeting instead of a friends ski trip it\u2019d be a different conversation altogether. You\u2019re the AH for not respecting your partners wish because taking care of a child, YOUR child, is far more important in this scenario.\n\n 2) WTF! you get up an hour and half every morning to get your girl and let your wife rest. Congrats you fulfilled the most basic conditions of being a father and a husband. you don\u2019t get to claim the moral high ground for doing something that is your literal fucking responsibility. And lets just do the maths right? you get up and hour half early, but your wife is not only trying to get a sick and clingy toddler to sleep (not an easy feat as you can\u2019t just feed it to sleep like an infant) but she also has to deal with the accumulating fatigue from not being able to sleep well. Who knows how long it takes your daughter to fall asleep and how many times your wife wakes up at night either due to her sprawling or because your daughter wakes up. I\u2019d say a night of full sleep and an early morning does you more good than not. \n\n 3) How many of your friends have a wife and child? how many of them have taken care of a toddler? and depending on the answer how are they in any position to comment on what your wife feels or is doing? does anyone of them know what its been like taking care of a sick child for a whole month and a half? not only did you leave you wife IN SECRET you also said basically that your friends not only matter more, but know more about your wife and child more than your wife.

You work FT and she works PT. Wonderful. BUT when this child has been sick and clingy suddenly that PT job becomes her secondary and being a full time caregiver starts to add up. FAST. \n\nAll those hours of sleepless nights, the worrying, the trying to find solutions, the blame, the shame, add up and wear you down so entirely it hurts. (and I mean this in the sense that does she blame and shame herself for not being able to make it better automatically. NOT that she is ashamed of your daughter for her autism. If she IS though still at that stage that just adds to feelings of helplessness in an already hard situation)\n\nWhat you both should have done before hand is had a plan for how you can equally take on supporting the other while STILL helping your child in the way that works best for her needs. If she\u2019s clingy to her mom, then it\u2019s on you to pick up and help mom so mom can focus NOT on everything else but on that child getting better. You could have asked her what would have been most helpful to her that week/day. And YES you work and deserve a break but so does SHE and she can\u2019t say no to the child. Neither of you get that option single-handedly with a special needs child and NO it\u2019s not fair, YES it sucks like hell, and ABSOLUTELY it is a huge emotional, physical, and mental drain to have to do ALL the time but that\u2019s your lives. BOTH of you. \n\nYou \u201cgiving\u201d her a couple hours here and there may NOT actually be helping her. If you haven\u2019t asked your wife what she needs and understanding WHY you may inadvertently be ADDING to her problems, stress, and contributing to her feeling helpless. That\u2019s not what you wanted I\u2019m sure. Open communication is key in ANY marriage but even MORE so when you have a special needs child. You need to work on that. \n\nFinally, you DID handle the situation so inappropriately by just leaving. Not only did you violate your WIFE\u2019s trust, you weren\u2019t there for your child either. For 4 days. For 4 days you just decided that \u201cit\u2019s ok to not uphold deeper obligations\u201d and that was not ok. What you COULD have done is expressed you wanted to go. Offered the wife a turn of her OWN at a break of EQUAL amount when you got back, or found a better compromise. The child may prefer mom but IF mom wasn\u2019t available you are STILL her father. Step up.

As someone who has lived through this, completely judging you is above Reddits paygrade. It's a complex issue.\n\nSecondly, if you already haven't, you need to talk with a professional about Chloe. If you don't have the money, you need to apply to programs that are either low cost or would provide aid.\n\nA professional would be able to talk to you about what Chloe needs, how you can help her, and her capabilities. They'd be able to advise you."]}
