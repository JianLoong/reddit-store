I'm also the oldest in my family. I have four younger siblings. Two bio brothers who are on the spectrum and two sisters who are biologically my cousins and were adopted by my parents as babies. Both have Down Syndrome. All four of my younger siblings have significant challenges and health issues. Over the years it has drained my parents resources and left very little for anything fun. It was only when I started working two years ago that I could afford to treat myself occasionally. Sometimes it's my favorite gummies. Sometimes I save up to buy something. I bought myself a laptop earlier this year with my money because I needed something especially with school and everything and using the family computer didn't work as much now because dad works later in the days than he used to.\n\nFor the last few months I have paid for certain groceries for myself. Since there are so many different meals made in our house and I usually ended up with stuff I didn't really enjoy, I decided to occasionally buy in stuff so I could make myself something I'd like and it was one less person for my mom to prepare food for.\n\nMy brothers both have safe foods and my sisters are also bad eaters who have limitations due to allergies but also due to not enjoying the taste of a lot of things.\n\nI know my parents have been struggling to afford all the safe foods, allergen foods and then stuff for themselves. A while ago my dad asked if I could buy some family groceries for everyone and I sat and asked him if I could just get more of what I like for everyone and he said no. He and my mom don't like the foods I do. My siblings couldn't and wouldn't eat them. He said just get the usual stuff and I can live off of stuff I don't love. I told him I didn't want to do that. That I was trying to enjoy food more and it was one less person for them to buy for. We compromised and I would buy myself groceries all the time instead of sometimes.\n\nThen a couple of weeks ago some foods ran out and my dad had to use his credit card to buy a few extra groceries. I was the only person who didn't run out that week. My parents were pissed. They asked why I took care of myself so much but wouldn't help out with my family. Mom said it's exhausting having to feed so many different people with different needs and I could at least buy food for my siblings if I can't give a shit about her and dad. They said I was selfish and I should be thinking of my family over just me. My parents said I would probably let everyone starve before I help out and then they accused me of resenting them for adopting my sisters and adding more additional needs kids to our family. But they said that's what family does and I should be ashamed. They also said I should never have bought the laptop and could have helped out more financially without it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697364334, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178c86x/aita_for_not_using_the_money_i_earn_to_buy_family/", "score": 1926, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Best place to start is the caseworker. If I was you I\u2019d contact dcf myself and explain exactly what you said, your family is struggling to make ends meet after adopting and pressuring you to provide. They won\u2019t be in trouble they\u2019ll be provided resources and help for all of you", "NTA\n\nYour parents are actually legally obligated to provide for you till you are 18 and they are not doing that.\n\nIt sounds as though they were doing okay... until you started earning money... okay your siblings probably eat more too because they are bigger and food is more expensive.  You are already helping them out by paying for your own food.  You also have provided your own laptop that your parents didn't have to pay for.\n\nYour dad either needs to find a higher paying job or utilise some of the services available for people with disabilities.  Do your siblings go to school?  The cousins with T21 would go to a disability school who hopefully provide food so that's one less meal a day they would need.  I would hope that these schools would be like public schools and there isn't big fees for them.\n\nWhat about your brothers?  Are they in school?\n\nYour parents may be eligible for disability payments to help support the younger kids too which would take a little bit of the pressure off.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to feed your siblings.  It's great that you offered to help but you are not obligated to.", "NTA\n\nYou are 16 and not responsible for your parents decisions, FFS", "NTA. You need the laptop for your education, don\u2019t feel guilty for that. Can you get in touch with a local food bank and get some supplies for your family? And I\u2019m sure an autism or downs charity would be able to try to help your family in some way to lessen the burden. Your parents are putting huge expectations on your shoulders at 16 to fix their problems as parents. It\u2019s their job to figure out how to care for so many people, not yours.", "NTA but your parents are. They can take their bleeding heart BS and shove it. They have a legal obligation to provide for you untill you are 18 and they are not even doing that. This is a form of neglect and would be illegal in most countries.  Its their job to raise you to have success in life, not just as a rescource for their pitty project. They chose to take on these responsiblities, its on them to deal with it. Yeah its hard but they chose to do a hard thing but they should have thought of that before they got started. No one forced them to have 3 kids, no one forced them to addopt 2 more.  They should just admit their failure and go to social services rather then drag you down with them. Because right now they are being the selfish and irresponsible ones. Yeah family helps thats what they do, but parents provide, thats what they do.\n\nIf they want more money they can get a job that pays better or work more hours. If you start not you will never get out of this. Even if you move out they will still be asking for your help", "NTA. You're providing for yourself. Surely you'd think that with resources spread thin there'd be gratitude on their part. You're demonstrating that you're capable of taking care of your needs and wants as a basic understanding of finances. What I as an adult appreciate is that you're cooking meals for yourself. That's an incredibly valuable life skill for any person.", "\"Cool story dad, but still against the law.\"\n\nYou can help if you want, which you _have offered to do_. You're not legally responsible for your siblings, that's your parents responsibility. \n\nAre they good people taking on more children? Perhaps.\n\nBut they have no right to offload their responsibilities on to you. You don't need to join in their suffering.\n\nThough you may want to hide your laptop,  they sound very resentful about it, and I don't know what type of people they are.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You\u2019re just a kid yourself, and they should be at least a little bit more grateful that you took the initiative to take some of the stress of caring for so many kids by taking care of yourself. The situation sucks, but it\u2019s not your fault and they shouldn\u2019t make you feel like it is.", "NTA. Honestly you are helping the family by being self efficent, buying food and other things. It cant be helped they wont eat what you buy or that its unlucky the other kids all have problems. I'm sure your parents are just stressed when they said those things, but it was super shitty of them. Just keep saving so you can get out when you turn 18, it shouldnt be your responsibility to take care of everyone (especially since they adopted 2 kids on top of what they already have, its a nice thing but it sounds like it came at a high cost)", "NTA. You started working when 14, now you're 16 and providing for yourself, maybe you could help a little bit more, but that's not on you, NOT YOUR DUTY. Your family was already in a dificult situation and your parents decided to adopt two special needs children despite all, they're the adults that made that decision, not you. I suggest you start saving as much money as possible to be able to live by yourself, you deserve some peace, and then maybe try to help your parents and siblings if possible,but  you have no legal obligations towards them, you deserve to live your life, not theirs.", "Oh sweetie. NTA but start saving money so you can move out asap. It\u2019s understandable that your family is struggling but it isn\u2019t your struggle. Good luck.", "NTA. Your dad's remark about the laptop has me worried though. If I were you, I'd take it with me wherever I go or find a safe place to hide it. Sounds a bit like he's preparing to make you sell it or do it himself.   \nAlso one question for better understanding: when your parents took in your cousins, were your brothers already born and diagnosed?", "Nah. \n\nAs noble as your parents are for taking on all these challenges, you made no such commitments. Your parents wanting you to help makes sense. You wanting not to makes sense.\n\nMove out asap!", "NTA. You\u2019re 16 and have been working to provide for yourself- that\u2019s helping more than enough. What they are asking is not your responsibility. They are being unfair and are straight up wrong for guilt tripping you. Sorry but they should be ashamed for how they handled that, not you.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to feed your siblings. That is your parents job. You offered a very reasonable compromise if buying your own food, which you should have to do.", "NTA\n\nI can understand your parents being angry because they are stressed, but the stress is from overextending themselves. 5 children is a lot. I don't know if your cousins were adopted before or after your brothers were born but if they were before your biological siblings, your parents shouldn't have gone through with two more pregnancies (not that your brothers are bad people or anything, but your parents just can't afford them). If after, I understand wanting to adopt them, but is there any extended family that could help with the situation?\n\nBut no matter what, the money you earn from your job is your money. Spending the money on a laptop is a good investment if it is really helping with your education. In college, a laptop is basically a necessity, so you have a headstart. In the future, if you want to help when the family is in a pinch, you could return excess food, and help buy food for the family, but you have no obligation to. Know that you are helping them, they just might not completely realize it since they are stressed from their situation.\n\nI would start saving money where you can though. Depending on the situation, you may want to look into moving out when you are 18+. When living on your own, an emergency fund is crucial (3 to 6 months worth of living expenses at minimum, that includes rent, groceries, utilities, toiletries, phone service, internet, insurance, and gas if you have a car, all this money you do not touch unless absolutely necessary). Also know, depending on the field you want to go into, college is not all it's cracked up to be. If you want to go into law, politics, STEM, econ, or business administration, it is necessary, but if it's blue collar work you want, trade school is a better investment. Anything in the arts is hard to get a well paying job (everywhere is hard, but art is especially hard), no matter the path you take, so college for art, in my opinion, is a scam.", "\nIt sounds like with these people if you give them an inch they'll take a mile! So be careful with any help you agree to give because one week they'll be happy with whatever you agree to do and the next week they'll be guilt tripping you about your computer again! Such BS!", "NTA you are already helping bye buying your own food and that is a lot of help!! You are still a child it is your parents responsibility to give you the basic needs not the other way around! If they are struggling there is assistance out there or other ways to get funding to take care of the family!!!", "NTA. If you live in the U.S., and your parents legally adopted your sisters, they might be receiving government assistance as part of the deal. Some kinship adoptions offer a monthly guardian or assistance monetary award, and even SNAP or WIC. They also might be receiving Social Security if one or both of your sisters' bio parents are deceased. It probably wouldn't cover the cost of their food and needs, but helps a lot.\n\nTell your parents that you cannot offer more help than you are at the moment. They sound like if they have their way, you will give them all your money, all the time. It's not a minor child's job to support their parents, ever.", "NTA \n\nThis is crazy they took in the extra kids and basically op has no issues so gets no say. I\u2019m starting to feel that my advice to kids in this situation should be if having an issue gives you a pass to get food that you want and extra support then every time dinner is served and you don\u2019t really want that food throw a tantrum. Hey it works for everyone else.", "NTA.\n\nMost of what I want to say has already been shared in other comments. \n\nI just wanted to add the following.\n\nI hope I don't come across as condescending but I admire your maturity, how you have strong and appropriate boundaries and a very healthy relationship with yourself!", "NTA, it's a sh\\*\\*y situation which I don't envy. TBPH, they're approach is off. It's way to accusational. They are the ones who stepped up to help your cousins, you didn't volunteer for that. They're so focused on the things they gave up they didn't realize you have also sacrificed a lot, but unlike them, you were not consulted about this sacrifice before hand. If I were you, I'd go talk to a Navy recruiter tomorrow. Go for a rate that gives you a security clearance, there are always jobs for people with a TS/SCI. TBPH, if things are that tight and your parents are not spending anything frivolously, I would chip in, even though they're being really manipulative about it.", "NTA.\nAlso, you started working at 14? Isn't that illegal?\nBut, depending on where you're from, you'll need to live there for 2 more years or so. The situation isn't going to get any better. You need to figure out either how you're going to make a horrible situation livable, or how you're going to develop your own coping mechanisms to shut them out.", "NTA but i would like you to consider the familys finances in the decision. Some familys, the only way people get fed is if everyone contributes. Others, its not needed. So please consider the familys needs.   \nIf your family does have money issues, maybe offer a % of your income to be your contribution. The % means if you dont work for a bit, you wont go into debt to this.   \nPersonally, dipping into a credit card for food isnt the point where i would ask a kid for food money. It would be after I have visited food pantys for myself and cannot afford the safe foods.", "This is a very hard one. I am going to have to go with NAH. You are definitely N T A OP. It's the responsibility of your parents to provide for their children at least until they turn 18. You are already taking care of yourself. I can understand your parents' situation too. They have unfortunately bit off more than what they can chew. They are N T A to ask you for help but they definitely will be if they continue to pester you about this.\nThere are many resources available for parents of disabilities. Your parents may want to go through them.", "INFO: Could you explain what 'on the spectrum' means? Not common language in my location. Additionally, the compromise was HOW long ago in weeks?", "Do you contribute to household expenses now you are working? I had a saturday job whilst I was at college and although it didn't amount to much I always paid a little to mum to help out. Anyway NTA, the other children aren't your responsibility, nor are your parents, you are still a child yourself. What happens to these disabled kids when your parents die out of interest? Watch out for being on the hook for that one.", "NTA I mean you COULD be a better son and offer them some free money every now and again so long as they don't start demanding it. A kid isn't parents free income, and you are not responsible for your siblings. In matter of fact there should be less groceries needed with you feeding yourself. Your old enough to sit your parents down and tell them you're buying your own food and it is one mouth they don't have to feed, if you have any free income you don't mind sharing, and  you rather not have them demand money. Also I would start squirreling away some money in plans on moving out when you are legally able in case", "Well if you're not gonna help when they need it you should not be living with them. Get your own place and then you're gonna see how it feels. Then you're gonna run out of food and need them to buy you some food.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My school has a program that sends students who need it home with food every Friday to help the family get through the weekend when there aren't free school lunches and breakfasts available (this would help provide food for OP's parents so they have more money to get the younger kids their safe foods). My school also selects a few needy families each year around the holidays when a local group sends the school gift cards to the supermarket or Walmart to hand out to needy families, but the school can only hand things out to families they know are struggling so parents suffering in silence aren't going to receive anything. \n\nThere are also a ton of programs available to help with food insecurity if the parents are willing to apply for them. I know food banks may not have the safe foods the younger kids need but using food banks to feed the parents would free up money for the safe foods. Some grocery stores also offer discounts on fresh items that are closer to expiring. One of the grocery chains in my area partnered with an app called FlashFood where you can go on and see each store's discounted items, then place the order for what items you want and then you can pick them up all packaged and ready to go at the store with no one knowing that you used that app so there's no embarrassment.\n\nOP is definitely NTA but I would encourage him to try to save up money from his job because his parents are obviously overwhelmed and will be unable to help him financially if he decides to go to college or wants to get his own place once he turns 18.\n\nHonestly, I was an only child but we sometines struggled financially despite my Dad working all the overtime he could get. I always remember my mom once asking me at a grocery store for the money in my wallet because she didn't have enough cash, but I was young and gave her a hard time about \"my money\" and her paying me back. I feel horrible about it as an adult because it had to be embarrassing to have to ask your kid for their money to help buy food for the family, which I can appreciate now and really wish I'd just been less of a jerk about it and given her the money without making it a big deal. I'm honestly embarrassed of how I acted then, so while I think OP shouldn't be expected to feed the family from the money he earned, he may want to consider if there's some smaller way he could help his family out even non-monitarily, i.e. offering to help his Mom clean up after all the different meals she has to make. It's not fun but it would show your parents that you are trying to help them even though you aren't comfortable turning over your paycheck to them for family groceries.\n\nAlso highly suggest OP finds a support group or something because with all of the myriad of special needs in their family and the way his father expected his money from working to be used to provide safe foods for the younger siblings reeks of parentification. I volunteer with high schoolers in a lower income area and I always feel so bad for the students who have to work to get the money to allow them to participate in extracurricular activities because their families can't afford it.

It is not your responsibility to support the household. It is your parents responsibility to ensure everyone's needs are met and right now they're falling short. Whoever your siblings caseworker is should be able to help them figure out how to apply for benefits.

Are you buying more snacks and less healthy foods? Guess what I am saying it enjoying more isn't also a good thing in itself.

I think everyone here agrees they may be taking care of more ppl than they wish but it also didn't seem easy for them; \"take care of these kids or we're gonna send them to an adoption agency and they'll enjoy getting fucked over for their future\". \n\nYou don't have to feel that weight or burden and I hope you don't but I can also sympathize with your parents and while most redditors would jump out at a \"karma\" situation, I think until you get posed that question it's hard to really understand why ppl say yes knowing how bad of a quality of life it can potentially create at times. \n\nSo no, I don't think your an asshole but you di need to understand that when redditors here comment how \"by law they are obligated too\" or \"legally they must\", it's not a good position from an ethic or moral perspective.

But I'd also lay it out there that unless they really effed you over, really screwed you over, really cheated you out of something then sit back a bit and see it from their eyes. Yeah they now know they are struggling but there was a moment in their lives they were also given an unreasonable question to answer and they took the path thst ws hardest because they wanted to care for others who were family to them. It nay not mean the same to you and I feel that way based on how you wrote it but I hate to say they see the relationship differently and I'd gamble that what hurts them isn't the groceries but rather they feel they are 100% struggling in a way that they didn't before (and yeah everyone here affected by the pandemic has had thst issue) and they feel thst while they are struggling more and more you're kind of ignoring that. \n\nSometimes parents feel thst they struggle so much helping their kids that they hope they'll see and return that favor when they need it most.
