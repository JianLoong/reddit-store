I'm also the oldest in my family. I have four younger siblings. Two bio brothers who are on the spectrum and two sisters who are biologically my cousins and were adopted by my parents as babies. Both have Down Syndrome. All four of my younger siblings have significant challenges and health issues. Over the years it has drained my parents resources and left very little for anything fun. It was only when I started working two years ago that I could afford to treat myself occasionally. Sometimes it's my favorite gummies. Sometimes I save up to buy something. I bought myself a laptop earlier this year with my money because I needed something especially with school and everything and using the family computer didn't work as much now because dad works later in the days than he used to.\n\nFor the last few months I have paid for certain groceries for myself. Since there are so many different meals made in our house and I usually ended up with stuff I didn't really enjoy, I decided to occasionally buy in stuff so I could make myself something I'd like and it was one less person for my mom to prepare food for.\n\nMy brothers both have safe foods and my sisters are also bad eaters who have limitations due to allergies but also due to not enjoying the taste of a lot of things.\n\nI know my parents have been struggling to afford all the safe foods, allergen foods and then stuff for themselves. A while ago my dad asked if I could buy some family groceries for everyone and I sat and asked him if I could just get more of what I like for everyone and he said no. He and my mom don't like the foods I do. My siblings couldn't and wouldn't eat them. He said just get the usual stuff and I can live off of stuff I don't love. I told him I didn't want to do that. That I was trying to enjoy food more and it was one less person for them to buy for. We compromised and I would buy myself groceries all the time instead of sometimes.\n\nThen a couple of weeks ago some foods ran out and my dad had to use his credit card to buy a few extra groceries. I was the only person who didn't run out that week. My parents were pissed. They asked why I took care of myself so much but wouldn't help out with my family. Mom said it's exhausting having to feed so many different people with different needs and I could at least buy food for my siblings if I can't give a shit about her and dad. They said I was selfish and I should be thinking of my family over just me. My parents said I would probably let everyone starve before I help out and then they accused me of resenting them for adopting my sisters and adding more additional needs kids to our family. But they said that's what family does and I should be ashamed. They also said I should never have bought the laptop and could have helped out more financially without it.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697364334, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/178c86x/aita_for_not_using_the_money_i_earn_to_buy_family/", "score": 103, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Best place to start is the caseworker. If I was you I\u2019d contact dcf myself and explain exactly what you said, your family is struggling to make ends meet after adopting and pressuring you to provide. They won\u2019t be in trouble they\u2019ll be provided resources and help for all of you", "NTA\n\nYour parents are actually legally obligated to provide for you till you are 18 and they are not doing that.\n\nIt sounds as though they were doing okay... until you started earning money... okay your siblings probably eat more too because they are bigger and food is more expensive.  You are already helping them out by paying for your own food.  You also have provided your own laptop that your parents didn't have to pay for.\n\nYour dad either needs to find a higher paying job or utilise some of the services available for people with disabilities.  Do your siblings go to school?  The cousins with T21 would go to a disability school who hopefully provide food so that's one less meal a day they would need.  I would hope that these schools would be like public schools and there isn't big fees for them.\n\nWhat about your brothers?  Are they in school?\n\nYour parents may be eligible for disability payments to help support the younger kids too which would take a little bit of the pressure off.\n\nIt's not your responsibility to feed your siblings.  It's great that you offered to help but you are not obligated to.", "NTA\n\nYou are 16 and not responsible for your parents decisions, FFS", "NTA. You need the laptop for your education, don\u2019t feel guilty for that. Can you get in touch with a local food bank and get some supplies for your family? And I\u2019m sure an autism or downs charity would be able to try to help your family in some way to lessen the burden. Your parents are putting huge expectations on your shoulders at 16 to fix their problems as parents. It\u2019s their job to figure out how to care for so many people, not yours.", "NTA but your parents are. They can take their bleeding heart BS and shove it. They have a legal obligation to provide for you untill you are 18 and they are not even doing that. This is a form of neglect and would be illegal in most countries.  Its their job to raise you to have success in life, not just as a rescource for their pitty project. They chose to take on these responsiblities, its on them to deal with it. Yeah its hard but they chose to do a hard thing but they should have thought of that before they got started. No one forced them to have 3 kids, no one forced them to addopt 2 more.  They should just admit their failure and go to social services rather then drag you down with them. Because right now they are being the selfish and irresponsible ones. Yeah family helps thats what they do, but parents provide, thats what they do.\n\nIf they want more money they can get a job that pays better or work more hours. If you start not you will never get out of this. Even if you move out they will still be asking for your help", "NTA. You're providing for yourself. Surely you'd think that with resources spread thin there'd be gratitude on their part. You're demonstrating that you're capable of taking care of your needs and wants as a basic understanding of finances. What I as an adult appreciate is that you're cooking meals for yourself. That's an incredibly valuable life skill for any person.", "\"Cool story dad, but still against the law.\"\n\nYou can help if you want, which you _have offered to do_. You're not legally responsible for your siblings, that's your parents responsibility. \n\nAre they good people taking on more children? Perhaps.\n\nBut they have no right to offload their responsibilities on to you. You don't need to join in their suffering.\n\nThough you may want to hide your laptop,  they sound very resentful about it, and I don't know what type of people they are.\n\nNTA", "NTA. You\u2019re just a kid yourself, and they should be at least a little bit more grateful that you took the initiative to take some of the stress of caring for so many kids by taking care of yourself. The situation sucks, but it\u2019s not your fault and they shouldn\u2019t make you feel like it is.", "NTA. Honestly you are helping the family by being self efficent, buying food and other things. It cant be helped they wont eat what you buy or that its unlucky the other kids all have problems. I'm sure your parents are just stressed when they said those things, but it was super shitty of them. Just keep saving so you can get out when you turn 18, it shouldnt be your responsibility to take care of everyone (especially since they adopted 2 kids on top of what they already have, its a nice thing but it sounds like it came at a high cost)", "NTA. You started working when 14, now you're 16 and providing for yourself, maybe you could help a little bit more, but that's not on you, NOT YOUR DUTY. Your family was already in a dificult situation and your parents decided to adopt two special needs children despite all, they're the adults that made that decision, not you. I suggest you start saving as much money as possible to be able to live by yourself, you deserve some peace, and then maybe try to help your parents and siblings if possible,but  you have no legal obligations towards them, you deserve to live your life, not theirs.", "Oh sweetie. NTA but start saving money so you can move out asap. It\u2019s understandable that your family is struggling but it isn\u2019t your struggle. Good luck.", "NTA. Your dad's remark about the laptop has me worried though. If I were you, I'd take it with me wherever I go or find a safe place to hide it. Sounds a bit like he's preparing to make you sell it or do it himself.   \nAlso one question for better understanding: when your parents took in your cousins, were your brothers already born and diagnosed?", "Nah. \n\nAs noble as your parents are for taking on all these challenges, you made no such commitments. Your parents wanting you to help makes sense. You wanting not to makes sense.\n\nMove out asap!", "NTA. You\u2019re 16 and have been working to provide for yourself- that\u2019s helping more than enough. What they are asking is not your responsibility. They are being unfair and are straight up wrong for guilt tripping you. Sorry but they should be ashamed for how they handled that, not you.", "NTA. It\u2019s not your job to feed your siblings. That is your parents job. You offered a very reasonable compromise if buying your own food, which you should have to do.", "NTA\n\nI can understand your parents being angry because they are stressed, but the stress is from overextending themselves. 5 children is a lot. I don't know if your cousins were adopted before or after your brothers were born but if they were before your biological siblings, your parents shouldn't have gone through with two more pregnancies (not that your brothers are bad people or anything, but your parents just can't afford them). If after, I understand wanting to adopt them, but is there any extended family that could help with the situation?\n\nBut no matter what, the money you earn from your job is your money. Spending the money on a laptop is a good investment if it is really helping with your education. In college, a laptop is basically a necessity, so you have a headstart. In the future, if you want to help when the family is in a pinch, you could return excess food, and help buy food for the family, but you have no obligation to. Know that you are helping them, they just might not completely realize it since they are stressed from their situation.\n\nI would start saving money where you can though. Depending on the situation, you may want to look into moving out when you are 18+. When living on your own, an emergency fund is crucial (3 to 6 months worth of living expenses at minimum, that includes rent, groceries, utilities, toiletries, phone service, internet, insurance, and gas if you have a car, all this money you do not touch unless absolutely necessary). Also know, depending on the field you want to go into, college is not all it's cracked up to be. If you want to go into law, politics, STEM, econ, or business administration, it is necessary, but if it's blue collar work you want, trade school is a better investment. Anything in the arts is hard to get a well paying job (everywhere is hard, but art is especially hard), no matter the path you take, so college for art, in my opinion, is a scam.", "\nIt sounds like with these people if you give them an inch they'll take a mile! So be careful with any help you agree to give because one week they'll be happy with whatever you agree to do and the next week they'll be guilt tripping you about your computer again! Such BS!", "NTA you are already helping bye buying your own food and that is a lot of help!! You are still a child it is your parents responsibility to give you the basic needs not the other way around! If they are struggling there is assistance out there or other ways to get funding to take care of the family!!!", "NTA. If you live in the U.S., and your parents legally adopted your sisters, they might be receiving government assistance as part of the deal. Some kinship adoptions offer a monthly guardian or assistance monetary award, and even SNAP or WIC. They also might be receiving Social Security if one or both of your sisters' bio parents are deceased. It probably wouldn't cover the cost of their food and needs, but helps a lot.\n\nTell your parents that you cannot offer more help than you are at the moment. They sound like if they have their way, you will give them all your money, all the time. It's not a minor child's job to support their parents, ever.", "NTA \n\nThis is crazy they took in the extra kids and basically op has no issues so gets no say. I\u2019m starting to feel that my advice to kids in this situation should be if having an issue gives you a pass to get food that you want and extra support then every time dinner is served and you don\u2019t really want that food throw a tantrum. Hey it works for everyone else.", "NTA.\n\nMost of what I want to say has already been shared in other comments. \n\nI just wanted to add the following.\n\nI hope I don't come across as condescending but I admire your maturity, how you have strong and appropriate boundaries and a very healthy relationship with yourself!", "NTA, it's a sh\\*\\*y situation which I don't envy. TBPH, they're approach is off. It's way to accusational. They are the ones who stepped up to help your cousins, you didn't volunteer for that. They're so focused on the things they gave up they didn't realize you have also sacrificed a lot, but unlike them, you were not consulted about this sacrifice before hand. If I were you, I'd go talk to a Navy recruiter tomorrow. Go for a rate that gives you a security clearance, there are always jobs for people with a TS/SCI. TBPH, if things are that tight and your parents are not spending anything frivolously, I would chip in, even though they're being really manipulative about it.", "NTA.\nAlso, you started working at 14? Isn't that illegal?\nBut, depending on where you're from, you'll need to live there for 2 more years or so. The situation isn't going to get any better. You need to figure out either how you're going to make a horrible situation livable, or how you're going to develop your own coping mechanisms to shut them out.", "NTA but i would like you to consider the familys finances in the decision. Some familys, the only way people get fed is if everyone contributes. Others, its not needed. So please consider the familys needs.   \nIf your family does have money issues, maybe offer a % of your income to be your contribution. The % means if you dont work for a bit, you wont go into debt to this.   \nPersonally, dipping into a credit card for food isnt the point where i would ask a kid for food money. It would be after I have visited food pantys for myself and cannot afford the safe foods.", "This is a very hard one. I am going to have to go with NAH. You are definitely N T A OP. It's the responsibility of your parents to provide for their children at least until they turn 18. You are already taking care of yourself. I can understand your parents' situation too. They have unfortunately bit off more than what they can chew. They are N T A to ask you for help but they definitely will be if they continue to pester you about this.\nThere are many resources available for parents of disabilities. Your parents may want to go through them.", "INFO: Could you explain what 'on the spectrum' means? Not common language in my location. Additionally, the compromise was HOW long ago in weeks?", "Do you contribute to household expenses now you are working? I had a saturday job whilst I was at college and although it didn't amount to much I always paid a little to mum to help out. Anyway NTA, the other children aren't your responsibility, nor are your parents, you are still a child yourself. What happens to these disabled kids when your parents die out of interest? Watch out for being on the hook for that one.", "NTA I mean you COULD be a better son and offer them some free money every now and again so long as they don't start demanding it. A kid isn't parents free income, and you are not responsible for your siblings. In matter of fact there should be less groceries needed with you feeding yourself. Your old enough to sit your parents down and tell them you're buying your own food and it is one mouth they don't have to feed, if you have any free income you don't mind sharing, and  you rather not have them demand money. Also I would start squirreling away some money in plans on moving out when you are legally able in case", "Well if you're not gonna help when they need it you should not be living with them. Get your own place and then you're gonna see how it feels. Then you're gonna run out of food and need them to buy you some food.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I\u2019m sure there other resources, food banks, churches etc, that they can access.", "NTA Your parents should be feeding all of you including you and would get in trouble if you even told a teacher or cop that you have to buy food for yourself. Not only that but it's an incredibly generous act that you've agreed to buy all the groceries you need with your own money. Your parents are either not using all the services available to them, bad at budgeting, or need to work harder. You're already helping them well beyond the call of duty. Oh, and your mom definitely needs to work.", "YNTA.  I don't know where you are but with the variety of needs and the disabilities, do the four other kids not get SNAP benefits (in the US that is a credit card used from an account). I don't think you are being selfish at all.", "NTA... I'm worried that you paying for family groceries would become permanent.  Your parent are responsible for providing food for ALL their children. \n\nConsider that it is difficult for your parents to see different standards of living within the same household but the individuals in your family all have different dietary needs. \n\nThere are times that the entire family needs to chip in to avoid catastrophe (starving) but all other options including food banks should be looked into first.", "NTA You\u2019re 16.

Since the sisters are cousins, are there no parents/relatives to help out?", "[removed]", "NTA.  Your parents are essentially running a restaurant, with everyone ordering something different.  And they are forcing you to order off of their limited menu - one you do not enjoy.  Your parents should never have let things get like this.  If they want to continue to cater to 4 picky eaters then let them, you can take care of yourself.", "Yeah, my siblings all go to school. They get free school lunches but they don't often eat the lunches there due to what can be provided. I know that's another stress on my parents.", "> Your parents are actually legally obligated to provide for you till you are 18 and they are not doing that.\n\nOP's parents are in the wrong, despicable to ask him for money, and neglectful but it doesn't sound like they aren't providing for him, they just aren't feeding him his favorite foods.", "Strong opener lol. And I agree- a child should never have to worry about how they are going to provide for themselves, much less other people.

If op is buying foods that they like for themselves that is more than enough support for the parents.", "Really? He's 16 and has to buy his own food. In almost every country that would be considerd neglect and see the parents jailed.  His parents are just irresponsible and any breathing room you give people like this will just be wasted on taking on more challenges then they can handle.

The fact that you have to work outside your home just to feed yourself is a sign that they are failing to meet your needs. In fact, it seems your needs are coming dead last. \n\nThe part where you asked if it was ok to just buy more of the food you liked to help feed everyone,  and your dad said  \"no, that's not good enough,\" had me just seeing red. Your folks are just going to continue to offload their responsibilities onto you, and the chances of you being able to do anything to secure your own future will almost certainly end up burning away on the same altar.\n\nWhen someone is drowning,  the solution is not to drown with them.

Well hell, that makes them even more at fault for the mess they're in!", "I moved out at 16!", "They are turning to the wrong people to help. They shouldn't be mad at you. As others said, you are just a minor. They should be mad at your extended family for not helping. I assume there are plenty of adults in the extended family who could help, but don't. Your extended family didn't sign up to help, but family should help where they can.\n\nI know it kinda sounds like I am flipping the script, and I by no means mean to guilt you. The foster program in the US is garbage, especially for children with autism. I know that's what your parents are trying to avoid. Your parents have good hearts trying to save your cousins and brothers from that. While your extended family isn't obligated to help, it's sad to see that they don't have the same passion or financially can't either. You are exempt from helping out with your siblings and cousins because a) you are a minor, b) you can't support yourself, and c) you are helping them out by taking care of yourself.\n\nBest of luck to you!", "Is that even legal??", "I know.  My gut instinct is that same reaction.  I would never want a child of mine in harm's way.\n\nBut...\n\nThis is a kid with no resources who has a good work ethic and is trying to be responsible for himself.  (Actually, I forget.  Himself or herself?  Doesn't really matter in this case.)  In the U.S., the military is an option, possibly the only option, that can keep this young person fed, clothed, and housed, while training them, offering healthcare, and offering paths to higher education.\n\nGrampa was in WWII in the Phillipines. It was what responsible, patriotic young men did at the time.  He never talked about it.  I found out more much later in life.  My stepdad was in Vietnam.  Navy.  He didn't see live fire, as he was off the coast.  But those VA benefits certainly help now.  Three of my first cousins were Marines.  Two of them did really, really well with the skills they learned.  Like early retirement, vacation homes well.  It works out for some people.\n\nThe risks are terrifying and real.  But I wouldn't dismiss the option out of hand.  It absolutely sucks that one of the only options for a neglected minor to get ahead in the U\nS. is being used as a lab monkey and getting shot at.  But no one in power seems real concerned about the issue for obvious reasons.\n\nAnyway, OP is NTA for not wanting to be a co-parent to 4 kids with disabilities as a teenager.  \n\nOP could figure out whether his parents are availing themselves of assistance programs for kids with disabilities.  If OP has never seen case managers or therapists in the home, I'd guess not.  I don't know that CPS would help, but it's worth a try.  It's possible that 5 kids are not being served here.  When I hear \"allergies\" and restrictive eating behaviors and expensive foods in a house where they are asking a minor teenager to go above and beyond paying a lot of their own expenses into co-parenting, I have the desire to examine that situation more closely.  \n\nMy daughter has autism & ID.  She went through the \"white & crunchy\" food stage.  It was work to get her beyond it, and we still have to work to get protein into her.  We also tried the whole gluten-free/casein-free thing that was popular for a while.  But we could afford the trial, and we dropped it when it was obviously doing bugger-all to help.  OP's parents can't afford short-order chef cooking of expensive foods for 4 kids.  They need an OT's help to get beyond this.  And possibly, food assistance.\n\nGood luck, kid.  I wish you all the best in figuring this out.", "Then how long ago in weeks was the compromise regarding grocery shopping made before the blowup?", "NTA- they had months to adjust to the new dynamic. You had time for the same. They were spending elsewhere... And who asked them to adopt your cousin-siblings when money was that tight for that long? There should've been others ready to step up at the time", "NTA \nKeep saving and ensure that they won\u2019t be able to steal your savings.", "does not have to buy his own food, he just prefers different food to the others", "Right. They should pull themselves up by the bootstraps. How dare they be poor? Have they even tried not being poor? Let them eat cake! \n\nNo, most countries would not see them jailed. In fact, I think this is far more common than not. People don't always have money for food. They look to family members - including teenagers- for help. They take care of their own- just like his parents did for his cousins who have down syndrome. I don't think OP's parents sound like neglectful, bad people. They sound like loving people who are overwhelmed and underfunded.", "\"A kid isn't a parents free income\" please read the full sentence. It means that the money that a kid earns should never be expected to go straight into the house as an added income. While it's ok to expect to pay for some things, like food he wants to eat that can't be afforded, his parents shouldn't expect him to just hand it over. They can ask, but it shouldn't be expected.", "I'm very sorry to hear that. \nYou are in a really tough spot. Can you talk to a counsellor or trusted adult at school/work about your situation?", "He shouldn't but he is going above and beyond by removing  himself from their financial equation, but the parents are asking him to support the entire family which is too much.", "Others have mentioned programs and different assistances for them and yeah, there probably are things they don't already get.", "I'm already saving money. It's not a lot but it's something.", "My mom used to but because of all the additional needs my siblings have, she couldn't balance working and taking care of them. My sisters especially, get sick a lot and miss school frequently enough.\n\nI don't know about food banks or CPS helping families.", "I was 17.", "In the U.S., probably, we offer military training in our public high schools, and most don't blink an eye at it.", "They chose to. Nobody in the family wanted to keep the girls because of their diagnosis except for my parents. They were like we'll do it but had no family support when they did. The girls were a few weeks old when my parents brought them home and money had to be spent on the adoption process. But I don't know how much. I just remember my parents discussing the fees attached.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s commendable that OPs parents took on their cousins to save them from the system. \n\nBut, same as having kids, you shouldn\u2019t adopt them if you can\u2019t afford to cater to all their needs as parents.", "My bosses know what's going on at home. They're great. My school counselor could not be trusted with anything real or serious. But I do confide in my bosses sometimes.", "Uhhh yeah\u2026 I think you replied to the wrong comment brother. Hope you have a good day!", "Just keep telling them that it is not fair to put you dead last, even with the money that YOU work for at the age of 16. Your folks have already \"compromised \" by making you  100% responsible for feeding  yourself.  This is bullshit.  They need a sharp reality check.\n\n I am often critical of Reddit going for the nuclear option,  but it sounds as if a call to child protective services might be in order.", "OP, you need to be aware that this is only the start of the problem. Do your parents have plans for when they are too old to take care of your siblings? I strongly suspect their plan is You. They will expect you to take over financial and physical care for all four of your siblings - you need to be ready for this \u201cdiscussion\u201d, and have your own plan in place. It shouldn\u2019t be your responsibility to research, but if you don\u2019t do it then they won\u2019t. Start looking into the details of assisted living etc on your siblings behalf, make sure you know what support is available to them without you having to take them in yourself. \n\nI know you (probably) love them, but it was your parent\u2019s choice to give birth to two and adopt a further two - that does not mean you are obliged to dedicate your life to them. Don\u2019t forget, your siblings may outlive you even. Do you want to be sat at 80 year old, still doing all the physical care for four adult siblings who can\u2019t look after themselves?", "Also be sure you are saving money in an account they do not have access to. They already feel entitled to your earnings and there's too many horror stories of parents cleaning out their kids' accounts", "She can find something with flexible hours or a night time job once your dad is home.

Get out when you can, OP, and Save for it!", "I'm glad you have some adults in your corner.", "Then your school councillor shouldn\u2019t hold that position."]}
