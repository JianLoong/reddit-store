He asked respectfully, you responded respectfully. He understood that he couldn\u2019t force you not to drink, so he compromised by turning his back so he didn\u2019t have to watch you.

I'm Jewish, and this reminds me of Hasidic men making a fuss over sitting next to women on a plane, and that frustrates me so much, since jerks like this make Jews look bad.

If someone makes a polite request, you deny it, and they don't bother you about it, they are not being offensive.", "I could say the same to you, as there was no point in the story that the man in question asked for religious understanding. He asked to not be around alcohol. It's far more likely that he's just a brown-skinned man in recovery than your decision that he's a religious person personally oppressing you by politely asking a request and not pushing further.", "please seek therapy if hearing religious beliefs brought up is this triggering.\n\ni\u2019m not being snarky, if there\u2019s this strong reaction I hope you find healing for whatever you went through that causes it.", "Thank you! \n\nI was looking at another wiki page and it was super generic. It just said modest clothing that covers the naval to the knee. Where I'm from I doubt our Muslim population hits 1% lol so I really do NOT know. \ud83d\ude02", "Yeah I didn't see anything *yet* just general modesty. \n\n*For men at least, a hijab is a pretty big give away but Muslim women aren't the only ones who cover their hair it it could be confused with another religion. Technically Christian women should cover their hair but I guess they're backsliding*", "The request is a bit out of bounds though\u2014the drink was opened, it\u2019d be asking the OP to waste it.", "Well, congratulations!  You're wrong.  I find it offensive.  Other people find it offensive.  Keep your personal beliefs to yourself.\n\nYou have every right to do whatever you want.  If Zeus commands you to go anoint yourself in fulgurites, do it.  But don't expect *me* to do it.", "Same rule, different word.  Alcoholics don't have the right to ask other people to abide to their own drinking rules.  You have the right to do whatever you want with your own body.  Don't ask me not to do whatever I am within my legal rights to do with my own body.", "The user has a point though\u2014they\u2019re not religious so why do they need to abide by someone else\u2019s religious identity?", "Yeah, whenever someone says \"please seek therapy\" I *realllllyyy* believe they're being genuine and not snarky.\n\nKeep your religion to yourself.", "Something something abortion bans.", "If OP really only had a few stops left, they could just hold it. It doesn\u2019t go bad that quickly. I wouldn\u2019t have stopped drinking it either, but I don\u2019t see it as impolite to ask. If I were drinking something and the smell triggered an alcoholic, I don\u2019t think I have to stop, but it\u2019s not rude to ask me. It all depends on tone, too.", "I don\u2019t understand why that would be offensive to you, but I apologize. I try not to let it bother me, but I get that others like yourself may have undergone some religious trauma. Hopefully it doesn\u2019t weigh too heavily throughout your life.", "Yeah, those other people being polite members of society are such assholes. You stick it right to them! How terrible for people to believe that those around them might just be decent people, you'll sure show them. That's why you microwave fish in the office every day and loudly pop your gum when someone is speaking to you, because it's perfectly legal and you're exerting your rights.", "They don\u2019t! And didn\u2019t! \n\nA reasonable request, met by a reasonable response, and a reasonable outcome. :)", "I said nothing about my religion. \n\nI genuinely do wish you the best moving forward.\n\nHave a nice day, friend.", "Did you go back 40 days through my comment history to find a reply to a post in the Catholic subreddit where I said abortion should be legal, safe, and publicly funded?  \n\n\nBecause I literally made the same point as Lulu, and hold the same beliefs. Just because I don't like abortion doesn't mean it should be illegal. When my sister wanted one, I'm the one who paid the $780 for it."]}
