If you\u2019re in one of the more enclosed seats that just have a tray table I think it\u2019s kind of rude to drink if someone\u2019s next to you.

Idk wja6s wrong with that guy?! You're not the AH, he is a a little though", "I mean... he's not the asshole for asking.  He asked and didn't argue with you.  It takes nothing to be kind.  To me, he might of been struggling with something.  Which is his problem, but again, it's nit that big of a deal.", "Is he a Muslim, or is he a recovering alcoholic?

Check my post history if you\u2019re bored enough. \n\nWhat he did was akin to me going to a place where smoking is allowed and asking a smoker to put out their cigarette. Maybe\u2026I should work on being okay being in those places instead of putting the onus on other people, and in this way I can overcome addiction. Cause that\u2019s how im doing it. Smokers that decide to quit and expect everyone else to restructure according to them are typically entitled or immature. That\u2019s not how the world works. \n\nIn any case, if that wasn\u2019t enough to explain it to you, then I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll end up on the same page.
