It could have been something else such as he\u2019s a recovering alcoholic and didn\u2019t want to be near the smell/temptation. Either way, everyone was polite so no harm done.", "Definitely NTA. Someone's belief shouldn't affect another one. Everyone should keep their religious to their own. Moreover, as long as I understand you did look for another empty seat and didn't act in a rude way.", "NAH.  He\u2019s allowed to ask and you\u2019re allowed to decline.\n\nSounds like well-rounded adult behavior on both parts. Well done.", "Nah.

Some drink alcohol, some don\u2019t. The ones who don\u2019t still go to restaurants and work events with bars, and have conversations with people who are drinking. Nothing is Islam prohibits being in proximity to a stranger who is drinking alcohol.", "Nta. Dude needs to integrate", "NTA.  His religion only gets to guide his actions, not others around him.", "He asked politely, you refused politely, he didn\u2019t argue. It was okay for him to ask, but also okay for you to refuse. NAH", "NTA. You're in a public space, and legally permitted to drink. His religion can only dictate what he does, not you. \n\nI'm an exmormon, and reading this almost makes me laugh because I remember when I was an active, believing member that I would have been offended to see you drink and would have tried to get as far away from you as I could. It's ridiculous, what some of these strict religions do to people.\n\nI think I'll have a glass of wine tonight, lol.", "NTA and he's lying that's not even remotely true, nothing Haram about being in the presence of someone drinking alcohol, he was just uncomfortable.", "Small YTA. I think it\u2019s bad form to drink on the train or public transport in general.", "NAH. \n\nI don't understand the NTA. He asked. You refused. He didn't say anything afterwards. There was no conflict", "NAH. He politely asked you not to. You politely said no. End of story. Sounds like you both handled the situation well.", "NTA", "NTA - If it is legal to drink there then you are fine.  It isn't your fault his religion believes that.  I am not an expert, but I have actually never heard that Muslims can't be in the presence of alcohol, only that they don't drink so I am not sure he was even being completely honest with you.", "NAH", ">he says that he can\u2019t be in the presence of anyone drinking alcohol.\n\nNTA.  Why do you have to change your behavior to accommodate him? You aren't doing anything illegal.\n\nHe was trying to put responsibility for him adhering to his religion onto you. Totally inappropriate.  It's his conviction, his issue...if he doesn't like it, he can remove himself or turn his back (as he did).", "NAH He's allowed to ask and you're allowed to refuse.", "NAH. He asked. You said no.", "NTA. I\u2019m a Brit having tinnys on public transport is pretty standard for us so if the train allows it crack on", "NTA  \n\n\nhe can dictate his behavior with his relition, not yours", "NTA It\u2019s legal and your an adult.  Same thing if you were eating a bacon cheeseburger.", "NTA. I grew up in a Muslim country and no Muslim friend of mine ever had any issue with me eating during Ramadan. My Hindu friends don't mind that I order beef when I'm with them. \n\nThis isn't a \"Muslim\" issue, it's some guy being random and oppressive. Drink without fear Internet pal!", "NTA for drinking in the presence of people who oppose to drinking in general but it sounds like you have a very serious drinking problem if you feel like you need to drink on a train and can\u2019t even keep yourself from having a second one, on a very short trip no less.", "You're on public transport. Your behavior is apparently both legal and socially acceptable. His request is out of line. His religious scruples can't constrain your reasonable behavior.\n\n(Equally, it would be unreasonable for him to complain if you were a woman, because he has a religious issue with sitting next to a woman he's not related to. He couldn't ask you to stop being female, could he?)\n\nIf he doesn't want to sit next to a person having a beer on the train, he has the option to get up and stand.\n\nNTA", "I grew up Muslim. Some Muslims believe it\u2019s haram to even be in the presence of someone drinking. I don\u2019t believe there is anything in the Quran that says this. It just says drinking alcohol to intoxication is forbidden unless it is needed for medicinal purposes (say you\u2019re really injured or dying and in lots of pain)", "NAH, he asked which is fine, but you declined which is also fine.", "There's literally no conflict. He's very polite about it. Nah", "NTA. I'm a Muslim. While it's uncomfortable for him, it isn't haram for him to watch someone drink. You're in the clear.", "Lmao NTA. This is why I hate religion. Just because you are too weak willed to have an authentic thought in your head without being told how to think, does not mean you can TELL ME how to behave. Get the fuck out with that goddamn bullshit.", "NTA and he was lying, he can't drink alcohol, alcohol wouldn't be allowed in his home, but he can be around alcohol in public spaces where he is just present and not apart of it, like sitting an a bus next to a stranger.", "NAH, he asked, you said no, he didn't push further and tried to find his own way around his dilemma.", "NTA\n\nHe was out of line.\n\nIf he can\u2019t be in the presence of anyone drinking alcohol, he should stay home.", "NTA. No such thing as god or Allah or whatever but there definitely is such thing as beer. So fuck that guy", "Congratulations on your freedom \ud83d\udc95", "To be fair in British trains they often have a bit in one of the carriages where they sell food and drinks including alcohol and if you\u2019re lucky, there\u2019s a trolly that comes through that sells it. It\u2019s not generally bad form to drink alcohol where alcohol is served.", "It's worse form to try and impose your removed restrictions on others", "I think they can't go to a place that specifically serves alcohol, like a bar or a pub. I'm not completely sure I'm right, so correct me if I'm wrong.", "He\u2019s heading to a concert, probably trying to get some drinks in before he has to pay for overpriced ones there. If he was heading to work I\u2019d see you\u2019re point, but there is no reason he should have tried to keep himself from having a second one.", "What in your opinion constitutes a drinking problem/alcoholism?\n\nLegit question am interested due to your answer", "I mean I didn\u2019t feel like needed to, I just wanted to. And it was a half an hour long journey. But thanks for diagnosing me with a serious drinking problem for having two beers lol.", "Whether it's Haram or not for a stranger to see the OP drink  is independent of whether the behavior is acceptable.\n\nPublic behavior is governed by laws and social customs.  The stranger asked nicely for the person to stop drinking, the person politely declined the request.  Nothing wrong here.  Just my take on it.", "I wouldn't say he was out of line. Nothing wrong with politely asking, in the same was as their is nothing wrong with politely declining. Nobody's in the wrong here", "Thank you :)", "Ah never seen that, but if this train is like that then maybe it\u2019s ok.\n\nIn that case the situation is comparable to going into a restaurant and asking someone not to eat a certain animal as it\u2019s against their beliefs.", "That might be true, although it probably more of a traditional good practice but that doesn't change the fact that he is on public transit next to someone, not opening up a bar on the train.", "I do think he\u2019s NTA but drinking to beers on a 30 minute train ride doesn\u2019t indicate a very healthy relationship with alcohol. In my country people drink a lot but you wouldn\u2019t open a beer on a train (although I very much doubt it\u2019s illegal). It sounds very concerning to me but maybe that\u2019s just me.", "Drinking two beers in half an hour but especially drinking in your own in public kind of paints the picture. But the latter may just be because that\u2019s not done in my beer loving country.", "You do you do, but two units of alcohol in 30 minutes is problematic alcohol consumption by any standard.", "Idk if he added this bit in later but he put in parentheses that it's perfectly acceptable to drink on public transit where he's at. So yea your analogy is completely correct", "I don\u2019t think you need to start armchair analyzing this guy\u2019s relationship with alcohol based on incredibility limited information that \u201che drank two beers\u201d", "Ya it's just you", "In the UK its completely normal if you're on your way to a sporting event, concert, night out. It can be called pre-drinking and is often a way to save money.", "No it is not.", "It might be unhealthy but it's not problematic if it's every once in a while. Having a couple drinks before a concert seems totally normal. It's not like it's on his way to work or something that happens every day. Social drinking isn't always the smartest or healthiest, but most people can handle more than usual once in a while. Armchair diagnosing seems unhelpful here.", "Lol nerd"]}
