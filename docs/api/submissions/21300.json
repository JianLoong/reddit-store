Answer to your final question: no. You should not subject yourself to abuse from someone who couldn't respect a very simple and clear boundary. It's up to you but listen when people tell you how much they care about you. Your mom cares more about her BS \"family unity\". Sorry not all families get along, especially when one party is allowed to harass and disrespect others with no push back. She wants to be able to tell her family and friends that she has a big happy family and does not care that in order to achieve that she is choosing to stomp all over your boundaries and feelings. I understand wanting to bring your family together but attempting to do so under a LIE(she lied straight to your face and is saying you're the ahole, sounds like projection to me) is a perfect way to set up for failure.
