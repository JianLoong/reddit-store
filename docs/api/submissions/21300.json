Hopefully that will make it sink in.", "Well, if she ignores your sister-in-law\u2019s rude comments because she doesn\u2019t wanna take sides, but dislikes your husband, because he defends you she has , in fact taken, sides.

I\u2019ve spent decades putting up with this until I finally drew a hard line two years ago during an incident that she created and I went low contact.  When I tentatively reached out to her last summer, she crossed an even bigger line and I cut her off completely.\n\nIt\u2019s taken therapy for me to be able to let myself not feel guilty and more importantly, to keep me from falling back into the old pattern of caving in in order to keep the peace.  I have been well-conditioned, and so have you. My mom will be 87 in October and she\u2019s not going to change.  All I can change is my response.  I choose to live my life without the constant belittlement and criticism.  My mental and emotional health have been much stronger for it.  I highly recommend sitting down with a therapist for a few sessions.  Get validated by an outsider who can hear your entire story and talk you through your next course of action.\n\nNTA.

They tried the same thing of me 'making up ' with them blah blah blah\n\nI'm at the stage that now after 4years of practically no contact, I speak to my brother when I have to and just flat out ignore sil. I avoid going to my parents if they ever turn up. (Just an example of her behaviour eg she told everyone I was a prostitute, I beat her and called her names blah blah blah). \n\nI told my dad up to you to believe what you want but I don't have any time or mental capacity for their drama.

Let me back your hubby on this: *your mother is guilt tripping you again*. Stop going back. You already noticed how dumping those anchors in your life made you happy. Why crawl back in that boat? Habit? Ingrained training she pulled on you?

You should not put up with this one sided bullshit. I am so sick of peoples feelings being disregarded over \u201cfamily unity\u201d.

You had one boundary and she selfishly broke it, ignoring you like she always does. At this point it\u2019s on her to make amends, not you. You are done pleasing her.

She\u2019s done this seemingly all your life. This is a huge red flag. I know people on Reddit sometimes jump to no contact too quickly, but in  this situation, I would highly encourage going no contact with your mom and anyone else who\u2019s on her side. It will hurt at first (would recommend therapy to deal with this), but eventually it will feel better. The onus should be on your mother to make things right, and if she wants to she will.

Consider it an expensive lesson learned and if mom wants to see you, she can get her old toxic ass on a plane. My pop was flying till he was 93, only thing that stopped him was he died lol.
