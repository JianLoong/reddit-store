My uncle isn't even bringing his wife. We don't have another slot for her, and while we get along great, they weren't married while I was growing up, so she's not someone it's important to me is present at my wedding and she totally gets it and is fine with it. My brother has been dating his boyfriend for two years, and they might even get engaged soon. My brother wants to bring him to the wedding, but there isn't a spot.\n\nWe've been arguing about this for a while now. He says we should either not invite our two close friends (not an option, they are family to us) or my fiancee's sister because they have a contentious relationship anyway. Yeah, they have a weird relationship, but it's her *sister* and I can't uninvite *her* sister. Also, no one else is really going to have a \"date\" either. No one will be there with their spouses or partners (fiancee's parents are divorced). He would be the only one.\n\nHis argument is that his boyfriend is part of our family, which I agree with, but so is our uncle's wife. She isn't coming either and gets it. He says it's different for them because not inviting his boyfriend feels like a rejection of him and their relationship and identity. I'm sorry it feels that way, but it is what it is?

If your uncle can\u2019t bring his WIFE, then why would your brother think that he should be able to bring his boyfriend? \n\nMy only suggestion would be to make sure that your brother knows this is not about his relationship, it only has to do with the limited spots.", "NTA.  Your brother is prioritizing himself over you, your fiancee, and your other invited guests--both friends and relatives--who are not bringing their spouses/significant others. There are only ten spots for guests--and if other guest's SPOUSES are not invited, and no one has a problem with that, why would he think he gets to shove a guest out to make room for a mere boyfriend--not a spouse, mind you, just a boyfriend.\n\nImmature people always make other people's celebrations about themselves.  Your brother is one of those people.", "NTA. Your brother needs to stop being so selfish. Your wedding isn\u2019t about him and his boyfriend.", "NTA your brother is being pretty self centered. You have a hard limit. He's wanting to take people out of your wedding that are important to yall for someone who is important to him. It's not his day he needs to stop acting like it is. If he has such a problem with it he can pay the extra fees to include his boyfriend.", "NTA clearly you have invited the people who are the most important to you and know one else is making a fuss about the lack of plus 1. He is just throwing his toys out of the pram on this, stick to your guns.", "NTA. You have a restrictive guest list and it includes, excluding uncle but assume you are close, only immediate family and your (bride and groom's) two closest friends. You don't at the moment seem to have a close relationship with your brother's boyfriend so treating him as your uncle's wife seems sensible. And at moment, the guest list is balanced in your favour - seems unfair to to dominate it even more by excluding bride's friends in favour of more of the groom's family. \n\nI'd put the ball in his court by saying his boyfriend can come if he pays the difference. But you need to recognise he may not come at all. That's his right.", "NTA, it's not like his relationship is singled out for this. He's being unreasonable. It would be different if you had, say 20 guests and he was the only family member who didn't get a +1 but this isn't that case.", "Nah, NTA. I\u2019m gay, myself and I can clearly see that he\u2019s being a little dramatic about this. Especially if you\u2019ve confirmed that his boyfriend is basically a part of your family. If your brother wants to interpret it as being homophobic, that\u2019s his problem but very clearly not your intention", " NTA\n\nHave you spoken to his bf and explained why he\u2019s not invited?\n\nBrother might be feeling its a rejection of him/ his bf, but bf might just see the rationale. \n\nAs long as you and bf have always gotten along and there is no animosity, he should understand and help to calm your bro\u2019s thinking.", "NTA.  Seems like you are holding your brother to the same standard as everyone else and he is expecting special treatment because of his identity.", "NTA tell your brother he's uninvited as thats the only way to be fair and to show that you support them being together and then invite your uncles wife she at least is understanding of your situation and cared enough about your happiness to put her feelings aside for one day", "NTA. I understand he's hurt but like you said it not like anyone else is bringing their SO. Your brother is just being a tad bratty.\n\nEdit: maybe you could invite your brother and his boyfriend to brunch or something?", "NTA \n\nYour brother is being too insecure about this. \n\nCan you all have a get together another time or go out for dinner after with your uncle\u2019s wife and the rest of the family to celebrate?", "Your brother is weaponizing being gay to manipulate you about your wedding guest list. NTA.", "NTA uninvite the brother and invite his boyfriend", "Nta but this isn't gonna blow over easy i bet. Are you doing anything afterwards at a different location? Like after party reception dinner thing or anything where to could have the extra people come then? If not, is that financially an option?

Would you be willing g to let the boyfriend come if he pays his own fee for the extra person?", "NTA, but your brother is for trying to turn it into a thing about his sexual orientation.", "NTA, my SIL got married during the pandemic and had to have a very small guest list to meet requirements. Which mean my husband could go, but not me. It was disappointing, but I didn't take it personally because it wasn't about me. None of the spouses of their siblings were invited.\n\nYour brother is being overdramatic and trying to create issues were there aren't any. \n\nEnjoy your day!", "NTA, it's your wedding and you do what you like. He can choose not to come himself if he's not comfortable going alone. But seriously though, this wedding package deal seems awful. Having to exclude people that are close to you while paying a premium price? I'd be getting married elsewhere.", "NTA Your brother is treating this as if it his wedding and it isn't. Tell him no. If he throws a fit and decides he isn't coming, don't immediately fill his seat but give him a bit if you can to realize he's acting like an idiot", "So, I\u2019m gay, and I\u2019ve been on the receiving end of not having a +1 because of my sexuality. My husband and I got married at the height of the pandemic just before he deployed with the military. We had originally planned to have ~200 people there, but due to the pandemic we were restricted to 10, total, including church staff. \n\nThere were so many people we desperately wanted there, but couldn\u2019t. We did, however, livestream it - and in another couple anniversaries we will probably have a larger celebration where everyone can join in. \n\nMy point is, I understand where both of you are coming from - very well. No one is the asshole here. He needs to understand your constraints, and you need to find a way to affirm his relationship. \n\nWhat I would suggest is moving forward with your plan as is, but, when you get back to town have a larger celebration - even if it\u2019s just a potluck at someone\u2019s house - where everyone can celebrate with you, and your brother can see that his partner IS family, and gets treated as such.", "Your reasoning makes sense. You aren\u2019t singling anyone out. NTA.", "NTA. It's not like you're intentionally cutting him out. Ten guests is a very, very small list. Is your brother's SO one of the ten most important people in your life? I'm guessing not. The wedding is for you, not him. For a normal wedding, sure, it'd be rude to leave out a long-term SO, but this is a very different situation.", "NTA. Your wedding and you have limited space. It's not like you are excluding him because you are against the relationship. You simply don't have the space. He can always choose not to come and then you would have space for your aunt.", "NTA\n\nWhat the hell is it with people always expecting to go to weddings with their SO when there's simply no room/budget for it? If you can't spend a few hours with your immediate family without having your SO with you, you got bigger problems.", "NTA, but be prepared for some kind of petty revenge when his wedding comes along.", "NTA. Maybe take the brother and boyfriend to dinner, your treat, as a show that you love them?", "NTA he\u2019s being treated like everyone else and is just trying to guilt you into having his way. Cry me a river\u2026", "NTA. I\u2019d suggest at a certain point telling him that it is what it is. He can either come or not. If he chooses not, to please let you know since there are many other people far closer to you than his BF that you would have loved to invite.", "NTA. You're allowed to bring your two closest friends to your wedding and don't deserve to be questioned about the guest list when you can only invite 10 people! Your brother is being immature and unreasonable here.", "NTA - tell your brother he can stay home with his boyfriend and your aunt can have his spot. Problem solved", "NTA. The only solution at this point is to invite the boyfriend *instead of* your brother. Which, tbh, might be a more enjoyable night for you.", "Dude it\u2019s your wedding. Like, don\u2019t let other people have a say in YOUR WEDDING. They didn\u2019t pay for it, unless he\u2019s willing to offer money to cover his spot, he can just deal with it. It\u2019s one wedding, not the end of the world.", "NTA.", "Uninvite him and invite your uncle\u2019s wife instead.", "NTA,\n\nWith your venue being so exclusive,  could there be any chance he was planning on proposing or being proposed to, hence the BF absolutely must be there? You might be ruining his perfect plan (sarcasm). With how self centered hes being It's just something to think about before even giving him the option to pay for the extra guest, even as a bluff.\n\nI saw in the comments that you said there's another event the next day that everyone would be invited to. You might want to look out for him going plan B. Hope you and future Mrs have a blessed and dream day though!", "Tell your parents and your brother together: You have 10 guest max, that's your budget, the end. There are lots of people that would have been invited to a bigger day- boyfriend included- but this is a 10 person event and no one gets to tell you who those 10 people should be, or who is more deserving of a spot. Aunt is coming, she understands, and so excluding a boyfriend has nothing to do with identity or relationship, it has to do with selected the 10 people closest to you. \n\nThen be very clear, this isn't up for discussion, unless anyone wants to volunteer for the bigger package. Wait in awkward silence, then conclude with \"it is bordering on offensive you all telling my that the other people we have invited do not matter as much as someone else, and also questioning my \"acceptance\" and I'm not going to tolerate that. You know I love boyfriend, just like I love Aunt, and this has gotten to a place where you are intentionally hurting my feelings and it needs to stop. You can come or not, I would love to have you there, but the conversation is closed.\"\n\nNTA.", "NTA - Just have a party when you get home to invite others.", "NTA. I get it that your brother might feel that this is not just about his fiance, but also about his identity. But it seems that it isn't. Maybe have a dinner with him and his fiance to to talk it all out and explain it to both of them? Also, in a wedding the people close to both bride and bridgroom should be there. Your brother wants his bf included, and your wife to dismiss either someone of her side, or a shared friend. It's not OK.", "ESH\n\nIt's your wedding blah blah blah, we get that.\n\nHowever your wedding should be appealing for people to attend, as you're asking them to attend.\n\nYou've chosen to have a very restrictive wedding, it may be your dream wedding, however it doesn't suit your guests, so why should they attend?\n\nIf your brother didn't attend, how upset would you be?\n\nI think your brother is an AH for levelling those accusations at you and making it about that.", "NAH. He feels like you are rejecting who he is by not allowing him to bring his fiance-to-be. You feel like you are treating him equally to everyone else. You are both allowed to have those feelings. \n\nYou *could,* if you choose, ask him to help with the cost of increasing the attendance to include a +1 for everyone who wants one. But, of course, you are not required to.", "He's a student. No money.", "NTA OP\nYour brother is looking for an affirmation from his family that they accept who he is, and welcome his partner as equally as they would welcome anyone else's partner. People tend to think in binaries, and it's only natural that a refusal to give him that affirmation via a wedding invite must seem like a rejection. \n\nBUT here's what he's missing: your wedding isn't about him. Your guest list isn't a political statement. And most of all, he has no right to comment on how you prioritize a very limited guest list. Your decision is pragmatic and fiscally motivated, and he needs to accept that reality.", "This is perfect.", "Well, if brother doesn't come, then there's room for Uncle's wife!", "Yes, the day after the wedding we are all going to a local attraction and there is no limit on the number of people who come with us.", "He can't afford it. They're both college students.", "My wife has always dreamed of getting married at this location.", "I'm sorry that happened to you. Thank you for the excellent suggestion.", "I feel like you may be in a similar mindset as the brother. A wedding is for those getting married not the \"guest\", some people get married with no guest.", "Then he can shut up.", "Show him the comments here", "Gay guilt card is pretty fucked up of him, and whose to say that a two year relationship would last. Your friends are the ones who\u2019ve been there for you and truly want to be there for you at your wedding. The boyfriend can stay home and its for sure your brother pushing his own agenda to have his own selfish way. Do not give in! If he is petty and upset so be it, he is selfish and incompetent.", "You can still say it", "Then you are right. It is what it is.\nNTA.", "Or let the bride choose another friend.", "Best wishes for you guys if so! Make it a wonderful day. Hopefully you can clear out the issue with your brother in time.", "Also stream it if you can :) families who can\u2019t be there love that sort of thing", "If you choose to invite guests, it's not just about you any more.\n\nIf your only intention is for your guests to gawk at you while you stand up there and look pretty, I think you're selfish and an AH and it's not a wedding I would want to be at.\n\nA wedding is a celebration and while I do think the bride and groom come first, I do think there should be consideration for any one else attending.", "Immediate family is not the same tier as guests. And this party is exactly that.\n\nAnd they're there because of that exact reason. There isn't any \"guests\", just the wedding party itself. Arguably not even that.\n\nNobody here is attending as just a guest."]}
