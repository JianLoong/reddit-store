And at moment, the guest list is balanced in your favour - seems unfair to to dominate it even more by excluding bride's friends in favour of more of the groom's family. \n\nI'd put the ball in his court by saying his boyfriend can come if he pays the difference.

Your immediate family is your 5 the others are her choice. He gets 0 say in her side.", "NTA", "As your brother apparently can't go anywhere without bringing his bf, why not drop your brother from the guest list? Then you can invite your uncle's wife--she has more right to be there than your brother's bf, anyway.\n\nI'm gay myself, but I don't see this politically, as your brother does. I see it as your wedding, which is about you and your bride and those whom you want around you. Your brother is trying to turn it into a social-affirmation date. Her's also likely to make it unpleasant for everyone, getting on a high horse and complaining, etc. during the event.\n\nIt seems that every time there's a wedding on AITA, someone sees it as an opportunity to make trouble--a MIL who wants to fill it with her friends, an estranged relative, etc. It's your wedding, not your brother's.", "NTA, he's trying to force this as some kind of statement on his relationship when it's just about numbers. He needs to get over it or give up his spot for someone else!", "NTA.  I can't help but think he will take the opportunity to propose to his BF at your wedding.", "If other people could bring their partners, then you would be the ah. But since no one can, you brother should understand he is not entitled to bring his boyfriend. Unless he pays for it .  So, NTA", "Looks like you got room for 1 more. Either he is uninvited since he isn't happy with who you are inviting to your own wedding or he decides he doesn't want to go without his SO.", "NTA. Brother quite clearly is. If there's one thing I hate in this world, it's when someone gets told no and immediately tries to throw an \"ISM\" at the person who told them no.", "Nta your uncle isn't bringing his *wife*.  And she certainly takes priority over a boyfriend.   Tell him if he doesn't want to come that's fine. Then there will be a spot for wife!", "NTA. He says it's different for them because not inviting his boyfriend feels like a rejection of him and their relationship and identity.\u00a0 Your wedding isn't about his relationship or his identity, it's about you and your future spouses love. Not his, not him, not his identity. He sounds selfish and entitled. I'd give his spot to the understanding aunt.", "NTA\n\nTen is the hard limit and a very small number. You are choosing the people you are closest to (even if the relationship is weird, like your wife\u2019s with her sister). It\u2019s what happens with very small weddings; some folks aren\u2019t going to be included. It isn\u2019t a slight against your brother just like it isn\u2019t a slight against your aunt. \n\nI hope he chills out and sees this. It\u2019s not personal *against* anyone. It\u2019s just keeping your very closest folks close on an important day.", "NTA. Your brother is being unreasonable.  His BF is not part of the family.  (Hey, marriage equality.  If your brother wants to make him part of the family, he'll put a ring on it.)  And even if he were part of the family, some invitees aren't even bringing their spouses. So your brother's whining that this is a rejection of him and his identity and (wait for it, it's coming) homophobia don't hold water.  Not even a droplet.  Do not succumb to your brother's pressure, or your dad's caving to his complaints.  Your wedding, your guest list.  If your brother gets into a snit and refuses to come, it will open up a space for a more reasonable and supportive guest.", "NTA. If he continues to make a stink about it, uninvite him. He sounds entitled and playing the gay card is effed up.", "Uninvite him and let your Aunt go", "NTA lay down the law. Stop arguing and tell him he either accepts it or doesn\u2019t come.", "NTA, your brother doesn't want equal treatment, he wants to be treated special. Stand your ground now or this won't be the last time he will demand special treatment. Tell him you need to know now if he is going to attend or you will retract his invitation and ask someone who doesn't expect special treatment at your wedding.", "Your brother needs to realize it\u2019s your day. Your uncle cannot bring his wife. You decide the guest list. NTA", "NTA he's being treated the same as your straight uncle", "NTA. He can pay for the upgrade", "NTA. Since your Dad was so willing to toss out people on your guest list ask him if he\u2019s willing to give up his own spot. \n\nOR since it\u2019s your brothers bf that wants to come, he can pay the up charge. If he can\u2019t then \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA cut the drama and just not include your brother ....\n\nI mean he should understand the situation. I get the situation with the limited details provided.  It is what it is. He either comes alone or not at all.\n\nHe isn't special because he has a same sex relationship. His boyfriend doesn't mean more than your own aunt or other family member. He needs to get over himself. It's kind if ridiculous. They aren't even married. Why does he feel it makes sense to have someone you barely know over your best friend? Weird.", "Definitely NTA and pretty shitty of him try to guilt you with using the \u201cgay card\u201d!  That\u2019s has absolutely nothing to do with why his bf isn\u2019t invited! She\u2019s just trying to manipulate you. Tell him he can pay the extra money for you to be able to invite more guests. If he cant pay it, the. He needs to zip his mouth. Your wedding day is NOT about him and his bf!", "NTA. I doubt the brothers boyfriend really cares either tbh.", "And to play the cards he did was wrong. \n\nI'm not Catholic anymore, but a table of candles for guests to light in memory of those that couldn't come would be hilarious and fun. \n\nNTA.", "I honestly can\u2019t decide if YTA. I know that not inviting your sibling\u2019s SO will impact your relationship with them for the rest of your life and friends don\u2019t last forever (you are young enough that you don\u2019t get that yet. You will). Your decision.", "Or if he feels like his boyfriend being there is so important your brother could offer his spot to him.", "Why would he do that just for accommodating one person?", "This reminds me of the guy who posted earlier today, convinced that a wedding's \"no kids 5 or under\" rule directly targeted his 5 year old daughter because of her autism. Never mind that several other neurotypical 5 year olds could also not attend.", "Love your logic.  Might blow his mind tho", "This this this", "I'd bet good money it is. \ud83d\ude39\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude39"]}
