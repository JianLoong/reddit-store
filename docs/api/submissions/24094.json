It must be nice for him to have kids, a full time nanny, a financially contributing partner, and never have to do a single thing to maintain his home or raise his children. Tbh, you\u2019re kind of the AH if you keep doing this. You both work full time, everything with the household should be split 50/50. Stop accepting less. Make a list of everything you do, sit in front of him with a highlighter and highlight each thing you will no longer do under any circumstances. If he tries to argue, hand him the list and walk away. Honestly, I would just leave, but if you care about fixing this, you need to be very very clear and stick to it.", "NTA.\n\nThe question here should be why are you still with that asshole ? You're basically a free nanny and maid for a man who doesn't seem to want to be a parent or even spend time alone with his own kid. \n\nI'd say it's about time to be single again.", "NTA HE is the one who clearly doesn't want her and she's going to notice if she hasn't already", "NTA - Sounds like he got married for free babysitting. Hard pass.", "No but why are with him?", "NTA. Your husband is. Watch the documentary on Hulu called Fair Play and see exactly how you\u2019re being taken advantage of. Working from home is still working and deserves your attention. He needs to step up or be kicked to the curb. Women don\u2019t need to live this way, and they don\u2019t deserve to.", "NTA. You're not just his slave: you're a slave who pays rent.\n\nHe has been exploiting you all this time for free childcare, cooking, laundry, etc..\n\nForce him to change this now or call a divorce lawyer.", "NTA no wonder your husband is divorced. He puts all the labor of the household and child raising on whatever woman he happens to be with. I think you put up with this for 8 years too long OP, but it's never too late to make changes. You deserve better.", "NTA. Your husband is using you as the babysitter, maid, and cook all while you contribute financially to the household as well.  He's got a great life!  No responsibilities toward his family other than what he feels like doing.  Sign me up!", "NTA\n\nBut why put up with this? He's clearly taking advantage of you and that's why he flipped out/flipped the blame.\n\nYou know you're not the a-hole here. The real question is how you're going to set boundaries going forward.", "You do realize you are only his free nanny, right? NTA. And you should run."]}
