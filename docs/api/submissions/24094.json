It must be nice for him to have kids, a full time nanny, a financially contributing partner, and never have to do a single thing to maintain his home or raise his children. Tbh, you\u2019re kind of the AH if you keep doing this. You both work full time, everything with the household should be split 50/50. Stop accepting less. Make a list of everything you do, sit in front of him with a highlighter and highlight each thing you will no longer do under any circumstances. If he tries to argue, hand him the list and walk away. Honestly, I would just leave, but if you care about fixing this, you need to be very very clear and stick to it.", "NTA.\n\nThe question here should be why are you still with that asshole ? You're basically a free nanny and maid for a man who doesn't seem to want to be a parent or even spend time alone with his own kid. \n\nI'd say it's about time to be single again.", "NTA HE is the one who clearly doesn't want her and she's going to notice if she hasn't already", "NTA - Sounds like he got married for free babysitting. Hard pass.", "No but why are with him?", "NTA. Your husband is. Watch the documentary on Hulu called Fair Play and see exactly how you\u2019re being taken advantage of. Working from home is still working and deserves your attention. He needs to step up or be kicked to the curb. Women don\u2019t need to live this way, and they don\u2019t deserve to.", "NTA. You're not just his slave: you're a slave who pays rent.\n\nHe has been exploiting you all this time for free childcare, cooking, laundry, etc..\n\nForce him to change this now or call a divorce lawyer.", "NTA no wonder your husband is divorced. He puts all the labor of the household and child raising on whatever woman he happens to be with. I think you put up with this for 8 years too long OP, but it's never too late to make changes. You deserve better.", "NTA. Your husband is using you as the babysitter, maid, and cook all while you contribute financially to the household as well.  He's got a great life!  No responsibilities toward his family other than what he feels like doing.  Sign me up!", "NTA\n\nBut why put up with this?

He's angry because his mother taking his daughter means he can't be guiltfree when he goes out, now he's imposing on his *mother*.\n\nHe isn't acting like a *partner*, he's acting like a person with a nanny, a maid, and expensive hobbies.

He is quite the hypocrite telling you he knows YOU dont want her there when he has not shown one single bit of interest in being responsible for his daughter or.in spending time with her.\n\nYou have tolerated this much longer than i would have.  There is no way i would rush myself around continually to get a child up  and ready for school (and all associated headaches) while her LAZY NEGLECTFUL father  sleeps another 3-4 hrs.\n\nSounds like you work full time and he works part time.  Sounds like you may be the primary breadwinner and.his income is secondary. Sounds like you are primarily responsible for his daughter when she is over.  If my understanding is correct, what is he contributing to your life to make you take on all the heavy lifting while he skates by on getting up at 11am working part time and pushing his parental responsibilities off on you.\n\nIf you can support yourself and your children without him being there,  your life would be much easier without an additional girl child and an additional man.child.", "NTA, sounds like your husband treats you like a nanny for his kid and not a partner in life. \nI think you guys need a serious conversation about new expectations moving forward.", "NTA and maybe look up this subs references to \"bang maid\".", "NTA he's a terrible father.    \n\nWhat do you see in this guy ?    \n\nAre you his unpaid help/nanny/maid.", "NTA but I feel bad for his daughter the most in this situation and whatever you do, try and keep her from feeling like any of this is her fault.\n\nI'd recommend working your way out of this relationship.

And if not, you at least know what you need for yourself as you move forward.", "NTA- but why are you doing this to yourself?

So why doesn\u2019t he want her? And his taking advantage of you. If he feels that\u2019s strongly about it I would stop watching his child all together. Just say \u201cI work full time from home and you try to pretend that I don\u2019t work and throw every responsibility on me. And I am tired of being used so things are going to change.

And I'm sorry to break it to you, but he is using you. \n\nAnd the fact that he said that \"I know YOU don't want her\"...OP, please have a good think. He's trying to manipulate you while he's doing the bare minimum as a parent. Do you really want to live the rest of your life like this?", "NTA\n\nHe is shirking his parental duties. Does the mother know he\u2019s leaving their child with you while he goes on vacation? This could blow up in a terrible way if anything should happen to the child.

I know it's hard taking a stand but please grow up a spine. Put the foot down.", "Why did you marry him? His kid is meant to be part of your family now, Edit\\~ there's two separate issues here, one is what You erote about your stepdaughter the other is about having to do all the housework. in my opinion when you marry, that child should be treated like your Own. There are plenty of mothers who work from home and get disturbed by their children, you made that choice when you married him. The other issue is something you need to bring up with him and say that you're fed up of being lumped with all the housework which is fair enough. ESH", "NTA \n\nSounds like you're doing all the work. You definitely sound like you feel all the work is on you. Will you still feel and look at him the same as you do now if nothing changes? \n\nHealthy relationships are healthy only when both parties feel equal. Not tracking each duty, but an equal contribution to all the little things that make a life. When you feel like you are always picking up the slack for someone and don't feel appreciated, that causes resentment. You don't feel respected. And when you point out the issue and that someone puts the blame on you, you have a problem. Because they do not see theirself as the problem.", "\"They have no kids of their own.\" Thank God,  he seems like a shitty father.", "I'm a little surprised that this isn't an age gap sorry, 'cause it looks like he just wanted a nanny.", "Exactly.  SHe is 100% being used.", "Can't tell if OP is the bang-maid or the bang-nanny, but she is NTA,\n\nThe husband is completely an A. OP should seriously reconsider this relationship.\n\nHe's throwing her under the bus, blaming her for his failings. What does he bring to the relationship?", "His custody time was awarded so that he could maintain a positive relationship with his daughter. He's not doing that if he's not around.", "But the husband knew for two weeks, it\u2019s not last minute. OP should have direct communication with bio mom if husband plays stupid ( ie lies through his teeth)", "Thank you, everyone for your validation. \n\nHe's not all bad, but clearly has some of his priorities out of order. And, I myself am surely not perfect. There are areas I can be better too but I have enabled this behavior and allowed it.  But only because I don't want to see his daughter suffer being late to school or anything because it's not her fault. \n\nWe both contribute financially for household and kids. And I know he loves me and the kids but doesn't always know how to show it properly. There have also been (minimal) occasions when he has had to have the kids because of my work with no issues from him. But never because of pleasure on my end.\n\nI just feel it's a lot different if there is a legitimate reason like work, illness, etc. vs. playdates with your friends. If he wasn't able to take her to work, I wouldn't have a problem keeping her. Too sick, don't worry, I got this. But over sleeping, golf and lunches have pushed me to the edge. \n\nI'm taking some of your advise and have made a list of boundaries/expectations as a couple and as parents. I'm drawing a hard line and not enabling anymore. Sadly, I'm not hopeful but I have to try. And if it doesn't work, then the inevitable may need to happen.", "I\u2019m curious why he doesn\u2019t try and swap days with the mom. Most custody agreements say that the parents get first choice before sending them off to someone else. It\u2019s done this way to protect the child.", "Nta.  My husband doesn't even grab a drink with a friend without asking me first if I'm cool being alone with the kids, and I treat him the same way.  I feel like that's common courtesy.", "NTA. If he won't step up, it time for him to hire a nanny and a maid to cover his share of the chores.", "NTA. He's really got it made hasn't he?

He\u2019s TA too, but for leaving his daughter with someone who counts every single thing they do for a child.", "I'm going with ESH. Your husband is no doubt the AH in this situation, and just generally, but the fact that you call her \"his\" daughter after 8.5 years is also AHly. You shouldn't be the only one caring for your children, but you should acknowledge that they are both your children, not your child and his child. You and your daughters both deserve better.", "Sad for the kid that both adults don\u2019t want to have to be bothered with.

Your employer would probably not be pleased to learn they\u2019re paying you to be basically a SAHM. When I worked from home there were some very clear expectations that we weren\u2019t doing more than maybe throwing in an occasional load of laundry. You\u2019re AT WORK, which your husband refuses to acknowledge.\n\nWhat\u2019s the upside of being married to this guy?", "NTA, and I'm really failing to see what your husband brings to your marriage.  He neglects you, the housework and his own children. From now on, he is responsible for most, if not all, of his child's needs. If he's unwilling to do that,  I would consider the point of continuing this relationship.", "NTA, but you've been dealing with this for 'years'? ...why?!", "YTA because you are a doormat and letting him use you.", "NTA.\n\nBut you have to speak up for yourself. Sounds like you've been keeping your frustrations in and just hinting around the core issue. You have your hands full with work, childcare, and maintaining the home. He needs to contribute and you have every right to voice your concerns honestly.", "NTA I would wake him up with an air horn and NOT take his kid to school", "NTA, sounds like you're rightly fed up. Reminds me about the fact that everyone suffers when no care work is being done and how men regularly shunt it on to women. He's ridiculously selfish and he either needs to parent up or relinquish custody to his ex.", "NTA.  It seems he married you to have a live in babysitter.", "Your only teaching your child that it's okay to let others take advantage of you.\n\nNTA but you need to grow a spine.", "NTA and I hate to say this but ma\u2019am you\u2019re a free babysitter in his eyes \ud83d\ude43", "NTA you do realize that you are just the bang-maid and Not his wife in his mind right?", "INFO: Why are you married to this guy, again?", "NTA.\n\nHe sounds like a catch\u2026.said no one ever (except maybe you). \n\nHe has managed to skimp out on being a father to his daughter.", "just stop doing everything. it's completely unfair and he is absolutely unreasonable.\n\ni'd leave if i were you. you're being used and emotionally manipulated.\n\nNTA.", "NTA\n\nIt is his daughter and he is always planning trips away for when he has time with her? HE evidently doesnt want time with her. I would consider that if he is anywhere near close to 50/50 custody, it is likely to avoid child support obligations and not because he adores his child. \n\nGetting married kinda put you in a tough spot. You have some big decisions to make here. I don't doubt that you like her. I think he just doesn't parent so you became a parent by default. Her mother probably misses her like crazy and she probably misses her mother just to be with her dads wife because he is never around. That must be tough for her. \n\nIf he wants time with his daughter, he needs to actually spend it with her. You are doing what is best for you AND the daughter. \n\nI can imagine his ex felt like a single parent too. \n\nCouples counselling or he can hire a nanny. Otherwise, not sure what you are getting from this relationship, but maybe consider he tried to use a child against you so he wouldnt have to care for his own flesh and blood. Toxic. Yuck. I don't think I could stay in love with a man who treated his child and partner that way because I would lose a lot of respect for them. But that is just me.", "ESH. Someone is keeping score and the other is sleeping in. That poor girl is all I can say.", "NTA. We don\u2019t need more context, but the fact that you state that more context exists makes me think the actual situation is even worse. Any men who are wondering why women are collectively asking for divorces more often and wanting to get married less and less should just spend an hour browsing this sub. Everything will become clear.", "Info- how old is his daughter?  You guys have been together for 8.5 years, so I would assume she\u2019s at least nine. Barring special needs, she should be capable of minding an alarm clock, getting dressed, fixing herself breakfast and lunch, and even her own laundry.  I\u2019m confused why caring for her is such an intense job. She\u2019s halfway to adulthood.

And everything else.\n\nHow many hours does he work when he works?  It sounds like you have a full schedule.\n\nI don't think expecting him to take his daughter to work with him is really viable, necessarily.  Sure, he *can*, and sure, the home is your workspace.  But.... there's a lot more ways for a kid to entertain themselves at home than at someone's work, so they're definitely going to be a bigger distraction.  It might be a \"once-in-a-while\" thing, but not as a permanent solution.  If she's that disruptive to your work, then y'all need to figure out childcare of some sort for her, either in the home or not.\n\nAt the minimum, it needs to not be your assumed duty to watch his daughter.  Even if it was your kid, you don't just say \"I'm bailing, you take care of the kid\" without talking to your spouse.  You just fucking don't.

Get into therapy so you can understand why you have been doing this for so long (you aren\u2019t alone) and how to start to set up boundaries.  Goal should be he coparents with.

He wants a mom, nanny, maid, and wife all rolled into one (just like the vast majority of men on the planet). The fact that he doesn't even care enough about his daughter to spend the minimal amount of time with her is telling.

Kids require attention and love, which they get. You are missing the point. I don't have an issue with caring for the children.

The leaving you with the kids is just the tip of it.  Like, if he actually put in the time that you do, and took on his share of stuff, and contributed even remotely proportionately, and actually talked to you about the kid watching, I'd bet that it wouldn't bother you 10% as much, if at all.\n\nY'all need counseling.

What I don\u2019t get is why your mad at op and not more mad at dad for neglecting to do his job as a parent. If he was an involved partner and parent then this problem wouldn\u2019t be happening. The husband would be the one to plan all his child\u2019s activities and know her day to day schedule. So the only one to blame here is the husband for not being more involved in his child\u2019s life whom he doesn\u2019t always get to see. You would think since he didn\u2019t se her everyday he would want to be a better and more involved parent so he would actually bond with his child.", "Are youbtoona man who pushes all chores on your wife andcthen act surprisedcwhennresentment builds up?
