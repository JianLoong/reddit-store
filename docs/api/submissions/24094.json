It must be nice for him to have kids, a full time nanny, a financially contributing partner, and never have to do a single thing to maintain his home or raise his children. Tbh, you\u2019re kind of the AH if you keep doing this. You both work full time, everything with the household should be split 50/50. Stop accepting less. Make a list of everything you do, sit in front of him with a highlighter and highlight each thing you will no longer do under any circumstances. If he tries to argue, hand him the list and walk away. Honestly, I would just leave, but if you care about fixing this, you need to be very very clear and stick to it.", "NTA.\n\nThe question here should be why are you still with that asshole ? You're basically a free nanny and maid for a man who doesn't seem to want to be a parent or even spend time alone with his own kid. \n\nI'd say it's about time to be single again.", "NTA HE is the one who clearly doesn't want her and she's going to notice if she hasn't already", "NTA - Sounds like he got married for free babysitting. Hard pass.", "No but why are with him?", "NTA. Your husband is. Watch the documentary on Hulu called Fair Play and see exactly how you\u2019re being taken advantage of. Working from home is still working and deserves your attention. He needs to step up or be kicked to the curb. Women don\u2019t need to live this way, and they don\u2019t deserve to.", "NTA. You're not just his slave: you're a slave who pays rent.\n\nHe has been exploiting you all this time for free childcare, cooking, laundry, etc..\n\nForce him to change this now or call a divorce lawyer.", "NTA no wonder your husband is divorced. He puts all the labor of the household and child raising on whatever woman he happens to be with. I think you put up with this for 8 years too long OP, but it's never too late to make changes. You deserve better.", "NTA. Your husband is using you as the babysitter, maid, and cook all while you contribute financially to the household as well.  He's got a great life!  No responsibilities toward his family other than what he feels like doing.  Sign me up!", "NTA\n\nBut why put up with this? He's clearly taking advantage of you and that's why he flipped out/flipped the blame.\n\nYou know you're not the a-hole here. The real question is how you're going to set boundaries going forward.", "You do realize you are only his free nanny, right? NTA. And you should run.", "Nta why are you with him. He's taking advantage of you", "NTA.  My mans literally pulled the \"YOU dont want her\" when it's obvious he doesn't. Blended families can be rough, but you're just a nanny with benefits at this point to him.", "NTA. He's lying to you to attempt to manipulate you into feeling guilty (and therefore complying). He wants you to take care of his responsibilities because he thinks that you being at home means he's free to leave, and because he thinks that your reproductive organs being on the inside makes you the default caretaker. He's angry because his mother taking his daughter means he can't be guiltfree when he goes out, now he's imposing on his *mother*.\n\nHe isn't acting like a *partner*, he's acting like a person with a nanny, a maid, and expensive hobbies. He's acting like a man without a family.", "you\u2019re his maid/nanny, leave his ass! NTA", "NTA\n\nYou deserve a true partner.  You are being treated badly by your husband and he is also neglecting his daughter and expects you to get his child ready for school while he sleeps in until 10-11 and starts work at noon?    \n\nPlease please do yourself a favor and establish some very strong boundaries regarding care and responsibility for his daughter.  He is quite the hypocrite telling you he knows YOU dont want her there when he has not shown one single bit of interest in being responsible for his daughter or.in spending time with her.\n\nYou have tolerated this much longer than i would have.  There is no way i would rush myself around continually to get a child up  and ready for school (and all associated headaches) while her LAZY NEGLECTFUL father  sleeps another 3-4 hrs.\n\nSounds like you work full time and he works part time.  Sounds like you may be the primary breadwinner and.his income is secondary. Sounds like you are primarily responsible for his daughter when she is over.  If my understanding is correct, what is he contributing to your life to make you take on all the heavy lifting while he skates by on getting up at 11am working part time and pushing his parental responsibilities off on you.\n\nIf you can support yourself and your children without him being there,  your life would be much easier without an additional girl child and an additional man.child.", "NTA, sounds like your husband treats you like a nanny for his kid and not a partner in life. \nI think you guys need a serious conversation about new expectations moving forward.", "NTA and maybe look up this subs references to \"bang maid\".", "NTA he's a terrible father.    \n\nWhat do you see in this guy ?    \n\nAre you his unpaid help/nanny/maid.", "NTA but I feel bad for his daughter the most in this situation and whatever you do, try and keep her from feeling like any of this is her fault.\n\nI'd recommend working your way out of this relationship.  He's abusing you and ignoring his own daughter.  It's not going to get better unless he agrees to make changes in his comfortable way of living that puts the majority of the work on you.", "NTA. You're not a bang maid, you're an actual person. I don't know how people can stand to be with someone who treats them like that.", "NTA\n\nOP you need to make some changes if you intend to continue with this marriage.  Your spouse is walking all over you and taking for granted how much you contribute.\n\nPlease take some time to figure out what you need and how to make those changes.  Figure out what boundaries you can put into place.  And how to make your life more functional.  Your husband can figure out how to adjust to those changes on his terms.  Hopefully, you both find a way to make the relationship happier and healthier.  And if not, you at least know what you need for yourself as you move forward.", "NTA- but why are you doing this to yourself? You are in a relationship where your partner contributes nothing, neglects his daughter, and then is nasty to you when called out on his poor behaviour. \n\nYou take care of the girls, the house and work full time. What do you need him for?", "So you're his cook,maid,cleaner,nanny,laundry person and give rent too? What does he do? Like what? \n\nNTA but why are you with this child? He doesn't need a wife he needs a MOMMY who'll do everything except maybe wipe his ass for him!", "ESH. They are using you and you've allowed them to build a reliance on using you. You've contributed to their misuse of you. \n\nBig picture, you're NTA: They're using you. For this instance, ESH because you're clearly the childcare resource and standing your ground now is the change they weren't expecting.", "Why are you with this man?  Or you really ok being the one doing all the adulting?  NTA. Refuse to keep her if he\u2019s not there.  His visitation is so he can have a relationship with his daughter, not so he can push her off on you.", "NTA. And I bet it\u2019s 50/50 custody so he doesn\u2019t have to pay child support right???  He\u2019s playing you (and most likely the divorce system) like a fiddle.", "I would communicate with his co-parent. Tell her her Dad isn't around on those dates, and advise her her co-parent isn't using his custody dates to spend much time with his kid. Maybe it's best you two live in separate houses? You can be married and live apart. NTA", "NTA. Make a list of everything you are doing - cook, child care, house cleaning, chauffeur, and list the weekly/monthly costs for those & give him an invoice.\n\nSeriously think about your future - do you really want to live with this for the rest of your life?", "NTA stop doing everything for him make him get up an take care of his kid, but make sure you sit his kids down to let them know why you're not taking care of them and that it's beyond their dad and not them. Your husband seems like he's only with you so he doesn't have to adult", "NTA-  he is dumping his emotional and scheduling responsibilities onto you.   He is a parent but acting like a teenager.  \n\nHe is also punishing you when you point it out and push back any little bit.  \n\nDo with this information what you will.", "Nta, don't let yourself get used any longer as free babysitter.", "NTA. You deserve better", "NTA. You know he's using you. The question is what are you going to do about it?", "NTA \u201cMy husband is blatantly manipulating me, AITA for being angry at it now that I\u2019ve confirmed it?\u201d", "NTA.\n\nAlso, leave him", "NTA. Ditch the deadbeat.", "NTA. He has been showing you all along who he is. Time to start believing him.", "NTA!  Girl i agree with what everyone is saying, at this point get a divorce or set some ground rules. Otherwise this is gonna continue on \u2026.", "Nta. But I think you should go have a work meeting at a coffee shop from 6am till 9 and let him deal with kids", "What does he bring to the table ?\nHe doesn't seem to even care about his own daughter , he doesn't help with the house or seem to care about you . It feels like you're his mother instead of his partner . \n\nI don't usually tell ppl to get divorced but I don't really see what's he's good for .", "NTA, and your husbands response is straight up gaslighting, since you\u2019d already told him why you wanted her to stay with her mother.  Were I in your position, I\u2019d make it very clear to him what your expectations are vis-a-vis his daughter moving forward, and *stick to them*.  Otherwise he will continue to take advantage of you.", "You deserve a better partner! If he throws you under the bus for asking him to parent HIS own kid. He has problems! Take care of yourself. Your Not The Ass for saying what you said OR for feeling like you do. NTA", "Nta. Wait he told you \u201cyou didn\u2019t want her\u201d? He does realize that\u2019s his child right? So why doesn\u2019t he want her? And his taking advantage of you. If he feels that\u2019s strongly about it I would stop watching his child all together. Just say \u201cI work full time from home and you try to pretend that I don\u2019t work and throw every responsibility on me. And I am tired of being used so things are going to change. (And give him a list of chores. Like one day you cook dinner and he does the dishes. If he doesn\u2019t the next day your not cooking for him or his child) you live here too and it\u2019s time you started acting like it. So now half the chores are yours. And I love your daughter but she\u2019s your responsibility I will not be doing anymore childcare for her. You need someone to watch her hire a sitter or tell\nHer mom you can\u2019t do it those days. If you have enough time and money to do things like golf and go on guys trips you have the money for a sitter and time to help out at home\u201d", "NTA, but stop with the \u201cI have to do\u201d this and that. You are choosing to do these things. He can get up and get his daughter to school. He can do half of the household chores. He chooses to let you do it all, and why should that change? It\u2019s working for him.", "NTA, I'd make the mother aware that your husband has been dipping every time he's supposed to have custody.", "NTA. And I'm sorry to break it to you, but he is using you. \n\nAnd the fact that he said that \"I know YOU don't want her\"...OP, please have a good think. He's trying to manipulate you while he's doing the bare minimum as a parent. Do you really want to live the rest of your life like this?", "NTA\n\nHe is shirking his parental duties. Does the mother know he\u2019s leaving their child with you while he goes on vacation? This could blow up in a terrible way if anything should happen to the child. It\u2019s also horribly disrespectful to you and his child.", "Tell him: either take care of your own kid or I\u2019m calling your ex to come get her.", "NTA. \nWow, why do you let yourself be treated like that? I know it's hard taking a stand but please grow up a spine. Put the foot down.", "Why did you marry him? His kid is meant to be part of your family now,", "NTA \n\nSounds like you're doing all the work. You definitely sound like you feel all the work is on you. Will you still feel and look at him the same as you do now if nothing changes? \n\nHealthy relationships are healthy only when both parties feel equal. Not tracking each duty, but an equal contribution to all the little things that make a life. When you feel like you are always picking up the slack for someone and don't feel appreciated, that causes resentment. You don't feel respected. And when you point out the issue and that someone puts the blame on you, you have a problem. Because they do not see theirself as the problem.", "\"They have no kids of their own.\" Thank God,  he seems like a shitty father.", "I'm a little surprised that this isn't an age gap sorry, 'cause it looks like he just wanted a nanny.", "Exactly.  SHe is 100% being used.", "Can't tell if OP is the bang-maid or the bang-nanny, but she is NTA,\n\nThe husband is completely an A. OP should seriously reconsider this relationship.\n\nHe's throwing her under the bus, blaming her for his failings. What does he bring to the relationship?", "His custody time was awarded so that he could maintain a positive relationship with his daughter. He's not doing that if he's not around.", "But the husband knew for two weeks, it\u2019s not last minute. OP should have direct communication with bio mom if husband plays stupid ( ie lies through his teeth)"]}
