We have a large senior dog (Lue, 15m) who is declining in health.  He gets a pain pill every other night with dinner, and didn't have one Weds night.  Bladder control isn't great anymore either.\n\nFriday morning, I was woken by Lue coming up to my side of the bed.  He never does this, so I knew he needed to go out.  I groggily jumped out of bed and was a little frantic because by the time he tells me he needs out, there's not much time before he loses control.  \n\nDan sleepily asked what was going on.  I told him I'm sorry but I need to turn on a light so I can see to get Lue out the door and see if there were any messes on the way.  I turned on the bathroom light, which illuminates mostly the hallway but also the bedroom a bit.  I looked at the clock on my way, and it was 3:55am.\n\nLue peed as soon as he got outside.  When he came back in, I noticed that he was swaying and trembling.  Lue and I both went back to bed.  I knew Dan was still awake, so I asked if Lue got his pills with dinner (Dan had fed Lue the night before).  He said no, he didn't give Lue the pills...  I said, \"Dan, he can't skip two days, he's in pain.\" and Dan's response was, \"Okay, can I go back to sleep now??\"  \n\nOf course, I got back up to give Lue his pills so he could be comfortable.  I went to the kitchen, prepared the pills in pill pockets, and made my way back to the bedroom to give them to Lue.  \n\nI turned the bathroom light back on to give Lue the pills, to make sure he didn't spit them out.  Dan aggravatedly asked \"what's going on?? can you turn the freaking light off??\"  At this point I was irritated myself; I told him I had to give Lue his pills because he failed to do so and our dog is in pain, so he could **just deal** for the extra minute this was taking.  Lue ate the pills and I turned the light off and went back to bed.  (From the moment I woke, all of this only took a few minutes total)\n\nDan proceeded to loudly sigh, toss and turn for the rest of the morning, so neither of us managed to get back to sleep.  It felt like a toddler tantrum.  The next day he complained that the light had been on *too long*.  I told him I'm sorry, I will try to be quicker if it happens again, but maybe he can try to be more understanding, too.\n\nLue needed out again this morning at 4:00.  This time he was trying to wake Dan over on his side of the bed.  Dan has a bunch of shit all over the floor on his side, so I HAD to turn the bathroom light on so I could help Lue out of the room (he was over there stumbling on all the cords and crap).  I apologized and turned on the bathroom light for *not even 10 seconds* to guide Lue out of the mess.  \n\nWent back to bed, repeat process, no more sleep.  Now Dan's complaint is that the light was on *at all*.  He said to use my phone flashlight next time.  I told him to get his ass up himself next time, instead of throwing tantrums and keeping us up.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1699985822, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17v8ghu/aita_for_turning_on_a_light_while_my_husband_was/", "score": 446, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

His nonchalant attitude about your dog being in pain is nasty. It's very odd that he is so cavalier about not having given Lue his medication- wouldn't one not want a beloved family pet to be suffering, or to have an accident in-doors? Surely he realizes that cleaning up an accident would require more lights-on time than just taking the dog outside when needed. \n\nWhen our family dog Charlie was nearing the end of his life, he lost control over his bladder and bowels. It led to some very frustrating moments and lots of carpet cleaner, but nobody ever got upset with the dog *or* with each other.

And instead of taking his turn to help Lou the next night, he not only let\u2019s you take care of it, but he also makes a problem about how you do it and keeps you out of your sleep for the rest of the night?!

Next time, turn all the lights on and the tv too.", "NTA.\n\nYour husband sure as fuck is.\n\nMaybe he should care for 2 seconds more about your dog than a light bugging him for a few seconds. Obviously, the dogs health is getting worse.  I'm sorry about that.", "NTA. He caused the problem and then threw a little fit about the solution.

We lost our 18.5 year old Patterdale in April. We took turns being up with him at the end because he wanted to be cuddled all night and had occasional seizures.

My husband and I also have an elderly dog (15, nearly blind, deaf, a touch of dementia maybe, definitely not great bladder control) and when that dog wakes up in the night, one of us gets up, helps her off the bed and takes her outside or to the bathroom for water depending on what she needs.

I wasn\u2019t mad at the dog and would have dealt with the situation as long as he had a good quality of life. It was almost a year of this.  He was my husband\u2019s dog and never mine (by the dog\u2019s choosing) but I cleaned up messes by flashlight and rushed the pup out whenever he needed it without ever contemplating turning all the lights on.

However, with that being said, if Lou Is on high doses of pain medication and has frequent accidents in the house at 15yrs old, it might be time to put his best interest ahead of your contort, no matter how hard it is for you. When we had to put our dog down we were definitely naive/blinded to the situation until it was necessary because it got too serious (he fell down the stairs a broke his front paw through the skin).

I would leave the light on for 10 minutes until they were both back in bed with me, or vice versa. My husband took him a majority of the time (it was my dog..) because he knows I hate mornings. \n\nSomeone being annoyed with an elderly dog in pain is\u2026 hard to even read about and a HUGE red flag. My husband will get up when I need to feed our baby just for moral support and company at 1AM even though he has to work in the morning. His theory is I have to work too\u2026 taking care of our child and physically producing food etc. \n\nYour husband needs to do better.", "NTA. OP, we recently went through the same thing with my 15 year old dog. She had incontinence for about a year. She wore diapers at night and sometimes leaked through so we\u2019d wake up in the middle of the night and have to change the sheets. Then our other dog and the cats would be weak and needy, it would easily become an hour long ordeal. \n\nIt is difficult taking care of an elderly dog, but holy shit, how lacking in empathy is this man that he not only forgot to give your baby medication, but is more concerned about his sleep than about Lue\u2019s basic needs like going potty? It\u2019s honestly disgusting for someone to make that commitment to care for another living being and then not follow through in their hardest times. \n\nWe had a rule: not only did we not yell or get upset when our baby had an accident or needed to go out for the millionth time, but we made it a point to NOT show our irritation. My boyfriend did once in the beginning and I told him \u201cshe knows you\u2019re upset and she knows it\u2019s her fault. Do NOT ever let her feel bad about her incontinence again. She has no control over it, and she deserves to live the rest of her life feeling safe and happy, not stressed.\u201d I would suggest having a similar hardline rule set with your husband. \n\nMake sure Lue knows how much you love him, every single day.
