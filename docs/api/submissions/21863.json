She was at fault (she sideswiped someone in her blindspot). It completely bent her frame and her car is beyond repair. The only dealership that will approve her for a vehicle won't have her vehicle available for 2 weeks (it's a buy here pay here). \n\nNow, my brother and his wife are buying a part of my land (2 acres). My brother makes monthly payments on it while his wife stays home all day. She claims its because the pregnancy is destroying her legs and it hurts to walk. Since she has been out of work, I knocked $300 off the monthly cost to help him out. His wife doesn't ever go anywhere so her vehicle just sits in the driveway. My daughter obviously needs a car so I talked to my brother 3 days ago and told him that for the next two weeks, they should consider allowing my daughter to use the vehicle because I don't have time to take her to work and Uber would be costing easily $200 a day due to the distance. My brother said \"that's probably not going to happen\" and I said \"well make it happen\". After all, I'm knocking money off their monthly rent and it's the least they can do.\n\nI call him this morning and ask him why he hasn't gotten back to me and he says \"my wife isn't comfortable with your daughter using her vehicle after just crashing her own\" and gave some excuse of \"the car is the only thing she really has so it's a big ask\". I guess because his wife has been selling off her stuff to make bills since she's out of work. I told him he needs to figure it out or the payments will go back up because I will need to help my daughter get a vehicle. He says I'm an AH because I'm \"taking my daughters negligence out on them\".", "created_utc": 1689013008, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14w1pef/aita_for_expecting_my_sil_to_let_my_daughter_use/", "score": 101, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Neither you nor your daughter asked him? Smells like entitlement to me.\n\n>After all, I'm knocking money off their monthly rent and it's the least they can do.\n\nYou're using a payment discount on the land your brother is buying from you as leverage to get your way? BTW, it's not \"rent\" if it's part of a purchasing plan.\n\nYTA. This is a problem for your daughter to solve (with your help if you so choose). You don't get to make demands of people, even family, about their privately owned property, even if they're in the process of making payments to you. Period.\n\nAnd I'll just add that leveraging the land discount over him is a particularly disgusting tactic.

It is quite reasonable for anyone to not be comfortable loaning her their car.  Especially if they are in a tight financial position.  Having a car could be the difference between your SIL being able to go back to work after the baby is born, versus being stuck at home.  \n\nDo you have the money to replace your SIL's car, if you force her to let your daughter drive it, and she crashes again?  How would you make that right, if you're the one who forces the issue?\n\nFor a compromise, why don't you give ***your*** daughter your car, and then you drive SIL's?  That way, you assume the risks of your daughter driving, which you don't seem to think are excessive, and your SIL's car is driven by you, a more experienced driver, addressing her concerns.", "YTA. Massively. Huge entitlement issues here. \n\n\u201cMake it happen\u201d ouch! \n\nIf you\u2019re knocking of $300 because your SIL is out of work but it hinges on the caveat that your (it seems) terrible driver daughter gets to use the car, then you\u2019re not really knocking $300 off to be kind or to help them.", "YTA and you're really rude too", "YTA - It doesn't matter if she's using the car or not, it's *HER* car.

Why did you just assume that she could use the car? Asking kindly and politely would have gone a long way. This post includes so much entitlement that I almost think it's just bait. I refuse to believe that an adult such as yourself would be so cluelessly entitled. YOU chose to knock off their rent. You know they are in a bad position financially. You know she is pregnant and stuck at home, so she may need a car. You know that YOUR daughter crashed HER car. They don't owe you shit. YTA big big big time.", "YTA. For so many reasons. \n\nThe way you talk about your SILs struggles with her pregnancy being the first one. Then feeling entitled to something that isn't yours and holding over there heads something you offered to try and control their decision being the bigger one. Your daughter messed up, it sucks but cars are expensive and rarely does insurance cover enough to actually replace them if you/someone wrecks it which makes what you're asking a good 20,000 dollar ask.", "YTA. You clearly don't respect your brother and SIL, and think that because you lowered their mortgage they should be subservient to you. Your attitude is horrible.

Its 100% reasonable that your SIL doesn't want to risk lending your daughter her car. It's an absolutely HUGE favour and the fact that you demanded it rather than asking was very rude.\n\nYou giving them a discount on their rent/payments is a totally separate issue and it's pretty vindictive to use it to get them back for not complying with your demands.", "1.

I wouldn\u2019t loan her mine either. Did she not have rental coverage on her insurance? Why not? Is it liability only?", "YTA.\n\nYour daughter just totaled her car due to her own negligence. Obviously, the answer is to get someone you're helping, and brow-beat them to make them let her trash their car, too.\n\nYes, you're helping them out. But that doesn't mean that they have to do let your daughter mess up their own car. And telling them that you'll stop helping them if they don't help you is an AH move.", "YTA, lol. Buy the car off your SIL then.", "YTA, no way would I let someone use my car after they were at fault for a side swipe accident.

YTA. That's why. Which part isn't clear?", "YTA, obviously. They don't owe you their car. They aren't obligated to let your daughter drive it. Frankly, I wouldn't want her driving my car either.\n\nINFO: Why isn't your daughter's insurance covering a rental while hers is being repaired?", "YTA. I agree with the other comments that it is reasonable for your SIL to not want a 22-year-old who just totaled her own car to drive her car. Moreover, between the two acres of land and the high estimated cost of Ubering, it sounds like you live in a somewhat rural location. If I were a pregnant woman alone all day in a relatively rural area, I would be scared to be there without transportation.", "Yep YTA actions come with consequences", "Absolutely YTA, what everyone else has said. Plus just, wow! What did you actually think people were going to say????", "YTA and a large one at that\n\nI wouldnt want to let someone borrow my car, period. Let alone someone who had just totaled theirs! Insurance should pay for a loaner for at least a couple weeks to allow for getting a new car. Even if not, use that $300 and pay for a rental to cover the gap in her having a car, not to muddy your family relationship.", "YTA. A huge asshole.", "YTA.  If roles were reversed, you'd be ok handing over your car?", "YTA, and I'm really struggling to see how any reasonable person could even ask if they were in the wrong in your situation.  You agreeing to lower the payments for your brother is not the same as them lending a car to your daughter who has already shown she's irresponsible with cars. Anyone who puts strings on a gift, like threatening to take it away if the giftee doesn't do what you want, is almost always the AH.", "YTA. Your daughter was reckless and now you expect someone else to just allow her to use their vehicle?  Absolutely not.", ">). My brother makes monthly payments on it while his wife stays home all day. She claims its because the pregnancy is destroying her legs and it hurts to walk\n\nI am a 23 year old guy(no kids). But even I understand that this is not an excuse but a legit problem. And she is not sitting at home, she is unable to work. There's difference. \n\n>\". After all, I'm knocking money off their monthly rent and it's the least they can do.\n\nI thought maybe you were being generous and a great support but apparently not.\n\nI am sure your daughter didn't face any consequences for her actions and I am surprised by the way you talk that you accepted it was her fault.\n\nYou really think any sane person is going to let her drive their car. What if she kills anyone next, are you going to take the responsibility.", "YTA.  It\u2019s not your car nor is it your daughter\u2019s. Also, your daughter is an adult and she should be responsible for finding her own transportation.", "YTA.  Your agreement with your brother and your expectation that he let your daughter (who was just in an at-fault accident) use his car, leaving a pregnant woman home alone with no car, are two separate issues.  \n\n\nDoesn't your daughter have rental car coverage with her auto insurance?", "YTA let\u2019s ignore the many assholish things you peppered in here for\u2026.

The natural, logical consequences of causing an accident and damaging her car, is not having a car.\n\nFor you to do anything else is enabling her. To demand anything from anyone else is entitlement. She should be old enough to understand this.\n\nYTA for enabling and entitlement. As the saying goes, this a you problem.", "YTA\n\nYour daughter was at fault and wrote off her car.  To cause that much damage the chances are she also wrote off the car she hit.  So that is TWO vehicles written off due to her negligence.  I hope the driver of the other car was not injured and will recover mentally from this.", "YTA You're careless daughter caused an accident and totaled her car. Apparently, she skimped on insurance too because she can't get rental.

Yep, you are AH because you are taking your daughter's negligence out on them. You agreed on a certain monthly payment and now you are going back on your word because it got inconvenient for you. Your daughter can rent a car for less than $200/day.", "YTA. Your daughter made an irresponsible choice and you do not get to make your SIL do anything because of it.

I bet if you had asked instead of demanded and tried to coerce, they might have considered. Two, they owe you nothing. You claim to knock off $300 to help them out now you want to lord that over their heads as a way to threaten them and twist their arm into doing what you want...either do it for good or don't do it at all. \n\nTelling someone to make something happen, with their property that they bought with their money to help you not be inconvenienced by your daughter who is your responsibility, is the quickest way to get people to say no.

She was at fault (she sideswiped someone in her blindspot). It completely bent her frame and her car is beyond repair. The only dealership that will approve her for a vehicle won't have her vehicle available for 2 weeks (it's a buy here pay here). \n\nNow, my brother and his wife are buying a part of my land (2 acres). My brother makes monthly payments on it while his wife stays home all day. She claims its because the pregnancy is destroying her legs and it hurts to walk. Since she has been out of work, I knocked $300 off the monthly cost to help him out. His wife doesn't ever go anywhere so her vehicle just sits in the driveway. My daughter obviously needs a car so I talked to my brother 3 days ago and told him that for the next two weeks, they should consider allowing my daughter to use the vehicle because I don't have time to take her to work and Uber would be costing easily $200 a day due to the distance. My brother said \"that's probably not going to happen\" and I said \"well make it happen\". After all, I'm knocking money off their monthly rent and it's the least they can do.\n\nI call him this morning and ask him why he hasn't gotten back to me and he says \"my wife isn't comfortable with your daughter using her vehicle after just crashing her own\" and gave some excuse of \"the car is the only thing she really has so it's a big ask\". I guess because his wife has been selling off her stuff to make bills since she's out of work. I told him he needs to figure it out or the payments will go back up because I will need to help my daughter get a vehicle. He says I'm an AH because I'm \"taking my daughters negligence out on them\".\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You have no idea what happens behind closed doors and with women when they're pregnant. Don't judge whether the SIL is working. Also, pregnant women need to have access to a car and you think she doesn't need one. One more: your daughter is now an adult and also responsible for the destruction of her own vehicle.
