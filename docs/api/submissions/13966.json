Ejected more than once, banned from the league.\n\nThey should change the rules in this league.", "NTA, but close to YTA for not finishing the game with your team, kinda shitty to leave them hanging, but I also get why.

I'm not trying to hold off on pitches slightly out of the zone so I can improve my OBP in a game where half the people are buzzed anyway.", "Since you acknowledge you should have finished the game, whether you were the A is a moot point.  \n\nOf course your subordinates cheered you, they are still impressionable. And of course your peers gave you crap, you were setting a bad example and they knew it.

You're a leader, you may not think it, but they will model your bad behavior too.", "ESH\n\nThe other team are not playing in the spirit of the game - it is intended as a fun league for amateurs to enjoy playing the game, and that sort of tactical play just ruins it for everyone.\n\nAt the same time, walking off was an asshole move towards your team. You should at least have finished the game and resigned respectfully rather than walking off in a huff.\n\nAt the same time, I do also wander if you might be guilty of taking the game a bit seriously too - the way you describe your batting makes me wander if their level of competitiveness may have been influenced by your own attitude. I may be completely wrong here, but it is something that may be worth considering.", "NTA, but I don\u2019t think you should\u2019ve left your team.
