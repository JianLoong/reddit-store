I also will find a more competitive league when I have more free time.

Every Rec league has a few AH that think that they were one scout away from the majors. And on your edit you seem to realize you boned your team so yeah you go bro. Go smash some competitive leagues.

The only people you stuck it to walking out were your buddies. Not the other team.", "What does it mean to be rolled the ball? As in its reaching you on the ground?", "ESH. Way to bail on your team. Maybe just go to batting cages if you only want to hit.", "ESH.  A rec league should be fun and it sounds like it\u2019s being taken way too seriously. Intentionally walking you takes the fun out of the game and you were totally justified in being angry. \n\nThat said, you need to learn how to respond to frustrating situations more appropriately.  Your actions obviously weren\u2019t the best way to handle the situation and I\u2019m pretty sure you know that.  Next time, take a deep breath, keep playing the lame game, and then quit at the end of the game like an adult.", "I'm genuinely shocked that all the YTA votes are being downvoted. Yeah, it sucks that he keeps being walked, but he had a hissy fit mid-bat and left. Just quit after the game and find a better league to join", "YTA. Leaving didn\u2019t hurt the team that was intentionally walking you, it hurt your own teammates. You \u201cpunished\u201d the wrong people. If the league doesn\u2019t work for you, that\u2019s fine, feel free to quit and move on, but not in the middle of a game.", "NTA baseball is garbage anyway, you spend 95% of the game just waiting to do anything", "I hear you, that's got to be frustrating to not be able to bat.\n\nBut why does this mean you can't play anymore? Can't you play on the field and contribute to your team that way? Or are you the DH?", "YTA for leaving, tbh I'm competitive as fuck and none of these nerds would ever hear the end of it if I got walked all day long, instead now you're a sore sport and a whiner and nobody likes that\n\nQuitting sounds like the right move though you should go find a serious league if you're out there batting 1.0 and smackin' em out the park.", "YTA - Yeah it sucks being walked over and over again...but you are part of the team and softball isn't just about your time at bat. And sets a bad example to other Soldiers. Would you do this in other parts of your life?", "Quit after the game. You only punished your own \"team-mates\" here.\n\nYTA", "I played on a post team and a co-ed team (catcher)   I am a woman (was a spouse).\n\nYou are an asshole.\n\nNever choose your ego or temper over your teammates.", "YTA.\n\nNot for quitting if it's no fun for you. I don't know softball to know how dirty that was of them, but I'll assume it's really bad since it makes no difference to what im about to say: you should've seen out that game.\n\nYour team didn't do anything wrong to you. They were playing the game and they were your guys. You stick by them through the match and settle your differences behind the scenes. Show them the loyalty and respect they deserve on the pitch. If you part ways after then so be it, but don't do that to them in front of others.", "YTA for how you handled the situation. Your feelings are valid and it would\u2019ve been fair to leave the league, but quitting in the middle of the game is bad sportsmanship especially for your own team.", "YTA, you let your team down. \n\nPart of sports (no matter how doubtful the level) is you play to win. If the other team think they have a better chance when letting you walk, it's their choice. On the other side, it's your choice of you want to compete or not. What you did now, is just walk out on a team that was expecting you to play. You ran off like a little kid, and that's not how sportmanship works.", "YTA\n\nIf you're not having fun and don't want to keep playing after this game, by all means, quit. But walking out midgame like a giant baby because you don't like how the other team is playing is a shit thing to do. Fact is, intentional walks are a legal part of the game, whether you like them or not. Boo hoo, you didn't get a chance to knock one out of the park. Show off your base running instead.", "Yta. You're team aren't screwign you over, but you screwed over your team, and that makes you an ah. Sure, quit after the match by all means, but you're not always going to win, or have great chances to show off, and whilst the other team were being poor sports, that's somethign that should be raised outside of the immediate match.\n\nIf you arent willing to act as part of a team (which your actions show), just find somewhere you can just practice batting.", "YTA.  You walked out on your team.  Instead of handling it in a mature way, you had a hissy fit.  It definetly can cause doubts about your reliability when it actually matters.", "Your logic is sound. Okay, your team suffered for it, but NTA. This is a team sport and there is no L in team. L for left out, that is. But still, I totally get why you'd leave.", "Yta\n\n\"Me, me, me, why should I do xyz?\"\n\nThere's no \"I\" in team, buddy, and throwing a fit and then leaving your teammates short a man is terrible sportsmanship. If you sink down to the other team's level, you're as bad as they are.", "YTA.\n\nYou signed up for the team, they're depending on you, you have an obligation to at least finish the game.\n\nIntentional walks are a part of the game, as you should know. Figure out a different way to contribute to the team's success. The way it is, you just come across as a sore loser.", "NTA, time is precious, if they're not going to let you enjoy playing why bother being there", " If the league doesn\u2019t work for you, that\u2019s fine, feel free to quit and move on", "I'd disagree. Nobody was letting him hit anyway,  so how did he fail his team? He wasn't the pitcher either, and I'm sure they rotate positions sometimes so all can play. \n\nCould he have handled it better? Yes, but he didn't let his team down. They let him down by not actively advocating for the other teams to play fair.", "Only because they put you in deep, deep, deep right field.", "He can play in the field but that\u2019s only half the game. He should be able to bat too.", "Batting is half the game. What's the point in showing up when they're literally not letting him take part in that? He isn't Mike Trout. Getting intentionally walked in a rec league is ludicrous.", "What was the point of them being there if they weren\u2019t allowed to play? May as well left a stuffed animal in their place that the other team could walk to each base on their own.", ">Would you do this in other parts of your life?\n\nYes absolutely. \n\nIf I'm in an activity that's meant to be **fun** for everyone. And people are purposely creating a situation that makes this no longer any fun for me. I would walk every time.", "Basically the other team intentionally was throwing the ball away every time he was batting so OP never got to bat", "I\u2019m already the sacrificial lamb of my office for 50-70 hours of the week (I work 5-10 hours on the weekend too). I also assist in tutoring, voting, and equal opportunity in my unit. Those take a couple hours too. \n\nThis was my lone outlet. Then the other teams heard about me and put an end to that.\n\nHow should I have handled this situation and clearly not being allowed to bat again going forward?\n\n(Genuine question, I won\u2019t respond to your response. I\u2019ll only read it and listen.)", "\u201cThere\u2019s no I in team, but there\u2019s a me in that motherf***er.\u201d\n\n-Kobe Bean Bryant", "I'm with you. Where was anyone else on OPs team? I'd be mad!", "Last time I checked softball was played both offensively and defensively. He wasn\u2019t not being allowed to play\u2026 he was being given a free base every at bat\u2026 so steal second (if that\u2019s how the other team is playing why wouldn\u2019t you?) and get yourself in scoring position if you\u2019re such a hot shot. \nHe\u2019s the guy that takes batting practice but then doesn\u2019t shag balls for anyone else. Nobody likes to play with that guy.", "That's why he should quit the team after; he's clearly too good, he needs to find a higher league. Taking your glove and going home is certainly a choice but it ain't a good one. \n\nShould've upped his shit-talking to 1000, other team's a buncha pricks and they're too chickenshit to pitch to the ringer, well running away let's them get away with it, good going. Win or lose you don't just leave like that.", "I got that much. I just don't know how frowned upon that is because softball isn't a thing here. \n\nIt doesn't matter to my point though. I'm just saying you stick with your team until the end of the game. Say your piece or whatever, but his teammates didn't do anything to him and he snubbed them by walking out mid-game.", "My advice would've been to accept the L, and have fun with a game whose conclusion is foregone. Then excuse yourself after the game, claiming to be busy. Leaving like that leaves no plausible deniablility to your reasons for true leaving.\n\nAt least when I was in sports, admittedly stopping early, we were taught to keep playing until the end", "Opposite actually \u2014\n\nI field all the outfield balls when we have a practice so my teammates can get reps in. \n\nNo point in wasting their time.", "Not only was the other team already acting in bad taste for being so competitive about a rec softball game, but it sounds like they were also mocking him when they literally rolled the ball at him. There was no chance of OP having fun at that point, and I would have walked off as well. NTA", "Then why\u2019d you bail on your team dude? I agree that getting repeatedly intentionally walked sucks. But if you\u2019re such a team player, how do you walk out on your team mid game. Suck it up. Quit throwing temper tantrums. U8\u2019s can control their emotions better than this."]}
