I never left the state of NY until senior year of Highschool. It didn\u2019t help that I got a sports scholarship to a manhattan private school and I always heard of their luxurious vacations and felt a little jealous.\n\nBut every spring break my dad took me and my two sisters to this camp site in upstate New York. We slept in tents,went fishing, made s\u2019mores and had a great time. \n\nMy wife is from a very wealthy New Jersey suburb and grew up spending vacations abroad or in Florida. Our different upbringings don\u2019t affect us that much usually. We both have very well off jobs and can give our girls a very great life.\n\nUsually we take our kids on luxurious cruises and vacations. But this year I suggested to my wife that on spring break we go camping so I could give the kids a little taste of my childhood and she said yes very excitedly. But as much as I\u2019ve tried to explain to her what I want it to be like she doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nFirst she was looking through these insanely luxurious RV\u2019s with separate rooms and TV\u2019s. I explained that was way more than we needed and we could just sleep in tents. She was appalled at the idea. So then she found this very upscale family camp where we could stay in cabins that were basically mini-mansions and eat in a cafeteria that looked like a 5star restaurant.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to explain as nice as I can that I don\u2019t want this to be a luxurious vacation. I found a nice camp site we can go to but all the lots are outdoor and she was not okay with that. I tried to compromise found a family camp with cabins that were more laid back and she was also grossed out by that.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s not willing to compromise at all and it\u2019s making me sad because she gets to share her childhood and have nostalgia through her experiences with our kids all the time but the second I do it\u2019s a problem. I feel like she\u2019s incapable of relinquishing control and usually I\u2019m ok with that but I wanted this to be my thing.

I imagine your wife was the one meticulously planning your prior luxurious trips, as that\u2019s her fort\u00e9. I\u2019d tell her that you expect her to take a back seat for the planning this time and let you do your thing, just as you have allowed her to do prior times. If she continues to argue about her own comfort level regarding the camping plans you want to make, I think you should go ahead and tell her straight that she isn\u2019t required to come, and that this is something you want to do specifically for yourself so you can bond with your kids YOUR way. Assure her that it\u2019s not like her presence would be a nuisance and that she is more than welcome to join, but that she cannot dictate this specific trip.

You should be able to take your kids on a camping trip the way you are envisioning. \n\n\nHowever, to me, and to many other people, including your wife, that sounds less like a vacation and more like a very, very bad time.

But I will add that you should at least make sure whatever campground you choose has a bathhouse, especially if you ever want her to go camping again.", "NTA and it sounds like part of the problem is you usually let her control things and you don\u2019t mutually make decisions.", "NAH - yet, I think its perfectly fine to not want to go camping. Its just not some people\u2019s thing. This seems more of a miscommunication issue though.", "NAH. You\u2019re conflating two things that don\u2019t necessarily have that much to do with each other. One is sharing your experiences with your kids. You should definitely do that, & I bet even your wife agrees with that. The second is camping. A lot of people don\u2019t like camping. It\u2019s got nothing to do with control or nostalgia or any of that. Many people don\u2019t like sleeping in a tent or cooking outdoors. Suggest that you start small. Let your wife stay home & take the kids by yourself for a couple of nights of camping at a nearby tent campground. See what your kids think of it & how much you like it as an adult. If you have fun, maybe next time your wife will join you.", "NAH. Also just saying do your kids want to go camping in tents? If your kids are used to more luxurious trips they may not want to sleep in tents and just complain the whole time. An RV would be the closest thing to it that they might want to do and you could still do s\u2019mores and the daytime activities.", " I think it'll be a good experience for your kids. It sounds like your wife doesn't care what you want. If it's not fancy, she won't say yes. I would suggest a father daughter trip just the 3 of you, but I can tell your wife won't like it.

If it\u2019s not her thing she can opt out", "NTA  Just leave her home.", "NAH. Take the kids solo. Let your wife stay home where she's comfortable.

Is this about sharing your experience with your family? \n\nOP, before you get up in arms about what I am about to say let me preface it with this statement. I have camped in a tent, a pop-up camper, a camper trailer, and cabins. I can clean a latrine, collect firewood, build a fire pit and fire, haul water, use a bathhouse and and outhouse. I can cook on that fire, on a propane stove, and even make an oven out of a box and aluminum foil. \n\nYou might want to ask yourself what you want to convey, share and experience with your family, and why. What is your goal? \n\nWhile you may hanker for the simplicity of a tent, does sleeping a little more comfortably in a pop-up too much of a stretch? If your wife is left out, and it sounds like it is contentious already, how will it affect your children, and yes, even your marriage? \n\nCould you compromise on the sleeping arrangements a little, while encouraging simplicity? You could cook over the fire, tell stories around it and roast the marshmallows and make s\u2019mores. Hiking, fishing, skipping stones, jumping boulders can happen no matter where you lay your head. \n\nExpressing your feelings and thoughts, expectations, and doubts about changing anything might go a long way towards achieving the goal you want to accomplish. \n\nBEST OF IT ALL, OP.   Oh, btw, Please make them have some fried SPAM, on a bun with an egg on top. Add cheese of choice if that is your way. AND- Thin Mint S\u2019mores are dang tasty. Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies with the toasted, roasted, golden brown marshmallow sandwiched between. Scrumptious! \n\nIsn\u2019t it really that we remember the marshmallow torches blazing even as they dropped into the flames. That sister found the Mack Daddy fossil and you found a pine cone.

Being outdoors is just not something I enjoy.  I have a tshirt that says \"Nature makes me itchy\" and it perfectly encapsulates my feelings about everything outside my house.  \n\nMy husband LOVES camping.  He used to go with his dad and he loves taking our kids.  I go, too, because it's important for him and because I can suck it up for few days.  We've learnt to compromise.  I can't deal with the remote camping deal.  My absolute minimum is flushing toilets and hot showers.  So we will often go to campsites that have those facilities or stay in parks.  When he wants to do that sort of camping, I help pack everything up, get the kids organised, make sure they've got sunscreen and wave them goodbye.  If they're going to be away for more than a few days, I'll drive out to spend a day or two with them.  Or just leave them to it.  \n\nThe important thing, though, is I gave it a few tries before I decided that it really wasn't for me.", ">But every spring break **my dad** took me\n\nWas your mom on these trips? Take your kids by yourself if you want them to experience what you had as a kid. However, bare in mind, the trip was a big deal to you because you didn't have other vacations as a kid for comparison in your own life. Your kids have had a different life and might not feel the same way. Trying to replicate nostalgia tends to ruin it and you might not enjoy it now. Your wife is probably not going to do what you want. NAH.\n\nLet me rewrite this. Why isn't my wife letting me drag her along to an experience she doesn't want and will probably hate? Gosh, sir, I have no idea. A compromise is get an RV and then you and the kids go sleep in tents. That way they can go back to the RV if they don't love it. I'm unsure about the summer camp comparison.", "Teardrop trailer manufacturer here: We do not try to sell someone on our trailers if that is not what they want when they go camping. If they want the big RV, THEY WANT THE BIG RV! With the fireplace and separate beds and White Russians on the dining room table. Don't try to sell someone on what they DON'T want. They will not enjoy it. Let Mom have a spa weekend, take kids tent camping. Bond. Just sayin'.", "NTA, but make sure she knows it\u2019s fine if this isn\u2019t her thing and she wants to stay home. Also, I\u2019m not convinced you know what you are getting into here. Camping as an adult with children, especially a solo adult or an adult with an inexperienced co-leader, is a lot of work and requires a lot of planning. I\u2019m a SAHM and basically treat prepping for our camping trips as my full time job for 2 weeks ahead of a trip. I highly recommend starting with a backyard camp out for a night or two, then a long weekend at a local park, then maybe a 4 day trip over a school break with time after to relax and reset, clean all your equipment up and store it properly, etc. especially if you aren\u2019t the one who does the day to say mental load and behind the scenes work for your house and you haven\u2019t been camping since childhood, you have a lot on your plate for this trip.", "My best memories with my dad wher him taking me fishing just us. I think it's beneficial for kids to have alone trips and experiences with each parent because they get to understand you as a singular person and learn about you and how you do things. My dad taught me so much on those fishing trips and i learned alot about how he thinks and began to understand him and how he thinks.

Your wife should be able to do a better job of understanding and supporting what you are trying to do, you are totally right about that. \n\nHowever, you need a little more awareness that you are planning a Spring Break family VACATION.

This might be your idea of fun, but I get the impression it is \u201ccharacter building\u201d for the rest of the family.\n\nSo I would suggest you ease up and find the right occasion and duration for doing this - perhaps not spoiling everyone\u2019s Spring Break, but a 3 day weekend or something.", "NAH, but you're *really* close by stating you will *tell* her that it must be done your way.\n\nListen, I was a Scout as a kid. I've been camping in a tent, on a 2cm-thick foam mat and a sleeping bag. I've been camping in the rain and assembled a tent while it's been pouring down. I did a fourteen-day trip with a bunch of other Scouts just like that. I went with my family on a camp to the beach.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nI'd never do it now as a grown up. I've got the money for a proper bed, and a nice room, with room service. The very idea of lying on a foam mat in a tent, watching out for the bugs and the snakes, is repulsive.\n\nOP, I'm sensing some real resentment here that your wife had such a wealthier upbringing than you, and that she is giving your children a better experience than you had as a child.

She is being controlling and frankly classist.  You need to sit her down and explain you want to do it your way, and she can come or not, but you and kids are going to go tent. You can plan camping her way at another date if she wants to fancy-camp.

She thinks this an instagram weekend\n\nWhen you pitch this idea the best way to explain it is you find an amazing place in the woods, just land, water and hikes.  But you can only bring what you can carry on a back pack.  (You will need to buy new stuff).  The first time you do this you find a drive up place (still middle of nowhere) and bring extras so it looks like you are the one comprising but they still get the experience. You call it back yard camping and have some coolers in the car with food and drink and extra blankets and air mattresses and maybe yard games or movie projector.  \n\nWhen it\u2019s over you give them a mini grade (encouraging though) and ask them if they want to do real camping next time? If they say yes at least now they have an expectation.", "YTA if you TELL her she has to camp your way or else. Your her husband not her parent. There is a compromise somewhere between tent camping and glamour camping.", "I think u need to accept she does not want to do the same camping experience but still wants to be there.

That way she can come and still be comfortable", "Your wording is why YWBTA but I think you are correct; wifey would rather stay home than go without a min level of comfort.  If your looking for advise then look towards an rv or trailer with hot water, furnace, fridge, shower, and a queen sized bed.  You can bring and use tents.", "I think you should take a normal vacation and then next year, at some point that you to agree on, you can take the kids on your own trip like you had as a child.  \n\nIt\u2019s possible that your wife didn\u2019t quite understand what she was agreeing to.

It doesn\u2019t have to be her thing but she could at least try with a good adventurer attitude one week. Get your kids involved in scouting as soon as you are able- you can be very involved and share this bond together. They\u2019ll face a ball and learn a zillion life skills.

Also, encourage her to do something she really enjoys while you and the kids are gone. This could be visiting a spa, touring museums, whatever she likes.\n\nYou didn't say how old your children are. Make sure whatever activities you have in mind are appropriate for their ages, abilities and interests. If you do get to make this trip, listen to your kids. If they enjoy everything, great.

My cousin and her parents only ever went in an RV. Cooked in the RV, showered in the RV, brought more clothes with because there was more room to bring them, brought the tv and radio with, etc. I never wanted to go camping with them, because it wasn't the same, not because I was jealous of them being able to afford an RV. Fifty years later, I still go camping.  Now it is a 5th wheel because I can't sleep on the ground, use showers because my mobility scooter doesn't do well in sand, but I still do 90% of my cooking outdoors because that is what I prefer when camping!!", "Are you being ironic?

I wouldn\u2019t say tell her \u201cdo it this way or else\u201d, but perfectly legit to say to your wife \u201chey, this is what I actually want to do with the kids - if that\u2019s not your thing you\u2019re fine to stay home, but otherwise hop on board with me and help us all enjoy it\u201d.  Also, for all the people saying it\u2019s a huge amount of work, how the hell do you do camping?

For example, you go camping with the kids for two days while she waits for you at a nice hotel/spa near by. \n\nI would not settle for camping in your back yard like some posters are suggesting, tough. 1) while maybe fun, it won't prepare the kids for actual camping and 2) as a fellow urban kid, part of the magic in camping was the adventure of discovering and being inmersed in nature. \n\nAnyway, best of luck, hope you can organice something everyone is happy with, just be open to the possibility of the kids not loving it as much as you do.", "Rent the RV and take a tent with you.

Stop trying to talk her into it.\n\nJust take the girls on your own this time. Maybe you can meet up with your wife to do something different the second week.", "See if she wants to organize a trip with friends or go to a spa for week or something.  I hate camping, but boy would I love a week to myself.  \n\nI probably grew up a lot like the wife - my girl scout troup camped out at the holladome and during family vacations roughing it was a hotel without room service.  These days I am super happy staying at a cabin on an all sports lake - but no fing way am I sleeping in a tent for a week.  Personally I feel like if you didn't grow up doing it as a kid or in your teens then you aren't ever gonna have the same warm and fuzziness for the experience as the people with childhood memories.  Which, good for you get your kid those memories, but let your wife know that if that isn't her jam she can plan her own week for herself.", "Frankly, having been adjacent to RVs, no one should buy any RV whatsoever. They\u2019re shoddily constructed, expensive to fix, and often aren\u2019t covered by lemon laws.", "Lmao. Nah. Wife is major AH. Reading the post just makes me sad for OP as someone that enjoys hiking and nature", "It also doesn't look like he's spoken to his kids about this at all...\n\nObviously they don't get to just decide things on their own yet, but if they're also super grossed out/freaked out by the idea of actual camping than the trip will be completely miserable. \n\nIn general it seems like there just needs to be a lot more communication about what the goals are.", "Girls are children. Women are adults. And you can talk to women as if they\u2019re adults! Shocking, I know. If a woman doesn\u2019t want to do the thing you described, and you should describe it in detail- you know, like *informed consent* then you should take the no as your answer. You condescension and misogyny in this post is breathtaking. I would examine my views on women if I were you.", "I truly hate everything about camping but my daughter likes it so I let her go with my mom. I\u2019ll go every now and then if she wants me to though", "I don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong in that you feel like your wife isn\u2019t listening to you, and that\u2019s totally valid, however, I have to ask, how far away is this campground from your home? Have your kids done any camping before? Because as a kid that was forced into a week long camping vacation that sits solidly up there as one of the worst experiences of my childhood- and I grew up in a toxic home, so read into that what you will- I hated it. You\u2019ve got this image in your head that it\u2019ll Be Like When I Was A Kid (tm) and that can go so, so wrong when aimed at your kids. I would highly suggest camping in your backyard with your kids if you have one first, and keeping this trip short to start. This isn\u2019t the only trip you can take, and if your kids like it, they can go for longer later on. But camping is like coffee, for people who like it, they *really* like it. For people who don\u2019t, it\u2019s a horrendous experience.", "I've seen several people suggest giving the kids a trial night where you camp out in the back garden (if you have one), so they can get a taste for it in a low-stakes way, and also so if it the weather is terrible there's an easy escape for them. That seems like a great idea to me. Your wife may also be more willing to have a go if she has close access to a shower and a toilet!", "NTA unless you really push it. As others have suggested maybe take the kids away for a night or two camping on your own. You can get yurts that are practically like a luxury hotel (albeit you might have to put some logs in the stove occasionally), if you want to experience something like camping with your wife. The RV sounds amazing and is a great way to see a lot of places, maybe pack some tents in there so you can all have a good experience together?", "Fair read, I was trying to read this optimistically as just her being completely ignorant of how \u201cthe plebes\u201d live but willing to learn. Maybe not", "WTF? Lol. \n\nGoing through and existential crisis where everything is sexist are we?\n\nGirlfriend pretty common term for a women\n\nYes lots of \u201cgirls\u201d or women are seeing a glamping trend in travel socials.

So if I as a dad was like sorry kids I\u2019m not an amusement park fan so we can\u2019t go to Disney even though everybody else wants to go I wouldn\u2019t be an asshole? Of course I would be because it\u2019s an event for my kids and I need to suck it up or just not go if I\u2019m going to be a curmudgeon. The mom can bite the bullet because this is important to the dad and from what OP said the kids have liked going to camp in the past so they would like it. Dad already tried to compromise by changing to a cabin but then wife doesn\u2019t think the cabin is fancy enough. Parenting is passing down traditions and if the kids dont enjoy that tradition you can not do it anymore and discover new ones the kids will enjoy but the dad shouldn\u2019t be barred from even trying.", "Would you talk about a male friend the way you talked about a hypothetical woman here? I doubt you would. And it\u2019s not exactly new that calling adult women \u201cgirls\u201d is insulting. If you don\u2019t know that, I challenge you to recall when you call other men boys. As far as \u201cwho hurt me\u201d as opposed to being allowed to find your attitude incredibly insulting, it would be men like you, who think they can wiggle and squeeze their way into making women do what they want and using emotional manipulation to do it, as you just did in this post. Implying it\u2019s my emotions rather than your behavior that is at fault.\n\nEdit to add: It appears the commenter above me has sent me a \u201creddit cares\u201d message, which is a common tactic used to shut people down, and is pretty toxic.", "We rent a cabin at a nearby state park. It has the best of both worlds. It\u2019s air conditioned with plumbing and a small kitchen. Outside there\u2019s a fire pit and picnic table. And we can explore the park all day.

And come on, she\u2019s at least watched a movie where people (non glampy) camp, how out of touch are her demands", "I think this is just being pointed out to support the idea of it being such a random trip to go all in for like OP wants. They don't have any of the things needed at home already. To do a more \"rough it\" trip, a whole list of expenses just got added on. Just more insight to how much preparation and time beforehand would be needed, especially with kids.\nBuying all this stuff could be a giant waste of money if the kids don't enjoy the trip and they never go again.", "My kids liked camping. Most little kids I knew did. They liked being outdoors & they liked the novelty of sleeping in a tent. We usually camped in a park with a lake & that was fun. But it still took time to plan what to bring especially the food, & over time we accumulated equipment that made it easier.", "According to OPs post, his wife won't agree to a cabin but no idea hoe the one he suggested compares to Bear Mountain State Park.", "Um, not all kids are like this. My kids love camping", "I think it's telling that OP hasn't answered the question, although  OP has posted replies to some other comments. It's a question about how prepared and how practical he is being in regard to actually running a multi day camping trip with his kids. He sounds like he wants to get some tents &  some sleeping bags and consider themselves equipped because that's what he remembers from his childhood camping trips.  As you point out, camping can require a lot of equipment to make it more enjoyable. From that point of view, his wife is actually being more practical by saying let's rent a nice cabin or an RV so we can be comfortable and see if we like being outdoors and the camping-ish experiences before we invest a lot of money in equipment we're going to use once.", "No, you wouldn\u2019t be an asshole for refusing to go to disney- there are many, many parents who do for this very reason.

That's not campings fault", "Plus you're responsible for planning all the meals, shopping, packing, cooking, and doing clean up.  It's housework in a different location, not a vacation.", "Camping is not the problem there! Sounds like the men wanted a camping trip with the older kids, but still wanted dinner on the table when they got back! You don't get to go camping and take a maid. I don't blame you for not going, but hubby's the issue, not the camping.", ">The only difference I can think of is that we have to be pickier about where we pee in the woods.\n\nGetting your period while camping SUCKS.\n\nWhen it happens, you're praying you at least have access to a modern bathroom and not an outhouse otherwise there is literally nowhere to change a pad/tampon with any degree of privacy. Also, showers! When I'm on my period, I want regular, long, hot showers just to feel clean. And frankly, when I'm in pain and bleeding, I want the comforts of home! I want a heating pad, a comfy couch to curl up on with a blanket, and an endless supply of hot tea - not a sleeping bag on lumpy ground and no amenities for comfort.\n\nI still camp. But now I try and schedule my trips for when I'm least likely to have my period, and I cancel outright if I'm wrong. I would rather reschedule than be miserable unnecessarily.", "Just gonna ignore your consent comment? Also it is very normal to call women in their 20s girls. And you ever here of boys night out?

There's a good chance he would become resentful if the kids bail on the tent when it gets too cold or scary.\n\nLet me tell you from experience, having a resentful parent on a camping trip will make the worst memories.", "You can rent camping gear at places like REI, they don't have to buy everything at once. There are options.", "Renting it is still an added expense though, so it\u2019s not like your point here is invalidating the argument of person you replied to.", "Yeah, still an added expense that could be pricy but possible. \nI also think it's to point out how this isn't a hobby, even for him. They probably should come to some sort of middle ground on the type of camping trip. A cute little trailer or something, but they're both too hard headed in the \"my way or no way\" for something that OP doesn't do regularly and the others have never done before."]}
