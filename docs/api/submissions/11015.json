Our different upbringings don\u2019t affect us that much usually. We both have very well off jobs and can give our girls a very great life.\n\nUsually we take our kids on luxurious cruises and vacations. But this year I suggested to my wife that on spring break we go camping so I could give the kids a little taste of my childhood and she said yes very excitedly. But as much as I\u2019ve tried to explain to her what I want it to be like she doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nFirst she was looking through these insanely luxurious RV\u2019s with separate rooms and TV\u2019s. I explained that was way more than we needed and we could just sleep in tents. She was appalled at the idea. So then she found this very upscale family camp where we could stay in cabins that were basically mini-mansions and eat in a cafeteria that looked like a 5star restaurant.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to explain as nice as I can that I don\u2019t want this to be a luxurious vacation. I found a nice camp site we can go to but all the lots are outdoor and she was not okay with that. I tried to compromise found a family camp with cabins that were more laid back and she was also grossed out by that.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s not willing to compromise at all and it\u2019s making me sad because she gets to share her childhood and have nostalgia through her experiences with our kids all the time but the second I do it\u2019s a problem. I feel like she\u2019s incapable of relinquishing control and usually I\u2019m ok with that but I wanted this to be my thing.

I imagine your wife was the one meticulously planning your prior luxurious trips, as that\u2019s her fort\u00e9.

If she continues to argue about her own comfort level regarding the camping plans you want to make, I think you should go ahead and tell her straight that she isn\u2019t required to come, and that this is something you want to do specifically for yourself so you can bond with your kids YOUR way. Assure her that it\u2019s not like her presence would be a nuisance and that she is more than welcome to join, but that she cannot dictate this specific trip.

You should be able to take your kids on a camping trip the way you are envisioning. \n\n\nHowever, to me, and to many other people, including your wife, that sounds less like a vacation and more like a very, very bad time.

Its just not some people\u2019s thing. This seems more of a miscommunication issue though.", "NAH. You\u2019re conflating two things that don\u2019t necessarily have that much to do with each other. One is sharing your experiences with your kids. You should definitely do that, & I bet even your wife agrees with that. The second is camping. A lot of people don\u2019t like camping. It\u2019s got nothing to do with control or nostalgia or any of that. Many people don\u2019t like sleeping in a tent or cooking outdoors. Suggest that you start small. Let your wife stay home & take the kids by yourself for a couple of nights of camping at a nearby tent campground. See what your kids think of it & how much you like it as an adult. If you have fun, maybe next time your wife will join you.", "NAH. Also just saying do your kids want to go camping in tents? If your kids are used to more luxurious trips they may not want to sleep in tents and just complain the whole time. An RV would be the closest thing to it that they might want to do and you could still do s\u2019mores and the daytime activities.", " I think it'll be a good experience for your kids.

If it\u2019s not her thing she can opt out", "NTA  Just leave her home.", "NAH. Take the kids solo. Let your wife stay home where she's comfortable.

Is this about sharing your experience with your family? \n\nOP, before you get up in arms about what I am about to say let me preface it with this statement. I have camped in a tent, a pop-up camper, a camper trailer, and cabins. I can clean a latrine, collect firewood, build a fire pit and fire, haul water, use a bathhouse and and outhouse. I can cook on that fire, on a propane stove, and even make an oven out of a box and aluminum foil. \n\nYou might want to ask yourself what you want to convey, share and experience with your family, and why. What is your goal? \n\nWhile you may hanker for the simplicity of a tent, does sleeping a little more comfortably in a pop-up too much of a stretch? If your wife is left out, and it sounds like it is contentious already, how will it affect your children, and yes, even your marriage? \n\nCould you compromise on the sleeping arrangements a little, while encouraging simplicity? You could cook over the fire, tell stories around it and roast the marshmallows and make s\u2019mores. Hiking, fishing, skipping stones, jumping boulders can happen no matter where you lay your head. \n\nExpressing your feelings and thoughts, expectations, and doubts about changing anything might go a long way towards achieving the goal you want to accomplish. \n\nBEST OF IT ALL, OP.   Oh, btw, Please make them have some fried SPAM, on a bun with an egg on top. Add cheese of choice if that is your way. AND- Thin Mint S\u2019mores are dang tasty. Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies with the toasted, roasted, golden brown marshmallow sandwiched between. Scrumptious! \n\nIsn\u2019t it really that we remember the marshmallow torches blazing even as they dropped into the flames. That sister found the Mack Daddy fossil and you found a pine cone.

Being outdoors is just not something I enjoy.  I have a tshirt that says \"Nature makes me itchy\" and it perfectly encapsulates my feelings about everything outside my house.  \n\nMy husband LOVES camping.  He used to go with his dad and he loves taking our kids.  I go, too, because it's important for him and because I can suck it up for few days.  We've learnt to compromise.  I can't deal with the remote camping deal.  My absolute minimum is flushing toilets and hot showers.  So we will often go to campsites that have those facilities or stay in parks.  When he wants to do that sort of camping, I help pack everything up, get the kids organised, make sure they've got sunscreen and wave them goodbye.  If they're going to be away for more than a few days, I'll drive out to spend a day or two with them.  Or just leave them to it.  \n\nThe important thing, though, is I gave it a few tries before I decided that it really wasn't for me.", ">But every spring break **my dad** took me\n\nWas your mom on these trips? Take your kids by yourself if you want them to experience what you had as a kid. However, bare in mind, the trip was a big deal to you because you didn't have other vacations as a kid for comparison in your own life. Your kids have had a different life and might not feel the same way. Trying to replicate nostalgia tends to ruin it and you might not enjoy it now. Your wife is probably not going to do what you want. NAH.\n\nLet me rewrite this. Why isn't my wife letting me drag her along to an experience she doesn't want and will probably hate? Gosh, sir, I have no idea. A compromise is get an RV and then you and the kids go sleep in tents. That way they can go back to the RV if they don't love it. I'm unsure about the summer camp comparison.", "Teardrop trailer manufacturer here: We do not try to sell someone on our trailers if that is not what they want when they go camping. If they want the big RV, THEY WANT THE BIG RV! With the fireplace and separate beds and White Russians on the dining room table. Don't try to sell someone on what they DON'T want. They will not enjoy it. Let Mom have a spa weekend, take kids tent camping. Bond. Just sayin'.", "NTA, but make sure she knows it\u2019s fine if this isn\u2019t her thing and she wants to stay home. Also, I\u2019m not convinced you know what you are getting into here. Camping as an adult with children, especially a solo adult or an adult with an inexperienced co-leader, is a lot of work and requires a lot of planning. I\u2019m a SAHM and basically treat prepping for our camping trips as my full time job for 2 weeks ahead of a trip. I highly recommend starting with a backyard camp out for a night or two, then a long weekend at a local park, then maybe a 4 day trip over a school break with time after to relax and reset, clean all your equipment up and store it properly, etc. especially if you aren\u2019t the one who does the day to say mental load and behind the scenes work for your house and you haven\u2019t been camping since childhood, you have a lot on your plate for this trip.", "My best memories with my dad wher him taking me fishing just us. I think it's beneficial for kids to have alone trips and experiences with each parent because they get to understand you as a singular person and learn about you and how you do things. My dad taught me so much on those fishing trips and i learned alot about how he thinks and began to understand him and how he thinks.

Your wife should be able to do a better job of understanding and supporting what you are trying to do, you are totally right about that. \n\nHowever, you need a little more awareness that you are planning a Spring Break family VACATION.

This might be your idea of fun, but I get the impression it is \u201ccharacter building\u201d for the rest of the family.\n\nSo I would suggest you ease up and find the right occasion and duration for doing this - perhaps not spoiling everyone\u2019s Spring Break, but a 3 day weekend or something.", "NAH, but you're *really* close by stating you will *tell* her that it must be done your way.\n\nListen, I was a Scout as a kid. I've been camping in a tent, on a 2cm-thick foam mat and a sleeping bag. I've been camping in the rain and assembled a tent while it's been pouring down. I did a fourteen-day trip with a bunch of other Scouts just like that. I went with my family on a camp to the beach.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nI'd never do it now as a grown up. I've got the money for a proper bed, and a nice room, with room service. The very idea of lying on a foam mat in a tent, watching out for the bugs and the snakes, is repulsive.\n\nOP, I'm sensing some real resentment here that your wife had such a wealthier upbringing than you, and that she is giving your children a better experience than you had as a child.

She is being controlling and frankly classist.  You need to sit her down and explain you want to do it your way, and she can come or not, but you and kids are going to go tent. You can plan camping her way at another date if she wants to fancy-camp.

She thinks this an instagram weekend\n\nWhen you pitch this idea the best way to explain it is you find an amazing place in the woods, just land, water and hikes.  But you can only bring what you can carry on a back pack.  (You will need to buy new stuff).  The first time you do this you find a drive up place (still middle of nowhere) and bring extras so it looks like you are the one comprising but they still get the experience. You call it back yard camping and have some coolers in the car with food and drink and extra blankets and air mattresses and maybe yard games or movie projector.  \n\nWhen it\u2019s over you give them a mini grade (encouraging though) and ask them if they want to do real camping next time? If they say yes at least now they have an expectation.", "YTA if you TELL her she has to camp your way or else. Your her husband not her parent. There is a compromise somewhere between tent camping and glamour camping.", "I think u need to accept she does not want to do the same camping experience but still wants to be there.

That way she can come and still be comfortable", "Your wording is why YWBTA but I think you are correct; wifey would rather stay home than go without a min level of comfort.  If your looking for advise then look towards an rv or trailer with hot water, furnace, fridge, shower, and a queen sized bed.  You can bring and use tents.", "I think you should take a normal vacation and then next year, at some point that you to agree on, you can take the kids on your own trip like you had as a child.  \n\nIt\u2019s possible that your wife didn\u2019t quite understand what she was agreeing to.

It doesn\u2019t have to be her thing but she could at least try with a good adventurer attitude one week. Get your kids involved in scouting as soon as you are able- you can be very involved and share this bond together. They\u2019ll face a ball and learn a zillion life skills.

Also, encourage her to do something she really enjoys while you and the kids are gone. This could be visiting a spa, touring museums, whatever she likes.\n\nYou didn't say how old your children are. Make sure whatever activities you have in mind are appropriate for their ages, abilities and interests. If you do get to make this trip, listen to your kids. If they enjoy everything, great.

My cousin and her parents only ever went in an RV. Cooked in the RV, showered in the RV, brought more clothes with because there was more room to bring them, brought the tv and radio with, etc. I never wanted to go camping with them, because it wasn't the same, not because I was jealous of them being able to afford an RV. Fifty years later, I still go camping.  Now it is a 5th wheel because I can't sleep on the ground, use showers because my mobility scooter doesn't do well in sand, but I still do 90% of my cooking outdoors because that is what I prefer when camping!!", "Are you being ironic?

I wouldn\u2019t say tell her \u201cdo it this way or else\u201d, but perfectly legit to say to your wife \u201chey, this is what I actually want to do with the kids - if that\u2019s not your thing you\u2019re fine to stay home, but otherwise hop on board with me and help us all enjoy it\u201d.  Also, for all the people saying it\u2019s a huge amount of work, how the hell do you do camping?

For example, you go camping with the kids for two days while she waits for you at a nice hotel/spa near by. \n\nI would not settle for camping in your back yard like some posters are suggesting, tough. 1) while maybe fun, it won't prepare the kids for actual camping and 2) as a fellow urban kid, part of the magic in camping was the adventure of discovering and being inmersed in nature. \n\nAnyway, best of luck, hope you can organice something everyone is happy with, just be open to the possibility of the kids not loving it as much as you do.", "Rent the RV and take a tent with you.

Camping was one of my favorite experiences as a child. My parents took me from the time I was a baby. I still love camping to this day and I took my daughter to her first camping trip when she was 14 months. She\u2019s really enjoyed our camping and canoeing trips and I hope she continues to, but if at some point she decides it\u2019s not for her we\u2019ll of course not force her into our hobbies. I don\u2019t really think there\u2019s an age that\u2019s too young to camp and where I live it\u2019s really normal for families to camp with very young kiddos. \n\nHowever you absolutely must be a good planner and have a backup situation ready if weather conditions become risky. Especially if you have young kids. Our mini van is our first-line backup sleeping option if the tent gets rained out (although I have developed many \u201cfoolproof\u201d methods of staying dry, I am occasionally proved wrong by Mother Nature). I try not to camp when it will be excessively hot or cold out with a small child. I have a lot of fun planning and trying to pack in as minimalist a way as possible while still having all the gear we need including first aid kit. This is fun for me. There are plenty of people who do not find anything fun about it.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t gone camping since you were a kid, I would take the time to just do a one night overnight with some food that doesn\u2019t need to be cooked, some marshmallows if you can make a fire (sometimes there are burn restrictions due to weather or specific park rules, but you can always toast them over a camp stove) and make sure a backup plan is nearby. Just take the girls and not your wife. Don\u2019t make it the whole family vacation. And see if they even enjoy it. Make sure to plan a couple fun activities at the campground that align with their interests. If they like hiking or swimming try to find a camp that has a lake, river, or some private campgrounds even have pools. State parks may or may not always have shower facilities so if that would be important to them even for just an overnight, then you\u2019ll want to consider that.\n\nClearly money isn\u2019t an issue so I\u2019d just go to REI and ask someone to help you with whatever gear you\u2019ll need for a short camping trip that would also be good for up to a week\u2019s camping experience. They can ask you about what kind of camping experience you\u2019re looking for and help you find the gear you need. But if it were me I\u2019d just borrow some gear from a friend if I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to end up using it long term. No sense spending money on something you may only use once if your kids can\u2019t tolerate a single night camping. \n\nIf your kids like it, then you can make it a dad and kids thing until you can either ease your wife into the idea or just continue it as a dad and kiddo bonding time for the rest of time if your wife is steadfastly uninterested.\n\nI love to scuba dive and did try to ease my husband into the idea, but he spent exactly 10 minutes snorkeling and hated it so that was the end of that. His brother is a dive instructor so I\u2019ve got a buddy - no big deal. Families don\u2019t have to do everything together all the time. Besides, someone has to watch the kiddo while I\u2019m underwater.\n\nBig family trips should take everyone\u2019s preferences into consideration but this can also be insufferably difficult if you have a lot of disparate interests. Sometimes it\u2019s best to go with what the most particular people want if you and the others are less picky and save your unique preference for a separate trip with those who will enjoy the same kind of adventure.\n\nTo better ensure a good first-time experience, maybe even find another family with kids that already goes camping that you are friends with and plan a trip with them.

Renting anything from anywhere unless it is some sort of trailer still won't be any sort of solution to these people.", "Their point was \"buying a ton of camping gear might be a waste of money if they never go camping again.\" Renting camping gear one time to see if they like camping is significantly cheaper.\n\nAlso, based on the description of OP's family's other vacations, they aren't exactly hurting for money.", "So she said yes to his idea and then immediately try\u2019s to change it and shoot down his ideas about what the trip should be? She doesn\u2019t want a camping trip she wants another luxurious trip in an RV that is nicer than most hotels. He would like to try a family tradition he enjoyed growing up once and she immediately tried to change it.", "I mean your parents do kind of suck for that. My wife and her siblings parents were the type that didn\u2019t take them on kid vacations to like dis Wu or similar places. If they went on vacations it was just what parents wanted to do and kids just tagged along. Now it was their parents money and they were the adults so they can do what they want but that doesn\u2019t not make them assholes. Whereas my mom did Disney and some vacations for me and then we did trips that weren\u2019t as kid focused. Wife and her sisters are still upset about this years later and feel like they missed out. This and other reasons is why they have a strained relationship with their parents."]}
