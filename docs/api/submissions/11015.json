I never left the state of NY until senior year of Highschool. It didn\u2019t help that I got a sports scholarship to a manhattan private school and I always heard of their luxurious vacations and felt a little jealous.\n\nBut every spring break my dad took me and my two sisters to this camp site in upstate New York. We slept in tents,went fishing, made s\u2019mores and had a great time. \n\nMy wife is from a very wealthy New Jersey suburb and grew up spending vacations abroad or in Florida. Our different upbringings don\u2019t affect us that much usually. We both have very well off jobs and can give our girls a very great life.\n\nUsually we take our kids on luxurious cruises and vacations. But this year I suggested to my wife that on spring break we go camping so I could give the kids a little taste of my childhood and she said yes very excitedly. But as much as I\u2019ve tried to explain to her what I want it to be like she doesn\u2019t understand.\n\nFirst she was looking through these insanely luxurious RV\u2019s with separate rooms and TV\u2019s. I explained that was way more than we needed and we could just sleep in tents. She was appalled at the idea. So then she found this very upscale family camp where we could stay in cabins that were basically mini-mansions and eat in a cafeteria that looked like a 5star restaurant.\n\nI\u2019ve tried to explain as nice as I can that I don\u2019t want this to be a luxurious vacation. I found a nice camp site we can go to but all the lots are outdoor and she was not okay with that. I tried to compromise found a family camp with cabins that were more laid back and she was also grossed out by that.\n\nI feel like she\u2019s not willing to compromise at all and it\u2019s making me sad because she gets to share her childhood and have nostalgia through her experiences with our kids all the time but the second I do it\u2019s a problem. I feel like she\u2019s incapable of relinquishing control and usually I\u2019m ok with that but I wanted this to be my thing.

I imagine your wife was the one meticulously planning your prior luxurious trips, as that\u2019s her fort\u00e9. I\u2019d tell her that you expect her to take a back seat for the planning this time and let you do your thing, just as you have allowed her to do prior times. If she continues to argue about her own comfort level regarding the camping plans you want to make, I think you should go ahead and tell her straight that she isn\u2019t required to come, and that this is something you want to do specifically for yourself so you can bond with your kids YOUR way. Assure her that it\u2019s not like her presence would be a nuisance and that she is more than welcome to join, but that she cannot dictate this specific trip.

You should be able to take your kids on a camping trip the way you are envisioning. \n\n\nHowever, to me, and to many other people, including your wife, that sounds less like a vacation and more like a very, very bad time.

But I will add that you should at least make sure whatever campground you choose has a bathhouse, especially if you ever want her to go camping again.", "NTA and it sounds like part of the problem is you usually let her control things and you don\u2019t mutually make decisions.", "NAH - yet, I think its perfectly fine to not want to go camping. Its just not some people\u2019s thing. This seems more of a miscommunication issue though.", "NAH. You\u2019re conflating two things that don\u2019t necessarily have that much to do with each other. One is sharing your experiences with your kids. You should definitely do that, & I bet even your wife agrees with that. The second is camping. A lot of people don\u2019t like camping. It\u2019s got nothing to do with control or nostalgia or any of that. Many people don\u2019t like sleeping in a tent or cooking outdoors. Suggest that you start small. Let your wife stay home & take the kids by yourself for a couple of nights of camping at a nearby tent campground. See what your kids think of it & how much you like it as an adult. If you have fun, maybe next time your wife will join you.", "NAH. Also just saying do your kids want to go camping in tents? If your kids are used to more luxurious trips they may not want to sleep in tents and just complain the whole time. An RV would be the closest thing to it that they might want to do and you could still do s\u2019mores and the daytime activities.", " I think it'll be a good experience for your kids. It sounds like your wife doesn't care what you want. If it's not fancy, she won't say yes. I would suggest a father daughter trip just the 3 of you, but I can tell your wife won't like it.

If it\u2019s not her thing she can opt out", "NTA  Just leave her home.", "NAH. Take the kids solo. Let your wife stay home where she's comfortable.

She can come or not.", "OP, is this about you or the family? Is it about making a memorable outdoor experience? Is this about sharing your experience with your family? \n\nOP, before you get up in arms about what I am about to say let me preface it with this statement. I have camped in a tent, a pop-up camper, a camper trailer, and cabins. I can clean a latrine, collect firewood, build a fire pit and fire, haul water, use a bathhouse and and outhouse. I can cook on that fire, on a propane stove, and even make an oven out of a box and aluminum foil. \n\nYou might want to ask yourself what you want to convey, share and experience with your family, and why. What is your goal? \n\nWhile you may hanker for the simplicity of a tent, does sleeping a little more comfortably in a pop-up too much of a stretch? If your wife is left out, and it sounds like it is contentious already, how will it affect your children, and yes, even your marriage? \n\nCould you compromise on the sleeping arrangements a little, while encouraging simplicity? You could cook over the fire, tell stories around it and roast the marshmallows and make s\u2019mores. Hiking, fishing, skipping stones, jumping boulders can happen no matter where you lay your head. \n\nExpressing your feelings and thoughts, expectations, and doubts about changing anything might go a long way towards achieving the goal you want to accomplish. \n\nBEST OF IT ALL, OP.   Oh, btw, Please make them have some fried SPAM, on a bun with an egg on top. Add cheese of choice if that is your way. AND- Thin Mint S\u2019mores are dang tasty. Girl Scout Thin Mint cookies with the toasted, roasted, golden brown marshmallow sandwiched between. Scrumptious! \n\nIsn\u2019t it really that we remember the marshmallow torches blazing even as they dropped into the flames. That sister found the Mack Daddy fossil and you found a pine cone.

Being outdoors is just not something I enjoy.  I have a tshirt that says \"Nature makes me itchy\" and it perfectly encapsulates my feelings about everything outside my house.  \n\nMy husband LOVES camping.  He used to go with his dad and he loves taking our kids.  I go, too, because it's important for him and because I can suck it up for few days.  We've learnt to compromise.  I can't deal with the remote camping deal.  My absolute minimum is flushing toilets and hot showers.  So we will often go to campsites that have those facilities or stay in parks.  When he wants to do that sort of camping, I help pack everything up, get the kids organised, make sure they've got sunscreen and wave them goodbye.  If they're going to be away for more than a few days, I'll drive out to spend a day or two with them.  Or just leave them to it.  \n\nThe important thing, though, is I gave it a few tries before I decided that it really wasn't for me.", ">But every spring break **my dad** took me\n\nWas your mom on these trips? Take your kids by yourself if you want them to experience what you had as a kid. However, bare in mind, the trip was a big deal to you because you didn't have other vacations as a kid for comparison in your own life. Your kids have had a different life and might not feel the same way. Trying to replicate nostalgia tends to ruin it and you might not enjoy it now. Your wife is probably not going to do what you want. NAH.\n\nLet me rewrite this. Why isn't my wife letting me drag her along to an experience she doesn't want and will probably hate? Gosh, sir, I have no idea. A compromise is get an RV and then you and the kids go sleep in tents. That way they can go back to the RV if they don't love it. I'm unsure about the summer camp comparison.", "Teardrop trailer manufacturer here: We do not try to sell someone on our trailers if that is not what they want when they go camping. If they want the big RV, THEY WANT THE BIG RV! With the fireplace and separate beds and White Russians on the dining room table. Don't try to sell someone on what they DON'T want. They will not enjoy it. Let Mom have a spa weekend, take kids tent camping. Bond. Just sayin'.", "NTA, but make sure she knows it\u2019s fine if this isn\u2019t her thing and she wants to stay home. Also, I\u2019m not convinced you know what you are getting into here. Camping as an adult with children, especially a solo adult or an adult with an inexperienced co-leader, is a lot of work and requires a lot of planning. I\u2019m a SAHM and basically treat prepping for our camping trips as my full time job for 2 weeks ahead of a trip. I highly recommend starting with a backyard camp out for a night or two, then a long weekend at a local park, then maybe a 4 day trip over a school break with time after to relax and reset, clean all your equipment up and store it properly, etc. especially if you aren\u2019t the one who does the day to say mental load and behind the scenes work for your house and you haven\u2019t been camping since childhood, you have a lot on your plate for this trip.", "My best memories with my dad wher him taking me fishing just us. I think it's beneficial for kids to have alone trips and experiences with each parent because they get to understand you as a singular person and learn about you and how you do things. My dad taught me so much on those fishing trips and i learned alot about how he thinks and began to understand him and how he thinks.

Your wife should be able to do a better job of understanding and supporting what you are trying to do, you are totally right about that. \n\nHowever, you need a little more awareness that you are planning a Spring Break family VACATION.

This might be your idea of fun, but I get the impression it is \u201ccharacter building\u201d for the rest of the family.\n\nSo I would suggest you ease up and find the right occasion and duration for doing this - perhaps not spoiling everyone\u2019s Spring Break, but a 3 day weekend or something.", "NAH, but you're *really* close by stating you will *tell* her that it must be done your way.\n\nListen, I was a Scout as a kid. I've been camping in a tent, on a 2cm-thick foam mat and a sleeping bag. I've been camping in the rain and assembled a tent while it's been pouring down. I did a fourteen-day trip with a bunch of other Scouts just like that. I went with my family on a camp to the beach.\n\nAnd you know what?\n\nI'd never do it now as a grown up. I've got the money for a proper bed, and a nice room, with room service. The very idea of lying on a foam mat in a tent, watching out for the bugs and the snakes, is repulsive.\n\nOP, I'm sensing some real resentment here that your wife had such a wealthier upbringing than you, and that she is giving your children a better experience than you had as a child.

She is being controlling and frankly classist.  You need to sit her down and explain you want to do it your way, and she can come or not, but you and kids are going to go tent. You can plan camping her way at another date if she wants to fancy-camp.

She thinks this an instagram weekend\n\nWhen you pitch this idea the best way to explain it is you find an amazing place in the woods, just land, water and hikes.  But you can only bring what you can carry on a back pack.  (You will need to buy new stuff).  The first time you do this you find a drive up place (still middle of nowhere) and bring extras so it looks like you are the one comprising but they still get the experience. You call it back yard camping and have some coolers in the car with food and drink and extra blankets and air mattresses and maybe yard games or movie projector.  \n\nWhen it\u2019s over you give them a mini grade (encouraging though) and ask them if they want to do real camping next time? If they say yes at least now they have an expectation.", "YTA if you TELL her she has to camp your way or else. Your her husband not her parent. There is a compromise somewhere between tent camping and glamour camping.", "I think u need to accept she does not want to do the same camping experience but still wants to be there.

That way she can come and still be comfortable", "Your wording is why YWBTA but I think you are correct; wifey would rather stay home than go without a min level of comfort.  If your looking for advise then look towards an rv or trailer with hot water, furnace, fridge, shower, and a queen sized bed.  You can bring and use tents.", "I think you should take a normal vacation and then next year, at some point that you to agree on, you can take the kids on your own trip like you had as a child.  \n\nIt\u2019s possible that your wife didn\u2019t quite understand what she was agreeing to.

It doesn\u2019t have to be her thing but she could at least try with a good adventurer attitude one week. Get your kids involved in scouting as soon as you are able- you can be very involved and share this bond together. They\u2019ll face a ball and learn a zillion life skills.

Also, encourage her to do something she really enjoys while you and the kids are gone. This could be visiting a spa, touring museums, whatever she likes.\n\nYou didn't say how old your children are. Make sure whatever activities you have in mind are appropriate for their ages, abilities and interests. If you do get to make this trip, listen to your kids. If they enjoy everything, great.

My cousin and her parents only ever went in an RV. Cooked in the RV, showered in the RV, brought more clothes with because there was more room to bring them, brought the tv and radio with, etc. I never wanted to go camping with them, because it wasn't the same, not because I was jealous of them being able to afford an RV. Fifty years later, I still go camping.  Now it is a 5th wheel because I can't sleep on the ground, use showers because my mobility scooter doesn't do well in sand, but I still do 90% of my cooking outdoors because that is what I prefer when camping!!", "Are you being ironic?

I grew up camping with my family (no bathrooms, only tents we brought with us etc) and it\u2019s some of the best memories I have.  With all the connectedness we have now, I think experiences like that are even more important now, especially for kids. They are never disconnected from the world, and knowing how to be alone or without that lifeline is a coping skills so many kids will never know.

We explored the East Coast of America while staying in campgrounds that ranged from fantastic to \u201cuh let\u2019s find another place ASAP.\u201d While I didn\u2019t always enjoy the camping trips (tensions can run hiiiiigh in a 19ft pop-up), it introduced me to groups of people I normally would never have met otherwise. I met (and saw) people who were in the same socioeconomic bracket, above (ohhh those luxurious RVs), and below (I\u2019ll never forget a family of 4 who lived in a pop-up camper at a campsite in North Carolina). \n\nIt\u2019s wonderful that you want to ensure your kids have a great childhood with 5 star experiences.

As someone who abhors tent camping, may I suggest a pop-up camper as a potential alternative? \ud83e\udd23\n\nETA: As a side note, I lived in an upper middle class neighborhood in high school. Most families settled  there for their kids\u2019 entire education and the lack of self-awareness, limited worldview, and entitlement was astounding.

You got a fucking car- be grateful, you little shit. I also remember asking a teacher what to do if you didn\u2019t have the internet (this was 2001: my family had just relocated to the area and hadn\u2019t had time to find an internet provider) and a fellow student exclaimed, \u201cWhat, are you poor?\u201d \n\nSo, yeah. Highly encourage you to speak with your wife about how while you\u2019re grateful you\u2019re able to afford such incredible trips for your family, you want to show your kids there are other ways to make memories, pass along one of your favorite traditions to them, and broadening their minds.", "I wouldn\u2019t make an ultimatum.

I'm pretty sure my joints would not appreciate me if I tried that now.\n\nAlso, taking kids camping _sucks_. One kid is going to hate bugs. Another is going to be afraid of the dark. Another is going to need to use the latrine at 2 a.m. Two of my friends were counselors at a sleep away camp, and it is _rough_. Maybe OP should consider renting a cabin at some place like Bear Mountain State Park before roughing it.", "Peeing in the woods can be hard though. And personally I don\u2019t enjoy feeling that exposed. I also seem to always start my period early when we go on camping trips. It sucks to have to scuffle out of bed and try to find a place to change/throw out your tampon. And long hair can get tangled/greasy/hold the smell of smoke more intensely than shorter hair.\n\nI do enjoy camping, but I think I would probably enjoy it more as a man than a woman."]}
