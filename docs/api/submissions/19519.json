You /DO/ clean the kitchen. They should have listened to you when you said you clean and do the dishwasher etc when you use the kitchen. You even took on the extra chores they gave you without saying anything, and they're not treating you any better. Happy you're looking for a solo!", "NTA - what justification have they given, seeing as you already clean up the mess you make?", "NTA   \nYou're honestly doing too much. Sit down with them and ask why you have to clean up their mess. And why are people messing up the kitchen and not cleaning up after themselves. When you live with other people, you have to make it clear to them... make a mess, clean it up. There is no need to divide that chore. It means doing what you do. Clean everything you use immediately, or at least within a reasonable time and don't expect others to clean for you. They're actually the ones being lazy by trying to get you to do more when you are already taking care of your fair share. The trash? That's something everyone has to take a turn doing. There's no way short of dumping the trash out and going through it to see who threw more in each week, so one of you takes out one bag, then the next bag gets taken out by the next person, and so on until it goes full circle.", "Info: are you sure their problem is only the kitchen being dirty? Do you participate in the household chores more than mopping once or twice, cleaning after your own mess and taking care of the thrash? Do you help cleaning the bathroom, toilet or living-room, for instance? If they have to do everything I can understand why they're mad - you're living here, you should help too. If you do your share and you're just not cleaning the kitchen since you're not using it, that's different.\n\nI'm not judging btw; just genuinely asking.", "NTA if everyone was cleaning up after themselves in the kitchen it wouldn't get messy. I have a similar issue with a few of my roommates. I'll clean what use when I make my one meal a week and clean the floor and counters but two of my roommates will dump their dishes in the sink and expect someone else to clean it. Or drop food on the floor and walk away. Just remind them that if they clean up after they use the kitchen it wouldn't get dirty and leave it at that.", "NTA\n\nTell them if they cleaned up after themselves like you do then there wouldn't be these issues", "NTA. You're not obligated to clean the shared kitchen if it affects your sensory issues. You're doing your part by cleaning up after yourself and contributing to the dishwasher and floor sweeping. If your roommates have an issue with the kitchen being dirty, they should clean it themselves or come up with a cleaning schedule that works for everyone. Assigning you extra chores is unfair and only creates more tension. It's good that you're looking for a solo rental - it's important to prioritize your own well-being.", "Hmmmmmn. Tough one. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole really, but I don\u2019t think they necessarily are either. Use the kitchen or not, I think you still have a duty to help keep it clean. If you were living with friends it might be different and you could have an agreement as they\u2019re your friends and have that extra level of understanding. As your roommates (I assume) are not friends, they don\u2019t really need to take this into account. I\u2019m trying to think of a parallel to this: if I had a housemate who only showered once a week (gross) I\u2019d still expect them to clean it on their cleaning day (once every 5 weeks). How does the cleaning rota work for you guys (if you have one?)", "Going against the grain but ESH. I think them perhaps more so than you. It sounds like they are generally messy and that's always difficult to deal with but when living in shared spaces I'd say it's probably a fair expectation to both clean up after yourself AND participate in a more thorough clean on a regular basis. If you're unable to participate in the latter then substituting that chore for another seems like a fair compromise. Them not cleaning up after themselves is something that should be addressed. \n\nThe point may be moot since you want to live on your own but modifying the cleaning rota to weekly, instead of monthly would probably make a big difference.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your roommates remind me of a couple of nightmare ones I lived with where they'd make a mess and expect everyone else to clean it up because \"we should split chores equally\".  Ah no, splitting chores can be equally agreed but I am not going to clean up a mess you made deliberately and left for someone else to do.", "NTA. I'm also neurodivergent and clean up after *my* mess. A couple tips until you get your own place: \n\nGet a differently colored set of dishes and silverware that are only yours. I found a set of [rainbow silverware](https://www.amazon.com/Flatware-Silverware-Stainless-Tableware-Dishwasher/dp/B08RYQ1XYT/ref=mp_s_a_1_1_sspa?crid=WXLJBRVEME0I&keywords=rainbow+silverware+set&qid=1686478485&sprefix=rainbow+sil%2Caps%2C255&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzNjJCMjRDSkpRNksxJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMzUxOTQ0MlBISExZT1gyTzdPWSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMzI5MzAxQ0pOR1lCTThETEhaJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfcGhvbmVfc2VhcmNoX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) that were clearly mine. I washed and then stored in my space, and only used them. Same with dishes and mugs. If you can get a basic nonstick pan and a cooking pot, as well as your own clearly marked containers, all the better. \n\nIf it makes it easier, consider buying a little dorm microwave for your space. When cooking, take before and after pictures of the space when you cook. If it's really bad, maybe get a hot plate you can use in your own space.\n\nDon't let them bully you into cleaning their mess.", "Flatmate politics are always tricky for outsiders to gauge since everyone has such different expectations in terms of cleanliness. These people appear to be a lot messier than you and are happy using a comparatively filthier kitchen. I'd say if you cannot clean the kitchen due to sensory issues then swapping that task for another seems like a fair alternative. Regardless, they really should be cleaning up after themselves after every use. So for that reason I'll go with NTA.", "NTA\n\nStop cleaning up after yourself for a few days and when they something act confused \u201cOh, I thought since I was the only one doing this chore instead of cleaning the kitchen, I thought that meant I didn\u2019t have to clean the kitchen any longer\u2026\u201d", "NTA\n\nAnd I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re bitching about it now, you told them what was up and you clean after yourself. \n\nBut it\u2019s good you\u2019re looking for a solo rental - you\u2019ll feel much better if you don\u2019t have to deal with their weirdness", "I\u2019m going to go with a mild ESH here. The roommates have been told about your sensory issues, and you say you clean up the mess you personally make. \n\nIt seems like the roommates are holding a kind of weird double-standard over you with this. On the other hand, if you have a psychological aversion to cleaning a shared kitchen, it would definitely behoove you to live singly. Which you said you are preparing to do, so your AH quotient is less than theirs.\n\nOverall, it just seems like a difference in expectations that you are in the process of addressing.\n\nEdit: spelling", "Nope NTA. And PLEASE do not start cleaning after them because then it\u2019ll just get worse. I had moved in an apartment with 2 of my friends and one of them was very particular about cooking everyday at home. The thing was she would always leave all the dishes and pots in the sink stating that she cooked for all so we clean. I am a picky eater and didn\u2019t particularly enjoy what she would cook(she never asked what we wanted and we never asked her to cook for us in the first place) so I ate maybe 3-4 times a month of what she cooked and still me and the other roomie kept on doing dishes for like a couple months. After that we obviously started getting annoyed, I literally had stopped eating anything she cooked at all, and would do my own dishes after cooking simple things for myself like egg or pasta. \n\nAt one point because we hadn\u2019t been doing dishes, she didn\u2019t even care for like a week and then started asking us why wouldn\u2019t we clean up since we have the time(she had morning shifts) but technically we all worked same number of hours so she came home early. When we told her she should do some dishes too since we honestly eat takeaway a lot of times and we do leave our stuff clean, she started crying and saying that she still cooks for us because she wants us to eat good home food.( at this point she was taking the leftovers in her lunch since I literally didn\u2019t eat) I moved out after like 5 months of living together but my roomie tells me the same shit went on for the whole year they lived together.", "NTA at all. It seems like that is a very common problem with roomates tho. In my case I did give in and regularly deep cleaned the kitchen (I was the only one doing it) because I can\u2018t even think about handling food in a dirty and sometimes even filthy environment. I told them multiple times that I feel very uncomfortable with the situation and that it would be a whole lot easier if everyone just put away their own stuff. They basically told me that they don\u2018t have a problem with it and that if I\u2018m the only one feeling uncomfortable, it would be fair if I would be the one cleaning it.\n\nI was very glad moving out lol", "No, you're NTA.

They don't deserve it.", "[deleted]", "YTA in the sense that cleaning to the point of \"the way I found it\" isn't cleaning it. Clean it until it's clean, others' mess as well as yours.", "Basically that I'm selfish because someone cleans the whole kitchen every couple of days. Essentially everyone cooks and barely cleans up until two or so days in the mess gets unbearable and someone just cleans the whole thing. I refuse to do that.", "Fair question. So we have monthly, organized cleaning days. Sometimes people aren't home on cleaning day but I always am, because of the tension. I usually clean the main bathroom and laundry which is one of the bigger jobs. Aside from cleaning day people are usually just cleaning the kitchen, and I'm not, so I get that that's why it might look bad.", "The (kind of) beautiful part here is that most of the kitchenware is actually mine. I moved in here years ago with friends who have since moved cities. I was the only one who had previously lived out of home so I had kitchen supplies. My current roommates don't know that the majority of the pots, pans, plates, silverware etc. actually belongs to me and is not just \"left-over\" from previous tenants. When I leave I think they'll be left with one pan, a handful of decorative plates/mugs, an airfryer and not much else.", "Counter: Is being sneered at for not being a doormat a good way to conduct a relationship?", "Genuinely curious, what's your justification for me cleaning everyone else's mess? Basically, everyone has an unspoken pact to not clean and then rotate the big kitchen clean every couple of days, depending on who gets fed up first. I clean up after myself, so I don't participate.", "Yeah, I can see your point, and I was initially in that headspace as well. However, it seems like the roommates aren\u2019t too concerned about the cleanliness of the kitchen in general until it gets to a \u2018can\u2019t-stand-it\u2019 level. It\u2019s kind of a weird situation. In my mind, I see a trashed kitchen where one person comes in, prepares their food with a plate, knife and fork, cleans only that plate, knife and fork, and then leaves the rest of the kitchen trashed. I personally wouldn\u2019t be able to stand leaving the kitchen like that, but I also don\u2019t have sensory issues.", "I stand slightly corrected, I misread that the kitchen is occasionally your job. Nevertheless, it makes no sense to do a half-assed job. Do you separate your trash from others' before tossing out the bag?", "You\u2019re definitely NTA. It sounds as if you aren\u2019t compatible housemates. If they will, have a sit down chat with them about it. If they won\u2019t concede (you definitely shouldn\u2019t), then you might need to try and find somewhere else to live. I really hated house shares for mainly cleaning reasons, so you have my sympathy", "Then NTA. They should clean their own mess instead of dumping everything* on your shoulders.\n\nMaybe it's time to be petty and just do what you have to do instead of taking their part of the cleaning because they're not here tho.\n\nEdit: spelling lol", "Even better. Prove a point. All your belongings now live in your space. They are complaining about using *your stuff* ***for free***. Let them enjoy their airfryer and decorative mugs while you can still watch. \n\n\nAnd explain you packed everything away because they made you feel uncomfortable.

And I won't give them a heads up about the kitchenware, or the other things they think \"belong\" to the house (the ironing board, iron, sofa, vacuum, TV... there's probably more I'm forgetting). So that should be fun.", "It will. Move things out when everyone is gone, though. Start moving small things, then get a couple friends or movers to get everything big out when the apartment is empty. Avoid the arguments. \n\n\nIn my experience, the vacuum will be the biggest blow.", "NTA, Everybody should be cleaning as they go the same way you do \n\nWhat kind of mess is this? Not wiping down counters? Leaving dishes? \n\nPeople can\u2019t just be leaving that to build up ?!?

There are two ways to go about cleaning with housemates, either everyone cleans up after themselves on a daily basis, or you have rotating (weekly?) shifts where one person cleans EVERYONES stuff that one week/shift.\n\nALL your other roommates prefer a rotating shift, you prefer cleaning after yourself every time yourself. You cant be roommates with everybody, some people are not compatible.\n\nIts also possible to combine the two, meaning everyone cleans after themselves as best they can, but you still rotate weekly to do a \"deep clean\" for the little things no one feels responsible for.\n\nNeither of you are technically in the wrong, but they seem to be using it as an excuse to dump more work on you.
