This past year has been hard financially. My partner went through a mental health burn out and finding out he (26M) is diagnosed with ADHD and a mild case of Autism. Nothing wrong with that of course, but I was supporting us financially while he was taking the time he needed to focus on his mental health. He didn't work for 8 months, and during one of the hardest years financially speaking (inflation, COVID come back, etc). We're still recovering and catching up on the debt we've accumulated overtime, and the bills between us still aren't 50/50, but he contributes as much as he can with an amount we're both comfortable with. On top of that, her wedding is in another state across the country (I'm in Montana and her wedding is in Michigan). I'm not really close to her anymore, other than the odd heart to heart once or twice a year, but we were best friends from age 12-19. I don't think I can afford to go, and frankly, I think it might be a little much to ask of someone to ask who isn't someone I'm that close to anymore. She did ask me a while ago and I did say yes, but financially we're just catching up again and having to pay for everything to go to this wedding (flight, accomodations, food, bachelorette party stuff, dress for the reception/wedding, etc) isn't really worth it in my opinion for someone I'm not that close to anymore.
