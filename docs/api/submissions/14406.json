Now Lauren is geniunely one of the worst behaved kids I have ever ever seen. I love kids which makes it all the worst because Lauren is just a little terror who throws constant tantrums, never listens to anything you say, and any attempt to discipline her gets you yelled at by my sister. She just refuses to do anything and it's driving me crazy! Under normal circumstances I'd just kick them out of my house but sis is jobless and refuses to work so I know they're gonna wind up on the streets so don't really have much of a choice.\n\n\nAnyway today was probably the worst tantrum I've seen Lauren throw. I needed to run some errands and sis tagged along with Lauren. I usually say no to Lauren tagging along since I do not trust her in public spaces but sis demanded it and I don't have the energy to argue with her. Anyway I'm about to check out after I got everything when Lauren plops a toy she wanted into the cart to which I tell her, very calmly, that unfortunately she can't have that but I'll keep a mental note of if it for a later time. She demands we get it but I tell her no again and this sets Lauren off as she starts demanding louder and louder. Noticing people starting to stare, I try to descalate but while my sister just stares into space and plays on her phone ignoring all this, Lauren proceeds to have a screaming meltdown. Laying on the ground thrashing her arms and just screaming I WANT IT IWANT IT over and over. I didn't even make it to the register, I just stopped Lauren up and ran her back to the car before causing more of a scene.\n\n\nBy the time we got home, I wanted to cry. I was so embarrassed and just frustrated that this little monster has been making my life hell for 2 years, that this behavior was only going to get worse. I took Lauren inside while my sister just ignored her screaming and crying her head off and sat her down to do what my sister wouldn't. I was firm but fair. I said \"what you did today was unacceptable. We do not act that way when we don't get what we want. I'm very disappointed in you and how you acted. Here's what I want you to do. Go to your room and stay there until further notice. I'm taking all your toys and games until you earn them back. Understand?\"\n\n\nSure enough my sister finally stops pretending we don't exist and demands to know why I talked to her daughter like that which results in the following exchange:\n\nSis: \"YOU DO NOT SPEAK TO HER THAT WAY. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT\"\n\nMe: \"I wouldn't have to if you-\"\n\nSis: \"SHUT UP! YOU DONT TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY KID!\"\n\nMe: \"So what happened today was just fine in your eyes?\"\n\nSis: \"You should have given her what she wanted. You're traumatising her!\"\n\n\nI knew I wasn't going to get anywhere with this so I just removed myself from the conversation before I started getting a migraine.

Now. 7 is too old for this behavior.", "NTA at all. I think we can guess why they kicked her out. I agree with the other posters who say your house, your rules and to get your sister into therapy if at all possible. Give her and yourself a deadline by which she'll be gone, and stick to it. Why should you sacrifice your sanity and peace for an adult who refuses to do anything for herself or her child? If they end up homeless, get CPS involved. Your poor, horribly-behaved niece is in desparate need of boundaries and structure. While they are under your roof, it appears you have to be the \"bad guy\". You may want to seek therapy yourself for help in managing this situation and setting boundaries and rules in your own home. Good luck, OP!", "You need to put some serious boundaries and limits in place for your sister at this point, tell her she has x amount of time to find a job and get a place of her own or she will be evicted, honestly draw up the paperwork to show her how serious you are because you\u2019ve let yourself become your sisters doormat and it needs to stop immediately, she also needs to start following rules of the house or that date is going to come sooner. Do not give in to her tantrums, her guilt tripping or anything because she will undoubtedly try. If she doesn\u2019t want to be homeless she can go to work and earn a living. Let her know she is on her last thread with you and if it breaks your done and she can figure it out for herself and go to a shelter. You need to stop setting yourself on fire to keep others warm and start being a little more selfish.", "Than it is even more her fault. Set a meeting, make a thought which rules you need them to follow (job, payments, rules for Lauren, behaviour at home/outside), and tell them the consequences. If they won't follow your rules they can sleep on the streets. Start with light punishments like disconnect them from WiFi, Disney+ or stuff your sister wastes her time with. Lauren throws a tantrum? No TV, for both. Sister on her phone all the time? If you pay her phone bills than cancel them.\nGo on till they behave or leave.

This is no way to live your life.  Take your life back and evict her.  There are plenty of social programs available if she doesn\u2019t want to get off her ass.", "Yikes. Definitely NTA and sorry you have to deal with that. You\u2019re showing a ton of love and support for your sister, but at some point, she has to take responsibility. That will be very hard, I wish you all the best.", "YTA for letting your sister use your good nature this way.\n\nSeriously. Your sister is taking advantage of you and this is not okay. And she should be raising her kid, which she very obviously isn't.\n\nI understand that it's difficult for you, but you need to put your foot down. Either your sister and your niece start acting like decent human beings or you kick them out.", "What the hell is the relevance of that stupid comment", "More the legal side of things.  She's been living there and getting her mail there.  She will have to serve her sister with an eviction notice through the courts.  So, one written warning of \"you have x days to do this or I am evicting you\" then she goes to court to get the eviction done.", "Is she in school?! Does she display these behaviors at school?", "Ah ok. In India we don't have anything like squatters rights, so normally such things don't pop into my head immediately. \n\nThough yes, it is quite a painful procedure to evict unruly tenants. I fought a 10 yr long case to evict a tenant. Though I won and recouped all my losses, including selling the said flat at above market rate, it was still a painful period.", "I\u2019m sure she does, but have you ever seen what parents will do to a teacher that tries to discipline one of there students?", "Probably. But the teacher at least doesn't have mom standing at the side of the class interfering, so it's also possible to bring a kid who has this kind of home life around, assuming you don't have too many in a single class.\n\nKids like this are exhausting to teachers because the teacher has to undo their habits. They typically take multiple days to become functional in a classroom after every school holiday.", "This child has absolutely displayed this behavior in school.  I  would bet all the money I don't have that all of the teachers and paras and administrators know about her.", "I have spent decades working with kids, often with behavioral issues.  I guarantee that there have been meetings about this kid. This child needs intervention immediately."]}
