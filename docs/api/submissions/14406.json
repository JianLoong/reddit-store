Now Lauren is geniunely one of the worst behaved kids I have ever ever seen. I love kids which makes it all the worst because Lauren is just a little terror who throws constant tantrums, never listens to anything you say, and any attempt to discipline her gets you yelled at by my sister. She just refuses to do anything and it's driving me crazy! Under normal circumstances I'd just kick them out of my house but sis is jobless and refuses to work so I know they're gonna wind up on the streets so don't really have much of a choice.\n\n\nAnyway today was probably the worst tantrum I've seen Lauren throw. I needed to run some errands and sis tagged along with Lauren. I usually say no to Lauren tagging along since I do not trust her in public spaces but sis demanded it and I don't have the energy to argue with her. Anyway I'm about to check out after I got everything when Lauren plops a toy she wanted into the cart to which I tell her, very calmly, that unfortunately she can't have that but I'll keep a mental note of if it for a later time. She demands we get it but I tell her no again and this sets Lauren off as she starts demanding louder and louder. Noticing people starting to stare, I try to descalate but while my sister just stares into space and plays on her phone ignoring all this, Lauren proceeds to have a screaming meltdown. Laying on the ground thrashing her arms and just screaming I WANT IT IWANT IT over and over. I didn't even make it to the register, I just stopped Lauren up and ran her back to the car before causing more of a scene.\n\n\nBy the time we got home, I wanted to cry. I was so embarrassed and just frustrated that this little monster has been making my life hell for 2 years, that this behavior was only going to get worse. I took Lauren inside while my sister just ignored her screaming and crying her head off and sat her down to do what my sister wouldn't. I was firm but fair. I said \"what you did today was unacceptable. We do not act that way when we don't get what we want. I'm very disappointed in you and how you acted. Here's what I want you to do. Go to your room and stay there until further notice. I'm taking all your toys and games until you earn them back. Understand?\"\n\n\nSure enough my sister finally stops pretending we don't exist and demands to know why I talked to her daughter like that which results in the following exchange:\n\nSis: \"YOU DO NOT SPEAK TO HER THAT WAY. YOU HAVE NO RIGHT\"\n\nMe: \"I wouldn't have to if you-\"\n\nSis: \"SHUT UP! YOU DONT TELL ME HOW TO RAISE MY KID!\"\n\nMe: \"So what happened today was just fine in your eyes?\"\n\nSis: \"You should have given her what she wanted. You're traumatising her!\"\n\n\nI knew I wasn't going to get anywhere with this so I just removed myself from the conversation before I started getting a migraine.

Do not give in to her tantrums, her guilt tripping or anything because she will undoubtedly try. If she doesn\u2019t want to be homeless she can go to work and earn a living.

It seems like your sister doesn't exactly care for her kid and raising her and just wishes to take the easiest rout out of doing any actual parenting, based on this.", "NTA however you need to stop allowing this. What YOU allow will continue. Let her be homeless, that\u2019s a consequence of not working. There would not be a child living under my roof that acted like that, with a jobless mom who won\u2019t parent. Absolutely not.", "You need to kick this mf out your sister sucks so bad", "In what depths of an outer realm do people just \"refuse to work?\" Wtf? I can understand if you're unable to work, but to refuse? Who pays for your stuff? Just tell the niece to give it to her mother to buy.", "KICK. HER. OUT. she had TWO YEARS to step up. She needs a hard slap to realize she is not a little kid herself when she\u2019s got a CHILD. \n\nIf I were you, I would call a social worker and say I\u2019m worried about possible child neglect and to help your sister get resources.", "NTA- time to let your sister know the free rides over. Time to get a job and begin process of finding her own place, until then as this is your house she and Lauren will both follow your rules or they can leave. Put your foot down, this sounds utterly ridiculous.", "Not only were you right to discipline this child, but you would be right getting them both out of your place. You should not be responsible for your sister and her monster child. Time to give your sister a deadline to be out of your home. She's counting on you feeling sorry for her and not making her leave. You are enabling her mooching and it needs to stop. Unless your sister is mentally incompetent/stupid/or both, she will figure out a way to survive. Personally, I would have left your sister and the screaming kid in the store, got in my car and drove off.", "NTA but OP grow a backbone or nothing is going to change. It\u2019s your house not your sisters so if she doesn\u2019t abide by your rules then she leaves. If she ends up homeless then that\u2019s on her.", "op=NTA\n\nbut you need to evict her.  Give her decent notice, but there is NO reason you need to be made miserable for life.  She needs to get public assistance or a job.  I don't care which.  But it's NOT your responsibility.\n\nEither that or she sign an agreement that you have the right to discipline her child when she's in your house or under your care(which includes public spaces like grocery stores).\n\nSTOP making yourself a martyr to your sister's laziness(in parenting and financially).", "omg NTA but you are acting like a doormat letting this go on in your house for two years. She won't find a job because she thinks you won't ever kick her out. You need to either a) give her a deadline to get out or b) require her to get a job by a certain date in order to stay and otherwise she'll be kicked out.", "Forget the deadline, give her a week to vacate. \n\nYour mental health is suffering HORRIBLY because you're enabling your sister", "NTA. but truly, you need to read the comments here. You're allowing your sister and niece to walk all over you, and they need an ultimatum. 60 days or however many you want to make it, and they have to leave. She will find someone else to leech off or a shelter and a social worker to get her a job. If you don't, she will drain you and ruin your life. And never leave.", "Right here. For example, \u201cYou\u2019ve got until M/D to find a job. Otherwise, I\u2019m kicking you out. I have nothing to lose from you leaving. You want to stay? Then get a job and you AND your daughter follow the rules of MY house that I own and pay for.\u201d", "So OP has to continue to be a doormat - why exactly?", "Clearly your sister's behavior and her child's behavior are likely why she got kicked out. You are NTA for giving reasonable boundaries to a child. Your sister is an unfit parent and she needs some firm boundaries. If she cannot get a job and start parenting her child, then you have every right to kick her out. Sister is using you, and not at all trying to be mature or adult. It's not traumatizing for a child to not get a toy they want in a store. Maybe look up some family friendly shelters, because if you don't set boundaries, you will suffer.", "Why exactly are you putting up with this?", "Why are you letting her treat you this way? Why are you allowing her to pay no rent for years? Why are you allowing her to continue to live with you when she behaves this way? If she ends up homeless that is her own doing because she refuses to grow up, work, and parent her child. Lay down the law and let her know she has X amount of time to move out (so that she can save up and move out). In the mean time she is to discipline her child and she and her child need to follow house rules (which you can write out and put on the fridge and will include chores, discipline, respect towards you, etc) or the move out date will be moved up to immediately.", "If that\u2019s what you took from what I wrote, YTA.", "How old is this child? The OP says seven but this is not how a second grader unless she has a lot of problems.", "A seven-grader with parents who enable their bad behaviour can absolutely act like this.", "This has nothing to do with squatters rights. She was a tenant", "NTA\n\nIf your sister doesn't disciple her kid, someone else will eventually. I took that approach with my brother's kid when I found her harassing my dog.", "NTA, you all have a co-dependent relationship. You need to find a way to disconnect and let her stand on her own.", "NTA. I get shes your sister. Things like this are always hard when it comes to family. But you're enabling her, and  essentially harming that child in the long run (I know it's not necessarily your fault. She won't let you discipline the kid.) \nShe refuses to work. She refuses to PARENT her child. She's making your life hell. Does she contribute ANYTHING  at all..? Like..even some housework..? \n\nHonestly, as hard as it may be for you, you need to evict her. Go file an eviction with the courts (60 days. 90 if you wanna be generous), and let her know she has that many days to get a job, get her own place, and figure her shit out. Don't let her guilt trip or manipulate you (she will likely try). If she doesn't make any progress by the given date, oh well. That's a her problem. Find available shelter and give her their contact information/location. \n\nIf you don't do something now (or soon, at least), it's just going to continue. It will not get better. I'm not really big on the \"tough love\" way of things, but its absolutely necessary here. She has to learn. Whether she wants to make it easy, or harder on herself, if up to her. And whatever happens is a result of her own choices and actions, and she'll need to take accountability.  \n\nAlso, you're a pretty good person for trying to help her, and her daughter. You did what you could for 2 YEARS. Most would of told her to fuck off and get out in less than 1 with how you said she is. So don't beat yourself up, or feel bad. Especially if things don't go well for her. As I said, she needs to be an adult, and take accountability. \n\nI truly wish you the best of luck, OP.", "Nta give her 30 days to get out for being a crap parent and speaking to you like crap in your own house.", "Your sister is enabling her child and you\u2019re enabling your sister. You\u2019re in no way shape or form helping her. She\u2019s leeching off you and you allow it. How can your niece respect you when her own mother doesn\u2019t? \n\nI don\u2019t get people who complain about things when they\u2019re not doing anything to help their situation.", "Get a backbone. Stop giving in just because it's easier. Tell them these are the rules. Hell, spell it out on a colorful chart with stickers and shiney stars. Then stick to it no matter what. Sister needs to get a job AND discipline her kid or move out. You are enabling their bad behaviors.", "Just bc you\u2019re putting up with this crap makes you YTA. Kick them out. If they are homeless it\u2019s your sister\u2019s fault. You are doing neither one of them favors by coddling them & allowing this lazy & shit behavior. \n\nFor not giving that AH kid a toy & disciplining her, you\u2019re NTA.", "You do have a choice. Kick them out. \n\nNTA. You're being used and abused.", "NTA\nYour house, your rules. Lay down the law to your sistsr. You must have the patience of a saint to pur up with this for 2 years. She wouldn't have lasted 2 months in my house, sister or not.", "Oh My NTA-\n\nYou are actually doing Lauren a favor, because if she doesn't get the discipline and guidelines she needs she will not have friends, will grow up lonely and probably angry and a leech like your sister.  Why does your sister think she should get everything she wants when she doesn't work for it?  Your sister is taking advantage of you. She KNOWS you won't throw her out as long as she doesn't have a job - so why get a job?  You are supporting yourself, her and her child. A child she really doesn't seem to pay attention to...at all until it suits her. \n\nTime to set some hard boundaries with your sister.  She is like this in part because you (and perhaps others in the family) enable her to do it. \n\nTell sis there are new household rules that are non-negotiable if she wants to continue to live in YOUR home.\n\n1. Sis need to find a job by xx date.\n2. Sis needs to contribute to the household\n3. There will be rules Sis has to abide by, one is she must parent her child.\n4. There will be rules and chores for Lauren that you will both sit down and agree on.\n5. There will be consequences for breaking the rules or having tantrums. \n\nIf sister refuses then tell her she is welcome to move out.  If you think she will be out on the street then tell her Lauren can stay with you until she gets stable housing and she can leave. \n\nI know this is harsh - but if you don't establish boundaries and stick to them, then she will just continue to use and abuse you.  It is hard and it is exhausting to hold firm, but every time you are 'just too tired' to argue she wins.  She is 'too tired' to argue or stand up to her daughter - it's easier to just give in, in her mind - so that creates a monster child. Because she (Lauren) doesn't know any better. All she knows is that if she throws a tantrum she gets what she wants. Same principle applies to your sister. \n\nIf you don't do anything about it, be prepared to live with this until she finds a new man....which she is probably looking harder for than a job.  The man will probably be temporary then she will show up on your door with Lauren AND a baby.   \n\nThink about it, you've put up with this and lived like this for TWO YEARS - how long do you want to continue to live like this and support them, getting no respect and dealing with an entitled sister &  monster-child?", "NTA\n\nGet rid of them both. If she wont dicipline the child, respect you and your home, and be an actual parent, tell he to bugger off. Not your monkeys, not your circus.", "YTA. You are an enabler.", "OP, it\u2019s time for a firm ultimatum talk with your sister. Either she starts actually parenting and disciplining and teaching her child, or she moves out. She\u2019s lazy and spoiled- she\u2019s living off of you for free so why shouldn\u2019t her child? \n\nYou\u2019re enabling this, sorry to say. \n\nNTA for disciplining the bratty child. Y T A to yourself for allowing this to continue for this long. Let the threat of homelessness motivate your sister to actually do something with her life and child.\n\nBy the way, who is paying for her phone bill? If it\u2019s you, stop immediately.", "First, I applaud you for even attempting to help \"Lauren\". Unfortunately, it's on your sis - if she doesn't improve, Lauren never will. Breaks my heart, but the issue is with your sis. By correcting Lauren, you are trying to solve a \"downstream problem\" upstream. However, if they are living with you, YOU set the rules. Doesn't matter if it's been 2 days or 2 years- she who pays the bills sets the rules. Also don't forget sis and Lauren are different entities-just cuz sis has to go, doesn't mean Lauren does. You will have 30-60 days to work stuff out if sis gets tossed and you look after Lauren. After that, sh*t will get uncomfortable with authorities. Seems to me like you have to make a choice-wash your hands of the whole thing or step the f*ck up. With kids, there are no half measures.", "Sister is doing the child no favors in life by letting her behave that way", " There are plenty of social programs available if she doesn\u2019t want to get off her ass.", "I don't know what it is like in other countries but here in the United States can't do that.\n\nShe is getting mail in the house which means will have to go through the legal route. Get eviction papers and have a sheriff come down and deliver it. You don't do that well guess what, you kick them out without going through the eviction process. Get taken to court and you lose.", "Look at her parenting.  Are you really unsure?", "If they end up homeless, get CPS involved. Your poor, horribly-behaved niece is in desperate need of boundaries and structure.", "100% that her sister would refuse to leave and will have to be forcibly evicted. OP also needs to figure out why she is letting her sister get away with using her and letting her freeload. Being family is no excuse for letting people abuse you", "No, children throw tantrums at around two or three, sometimes as late as four. They do so because they have insufficient vocabulary to explain what they want to say and think no one understands them. If a seven year old does this they are suffering with a mental illness or a learning disability."]}
