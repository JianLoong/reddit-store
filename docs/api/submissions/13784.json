We have no kids, a dog, house and both have busy jobs. When we met everything was great. She was smart, beautiful, nice, funny and we had a pretty normal sex life. Nothing crazy but I was ok with that.\n\nA few weeks before we get married she develops a condition that makes it painful to have sex. All she said was basically \u201csomething isn\u2019t right right now\u201d but no indication we\u2019d never have penetrative sex again. It\u2019s a medical issue with treatments.. I love her so we get married. I tried to be supportive and ffound treatments, tried to be supportive. She gave up immediately saying it was too uncomfortable. After bringing it up a handful of times, I realized it was going to change. She said I was putting pressure on her making things worse. I told her I felt bad and backed off on it forever.\n\nNow we have do still have non pen sex. if I don\u2019t bring up sex she\u2019d happily go years without noticing or trying to initiate. We went several months a few time. We\u2019d just end up rubbing against each other but it felt like she did not want to be there. That\u2019s not ok fore, felt very off putting and made me more distant. \n\nShe too got more and more distant. I am into feet for example. I asked over the years for her to paint them black or white. She used to get them when we\u2019re dating but once I asked it never happened again. She says those colors are for porn stars lol. I tried to explain why I thought it was weird to intentionally avoid doing something so harmless your SO likes and saying it\u2019s important for work seems like an excuse. She said I\u2019m being selfish. \n\nAny conversation in any of these topics gets immediately hostile. Now every time I bring up anything i feel scared of her reactions. She always misinterprets what I\u2019m saying and makes it very negative. Starts gets very mad when I won\u2019t admit I said what she thinks I said.\n\nI like to go out, have drinks and eat delicious food and try to enjoy life. She doesn\u2019t want to anymore .. when she does it\u2019s a rush to get home and any small talk. When she joins my daily walk she adjust complains about things like how I react when other dogs are around or how long I let my dog smell grass. \n\nNow I think- what are we gunna do when we retire? Am I just gunna always feel alone? Not fun and starting to think I life is too short .\n\nHer argument is that it lazy, don\u2019t do anything for her, etc. she said her love language is acts of service. For months I\u2019d constantly have flowers at the hoodie, cards and try to come up with fun date ideas. She then said it was a waste of time, money or whatever. \n\nI cook, take care of the dog, do laundry, work, and we split chores around the house that we do every weekend. I told her we could rebalance those but she thinks it\u2019s fair. We also hire a maid for deep cleans. She says I\u2019m distant but after years of being pushed away it\u2019s hard not to be. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I stayed too long and I\u2019m dumb or it\u2019s me?", "created_utc": 1680414049, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/129bhsu/aita_in_our_relationship/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This sounds more like a couple's counseling situation.", "NTA, but the two of you desperately need couples counseling. And possibly divorce. You should not have to spend your life walking on eggshells in a sexless marriage.", "NTA, but it honestly sounds like that marriage might not be working out. Sorry to hear about your woes man.", "NTA. You need marriage counseling and she needs to see the doctor again. New treatments come up all the time. If nothing helps and you\u2019re okay with how things are, then you still need to work on your other issues so you stay close.", "NTA. I don't know if anyone is, but she seems to not be interested at all I'm not really sure why she wanted to get married if she doesn't want to do anything at all not just sex but anything really. It's odd to have such a major switch once the marriage happened. Seems like you may not be compatible anymore and you two need to have a major conversation or seek therapy to see if anything can be worked on and if she's resistant on those then divorce may be what needs to happen. It isn't fair that you feel so isolated and alone from your own wife when the things you want to engage with her on are all reasonable asks nothing odd just basic couples activities and she seems to want nothing to do with you and then call you distant when she seems to be intentionally pushing you away. I wish you good luck with whatever happens, but you don't deserve to suffer and feel alone forever.", "NTA. Seems to be a lack of understanding and communication between you two which is causing resentment to build up for the both of you. I\u2019d suggest counseling. You feel unwanted but on the other hand, she might feel unwanted herself. I\u2019d speak to someone before this goes on for too long.", "NTA... But I'd try couples counseling as ND if that doesn't work it sounds like your marriage is likely at an end.", "NTA based on what you described honestly it feels like she is asexual but can\u2019t come clean to you. I will try to approach her calmly and let her know that she can trust you. Besides this your marriage needs serious counseling", "If neither of you are happy, there is no reason to continue torturing yourselves. You have tried to make compromises and now you are making sacrifices and she is still not happy. Life evolves and some people grow together while others grow apart and that is ok. You are definitely, from what you have explained, NTA", "NTA. Only reason I\u2019m saying that and not N A H is because based on the above the wife hasn\u2019t had an open and honest conversation around what\u2019s going on with her and how she\u2019s feeling. Get couples counselling stat, and if that doesn\u2019t work, a divorce. Life is too short", "NTA \n\nI am so sorry for you, but you're not married. You have a roommate.\n\nI don't know if she really is ill or just doesn't want you in any way.\n\nYou got married thinking that the intimacy will come back.\n\n7 years later you are in a worse situation. You don't have any kind of intimacy, every attempt of yours is met by her resistance.\n\nWhen i was young i thought that what happens in the bedroom doesn't have to be fun, enjoyable.  I married my first boyfriend and i thought that it's normal. That it's my fault if he doesn't do what other couples do. That he doesn't have to contribute to our marriage with money and any kind of chores. I had a roommate with benefits only for him. It wasn't. There were many wrong things and only after my baby was born i had the courage to break up. The divorce lasted more than my first marriage.\n\nI don't know for sure why she does these things. \n\nBut it seems that she never intended to have a relationship in the way you wanted and she's been lying to you. She thought in time you will be convinced to accept and you were. \n\nYou need to talk to your wife and tell her you are unhappy. And as much as it might hurt you, i think you should divorce.\n\nWhen you said you don't have kids i thought that maybe you don't want to or it's too soon. But you don't have because there's no way to have your own kids whithout having intimacy.\n\nIt's a painful situation because you did everything you could have done. And i think that if you tell her about the divorce she will try and convince you she can change. No matter what trauma makes her hate the intimacy (not just in the bedroom, but even holding hands, doing something that doesn't involve that h*le, she refused everything) you have no fault. And she cannot say she's traumatised by something because she had 7 years to say this. Saying it now makes anyone think it's a lie to keep you in this marriage.\n\nIt's a loveless marriage. It's not what you 2 talked about having, it's not what you signed for.\n\nYou are alone in your marriage. I am so sorry for you.\n\nIf i were you, i would first talk to a lawyer, not to her. You already spent 7 years trying to talk to her and she dismissed you.\n\nIt's time to go your separate ways. ETA to replace 1 letter", "NTA! I am a female who has struggled with pelvic pain causing painful sex. I am very lucky to have a supportive partner who never pressured me but was down to try anything and work though it. It sounds like OP is the same type of partner. Pelvic pain and sexual dysfunction is a complex issue, but I do not like how she just completely shut down OP's gentle suggestions. This is a problem that my partner and I approached together. I did not refuse to communicate or have conversations with my partner about a problem that affected both of our lives. I worked with a pelvic floor physical therapist who helped me isolate what was going on and what was triggering my pain. My partner was amazingly patient and we developed a long foreplay ritual of massages and cannabis infused lube to help relax my muscles. He does not get upset if I am in too much pain and I do not shame him for masturbating when we aren't having as much sex. It does not sound like she is interested at all in having a sexual relationship again. If she is asexual or sex really is too painful and nothing helps, then having a realistic conversation about what that means for the relationship is in order. She wont even paint her toe nails for op! Of course poor OP is distant after years of a dead bedroom and trying everything to please a selfish partner that shows no appreciation.", "rule 9 but NTA", "NTA i don't think this is sub you should ask really.  \n\nIt sounds like she is either being selfish and rude person or she is having some problems that aquire professional help. I don't think that it's healthy for you to stay in such relationship. All you do is silently suffering and it will make you explode one day. \n\nYou need to tell her that this isn't for you and that she needs to start changing if she wants to keep you. Start couple therapy and she definitely needs to start fixing her medical problem and if it's not possible perhaps make some changes in that department where you will be more satisfied.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
