It was more like store credit.  You can use it for this but only this ya know? Neither elected to use it for it's intended purpose so it went back to OP.", "That makes sense. I probably still would have kept quiet about the details and just said that I had enough to retire.", "So they're done with school, you paid for it as you said you would, but you're now supposed to keep working and not retire so you can instead fund their lifestyles with the money you saved?

Second, a person can be responsible *and* not have their shit together. They're not mutually exclusive. Third, what if they're not interested in buying a home? Fourth, of your kids grow up and are unable to get their shit together, that indicates more about their parents than about the kids themselves. \n\nDon't get me wrong, any money saved by a parent for education expenses of the child is fucking awesome. My issue is placing qualifiers on what happens to the balance once education is covered.\n\nIf your plan is to use any additional money for your retirement, great. But don't qualify what your kid may or may not get in the future based on things that are unknowable. You can set up someone for success and still watch them fail time and again if you haven't shown them how to succeed.", "HUGE.", "This isn't about honesty.  Honesty doesn't enter into it.  It's about oversharing.  It's about telling people the OP's business unnecessarily.   The kids got their education money.  What happens to the rest is mom and dad's business.\n\nI got a huge raise and bonus this year.

Oh, and I could really use a vacation.\"\n\nYeah, no.  I don't tell people jack shit about my business.", "What could he be hoping to gain by telling them he saved money for them but is now spending it?

He gave me a SWITCH for my birthday and surprises me with games. He's going back overseas early 2024 so he's really spoiling me while he's here.", "So I would chalk this up largely to everyone having their own ideas on what could happen with the college savings.\n\nI suspect your kids are feeling like they're being punished (rightly or wrongly) for selecting more cost-effective education and that those funds could have been used at times in their life when perhaps they weren't so well off or setting up businesses. They may have even thought that if they wanted to return to further their education (as you said your daughter dropped out) that the funds would still be there if need be or that you set those funds aside to further compound for your future grandchildren. \n\nBut if the intention was always to reabsorb any leftover savings and you and your spouse were the ones to fully fund the fund, then the surplus was yours to decide how to use. \n\nThis sounds largely like a miscommunication and I don't think you were the AH here, NTA.", "It really depends. \n\nI know a lot of people who were given the surplus of their college funds as wedding presents or as investments for their first homes. It's not totally wild that the kids may have thought that OP had it set aside for an intent toward them. \n\n*But* that's why one should never assume, it makes you look like an ass.", "So, that's a long interval, but you said 'no one has asked for a couple of years now' - that means that it's been discussed more recently than 13-15 years ago. What exactly did they ask? Does that mean that sometimes they have considered going in for further training and checked in with you about the money? What did you say, when they asked?", "Seems like you over prepared. But I get how they feel its like being offered a gift and then being told what they didn't use in X time is taken back.\n\nPersonally,  I'd say give them a gift of a few thousand and put the rest into your retirement. \n\nNTA", "You will enjoy it.

What a weird, selfish thing to say.", "At this point they are just being greedy. NTA", "Nobody said anything about bailing someone out.

And yes, I agree that the parent does whatever they want with the money, but it has damaged the relationship with his kids.", "I see your point, but it doesn't mean his kids will be happy. You always need an emergency fund.", "Maybe OP could\u2019ve said they got a letter from a bank account they\u2019d forgotten about or something, and it had been sitting earning interest for so long that it was sizeable", "And even if you set them up right, bad things can still happen. Sometimes people just get dealt bad cards.", "I'm leaning NAH, you said you told them but maybe it wasn't crystal clear to your kids, so it was miscommunication", "It was my daughter who thought about going back to school, and she asked if it still exists", "Why? The 'gift' was going to college without debt. They did.  OP just had a bigger budget than what was needed. \n\nIf his kids tune down a bit and act like adults, he can start off his retirement with a family cruise or something.  \n\nI would have been delighted, if my father had an extra fund for retirement.

Why did you omit this bit of information? This changes your daughter from being greedy to you being greedy.", "It's one of those things where since it's unsaid, everyone formed their own belief. It's OPs money at the end of the day, but they might have felt that option to use it for further education was still open to them.", "I agree, if it's going to be an issue, let's get the issue out of the way now while it's still young. \n\nI don't think you did anything wrong, the kids chose their futures and you supported them through that. You budgeted more than expected for them, but they surprised you by doing it cheaper.\n\nEdit: the money was never theirs, the support of school was and you upheld that responsibility amazingly well!
