I will say however, for all of the people calling kids entitled for thinking it\u2019s their money to have and use, I mean, you can\u2019t *really* blame some of them because for some, the existence of the money is probably talked about (I\u2019m not saying in your case OP, because we don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve told your kids about this money in particular, prior to this incident and prior to them going to college) and it\u2019s probably framed as \u201cThis is money that was saved for *you*, and for your college education. You can use this money how you like when the time comes.\u201d Maybe some parents do say this, but I\u2019m guessing that most who save up money for their kids don\u2019t explicitly tell them right then \u201cIf you don\u2019t go to college or if you do not finish your college education, you forfeit the money.\u201d It\u2019s probably framed in a way that leads them to believe that that money was supposed to belong to them no matter what. As for the entitlement part of it, they probably learn it from their parents and family or friends. If kids don\u2019t have parents or trusted adults to properly teach them how not to be entitled when the parents themselves act completely entitled, then they aren\u2019t ever going to understand. I just think that we can\u2019t call *all* kids entitled when we don\u2019t know how things have been said to them, and in what way those words have been framed.

Of course, that\u2019s if they were doing something else productive like working or if they had found a new passion. I might save it for a wedding fund instead or a house payment for when they are looking to buy their first home. The only reason I would take one away was if they started to spend the money in a truly frivolous way that caused them to lose that much money in a small amount of time, if they ended up on drugs, (I would most likely spend the money on a rehab in that case), or if they sat around all day doing nothing, (for reasons not related to mental health struggles or physical health struggles).", "YTA, the accounts most likely are 529 accounts which are technically considered a trust where the child is the beneficiary.

She even felt my mom and aunt should not count that as a split. \n\nMy dad and I were not shocked , she\u2019s always been a con artist. And immediately called it when she asked to move her in. My mom is still heartbroken bc my aunt cut her off for \u201cnot supporting her \u201c\n\n\nShit was wild", "That is so lovely! I\u2019m glad you were able to do that for them :)", "Oh I totally agree with this! I'm not a parent myself so I'm in no way stating I have all of the answers by the way. However i actually think (and parents agree) they enabled him somewhat by going too easy on him. He probably needed more severe discipline, but they wouldn't have him go without (as in where he'd wreck a house, my parents would clean it out and pay damages and then pay a new deposit for him bc they didn't want him in the streets--maybe it's what he needed). I couldn't imagine how difficult it would be as a parent to your child in that situation and struggling either though so I understand why they did it. And a part of me does think he wouldn't have taken well to their 'abandonment' he'd probably see it as or their stricter discipline but it's hard to know!\n\nI'm so happy you got what you needed from your family. You should be so proud of yourself too well done you!", "If anything I should be the one that feels they favoured him not me to be honest, because he needed extra attention. I can honestly say my parents are the most empathetic people, but he never had any empathy, he enjoyed watching others hurt and liked to see people fail, wouldn't be happy for anyone to succeed. He used to laugh when people got hurt in cartoons where as I'd cry, that made him laugh more. \n\nWe are not the most extreme example to be using here absolutely not, but what about serial killers? Are their parents always to blame? Ted bundy, Jeffery dahmer both report having good childhoods. It's just my opinion that some people have a stronger moral compass built within them, and some people can do bad easier than others. It's something to do with how the brain is wired I think. It's the whole nature v nurture argument isn't it. I find it interesting. But growing up is a part of taking responsibility and not blaming parents. Honestly with the things he put me through, (diagnosed ptsd as a result) I easily could have said f it and took the easy option out but instead I 'got my shit together' as phrased above. That's on me, not my parents. It works two ways the good and bad, take responsibility for yourself and noone else is responsible for the good you do either.", "Oh no no I meant your comment + my comment will make a great AITA post. \n\nSuch posts are pretty common here.\n\nOne person comes into new money, rest of the family rise from their graves to ask for their share and when denied, send flying monkeys to harass them. And then the victim coming in this sub to ask whether they're the asshole for denying them.", "(imo)It's an emotional response, in this hypothetical, they'd be feeling like they are getting punished for doing the right thing.\nIs expect they'd have the same reaction even if it was a very low amount of money that they didn't get.", "I would send them this thread to give them a reality check", "Fuck that. If my parents saved up money to send me on a vacation of my choice and I chose to go somewhere that cost less than they had saved I wouldn\u2019t feel entitled to the rest. OP saved HIS money for their education, they used as much as they needed, the rest is his.", "I have never seen Will be so stuffed before.", "Good thing I ain't Will...", "Absolutely. And I would guess that most parents who were responsible enough to save money for their kids\u2019 education/weddings/home purchases etc are also responsible enough to live within their means and don\u2019t have lavish tastes. I know damn well that even if my parents do splurge on themselves a bit and take some well deserved vacations, I won\u2019t be able to convince them not to still save a chunk for their kids and grandkids. I also know that he feels gratified in knowing he was able to do that for us after coming from nothing himself. \n\nDamn, I\u2019m gonna give that man a huge hug next time I visit.", "Ding, ding, ding! Except my dad and mom are the immigrants. And yes, they grew up very poor and struggled a lot in the early days when they came to the US with nothing (not even able to speak English). They also used to send home money to help the family they left behind in the old country. It is amazing what they were able to accomplish through hard work and smart choices - three kids through college and post grad, successful business, etc. They have earned the right to enjoy what they built. I\u2019m gonna give my dad a hug next time I see him too! :)", "What's odd is people coming at me like I voted Y T A \ud83e\udd14\n\nPretty sure it says NTA on my post.", "Much better to tell them it's none of their business.  That's not a lie.", "It's only a lie by omission if they're entitled to the information in the first place.  Adult children aren't entitled to the details of their parent's finances, and the parent isn't lying if they choose not to share them.", "I love this. We are both very lucky :)"]}
