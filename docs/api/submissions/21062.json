There\u2019s nothing selfish or judgmental about that. You\u2019re just stating a fact. Did you have to say it like that? Probably not, but it is the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. She didn\u2019t charge her EarPods even after you reminded her and now she\u2019s expecting you to fix her mistake for her by lending her your expensive headphones that you don\u2019t even take to the gym.

She's got to be responsible for her own AirPods.", "Agree", "NTA \u2014 she is the one who forgot to charge her AirPods and therefore has no right to use your expensive headphones just because she wasn\u2019t caring enough to charge her own.", "she can\u2019t take care of her stuff even when you remind her? and she thinks it\u2019s up to you to fix that? nta. what is up with her.", "NTA\n\nINFO: Was the case dead too? \n\nCause unless she needed them in her ears then and there, she could put them in the case, drive to gym, then by the time she is ready to start workout, they should have a decent amount of charge. \n\nEither way, she can face the consequences of her actions.", "Unless she\u2019s your daughter and she\u2019s 11 years old, you\u2019re not responsible for her. If you let her use your stuff, then she doesn\u2019t have to charge her AirPods or whatever because she can \u201calways\u201d use yours.\n\nNTA\n\nAnd what if your $500 headphones (or your AirPods, for that matter) got broke or damaged or lost while she was using them?  Do you think she\u2019d pay for them/replace them?  I highly doubt it.\n\nNope. If she doesn\u2019t charge her AirPods, she won\u2019t have AirPods to use. She\u2019ll get used to charging them - or she\u2019ll have to get used to NOT having them to use.\n\nDon\u2019t charge her AirPods. That\u2019s her responsibility. She needs to take her of her own stuff.", "NTA", "NTA she\u2019s the AH. exploiting your preparedness so she doesn\u2019t have to experience the consequences of her own carelessness, leaving you without your headphones you remembered to charge, is fucked up. my ex husband used to do this with all kinds of things but what sticks out in memory rn is he was always stealing my clean socks (bc he needed to do his laundry) or using my electric toothbrush, for the same reason - mine was charged. \n\ni\u2019m just saying, he was selfish af in many other respects.", "NTA no one should ever share AirPods they go in your dirty ear.", "Yeah, there are a lot of cheap choices out there, and if she can't be bothered to charge her headphones, that's what she gets.\n\nAlthough it kinda sucks that OP, who has two pairs of headphones already, has to get extra headphones for his slacker girlfriend.", "She could have purchased cheap secondary ear buds for $20. Nope, she needs your stuff.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re both adults, and I\u2019m not your mom.\u201d", "Suggest she grow up and plan for her needs......you'll be doing her a favor in the long run", "NTA, she needs to grow up and take care of her own belongings. You reminded her to charge hers and she blew you off.  Now she gets to workout without music.  When you get chance stop at the dollar store and pick up a cheap set of earphones and hand them to her next time hers die.", "NTA.\n\nShe's escalating, though.\n\nDunno if this is critical enough, but if she escalates, don't let it slide.", "NTA. She is an adult and needs to learn to take care of the things she likes to use. I wouldn't have loaned her the earphones.", "Could you not have worked out together and worn one pod each? It\u2019s what my bf and I do when we go to the gym together", "NTA, and I wouldn't have loaned her my other headphones either. Her reward for failing to adult is that she gets to listen to bad gym music over the speakers for an hour.", "NTA\n\nAirPods will charge a decent amount in literally five minutes. She needs to be responsible for her own electronics. \n\nThere\u2019s no way nice over the head headphones should be used to work out in.", "There are some good ones on Amazon that cost about $20.  I have a teen who doesn't lose them but tends to break all her headphones/earbuds somehow, so she only gets the inexpensive kind. (Other than her Krakens with the light up ears that aren't allowed to leave the house.) Unless OP's girlfriend is an audiophile or someone who is really bothered about appearing in cheap earbuds, I suggest he looks at some of them. TOZO is a good brand, and there are others that are close dupes to Air Pods, if you don't look for the logo. No idea on the sound quality of those though.", "NTA, this pigeon says failure to prepare on her part does not constitute and emergency on your part.", "NTA its her fault there not charged and cant she use wired pair you get with the phone?", "NTA.  I have AirPods and a set of super nice headphones. I don\u2019t let anyone touch the headphones. I keep both charged and there\u2019s literally nothing else I pay that much attention to when it comes to charging. She needs to put on her big girl panties and realize she\u2019s only doing it to herself.", "NTA. Sharing in-ear pods of any type is just gross.", "NTA\n\nSounds like she needs more than one set of earbuds.  Nope, I would not have loaned mine, either"]}
