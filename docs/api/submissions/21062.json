There\u2019s nothing selfish or judgmental about that. You\u2019re just stating a fact. Did you have to say it like that? Probably not, but it is the truth and sometimes the truth hurts. She didn\u2019t charge her EarPods even after you reminded her and now she\u2019s expecting you to fix her mistake for her by lending her your expensive headphones that you don\u2019t even take to the gym. You\u2019re right that\u2019s not your responsibility. If anyone is being selfish here it is her.
