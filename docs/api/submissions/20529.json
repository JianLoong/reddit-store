I hope his friends laughed in his face.", "NTA \n\nit's nice that you both want to gift her something. i get the feeling your friend is jealous that you had such a great idea.", "NTA.\nYour gift is very beautiful and thoughtful, he's feeling bad or jealous that you had a better idea, that's understandable, because I also was jealous of my friends, my gifts weren't that good or expensive, and I felt inferior or that im a bad friend, but never confronted others for their gifts just cause theirs over shadowing mine. That's on me. So don't feel bad, you didn't do anything bad.", "NTA - he's just being all jealous about your generosity, which seems to dwarf his effort.", "NTA. Yikes. It sounds like he was trying to hit on her and is pissed off your gift will get you the attention he seeks. Just watch out for her.", "ESH - So are you both in love with this girl?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Honestly it sounds like R wants to be better than you by taking your gift and giving it to her along with his as if he came up with the whole idea. You are entitled to give her whatever gift your mind can think of and this seems like R is jealous. You are not in the wrong whatsoever.", "NTA. \n\nSounds like R cares more about the praise from G, as a result of his gift, rather than G\u2019s actual happiness from receiving a multitude of gifts. However, I can understand his perspective and how it may feel a bit undermining. But, at the end of the day gift giving isn\u2019t a competition.", "Is this the kind of post that happens when an alien passing as a human tries showcasing what they\u2019ve learned about human conflict?", "I'm not sure if he is, but I'm not", "Lmao I thought this too", "You bought her a ring my guy.", "She doesn't like bracelets or necklaces, she has a collection of rings, I'm happy accepting the judgement of course, but a rings a logical gift in the situation in my opinion", "I'm a girl and I buy my girls rings allll the time.

His gift is very thoughtful but not outlandish.\n\nYou don't have to be in love with someone to know their interests and want to give them something special.\n\nu/Weiss_Fan, you are NTA in any way.\n\nYour \"friends\" faux outrage is making him look like a fool.  No one else would even know about it if he wasn't running around whining about it.  He's making someone else's trauma about himself.\n\nYou're an amazing friend.  Keep supporting her and pay no mind to the nonsense.", "Logical gift? Sorry, is there context for why you were buying gifts. Since from the post it just seemed like your buddy want to get a her a present out of the blue. That and the contents of said gift made it seem like her was trying to romance her. Then you came in and one upped him.", "Fair point, I guess this was more culturally accepted than my broke ass could comprehend.", "Did you even read the post?  \n\nTheir mutual friend just escaped a traumatic situation.  They are doing what friends do.\n\nI do think it's possible the other guy has feelings, as that would be the only (not) logical explanation I can possibly think of for acting this irrational.\n\nBut to make it seem like its just not possible or normal for a platonic friend to do something like this for someone they care about, then I wonder if you've ever had any real friends or cared about anyone.", "Yeah that's why I'm confused. Not really a gift giving situation. They can offer their support but the buying of gifts, seems pretty tone deaf. Um yeah I would never buy my friends jewelry for any occasion.", "I think that's just a difference in personality/culture. Some people's love language is gift giving, others want to show they are thinking of someone and give them a gift to show that and others want to gift someone something as reward for them doing something really hard and/or to show that you think they did the right thing.   \n\n\nThat ring could be really helpful at her \"weak\" moments, where she's not sure if she did the right thing or doesn't know what to do, and can serve as a reminder that she's not alone and that she has a network of people who  are there for her and who care about her.", "NTA for getting a nicer gift than him but as a woman this seems like a wildly over the top gift from a friend and would make me deeply uncomfortable.", "Soft ESH.\nYour friend is overreacting about the value of the gift, for sure. However I would strongly encourage you not to give the ring to her just yet. She has just come out of an abusive relationship, trust me you end up afraid of your own shadow for a while. What she needs right now is actions rather than words or gifts. Actually being there and listening to her, not treating her any differently. Getting a gift right now, especially one with romantic connotations, is terrifying. She'll feel trapped in a corner and like she owes you.\nI know that's not your intention, so I'd wait until she is more settled. That may be some time, but she will get there. Crowding her with presents seems a bit too close to love bombing. It's really nice that you guys care for her so much. Showing up for her and helping with her kid with her permission is a good start.", "NTA. It seems like your friend wants to fuck her. And considering he's already acting controlling about other people treating her well, and she's just out of an abusive relationship, I'd say he's acting pretty predatory.\n\nAs a woman who is also fresh out of an abusive relationship, I'd want to know about this guy's behavior so I could avoid hooking up with another controlling dick bag.", "Personally, I think R has feelings for G and thought of his gift as a first step towards that. May be well-intentioned or creepy, but either way has no bearing on your gift OP."]}
