This helps absorb a lot of the noise- tall bookcases with books\u2026 you can get both bookshelf and cheap books at thrift stores and yard sales. \nMy son\u2019s room is the worst for some reason- no clue why\u2026 we put his bed on the far wall from the noisy neighbors and placed a mattress that we covered with a cool looking fitted sheet along the divider wall. It absorbs A LOT of sound- he rarely hears the neighbors now.\nIt sounds extreme but at over $2000 a month in rent, we just can\u2019t afford anything more expensive and honestly, the location we have is PERFECT for the kids. Plus, it is pet friendly- a rare find in our area. \nOP, there are things to do to reduce the sound without moving. It isn\u2019t perfect but it helps. You can Google ways to reduce noise from neighbors in apartments.\nGood luck! Thank you for your service and I hope you find relief from neighbors soon!", "Exactly this", "Did you not read my post? It does not seem that you're commenting on the same thing. speculation of danger to the children. Not just a noise complaint", "There has been some commotion that did not seem like children being scolded. Little bit beyond that, but not anything fully observable. I have also tried to communicate to the parents and front office to know avail. I edited my post to make that clear. Reading back on my original, it was a little bit rushed  to say the least", "I would only be calling if the kids were in a notable danger.

And though they are still children and we should be treated with all the dignity and respect that entails. I'm really tired of people having a single track mindset. That's kind of why I'm in this conundrum because I don't know what to do. If you read my post I understand what Child Protective Services can do. My family was privy to it when I was young. I've exhausted all other options trying to reach out to the parents, the front office, etc.\n\nI'm sorry you did not read that I have gone through every step and exhausted all options except this one.", "Because they don't actually care about the children, they called them monsters. It's because they know calling cps will stir up the families life worse than just talking to the apartment managers.", "And that's the thing, I don't want anybody evicted and I don't want anybody have to deal with any agencies. I would only call CPS if there's direct danger to the kids. Having tried to talk to the front office and the parents to no avail has been frustrating. Though it just seems like I might have to grin and be miserable", "This would not be a direct delete. I've tried to talk to the parents, put in complaints with the apartment, there's no other option than this. And unless there's actual sign of abuse I'm not going to. Right now it's speculative that there is.", "I would call them if there is reason to believe there being abused. This is a serious question. Is that not clear in my post?", "I have and they have done nothing. Seems there's no solution for me. CPS would only be for if they're in danger, can't prove that and I'm not going to go out of my way to try. Not my business", "I've already tried to communicate with them and the front office. I will only be calling CPS if there's direct evidence of the kids in danger as well. I have multiple times try to communicate outwardly. It goes on deaf ears", "There is some speculation and some observation of situations that did seem a bit out of the norm of child noises and rowdiness. But only speculation and nothing fully observed. To answer you in short yes there is some worry. Though no evidence. I've tried to communicate with the front office and the parents to know avail. And would only call the CPS or any other agency Etc if I had Direct knowledge of an incident or immediate danger. I read back through my first post and realized I was a little bit quick on the fingers and not as detailed as I should have been. Nerves were a little bit wrecked when I was typing. Had made an edit trying to clear some things up.", "I hear screaming and crying. And adult yelling. Not shut up yelling but kind of aggressive. Mind you former Soldier so my version of aggressive is a little bit upscale comparatively. The landlords have done nothing. CPS is the last option other than calling the cops which would result in the first. I don't want to do either because I don't want law enforcement around anybody unless absolutely necessary. This is hardly necessary for that. It seems I will be waiting to see if there is actual abuse. If not I'll just let myself go insane and off myself. Seems to be what everybody wants here", "Thank you, and that's kind of where I'm at. I don't want to call them and I don't think that's the option I'm going to choose. I'm very stressed and don't have any options. I just moved here 3 months ago and don't have an option to move because there's nowhere I can afford. I guess just life sucks until I die. At this rate and with the type of responses I've gotten here I might just have that be soon.", "I appreciate the response. Did not know anything about the Ada accommodations. Though I do see some things listed that I might be able to approach. I want to be clear that I would only call CPS if it is danger to the kids and it was clearly observable. I've spoken to the landlord and tried to attempt to speak to the parents. When I figured is I would have to grin and bear it until I go crazy and then sit here being miserable going crazy.", "Why the fuck would I have to move. Two to insinuate that it's just easy to up and go is laughable and unrealistic. The housing market is extremely tough. And I am a disabled veteran with very little income. I don't have many choices. It's also not my problem that the children cannot adhere to the quiet hours stated on every lease here. Although seemingly not enforced by the front office.\n\nAs I said in my post this isn't something I want to do or I'm going to do just yet.", "First thing I did try to talk to the front office multiple times and the parents multiple times. That's clearly stated. If not I edited and made it so it is clearly stated twice. Yes I can only go off of the Assumption because I'm going off of sound currently. Call in CPS will only be the option I take if something dangerous is occurring", "As stated in my original post they won't. Nor will talk into the parents. Both are dead ends. Also will not be calling it unless there is danger to the kids.", "My post clearly states that I've tried to speak to the parents and the front office which or the landlords. I also stated I would only call CPS if there are danger to the children.", "Two things here. Firstly, in my original post I thought I had made it clear that I would only call if there was a dangerous situation. That has been rectified. Secondly, on another front. Do you not realize how unrealistic it is to just break a lease and try to find somewhere else to move? Especially when you're only income is disability? There are no programs or aid for disabled veterans.", "I edited my post. I would only call if there was danger to the kids. And there has been a few instances where that is not fully observable but very easy to speculate.", "Landlord won't do a damn thing unfortunately. Though I think I'll take your advice and see where that goes", "No, and that's not what my post says. I would call them if there's clear and present danger to the children.", "There's been a few times that there's no commotion that was not rowdiness of children. Very speculation there could be danger. Though nothing observable. I would only make that call if there was. I have tried to speak to the building manager and parents to know avail. Since my only solution is to sit here and be miserable", "I would only be calling if the kids were in a notable danger. I've already tried to communicate to the office and the parents. Seems I'm just going to sit here and be miserable", "If people call CPS every time a child screamed or cried, every child would be under CPS supervision. He is not concerned about the children. He is trying to find an excuse to report them because they are disturbing him. He should make a noise complaint to his landlord, not burden an already overtaxed system and divert resources from abused and neglected children who truly need the help!", "Screaming and crying isn't abuse. It's life. If a person calls cps without actual evidence, they are the AH in every instance. And if they have evidence and haven't called, then they're also the AH. Being on Reddit asking this question is proof that one way or another, OP is the AH.", "Appreciate the feedback. I would not be calling unless absolutely certain that they're in danger", "I edited my post a little bit. To reflect that I am not going to call CPS unless I see or have evidence of direct conflict or danger. I don't think the cops would be wise. Where I live if the cops get called and there are children and CPS are automatically brought. So that's not very an option. To add to it I don't think bringing police into this environment is good for anybody.\n\nSeems I'm going to have to grin and bear it until this lease is up.", "That's kind of where I'm at. I'm not going to call just to make a noise complaint. I appreciate that you didn't tell me to try to just up and move as if that's something that's realistic and my situation.\n\nThough, seems like I don't have any options but to sit here and suffer. Having tried to communicate with both the front office and the parents multiple times. Not much else I can do but sit here", "And who's going to help me pay for that? In what world is that a realistic option? I'm barely able to afford food as it is. I've hardly eaten more than bread and pasta for months", "I'm not going to call CPS unless there is danger to the kids. I made that pretty clear. Though implicating that moving is realistic is one of the most laughable things I've been reading on this comment chain. Are you going to pay to break my lease? Are you going to pay for moving resources? What about application fees, first month's rent, and everything else that entails. Not coming at you. Just a little bit irritating having read this a few times by now. There is no realism or ability for that statement as life sits. Seems my only option is to sit here miserable. And if that's what it is that's what it'll be until I'm not anymore. Thanks for the engagement.", "This was the direction I was kind of going. I had to edit my post does not seem I made my actual intentions clear nor the scenario clear as well. I will only call CPS if there's danger to the kids and it's clearly observable. I have reached out to the landlord and tried with the parents. I'll take the above route and sit here miserable", "I completely agree", "The VA is a nightmare to deal with at best. \n\nHave you tried looking for a VA social worker and/or VA advocate to help you navigate through all of this?\n\nThey can usually \u201cget the ball rolling faster\u201d and help take some of the load off for you. \n\nThey also might be able to assist with helping you find more appropriate housing.", "VA thing sucks- been there with the provider switcharoo. Depending on where you are, (the VA I go to is mostly great) all VA have a a supportive housing program. This department he,ps veterans with housing.

You KNOW that. You also know good and well that if you had any actual cause for concern then you'd be listing it all off here, but you aren't because you don't have it. CPS isn't going to make parents make children be quiet, and you damn well know that too.\n\nlooks like you've narrowed down your options to moving or sucking it up.", "I know it\u2019s petty but have you tried doing the same back? I would hit at there wall for long periods until they stop. Sometimes people are selfish and don\u2019t care about an issue until it happens to them. I would also try sleeping with noise canceling headphones maybe it could help?", "Yes. What's clear is you're grasping at straws. You have no evidence other than the kids are loud and it's disturbing you.", "You literally don't have hard evidence. Just file a noise complaint and keep an ear out.", "Yea ok that\u2019s exactly what I said. Save the dramatics", "Honey, nobody here cares enough about you to care if you go insane and off yourself or not, probably no one will be thinking about this longer than an hour from now.  but nice job bringingout the martyrdom when nobody went for it.", "Too say that there is no programs or aid to help veterans is false. You have resources, you just need to do your research.

As far as you know, they are experiencing something similar and doing the best they can right now.", "I mean, that\u2019s really the only realistic suggestion to make if you have such an issue with the noise. I\u2019m sure there would be some kind of support you could access or other suitable housing in the same price range.", "I am glad you responded  there are resources if you dial 211, they might be able to help in the mean time,  noise canceling  head phones,   spend time at vetrans club,  hoping for the  best", "Absolutely. Right now the current local VA is going through a lot of changes and there's a very Mass shortage of every type of doctor and worker. I'm on waiting list for a few different things. Working with a few external programs as well. Though with a lot of people out of work and a lot of people in situations like my previous one. There's not many options that are viable at this moment other than sitting here and dealing with it. Which is what I'll do. The reality of this situation is not much can be done until resources become available", "Well I did edit it.

I'll see you in hell", "How do you think I obtained my disability just recently? Right now the current VA in Richmond Virginia is going through not only a renovation but a restructure to include a brand new women's clinic. A lot of providers have been directly diverted to that clinic. I do not fit that demographic. Side note very happy that women are finally getting their own Clinic with a VA, it's only been a thousand years it feels like but that's a conversation for a different time.\n\nMy social worker said there is nothing available as far as re-housing. Communicating to the landlord through them does nothing. The state programs are non-existent. In fact my food stamps were cut completely. And social programs that were out there have been cut by our governor. I've exhausted every resource currently. Including but not limited to wwp, vfw, VA social services, and the state.\n\nDo you not realize how many people are out of work right now and are in need?"]}
