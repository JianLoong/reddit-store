This helps absorb a lot of the noise- tall bookcases with books\u2026 you can get both bookshelf and cheap books at thrift stores and yard sales. \nMy son\u2019s room is the worst for some reason- no clue why\u2026 we put his bed on the far wall from the noisy neighbors and placed a mattress that we covered with a cool looking fitted sheet along the divider wall. It absorbs A LOT of sound- he rarely hears the neighbors now.\nIt sounds extreme but at over $2000 a month in rent, we just can\u2019t afford anything more expensive and honestly, the location we have is PERFECT for the kids. Plus, it is pet friendly- a rare find in our area. \nOP, there are things to do to reduce the sound without moving. It isn\u2019t perfect but it helps.

I honestly think it's hard on both sides, and apartment buildings that have thin walls is the real A H in this situation. \n\nDefinitely don't call child protective services UNLESS you're fairly certain you've witnessed or heard abuse.

(This won\u2019t hold up officers from being rerouted to a life threatening emergency. Calls such as this are held if another call is a priority.)\n\u2022 An officer or two, depending on the sounds you relay to the call taker, will knock on their door. They\u2019ll ask them to knock it off and give them a warning, especially if the officer can hear it when they come up. \n\u2022You can request to have contact or not. I would suggest phone contact. This keeps you from possible retaliation, but let\u2019s them know it\u2019s serious enough that you need to speak with someone. \n\nEach time this happens, call the non emergency line.

It's also very hard to report to cps because you have to back it up  with facts,dates, etc and you cannot report anonymously. Probably to prevent people abusing cps as retribution . If it's happening all hours, the neighbors don't care, you document every instance. You have the legal right to quiet enjoyment of your home.  Apartment.leases usually require rugs to reduce sound disturbance you are describing. Your county has noise  ordinances. After a certain hour you could call police to report them . Your best option would be to talk to a real estate lawyer - your best case is with the landlord enforcing the lease and you might have legal right to withhold rental payment until he takes appropriate action to rectify the issue. There will always be more noise with children but in an apartment building one still has an obligation to be respectful of others right to quiet enjoyment. Friends once had an issue the landlord didn't handle and they won their case plus damages and lived rent free for almost 2 years on top of keeping the rent they withheld.

Truthfully I think you need to lever harder on your landlord to either move you to a quieter, top floor unit or to release you from your lease so you can get into a quieter top floor/corner unit in another building. (CPS is highly unlikely to effectively change these parents' parenting style and I can guarantee that they won't (and shouldn't) take kids out of the home just because they're being yelled at.)\n\nIf you can afford to pay a real estate attorney for an hour of time to write a letter to your landlord that's the fastest method to get action. The attorney will press them regarding your right to quiet enjoyment and can reference your medical need to avoid sudden loud noises.

I wish you luck. :)", "I think violating the noise ordinances is a good reason to call since they won't make any effort. Unless you feel it's weaponizing the police. You can make real noise complaints and one visit might be enough for the family to work to reduce noise and be considerate because they do have some obligation to be reduce noise pollution. A real estate lawyer will best guide you.", "Good deal. You are awesome for asking if YWBTA first and thinking of the kids. It might be that your situation magnifies normal noisy family chaos to seem like it is at the level of abuse though it really it might not be. It still might be out of line for apartment dwellers if it is noisy too early or too late for lease rules. And it can certainly be way way too much on your nervous system. Mine gets overloaded sometimes and it is awful. I am so sorry you are having to grapple with this. I am glad you have your benefits and I hope you can now get access to all the resources and strategies you need. Some of the new treatments sound promising. And a quieter apartment!", "u/Humafhjk is a bot and had copied a partial comment from OP from further down.\n\nFfs, report this piece of dumb technology. Thanks.", "If you have a documented disability your landlord has to help make accommodations for it. Ask if you can move to another empty apartment in the complex. Perhaps top floor.", "Quite literally. As I type this. When I posted originally at 5:00 in the morning. 2:00 in the morning, midnight, and so on. It's hard to tell what's going on. Other than kids being kids. I have no direct evidence out there in danger. That said I wouldn't be calling anybody unless I did. I don't want to call the police, they have a habit of calling CPS if there are children involved even if there's no danger. So I likely will do nothing other than the communicate to the front office again", "My last apartment was top floor and I sorely Miss it. The only top floor units are multi-bedroom. I can't afford it and don't really need the room. I've got 8 months left on the lease. Going to be a long 8 months", "Yeah that's about it. I'm not going to call any Agency on anybody without a very good reason to do so. I know my original post may have come off differently. And that's on me for bad typing on a phone. I completely agree with you, and seems you get where I'm coming from. I appreciate that", "I've stated multiple times that I would only call if there was observed danger. There's no straws and the first fucking place. If there is observed action there will be action taken. If not I do nothing. How's that hard to fucking comprehend", "Financially I don't have the ability to do anything else until my lease is up. I completely agree with what you're coming from and you seem to understand where I'm coming from as well. Unfortunately I'm just stuck unless the front office takes action.", "Dramatics? Having to go to the hospital because of the situation is not dramatic. Not being able to have any quality of life because of the situation it is not dramatic. Fuck I think you're the asshole", "Everything here is tapped because there's a lot of people out of work. And covid destroyed a lot of the resources that were here. At this juncture I am on waiting lists for a few things but they're long time out.", "Fair enough. I have a step brother who is wrapped up in xanax. He also was in the Army at the same time. I was on Xanax for a while and it was not a fun experience or a beneficial experience.", "At this rate I might try to eat the rent increase to get a two bedroom which would put me above anybody else. I just don't think I can financially afford that", "Thanks again very much appreciated.", "I hope there's a solution somewhere in the future. I'll keep searching. Appreciate the conversation", "There\u2019s a few little things you can try on your own. \n\nI would *not* suggest adding any type of medication sleep-aid unless you talk with your MD first though (a phone call to the nurse might suffice) but there\u2019s over the counter sleep-aids like melatonin and PM pain relievers to help. \n\nOther aids that wouldn\u2019t require asking anyone about could be useful to try as well; like a white noise machine, soothing lights, sleep mask, ear plugs, a warm bath before bed, meditation, a cup or warm tea or milk, picking up a new hobby, etc. \n\nI know some of these might seem to sound completely worthless to you\u2026 but really little things DO add up to help you relax enough to assist with you returning to homeostasis\u2026 and that\u2019s where you need to work on trying to get so your body won\u2019t be in hyper-stressed mode anymore. \n\nYou don\u2019t have to just sit there and suffer thru this\u2026 but, trying other alternatives to find what works best for you is only a job you can do for yourself.", "So document everything that\u2019s going on. Make a written complaint to the landlord if you haven\u2019t already. And definitely call the police non emergency number when this happens again, particularly if it\u2019s the middle of the night. If they\u2019re being excessively loud in the middle of the night then they\u2019re almost certainly violating local noise ordinances.", "[removed]", "Have you tried things like noise-cancelling headphones and properly fitted earplugs? It may not fully resolve the noise but it might help you fall asleep or stay asleep once you are...", "Due- Whatever you need to tell yourself. If you wanna think I\u2019m an AH go ahead. I\u2019m just confused as to where in my original reply I said anything about you going insane and offing yourself \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "right on dude", "I appreciate the suggestions and we'll possibly try some of them. At this rate I need to try something. I don't want to cause them any issues and I don't want to go through having to deal with any agency or group even if it's a phone call. Too much of a headache to get wrapped up in to something for all the aforementioned", "Sounds like the best plan", "sure", "I have. The help in some degree. They're all the times a lot of the banging comes with a lot of reverberation that is very felt. It's something I do try, the headphones that is. I think that's as good as it's going to get for me. We'll just have to adapt to this as best I can"]}
