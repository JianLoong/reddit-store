I am on the spectrum and generally not great with people or social situations. I am also horrible with names. I work in legal my primary role is to go over deals. I have very little interaction with the rest of the staff. My department knows my quirks and are not bothered by it. \n\nHowever, the rest of the staff does not which is understandable since I rarely have interactions with them. I have been asked to go up to the main floor to hand over my findings, during those times I try to be friendly and i would say things like \"Hey man, how are you?\" To my male colleagues, I have been told keeping greetings informal like that is a great way to be seen as more friendly. \n\nI recently said this to colleague that I forgot is Trans. I tend to go based off physical appearance and this has gotten in trouble as a kid also. Just during the work week and when I am around others my brain just cannot process what I view as unnesscary information and that often comes in the form of names, preferences, birthdays among other things. \n\nIt is not to be rude or anything it took me three years to get my GF's name right. I still forget my parents, and my GF's birthday.\n\nThat being said during the HR meeting I was reprimanded, and they asked me to apologize and not to do it again. I did apologize but I told them I cannot promise that will not make such a mistake, if they wanted to avoid said mistake in the future they would have to wear a name tag with their pronous cause I probably will not remember this conversation or your face a week from now.\n\nI was just being honest, my GF understands where I am coming from she has been with me for 4 years, but she also said she could understand why those that do not know me as well view me as an asshole. \n\nAm I the asshole for being honest? If I am the asshole any suggestion how I can make it right?", "created_utc": 1690237665, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/158p9m9/aita_for_not_remembering_s_a_colleagues_preferred/", "score": 168, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I can see how my comment hurt them, but I know my limits as a person and as i rude as it may see as I told them.

People who don't get it sometimes view your \"reasons\" as \"excuses\" - probably would have been better off apologizing and saying it was an honest mistake without the name tag comment. (That was rude...as you wouldn't want to wear a \"spectrum\" name tag, would you?)", "I have a tough time recognizing people AT ALL. \n\nBut I have to, for my job. \n\nI will no kidding make like baseball cards for my coworkers with a few facts about them and their names, and pronouns if I need to, to get it down. \n\nThis is a solvable problem. If you aren\u2019t willing to solve it, you might be TA.  This is literally one coworker with this need and you can\u2019t be assed to care, but you want people to understand your needs. It\u2019s a two-way street, honored human.", "Gentle YTA.\n\nYou are definitely trying to be a good person, which is great. You're not purposefully misgendering your colleagues, it's an accident and accidents happen.\n\nHowever, asking for a name tag with pronouns etc is a bit rude because you're basically implying that they do not pass as their preferred gender which can be really damaging for their self esteem. \n\nUsing \"I'm on the spectrum\" as an excuse doesn't really work either because either way, your language is hurting another person and I don't think being on the spectrum permits you to hurt someone, intentionally or not. \n\nMy personal advice would be to make a habit of using gender neutral terms, or to just practice being mindful of people's preferences. This doesn't always apply to trans people, a personal experience I had was with a cis-woman who hated being called a lady (She said it was too snobby and feminine and made her feel u comfortable) so I stopped calling her a lady. Sometimes words just erk people, for whatever reason, but you probably wouldn't want people upsetting you so we should all make an effort to try not to upset others.\n\nGentle YTA. It was an accident... But hopefully you have some methods to prevent it from happening again.\n\nEdit: For people calling me out on using the word \"Excuse\", I apologised in another comment, it does have negative connotations, so I do apologise. Perhaps \"Justification\" is better for lack of a better term?", "NAH.\n\nBut this is a \"you\" issue. Not saying it in a mean way. Rather I'm pointing out that you need to figure out how to navigate this in any settings that will require you to address people outside your normal circle. It's not up to the rest of the world to not be upset at you for what looks like disrespect. \n\nYou know how you learned saying :\n\n>Hey man, how are you?\n\nuntil it seems natural? I bet that took practice and patience with yourself. Do you remember the reasons behind why you put in the effort? Maybe it's so that you can navigate social situations better. Maybe it's to convey niceness to people you see everyday.\n\nYou need to do the same here. Bring index cards with your colleagues' names and pronouns if you're scheduled to see them. Maybe a mnemonic helps. Practice generic greetings that don't rely on gender. \n\nTook you 3 years to get your GF's name right? Great. It shows you can do it. While you're not mentally wired to remember names/faces/pronouns easily, you recognize that there are many, many people in your life who appreciate it.  You could have gotten away with a nickname for your girlfriend.  Instead you decided it's worth the effort to get her name right.", "NTA... Your workplace knows you're on the spectrum and they disciplined you for something that is literally a legally defined disability. They can't reprimand you for that. They can bring it to your attention, ask you to apologize and offer a solution or ask you to help come up with a solution for the problem, but you can't get in trouble for your disability.  That's illegal.  \n\nGiven that your workplace has trans and likely non-binary employees, hr should add a line to the name tags and have people declare their pronouns on them to prevent any confusion not only by fellow co-workers who may or may not interact with them regularly, those who might be nuerodivergent such as yourself and so that strangers to your company such as clients,  don't have to guess and possibly insult someone.  It's an easy fix to help everyone and insure that no one feels disrespected or insulted.  In fact it's a common practice in a lot of companies these days to prevent anyone from having to guess.  It's not your job to know all of your coworkers'names in a business where you don't or rarely interact with people outside of your dept.  \n\nYou made a simple mistake and meant no harm by it.  Apologize and if you feel comfortable, explain to that person that you didn't mean to misgender them, that you're on the spectrum and it's very hard for you to recall details about people that you aren't working closely with on a daily basis.  Do NOT mention anything about their appearance or going by what you see for identify. That will offend them even further.  Also, don't use any gendered terms with people because you could very well have non-binary people at your workplace.\n\nThen go back to hr and suggest adding pronouns to the name tags as a solution to prevent anyone from accidentally misgendering anyone.  If they don't think it's a valid idea, bring up the fact that if a person is non-binary that they could constantly be misgendered by everyone they come into contact with and that it is in the best interest of everyone so that there is no risk of anyone causing that offense by accident to any of your fellow employees, whether it be a coworker, boss, hr or a client.", "YTA but only because you won\u2019t come up with a solution, and you\u2019re also playing yourself. Everyone makes mistakes and it\u2019s totally fine to mess up names and even pronouns here and there. But using the incorrect pronouns repeatedly, depending on policy, can be seen to constitute sexual harassment or a hostile work environment. At the very least it will make this coworker uncomfortable at work and not want to be around you. You either need to stop using gendered language at work or come up with a different solution to avoid this happening in the future.", "YTA: Being on the spectrum is no excuse to be an asshole.\n\nAlso, how are you working in your company's legal department to review \"deals\" when you admit you are *not* detail oriented and can't remember things like names?", "YTA\n\nLook you know you have difficulty remembering pronouns if it's not obvious to you. That means you need to work around that by doing things like checking pronouns (e.g. in an email signature, or maintain a contact list with notes on preferred pronouns) before meeting with someone, and using gender-neutral greetings in more casual interactions.\n\nThere is no reason for you to say \"Hey man, how are you?\" rather than \"Hey, how are you?\" since this is now a known problem where you're misgendering people.", "YTA\n\nListen I get it may not come natural to use nonbinary pronouns.  To help train myself, I practiced with some of our household objects.  Our Roomba (previously he/him) was rechristened and became they/them. It's a great low-stakes way to practice and your partner can help you catch any misgendering.  Practice helps!", "Info: OP, do you have an anti social personality disorder? The way you speak about your colleagues and others shows a complete lack of empathy?", "NTA.  There is no need to use pronouns when speaking directly to a person so just avoid it completely.  Everyone needs to be a little more tolerant and understanding of your needs too.", "NTA.  I am on no one's spectrum and make mistakes.  I think intent matters.", "NTA. Honestly people who get upset when you accidentally fuck up their pronouns are insufferable. If you\u2019re not purposely misgensering someone you\u2019re not an AH. Also I feel like society forgets that humans naturally think man or woman when looking at another human whether we know their pronouns are not. Just do your best, apologize if you make a mistake and move on", "YTA. Ok, you have a problem that you recognize as a problem, and yet you don't do ANYTHING on your end to mitigate it. Make a memo for yourself not to address people in a gendered way, make a list of people with their faces, names and preferred pronouns that you put on the wall next to your workplace, make an effort! So far it seems like \"I have a problem, but I'm gonna make it YOUR problem and make you adjust to my circumstances instead of adjusting myself\".", "YTA because you could literally just stop saying \"hey man\" and instead say \"hey.\" You could do this across the board. It's an easy solution. If it doesn't come naturally, you could practice it like it sounds like you had to with the \"hey man\"-type greetings. It doesn't matter what a therapist told you years ago if the way you're greeting someone now hurts them.", "Yes, YTA\n\nYour offhand comment about needing a name tag was extra rude and dismissive.", "I was gonna say something differently but YTA based on the replies you\u2019ve been making.

Pronouns being high on the list. Why did pronouns become a similar offense to sexual harassment that you get called in by HR for it? It\u2019s ludicrous! This undermines real problems and wastes people\u2019s time. Are people so effing bored that they have to actively find things to be upset about? You know you have a comfy, soft life when you can waste time and energy on such trivial BS. \n\nI know people are going to jump up my ass for this, but F it. I\u2019m sick of it. People\u2019s personal feelings being hurt by unintentional simple mistakes are THEIR problem to deal with, not ours. Go see a therapist if you can\u2019t handle life so much that a damn pronoun gets your panties/manties in a twist. Seriously. Get mad at intent, not innocent ignorance. You can tell when someone is intentionally insulting you and when it\u2019s just a simple blunder.

So if you were seeing what was obviously a man, it would be normal for you to call him \"he\". Likewise, a blatantly obvious woman would be referred to as \"she\"\n\nBut now, this perfectly normal (and simple) system that has been in existence for millions of years, has suddenly been turned up its head and countless number of genders have been introduced whereby nobody knows what on earth to call each other anymore\n\nLet me repeat that. In the last 5 years or, these people are trying to reverse millions of years of how we've been hardwired to view gender\n\nSo if someone like the OP happens to get something wrong under these new but incredibly bizarre rules...cut him some slack. Only 5 mins ago calling a man \"him\" was perfectly fine. And now suddenly he's getting warned by his employer for it? At least give him time to wrap his head round this madness", "Soft YTA. I see that your intentions were not malicious but ignorant. You might want to consider using gender neutral pronouns and pet names in future.

I am on the spectrum and generally not great with people or social situations. I am also horrible with names. I work in legal my primary role is to go over deals. I have very little interaction with the rest of the staff. My department knows my quirks and are not bothered by it. \n\nHowever, the rest of the staff does not which is understandable since I rarely have interactions with them. I have been asked to go up to the main floor to hand over my findings, during those times I try to be friendly and i would say things like \"Hey man, how are you?\" To my male colleagues, I have been told keeping greetings informal like that is a great way to be seen as more friendly. \n\nI recently said this to colleague that I forgot is Trans. I tend to go based off physical appearance and this has gotten in trouble as a kid also. Just during the work week and when I am around others my brain just cannot process what I view as unnesscary information and that often comes in the form of names, preferences, birthdays among other things. \n\nIt is not to be rude or anything it took me three years to get my GF's name right. I still forget my parents, and my GF's birthday.\n\nThat being said during the HR meeting I was reprimanded, and they asked me to apologize and not to do it again. I did apologize but I told them I cannot promise that will not make such a mistake, if they wanted to avoid said mistake in the future they would have to wear a name tag with their pronous cause I probably will not remember this conversation or your face a week from now.\n\nI was just being honest, my GF understands where I am coming from she has been with me for 4 years, but she also said she could understand why those that do not know me as well view me as an asshole. \n\nAm I the asshole for being honest? If I am the asshole any suggestion how I can make it right?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Autism exists on a spectrum, and things that may come easily for me, may be extraordinarily difficult for someone else with autism. \n\nThe \"functioning\" labels don't properly delve into how complex autism is, and many people find them offensive. Of course, not speaking for all autistic people, but this is extremely important when talking about autism as a whole, and to say \"autism is autism is autism\" is terribly reductive, and diminishes the struggles that people with this **disability** face daily.\n\nETA if you\u2019re going to call yourself an \u201cautistic advocate\u201d on your profile, you seriously need to do a lot more research because what you wrote is so dangerously wrong, and spewing patented falsehoods on a public forum is irresponsible", "I don\u2019t understand. My SIL is severely autistic, has a 70 IQ, is violent, lives in a group home and couldn\u2019t participate on Quora. She\u2019s not working at law firms. Why do you question that it\u2019s a spectrum?", "Has the idea of accepting the fact that you cannot control other people's cognitive disabilities, or how they perceive you, ever occurred to you? Once?", "Weird baby like rant", "This is a tricky situation because in either situation, you\u2019re saying that someone\u2019s needs are of higher priority than the other person\u2019s needs which isn\u2019t fair to either party. I think we can and should show compassion to both people in the situation. OP isn\u2019t purposefully trying to misgender someone and they have a legitimate reason for struggling with names and pronouns. They should try to use gender neutral language, but that will take practice for them to implement. The trans individual is valid in feeling hurt by being misgendered, but will realistically not interact with OP often.", "Yeah but if they were offended because of his asshole, what use is it to be offensive to his asshole?", "So someone with a disability should not be taken into account. What if they were intellectually impaired? I\u2019ve worked with many developmentally challenged individuals. If I took offence to every miss assigned pronoun, wrong name or my appearance being commented on then I\u2019d never get any work done. Compassion goes both ways.", "Wow, what did I say that was bigoted?  You bully.\n\nEdit: oh haha, apparently I didn\u2019t notice the /s", "Studying the roster is a literal exercise used for people who struggle with names and faces. It\u2019s updated with all current employees. \n\nI\u2019m on the spectrum it\u2019s a literal coping skill, not attitude, it\u2019s about knowing and using the resources at your disposal to succeed in the workplace. \n\n\u2018Boss says \u201ctake this to xyz on the first floor\u201d \nFuck idk who xyz is let me double check it so I can be confident and aware going into this situation\u2019", "The \"study the roster\" advice is nothing new and is unrelated to the \"abruptly changing landscape of gender pronouns.\" It's just something people do when they know they struggle to remember faces and names and want to get better at it. I remember having quite a few teachers at school who openly admitted to spending time revising the register to avoid getting people's names wrong, even 10 years ago.\n\nRecommending practice and revision to address and improve your weaknesses isn't a bad attitude, it's the old standard recipe for growth. OP doesn't know any of their colleagues names, and studying the roster could help commit everyone to memory better than chance encounters do.", "Some people who consider themselves \u201cempathetic\u201d and \u201callies\u201d to all sorts of causes have no compunction about being horribly ableist.", "If you aren\u2019t comfortable working with women and non-binary folks then you need occupational therapy or something", "i\u2019m getting sexist vibes now.", "I don\u2019t know how you function.. but that\u2019s strange..", "You are not doing anything wrong and you shouldn't allow anyone to tell you otherwise. You are polite with colleagues and you interact with others when it's comfortable. No one, HR or anyone on reddit, has the right to tell you to put yourself in an uncomfortable situation or to behave in a manner that will upset you. Just as people feel it is wrong for someone to wear a badge so you can recognize their pronoun, it is equally wrong, if not worse, to expect you to apologize in advance when you have done nothing wrong, even if you end up using the wrong pronoun again. It will never be deliberate and your colleagues need to respect and appreciate this, as long as you are working to adjust.", "For me, spectrum indicates a line, when it\u2019s really more like a quadrant chart. It\u2019s not \u201chigh functioning\u201d or \u201clow functioning\u201d, more like higher needs vs lower needs.\n\nmy comment above copy pasted", "For me, spectrum indicates a line, when it\u2019s really more like a quadrant chart.

Someone literally saying this person doesn't deserve them trying to not misgender them does. Having a cognitive disability doesn't give you an excuse to be a dick. Something may be hard. But him not even being willing to TRY does make him a dick.", "It's in your job description to be professional. It's not a matter of someone's needs being higher than the other. It's unprofessional to misunderstanding someone just like It's unprofessional to call someone \"sweetheart\" at work. I agree with gender neutral language, but every response OP has given has shown that that isn't a priority for them.", "Are you implying that going to HR for corrective action is offensive?", "if op's doing something that would get him properly written up and spoken to by HR that's on OP,, not on the unlucky person they crossed paths with.", "You said the truth. How dare you.", "I'm gonna be honest, I don't trust the character of anyone who calls themselves empathetic or \"allied\" because it means they have an idealogical and political agenda, without fail. They're usually the biggest hypocrites.", "Absolutely OP could be more professional, not denying that, hence why I said they should work towards more gender neutral language. The trans individual deserves the respect of being gendered correctly, but where is the respect for OP\u2019s legitimate struggle? Quite frankly, pretending like OP is purposefully misgendering people is ableist.", "Going to HR over what OP said is completely ridiculous.", "It's an asshole move for something so easily corrected, \"Hi, I'm not a man by the way, how are you?\", consideration works both ways, the world shouldn't bend over backwards just because someone is trans. OP made a mistake and admits that, yet the other person has zero consideration for OPs own struggles while expecting everyone else to be considerate of their own. Being trans does not mean you cannot be an asshole.", "Is that what you got from my previous comment? I was literally just riffing about assholes", "It depends on how many times this exact situation has occurred. If it\u2019s the first time then yeah, going to HR to complain is over the top. The person could have just corrected OP at the time. A honest mistake is sometimes just that, a mistake. If it is continually repeated, then involve HR because you have gone through all of your other options.", "While he is not being purposeful in it, he has deemed it not important enough to fix.", "Stolen from somewhere else on this own post: Ever notice how people who think talking to HR is a bad thing tend to be assholes?", "And HR doesn't call employees to the carpet for a \"first offense.\"\n\nBetween that, and OP's responses in this thread, it's clear that it's not the complaint who's the asshole here.", "I\u2019m simply not finding where they said that", "Depends on the organisation and who is in HR. It also depends on how vocal the person is that is complaining. If a formal complaint has been made to HR even at the first offence, then it is going to be escalated."]}
