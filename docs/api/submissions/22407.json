What\u2019s that all about? Or is there more to the story such as behavioural or learning difficulties?

So, your sister is forced to come with you to your BF\u2019s house by your parents, she sits on the couch watching tv, you scold her for it, then you leave her alone in a strange house to go \u201ccuddle\u201d with your bf, then she comes in because she is hungry and in a strange house, so she asks/ tells you to make her something and you start calling her names and dragging her out of the room. She then starts crying and you call her even more names and get maf when she calls your parents. Who then blow up at you and somehow now the whole family knows and has an opinion. The only one who wasn\u2019t a massive asshole here is your sister. She should have asked you to make her something in stead of telling you to, but other than that she did nothing wrong. Your parents shouldn\u2019t have forced her to go with you and you were just a dick to her, when she wasn\u2019t at fault for being at your bf\u2019s house.

Some ten year olds no, I'm sure, but I imagine the bulk of them would be okay.", "The more important issue is the parents, here, though. Op needs to have a serious discussion with them, maybe involving a family member who has her back."]}
