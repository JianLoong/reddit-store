She then starts crying and you call her even more names and get maf when she calls your parents. Who then blow up at you and somehow now the whole family knows and has an opinion. The only one who wasn\u2019t a massive asshole here is your sister. She should have asked you to make her something in stead of telling you to, but other than that she did nothing wrong.

She should\u2019ve been the one scolded, not you because she not only disrespected you but your boyfriend and possibly his parents (if he still resides with them for whatever reason) because god forbid if she barged in on you both while you were making out or getting intimate! She needs to learn to grow up and that not everyone is going to cater to her nor will anyone hold her hand because the real world isn\u2019t going to before she ends up getting herself into some shit or worse, and she needs to learn QUICK. She\u2019s damn near grown, she shouldn\u2019t need anyone looking after her nor doing anything that she isn\u2019t FULLY capable of doing for her (i looked through the comments and have found confirmation that the sister is not disabled). Your parents need to stop babying a 16 year old, knowing damn well they probably didn\u2019t keep that same energy while raising you, and expecting you to also come at your sister\u2019s beck and call.

Of course, she turned on the TV wtf else was she gonna do. Of course she asked you for food it isn't her house, or even her friends house. She has no authority to make herself food.

Start looking for resources your school and/or city provides to low income students ASAP. Student discounts are awesome, keep your eyes peeled for them.\n\n\n\nNTA and if you don't already, put a password on your phone. That way if your mom or brother takes it or guilts you into giving it away, it's essentially useless except for emergencies. As a side note, be prepared to have little to no support from your mom when you're in college. The likelihood of her supporting you the way she has supported your brother appears slim to none.\n\n\n\n\nDon't be surprised when your mother tells you, \"I'm sorry sweetie but you're just going to have to drop out of college for a quarter because your brother broke his laptop so he needs yours since he's struggling with his first big boy job he and needs it more than you\" or \"we can't afford your textbooks this quarter, your brother ran out of groceries and since he's still learning how to be an adult he needs the help more than you.\"\n\n\n\n\nIf you know what college you're going to, I'd also start looking for resources to help support yourself if (when) your mom doesn't give you the same support she gave your brother. Keep your eyes peeled for student discounts! They're more common than you think. From discounts on public transit to food to healthcare to electronics to activities/events and more! Furthermore, many colleges/unis offer to rent/loan students laptops for a quarter should your mother/brother steal yours. A lot of students sell their used textbooks online for pretty cheap once they're done with them, so you should also check that out. Textbook rentals can also be belpful. The city I live in provides free phones and subsidized phone plans to poor people and students, you should check to see if there's a similar resource in your area. Some colleges have on campus foodbanks and clothing drives. Most student health centers can also get you set up with cheap or free hygiene supplies like toothpaste, hairbrushes, shaving gel, etc. You'll also probably be able to get a free or reduced cost public transit pass from your school or your city. If you're living off campus, you may also be able to get free or subsidized wifi from either your school, the city, or internet/cable companies offering student discounts. For example, Hulu and Spotify teamed up to give students both services bundled for $5.99 per month. There are a lot of resources at your disposal once you go to college! I'm honestly shocked your brother hasn't taken it upon himself to seek out said resources and lessen the burden on you and your mom.", "NTA - hitting walls in someone else\u2019s home at her age.
