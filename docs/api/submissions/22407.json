What\u2019s that all about? Or is there more to the story such as behavioural or learning difficulties?

So, your sister is forced to come with you to your BF\u2019s house by your parents, she sits on the couch watching tv, you scold her for it, then you leave her alone in a strange house to go \u201ccuddle\u201d with your bf, then she comes in because she is hungry and in a strange house, so she asks/ tells you to make her something and you start calling her names and dragging her out of the room. She then starts crying and you call her even more names and get maf when she calls your parents. Who then blow up at you and somehow now the whole family knows and has an opinion. The only one who wasn\u2019t a massive asshole here is your sister. She should have asked you to make her something in stead of telling you to, but other than that she did nothing wrong. Your parents shouldn\u2019t have forced her to go with you and you were just a dick to her, when she wasn\u2019t at fault for being at your bf\u2019s house. What a mess.", "NTa\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut your abusive parents are the problem, not your sister. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nTell them to take care of their kid themselves.", "She\u2019s 16 and only 2 years younger than you for god sake.

She can take care of herself", "NTA. your sister needed that lmao", "NTA - is your sister developmentally delayed or otherwise neurodivergent?\n\nThis sounds like something you'd experience with a six year old, not a teenager, I don't think I understand what really happened here because this story is just so weird. Why would you be expected to look after a girl who is already so old?", "Does your sister have a disability? If not, nta. If yes esh.", "She is sixteen? Years or months? That behavior is not acceptable. NTA.", "No the sister is acting like a freaking child", "Vote back pls", "She is a perfectly fine person and has no disabilities, she can look after herself but due to my parents babying her. She has never had to learn how to look after herself", "Actually facts my parent let all my brothers and I the option to stay home alone at 10 yo. She needs to grow up.", "Yep, this. NTA. If she insists on acting like a toddler, you should treat her like one. Put her in timeout in the corner.", "It's time she learns because no one is going to cuddle her in the real world. She's 16 not 6.\n\nNTA", "NTA.. time for her to grow up", ">  stay home alone at 10 yo.\n\nI used to be a camp counselor as a teenager and 10-11 y/o were my favorite (girls). \n\nI'm not a parent but I'd say in most cases, while people may disagree, I think 10 is capable enough to manage. Some ten year olds no, I'm sure, but I imagine the bulk of them would be okay.", "The more important issue is the parents, here, though. Op needs to have a serious discussion with them, maybe involving a family member who has her back.", "Info: what did you expect her to do whilst you \"cuddled\" if not watch TV?", ">**You are not your sisters keeper!**\n\nIt is not your job to watch her or parent her on how to behave correctly. That should have been done many moons ago.   \nShe is more than capable (I saw a comment saying she didn't have any disabilities) to be left on her own, to feed herself and be independent. It's about time your parents woke up and smelt the coffee - your young, you should be able to live your life for you without all these added expectations.   \n\n\nNTA but your parents and sister are!", "NTA. I\u2019ve seen a post similar to this one, so I\u2019m going to say what I said in that post over here: You are her SISTER, not her caregiver. She was completely out of line and disrespectful when she barged into another person\u2019s room, in another person\u2019s home, in a very vulnerable moment, to demand for YOU to make HER food. She should\u2019ve been the one scolded, not you because she not only disrespected you but your boyfriend and possibly his parents (if he still resides with them for whatever reason) because god forbid if she barged in on you both while you were making out or getting intimate! She needs to learn to grow up and that not everyone is going to cater to her nor will anyone hold her hand because the real world isn\u2019t going to before she ends up getting herself into some shit or worse, and she needs to learn QUICK. She\u2019s damn near grown, she shouldn\u2019t need anyone looking after her nor doing anything that she isn\u2019t FULLY capable of doing for her (i looked through the comments and have found confirmation that the sister is not disabled). Your parents need to stop babying a 16 year old, knowing damn well they probably didn\u2019t keep that same energy while raising you, and expecting you to also come at your sister\u2019s beck and call. That ain\u2019t how the world works and she\u2019ll find out the hard way.", "She's 16 she can be home alone and make her own food wtf?

Can you leave, you're 18, move out, go to school, do literally anything because this makes no sense.", "NTA - I thought you said your sister was 16 and not 2?", "She\u2019s 16.  Why can\u2019t she stay home alone?  Not only that, she\u2019s acting like a freaking 2 year old.

How is she supposed to survive adulthood and the real world?\n\nI was home alone by the time I was 9 or 10, and by the time I got into high school (I was only 13 when I started 9th grade) I would cook for myself regularly because I was going through a picky eater stage. Also, who needs to babysat in high school? I would be so embarrassed.", "You are 18.  Does your sister have a medical problem where she acts younger than her age?  16 is old enough to leave her alone at home.  Do not bring her with your on your time with your boyfriend.  You are not obligated to.", "NTA kicking the wall like a toddler absolutely not. Disgusting, childish behavior. Your parents are terrible for encouraging this.", "Also, why do family members always seem to Call???? My family is close knit and I have never seen this", "Because they\u2019re not bold enough to say it face to face."]}
