We've met a couple times just to hang out, watch movies, etc. We seem to get along well. \nWe discussed meeting up this week to watch a movie and have a couple drinks. So, yesterday, about 2pm, I texted him and asked if he'd like to hang out later tonight for dinner and a movie. He agreed. He said he wanted to nap for a couple hours first, but he'd message me when he woke up. I said that sounds good. I told him that would give me time to run down to the store and buy food to prepare for dinner tonight, and also tidy up the place a bit. \nWell the evening rolls around, and he never messages me. As time keeps passing. I realize he's probably not going to call, and then at 10:00 p.m., I'm hungry so I go ahead and eat a sandwich and go on to bed.\nAt 11:00 p.m., my phone rings, waking me up and it's him, saying he's about to head my way. He lives a 90-minute drive away, so that would have him arriving at my house well after midnight. \nI explained to him that I'm already in bed, asleep, and that it's pretty late, and I asked if we could just reschedule for another night.  He gets upset, saying that midnight is not that late, and I should have been more clear about what time I wanted to meet. Earlier, I had mentioned to him that since I'm off work this week I have a flexible schedule. He tried arguing that means I should be able to meet at any time. I told him, yes my schedule is flexible, but I still think midnight's too late. He continues to be angry and calls me inconsiderate for not having him over that late.\nI don't think I did anything wrong, but when I asked another friend about it, he also said midnight really isn't that late, and I should have let him come over.  Am I in the wrong here?

Not dinner and movie, right? Tell him he needs to work on his terminology so you\u2019re both clear on what you\u2019re agreeing too. Then you can schedule better.", "NTA\n\nYes, it is definitely weird for him to assume you would be fine for him to come over past midnight, especially considering the invite was for DINNER and a movie. Most people eat dinner between 6pm and 8pm. Some might eat a bit later, say 9pm or even 10pm. But nobody eats dinner at midnight.", "NTA obviously\n\nHe showed zero respect for your time and a big red flag for him getting angry after his unreasonable expectasions.", "NTA he was after something else I think", "NTA- the only people I know that want to meet up at midnight and that dont care that you are in bed already are just coming over to have sex and maybe because they need a place to crash. And sometimes they are also into drugs or have been put drinking. I would not trust him. He sounds manipulative. Calling you names for going to bed is not normal. Find someone better. Find someone who enjoys cooking WITH you and who actually WANTS to watch a movie and enjoy dinner.", "NTA. \n\nHe's out of his mind. And selfish. And boundary stomping. \n\nOk, I understand if there's a misunderstanding about the timing, but the moment you said that it was too late for you, he should have backed off. That's just basic politeness.\n\nPlus, do you really want to be in a relationship with someone who not only leaves you hanging for hours and hours, but then is belligerent when you move on with your own life instead of putting everything on pause for them? Guy is a major dick. \n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA.. who eats dinner at midnight??", "NTA. Midnight is way too late for someone with whom you have a casual relationship. Either he had other plans earlier and you were second tier or he was just making a booty call. And 30 is old enough to know better. If he wanted to make it that late, he should have communicated that to you much earlier and verified that it was okay first. That is so far outside the norm that you could not be expected to have said something beforehand. \u201cMy time is flexible, but I\u2019d prefer to eat dinner before 1 am, mkay?\u201d is not a normal predate convo for someone you\u2019re still getting to know.", "NTA, of course. He's not the asshole for the fact that he tried to come over that late, but he IS an asshole because he continued to pressure you into letting him come over, even getting angry/upset. A normal response would have been, 'I understand, would tomorrow evening work for you?' or something along those lines!!", "NTA\n\nGood riddance", "NTA. I read the first line as \u201chave been cheating with this guy\u201d before I uncrossed my eyes and read it again, but I think my eyes might have had it right. He doesn\u2019t seem trustworthy.", "NTA. Not even a close call. You have your healthy sleep routines and it is not to much to ask to have dates within that timeframe of your routines. These are healthy boundaries that you just drew in my opinion. It is in my book though, a big red flag that he responded angrily at your boundaries. You might want to look more carefully into that.....", "NTA. No one considers midnight a normal time for dinner and a movie unless that was the discussed plan before hand.", "No way.  Midnight is booty call time, if both if you aren't avowed late night peeps.\n\nThis guy is a pushy jerk. \n\nI bet that you were plan number 2, because it was so late.", "NTA.  Ghost this guy.  He's got bad intentions.  He wants to take advantage of you being tired.  When people are tired they don't always think clearly.", "NTA. Midnight is wayyy too late. Hell I'm 25 and if someone is trying to make plans past like 7:30 I say no lol. It's also kinda weird that he expects you to be fully available 24/7 for him and his whims just because you are off work.", "NTA, it\u2019s obviously cultural and I\u2019d personally put starting dinner and a movie in a more narrow time window but it could probably start somewhere between 5-10pm by normal standards. Not even *communicating* until 11pm is ridiculous even without the 1.5 hours distance. Arriving past midnight is either a booty call or an emergency.", "NTA that is way too late unless you\u2019re both shift workers, then maybe it could make sense. Worse though is his reaction to you saying \u201cdon\u2019t come over, it\u2019s too late\u201d. Jesus. What an entitled prick. He thinks you owe him time, company and affection when he wants it. It\u2019s not a good look.", "NTA. If at 2 PM he's napping \"for a couple hours,\" it's reasonable you didn't think you would hear from him 7 hours later.\n\nDinner to my parents is 4 PM. Dinner to me is 6 PM. I understand for others it could be 8 or 9 PM. But dinner at midnight is not the *norm* for any group of people. That's also the social cue for a \"hook up\" rather than a \"date.\" It sounds like he's not clearly communicating what he wants out of this.", "I\u2019m 42 and midnight is late!!! I\u2019m trying to remember if I thought it was late when I was 30. I really can\u2019t remember, sorry. It\u2019s gotta be his age.", "NTA. Who wants to eat dinner and watch a movie at midnight?? And the fact that he was angry over it rings alarm bells.", "Sounds like he was trying to basically force himself into \u201chaving to\u201d sleep over at your house [for sex].\n\nHe didn\u2019t want a \u201cdate\u201d, but really more a \u201cbooty call\u201d.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
