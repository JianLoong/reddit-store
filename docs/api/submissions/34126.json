Be honest with her about how she is impacting you. Be kind but be honest. Tell her you want to be close friends but you think she needs to understand how she is impacting the people around her. It sounds like she might be depressed.", "NTA. It sounds like your friend really needs some professional help at this point, which is well beyond what you are qualified to provide. Be kind, be caring, let her know you are getting very concerned about her and want to help her get help. Tell her you don't think enabling her to stay stuck in this bad place is healthy for her, and it's frustrating to you. Encourage her that you know she can be happy again, but needs to take steps to make that happen. Confronting this is hard, but kinder than ghosting her.", "NTA\n\nTalking about this over & over for hours a day / all 7 days of her trip is taxing to you.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf you do decide to call her; tell her you can only talk for a few minutes & then hang up after that time.", "NTA. It sounds like she would benefit from talking with a therapist. It's very reasonable for you to set a gentle boundary with her.", "NTA \n\nRemember, a therapists listen all day to problems, BUT THEY CHARGE. You are not a therapist, nor should all your time and energy be spent trying to be.", "NTA enough is enough with her breakup venting", "NTA\n\nHowever, you should probably tell her how you feel and encourage her to get a therapist or something instead of having her vent to you.", "Tell her the truth. She is focusing too much on her ex and needs to focus on now, not the past. That her constant focus on him is not healthy for her, or for you. \n\nYou can tell her that it is becoming to much, and that you want to focus on other things when you to are together. \n\nNTA", "Tell her the truth. Tell her that it's been six months, and she should be moving on instead of fixating like this. Tell her you're worried that this isn't going the healthy way, and that you lack the resources to help her.\nNTA for keeping your friendships healthier.", "NTA\n\nI'd suggest being kind and loving about it. Make clear you have nothing more helpful to say, and if she is not getting over it, she should find professional help to talk it over with.", "She needs therapy. Tell her you need to focus on your stuff and don't have the time to give her the attention she needs. Suggest therapy because this is beyond normal breakup stuff.\n\nYou may end up having to end the friendship. I've had to when people got too needy and demanding and didn't respect that I have my own needs.", "NTA. Sometimes a push that it's time to start moving forward is what people need, and it sounds like you're at a point where you need to give it to here.\n\nAt a point in life where I was depressed, it took someone to point out how negative I was being before I saw it. And once I saw it, I made a conscious effort to improve. I hope it's something like that for her.", "She is better off going to a tree hole, cheap and available 24/7.
