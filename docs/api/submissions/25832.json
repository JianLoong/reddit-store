I take my cart, go get the milk, and come  back to the end of the line. Yes I am annoyed at myself as I do it, but I do it.", "BS! You absolutely do not.  It is common for ppl to forget something and leave their cart in line to go get it. He waited 45 seconds before acting on his entitled ego. Stop blowing smoke up this assholes arse. He knew it was wrong, would you feel the same if you were the Woman?", "Happened to me twice. Both time I asked people behind me if it would be OK to run and grab one thing, and if they could watch my cart for some seconds. It never was an issue.", "Yeah I like to take one of my teen kids with me. They can run and get the thing I forgot while I stay in line lol.", "Your cart is your spot, it is an unspoken rule. OP is a jerk, god forbid he has to wait in line like everyone else then waits a full 45 seconds before he jumps one space ahead and intimidates the Woman whose cary it was, she forgot something and some asshole can't wait his turn. Mummy still does the grocery shopping doesn't she?", "Lol! Are you in high school? 'Please save my spot' Your cart is the spot. No approval required.", "I would let someone return to their spot if they asked. I would never give up my seat I intentionally picked on a plane. That\u2019s poor planning by the other party and I won\u2019t feel bad for saying no to that nor would I be the asshole.", "45 seconds after they moved the cart- it\u2019s not known how long the cart had been there before that.", "He came out guns ablazing for no reason lol", "They think you should wait behind their cart while they go back and continue to shop. Hell no. You\u2019re out of the queue at that point. You can get back in behind the people that got in while you were gone. \n\nWhere does this behavior become problematic to you? What if I enter the grocery store and put an empty cart in the checkout line, then go shop and when I\u2019m ready just walk up to the front of the line? Fuck all people who do this.", "And they're not waiting in line any longer than they would have if she was standing there. That's what people aren't getting. She didn't jump the line.", "Sounds like the difference is she didn't ask anyone to hold her place. She just assumed which is insane and rude.", "I can\u2019t get over the ridiculous number of downvotes. I would let the person in because it\u2019s the easier, kinder thing to do. We all need a little grace sometimes. I will never understand people who gatekeep this way. It sounds like a miserable way to live. \u201cBut I\u2019m riiiiiight!!!!\u201d", "Exactly.  If I'd gotten in line behind you guys and you told me that, I'd have no problem with letting her back in.  But she can't just walk away without telling anyone and expect her cart to hold her place in line, especially when the line is moving on without her.", "Wow! Ppl have ro get an advocate when they forget an item and leave their cart for a minute. If the old lady hadn't of asked would you have let someone move her cart and get ahead of her?  Then said 'you didn't have an advocate' when she came back? Too bad, so sad grandma. You would not think that person was a total asshole?", "Same. But the other day I realized I forgot something while in line, paid, and asked if I could leave my cart at customer service while I grabbed what I forgot. They were fine with it and let me pay at the CS desk and go on my way. I didn\u2019t hold up anyone except myself.", "Wild take. The person who passed the unattended cart as the line kept moving forward is the entitled one?\n\nIt may be common for people do to that, it doesn\u2019t make it okay. It\u2019s understandable if you\u2019re with someone else, because they can continue to move forward in the line.\n\nLeaving a cart in the line as it moves forward and expecting everyone else to just wait behind it is some juvenile nonsense.", "Loving the INCEL downvotes.", "A cart is not a spot. You go, you lose your spot. Period.", "This post is ludicrous. A cart does not mark a spot. A human standing in line marks a spot. Idk where you live, but where I live, at absolutely 0 grocery stores do you see checkout lines of only shopping carts. \n\nGod forbid people finish their shopping before trying to check out. She had enough shopping left to do for others to populate the queue and question whether or not this cart was left here intentionally. All she had to do if she wanted others to extend kindness is ASK someone to save her spot rather than presume.", "Do you realize you're the only person on this thread with that opinion?", "Yes I understand. And that is the difference. Giving up the seat costs you. Giving back the spot in line does not.\n\nHence I kinda consider not doing the latter an AH move. Because it is a small behavior that costs you next to nothing. \n\nOpposed to the former where I think a refusal is very much reasonable.", "OP had looked at the line, checked other lines, and came back. Unless the grocery store has 100 registers, that takes less than a minute. So, okay, maybe it was like a minute and a half this person was gone.", "If you can\u2019t see the difference between leaving a placeholder to grab one or two items you forgot and an entire shopping trip then I think any conversation we have will be useless.", "It\u2019s a favor to let someone back in line. Plain and simple. Doesn\u2019t matter how long they were gone or why they chose to leave the line, it\u2019s a favor to let them back in. While I definitely agree it\u2019s a kind thing to grant the favor, no one is obligated to oblige that favor. Especially if the person asking for the favor is demanding it instead or acting entitled to a spot in line.", "AITA is not a good place for moral judgements. I think it's all a bit \"don't tread on me.\"\n\nAlso in general the average user of this site is a bit dumb, so their opinion on any individual comment depends on how they feel about the OP. In one context they'd think \"of course it's fine to let people to get back into the queue,\" but because it was okay for OP to not do so in one instance, then anyone who suggests it's the right thing to do in any other instance in the same topic is the exact same as the entitled lady in OP's story.\n\nYou see it all the time.", "As I stated here, the old woman told me what she was doing: she was getting one item from nearby. So I knew 1) she WAS an old lady and 2) she would be right back. \n\nIn this case, if someone came up to the line, they would 99% certainty ask me if someone is in line. If the old woman had not said anything to me, I would tell them \"an old woman left this cart.\" Then it's the person's decision whether to leave the cart or move the cart. I'm not going to argue with them when it's them, not me, that is being inconvenienced. \n\nSince rhe old woman told me what she's doing, I could say with a moderate degree of confidence \"She went to grab one thing, she should be right back.\" This is generally enough info for most people to extend some understanding. \n\nAgain, as I stated, neither of these things were factors OP was able to confirm when attempting to get en queue. The person in front of the abandoned cart couldn't give any information about who left the cart and when they'd be back. Who is going to fight for a person who didn't even bother to take three seconds to ask another to save their spot?", "The line wasn't moving forward. He moved it out of the way and moved himself forward. It is rude af and I am really sure you would be AOK with it it if it was you.", "People frequently leave their cart to go get something they forgot. She was back in less than a minute. The line had not moved. It is an unspomen rule. OP felt bad afterwards because he was an asshole.", "Same. If I have a shopping buddy they\u2019ll hold my place (and start unloading the cart if needed) while I make a mad dash to get said item. Otherwise I either leave the line or just grab the item next time I come if it\u2019s not important", "I don't think it's excessive or impolite to simply *ask* people. They always can say no.", "Prob that the thing she was checking or getting could be easily carried in hand and she thought she\u2019d be faster without the cart", "It would be useless because you\u2019re not getting back in front of me.", "It\u2019s a favor that takes literally such little effort and lost time though. If you\u2019re not willing to give a stranger 45 seconds of grace and compassion you\u2019re kinda an AH in my opinion.", "I have never experienced this. This is either an unspoken rule in your head or wherever you live but clearly not everywhere. You\u2019re opinion about this is totally valid but the way you\u2019re writing makes you come across as rude and entitled. Also, the line has moved and no one seemed to know how long she had been gone.", "Not in NYC it's not. I'd think nothing of asking somebody to watch my cart for a second, or of watching *theirs* for a second while they grab that one last item.\n\nI might object if they were obviously playing around and doing all their shopping, of course! But that's different.", "What would the rest of the world do if it couldn't stereotype the US. Heaven forfend.", "> In other countries, people don't make a big deal about having to run off for 30 seconds because someone forgot to grab their semi-skimmed milk.\n\nI mean people in the U.S. don't really make a big deal of this either, but congratulations on getting to jerk that self-righteousness boner a little harder.", "Most Americans would let you back in line as well. This sub, and Reddit in general, is filled with people who don\u2019t know how to handle polite interactions with strangers", "Sorry, I don\u2019t care how small the effort is, I don\u2019t reward people being rude. Rude people can go to the back of the line. If they can\u2019t ask nicely, giving a simple acknowledgment that it is in fact a favor they\u2019ll be receiving, that it is in fact my grace they\u2019re requesting (as you called it), they are the ones being rude and entitled. \n\nDo society a favor, don\u2019t be a doormat and don\u2019t reward rude people when they\u2019re being rude. We\u2019ll all be better off that way, the world will be a much nicer place.", "Exactly. There are a lot of assholes here. All of whom would likely expect a bit of grace if the roles were reversed. But then again, the world is full of assholes. Being right all the time doesn\u2019t actually make people happy.", "If you\u2019re asking if I started making shit up that didn\u2019t appear in the post, I didn\u2019t.", "Not every store is a warehouse. Most of the people here are actually the assholes. The woman was fine, from OPs perspective, a total of 45 *seconds *. OP gets to the line and finds the car in front of her. Sounds like we can assume that woman who left the car was last on her line when she left. It also sounds like she may have forgotten one item, ran for it and come back, not mentioning to anyone because there was no one behind her to mention it to when she left. OP gets there and shoved the cart out the way and the woman returns 45 seconds later, and wasn\u2019t even argumentative about OP not letting her back in line? Yeah\u2026what a dick\u2026\n\nSo many of you just lack compassion or empathy, which is the root of so many of our contemporary problems.", "Commenter: *I leave the line to finish my shopping in order to not inconvenience anyone* \n\nYou: TYPICAL ME ME ME SELFISH MURRRICAN", "This \"oh those silly Americans\" attitude from the UK etc is so profoundly embarrassing. I have lived in the UK all my life and never once have I heard the notion that i need to discern what somebody is buying, and let them in front of me if it's a suitably small purchase.\n\nYou don't actually have to make everything about national stereotypes.", "Lol I\u2019ve been in OP\u2019s situation before, I stood behind the cart and pushed it along before the stranger returned, they said thanks I said no problem and it was all good. It\u2019s not being a doormat to be kind to strangers. I promise you that the lady did not leave that interaction learning she should be less entitled, she left it pissed off thinking that OP was such an asshole and likely wanted to go take her anger out on other people. Being rude to rude people doesn\u2019t lead society to be more kind, it leads to everyone being assholes to each others. We have no idea what is going on in other peoples lives that leads to their behavior. Showing compassion when someone is rude to you is FAR more impactful than showing more rudeness.", "LOL \u201cI want to thank my parents, Ayn Rand, and God.\u201d\n\nBut, u/hugedik confirmed it. Who\u2019s exaggerating now?", "you don't inconvenience anyone when leaving a queue and then returning before your go in the queue is finished\n\nProbably the autistic fella who doesn't leave the queue is worried they'll get a cap in their ass if they step out of line \\*hums stars and stripes\\*", ">I have lived in the UK all my life and never once have I heard the notion that i need to discern what somebody is buying, and let them in front of me if it's a suitably small purchase.\n\nThis is entirely what happens when you go to Aldi, Lidl, etc - somewhere with only cashiers, no self-checkouts and no ten-item-or-less queues. If you're buying a lot of things and the someone pops up behind you with one thing, the expected thing to do is to ask them if they would like to go in front of you.\n\nThey might be too polite to ask if they can go in front of you, but they'll be staring at the back of your head and thinking you're really impolite if you don't make the offer.\n\nAlso you don't need to discern what they're buying because you can see it with your own eyes.\n\nI challenge you to put it to the test! Go to Aldi, grab a water bottle, and stand in a queue of one person who is doing their full grocery shop. I bet you they'll say \"do you want to go ahead?\" the moment you put your water bottle on the belt, if not beforehand. I think it's 90% odds at least.\n\nTry it a few times and you'll be mortified at all those times you made someone wait 20 minutes for you to finish bagging up three weeks of shopping before they could spend ten seconds buying a chocolate bar for their hypoglycaemia"]}
