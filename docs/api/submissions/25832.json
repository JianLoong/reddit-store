I would have moved it.   A cart with a person while the other gets something and rejoins  is one thing. Me having loads of items and the person behind having 1 or 2 is a definite ask if they'd like to go in front.  This no. \n\n Why should her unmanned cart get moved up ?", "NTA but this is not a big deal for it to ruin my day or rant about it.

You weren't obligated to let her back in line, but haven't we all gotten up to the register, realized we forgot something, and dashed over to get it?

I guess it depends on her tone.", "NTA - the order of operations is:\n\n1) Finish your shopping\n\n2) Go line up. \n\nThough if you forgot something and it's close by, you can normally just tell the person behind you in line that you forgot something and are coming right back. \n\nMore egregious are the ones who stick a family member in line so it looks like nothing, then show up at the last second with a full shopping cart and four more family members with armloads of stuff and a complaint about coupons.", "Ehhhhh.... youre not an ASSHOLE but...it probably wasn't that deep. I think if it was that deep (you had a compelling reason to leave asap) you would've probs included the details on why in your explanation.

The Larry David in me says NTA. But, I\u2019m trying to get along with people more. With that being said, I think you should\u2019ve just let her back in line.  \n\nShe was absolutely not entitled to her spot back; but it\u2019s kind of like other situations, where it\u2019s better to de-escalate, rather than maintain the moral high ground.", "Yeah YTA she was very polite and you were snotty.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I probably would have let her go if she was polite.  You seemed to be the asshole in terms of content and tone.", "She was gone for long enough that OP could come and several people behind as well. I do agree to an extent but if it's important enough for me to need to leave I'd either let the person behind me know or just take the loss tbh.", "Carts don't hold places in line people do.

I wouldn't move this cart unless they were up next and weren't there bc we aren't going to delay everyone. If I was gone and back in a beat with my cart moved, I'd be annoyed but not say anything. \n\nIf people are gone for a long time - that's a different story. \n\nI do hate when there is a long line and you've been waiting a LONG time, and someone with a couple of items feels entitled and asks if they can go ahead of you. I said no, bc I was in a hurry and for some reason this line was taking forever. They were not happy and aggresive. Usually, I don't mind, but if someone asks in an entitled way - that their time is more important than mine - it's a no.", "NTA. I hate it when people do this.

I really should stop at this very moment and go grab my meal lol", "Nta you move, you\u2019re out of line.

I don't think that leaving your cart in line saves your place, but your tone sounds shitty and entitled.

She accepted his reasoning. I don't know why OP was still angry about it.", "Spot on.", "If you forget one item or grab an incorrect item that you're going to exchange, usually the person leaving the line will tell someone in the line (the person in front or behind them).

Sometimes when the store is particularly busy, I can get overwhelmed by all the people and end up missing an item. So this happens to me from time to time. But I also know that my time is not more valuable than anyone else\u2019s.
