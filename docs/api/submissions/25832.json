It is still the right thing to do it.", "This is one where I lean toward \u201cposting this question here at all makes me think you\u2019re a bit of an ass, regardless of the underlying facts.\u201d Just take the W (getting through the checkout marginally faster) and move on!", "People abandon trolleys in supermarkets all the time though.", "Well said!", "I would have moved it. A cart with a person while the other gets something and rejoins is one thing. Me having loads of items and the person behind having 1 or 2 is a definite ask if they'd like to go in front.", "Being obligated to let someone go ahead of you in line vs putting your cart back are two completely different things. Shouldn\u2019t even be compared. Lmao", "Classic am I the asshole comment. The lady didn\u2019t say she had run off to get an item yet you\u2019ve invented a whole backstory and run with it.", "Also if I forget something I just take my cart, get it and return to the back of the line. I\u2019m not going to expect anyone else to accommodate for me not being ready to check out.", "I get what you are saying, but the lady was the last person in line, there was no one behind her to let them know she forgot something or whatever the reason for her to leave her cart. OP was then the last one in the line, move over the cart, which they can do since they didn\u2019t know and 45 sec later the lady came back. NAH", "What do you think was the most likely cause for her to leave the cart like that? Genuine question", "Yeah, I can\u2019t imagine just abandoning a cart and then expecting to be let back in line. It\u2019s pretty entitled behavior.", "I genuinely don\u2019t know and I don\u2019t think it matters? This isn\u2019t am I the justified asshole.", "This sounds like an American society thing. In other countries, people don't make a big deal about having to run off for 30 seconds because someone forgot to grab their semi-skimmed milk.", "It was completely normal when I was in Germany and the queues were super long; it\u2019s pretty normal in the UK. Only most people ask if you can move their trolley.", "You can\u2019t imagine it? Really?\n\nThat is so strange. It\u2019s one thing to say you wouldn\u2019t do it, but can\u2019t imagine doing it. No circumstances would make you consider it. It would never cross your mind. Everyone who does it or even thinks it is an option is a flaming asshole.", "So you just assumed?", "At a guess, probably because American shops like Wal-mart are bloody massive and it takes minutes to get anywhere in them", "Yeah, such an American thing to expect someone who has to exit the line briefly to say something to the people around her on line so they know she\u2019ll be back. What a toxic thing to expect people to be polite and considerate of others.", "people have probably been shot in Wal-Mart for quickly nipping out of the queue for 30 seconds for a root beer and some ranch dressing, even though the cashier is going to ring them up within the next five minutes. \"Yeah sure, go grab your milk - over my dead body, punk!\" *Signals at AR-15.* \"Back in line, asshole.\"", "Doesn't matter if it delays you specifically. There are other people in the line. I also do let people go ahead of me frequently but not if people are also behind me, because it isn't just my call to permit that. If you're done shopping, be in the line. If you're not done shopping don't line up.", "Here the person would have been slowed down anyway, what are you defending exactly?", "We found the entitled person.", "Also agree with you and I'm in the UK. I think we can just chalk this up to the American 'me first' selfish attitude so many of them display.", "These downvotes to your perfectly reasonable comment are wild.", "Yeah, I can\u2019t imagine myself just abandoning a cart. What part of that statement is confusing to you?", "And the award for most overdramatic reading into a comment goes to...", "In this hypothetical, the person has asked.", "How are you waiting in line longer than you otherwise would if someone who is already in front of you runs to grab something?", "It doesn't delay anyone grabbing the milk, because the cashier still has to scan all the groceries in the time it takes you to grab the milk. It makes literally zero difference to the time it takes for you to finish your transaction in almost all cases - and I've never seen anyone do it at a time when it makes a difference either. People don't do it when they've finished bagging their groceries.", "that it's okay to leave the queue if you're not done shopping, although you ought to ask first, whereas Former-Inspector-400 said they would leave the queue and would not consider asking\n\nJust like a lot of reddit comments, it's not directly related to the OP, but instead relates to one of the comments under the OP.", "I think the entitled people are those who would not make a tiny concession to a stranger who asked politely for it when doing so would not delay them at all", "AITA is very selfish in general", "I'm in the UK, and the only time anyone does this is if there is more than one of you so one person grabs the item while the other stays in the queue, and it's one item you can grab REALLY quickly. You also let people in the queue know. The guy she asked thought the trolley had been abandoned (which happens all the time).\n\nI have never in my life experienced what is described above! I have once or twice been told \"sorry, I forgot X, can you save my place for me, and I oblige, but nobody just leaves their trolley without saying anything and expects to keep their place in the queue!", "She asked after she returned. That\u2019s not being polite or considerate.", "Your values aren\u2019t the same as everyone else\u2019s and I hope the responses to your comments here are making that clear to you.", "I used to be a cashier and people would do this all the time. They do not always come back in time so I'd just pass the people behind them. They were always so shocked. If she was gone long enough so that a few more people came in the line, then yeah she should have taken her cart with her", "yeah I'm replying to the autistic guy who refuses to ask and just leaves the queue and joins it again at the back, rather than the OP", "Yes but I'm not talking about the OP, I'm talking about whatever commenter said they would never even ask and would just leave the queue, and the other guy whiskeybizoot who said this is the right thing to do and you should only join the queue when you have finished shopping", "if someone says \"can I pop in front of your \u00a3200 worth of groceries so I can buy this bread\" or \"can I just run and get some milk\" and you say \"no\" then you are TA unless you have some exceptional excuse. You're not neutral. AITA would say you're neutral but in reality doing so would be outlandishly bad.\n\nIf you said \"no\" to me then I might be tempted to halt the cashier, undo my transaction and then take some time loading my grocery cart back up so I can go back and get the milk. I forgot the milk, so I should take everything off the belt!", "I don't trust AITA to provide me the viewpoints of rounded members of society, especially when it's clearly full of people who are aggrieved at making tiny concessions for strangers", "yeah I don't dispute that the OP acted normally, and you shouldn't really leave the queue when doing so would lead to a delay either"]}
