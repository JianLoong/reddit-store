It sounds like she was absent for more than a minute.  Back of the line she goes!  It's ok to remind people they aren't the only ones on this planet.", "NTA. Snooze ya lose. Leave ya grieve. Step out yer kicked out.", "NTA - There is a difference between being an ah and not being a doormat. She left the queue. Leaving your cart does not save your place in line. Honestly, just leaving her cart there makes her an AH. You stood up for yourself. You should feel good about that.", "Nta, literally at all. Common sense really isn't that common.", "NTA.   I would have moved it.   A cart with a person while the other gets something and rejoins  is one thing. Me having loads of items and the person behind having 1 or 2 is a definite ask if they'd like to go in front.  This no. \n\n Why should her unmanned cart get moved up ?", "NTA but this is not a big deal for it to ruin my day or rant about it. I\u2019ve had a couple of incidents like this one and I either went ahead or let the other person originally on line go ahead as long as it wasn\u2019t my turn yet. Shit happens", "I'm going against the grain with NAH. You weren't obligated to let her back in line, but haven't we all gotten up to the register, realized we forgot something, and dashed over to get it? When that happens to me, I hope the people around me are understanding.", "IDK seems like an easy enough time to show kindness she probably forgot something.  I guess it depends on her tone.", "NTA - the order of operations is:\n\n1) Finish your shopping\n\n2) Go line up. \n\nThough if you forgot something and it's close by, you can normally just tell the person behind you in line that you forgot something and are coming right back. \n\nMore egregious are the ones who stick a family member in line so it looks like nothing, then show up at the last second with a full shopping cart and four more family members with armloads of stuff and a complaint about coupons.", "Ehhhhh.... youre not an ASSHOLE but...it probably wasn't that deep. I think if it was that deep (you had a compelling reason to leave asap) you would've probs included the details on why in your explanation. You saved maybe 2-10 minutes. \n\nYTPWUMSDW (youre the person who unnecessarily makes someone's day worse)", "[deleted]", "I\u2019ve learned to not let these things get to me. I would have just let her take her spot back. I\u2019m not in that much of a hurry to where I cant stay two extra minutes. All it is is an ego battle. Although, I can respect people who don\u2019t want to give up their spot if somebody leaves. I think your passive aggressive comment was rude though. So for that, \n\nYTA.", "NTA.\n\nYou were right to refuse her.\n\nWhen this happens to me (having to deal with queue-jumping divas) I tell them they are not allowed in front of me but that if they wish to get behind me, they need to prove to me they have the consent of each and every person behind me.\n\nBeyond everything else, I have no right to make those behind me wait longer for their turn.", "Doesn\u2019t sound like there was any conflict.  The Larry David in me says NTA. But, I\u2019m trying to get along with people more. With that being said, I think you should\u2019ve just let her back in line.  \n\nShe was absolutely not entitled to her spot back; but it\u2019s kind of like other situations, where it\u2019s better to de-escalate, rather than maintain the moral high ground.", "Yeah YTA she was very polite and you were snotty.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Every time someone\u2019s left their cart expecting it to hold their place in line, they\u2019ll usually ask the person in front or behind them to please watch their cart while they go grab something, at least in my experience", "Meh.  I probably would have let her go if she was polite.  You seemed to be the asshole in terms of content and tone.", "She was gone for long enough that OP could come and several people behind as well. I do agree to an extent but if it's important enough for me to need to leave I'd either let the person behind me know or just take the loss tbh.", "Carts don't hold places in line people do. I thought this was a very common rule. If not there would be too much chaos at the checkout lines. Sure he could have been nicer but wasn't rude."]}
