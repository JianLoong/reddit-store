I work from home for a tech company and have a flexible schedule, which allows me to do more of the household chores. I make a great salary and I\u2019m specialized, so I also pay the majority of the bills.\n\nRecently, my girlfriend has been asking me to help her grade papers after she comes home from work or on weekends. I understand that being a teacher can be a tough job, but I'm starting to feel like it's becoming an expectation for me to help her with her work. I\u2019m already doing my fulltime job and the majority of the household chores, so taking on her work has gotten old fast. \n\nI've tried to explain to her that I have my own work to do, and that I need my free time to recharge and take care of my own responsibilities. But she keeps insisting that I help her, saying that it's \"just a few papers\" or that \"it won't take long.\" It does take a long time. She already spends all weekend with the work unless I help which gives us both Sundays off. \n\nI'm starting to feel resentful and like my time and effort are not being valued. I already do a lot to contribute to our household, and I feel like helping her with her work is not my responsibility. I love and support her, but I also need to prioritize my own well-being. I have been starting to think it\u2019s time to take a break from one another just so I can live a little bit, but I don\u2019t think she could afford to live on her income alone, and honestly, I really do love her. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to help my girlfriend grade papers?", "created_utc": 1682442756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yplsf/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_girlfriend_grade/", "score": 140, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The verbiage may be a bit harsh - but let her know you're so confused and frustrated you actually went to the internet to ask strangers because you are so confused about this.  Let her know that you adore her, but you didn't sign up to work a part time job that you're not getting paid for and while she may see it as you \"bonding\" you don't see it that way.    \n\n\nI'm really sorry you're going through this, OP.  Is she an English teacher?  She could choose to assign different types of projects too so it's not papers every single week.  Her students would appreciate a change-in-pace as well.", "Wait a minute, I\u2019m totally confused:\n\nHow does relying on your help to grade papers translate to her students having food and clothing?  \n\nUnless I missed something, this sounds like gaslighting.", "NTA\n\nYou don't ask her to do your assignments for you. Same thing, isn't it?\n\nThe next time she asks you, tell her no and explain the reason. An argument is better than the resentment you're feeling right now.

Not only are you doing your own job, but you've taken up most of the household chores.   And  she STILL demands that you help her.   Put your foot down and don't do any more of her grading.  See how the chips fall.  If she lashes  out  and gives you the cold  shoulder, then you're right.  Time for a long break.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think she could afford to live on her income alone\"\n\nI guess she'll have to get a roommate, then.  Her problem, not yours.", "NTA - this task is for her role as a teacher & she is paid accordingly as such.\n\nETA - after reviewing some of OPs comments I think it boils down to this:\n\nGF wanted to be a teacher and became a teacher knowing full well it\u2019ll be huge time commitment outside of working hours and she would be paid a lower wage because the US sucks at taking care of our teachers. \n\nOP decided to take a different job that suits his interests and how much time commitment he wants to put into it. Allowing him more time for household chores/care for his GF.\n\nGF asks for help from OP and while both parties are each reaching their max capacity of energy\u2026 GF isn\u2019t being respectful of OP\u2019s decline. You can ask for help but when they say no you gotta respect that. \n\nIn regards to the other insights to OPs relationship, it seems OP feels overwhelmed and exhausted with all these activities that require energy and he\u2019s seeking a way to relax without feeling guilt for saying no to his GF. Even mentioning that he doesn\u2019t feel she can move out because she can\u2019t afford it. That\u2019s not your responsibility OP.

I'm a teacher and it is MY job not my partner's. When I grade papers I realise who struggled or not and if I should do a lesson again on something specific or not.

But maybe it's different because I'm French and we have more time to grade...", "NTA. She can\u2019t have everything and she\u2019s trying to do too much. She will lose you as a result.

Something has to give.", "NTA, and your girlfriend needs to learn how to pace herself, or she's going to burn out, and burn you out, and end up unable to help anyone at all. She's doing amazing work but it needs to be sustainable.", "This is absolute BS. I get that the way we treat teachers in the US is awful, but this is not the solution. You should NOT be helping with her work duties- it\u2019s completely inappropriate and not fair to the students. No offense, but you\u2019re not qualified to do her job for her- you work in a totally different industry and it doesn\u2019t make sense that the skills/knowledge would be transferable.

That's way out of line. I'm in education and it would never occur to me to ask somebody else to help with marking papers!!!", "NTA. Sounds like she should be assigning less homework, especially to \"at risk\" kids, as you say, who are less likely to have time/space/resources at home to do homework.", "NTA. She's massively violating her students' privacy and the ethical standards of her profession by letting you read them, much less grade them. This isn't just laziness, this is a huge ethical failing that very much will bite her in the ass eventually. She needs to find a new line of work and you need to find a partner who doesn't suck. \n\nSeriously, grading papers sucks, but it's literally her job to assess and provide feedback on student work. SHE is the one with the qualifications to do so and the understanding of what she asked in the assignment prompt. This isn't just exploitative and unfair to you, but fraudulent to her employer and a huge violation of student privacy.", "INFO:\n\nWhat age group does she teach?\n\nDoes she have a daily free period, other than meal break(s), which is intended to allow her to do things like grade papers during the school day?\n\nIn my district this is the case, but I know that a lot of teachers like to use this as \u201cdown time\u201d to bs and socialize with other staff", "NTA, her job isn\u2019t your job, therefore, it\u2019s her responsibility, she has the right to ask, but you also have the right to say no as it is not your job, also, she\u2019s grading kids papers, this might be a violation of a school policy, or something, idk", "NTA\n\nYou need to decide the nature of your relationship.

No. That is completely unsustainable, and both she and the administration should realize that (whether they do is another story, but\u2026). She is not a social worker.\n\nBottom line is that she needs to truly understand how you feel, and how terrible her boundaries are. I\u2019m sure it might be tough to be the only one not participating in packing boxes or doing after school whatever (though I have a very hard time believing that every teacher is doing this during every planning period and afternoon), but she needs to use her grading and planning time to actually grade and plan. Harsh as it may sound, but these kids have parents, guardians, someone who need to do more.

That\u2019s what a real teacher thinks and says.", "Are you comfortable with how involved she is?  Can you see this for your long-term?    \n\n\nHonestly, if she's assigning THAT many papers for at risk kids - that's super tough as most will not have computers at home (unless it's one of the fancy schools that provides computers)  There are other tasks that she can encourage writing, reading, analytical thinking that won't involve grading papers.    \n\n\nAlso, as 9th graders, they need to stsart practicing short-form writing and professional communication, so practicing verbiage in emails, analytical thinking about how to take information from a hypothetical business meeting, and then how to crunch and communicate to a team - those are shorter things to grade and way more applicable than an analysis on if Falkner had hidden meanings in his works or not (he didn't by the way :) )    \n\n\nALLLLL that to say, here's my biggest concerns OP:  \n\n\nI say this with a hug and a beer or mocktail:  \n1) you are developing resentment and resentment is the death-sentence to a long term relationship.    \n2) She's NOT LISTENING to what you are saying.  I would encourage you to rephrase what you have told her in the past - and again, show her exactly what you wrote here!  It will be a wake-up call. If she stillllll doesn't listen?  That's a huge red-flag.  \n3) You sound compassionate, intelligent, caring, collaborative, and like a communicator.  Truly, my dude, you're a catch.  And you're succesful?  Hell yeah.  You're a catch.  She's compassionate, committed, and protective of her students which are also great attributes.  But here's the \"but.\"  BUT are you right together? Because (please excuse me if this is too harsh) it sounds like she's taking advantage of you.  And that's crappy.  \n\n\nShe is doing God's work - that's SO tough.  I have a cousin-in-law who teaches Chemistry at an at-risk-youth school and the stories he tells.... It's so sad.  BUT her career choice does NOT get to determine your roles as boyfriend (and in the future, fiance? Husband??)  Can you see yourself doing exactly this for 15 years?  OR does something need to give?  \n\n\nI'm sending so much love to ya dude.  You aren't alone.  And she isn't either. But I think both of you need to find balance - and this situation isn't it :(", "Woof. She wants to save everyone, and while that\u2019s admirable, you can\u2019t save her from herself.", "Ooof, she is heading for burnout city. Dedicated teachers may work their hearts out trying to hands-on help their own kids, but wise teachers focus on setting up volunteer systems & seeking grants/donations to help MORE kids.\n\nExample: teachers can spend time every day packing lunches with food they themselves donated OR they could try to set up food bank volunteers to do a weekly packing party & solicit online donations for a school snack pantry.", "Your response should be, this is what you signed up for and knew the amount of effort you put into that doesn\u2019t equate to equal pay, however that is out of our control.\n\nShe needs to respect that partners do not equate to free help either", "Can you explain to me how your helping grade papers puts food in the bellies of her students on weekends? Sounds like your GF has time management issues she needs to work on.", "If she feels like she isn't being paid enough she should get a different job. She can martyr herself all she wants, she can't voluntold you too.", "Yeah, I'm baffled over this one. Got to say. But this is reddit, so I guess that's just silly of me, lol!", "As someone who has worked in education, this is where my mind went too. Of course the school may have some expectations on how often homework is assigned, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s more likely one of the reasons you mentioned.", "That's very manipulative of her.\nShe doesn't get her way so she gives you the silent treatment. \n\nSounds like you two need to have a serious sit down conversation where you clearly explain your boundaries.\nYou already do more of the housework and you definitely should not and do not need to be doing her work as well", "You're definitely NTA, but is this a new routine or has it been going on all school year? If she's working all weekend then she may be legitimately overwhelmed, in which case she should make changes at work. Fullstop. My sibling is a teacher and apparently end of school year is a tough time because of the scramble by poor students to pass and angry parents with failing kids to crawl out of the woodwork. Ask her if she can really help those kids if she's burned out, weeping at night, and enlisting loved ones for basic job duties? It's literally why some teachers don't last in the school system and why your relationship might not survive it either.", "I am a teacher. Grading takes up a huge amount of my time. I hate it. But it's a necessary and important part of my job. She needs to learn to grade more effectively; she might be spending too much time on each paper. At any rate, she could get in trouble for making you do her work because if the school finds out they'll be upset that she let someone who's not a teacher do her job for her. Do not let her pressure you into this. She may need to consider another line of work if she really can't handle this. Teaching is a stressful job, and it's not for everyone. She is wrong to make you do her work. She also needs to do her own grading so that she'll become familiar with her students' strengths and weaknesses.", "Yeah. The the heartbreaking truth is that when you work against injustice in the world, you're going to have to learn to stop before all the work is done, because the work will never be done. I wonder if there's any good resources for volunteer organisations about help worker burnout she could use, because it's much the same problem.", "What on earth does grading their papers have to do with food or clothing?", "Can she create rubrics and have them assess each other's work as a class activity? That is generally allowed under ferpa, and also lets the students see how other writers approach the same prompt - they can recognize mistakes without having to make them themselves and learn from one another's strengths.", "They are doing a good thing so I feel for her, but ob you did not sign up for this and she needs to find a way to manage how she wants to help her students and do her job without relying on you to do her job. \n\n\nI really do understand but you should not feel guilty that she will not be able to afford to live alone. I think once the thought of taking a break has entered your mind it\u2019s something that will not go away and will always be in the back of your mind\u2026take a break and may be you guys can see where you are going and if you are right for each other\u2026may be with her not having your support and having to do her job, helping kids and doing housework will make her appreciate what you do and not take it for granted.", "Setting aside the professional issues, I don't think someone is an asshole to ask their partner to help them actually get a day off.", "I feel like in the US it\u2019s a soft illegal but everyone acknowledges that teachers go above and beyond so they\u2019re willing to overlook a FERPA violation because at the end of the day, the grades are getting submitted in a timely manner.", "If he picks #2, it\u2019s going to end in a break up anyway.  He\u2019s not going to like that she can never spend time with him, she\u2019s going to get resentful that he gets free time and she doesn\u2019t.", "Teachers are paid based on the premise that they can get their work done during school hours, while at the same time their prep hours are being cut and they have no classroom aides. There is no \"taking it up with her employer\" in the context of public schools. She has to do the paper work (like grading) after hours/on the weekends even though her salary is low. This is why school districts are bleeding experienced teachers and can't find new hires.", "It's not weird for different people to enjoy different things.", "Eh, we have private academies here because the schools are shite from 9th to 12th grade, and I\u2019m really close with my teacher.\n\nI\u2019ve been helping him grade for 2 ish years now and I love doing it, another friend of mine despises it beyond belief. People have things they like and dislike, and OP is just someone who dislikes grading papers", "Exactly \ud83d\udc4c she would NEVER ask us for help with grading!", "This comment is it.\n\nPlease accept my \ud83c\udfc6 though it's not a very big one it's what I had coins for!\n\nOP wishing you very bestest to navigate a way through this. NTA", "This comment is amazing and wonderful", "This is a smart idea - if there are needs the students need met, bring in help from the community instead of the teachers trying to parent 100s of kids. Then she can actually focus on teaching and wouldn't be pulled so thin that she can't grade papers.", "https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yplsf/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_girlfriend_grade/jhoeo25?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button", "With that being the only info, no. But you really can't set aside the professional issues here.", "Asking is okay but everything after determines if someone is the A H or not. OP wrote in a comment that the last time he didn't help his gf gave him the silent treatment. Asking is okay but then you also have to be okay with a no.", "Okay, but the point is job duties and compensation is between a person and their employer. You don't dump these duties on someone else.", "Problem is, I don't think OP can be excused for not knowing this is problematic that a non-school person is grading student papers. \n\nSo, in my mind, best to just leave it out.", "How is silent treatment not being ok with something though? I disagree with that.", "The issue isn't just that it's school work. It's that it's her work.\n\nI don't need to know what somebody's job is for me to think it's an asshole move to ask others to do it for them.", "Do I understand it right that you're okay with silent treatment in a relationship?", "I think everyone should have the right/ability to fallback/retreat to some personal time in a relationship. Sometimes, you don't feel like communicating especially when you've asked for help and been told no. Even if your request was unreasonable, its reasonable to need to lick your wounds for a lil bit when rejected.", "In a healthy relationship you communicate that you don't want to talk and need a moment for yourself. \n\n\"What is the [Silent Treatment](https://www.choosingtherapy.com/silent-treatment/#:~:text=in%20this%20video%3A-,What%20is%20the%20Silent%20Treatment%3F,friends%2C%20or%20co%2Dworkers.)? The silent treatment is\u00a0a refusal to verbally communicate with someone, often as a means of punishment, emotional manipulation, or control. Although this type of behavior is more common in an intimate or romantic relationship, it can also happen with family members, friends, or co-workers.\"\n\nEdit: you to yourself.", "For me whats critical is this:\n\n> often as a means of punishment, emotional manipulation, or control. \n\nIf you aren't doing it for that reason, its ok. Not everyone has the capacity to communicate a need for silence in the moment your asking. Maybe they had capacity at an earlier time and now thats gone. \n\nEven in OP's example, he didn't help her with papers so she was silent and crying. While its understandable OP sees that from perspective as this emotion is directed at OP, very possible GF is just overwhelmed and trying to reconcile her overtaxed life.", "All perfectly understandable but this has to be communicated. It's a reason not an excuse. \n\nOP talked to her a few times (according to the comments) and OP can't do more than that. If gf doesn't communicate (even if the reason is understandable) then she can't expect OP to accept it in the long run. He shouldn't feel like an A H just because he said no."]}
