I work from home for a tech company and have a flexible schedule, which allows me to do more of the household chores. I make a great salary and I\u2019m specialized, so I also pay the majority of the bills.\n\nRecently, my girlfriend has been asking me to help her grade papers after she comes home from work or on weekends. I understand that being a teacher can be a tough job, but I'm starting to feel like it's becoming an expectation for me to help her with her work. I\u2019m already doing my fulltime job and the majority of the household chores, so taking on her work has gotten old fast. \n\nI've tried to explain to her that I have my own work to do, and that I need my free time to recharge and take care of my own responsibilities. But she keeps insisting that I help her, saying that it's \"just a few papers\" or that \"it won't take long.\" It does take a long time. She already spends all weekend with the work unless I help which gives us both Sundays off. \n\nI'm starting to feel resentful and like my time and effort are not being valued. I already do a lot to contribute to our household, and I feel like helping her with her work is not my responsibility. I love and support her, but I also need to prioritize my own well-being. I have been starting to think it\u2019s time to take a break from one another just so I can live a little bit, but I don\u2019t think she could afford to live on her income alone, and honestly, I really do love her. \n\nSo, AITA for refusing to help my girlfriend grade papers?", "created_utc": 1682442756, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12yplsf/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_girlfriend_grade/", "score": 352, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The verbiage may be a bit harsh - but let her know you're so confused and frustrated you actually went to the internet to ask strangers because you are so confused about this.  Let her know that you adore her, but you didn't sign up to work a part time job that you're not getting paid for and while she may see it as you \"bonding\" you don't see it that way.    \n\n\nI'm really sorry you're going through this, OP.  Is she an English teacher?  She could choose to assign different types of projects too so it's not papers every single week.  Her students would appreciate a change-in-pace as well.", "Wait a minute, I\u2019m totally confused:\n\nHow does relying on your help to grade papers translate to her students having food and clothing?  \n\nUnless I missed something, this sounds like gaslighting.", "NTA\n\nYou don't ask her to do your assignments for you. Same thing, isn't it?\n\nThe next time she asks you, tell her no and explain the reason. An argument is better than the resentment you're feeling right now.

Not only are you doing your own job, but you've taken up most of the household chores.   And  she STILL demands that you help her.   Put your foot down and don't do any more of her grading.  See how the chips fall.  If she lashes  out  and gives you the cold  shoulder, then you're right.  Time for a long break.\n\n\"I don\u2019t think she could afford to live on her income alone\"\n\nI guess she'll have to get a roommate, then.  Her problem, not yours.", "NTA - this task is for her role as a teacher & she is paid accordingly as such.\n\nETA - after reviewing some of OPs comments I think it boils down to this:\n\nGF wanted to be a teacher and became a teacher knowing full well it\u2019ll be huge time commitment outside of working hours and she would be paid a lower wage because the US sucks at taking care of our teachers. \n\nOP decided to take a different job that suits his interests and how much time commitment he wants to put into it. Allowing him more time for household chores/care for his GF.\n\nGF asks for help from OP and while both parties are each reaching their max capacity of energy\u2026 GF isn\u2019t being respectful of OP\u2019s decline. You can ask for help but when they say no you gotta respect that. \n\nIn regards to the other insights to OPs relationship, it seems OP feels overwhelmed and exhausted with all these activities that require energy and he\u2019s seeking a way to relax without feeling guilt for saying no to his GF. Even mentioning that he doesn\u2019t feel she can move out because she can\u2019t afford it. That\u2019s not your responsibility OP.

I'm a teacher and it is MY job not my partner's. When I grade papers I realise who struggled or not and if I should do a lesson again on something specific or not.

But maybe it's different because I'm French and we have more time to grade...", "NTA. She can\u2019t have everything and she\u2019s trying to do too much. She will lose you as a result.

Something has to give.", "NTA, and your girlfriend needs to learn how to pace herself, or she's going to burn out, and burn you out, and end up unable to help anyone at all. She's doing amazing work but it needs to be sustainable.", "This is absolute BS. I get that the way we treat teachers in the US is awful, but this is not the solution. You should NOT be helping with her work duties- it\u2019s completely inappropriate and not fair to the students. No offense, but you\u2019re not qualified to do her job for her- you work in a totally different industry and it doesn\u2019t make sense that the skills/knowledge would be transferable.

That's way out of line. I'm in education and it would never occur to me to ask somebody else to help with marking papers!!!", "NTA. Sounds like she should be assigning less homework, especially to \"at risk\" kids, as you say, who are less likely to have time/space/resources at home to do homework.", "NTA. She's massively violating her students' privacy and the ethical standards of her profession by letting you read them, much less grade them. This isn't just laziness, this is a huge ethical failing that very much will bite her in the ass eventually. She needs to find a new line of work and you need to find a partner who doesn't suck. \n\nSeriously, grading papers sucks, but it's literally her job to assess and provide feedback on student work. SHE is the one with the qualifications to do so and the understanding of what she asked in the assignment prompt. This isn't just exploitative and unfair to you, but fraudulent to her employer and a huge violation of student privacy.", "INFO:\n\nWhat age group does she teach?\n\nDoes she have a daily free period, other than meal break(s), which is intended to allow her to do things like grade papers during the school day?\n\nIn my district this is the case, but I know that a lot of teachers like to use this as \u201cdown time\u201d to bs and socialize with other staff", "NTA, her job isn\u2019t your job, therefore, it\u2019s her responsibility, she has the right to ask, but you also have the right to say no as it is not your job, also, she\u2019s grading kids papers, this might be a violation of a school policy, or something, idk", "NTA\n\nYou need to decide the nature of your relationship.

No. That is completely unsustainable, and both she and the administration should realize that (whether they do is another story, but\u2026). She is not a social worker.\n\nBottom line is that she needs to truly understand how you feel, and how terrible her boundaries are. I\u2019m sure it might be tough to be the only one not participating in packing boxes or doing after school whatever (though I have a very hard time believing that every teacher is doing this during every planning period and afternoon), but she needs to use her grading and planning time to actually grade and plan. Harsh as it may sound, but these kids have parents, guardians, someone who need to do more.

That's a huge red-flag.  \n3) You sound compassionate, intelligent, caring, collaborative, and like a communicator.  Truly, my dude, you're a catch.  And you're succesful?  Hell yeah.  You're a catch.  She's compassionate, committed, and protective of her students which are also great attributes.  But here's the \"but.\"  BUT are you right together?

Do not let her pressure you into this. She may need to consider another line of work if she really can't handle this. Teaching is a stressful job, and it's not for everyone.

Is she teaching a HS writing class or something else with a lot of essays and details to wade through? Is she setting too short of a deadline for herself on returning those papers? Are there things she can do to adjust the weekend workload, or is it truly the nature of her position when done right and well?\n3.

An example for that last point: She tells YOU, \"It's just a few papers. It won't take long.\" If that's true, then she doesn't really NEED the help because for HER it should also be \"just a few papers; won't take too long.\"\n\n1. Is it her habit to expect/demand (but not explicitly)? Those aren't good traits.\n2. Does she expect you to be/provide the solution to whatever challenges she has?
