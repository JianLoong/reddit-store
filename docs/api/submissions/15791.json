How on earth is it more socially appropriate and respectful to outright refuse to answer or discuss personal life related topics, than just not disclosing your sexual preference (which is extremely irrelevant, as well)?", "I hope this gets a thousand upvotes", "BUTTSCRATCHER!", "No I just yawned WHILE scratching my butt, thanks a lot", "Either homophobia or generalised overreaching and nosiness. Completely inappropriate either way of course.", "Correct the assumption. \n\nIf you've ever talked to anyone, not correcting an assumption about something is often seen as tacit approval. \n\nI wear a lot of blue so people assume my favorite color is blue, my favorite color is green. If someone gave me a blue shirt as a gift and told me they \"picked the color because it's my favorite\", if I don't correct them, then I'm tacitly approving that my favorite color is blue. They get the perception that I'm agreeing with their assumption. The perceived agreement is the lie. This is why OP just kinda sucks. \n\nBeing upset about being wrong about an assumption is the reason the colleague sucks. They made the assumption which is stupid, but OP also never corrected them when they could have and didn't have a reason not to.", "I'm not telling you what you should do. I'm telling you how I would react to it. I'd rather someone refuse to talk about something instead of allowing me to have a false perception of the topic because they never corrected me. In this situation I'd be more understanding if I were the colleague, but I'd still be upset that OP never corrected me.", "I don't allow people that I respect to make mistakes based on assumptions. If I don't intend to correct their mistake, it's better to refuse to speak about things relevant to the mistaken assumption.\n\nI don't view refusing to speak about something as disrespectful at all. I can't say the same for other people though.", "Ok here\u2019s an example scenario:\n\nColleague: hey OP what did you get down this weekend with your husband?\nOP: I will not be discussing my private life with you\n\nVS\n\nColleague: hey OP what did you get down this weekend with your husband?\nOP: my *partner* and I went to the movies\n\nIs scenario 1 REALLY the best one?", "Both suck, the first is worded too abrasively and the second is worded too vaguely that it causes OP to give the perception of tacitly agreeing.\n\nFirst option but I'd say \"I don't feel comfortable talking about this topic\""]}
