OP, I have a feeling she's going to brag to the other siblings about how generous your husband is ... and the rest will visit with the same expectations.  She's crossed so many boundaries and using him/you.  I'd make a quick trip to the Dollar Store & purchase toiletries for her (toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, hairbrush, makeup and more).  Put them in a nice giftbag from there & act so happy that you are giving her these items.  You just WANTED her to have her own toiletries!  WHY is it your/hubby's problem if she didn't arrange for an international phone plan - that is HER issue.  Hopefully, she will leave soon; otherwise, time to divey up chores:  grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, laundry.   Congratulations about your baby.", "NTA but take a deep breath.  It's hard even as a spouse to get in the middle of your spouse's \"family dynamics\" and it's often a losing battle.  You are right to be annoyed for sure, but she'll likely be flying home very soon and it's probably gonna be easier for your mental sanity to not fight about it", "NAH because I don't think anyone has bad intentions, but this might be a cultural difference. \n\nI life in a HCOL area in a European country and can get a nice dinner f0r 15-20\u20ac. 75\u20ac per person is what I spend on date nights at a restaurant with a Michelin star. There's simply no way a student can afford these prices. \n\nI would also never expect anyone from my family who's younger than me, let alone a student, to pay for their meals or other expenses while I'm hosting them. She's not travelling through the country and asking if she can sleep over, she's visiting you guys. In my experience, that means you handle the accommodation and she handles the travelling cost. With your husband already paying half of those, I think the implication that he'd pay for other expenses too was implied.", "I'm going with NAH, sounds like you and your husband just need to communicate better about plans and expectations.", "This should all have been clearly decided before SIL traveled. It sounds like she had one set of expectations for the trip and you had another. NAH, but next time communicate before the trip is planned.", "It\u2019s his sister, and if there\u2019s no financial strain in accommodating her financially for this trip then your husband has every right to do so. (Meaning it won\u2019t impact your ability to pay bills etc.) Soft YTA, because pregnancy hormones are no joke, and your entitled to feel annoyed by the situation. \n\nYou don\u2019t know her financial situation, (it could be strained)and her brother is happy to pay for her so I don\u2019t see the problem. SIL communicated she thought money would come through for the trip that didn\u2019t in the anticipated timeline.\n\nYou\u2019re not wrong for feeling frustrated she hasn\u2019t offered to pay you guys back for these accommodations. Ultimately though your husband wants to do this for his sister and I think it\u2019s awesome that they have a close relationship with each other like that. If she was someone who consistently used him financially I doubt he\u2019d be so laid back about the situation.", "NTA. Who doesn't bring basic hygiene products on a trip. She should have disclosed that she didn't have funds to pay to travel. Good luck with your baby OP. Hope you don't stress too much!", "It's the complete lack of preparation on her part that makes her an asshole in my eyes - if I went to visit family 50 miles away overnight, I'd take a comb, toothbrush and deodorant etc, so the fact she didn't bother doing so for an international trek is plain weird - it signals an *intent* to freeload.\n\nNTA.", "This is probably a combination of culture clash, being a student, and possibly some miscommunication between her and your husband\n\nNTA, but I think you're being a little harsh", "Yes, YTA.   It's your husband's family, if he doesn't mind treating and you all can afford it, then that's the end of that.", "NTA. Being annoyed is valid. Doing something about being annoyed, without talking to your husband, would have been the asshole move.\n\nMaybe you can continue the conversation with your husband as time goes on. The fact is, so long as he's willing, able, and happy to support her during her stay, in a way that doesn't harm you, then there isn't really a problem. The way you describe it does make her seem childish, which is unfortunate for her, but it isn't your problem to solve.", "NTA.  Not much you can do this trip except send her on her way, if you're not feeling good or something./s\n\nBut, next visit, lay it all out.  Don't assume anything because...you know.", "YTA.  He's allowed to spend money on his family.  Don't get crappy with him over what is, in the end, a small amount of money.  Don't cause a fight over a $12 plate of food and a $2 toothbrush. \n\nHe's allowed to spend at his own discretion on his own desires, right?  Especially since he has a job and earns money, right?", "YTA if you husband doesn\u2019t mind paying why does it bother you? I\u2019m assuming he is paying?", "YTA if his family has an internal culture of being openhanded with each other.", "Since your husband wants to do it, he should be allowed to do so.", "NTA,... but not worth making a mountain out of a mole hill. if she visits again in the future, have a talk about what she needs to bring. Im guessing she is bummed not having cash as well.", "NTA\n\nI suspect that maybe in conversations with your husband lead her to expect everything would be taken care of. Might have even recommended not bringing too much?  If he didn't share that with you it would look like she is taking advantage. I would also suspect that the pregnancy has you very sensitive right now. I'm surprised your husband had her visit when you are at eight months.  Its a rough time to make you entertain.", "NTA I would be pissed that my husband let his family stay at our house. That\u2019s what hotels are for!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I feel kind of sorry for her, she doesn\u2019t seem to have anything.  I understand your frustration, but if this money won\u2019t set you back, I wouldn\u2019t worry about it.  It\u2019s not worth it.  And if your husband is okay with it, I don\u2019t know what you could do\u2014she is his sister.  \n\nYou are right to be annoyed, but I\u2019d try to let this go.

Who doesn't lend things like toothpaste? And more so, it's your husband that invited her and he's cool with it. If anything you should be mad at your husband, not the sister.", "But what kind of sense does it make to be okay with splitting the cost of an intercontinental flight, but not being ok sharing a few servings of toothpaste? Sounds like OP is more annoyed with her visiting in the first place rather than the lack of planning.", "I agree with NAH and that there might be some sort of cultural or familial difference at play. I\u2019ve definitely known families where it would just be taken for granted that a big brother would treat his younger sister if she came to visit. But if that\u2019s not your experience, it would look reallly entitled when the younger sister doesn\u2019t even reach for her wallet.", "I agree with this.", "Who says she didn't disclose this?", "We live in a HCOL area, so meals out are in the $50-75 per person range.

At 25, I was more than capable of packing sufficient clothing and toiletries for any trip I chose to take.

I suspect, hear me out, that he values time spent with his sister who lives an ocean away more than he values some money.", "There must be places to dine where that cost could cover all 3 of your meals right?
