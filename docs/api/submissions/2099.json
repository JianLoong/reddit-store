By \"have,\" she means sharing the straw, which I have told her multiple times I don't like to do (esp. because I just got sick). I politely decline, and she gives me these puppy dog eyes. Multiple times I make eye contact with her looking at my drink.\n\nLuckily, a classmate bails me out and tells Mia that she can use her $5. Mia is the type of person to ask everyone around her for money but never really bring any money to these boba fundraisers. I have bought her boba before (just as an FYI). However, by the time Mia makes it downstairs, they have already run out of the flavor she wants. She then comes upstairs and asks again if I can share her boba with her. I decline again.\n\nNow here's where I might be TA:\n\nI go outside to practice my debate as it is a quiet place. By the time I come back, I'm very cold and don't feel like drinking the tea anymore. I have about 1/3 of the drink left, counting ice cubes. I notice that Lucy feels a little down and was looking at my drink. I've never bought her anything before and she doesn't really like asking people for food because Mia usually overshadows her. I ask her if she wants the rest. Her face immediately brightens up and accepts happily.\n\nUpon seeing this, Mia immediately expresses her discontent and basically tells me off in the middle of the classroom, leaving me stunned. She then didn't talk to me for the next day, leaving a sort of weird tension in the debate room. \n\nI asked some mutuals of what they thought about the situation. Some said I was TA because I didn't share my drink when Mia asked first.

It's your drink, you paid it with your money, and saying no is no. Your friend could have bought something else, and it's not your fault that they run out of that specific flavor. Hope you enjoyed your drink! \ud83d\ude17", "NTA because it was your drink to give to whoever you want, and you gave it to someone to brighten their day which is a kindness, and Mia sounds like an entitled mooch who doesn't really deserve it anyway. That said, the fallout was rather predictable. You knew Mia wanted the drink, and you gave it to someone else right in front of her. Did you think she wouldn't notice or care?  You would have been better off dumping it when no one was looking, then treating Lucy some other time.", "NTA.  Mia likes to trample boundaries. You had to say no twice.  Even just that alone makes  it better to give Lucy the drink", "NTA. You paid for it. You could have thrown it away or given it to the class bully bc it\u2019s your and you can decide what happens to it. With that said Mia wanted to share your drink Aka: drink some and give it back. This is how germs are shared (viruses and bacteria). High school students usually share viruses like mono not bc of kissing but...bc of sharing drinks. Fever blisters can be transferred this way as can strep throat, flu, covid, colds and other illnesses. You have a wonderful policy...never drink after someone. The difference is you offered Lucy the drink AFTER you were finished.", "NTA - It\u2019s your drink. You can do with it what you want. You could\u2019ve poured the rest down the drain\u2026that\u2019s your prerogative because you own that thing. No one is more entitled to it than anyone else just because they asked first. You can say no to one person and yes to another.", "NTA, and Mia has the audacity, holy shit... why is she so entitled? She can go get her own.", "NTA, she's not entitled to your drinks nor to other people buying her drinks, very obnoxious brat reaction to not getting what she wanted and had zero right to", "OK. This would be fine for someone else. But, I draw the line at any potential backwashing and absolutely no sharing of straws. I'm just weird like that. So, NTA. I'd rather give my friend a cup and pour half into it for her than share a straw. Ewwwwwwwwww. Give me The Shivers.\n\nNTA \ud83d\ude02 In case I wasn't clear - it was the sharing the straw thing that seemed the greater issue to me not the money.", "NTA I am in agreement with you about sharing drinks/ utensils. It is gross, especially when you consider backwash.\n\nAs for your drink Mia can ask 50 times and  you can say no. If you want to give it to Lucy that is fine too. It is your drink and you can do what you want with it. Life isn't always fair and now is a good time for Mia to learn that.\n\nI wouldn't want to give my drink to someone who is habitually a mooch. Don't reward bad behavior. Lucy at least wasn't a pest about it. Nobody is entitled to your drink.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She started to today, painfully. The world doesn't revolve around them. They're definitely the asshole.", "NTA. It\u2019s you\u2019re drink and Mia is a pain.", "So......you were concerned about sharing your germs with Mia, but Lucy could buck up and handle any illness you might be passing on?  LOL\n\nIn the waves following the pandemic, I'd be more concerned with the foolish ideas of anyone sharing straws and drinks.  Backwash always ends up in even the most yummy flavors of Boba!", "NTA.\n\nYou paid for it. It was yours to do what you wanted with it.", "YTA\n\nRefusing to give Mia your drink was completely fair, and needs no justification.\n\nRefusing to give Mia and of your drink, but then offering the remainder to Lucy was an asshole move - you are purposely choosing favourites and picking sides in telling Mia that you want to give something to Lucy **but not her**.\n\nEspecially if you made a point of justifying yourself by saying things like 'I don't want to share germs' which you then ignored by giving them to Lucy anyway.", "Hot take but I think YTA. Obviously, you can do whatever you want with something you bought. That's not my problem[p](https://problem.My). My problem is that you didn't predict this outcome. If Mia was asking constantly, then intentionally giving your drink to someone else definitely would come off as a bit of a middle finger to her. I do agree with most people that she doesn't deserve your drink and that she should learn that life isn't fair, but I also think you did something that was obviously going to come off as petty/provoke a reaction.", "NTA in high school I had a friend like that \u2014 always wanting a sip or a bite out of people\u2019s food. It was farking annoying until I realized that she never had money for food. She couldn\u2019t even afford a can of soda. I still let her have a bite of my food, but my parents were not rich and I couldn\u2019t afford to keep buying her lunch everyday. She used to mooch off of people for lunch and during breaks.", "Thank you for this. My friend told me something similar. I didn't intentionally mean to hurt Mia, and I'll try to do better in the future.", "With her own personal straw. Uh un.", "Right?!!  Especially since OP mentions they recently were sick!!  I agree the whole idea sharing drinks and straws and backwash chunks is gross!", "I asked her if she wanted it. If she didn't want it, I would've thrown it away. But both of them are the type of person to not balk about sharing straws/forks etc, so Mia was happy to have it. However, I didn't give Mia my drink because I'd drinking AGAIN from the same straw afterwards. Hope that clears things up! :)", "I understand your opinion, and I agree with it. I definitely wasn't trying to provoke her but I thought it would be okay since I bought her a drink before, and in total it wasn't that much left in the cup: maybe 3-4 sips. But I do get where you're coming from.", "Not at all!  You said you'd been sick, so the concern should have been passing your sickness cooties on to your friends.  But instead, you didn't want to drink from the same straw as Mia because you didn't want to catch her cooties.  Either way, it's a gross and unsanitary thing to do.....everything from cold sores to all sorts of serious illness and disease can get passed along.", "All in all I think, originally, Mia is TA but that's not an option lol"]}
