And if all that was available were seats at the front of the theatre, it was on them to buy tickets for another time if they did not want to sit there. You are right. The whole point of buying tickets online and reserving your seats is so you do not have to get there early to claim seats. That\u2019s why most movie theaters do reserved seating these days!", "NTA.

I have an almost 3 year old and I still wouldn't even bring her to a kid's movie at a theater because she has the attention span of a flea and, again, she's a kid so she gets loud and active when she's bored.

A baby isn't a get out of jail card. You shouldn't just think you can get away with anything because you have kid with you, much less in an adult environment that isn't suited to a young child.

Kids or no kids.", "Nta. Most theaters make you pick which seats you sit at even if you don't buy them online.

The mom kept asking how we knew these were our seats. We like, because these are our tickets and they align with the seats you\u2019re sitting in. I was about to lose it on the woman when she let out a loud sigh, rolled her eyes, and told her girls they had to move. I didn\u2019t care she was with her children. I had seen the cartoon version on my 7th birthday in the theater and before my sister moved to another state it was the movie we watched together.", "And some people like the option of choosing seats ahead of time without coming early.\n\nYour personal preferences do not negate those of other people."]}
