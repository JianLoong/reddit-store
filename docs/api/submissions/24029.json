She\u2019s the asshole and -1 for the parenting", "Absolutely  NTA.  The purpose of reserved seating is to eliminate scrambling for seats. And no way would the presence of a baby deter me. The kid was carried anyway, so moving made no difference to him.", "NTA.", "NTA.  Just because they have a baby doesn't give them a pass to be jerks.  Having a baby doesn't make you a good person, just means you have a baby.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nDude what you did was very justified. It was yours and your husband's seats, you paid for that sh\\*t . The parents are THE  a\\*\\*holes because they brought their child to an R rated movie (sure their child wouldn't understand the film, but it is still inappropriate) and didn't even sat on the seats they paid for. And also the other movie goers are an a\\*\\* for siding with the parents, it's almost like they are tolerating bad behavior. GOOD JOB FOR STANDING UP FOR YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND!!", "NTA. this horrible mother. She'd be the type to try to sit in 1st class, despite having paid for economy and expecting the first class passenger to sit in economy \"because its MEEE...everything is about Meeeee. for I am the center of the universe\"", "NTA Tell your husband to stop being a people pleaser. Someone tried to do this with my front row Tay Tay seats. It\u2019s people like your husband who make seat stealers believe that they will get away with it.", "NTA at all! You paid for and reserved them, the audacity of that family", "NTA abso-freaking-lutely not! Why would you go another time! NO!", "somebody give a reward right now", "If it's advertised as a mums and babies session, you knos what you're in for.", "Why tf would you care?", "I didn't even know that was a thing.\n\nI worked at a movie theater when I was a teenager and we would have never let parents watch a movie with their baby.   \nAs a mother of three, this would have never even crossed my mind. I would be seriously pissed off, if I got a sitter for my kids, so I could go watch a movie with my husband, just to be seated next to a fussy infant.\n\nEither get a sitter or stay at home and watch a DVD..."]}
