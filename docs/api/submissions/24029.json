And you know these types of parents wouldn't take the baby out of the theater to calm it, thus ruining everyone else's experience. The last baby I saw in a theater was at a 10pm showing of A Quiet Place and it screamed until an employee made the family leave...25 minutes in.", "I can\u2019t imagine taking my baby to a movie, especially one intended for adults. Loud noises and a bright screen sound like a nightmare for an infant. My baby would scream the whole time. Their poor little ears.", "NTA. We made someone move last week who was in our seats. No argument at all. That\u2019s the whole point of purchasing tickets in advance.", "Assholes, that\u2019s who.", "Seat selection system is the best thing to happen to movies since color filming.", "It was supposed to say \u201cHe feels bad for making a family with a young child move.\u201d I didn\u2019t realize I missed a few words lol", "Why tf would you go see the the little mermaid?", "To offer some perspective on early familial seating, parents clearing the aisles of children and all the accoutrements speeds things up considerably. \n\nI fly internationally frequently and have been on planes where that isn\u2019t done (or the families are late) and it can become a bottleneck.  Everyone else has the allowable items to deal with, but parents have an extra person and double the items at least.", "Bringing a baby to an R rated movie had already proven them to being selfish and inconsiderate before stealing someone else\u2019s seats.", "Please keep boarding early, it means I can keep sitting comfortably waiting for my boarding group instead of standing in line while y\u2019all get situated. Seriously, the plane takes off at the same regardless of when you board, you\u2019re good going first with boarding to make things go more smoothly.", "Why not? It was a fantastic movie.", "I love how they were the bad guys for \u201cmaking the baby move\u201d as if the baby was going to be actively watching and comprehending the (inappropriate) movie anyway", "> But most of those can be accommodated by getting there early.\n\nSee, the likely reason that reserved seating started was to avoid this. I just looked up one my local multi plexes and they have films starting at 8:10, 8:15. 8:20, 8:30, 8:40, 9:10, 9:15, and 9:40. The concession line is bad enough, we don't need to stack up the entrance line, too.", ">I like having the option to move to an empty seat in the theatre that suits me better.\n\nTough for you.\n\nGo to a theater without seating purchases and solve your own problem.", "Maybe it\u2019s more of an issue in bigger places.\n\nI live in a small Canadian city and assigned seating only started during COVID. After you bought your seats they would block out seats around yours as \u2018not for sale\u2019 so that they could enforce social distancing. That no longer happens.  \n\nWe just buy our tickets at the concession so it doesn\u2019t really affect lineups either. \n\nI\u2019ve just noticed a few posts like this lately and most say that the theatre didn\u2019t enforce the assigned seats and they ended up sitting in the front row or had to sit separately so I figured getting rid of assigned seating might fix the problem.  I was wrong based on the downvotes.  \ud83d\ude01", "I could see how if it were only one or two screens, there probably isn't much of a problem. The theater I favor has, I think 5 screens, but there are others around me with 14, 16. That has to get crazy at prime movie time, the 7 - 9 start times.\n\nBefore assigned seating, I absolutely was the get there early type. I loved the first row of the upper tier, had a rail in front of me instead of other seats. Half my popcorn would be gone by the time the movie started and it really increased the odds that I had to pee before it was over. I really appreciate the assigned seating."]}
