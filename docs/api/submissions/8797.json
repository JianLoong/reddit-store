It costs you nothing since you know she'll decline. And each time she turns you down, note it on your calendar along with the reason she gave you for now going.\n\nAnd each time you agree to stay home with her, also note it down in your calendar along with the time you spent etc.\n\nThis way the next time she complains, you can tell her exactly how many times you proposed and she declined and how many times you went to bed later than anticipated because of her.\n\nHelping her with her mental health is good but don't neglect yours. Push back when she's being too demanding. If you have facts on hand it will be easier to argue that you're already doing all that you can do.\n\nNTA.", "Nta.
