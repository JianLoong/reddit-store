You're ready to write off your family as \"permanently destroyed\" for this? This tells me your husband is being way too controlling, and that your daughter's destination wedding probably has as much to do with finally drawing a boundary as it does any pretty scenery far away. Once those kind of threats are on the table, yeah, YTA. \n\nAn alternative: Don't fund, but attend, the destination wedding, then throw a local party for family and friends.

It was super great of you to support your FSIL as well, but that doesn't mean you get to try to force them to do it the way you want.\n\nEdit: OP responded to this comment with what I believe to be her real account and said:\n\n\"He's refusing to go because there is no way other family can go. My mother can't travel 45 minutes locally, let alone fly to Florida.... Not to mention she has limited mobility. His brother has health issues that prevent him from traveling. My 97yo uncle can't go because travel is hard. We aren't young either.\n\nIt wasn't \"my job\" to cover $400k+ in expenses she incurred as AN ADULT. I don't know too many people funding 3 degrees at private schools, international travel and education, home purchases, home repairs, and 3 years of mortgage payments. \n\nY t a... not me\"\n\nIn response to that, here's what I have to say:\n\nIronically, nothing you said here is going to sound impressive to me because my mom did nearly all of that for me as well. She paid for my college, she paid for me to travel with my fiance, she helped me buy real estate, and she's going to help me through my doctorate. Now, my family is very wealthy and some would consider me a trust fund baby, so I know that this isn't the case for everyone, but if you can provide that for your child, what excuse do you have as a parent not to? Just because you're legal obligation to them ends, they're still your child. This isn't a transactional relationship where she owes you now because of what you've done for her.\n\nEven more so if you never did any of that with any kind of stipulation, which I suspect you didn't. I'm guessing you probably just paid for things and never actually said anything else. \n\nAlso, if you're in the US, \"Florida\" is not a \"destination wedding\". Sure, it's a destination, but the barrier to travel is so much lower to go to Florida of all places. I understand that you want your family to come, and your family is very important to you, but that family should also include your daughter, for whom this is clearly very important.\n\nEven more so than before, YTA.", "YTA\u2014 **THIS IS HER WEDDING. NOT YOU OR YOUR HUSBAND\u2019S WEDDING.** You basically ruined her wedding with you & especially your husband\u2019s selfish demeanor. What kind of father goes no contact with his daughter over where she has her wedding? This is one of the most important moments in her life & he wants to take the reigns & have her do as he pleases while holding the threat of destroying the family over her head? She should have her destination wedding with close friends & go no contact with you & your husband because you really seem like two self centered individuals.", "YTA, if you're willing to go low or no contact with your kid because they don't want to have the wedding that you want them to have, that says a lot more about you than them.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She thinks this is no big deal because there are only a few family members she wants to invite, everyone gets a forced vacation, and it's what they want to do. She also has this dream that it is a way to force her dad to take a nice vacation (we haven't been on a vacation in years.... pre 2005). \n\nSIL-to-be likes the idea, doesn't like the idea of a big elaborate wedding, and only cares that daughter is happy.\n\nMy husband and I are willing to pay for a local wedding at a nice venue so family can attend. (I do not want a freebie backyard wedding... not trying to cheap out here and definitely don't want to do the work). We don't want some big over-the-top spectacle any more than the couple do.\n\nWhen I've tried to explain this plan excludes pretty much everyone, including her dad, her answer is that \"it's about our wedding, and what I want, not other people.  Am I so wrong to expect my parents to support me?\"\n\nMy husband is dead set against a destination wedding. He views this as disrespectful to family.  Air travel and expense would exclude most family. We have elderly people who can't travel, young adults and people with kids who can't afford to travel, and nobody trustworthy to watch our pets. He's furious that wants to do this and has said he will not attend.  I believe that.\n\nI could be ok with destination idea, but not if my husband refuses to go.  I feel it is entitled, selfish, and unreasonable to refuse to compromise given the generous and unquestioning financial support we have provided to both of them and our willingness to pay for a local wedding.   We've done everything for them.  It's not like she can't do a destination party separately.  \n\nIt's worth noting that my husband and I have supported her exceptionally generously, in every way throughout the last 30+ years and through 9 years of education; we have supported SIL as well.\n\nMy bet is, if she goes ahead with a destination wedding, hubs will be permanently pissed and LC/NC, permanently destroying our family.  Since he won't go, that leaves me solo, which would be lonely, embarrassing, and miserable as well as cause a rift in my marriage.\n\nMy daughter says this hurts her because it is supposed to be about her marriage, not what we want or other people. She says she is no longer interested in a wedding because she can't have the destination wedding she wants.\n\nSo AweTAs for not supporting a destination wedding? Are we AHs for expecting compromise?\n\nReminder, we offered to pay for a local wedding at a nice venue that would be easy for everyone to attend and there is nothing to prevent her from having a friends' party at her desired destination.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You shouldn't do that, but you do have bodily autonomy over whether you'll attend someone else's party. And nobody should go L/NC over how an adult child gets married! If you wouldn't do that if they eloped (again, you said downthread that you'd like them to elope), then don't do it if they do a destination wedding that you don't want to attend. Also, they don't owe grandparents or anyone else a local, accessible wedding. Those other relatives, too, can still love them if their wedding isn't it town and they don't want to go. Good grief.\n\nIf you're too rich to claim poverty as a reason for not giving her any money for the wedding, and it does come across that way, then be gracious, smooth over everybody's ruffled feathers, give her a gift of wedding money and then let them do what they want.

We didn't do any of the bullshit MC theatrics that nobody likes to sit through during a wedding unless you're really close to the bride and groom.  We had a ceremony, then a reception, and the reception was nothing more than a free dinner, open bar, music and dancing.  We did have speeches from both sides' parents, and best man/maid of honor, but generally asked to keep it short, being mindful of those \"fringe\" guests (coworkers, less close friends) that sit in the back and don't know what anyone is talking about and we've both been there and it's boring as fuck.", "NTA, I just find it interesting that the daughter gave up on her wedding plan as soon as she got a little push back.

You don't have to pick the place, you just show up and bam you're traveling!!", "She also messed up and posted under her real account lol", "Yep! Which I don't really think the daughter was trying to do here. Especially when you consider it sounds like OPs husband doesn't want to attend simply because he hates to travel.", "In the end anything the daughter says pales in comparison to the fact that OP is convinced her husband will go no contact if his daughter dares to get married anywhere not local. And OP, instead of calling her husband out on his bs expects her daughter to change everything for her. \n\nSomeone made a point that maybe the daughter just wants to go somewhere with her dad for once. 2005? That is ridiculous. Especially because it sounds like money isn't the problem. He just doesn't want to go. Not sure if they are in the US but OP commented that he won't go anywhere, not an island or to Florida. Sounds like the daughter is trying hard to compromise and mom and dads response is \"here or nowhere\". \n\nAnd the mom won't go because \"it'll drive a wedge in my marriage\" and \"I'll have to ask him to watch our pets\". Like...OP is in an abusive relationship and doesn't even know it. Imagine the life the daughter had growing up if dad will go no contact over something this dumb and mom is essentially okay with it. She even said that she will expect \"consequences\" for her daughter. This woman is insane. And did you see her defence for why it's okay for him to react this way? It's because \"family is the most important thing to him\". Lol. \n\nOP is picking her husband over her daughter and I doubt it's anything new. I feel so bad for her. I bet she figured this is the one chance I have to get my dad to go somewhere and now neither of them will go \"on principle\" as OP put it.\n\nEdit for the person who commented: \n\nI couldn't comment before OP deleted their entire account. The daughter is just as bad as the father? A father threatening to go NC over a wedding!? Insane. He also could go. They have nothing stopping them. He's choosing not to, that is her issue.", "If you want people to chose your wedding over feeding their families, well\u2026 that says exactly what kind of person you are. Enjoy.", ">Reminder, we offered to pay for a local wedding at a nice venue that would be easy for everyone to attend and there is nothing to prevent her from having a friends' party at her desired destination.\r  \n\r\n\nA compromise was offered. It was turned down. I'm not sure where the confusion is. She's making plans that aren't working for the bride's father. She's doing this to \"force\" the father to take a vacation. He doesn't want to.", "RIGHT!  I went to the judge with my first marriage.  I have no interest in a wedding. But, if my partner tried to pull this, I'd be \"ok, I'll see you when we get back\". He knows it too.", "THIS is what so many parents are like now. YOU choose to have a child then you are taking on the responsibility of their physical and mental care until they are at least 18, they do not owe you for that, children don't deserve to be punished for their parents choices.", "1) daughter was 13 the last time they went on vacation. That's not 20-30. It's never a \"duty\", but if you love and enjoy your kids then who doesn't want to spend a few days with them, relaxing? \n\n2) it seems like the daughter just wants dad to _join_ her on holiday, she doesn't expect him to pay for it.", "Yes that\u2019s exactly what I mean!! Good for you - I hope your wedding is fantastic! We chose to have a big local wedding but are forced to invite numerous of my fianc\u00e9s aunts/uncles/cousins to keep the peace. His parents don\u2019t talk to them and my fianc\u00e9 literally doesn\u2019t know their names!!! Wedding planning is dumb. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re avoiding that.", "With a limited budget and limited vacation days I would prefer to travel where I choose from my own bucket list, not someone else's", "Good grief, it\u2019s an invitation, not a legal summons", "Do you play basketball with that kind of reach", "That's not what a compromise is", "Thank you! We are so excited for it, and for the fact it includes a vacation (something the parents in this post are obviously angry about but all of our guests are stoked!!). \nOh I hear ya, wedding planning truly brings out the worst in some people and really shows how selfish and demanding they can be, and I have no idea why! I hope your wedding was amazing in spite of those annoyances", "Different strokes for different folks. It's my never ending goal to work from home not from home in as many not-home places as possible.", "This comment needs more likes. People acting like they are obligated to attend.", "It is exactly what a compromise is.\n\n>the acceptance of standards that are lower than is desirable.\r\n\nYou're more than welcome to explain yourself instead of making single statements without any substance.", "Thank you :) I\u2019m still very excited despite it all so I can\u2019t complain too much!", "That's a beautifully privileged life you lead. Not possible for most.", "No that's just getting what op and her husband wants and absolutely ignoring the daughters wants", "Which brings us back to this statement.\n\n>He views this as disrespectful to family. Air travel and expense would exclude most family. We have elderly people who can't travel, young adults and people with kids who can't afford to travel, and nobody trustworthy to watch our pets.\n\nThey're not ignoring what the daughters WANT. The daughter is ignoring what everybody else NEEDS. Which for whatever reason, the husband is against.\n\nThe daughter can still have her destination wedding. They're not denying her of it. They just won't be able to attend it and would prefer a local wedding instead.\n\nEdit: Lmao dude deleted his account or got banned. His last reply said \"What they need doesn't matter\".\n\nYeah OK I don't know what kind of dream world you live in but other people have lives to live. What each individual person needs do matter and should be taken into account when making plans.", "What they need doesn't matter.", "Her dads literally saying he will go NC with her if she has a destination wedding no where does it say she\u2019s demanding her family come she\u2019s fine if people dont", "What does it matter what other people need? Nobody NEEDS to be at a wedding except for the couple and the officiant. She knows that all those random relatives won\u2019t go\u2014that seems like a feature, not a bug, for her. \n\nAnd the dad is threatening to cut her off because of this decision. That\u2019s way more than just choosing not to go."]}
