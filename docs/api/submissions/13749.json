There was no hugging, snuggling or anything of the sort. So when I met my wife and saw her three kids love on her so much, it did make me incredibly uncomfortable. BUT that was a me issue and I just checked myself in to therapy and worked through it. Now the kids are like this with me and sometimes it's still hard but it doesn't make me nearly as uncomfortable as it did. However, my wife is fully aware of this because through therapy I was taught ways to communicate these things to her. So I never asked the kids to stop and never tried forcing my opinions but I did communicate WHY I became so weird about it. So she knows.\n\nAnyways, fast forward to now.. my step kids are currently 13, 11 and 7. All of them are still very much so snuggly kids and easily wrap my wife up on the couch 4 times a day. The ONLY issue I currently have is that my wife is currently pregnant. High risk. They have her on bed rest and she's only 16 weeks. I simply do not like how rough the kids seem to be with her. Though they might not actually be super rough but it seems like it to me and I'm worried about my wife and my unborn child. Like my 7yo step son will still lay on his mother's chest (granted he also is a small kid and has some ailments: ASD and ODD). I don't want him laying on his mother's chest. Or the two older ones will lay beside her but like.. half on her. I don't want them doing this either because their legs/half of their torso is on top of their mothers stomach and again, she's high risk. I don't want them unintentionally hurting her. So whenever I see it now, I either tell them to stop or constantly remind them to be careful of their mothers stomach. \n\nMy wife flipped yesterday. She never snaps but she absolutely did this time and told me quite bluntly to \"shut my fucking mouth\" because if my attitude makes it so her kids stop snuggling her, she will never forgive me. Insists she is fine and if she wasn't she would say something. It's been tense here.

Your wife is pregnant, she isn\u2019t a porcelain doll to be placed on a shelf. It is not ok to tell her she can\u2019t cuddle with her kids.", "YTA, it\u2019s best you stay in therapy because your issues are unresolved. You\u2019re projecting your upbringing onto your wife and step kids and it\u2019s not healthy. They have a healthy, loving relationship. Embrace it don\u2019t discourage it.", "YTA: Dude, I get that you're stressed about your wife's pregnancy, but nobody ever had a miscarriage from their kids curling up next to them on the sofa. Nothing you've described here sounds \"rough\" in the slightest. Your old discomfort with the family's cuddly ways has seized your anxiety as a mask. Trust your wife's judgment.", "YTA, and part of me wonders if there may be any particular reason why you would be more concerned about this kid than you are about your stepkids. Your wife is an adult, and the kids aren\u2019t made of lead; they\u2019re not crushing or injuring her or the baby in any way. In fact, having them close during a high-risk pregnancy is probably helping her stay calm and comfortable.", "I get that this is making you uncomfortable, but you're the AH. \n\nThere's not many years that kids want to cuddle with their parents (I'm sorry yours were so unavailable emotionally), but I would also be livid if my partner told my son to stop cuddling me. \n\nI'm also going through a high-risk pregnancy, and I guarantee my son sitting on me isn't going to cause a miscarriage. \n\nKeep going to your therapist, have a talk with your wife about your worries, but understand that she will decide how much cuddling she can deal with.", "Why don\u2019t you think a woman who\u2019s already given birth to and raised three kids would know her own limits in relation to her pregnancy?", "My dude, YTA, she is right, you are wrong. You have not 'worked through your issues\" and you are on track to favor one kid over the others. Take some time to reflect.", "Yta", "YTA. If you're like this now what will you be like once the babies out and they want cuddles with it?! I can assure you that if you're wife's comfortable it's fine. You need to get over this well before baby arrives.", "YTA. Your wife likes to be physically affectionate. A kid laying on her chest or draping on her will not harm the unborn. You need to have a conversation with the doctor or midwife on what is \"rough\" and what is you overreacting", "YTA. \n\nIsnt is so interesting how fully grown adults have the ability to speak if they are concerned about something that is happening to *their own body*.", "YTA. Your concern is entirely misplaced.", "YTA\nYour wife can speak for herself. Also this is hard for the kids, their mum not being able to care for them.", "If your wife has a problem she can voice it, and she doesnt 2 of those kids are getting at an age where the snuggling will become less and less and seeing your wife's reaction she knows it and wants to get as much as she can get before it becomes reare", "YTA. Pretty sure she can tell something they are doing will harm her or the baby.", "Yta\n\nYour wife has done this before and has autonomy over her own body. If she felt the kids were being too rough she would say something. \n\nYou are very much forcing your lack of familial bonding with your family onto her and her children. She has a very normal and healthy bond and relationship with her children and definitely doesn't need you to put boundaries in place that she hasn't asked for.\n\nPlease resolve your issues before your wife gives birth because her mama bear instincts will step up more and these are the kinds of things that can break a relationship.", "YTA.  This is a mother and her children, I get that maybe you'll never understand that bond, but you've got to stop trying to drive this wedge of your neuroses between them.  There's no danger in what they're doing, there's nothing wrong with what they're doing, and all you're going to do is alienate your family from you.  Stop it.", "YTA. Your wife can speak for herself", "YTA\n\nYour wife has been quite clear. You're treating her like an object.", "A little bit YTA. Talk to the doctor about your concerns to put your mind at ease, keep talking to your therapist, and tell your wife you're sorry. She's likely under a lot of stress right now, too. Bedrest isn't easy.", "You are anxious about your wife right now and seeing the kids with her seems risky to you. \n\nIt\u2019s not, though. High risk and bed rest is not related to stomach snuggling. \n\nYour wife may actually be comforted by the contact, so trying to limit contact to make your feelings easier could make hers more difficult. \n\nYou have to listen to her and let her be in charge of her own body. \n\nI understand that your intentions are coming from concern, but still, YTA.", "Yta. You are soooo much ta", "She's made her wishes for her own body known, so YWBTA if you continue.", "YTA - give your wife some agency", "YTA and I actually feel sorry for you. \n\nYou are obviously incredibly uncomfortable with physical displays of affection. To the point where you are somehow making it seem dangerous for your step children to cuddle their mum?! \n\nMy kids are these ages. We snuggle a lot. It\u2019s glorious. Everyone is certain of the love they have for one another. My kids know without a doubt that I am their safe place. \n\nThis interaction is precious. It has a limit. Kids become older and no longer want this contact (or at least to a lesser degree). Your wife knows this. She\u2019s rightly treasuring these moments and is ensuring they continue as long as possible. You are threatening this. \n\nRest assured your wife will dump you in a heartbeat if you continue to threaten this dynamic. Get your shit together or risk being kicked out of this lovely family.", "YTA. It's coming from concern, but it's unreasonable. \n\n>Insists she is fine and if she wasn't she would say something. It's been tense here. \n\nShe is pregnant for the 4th time and knows what's up. Get back into therapy if you have stopped because the job isn't done.", "Who cares what you want?  Your wife can make her own decisions, regarding her body and her kids. Seriously, grow up and give your head a wobble", "YTA you need to go back to therapy", "YTA. Laying on her chest will not effect the baby inside of her womb. Next time she goes to the OBGYN, ask to tag along and learn what outside actions can and cannot hurt the baby. \n\nAlso remember that she\u2019s not in bed rest because of outside touch. I don\u2019t know the reasoning, but I know that she\u2019s not on bed rest because her kiddos are snuggling with her.", "YTA, and you're not going to be \u00e0 good father.", "So because you weren\u2019t shown physical affection and love you expect her to raise her kids the same. Yeah you definitely need therapy. YTA", "YTA, mind your own business. Just because you are emotionally stunted doesn't mean you can make them like you. I grew up in a very affectionate family, and what she has with her kids is wonderful, and I pity YOUR kid for the relationship you two will have.", "My god YTA. Her kids will always trump you and are her first priority. She knows her limits. Keep going to therapy and working on yourself, you\u2019ve got a long way to go.", "YTA. It's really up to her. Why do you think you know better than your pregnant wife what her body can and can't handle?\n\nThis seems like a you issue again.", "YTA. Cuddles are good, stress is bad. Even more so when you're pregnant. Telling my kids that I'm off limits when I want them there is way, way, WAY worse than a child leaning on me. \n\nPlease, trust dour wife in this.", "YTA. She\u2019s their mother, she knows her limits. Are you upset because you want your wife all to yourself and new baby? She\u2019s high risk, it happens. She\u2019s not gonna break. Are you going to blame the step kids if something happens (heaven forbid). You got issues man. Maybe up the therapy.", "Gunna go with NAH. \n\nI get it, I'm not a snuggler either. But you have to remember this will be her fourth pregnancy, she knows what she's doing and you have to give her that benefit of the doubt. \n\nIf you think the kids are rough now at their ages, she was pregnant at some point with toddlers. I've seen my pregnant friends take cannonballs from their wild toddlers and come out just fine. You didn't mention having any kids yourself so I'm going to assume this is your first pregnancy and a high risk can be scary and you're being overprotective. But she knows what she's doing and you have to trust her.", "Soft YTA. Go back to therapy. This is another you issue. Your wife isnt made of glass and cuddling wont induce a miscarriage.", "NTA, your concern is sweet, but misguided. You should trust her to guide the kids into being gentle, and trust the kids to care for their mother.\n\nPlease understand her perspective of the situation, and try to imagine how she feels. And importantly, apologise to her. You shouldn't have asked this of the kids. And perhaps they deserve an apology as well, it might've made them feel uncomfortable or uncertain", "I don't think that you're an asshole I just think that you're scared which is warranted. But it sounds like your wife is okay so do your best to not stress out.", "Nta. You love your wife and you love your step kids. You are completely overreacting and you need to calm down. They won't have any impact on the baby by laying on her.", "Nta. You love your wife and you love your step kids. You are completely overreacting and you need to calm down.
