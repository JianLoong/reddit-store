There was no hugging, snuggling or anything of the sort. So when I met my wife and saw her three kids love on her so much, it did make me incredibly uncomfortable. BUT that was a me issue and I just checked myself in to therapy and worked through it. Now the kids are like this with me and sometimes it's still hard but it doesn't make me nearly as uncomfortable as it did. However, my wife is fully aware of this because through therapy I was taught ways to communicate these things to her. So I never asked the kids to stop and never tried forcing my opinions but I did communicate WHY I became so weird about it. So she knows.\n\nAnyways, fast forward to now.. my step kids are currently 13, 11 and 7. All of them are still very much so snuggly kids and easily wrap my wife up on the couch 4 times a day. The ONLY issue I currently have is that my wife is currently pregnant. High risk. They have her on bed rest and she's only 16 weeks. I simply do not like how rough the kids seem to be with her. Though they might not actually be super rough but it seems like it to me and I'm worried about my wife and my unborn child. Like my 7yo step son will still lay on his mother's chest (granted he also is a small kid and has some ailments: ASD and ODD). I don't want him laying on his mother's chest. Or the two older ones will lay beside her but like.. half on her. I don't want them doing this either because their legs/half of their torso is on top of their mothers stomach and again, she's high risk. I don't want them unintentionally hurting her. So whenever I see it now, I either tell them to stop or constantly remind them to be careful of their mothers stomach. \n\nMy wife flipped yesterday. She never snaps but she absolutely did this time and told me quite bluntly to \"shut my fucking mouth\" because if my attitude makes it so her kids stop snuggling her, she will never forgive me.

You should trust her to guide the kids into being gentle, and trust the kids to care for their mother.\n\nPlease understand her perspective of the situation, and try to imagine how she feels.

Or not show them affection. Kids are literal and practical. If you say don\u2019t snuggle they won\u2019t really hear the rest because it\u2019s so shocking and take it to mean stop loving on mom. It\u2019ll confuse them and if you say it angry they\u2019ll start to resent you. Then it fucks up their lives and won\u2019t show her love anymore for fear of getting in trouble. Or think they\u2019ve done something wrong. \n\nShe\u2019s had several kids and she knows her body. If they get too much she\u2019ll tell them. \n\nJust be forewarned the newborn will cuddle and breast feed from moms breast so don\u2019t be offended when the little one is literally latched onto her for hours a day. \n\nYou definitely need to overcome your issues. Showing love in a family unit is a good thing. \n\nI understand if you aren\u2019t used to it. I grew up in a home where my parents fought all the time. Always yelling, my dad was a cheater and they fought about that, he\u2019d spend most of his Friday paycheck by Saturday night bar hopping so they fought about that etc etc etc. it was never quiet in my house. \n\nFast forward to meeting my wife when we were dating I\u2019d go to her loving house and so quiet I could her myself think. It was so foreign to me. I\u2019d sit on their back patio in the country and not hear anything but a passing car, birds, cows and just country life in general. Her dad thought I was weird until she told him about my home life then he understood . \n\nI knew that\u2019s how I wanted to live when we married. And we have. For 32 years we\u2019ve lived in peace and quiet and have been a loving touchy feely family. As my daughter grew I gave hugs & kisses and made sure she knew she was loved and never heard us arguing or angry at each other etc. It was an adjustment at first but we\u2019ve made our lives happy and loving. \n\nThat is what your wife & step kids are accustomed to. That\u2019s how they grew up and suddenly you tell them to stay off or leave her be was shocking for them and I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t know why. If I were your wife I\u2019d be mad as hell too. \n\nI understand it\u2019s a high risk pregnancy. I understand the loss of a miscarriage. We lost our first , a son, to miscarriage. It was horrible. So i understand you\u2019re concerned. But you can\u2019t just tell them to leave her be because you\u2019re afraid they\u2019re going to cause issues. But the stress you\u2019re putting on her will cause more trauma than kids loving on her. \n\nJust have a conviction w her and tell her you thought they may hurt her and you\u2019re concerned. \n\nDon\u2019t pull away from them thad be the worse thing you could do. They need to be loved. \n\nAlso when your baby is born you can\u2019t show preferred treatment be one of them is yours and the others aren\u2019t. They\u2019ll pick up on that. Some step kids have been treated differently by the step parent and then took it out on the new baby when they\u2019re older. I\u2019ve seen it personally. He had kids from another marriage and then he & his new wife had a couple of kids together. Their mom passed away & he eventually remarried. When the new kids were starting school age the step kids picked on their new brothers because they saw both parents loved on them equally whereas the step mom never loved on them as she did her kids. They were preteens when they met so she wasn\u2019t able to love on them younger as their mom did so they were jealous of the love of both of them. \n\nSo be sure to include them in everything because they are your family now. You can\u2019t bring your \u201chands off\u201d approach to them because that\u2019s what you were used to. You have to be better for the sake of the entire family.", "How can you even post that without thinking you\u2019re an asshole?? YTA!! Such a fucking asshole. \n\nDo you know that hormones released from snuggling, especially your children, reduces stress and can increase pain threshold? Those snuggles are doing her good\n\nBe very careful that your karma doesn\u2019t come bite you in the ass. Keep on agitating the high risk pregnant lady with your assholiness, and you will likely be the reason something happens to your child.", "YTA\n\nYour wife is her own person, not your property. You behaved in an exceedingly paternalistic manner- acting like you had the authority to make decision on her behalf.\n\n> My wife flipped yesterday. She never snaps but she absolutely did this time and told me quite bluntly to \"shut my fucking mouth\" because if my attitude makes it so her kids stop snuggling her, she will never forgive me. \n\nYou were so wrapped up in what bothered you, you missed something that should have been obvious.\n\nThat your wife finds comfort and connection in this.

OP doesn't want the step kids cuddling their mom in case they damage his bio kid. OP get a grip and actually read up on pregnancy. You didn't explain why she is high risk you just keep repeating it. Further you stressing her out like this is going to cause her more harm in the long run.", "Absolutely YTA. Sounds like you still have some things to work out in therapy. Those are her children and as long as she is fine with how they hang off of her and cuddle her then it really is none of your concern. She is an adult capable of caring for herself and making her own decisions. Also a high risk pregnancy isn\u2019t necessarily going to be affected by the way the kids cuddle with her but the emotional stress of your actions and driving her kids away can have a impact on her health. So my recommendation is get over yourself and keep up working on your issues and leave your stepkids alone.", "YTA\n\nNot only is your wife 100% in the right here, but her kiddo having ODD/ASD makes their cuddling sessions that much more important. She's how that kid regulates themselves. Without cuddles, he's going to be a heck of a lot worse.\n\nThe path you're on leads to divorce jsyk. You need more therapy & more empathy.

Your narrative of \"causing harm\" is transparent, it's blatant you think this is an opportunity to finally impose your will and separate your wife from her babies.\n\nBit of advice, she may seem pretty happy and easygoing, but try and come between her and her love for her babies and you'll face an unholy terror the likes you've never imagined. Hope she bites your head off.", "Dude YTA. You couldn\u2019t make your dislike of your step kids any more obvious, and I can\u2019t even imagine how you\u2019re going to treat them once their sibling is here.

Your poor step kids and future kid.", "I am pregnant.  My 4 year old girl is a bit high energy.  She is tall and thin and has the coordination of a new born giraffe. She is very sweet just a bit amped up and not coordinated at all. \n\nMy partner is not my 4 year olds father. My partner has come to me privately to voice his concerns about 4 year old not being easy with my stomach. I can respect that and tell my 4 year old everytime she comes near to be easy and brace my stomach with my hands. She is trying to be more gentle but she is 4 and I will never turn down a cuddle. \n\nBut if he ever said some rude mouthy shit to my kid about cuddling with her mom I'd be outraged. \n\nThe kids are trying to be affectionate with their parent and if your wife was worried she would say something.", "Sounds like you\u2019re having a really tough time and you\u2019re scared. \n1. I\u2019m sorry you didn\u2019t grow up in a physically affectionate family. I didn\u2019t either but I did grow up in a loving home. The expression of that love was simply different. I hope yours was similar and you come to terms with how different families express love. Perhaps worth considering how in adults we call it love languages. If you\u2019re raised by two adults, neither of whom have physical affection within their language it makes sense they wouldn\u2019t use it for their children. \n2. You sound very scared for your wife, which I think is natural. However; \n2.1 has anyone shown you an anatomical drawing which shows you where the baby is and how they\u2019re protected? This might be worth looking up. \n2.2 are the children boisterous or assaulting her tummy (albeit not deliberately)? If so, instead of telling them off, perhaps bring them into the circle of \u2018looking after\u2019 their mumma, the way you would with toddlers \u2018be extra gentle with mumma, she needs your calm love today\u2019 wtc. \n2.3 perhaps discuss with your Obstetrician about hat your wife\u2019s condition is- you haven\u2019t said and I wouldn\u2019t know enough to comment but it might have nothing to do with external factors. I had pre-eclampsia and choleasthasis- I was extremely unwell and nearly lost my baby. There were no contributing external factors that influenced it, just a horrible quirk of nature. \nFinally, my husband experiences terrible ptsd following my birth, he thought both me and the baby would die. He is very traumatised by it and still sees a counsellor. If your fears are forcing you to behave in a way that impacts on your daily life, you need help. \n\nNAH, but try to manage your fears and not project them in limiting ways on to the children.

I had my first during a bus strike that lasted almost my whole 3rd trimester and I had to lug 6-8 grocery bags the 30-minute walk from the store to my apartment, then walked up several flights of stairs. I was also working as a care aid and transferred people, some big 200-pound men, from beds to wheelchairs all day for all my pregnancies.", "Same here. Currently pregnant and dr just told me last week not to lift more than 15 pounds. I really enjoy weightlifting so I was very disappointed.", "Yes, she's on bed rest but OP is using that as a handy exucse to try to put a stop to behavior by wife and her kids that he admits never liked.", "So basically you were told not to lift much because you weren't used to it before pregnancy?", "He isn't pregnant so it really doesn't matter either way if it's his or not. His judgement doesn't trump his wife's. She will always know better about her own body and what it can or can't take.", "No it isn\u2019t ok.

I was just responding to the person who was wondering why pregnant women are told not to lift things. Good luck on the rest of your pregnancy!", "Yeah it wasn\u2019t always feasible. Like lifting my kids into and out of their car seats \ud83d\ude06. I did try not to just go around doing heavy lifting, though.", "Wasn\u2019t high risk for any of them lol. Thinking about this, now, though since lots of people have commented similarly, I had pretty bad diastasis recti after my first and by the time I got pregnant with my second, I was in PT to help it heal but they recommended I stop since it would just happen again. Tried the same thing after his birth but hadn\u2019t made too much progress (COVID had hit so\u2026yeah lol) and was trying to get back to it when I found out I was pregnant with my 3rd. She\u2019s now 10 months old and I\u2019m just now really getting back to it. I exercise and do yoga probably 3-4 times a week at least but I am specifically focusing on those muscles like I did before at PT. Maybe that was part of my recommendation?", "I was literally never told to not lift anything \u2014 just was told to not try anything new. So lifting my toddler was totally fine and normal as it was something I was already accustomed to lol", "Southwestern US and that\u2019s the common recommendation for other ladies in my area I know. Wondering if my midwife, though, recommended it for me as I had diastasis recti with my first that hasn\u2019t really gotten much better since I had all of my kids within 5 years.", "Right? I wasn\u2019t told to stop exercising. Just not to lift and to be careful with core exercises. Mostly I was told to focus on pelvic floor and leg/back as I mostly did yoga before, during and after my pregnancies.", "That's so far against medical advice the work part is illegal in Germany", "This reads like the pregnancy equivalent to \"back in my day I walked to school 10 miles uphill both ways\"", "I was not high risk for any of them and neither were the women who I\u2019ve spoken to who had the same recommendations. I can\u2019t even imagine trying to lift a 200-lb person pregnant. That\u2019s incredible to me", "I am a firm believer that the stronger you are in the delivery room, the better. Physical activity is good for a pregnant woman. How do these people think historic women bore children?", "Could you maybe still do arm raises (I think that\u2019s what they\u2019re called?) where you lift like an 8 lb dumbbell from your leg up to the side? Trying to think of things you might still be able to do if your doctor plays it but I\u2019m super clueless about weight lifting, sorry! I know that limitations during pregnancy can suck but I personally felt it was all worth it when I met my beautiful babies for the first time! You can do this!", "That probably was it or maybe a combination of diastasis recti and where the placenta was placed as another commenter pointed out. But also it really just is the recommendation I\u2019ve heard for every pregnant person I know personally in my area.", "Sure, I can agree to that", "Nailed it.", "Your comment made me laugh \ud83d\ude02", "totally, but when else can i complain about a 20+-year-old bus strike?

I would go home in tears and my ex would be like 'suck it up, people used to give birth in fields and go back to work'. it sucked. I puked at work and still had to transfer people, no one gave a shit I was pregnant.", "I don't recommend it, tbh! I was 20 and young bodies can do things older bodies can't! We had a \"transfer board\" back then that you put under the person and then slid them into the chair. These days I think I'd struggle with a 15-pound bag of rice, let alone transferring a person. I also didn't have a whole lot of choice about what work I could do back then. I would have liked the 15-pound recommendation, it might have got my ex to help with carrying the groceries :D", ">How do these people think historic women bore children?\n\nI mean, many of them and their babies just straight up died? I don\u2019t think we should treat pregnant people like glass but there is evidence that lifting heavy can lead to bad pregnancy outcomes. The same would have been true for historic women, they were just more used to bad pregnancy outcomes.", "I wasn\u2019t a sedentary pregnant woman lol. I just didn\u2019t go around lifting heavy things. I did yoga, squats, walked, basically low impact exercise but things that helped me maintain my pelvic floor, legs, and arms. I avoided intensive core type exercises.", "I just hate the whole \"porcelain doll\" phenomenon that happens during pregnancy.", "Agreed 100%. I was not a porcelain doll during my pregnancies. Yeah I couldn\u2019t lift as much and I was slower and had a harder time fitting between things (especially in those final months lol!) but that didn\u2019t mean I suddenly had to be handled with super kid gloves. I actually had my great aunt FREAK out on me when she saw me trying to lift a pot of boiling water and noodles to drain it for dinner. Honestly thank God I was paying attention and saw her come flapping at me because otherwise I would have dropped the pot and caused myself and probably her grievous burns from her nonsense.", "A very gently YTA. I understand being really anxious about people you care about, and a pregnancy is always high stress for any household, but even more so when it\u2019s a high risk pregnancy.

You stepson will not pass his ASD or ODD to your unborn child. And if you are afraid he will randomly have a meltown on top of her, thats not really how meltdowns work.

All your concern is about protecting the pregnancy...\n\nSounds to me like you still have major issues with physical affection.

Clearly, therapy is not working well enough.", "IMHO, the warmth and snuggles from her kids increase her endorphins and make her feel good and probably reduce her blood pressure. The kids are not likely to cause harm to the baby. Placentas are sacks of water that provide protection to the unborn. High risk pregnancies are generally due to internal factors. If your wife feels that her children are in any way negatively affecting her pregnancy, I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll let them know. If too many hugs were dangerous to pregnant women (especially high risk), no doubt her Doctor would inform her of such. Let her enjoy her pregnancy as much as she can.

If the laying on top of her gets to be too much she will find ways to snuggle with them that isn\u2019t too much.  \nHer kids may need some reassurance right now that they aren\u2019t going to come in second to the baby and losing perfectly acceptable physical contact may make them feel insecure.  \nMaybe offer additional snuggles yourself since that is their love language?", "Soft YTA here\n \nI get where you\u2019re coming from but uh\u2026 you\u2019re out of line. \n \nSnuggling like that isn\u2019t going to put her at more risk, unless her doctor says otherwise. \n\nI\u2019m going with soft here though because I can see how you probably feel like y\u2019all don\u2019t have a lot of control in this situation, and it\u2019s frightening. So this is you trying to exert a little control in a very scary time. Add to that, stress can make people fall back on older habits/assumptions/mindsets and the snuggling is probably magnified in your mind due to your past history about it. \n \nBut\u2026 this isn\u2019t the way to handle it.
