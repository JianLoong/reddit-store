As you to delay again because nothing will change. They will just delay and delay you. \n\nYour father chose to take a promotion and now wants you to pay for it by delaying -\"delaying\" - university. \n\nIt is not your job to supervise your brother. They need to make arrangements to get the help of a professional. \n\nThe disappointed looks and not speaking to you are abusive. You are a child. Hang in there and stay strong for the sake of your future.", "NTA.  James is your brother, but he is their child.  They are responsible for his care, not you. And as you've pointed out, there are options if they need assistance in caring for him.\n\nDo you have a school counselor or trusted adult (like an aunt or friend of your parents that you are also friendly with) that you can talk to about this?  Your parents need to hear an outsider's perspective on what an unfair thing this is to ask of you. They are too wrapped up in dealing with the fact that one of their children will never really grow up to recognize that the other one has to.", "NTA \n\nYou are NOT your brother's caregiver. That burden cannot be placed on you. Go to college and build your own life! \n\nCan they afford to hire help? If so, they need to do this. For their sake as well as to give you peace of mind when you leave home. There are \"strangers\" trained to take care of people like your brother and your parents need to realize they won't be around forever. If James can't be self-sufficient, then they need to make a proper plan that does not rely on you.", "NTA and I am so sorry. You are in no way responsible for parenting your brother. I can understand that you may be experiencing guilt, but please don\u2019t. You are not his parent, you are his sister. It really sucks that you have to deal with this and I wish you didn\u2019t have to. The guilt may not go away easily, but you have no reason to feel that way. Also, your parents are being completely unfair. They are trying to put their responsibilities on you. Don\u2019t let it get to you.  Again, I\u2019m so sorry that you are dealing with this.", "NTA. Quite frankly it seems they aren't really asking you to postpone because when next year rolls around they will simply be in the exact same position that they are in now. They're asking you not to go at all. \n\nIt would be one thing it they have a concrete plan of how things are going to be different in a year and what they are going to when you are gone next year ( that can't be done for you to go this year). Tell your parents it's no for now but you can perhaps revisit the subject when they have a real plan for how they're going to deal with things with you gone.", "NTA.\n\n\"Just wait a year\" is going to turn into waiting forever.  You know that in a year, James will still need constant supervision, and your parents will still think that's your responsibility rather than theirs.\n\nIt's not.  Having a severely disabled child is exhausting, and your parents are deliberately refusing to get help.  You do not owe them decades of your life because they refuse to have home health aides.\n\nJust keep telling them \"I am going to leave home and live somewhere else. I am not going to take care of my brother for the rest of my life.\"", "Absurd. He's your brother, not your child... nor your ultimate responsibility! Go to college, earn your degree, and build your future. If your mom is a stay at home mom, she has plenty of time to care for HER child.

He is their responsibility. They are out of line just for the suggestion. They need to do the job they signed up for as parents. \n\nDo NOT let them hold you back for a second.", "NTA you have been a third parent your whole childhood.

What about the next. And the one after that. And on and on. Your parents age and become to frail to care for him. You. Will. Never. Leave.\n\nIt\u2019s certainly your parents choice not to hire highly trained people to help care for James but it\u2019s not their choice to use your life to care for their son. James is their responsibility- not yours.\n\nI strongly suspect James would be far better off in a home where there are trained to properly care for him. I suspect he\u2019d be happier and your family would be healthier. But that\u2019s a path your parents have to take. \n\nDon\u2019t pick up that load. You will never be allowed to lay it down.", "NTA. Your parents might be scared and overwhelmed but they are still being terrible parents to you. They owe it to you to support you and parent you and want what's best for you. Instead they're using you as a third parent/carer and your childhood has been stunted because of this. That is abusive. \n\nPlease get away and go live your life. You deserve it, OP. Your parents will make new plans once they know you're serious and they can't trap you any longer. Don't let them make you think they have no other options. \n\nPlease don't tell them of your plans to leave until you're out in case they try to stop you.

As part of the family, it's good for you to help out when you can, but the ultimate responsibility falls to your parents. They're TA for getting mad and trying to guilt trip you about it tbh.\n\nI hope that your brother can find the help and comfort that he needs, but it should not be holding you back from living your life.", "NTA - its not your job to parent your brother. but u might need to move out because i doubt they will let this go if u still live at home after reaching 18", "NTA. You know what typically comes with a promotion? More money! The argument about trusting strangers with your brother is nonsense. Your parents need to hire someone to look after him and there are also probably people who could help him with his behavioural issues. You're not their free caregiver and they're assholes for expecting otherwise and guilting you about it. Even if your parents couldn't afford it, I'd just change my vote to no assholes. But it sounds like this problem can be solved without you, they just don't want to.", "Your parents are wrong and unfair. You need to go to school on time. Your mother is a stay at home mom. She is the one responsible for your brother. If she can\u2019t handle him they need to hire people to help. It\u2019s their problem they don\u2019t WANT a stranger not yours. It is not right to hold you back from you building your life. Stay strong and let them get use to you going to university. They can stay mad until they see you walking out the door. They are still wrong", "NTA. It's terrible and selfish of them to expect this from you. You need to go be your own person. Besides, what happens after you skip a semester or two? Do they have a long term plan besides guilting you into staying?", "NTA! 100%! \n\nFamily is important and all that but a real supporting family would never ask you to cut your wings and jeopardize your future when there's so many options to care for your brother. It may hurt their feelings but your parents should try to see the bigger picture. \n\nI really wish your parents will come around and realize that this is a very important milestone in your life and that'll help forming the path for your future. Good luck \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "NTA \nYour brother is not your responsibility. You have your own life ahead.", "Nta, you are not his full time caretaker. Your parents need to get a professional or figure something out on their own because it is not your responsibility to look after him 24/7.. im disappointed that they would even ask you to postpone.", "NTA. And it\u2019s downright emotionally abusive for them to try to guilt you about this. My sister was in a similar situation and I could not convince her to break free. She\u2019s now 34 and still lives at home. Do NOT let this be your life. \n\nThe best thing you can do for everyone involved is get the education you need to live independently. Then, after you\u2019ve done that and ideally gotten some therapy, you can decide whether helping your parents is the right decision for you.", "Nta what going to magically change in a year?  Your brother will still be autistic, you dad will still have the job.\n\nGo.  This is not your problem to fix.", "NTA.   Ask them what it is that they think is going to change in the next year, which will make the timing of you going to university more convenient then.   The answer is nothing will change, so a delay of a year will not assist them.", "The more your brother gets used to having other people around caring for him,  the easier it will be for him as he ages and things change.  Your parents are neglecting to prepare him for the future,  and are trying to use you to put off that work and effort.\n\nWhat happens when he's a full grown man? What happens if he has a meltdown and hurts himself,  or someone else? Why is your stay at home mom unable to care for him,  but they expect you to be able to? What happens when your parents pass,  and he can't handle the sudden change? What happens if they don't set up his future,  and you end up being responsible for him? Financially,  you going to university is the most sensible action.", "They're right. Family helps each other. And in this case your family needs to help YOU go to university.\n\nThere are programs out there. Someone can come in during the day while your Mom is there and help her, and become a familiar presence in his life and not a stranger. There are respite care programs. Your brother should be on Disability which allows him access to Medicaid and/or Medicare (assuming you are in the US). There are autism waivers under Medicaid that can help.\n\nThey have a LOT of options that don't include you. Stick to your guns.\n\nNTA", "Nta. I'm sure I'll get hate but people who are nonfunctioning should be put in a group home where there's someone to care for them that knows what they're doing.", "NTA.  In this situation you are not responsible for your brother and your parents should have been aware you were going away and made plans other than emotional blackmail.", "NTA. I\u2019m a divorced mom and my ex doesn\u2019t help. My older daughter is a senior and my 15yo daughter is autistic and intellectually disabled. 18yo will watch 15 for an hour here and there if I need to run an errand but overall she\u2019s my responsibility. I chose to have my kids, I\u2019m the mother. It would break my heart if 18 couldn\u2019t live her life because she felt she had to parent her sister. They chose their life, you get to choose yours. Go with a clear conscience and no guilt.", "NTA. No, just no, this is way too much to ask of you. You have a life. You\u2019re entitled to go and live it.", "NTA!!  Your parents are huge AH's though.  \nRUN!!! Don't walk, run as quickly and as far as you can!!  \nIt's sad, it's difficult and it is in no way whatsoever your problem. Asking you to sacrifice (postpone) your education to care for him is outrageous. And don't kid yourself, it'll be one excuse after another to keep you locked into his care.  \nYou've done enough. It's time to prioritize yourself.", "Where do you live?  Is he in school?  In the US he could stay in public school until he is 21.\n\nEither way. NTA.  They will never be ready for you to go...go live your your life, go to school!", "The truth is, someday you *will* end up responsible for your brother. Your parents aren't going to be able to do it forever.  They will get old and frail, and they will die. Even if you don't end up taking him into your home, you still will be the responsible party.  And, that will likely include financial responsibility, too.   You need your education, not just for you, but for him, too.  \n\nExplain to your parents that your getting an education is what is best for everyone, including your brother.", "NTA. Has he not had early intervention? Does he not have a case worker? These are crucial in ensuring your brother is cared for in the future. What happens when he's a legal adult? Does he qualify for aid of any sort? What are their plans for his future care? Oh, wait.. they'll expect *you* to do it? That's unrealistic and irresponsible. They cannot, should not operate on the baseless hope you will put your own future on hold. \n\nI have seen so many of these stories, I've lost count. I get the whole strangers thing, but there are entire agencies, programs, and services that can and will step in to help people like your brother. But by choosing not to,  your parents are leaving him in a precarious situation in regards to his future care. Expecting you to put your own life on hold is not to anyone's interest. \n\nYour parents are responsible for your brother. Not you. Help is one thing, but they need to get their heads out of their ass and get in touch with the resources available to families with autistic children. They can do far more for him than you can on your own.", "NTA. \n\nDo NOT postpone. It\u2019ll be a new excuse every year. \n\nIt\u2019s time for you to live your life. It sucks for them, I get it. But, at the end of the day, it\u2019s their child, not yours.", "Its ok to choose yourself. One day you may be in a position where you may choose to help them (totally your choice), but he is not your responsibility.", "This is such a tough one. Not tough to say that you are definitely NTA but tough as in the position you and your family are in. \nUnfortunately, your parents have to come to terms with the fact that you and they can no longer be the sole caregivers of your brother.  If he\u2019s too big for you I am guessing that your mom is in the same position or soon will be. At 15 he has not finished growing physically.  \n\nThey need to start transitioning him into some kind of group home. I know that it\u2019s not what they want but it\u2019s what he needs. Realistically he will out live them, it will be better for him to be accustomed to living in a group home rather than all of the sudden having to go. He could still come home on weekends and holidays or for visits but 24/7 simply doesn\u2019t work for everyone. He would be learning how to cope without family around. I love that you have a way to calm him but he has to learn other ways too. \n\nWould you be able to help with the transition and take online classes the first semester if needed? I\u2019m not saying that you should have to, just asking if that\u2019s something that would help your parents while not delaying your schooling. Again you are not an AH even if you decide you would rather just start school with your class.\n\nIt\u2019s so very hard for parents to have to accept that they have to place a child but they have to face the inevitable and start thinking about how to prepare your brother for the next steps in life. \n\nNot speaking to each other is only making things worse. Your parents need to have some tough conversations but frankly you should not have been put in this position. \n\nAgain, NTA. Do you know an adult (an aunt, uncle, grandparent) who can help you bring this up with your parents?", "Firstly, it\u2019s clear a lot of people have a bit of an agenda in the comments, so be mindful of this.  Your parents are just frustrated and at this point it\u2019s relatively normal for them to have some frustrations (even if they are misplaced).  \n\nIt sounds like you have been a great sibling and a great help to your parents, however, you need to be able to live your life.  \n\nYour parents are probably struggling with the idea of you leaving, so take the lead and ask for a sit down chat.  Come prepared, find relevant help, for example in the UK different Autism Service groups will provide regular assistance and even breaks for parents if they need.  Your parents might not be keen, but explain if you stayed another year, then in another year they would only have to go through the process anyhow.  \n\nExplain that what you want is important and why it is important and stand firm.  \n\nThey will come round to your way of thinking pretty quickly (at least they should) and if they don\u2019t, then perhaps get a 3rd party family member who they know and respect and who sides with you (if not a teacher, etc) to sit down with you and them.  If this still doesn\u2019t work, then maybe your parents are a\u2019holes after all.  \n\nNTA", "Unless you pay me.

When they throw the \u201cfamily helps family\u201d at you will respond yes, family does help family.  I have helped as much as I could while growing up and going to school, you are my parents and you need to help me go to school and be successful. It is unreasonable to ask me to skip a year, because we all know that the likelihood of me going later will be slim.   \n\nYour parents need to accept the fact that they need help with your brother and the longer they put it off, the harder it will be to get it.  \nYou might, in a calm moment, and perhaps with a disinterested third party attending (like a counselor) ask your parents what arrangements they have made for your brother\u2019s care and well being when they are no longer able to care for him themselves.   THAT is going to be a huge issue.  They are going to say that you will take your brother in and care for him.  You will say no.   They will yell.  You will hold firm.  That will be the issue that beaks your family apart.  \n\nPlease, go to school.   Kick its ass and graduate at the top of your class.  Find a trusted counselor at school and discuss the issues with your parents and brother.  Have an outlet that isn\u2019t your friends.", "And next year they will ask you to delay again.  Then it will be you can go to the local college or online. Start setting hard boundaries now or you will be his caregiver when your parents can't.", "Agreed. I want to add, though, that OP needs to start making sure they are not the \"plan\" for care after the parents die. The parents need to get arrangements in place for what's going to happen after they are gone and OP has their own family.", "For sure. They are absolutely working on installing that moving goalpost.", "What a good idea!", "YES, this! What a great gift for James! And a beautiful way to show your brother how much you love him \ud83d\udc96", "LOL I love the unicorn typo. This is a good point too that I forgot to include in my post. They will keep pushing it back indefinitely until they've completely broken OP's will and she will be stuck forever. \n\nI hope she gets out and lives an amazing life.", "And, if dad just got promoted, maybe spend some of his raise on getting help for Mom with Bro.", "This x 1,000, Salt-Lavishness-7560! James WOULD be happier and better off in a residential program; he'd have friends, activities that he could enjoy and would learn some very basic independent living skills while having 24/7 care. In short, he would have what every adult SHOULD have - a life of his own!", "Now it\u2019s \u201cjust one year, since dad got a promotion\u201d but next year it will be another excuse, then another. If OP stays home now it will only get harder and harder to leave.\n\nThere are also some wonderful in home caregivers out there. Sure there are some duds, but most are nice people with hopefully some training and experience working with people with disabilities. The parents are doing everyone, including themselves, a disservice not exploring that option.", "I don't see why you should get hate. It's reasonable. Someone has to care for them when the parents are no longer able to. And that's on the parents to arrange.", "\u201cNon-functioning\u201d is a bit stigmatising - they aren\u2019t non-functioning - they very much do function, would you call a child non-functioning? But I agree those who need caregivers should have trained professionals plus it can help them get more independence for adulthood.", "OP already **is** their parents' plan for lifetime care for James - hence their \"delaying tactics\" in trying to discourage her from getting out and getting a life of her own.", "Hah, I must have corrected it at the same time as you posted. Half tempted to change it back.... \n\nI just really worry that OP has had her life predetermined by her parents", "Exactly!!!", "Not to mention caregiver burnout is a thing, especially when the caregiver is a family member and not trained on how to take care of someone with special needs.", "Yeah, but there is lots of time for that to be changed if it's addressed now."]}
