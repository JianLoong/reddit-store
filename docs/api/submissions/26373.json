Many wait until start of the second trimester when the loss of pregnancy is far less likely. It\u2019s completely normal for her mother to know as well(she lives with you), she\u2019s directly involved in the situation, your mother is not. \n\nStop trying to be a man and just be a husband and soon to be father, dang.", "Info:  why wouldn't she want to tell your Mom?", "YTA. As a medical student, you especially should be sensitive to the fact that miscarriages happen in 1 in 4 pregnancies and that your wife may want to wait until 12 weeks to tell people because of that.  Has she even had a blood test or ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy yet?  I would, at minimum, wait for those to announce, as it could be a normal pregnancy or something less normal that maybe your wife doesn\u2019t want everyone to know about.  You have the medical knowledge to know WHY you should wait to tell people.  This is about being fair to your wife, not being fair to your mom and anyone she plans on telling in her excitement.\n\nEDIT: just read you had the ultrasound to confirm.  How far along is your wife? It\u2019s definitely relevant to the judgment here.", "YTA. You wife's pregnancy should be regarded as her private medical information. It's very common not to tell anyone during the first trimester. If something happens and she doesn't carry to term, the more people know about it, the more she will have to explain it when she doesn't have a baby. She's not being disrespectful. She's being smart. You don't get to \"put your foot down\" about this and the fact that your parents pay for your apartment is completely irrelevant.", "YTA\n\nAnd your post history leaves me confused\u2026", "INFO: How far is she into the pregnancy?", "NAH. It's normal not to tell anyone before a few months. I know my wife and I didn't tell anyone until after the 3-month mark. Lots can happen early on and you don't want to have to deal with social pressures if something goes wrong. Also, to your wife the pregnancy has practical implications she'll probably need some time adjusting to.\n\nSo your wife may just need some time. Give her that. When the pregnancy is further along, then sure, go ahead and tell. That's your baby as well, you have as much right to confide to your mother about it. But don't force it early on.", "I didn't tell anyone untill I was 16 weeks.  Then we told everyone else at 19weeks.  She doesn't have to do anything. yta", "YTA. 100000000%", "Yta. Many women don't tell friends and family until they are sure the pregnancy is viable. 15-20% of pregnancies or roughly 1 million pregnancies a year end in miscarriage. You've never dealt with that have you? Yta to your wife for putting your mother's feelings ahead of hers.", "YTA. Also? Bringing up the financial stuff is creepy red flag to me. Your wife doesn\u2019t owe anyone information on her pregnancy, however much or little she contributes to household financials and whether or not your folks pay for anything. Yikes.", "YTA she found out a few days ago so you need to calm down and cool it with the \"she doesn't contribute\" bs what was the point of including that? who cares if your parents pay for the apartment it doesn't mean she's obligated to tell them anything wtf", "What exactly do YOU pay for? Your dad pays for the apartment and your wife pays for food. Her mom only knows because you live with her. You're the one being disrespectful and selfish. They'll find out eventually. YTA", "NTA BUT that doesn\u2019t make you right. I completely understand where you\u2019re coming from but it is really normal not to tell people about your pregnancy at first as it can be a risky and unsure time. Many women I know tell their mothers not mothers in law immediately, not as a slight but because they are closer to them and rely on their support. When your wife is ready to tell people, make telling your mum ready special. I promise she will understand why she wasn\u2019t told immediately.", "YTA. \n\nYour mother will find out soon enough. It is not disrespect, it is your wife wanting to wait a little bit.\n\nThere are going to be a lot of decisions regarding parenting that your wife is going to need to make, and if her mother is living there, she is going to discuss with her mother. She will not involve your mother in those discussions. It's not disrespect, it's living arrangement and it's closeness with her own mother. Stop viewing this through a lens of disrespect, and view it through a lens of your wife's comfort, convenience, familiarity, and mental health.\n\nThere's a good chance your wife would not even have told her own mother about the pregnancy if she was not living there. Again, it is not disrespect, it is A matter of her personal medical information.\n\nAlso, consider that not everyone is the same. For example, some people can keep a secret, and some people can't. I don't know if your mom is the type of person who would put this information on Facebook, or who would tell the rest of the family, but perhaps there's a reason that your wife does not want your mother to know right away. respect that choice and understand that it is not disrespect, your wife might have a very good reason. \n\n\nI have seen people abuse others by saying \"they disrespected me! That's why I hit them. That's why I abused them. I will not allow them to disrespect me.\" That is why I will not accept \"disrespect\" as an excuse or reason for someone to do what they want. Because disrespect is a made up thing. It's something you make up in your mind because you want your own way.\n\nSo take that out of the equation. Your wife isn't disrespecting you or anybody else. In fact you can easily flip that around and say that you're the one disrespecting your wife. Either find a real reason, or be kind to your wife and understand that your mother will find out soon enough, and it will be fine.", "YTA\n\nIt's not uncommon for people to wait until the 3-month mark to tell people.\n\nHer mother lives with you - keeping this from her would be insanely problematic.\n\nSaying that you 'put your foot down and told her she's being disrespectful' sends up a tonne of red flags, OP.", "YTA. The fact that you pay for the appartment doesn't give you the right to take any more decisions than your wife.", "NAH\n\nIt makes sense why you are concerned for your parents\u2019 feelings. It also makes sense why your wife feels more comfortable telling her own mom over yours. \n\nHow far along is she? If she is less than 10 weeks or so, it makes sense to wait a couple more weeks to tell your parents. If your wife has a miscarriage (very common early on), who is going to comfort her? Likely her own mom, right? And in that tragic case, it would probably be very difficult for her to have a similar conversation with your mom, who she doesn\u2019t seem to know all that well yet. \n\nWhat if you take on the responsibility for future updates to your parents? She can be with you for the initial announcement, but you will have the conversations with your parents about how things are going after that?", "YTA - her mom knows because she lives with you because of an abusive relationship. It's early and she has every right to not tell anyone until she's comfortable and further along. All you're doing is contributing to stress. Maybe work on that bedside manner.", "YTA- why are your mother\u2019s feelings more important than your wife\u2019s? 12 weeks is usually when people start telling family. Your MIL is a little different story because she LIVES WITH YOU. Since you \u201cput your foot down\u201d are you also going to demand that your whole family be present and staring at all of your wife\u2019s business on display while she\u2019s in labor and delivering if your MIL is also in the room? Tit for tat and \u201cit\u2019s only fair\u201d don\u2019t work when pregnancy, birth, and babies come into play. That kind of behavior ruins relationships, and if you continue to push this, it\u2019s not only going to sour your relationship with your wife, but it could also sour her relationship with your mother.", "YTA. She is naturally closer to her own mother than yours. You absolutely do need to tell your mom and should not wait TOO long but I think insisting it be now is unnecessary. You aren't your wife, you aren't the one who is pregnant, and you need to give a bit of leeway to let her get used to the idea, process her feelings, etc. It can make a person feel very vulnerable to be pregnant, it can feel invasive for other people to know aspects of your life that feel private (almost medical in nature), and so on. I do appreciate you are eager to celebrate and share with your family and your wife can't wait forever but it's ok for your mom to stay in the dark for a few days or a few weeks.", "YTA, because of pregnancy symptoms being very severe I had to tell my boss and students I was pregnant with my second pregnancy very early on. I miscarried. Having my miscarriage that public made what was already a horrible experience even harder. Your wife gets to decide who to tell and even she's ready to tell. Sometimes you don't have a choice like I did, but if you do have a choice you should totally let her make that choice for herself.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s customary to wait until the first trimester is near the end to announce the pregnancy to people. This is mostly because of the prevalence of miscarriage. It\u2019s perfectly reasonable to wait a bit to announce because of this. Your wife is in scary, unknown territory and deserves some grace and understanding. Your parents will know in due time. It\u2019s ok to wait a bit. It\u2019s not a sign of disrespect for your wife to be cautious. Don\u2019t respond with pressure and anger because months from now when the pregnancy is proceeding nicely, this early decision to wait a bit to tell your parents and others will all be a distant memory with no hard feelings.", "YTA. Your MIL was told because she lives with you guys otherwise your wife would not have told her. It's extremely common to not tell anyone before the end of the first trimester due to the miscarriage risks. Your wife is protecting herself in the event that she miscarries.", "NTA\n\nIt's your child and you want to share the news with your mother. That's your decision, not your wife's.\n\nIt's better when you're both in agreement, but if you can't get in agreement then YOU decide when to tell YOUR mother about YOUR child.\n\nETA: I know people usually keep it to themselves during the first trimester. But you don't want to go around telling everyone. You want your mother to know because her mother knows. It's only fair. Unless you can't trust your mother to keep it a secret I'd just tell her. I wouldn't keep it from your wife, I'd be very clear that it's your decision and that if her mother can know about her grandchild so can your mother. This has nothing to do with bodily autonomy.\n\nETA2: many people are talking about a possible miscarriage. Yes, many people don't say anything before 12 weeks because of that. But a miscarriage doesn't just happen to the mother. It also happens to the father. And any of them may need a support system. The father is entitled to have that support from his parents as much as the mother. He's not talking about telling everyone. It's his mother.\n\nI can't even imagine not telling something like this to my mother.\n\nAnd to people talking about personal medical information: If they were using a surrogacy would you think they couldn't tell their parents if the surrogate didn't want them to?", "NTA, but.... \n\nIt's very likely that she wants to wait until the 12-week mark when the chance of miscarriage is low enough that she feels comfortable to tell others.\n\nThis is the most common approach.\n\nIts devastating for women when they go through the first one, and with miscarriages happening 1 in 4 pregnancies, she just wants to play it safe.\n\nSome people also have beliefs that talking about it too much is bad karma/luck. Some folks are even so strict as not to buy a single baby thing until the baby is born.\n\nTalk to your wife like an adult. Without this, \"put my foot down\" nonsense.", "Why does her mom know? It is not hard not to talk about it around other people, even if they are living in your house.", "NTA", "ESH - The way your wife is arguing about it is not okay and very disrespectful. You are going to be a parent as well and she is putting it like its only her child.\n\nHowever, it is very common not to tell anybody in the first trimester and insisting that she tells your mother and in extension probably tons of other people is also not okay. Saying that her mom already knows and therefore everybody else needs to know as well is not a valid point, since her mom is living with you and it would be pretty much impossible to hide it from her.", "YTA.
