I asked him what his partner did for work. He immediately snapped saying \"I'm not gay\" I was shaken. I was not trying to imply he was gay, I used partner because I did not know if they were married or engaged or just dating. Ive used partner before and people usually just say \"oh that's my gf, wife, etc\" \n\nI tried to explain why I said partner but he wanted nothing to do with it. He lost his mind yelling about how \"Cassie\" looked nothing like a man and how disrespectful I was being to her for implying that she was. That of course got everyone's attention. The host tried to meditate the situation but Ryan insisted we be made to leave. My husband tried defending me too but Ryan would not stop going on and on about how only LGBTQ people used partner. The host made it clear that we did not have to leave and Ryan needed to chill.

However some of my friends say I should just say gf or bf and then let people correct me so I don't misgender someone. But I don't think \"partner\" is misgendering.

I took some ideas and found Cassie on social media. I messaged her and asked if she was okay because of how Ryan pulled her out. She confessed to me she was hurt by his actions and was on the fence about leaving him. We talked on the phone for close to an hour. I linked the post so she could see all your advice/support.

I believe it's a bit of a stretch to misgender someone when using they/them. You can argue that by *non-gendering you're misgendering*, but that's a stretch. Unless someone is using they/them in a mocking manner and trying to be disrespectful, I don't think it's misgendering. Go back and read the definition of they/them, it's used to reference someone that's already been identified. It's similar to using he/him or she/her when you've already established the person's name. It's odd to constantly say, \"**Jake** asked me to refill **Jake's** beverage, so I grabbed **Jake's** cup and filled it with water and handed it back to **Jake**.\" What you're going to say is, \"**Jake** asked me to refill **his** beverage, so I grabbed **his** cup and filled it with water and handed it back to **him**.\" Or you might say, \"**Jake** asked me to refill **their** beverage, so I grabbed **their** cup and filled it with water and handed it back to **them**.\" IMO, I don't think this is misgendering.

Defaulting to gender neutral language is fine, but deliberately avoiding a person's known identity in favor of neutral language is not.\n\nIn the case of POC, de-gendering was a method by which people upheld white supremacy. POC were viewed as genderless, specifically as a way to dehumanize them. White supremacists held the belief that gender differentiation was a sign of superior evolution and genetics, and that POC lacked this differentiation. This idea was also present in antisemitic beliefs. While it isn't as overt as it once was, these ideas have still trickled down in various ways, and still hurt people.\n\nIn the case of TGNC people, de-gendering is often an intentional form of misgendering. It's something people attempt to use as a \"middle ground\" when they don't want to respect a person's identity, but also don't want to overtly misgender them. It's a way to avoid a person's proper pronouns, while still trying to be subtle or give themself an excuse. This often comes alongside gaslighting and/or victim-blaming: *\"Why are you so upset? They/them is for everyone. I'm not misgendering you.\"*\n\nOP obviously wasn't de-gendering/misgendering anyone here, but there *are* instances in which gender neutral language counts as a form of misgendering."]}
