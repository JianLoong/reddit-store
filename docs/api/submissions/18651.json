I asked him what his partner did for work. He immediately snapped saying \"I'm not gay\" I was shaken. I was not trying to imply he was gay, I used partner because I did not know if they were married or engaged or just dating. Ive used partner before and people usually just say \"oh that's my gf, wife, etc\" \n\nI tried to explain why I said partner but he wanted nothing to do with it. He lost his mind yelling about how \"Cassie\" looked nothing like a man and how disrespectful I was being to her for implying that she was. That of course got everyone's attention. The host tried to meditate the situation but Ryan insisted we be made to leave. My husband tried defending me too but Ryan would not stop going on and on about how only LGBTQ people used partner. The host made it clear that we did not have to leave and Ryan needed to chill.

However some of my friends say I should just say gf or bf and then let people correct me so I don't misgender someone. But I don't think \"partner\" is misgendering.

I took some ideas and found Cassie on social media. I messaged her and asked if she was okay because of how Ryan pulled her out. She confessed to me she was hurt by his actions and was on the fence about leaving him. We talked on the phone for close to an hour. I linked the post so she could see all your advice/support.

There's nothing shameful about that...", "At my age with how long I've been with my partner, I feel a bit juvenile calling him my boyfriend. If I'm speaking about him to people older than me or people who I don't know, I'll use a partner.  OP could also just be polite by using partner to be respectful and neutral.", "Right? How is \"partner\" misgendering someone? You'd be more likely to misgender someone using bf/gf.", "I use Partner with my SO.  We never plan to marry but calling him boyfriend feels weird when we have been together over 20 years and have kids and a house together.", "Partner was also our preferred term as well. It took my husband 7 years to propose and after 1-2 years of dating it felt silly to refer to each other as bf/gf and fiance didn't roll off the tongue either.

I don't have to think back all that far to when the understanding was that it referred to people in a same-sex relationship rather specifically. From that, it can get read as the same sort of issue as \"which one of you is the woman\" sorts of things towards gay couples. If it means \"person in a same-sex relationship\" then it has a lot of additional issues with its use. It's just that the word, in the US, has really broadened in use in the last several years and I'd also not be surprised if people haven't caught up with that. Less than a decade ago, hearing someone mention their partner was a very good indication to me that they were either gay or not American.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not saying that change is a bad thing or that his reaction is defensible, only to say that not everyone is going ot have the same connotations for a word, and how they're familiar with it being used can shape their reactions (rightly or wrongly).", "Why is it annoying?", "Sibling deliberately uses those despite being in what one might term a forward facing het marriage just to normalize the more generic terms in wider usage.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Though it wouldn't justify any of the rest of this, and it would mean having missed the shift it's been undergoing. So it's less of a \"primarily uses it\" and more of a \"in experience, that's the exclusive use\" (this also contrasts with other regions where it is not primarily used by the LGBTQ community because it's in common use... there was a time where hearing it used basically told me someone was either gay or from UK/Australia)\n\nObviously, none of this absolves his behavior and I'm not suggesting to give him benefit of the doubt, but it is a word that has changed in connoted meaning quite a bit.", "I'm 51 and same. \"Boyfriend\" just seems weird, but I'm not bothered by labels.

I believe it's a bit of a stretch to say it's a sub-form of misgendering someone, unless the person was intentionally trying to be an asshole knowing that this would push someone's buttons.
