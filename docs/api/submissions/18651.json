There was a couple there we hadn't met before so I was trying to get to know them. I was talking with \"Ryan\" about his girlfriend (didn't know this at the time) who was in the kitchen. I asked him what his partner did for work. He immediately snapped saying \"I'm not gay\" I was shaken. I was not trying to imply he was gay, I used partner because I did not know if they were married or engaged or just dating. Ive used partner before and people usually just say \"oh that's my gf, wife, etc\" \n\nI tried to explain why I said partner but he wanted nothing to do with it. He lost his mind yelling about how \"Cassie\" looked nothing like a man and how disrespectful I was being to her for implying that she was. That of course got everyone's attention. The host tried to meditate the situation but Ryan insisted we be made to leave. My husband tried defending me too but Ryan would not stop going on and on about how only LGBTQ people used partner. The host made it clear that we did not have to leave and Ryan needed to chill. That pissed him off so much he grabbed Cassie by the wrist and pulled her out of the house still yelling. \n\nThe host said I did nothing wrong and so did his wife. However some of my friends say I should just say gf or bf and then let people correct me so I don't misgender someone. But I don't think \"partner\" is misgendering. My cousin said that I was being rude and inconsiderate of Cassie's feelings by not using her name but if I'm being honest I didn't remember her name because we had just met and I'm awful with names.\n\nTLDR I used the term partner and a straight guy mistook it as me calling him gay \n\nSo AITA?", "created_utc": 1685556013, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13wtadg/aita_for_using_the_term_partner/", "score": 132, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Like putting pronouns in your social media bio or email signature, it doesn't have to mean that  you are part of the LGBTQ+ community, but it normalises the practice, making it safer for non cis/het people to do it.
