No one else can smell anything. I finally lost it and yelled at her, pointing out how her house always smells like dog poop and she called me TA for making her feel incompetent. \n\nHi all. Annie (24F) and I (22F) have been friends for years. While we generally get along great, she always makes me feel insecure every time she comes over to my place.\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve got multiple cats and work extremely hard to keep my home clean and smell-free. I\u2019m talking air purifiers in every room, vacuuming twice daily, steam mopping everyday, dusting furniture, changing bedding very frequently and ensuring all pet products, including bedding, dishes, fountains, litter boxes etc. are very clean and sanitized. Cats also get groomed regularly. I don\u2019t just do this before guests, this is my daily cleaning routine (I don\u2019t work). \n\nEvery single time Annie comes over to my place, she makes me feel extremely self-conscious and without fail, makes comments regarding the \u201csmelliness\u201d of my house. \u201cDang if you\u2019re gonna have guests over, at least make sure your house doesn\u2019t smell like shit\u201d along those lines. Every. Single. Time. It\u2019s gotten to the point where I\u2019ve gotten paranoid about inviting people over. \n\nI\u2019ve asked ALL my friends and family if they can smell anything in my home and literally everyone says no and praises how clean I keep it. Even my brutally honest friends have said that my house smells like absolutely nothing. There\u2019s no weird \u201ccat smell\u201d. Now I\u2019m worried. Is she lying or is she the only one telling the truth? \n\nThings came to a head three days ago. We went out and decided to relax at mine on our way back. Before even entering my house, Annie pulled out perfume from her bag and upon entering, proceeded to spray it everywhere while saying \u201cphew, this thing\u2019s a saviour!\u201d \n\nImmediately, my flat-faced elderly Persian who already has trouble breathing started sneezing continuously. You guys, I lost it. I yelled at her telling her that she\u2019s either a liar or she just wants to feel better about herself since her house always smells like shit. She\u2019s got two huskies that she rarely grooms, her backyard always smells of dog poop since she never picks it up and her house 100% has the \u201cdog smell\u201d but no one says anything because we\u2019re too polite. \n\nShe started crying and called me TA for making her feel bad about her house. She works full time and I don\u2019t, so she said that having a clean house is a privilege and that I\u2019m being boastful. I countered with \u201cthen stop saying things about my house!\u201d to which she replied \u201cyou don\u2019t work so you should keep your home cleaner\u201d. \n\nAll my other friends are on my side but I can\u2019t help but wonder, AITA?", "created_utc": 1700179267, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17x1jn8/aita_for_telling_my_friend_that_her_house_is/", "score": 96, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You have one life and you're wasting some of that time on an asshole", "Wow I had a \"friend\" like this. I stopped inviting her over because she'd always point something out that was \"messy\" about my place yet her apartment was an absolute MESS, I mean shit everywhere, and I was nice enough to never say anything. It made no sense but I found out that she was just a toxic person who deep down had some jealousy towards me for whatever reason. Sound similar? \n \nDefinitely NTA. She had it coming. Even if your place was dirty or smelly, a real friend would bring it up nicely and not be disrespectful EVERY single time they go to your place. I'm sure the perfume is more a life saver for her own stank lol. Oh and I love how she admits that you in fact do have a clean house and she doesn't because she works full time. What a joke. I think it's time to reevaluate that friendship", "INFO: Why are you friends with this person?", "Absolutely NTA I would\u2019ve been like \u201cit\u2019s YOUR smell bouncing off the walls\u201d and sprayed her with her perfume \ud83d\udc80", "NTA. Annie is not your friend. She\u2019s the kind of person who has to put others down to make herself feel better. Those types never get better. Kick her to the curb.", "NTA This doesn't sound like a friend to me, especially one who'd ever be invited to my home.  \n\nFriends don't make snide comments like that.  If she was a true friend and your home really did stink, she would tell you in a way that isn't rude or insulting.", "NTA. Your friend needs to learn some manners. It's not okay to constantly criticize someone's home when there's no evidence to support their claims. It sounds like you take excellent care of your place and shouldn't have to feel insecure because of her comments. Keep doing what you're doing and don't let her bring you down.", "NTA, time to stop allowing her in your home.  \n\nDoes she go out of her way to put down other stuff about you/your life?  \n\nIt sounds like your reaction made her reveal some deeper resentment and jealousy she has.   She thinks telling you your house stinks makes her house better.  She doesn't want to you to think you keep a cleaner home than her.  When you didn't take it, she exposed that you not working is an issue as well and she uses it as her excuse for your cleaner house.  \n\nShe sounds like the kind of person that belittles anything a normal person would admire or envy because she makes everything about her.    Does she put down nice things and accomplishments of others?   For example, if you were to start taking a class and get a degree would she sincerely congratulate you or would she say things like \"If I had extra time, I'd do that too\", or \"I read something bad about online degrees, I wouldn't waste my money\".  \n\n\nIf you really wanted to see her blow her top, offer to show her some housekeeping tips you've learned.", "NTA\n\nI also don\u2019t work & have two cats. people love to assume that when you don\u2019t have a job, you should be spending every second of the day cleaning, cooking, or doing something productive when that isn\u2019t the case. yes you should do it more than normal i guess, but no one should ever tell you \u201csince you don\u2019t work, you should do this more\u201d like ??? no absolutely not, that\u2019s a shitty friend. \n\n& side note, my cat has respiratory issues so he can\u2019t be around any perfumes, air fresheners, ect or he\u2019ll have an asthma attack. if someone walked into my home with a bottle of perfume & started spraying it everywhere, i would also lose my cool. much worse than you did if i\u2019m being completely honest. it\u2019s disgustingly disrespectful & id like to assume your \u201cfriend\u201d knew about your cats health issues since she\u2019s been around for so long\u2026.which makes it even more disrespectful. some people just need called out on their shit & get off their pedestal.", "NTA. Annie is being a brat.", "Nta\n\nShe is insecure about her own home. Honestly, her behavior is disturbing. I wouldn't be inviting her over anymore.", "You continue to be friends with this person because....\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd don't say: \"because we've been friends for so long...\" or \"she helped me through some thing...\" or \"then I wouldn't have anyone...\" \n\nbecause any reason really to stay friends with someone who constantly criticizes you is not a good reason at all.", "NTA. So she can insult other people but can't cop it back. Nah man, not how it works.\n\nIf she is too busy to keep her house clean and pick up the dog shit, she should not be a pet owner.", "***you don\u2019t work so you should keep your home cleaner***\n\nAnd your reply should have been that your home IS cleaner.  And to advise your 'friend' not to let the door hit her on the way out.\n\nShe went above and incredibly BEYOND rude that it is literally unforgivable.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. It's super weird that she cares so much about the cleanliness of your house when you are clearly going above and beyond to have it be clean. \n\nI honestly wonder if she smells, like her house probably, and she gets nose blind to it, but then when she's at your place with zero competing smells, she starts to smell it. And that's why she smells it everywhere at your place, cuz it's her smelling everywhere she goes. \n\nI have a chronic illness that during flares sometimes I smell things much stronger than normal and also smell things that usually are so faint that people usually don't smell them at all. It could be that she has something like that, though it seems improbable since it happens every time she's at yours. And because I would never ever spray a bunch of perfume when I'm like that, I'd probably feel so ill I'd puke my ever living guts out. \n\nAlso, who the f*ck thinks it's okay to start spraying perfume all over in someone else's house! And who the f*ck thinks it's okay to announce every time they are there that it stinks! Like you said, her house actually stinks and none of you said anything out of politeness. Her behavior leans more towards being jealous and making up a thing about you to make herself feel better, which is just not the type of person who makes a good friend imo.", "This is going to sound weird but being in a fresh clean environment may be emphasising lingering particles from her own living space in her nose and around her face. Especially if her poop smell is as bad as you say it is - dirty dogs and dog poo festers and lingers everywhere.\n\nThat\u2019s giving her a benefit of the doubt that she\u2019s not projecting, which is also a high probability. Either way, she is rude af and you are NTA", "NTA the only way I can see this being done without malice is that she's not used to being in clean air and can suddenly smell herself instead but doesn't realise.", "NTA, although you are wrong in calling this person a friend. You are correct when you say that she just wants to feel better about herself.\n\nBesides, everyone knows that cats smell better than dogs. LOL", "NTA, cut her loose. She basically admitted she does it to make you feel bad out. Because she\u2019s jealous you have time and resources to keep clean. She sounds exhausting.", ">I\u2019ve got multiple cats \n\nIs there a reason you're not saying how many? Because if you've got 10 cats then she might not be wrong.\n\nNTA regardless. The solution to her sensitive nose is that she doesn't visit any more. You're not a hero for screaming about her house being disgusting, so I assume you realize your friendship is now over.", "YTA to yourself if you continue to be friends with Annie. OP end this friendship.", "NTA\n\nSome folks have a stronger sense of smell or are triggered by some smells (so it\u2019s stronger for them than others).
