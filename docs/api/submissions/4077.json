Most of the time I brush my teeth while I go take a shower so when I say I'm going to bed I can go right to bed. My husband brushes his teeth before he goes to bed because sometimes he'll drink or eat something after his shower (if I've already brushed my teeth I don't eat or drink anything but water after). We've been married 35 years. I don't think I've ever had such a stupid argument. Your girlfriend is looking to start a fight.

You have a lot of crevices \ud83d\ude06", "The silent treatment like this sounds like it really serves no purpose, except to perpetuate the petty. If you're going to use the silent treatment, might I suggest using it constructively? It might help you in future disagreements as well.\n\nWhat I mean is to let her in on it, tell her you'll speak to her again when she's ready to apologize. Don't just \"punish her\" by not speaking to her for the day. Then she'll just think you're the asshole for that. And she'd be right.\n\nBut if you give her a path toward making amends then the ball is in her court. She could apologize right away and then you can work towards moving forward together without either of you stewing about it the rest of the day because of an arbitrary timeline. Or, she might never apologize and then you move on knowing you dodged a bullet.\n\nThat said, NTA. And if she's acting like this as just your GF, then this is absolutely the hill I'd die on. Establishing proper boundaries early in a relationship is important, and she comes off as very controlling based on your post. I can't imagine letting this slide because it'd be teaching her that you're okay with being treated this way. Can you imagine her as your wife and living with this behavior permanently? Just, ew.

I get it, I can feel all that stuff too, although I'm too lazy to brush that long lol.\n\nSomething I have found helps is using a damp cloth to wipe clean the surfaces of my teeth, in addition to brushing. Sometimes the toothbrush just can't get all of it, or it takes too long. I have these thin little washcloths from when my kids were babies and they're perfect for my teeth. I think they're Gerber brand. Might be worth a try and save you some time. Then you could download TWO games after you say you're going to bed!

Top, inside, outside. Then floss, scrape tongue (or tongue first, whatever).

Any longer, youre setting yourself up for future issues.", "Can also cause receding gums.", "Twice a day for two or three minutes is what most dentists are recommending these days.
