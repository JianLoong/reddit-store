Since I still am a student I generally work during the summer. I\u2019m a sailing instructor during the summer which means I had to leave him for a little more than a month as we don\u2019t live near the sea. \n\nWe planned to see each other this weekend. I even made sure to work more so that I could take my Friday afternoon off and go see him on Friday night. However, on the way back I got really sad from leaving my sailing club and I was so tired that I decided to stop at my parents house which is closer than where my boyfriend lives (I study in another city). I got sick the past few days and after driving for 8 hours I couldn\u2019t bear to go any further. \n\nSo I called him and told him that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. I just wanted to rest and that I would stay at my parents house as I was too sick. \nHe got sad but accepted it. Then I asked if he could come see me instead. He refused. I called him to try to convince him but he blew up on me for ruining the weekend and that he didn\u2019t want to meet my parents like that. \n\nI didn\u2019t really understand his thinking but he then went on and told me that he had refused some work projects to see me and that I needed to be more careful with his time since he is already independent and my parents still support me financially. \nI just apologized and replied that we could see each other at my hometown as it\u2019s not that far and he is always welcomed because my parents own some tiny flats that we could stay at. That way he wouldn\u2019t have to meet them. \n\nHe finally accepted but then asked me to pay back the movie tickets he had bought since we weren\u2019t going anymore. It was 10$. \nTo end everything he called me a child for doing that and that I should take responsibility over my choices. \n\nI let him hung up and cried. I knew he was disappointed but I don\u2019t think I deserved this disrespect. He was so mean and agressive. \n\nAfter thinking for an hour and calming down I just told him to send me his PayPal and that we were over. I deserved a guy who is kind and respectful. \n\nNow I kind of feel guilty because I violently broke up with him over a few texts. He pleaded me to think about my decision again that I can\u2019t do it like that. He keeps saying that he loves me and that he misses me. I feel bad for hurting his feelings but everyone around me says I deserve better.\n\nEDIT: I cut my foot open on a rock a few days earlier and got an infection that necessitated surgery intervention. The infection affected me pretty badly hence why I am sick and am not able to drive for too long since it still hurts a bit.

I live in a medium sized town and I would be able to get a refund with that story (my date needed surgery and I had to leave town to go be with her), and if a refund wasn\u2019t possible I could exchange it for a different showing the next weekend.", "Refreshing to have an OP that acts with clarity with such a big red flag as ex-BF\u2019s behavior!

This isn\u2019t just an maturity issue, it\u2019s also a character issue.  He had expectations for his own wants/needs for your visit and got all kinds of whiny that your life didn\u2019t wrap around his dick.   \n\nA good man would have sympathized you were not feeling well and wished you good health at minimum. He didn\u2019t want to make the drive to see you at your patent\u2019s house because his wants/needs may not have been feasible.  \n\nYou\u2019re young and I\u2019m old. I\u2019m terribly skeptical of people but I\u2019ve also been around for a very long time  and here is one immutable truth. \n\nPeople do exactly what they want. If he wanted to see you, he would. People always do what they want. \n\nGood news?  You\u2019re young, you\u2019ll have lots of break ups, you\u2019ll be OK and you learned a little something about him and others so you can choose the right kind of people to give a little bit of yourself.", "Look at you!! Figuring it out so quickly. Nice work. Funny how you're actually more mature than him huh?", "Really well said.", "You are a few months in and he talks to you like that? Run a mile", "NTA, but I understand why he would be upset. He prioritized spending time with you over his work and then, not only was it all for nothing, but he felt pressured to meet your parents. He was being an AH for asking for $10 back. All in all, I don't think it will hurt to give this relationship ONE more try.", "NTA, OP. You really can do it like that, and it's perfectly okay. He can pound sand.", "He acted like an asshole.  But I do think he had the right to not come to visit you instead, given that it was a last-minute change of plans.\n\nHe accepted that you couldn\u2019t come.  You then asked him to come.  He said no.  You called him to \u201cconvince him.\u201d  He blew up.  \n\nIn the midst of this, he said he doesn\u2019t want to meet your parents this way.  You then suggested that he just come to your hometown and not meet them.  **Why would someone do that?**\n\nI think you expected him to drop everything and come to you, and you asked him numerous time after he said no, and you made suggestions that did not make sense.  Yes, your foot was cut.  But that didn\u2019t require a visit from him.  I think you could have accepted his \u201cno\u201d and just moved on.\n\nHis escalated response shows that he lacks patience and self-restraint.  And requesting $ for the tickets was just unacceptable.  But you were also acting like a spoiled child who couldn\u2019t understand that \u201cno\u201d means he doesn\u2019t want to come.  \n\nESH.", "I was halfway through and thought this isn\u2019t healthy for her and was glad when you said you already broke up. It hurts but if he treats you like this over something so small imagine if bigger problems arise. You did good. Hope you get well soon \u2665\ufe0f\u2665\ufe0f", "NTA and good for you. Seriously Brava.", "NTA - what you describe what happened to you is pretty serious as you would have got an infection and had sepsis which can kill someone if untreated. Not sure he realised the seriousness of the situation but if he knew he should be the one who should be feeling bad.", "You said it. You deserve someone who is kind and respectful. He is not. He doesn't seem to care about you all that much. Find someone better.

Don't go back to him.", "NTA \n\nIf you take him back now, he will treat you the same. \n\nGive it time. If he really wants to change and do better he will work on himself and do what he needs to to win you back. \n\nIf you still miss him after a while you can talk again and see if anything has changed. \n\nYou do deserve better. This is setting your boundaries, telling him what you are willing to say is ok. \n\nYou should also tell him to think,  if he really thinks treating you that way is good.", "I get the idea of not wanting to meet your parents for the first time so haphazardly but the rest of this is pretty immature on his part. He needs to learn to regulate his emotions when he is feeling let down or disappointed.", "NTA you got an infection in your foot and had surgery. Your boyfriend didn't come to you right away, he didn't come to you slowly either. He wanted you to drive to him. Then complained about movie tickets? There is a reason why no one his age wants to date him.", "Or he could have said he wasn\u2019t coming like he did and she could have accepted that and acted accordingly.  He said he didn\u2019t want to meet her parents this way or just come to the hometown without meeting them.  Moreover, if she was sick, having visitors was not a great idea.  \n\nIt was not wrong to not come.  It was his choice to make.", "That's what I'm thinking, at that point why even go you're hurt. If I was him that would've been why I would be angry she even came, she should be home resting not driving all the way over here, you ever vacation with a person in pain, it's impossible\ud83e\udd37.\nI would've been angry she even made the trip in that state, hence why I'm asking did she go see a doctor? Cause she prolly shouldn't be using that foot, and if he knew he's an even bigger d###. Cause he shoulda cancelled himself at that point", "He didn\u2019t blow up at first.  OP said he was sad but accepted it.", "Fwiw, OP said he \u201cgot sad but accepted it.\u201d  OP then asked him to come to her instead, and it looks like the argument started at this point.\n\nI\u2019m just pointing out that his *initial* response was to say okay.  He didn\u2019t immediately launch into asshole mode.  It seems as if he got angry when OP asked him to come to her instead.", "See my issue is if we knew exactly what he said when cussing her out we could make a better judgement, she could've maybe minimised her injury to him over the phone and he ended up putting his life on hold expecting the world only for this abrupt cancel and then maybe it's the infection or the meds or she was already frustrated and misunderstood, or he's a dick. But it's the insults for me\ud83e\udd37", "Which is fine but when she asked if he could make the effort to come after she drove 8 hours post surgery, he blew up. He could've responded and told her he didn't want to talk until he was calm enough to explain his side", "I 100% agree with everything you said.  I can\u2019t help but to feel this argument (early on) partly is the result of both parties being frustrated with not being able to see each other as planned, and lots of miscommunication or misunderstanding.  \n\nBut what you said is what I wish I had said in my comment lol.", "Actually, I agree with you.  She did say he initially he refused but she called to try to convince him.  It is possible that when \u201che refused\u201d he did so reasonably and *then* blew up after being asked multiple times?  There\u2019s some missing info in the timeline.\n\nIn the end, I think the worst thing that happened was him asking for the ticket $ back.  Once he did that, nothing else mattered.  It\u2019s pretty shitty.", "That's true. It's weird to me that he would ask for $10 back. If $10 is gonna hurt your pocket book, he should've told her in the beginning", "[removed]", "NTA.
