Since I still am a student I generally work during the summer. I\u2019m a sailing instructor during the summer which means I had to leave him for a little more than a month as we don\u2019t live near the sea. \n\nWe planned to see each other this weekend. I even made sure to work more so that I could take my Friday afternoon off and go see him on Friday night. However, on the way back I got really sad from leaving my sailing club and I was so tired that I decided to stop at my parents house which is closer than where my boyfriend lives (I study in another city). I got sick the past few days and after driving for 8 hours I couldn\u2019t bear to go any further. \n\nSo I called him and told him that I wouldn\u2019t be able to make it. I just wanted to rest and that I would stay at my parents house as I was too sick. \nHe got sad but accepted it. Then I asked if he could come see me instead. He refused. I called him to try to convince him but he blew up on me for ruining the weekend and that he didn\u2019t want to meet my parents like that. \n\nI didn\u2019t really understand his thinking but he then went on and told me that he had refused some work projects to see me and that I needed to be more careful with his time since he is already independent and my parents still support me financially. \nI just apologized and replied that we could see each other at my hometown as it\u2019s not that far and he is always welcomed because my parents own some tiny flats that we could stay at. That way he wouldn\u2019t have to meet them. \n\nHe finally accepted but then asked me to pay back the movie tickets he had bought since we weren\u2019t going anymore. It was 10$. \nTo end everything he called me a child for doing that and that I should take responsibility over my choices. \n\nI let him hung up and cried. I knew he was disappointed but I don\u2019t think I deserved this disrespect. He was so mean and agressive. \n\nAfter thinking for an hour and calming down I just told him to send me his PayPal and that we were over. I deserved a guy who is kind and respectful. \n\nNow I kind of feel guilty because I violently broke up with him over a few texts. He pleaded me to think about my decision again that I can\u2019t do it like that. He keeps saying that he loves me and that he misses me. I feel bad for hurting his feelings but everyone around me says I deserve better.\n\nEDIT: I cut my foot open on a rock a few days earlier and got an infection that necessitated surgery intervention. The infection affected me pretty badly hence why I am sick and am not able to drive for too long since it still hurts a bit.

How do you take responsibility for being sick? That's weird. The ten bucks is kinda petty too. Go with your gut here: if you felt like he crossed a line and you don't want to be around him, trust that. \n\nIt's easy to act kind and respectful. It's when shit goes sideways that you see who a person actually is. Here, all it took was you being too sick to drive to see him to unleash the nastiness.", "NTA. He was mean and petty when you are genuinely sick. Good call to break up you do deserve someone who respects you b", "NTA. \n\nKind of him to show you where his priorities lie when you\u2019re in bad shape. You can rest assured your breakup was a good choice.", "NTA. He thought by dating a 20 yr old, he could just have you be at his disposal. You got ill, shit happens, meeting parents is no big deal and Mr Independent should not be annoying you for 10 bucks. You did good breaking up.", "NTA. Stuff happens. People need to learn to be more flexible. You didn\u2019t get sick on purpose and you were trying to make new plans. He was being a petty brat. You did the right thing.", "NTA You can break up with anyone, at anytime, in any way, that you want.\n\nhe was throwing a tantrum and you didn't want to deal with it, so you ended it. He is now panicked because he didn't think you would actually do anything.\n\nIf you were that sick, HE should have done something for you.", "NTA. Did he even once express sympathy for your pain and illness? Did he offer to drive to see you in your city rather than have you travel while sick? Did he acknowledge that you rearranged your work responsibilities to be with him?   \n\n\nNope. And the ticket thing is just petty. Send him a bill for the petrol you wasted on the trip.", "You violently broke up over text. I very much doubt that. Did you threaten bodily harm? Because short of that, I dont think it was violent.", "Nta.\n\nYou just had surgery? And you still drove? Sheesh.\n\nYou can break up with someone for any reason at all....

He rightfully wanted money back for something he paid for that would no longer happen because you changed your mind.\n\nHe compromised and was willing to come to where you were, even though he didn't want to and that wasn't the plan, but you immaturely couldn't admit that you did anything wrong here.\n\nDoes he not deserve someone kind, who respects his time?

He had expectations for his own wants/needs for your visit and got all kinds of whiny that your life didn\u2019t wrap around his dick.   \n\nA good man would have sympathized you were not feeling well and wished you good health at minimum. He didn\u2019t want to make the drive to see you at your patent\u2019s house because his wants/needs may not have been feasible.  \n\nYou\u2019re young and I\u2019m old. I\u2019m terribly skeptical of people but I\u2019ve also been around for a very long time  and here is one immutable truth. \n\nPeople do exactly what they want. If he wanted to see you, he would. People always do what they want. \n\nGood news?  You\u2019re young, you\u2019ll have lots of break ups, you\u2019ll be OK and you learned a little something about him and others so you can choose the right kind of people to give a little bit of yourself.", "Look at you!!
