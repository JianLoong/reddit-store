I have shut the door to my cabin for having lunch when a dog tried to enter. I know, generally i dont do this to humans but i dislike pets near me when i eat lunch. People in office started accusing me of being an asshole for shutting the door on dogs face.\n\n2. It might make me the asshole as i closed the door on the dogs face and not let in. But in my defence, it is who i am, A person who dont like dogs.\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

It comes across almost cultish. NTA. You shouldn't be questioned for not wanting a dog around, food or no food. Dogs aren't for everyone, and that's fine. You are far from the only person who's ever had a bad experience with one, so how nobody seemed to make the connection is frustrating.", "NTA\n\nI don\u2019t know why some people with pets just insist that everyone must love and want to be around their pets too.\n\nYou\u2019ve done nothing wrong but you should talk to HR ASAP- these people are creating a hostile work environment with their behavior. You\u2019ve been attacked", "NTA\nSome pet owners don't know, understand, or respect boundaries. You didn't disrespect the dog. You simply shut your door.", "NTA, but what kind of fucked up rule allows everyone's dogs in the office? And, even more fucked up, why are you being forced to like it? You should not have to explain yourself, if you don't like dogs then that's your thing! They should respect that.", "NTA. They way overreacted. You didn\u2019t kick the dog and I\u2019m sure the door didn\u2019t connect with their face. If they don\u2019t like it, all they have to do is keep their pet away from you.", "NTA and its work place bullying by a bunch of animal nutters. You don't have to like dogs or forced to pet them if you don't want to as it isn't something you enjoy. You have every right to be worried about your cleanliness while you are eating and your cabin is your private space where you don't have to have anyone or anything you don't want. If it was upto me I would have placed a 'No Pets Allowed' sign and made it very clear that peoples pets are their own problem and I do not want to find pet hairs in my cabin as I am allergic to it. What the animal nutters did was very wrong and I think you should complain to the HR and get some policy amendments as there could be others similar to you who doesn't like pets. Maybe they can have a common area for pets but there's no place for pets in an office as not everyone need to like them or give a toss about putting them. Its not a zoo.", "NTA\n\nYeah I know because they love their dog and are being very protective, but honestly it's annoying, you can't forced everyone treat your dog just like you", "NTA. Dogs aren't people. The end.", "NTA - they literally can get fucked.", "NTA", "NTA It's pretty disrespectful to just barge into someone's office, let alone barging into someone's office with their pet.

Im the biggest dog person out but your coworkers are behaving like children.", "NTA.\n\nAs a pet owner, it's their responsibility to keep animals leashed.

I used to not like dogs till recent past so I get exactly what you are feeling.. You don't like dogs in your personal space specially when you are eating..you were completely within your rights to not let that dog enter the cabin by shutting the door..\nIn this case I feel that the pet parents in your workplace overreacted!!!", "NTA- No one should be forced to do something. What if you have an allergy to dog hairs do you still have to pet them? Overall just closing the door to be alone is not wrong no matter if it is on a dog or a human. These people act weird af.", "NTA and I love animals more than I do people. Animal or person, no one should have to eat around anyone they aren't comfortable with.", "Sadly, when i get this topic, many people say youre just overreacting or that their 3 year old plays with the dog happily and being an adult man, im a impotent idiot to be afraid of them.", "Some parents started bringing their little kids to office since no one was there to take care of. Then this trend led to pet owners asking permission for their pets as well.", "Omg so sorry to hear you're bitten by the dogs twice. Its horrible", "3-year-olds would play happily with a serial killer, to be fair.", "Well, I hate that for you, to say the least. Your fear isn't irrational and it sucks that everyone trivializes it so much.", "The three year old does not know that the dog may bite him.", "Crazy shit, I don't quite follow the leap from kids (weird enough in itself) to pets. Maybe a change of office (job) would do you good?", " It was many years ago.  Both times I was lucky to be wearing loose clothing, and both dogs only scratched me with their teeth but tore my clothing.   They would've drawn blood if I hadn't moved quickly.  It was terrifying. If I hadn't moved they would have sunk their teeth to the bone.", "And their own poop", "I\u2019ve still got the scar in my cheek from when a Rottweiler \u201cwho would never hurt a fly\u201d bit three-year-old me on the face and dragged me across the room.", "NTA why can't some people not accept and respect that not everybody loves dogs. I also don't like dogs. They can live there merry life away from me but don't force them on me and please control them. Especially in busses or train i don't want them jumping or licking on me. \n\nThe reaction of the collegues are afwul. And their comparisons. To put an unknown animal on the same level as your wife? Wtf?! I personally would go preventative to the hr and let them put this down. Who know what will follow.", "NTA.  I will never understand dog people. I, too, used to work in an office that allowed pets from time to time. I am highly allergic to most animals, and when pets would come in, I would simply shut my office door and choose not to interact. Occasionally, I will give a short pat on the head, and then immediately go to the bathroom and wash my hands. The amount of grief, ridicule and cajoling I\u2019ve gotten for \u201cnot being a dog person\u201c and \u201chating dogs\u201c is unbelievable.", "I don't like dogs- no traumatic reason- I just generally find them irritating.  I am nice to then, give them a quick pat and move away because I don't want to be sniffed, barked at, or rubbed up against by a dog. Most good dog owners will recognize this and call their dog. If someone is so oblivious to allow their dog to wander behind me when I am trying to find a place to eat peacefully,  closing an available door is the perfect option. I am sure the dog was fine with it.\n\nI adore cats and have several. Plenty of people are not wild about cats. If I have guests in my home who don't care for animals, or don't like cats, I put the cats in the bedroom for a little while. Do they like it? Not really- but they are perfectly fine for a couple hours while serving dinner. \nIt is the job of the pet owner to ensure their pet isn't being a nuisance to others.  \n\nI like nothing better than to have cats climbing all over me but not everyone feels that way. As a pet owner,  you really need to read the room. You did NOTHING WRONG\n\nNTA"]}
