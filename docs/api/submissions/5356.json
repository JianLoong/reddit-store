I have shut the door to my cabin for having lunch when a dog tried to enter. I know, generally i dont do this to humans but i dislike pets near me when i eat lunch. People in office started accusing me of being an asshole for shutting the door on dogs face.\n\n2. It might make me the asshole as i closed the door on the dogs face and not let in.

It comes across almost cultish. NTA. You shouldn't be questioned for not wanting a dog around, food or no food. Dogs aren't for everyone, and that's fine.

You should not have to explain yourself, if you don't like dogs then that's your thing! They should respect that.", "NTA. They way overreacted. You didn\u2019t kick the dog and I\u2019m sure the door didn\u2019t connect with their face.

If it was upto me I would have placed a 'No Pets Allowed' sign and made it very clear that peoples pets are their own problem and I do not want to find pet hairs in my cabin as I am allergic to it. What the animal nutters did was very wrong and I think you should complain to the HR and get some policy amendments as there could be others similar to you who doesn't like pets. Maybe they can have a common area for pets but there's no place for pets in an office as not everyone need to like them or give a toss about putting them.

I used to not like dogs till recent past so I get exactly what you are feeling..

Animal or person, no one should have to eat around anyone they aren't comfortable with.", "Sadly, when i get this topic, many people say youre just overreacting or that their 3 year old plays with the dog happily and being an adult man, im a impotent idiot to be afraid of them.", "Some parents started bringing their little kids to office since no one was there to take care of.

Maybe a change of office (job) would do you good?", " It was many years ago.

I also don't like dogs. They can live there merry life away from me but don't force them on me and please control them. Especially in busses or train i don't want them jumping or licking on me. \n\nThe reaction of the collegues are afwul. And their comparisons. To put an unknown animal on the same level as your wife? Wtf?! I personally would go preventative to the hr and let them put this down. Who know what will follow.", "NTA.  I will never understand dog people. I, too, used to work in an office that allowed pets from time to time. I am highly allergic to most animals, and when pets would come in, I would simply shut my office door and choose not to interact. Occasionally, I will give a short pat on the head, and then immediately go to the bathroom and wash my hands.

I am nice to then, give them a quick pat and move away because I don't want to be sniffed, barked at, or rubbed up against by a dog. Most good dog owners will recognize this and call their dog. If someone is so oblivious to allow their dog to wander behind me when I am trying to find a place to eat peacefully,  closing an available door is the perfect option. I am sure the dog was fine with it.\n\nI adore cats and have several. Plenty of people are not wild about cats. If I have guests in my home who don't care for animals, or don't like cats, I put the cats in the bedroom for a little while. Do they like it? Not really- but they are perfectly fine for a couple hours while serving dinner. \nIt is the job of the pet owner to ensure their pet isn't being a nuisance to others.  \n\nI like nothing better than to have cats climbing all over me but not everyone feels that way.

You did NOTHING WRONG\n\nNTA", "NTA\n\nDog people get really weird about dogs", "I don't know, I think that shutting the door on someone who's coming into a private room to try to mooch food off you is wholly reasonable, actually?

I allow mine to be in the room while I eat but she can't be in my space and if she starts eyeballing my food I shut that down really quick.\nI'm sorry you work with idiots.

However, I will not allow any animal to be in my face when I am eating. And any animal that comes charging at me when I am eating we'll find itself on the other side of a closed door. Especially if it is not one of my own animals who are better trained than that.\n\nTell your coworkers that if they want to claim that their animals are their family, then they better have their furry children better behaved so they don't charge at someone else who is eating. You respect their right to have their animals with them on pet Day, and you expect them to respect your right to not want the animals with you or anywhere near you when you are eating.

You did something very reasonable. And as a dog owner, this lady's dog shouldn't be barging into places ahead of its owner. It's not safe, and it's bad training; if you don't know what's past a threshold and ok it, your dog shouldn't be going in there. Closing the door on a dog trying to go somewhere without permission is how you teach that, and I've done it to my dog plenty of times. Dog doesn't care, because it's a dog. Its feelings are not hurt, because again, it's a dog. If you slammed the door on the dog's actual head, it'd be a different story. Closing the door in its face is fine. \n\nYour co-workers are assholes, and to top it all off I wouldn't trust their dogs to be well trained enough not to try stealing your lunch while they were there.
