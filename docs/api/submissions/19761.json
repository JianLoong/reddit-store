I just had one yesterday\u2026 and those are the best when your on your period. Lol he needs to apologize.

You deserve an apology whether it was over a brownie or a gaming system, doesn't matter what the object is.", "NTA. \n\nStealing food is shitty behavior and your brother sucks. I've been there - I worked from 15 onward consistently and my older brothers who worked much less consistently often stole food and such. It's infuriating. \n\nYour mom sucks for not supporting you.

Your brother is an entitled asshole though", "Your brother is a greedy mooch. He knew it was your brownie but he stuffed his face with all of it. He didn't even leave you half.

Just inform your mother that you will be storing food in sealed containers in your room until she can ensure that your brother will not steal your things. You won't be eating there but you need a safe place to put things where the brother won't steal them.\n\nShe's not going to like being dictated to... and i hate this word... but it's time to start setting boundaries with your mother and your brother.

So it's time to get sneaky\n\nAs for speaking to him, don't let your phone get taken away for this crap.  Answer him.  But avoid full on conversations.  That way he can't whine to your mom about it.\n\nLook...your brother is super immature and your mom doesn't care that he is a grown man acting like a toddler.  It sucks.  i know.

So accept that this is the way things are and start hiding your brownies and other food you may want to keep out of his grubby little hands", "NTA - if your mom wants to get involved, let her know that all of this will go away once your brother apologizes for the brownie that you brought home, put away, and labelled.  If she shows any signs of push back, let her know that she is enabling this shitty behavior from your brother and stand your ground.  You deserve the respect.", "NTA\n\nYour mom is seriously out of line in expecting *you* to make the problem go away. \n\nIf she and your brother don't like the consequences of your brother's actions, they can address what he did. Your mom is not on your side. I'm so sorry.\n\nWith your mom as his fixer, your brother is well on his way to being an entitled AH, which will not serve him well later in life.", "NTA - You sound pretty grown up compared to your 23y old brother.

You're in your rights to be upset with him, as he's being childish.   \n\n\nBUT, I'd also not hold onto a brownie as a thing to be super-mad about for more than a couple of days. If it's an ongoing trend of disrespect, I can get that - but a brownie by itself, even a very important one on a bad day, which I totally get - shouldn't be a \"forever mad\" situation.   \n\n\nI do hope he makes an attempt to make it up to you, though.", "There is the optimal situation and there is how real life works.  When food hits a shared fridge, anyone might eat it.  You need to defy the \"no food in your room\" rule, that is the solution.  Find a hiding place and store it in your room.
