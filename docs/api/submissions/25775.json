I was ready to write NTA until I saw you were living with her to save up for a deposit. You know the more people that come to the shower the more things you will get for the baby that you need. You shouldn\u2019t be this stressed over the shower. You should be this stressed about bringing a baby into the world you can\u2019t afford to support. It can\u2019t be a \u201cvery intimate experience\u201d when you are living in someone else\u2019s home. Focus this energy on making enough to support your baby on your own without living with you mom.", "ESH. I hate to say it but you\u2019re under her roof. You either deal with her crazy ass or cancel the shower. Everything in life comes at a cost and you\u2019re learning it the hard way unfortunately because you\u2019re pregnant. Never ask anyone for favors bc they are never free.", "If you are worried about your pregnancy and your health, set things up with that in mind. You can have a shower a year after the birth, or go Chinese and have it 100 days after it. Or have something else in lieu of a shower, like a Zoom party or a picnic. Or, gasp, no shower, but maybe telephone people to share love and news about the baby's name.", "YTA. Just for the shower here.\n\nYou didn\u2019t tell them the date didn\u2019t work and didn\u2019t intervene as the guest list was growing and when she gets upset because you didn\u2019t tell her about the date you lose your shit on her.\n\nLike she sounds not great to deal with on a day to day basis but on this issue I think you are in the wrong.", "NTA you know what you have to do. You know your are not an asshole, she needs to be far away from you.", "NTA - I\u2019m going to say something that might make people mad. But, I think you should go with what your mom is planning. Yes, it is your baby shower and I understand that she is planning things you would not like. However, the only reason I\u2019m suggesting this is to avoid conflict and stress for you and your baby. Even though she is your mom, alcoholism can be super unpredictable and maintaining a livable relationship with your mother is needed until you move out. Your health and your baby\u2019s health is priority. Pick your battles wisely with your mom. I hope you and your growing family find happiness and safety in your future", "You need to move", "NTA. I will say for any event that requires invitations be sent out and has a lot of guests when you\u2019re one of the people who set the date, pulling back on the date because you didn\u2019t check your calendar is annoying, even a month out. I think it\u2019s a smaller deal than your mom is acting like it is, but a bigger deal than you are acting like it is. \n\nStill this sounds like the least important bit. It\u2019s way more annoying that she\u2019s approaching it like this. I mean, yeah, the baby shower revolves around the mom\u2014*she\u2019s the one who\u2019s pregnant*. Why the heck does your mom think it would revolve around anyone else? And I really hope you find another living situation because she sounds like she\u2019s going to hold your staying with her over your heads for the rest of your lives. I hate guilt trips and she sounds like she lives to guilt trip people and be the center of attention. She should have just thrown a celebratory baby brunch if she wanted to just host a party and left the baby shower to someone who gets what a baby shower is. Is she this way about your wedding plans too?", "NTA. The whole thing, doesn't fact, revolve around you. In life, there are actually very few times when everything revolves around you.

I can\u2019t believe everyone is focused on the shower and not the environment this poor kid is being born into.", "I can take care of myself just fine. We had a setback financially while my fianc\u00e9 was changing career paths, during which we found out about the baby. \n\nNot that I owe you an explanation, but moving in with my parents to save money for a bigger apartment/house than the one bedroom we were paying $1600 a month for(for reference, there are 2 bedrooms in my area available now for less than $1500 a month) made the most financial sense. \n\nI\u2019m fortunate to have a good support system, doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t take care of myself.", "MIL is not the issue.

Yeah, super great support system. Good decisions for your baby. You need to do some reading about how stress during a pregnancy affects the child's brain development. I can't believe you would knowingly choose a situation that will cause trauma to your child before it's even born, to save a hundred dollars a month.", "That doesn\u2019t hold water. Why say. \u201cWe forgot about the date until Mom sent out the invites\u201d.

You kind of bury it in there but you agreed to a date, your mother made arrangements and sent out invites. After that you come back and tell her you made other plans, change it. Of course she is upset, you made her look like an ass.\n\nIf your that affaid for your health, move in with your MIL, you say she is much more reasonable", "Info: where does your partner live and why do you live with your alcoholic mother and not with him?", "ESH.

No one else", "That's a twist, a good MIL and shitty mother. \n\nRemind your mother: your body, your baby, your choice. Would she have put up with kind of behaviour from her own mother?

It\u2019s several hours of food, drinks and mingling.\n\nShe was so hesitant to let us throw her a baby shower in the first place when all we want to do is celebrate her and the new addition to our family. She didn\u2019t want us to have to do all the work to plan and throw a party. We did have to kind of tell her \u201cLet us love you!\u201d because she is the humblest person and always thinks of other first.

You confirmed the date of the shower with your mother, completely forgetting that you had another really important commitment.
