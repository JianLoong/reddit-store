I get the feeling you are every bit as extra as your Mother\n\nSo Mother gets upset because AFTER you told her a date works and the invitations are sent you change your mind.", "YTA. I was ready to write NTA until I saw you were living with her to save up for a deposit. You know the more people that come to the shower the more things you will get for the baby that you need. You shouldn\u2019t be this stressed over the shower. You should be this stressed about bringing a baby into the world you can\u2019t afford to support. It can\u2019t be a \u201cvery intimate experience\u201d when you are living in someone else\u2019s home. Focus this energy on making enough to support your baby on your own without living with you mom.", "ESH. I hate to say it but you\u2019re under her roof. You either deal with her crazy ass or cancel the shower. Everything in life comes at a cost and you\u2019re learning it the hard way unfortunately because you\u2019re pregnant. Never ask anyone for favors bc they are never free.", "If you are worried about your pregnancy and your health, set things up with that in mind. You can have a shower a year after the birth, or go Chinese and have it 100 days after it. Or have something else in lieu of a shower, like a Zoom party or a picnic. Or, gasp, no shower, but maybe telephone people to share love and news about the baby's name.", "YTA. Just for the shower here.\n\nYou didn\u2019t tell them the date didn\u2019t work and didn\u2019t intervene as the guest list was growing and when she gets upset because you didn\u2019t tell her about the date you lose your shit on her.\n\nLike she sounds not great to deal with on a day to day basis but on this issue I think you are in the wrong.", "NTA you know what you have to do. You know your are not an asshole, she needs to be far away from you.", "NTA - I\u2019m going to say something that might make people mad. But, I think you should go with what your mom is planning. Yes, it is your baby shower and I understand that she is planning things you would not like. However, the only reason I\u2019m suggesting this is to avoid conflict and stress for you and your baby. Even though she is your mom, alcoholism can be super unpredictable and maintaining a livable relationship with your mother is needed until you move out. Your health and your baby\u2019s health is priority. Pick your battles wisely with your mom. I hope you and your growing family find happiness and safety in your future", "You need to move", "NTA. I will say for any event that requires invitations be sent out and has a lot of guests when you\u2019re one of the people who set the date, pulling back on the date because you didn\u2019t check your calendar is annoying, even a month out. I think it\u2019s a smaller deal than your mom is acting like it is, but a bigger deal than you are acting like it is. \n\nStill this sounds like the least important bit. It\u2019s way more annoying that she\u2019s approaching it like this. I mean, yeah, the baby shower revolves around the mom\u2014*she\u2019s the one who\u2019s pregnant*. Why the heck does your mom think it would revolve around anyone else? And I really hope you find another living situation because she sounds like she\u2019s going to hold your staying with her over your heads for the rest of your lives. I hate guilt trips and she sounds like she lives to guilt trip people and be the center of attention. She should have just thrown a celebratory baby brunch if she wanted to just host a party and left the baby shower to someone who gets what a baby shower is. Is she this way about your wedding plans too?", "NTA. The whole thing, doesn't fact, revolve around you. In life, there are actually very few times when everything revolves around you. This is one of them.", "That made me cackle too early in the morning. \nThe more I read about baby showers, the more I'm glad it's not a thing where I'm from.\nNTA", "While I would love to do this, my mother and MIL live across the street from each other so this would be pretty difficult to pull off", "MIL has just the one bedroom house, as it\u2019s just her and her husband living there. So unfortunately, no room for us there with my 3 pets. In the meantime I\u2019ve just been doing my best to avoid her", "yeah. i\u2018d let her have a party and not show up. she wouldn\u2018t even notice. i\u2018d be much more concerned she\u2018ll pull up to the hospital and demand being in the room for the birth of her baby..", "And 3 pets", "I know. I can\u2019t believe everyone is focused on the shower and not the environment this poor kid is being born into.", "I can take care of myself just fine. We had a setback financially while my fianc\u00e9 was changing career paths, during which we found out about the baby. \n\nNot that I owe you an explanation, but moving in with my parents to save money for a bigger apartment/house than the one bedroom we were paying $1600 a month for(for reference, there are 2 bedrooms in my area available now for less than $1500 a month) made the most financial sense. \n\nI\u2019m fortunate to have a good support system, doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t take care of myself.", "MIL is not the issue. My mother is. Edit to add; I never said the original date worked-my mother decided to send out invites without checking with us first", "Mother not MIL.", "I explicitly told her I don\u2019t want a bunch of people I barely know, and she never cleared the date with me before sending out invites-just assumed we were available.", "Have one with Mil later after you move out but for your own sake cancel it now.\n\nNTA the shower is about you and your baby but you won't win the argument and will only stress yourself.\n\nReduce the amount of info you are giving her to a minimum and cross of the days until you can get out.", "I am so sorry. I hope you are able to move out soon and I wish you both the best with your baby.", "that\u2019s even worse! You bet OP is going to rehome them\u2026", "This is what a \"good support system\" looks like? If she's right across the street anyway, can you two go live with MIL who is not a boundary-stomping alcoholic?", "You're living with an alcoholic who is stressing you out so bad that you're worried about pre-term labor. Yeah, super great support system. Good decisions for your baby. You need to do some reading about how stress during a pregnancy affects the child's brain development. I can't believe you would knowingly choose a situation that will cause trauma to your child before it's even born, to save a hundred dollars a month.", "That doesn\u2019t hold water. Why say. \u201cWe forgot about the date until Mom sent out the invites\u201d.  If she hadn\u2019t checked with you, you would have simply said. \u201cShe sent out an invite without checking for a date we were already booked\u201d\n\nThat even makes her look worse.", "Even more ESH then. \ud83d\ude00 Thanks went and corrected.", "I think I read it wrong.

It was a simple mistake that I, my fianc\u00e9, my dad, and my MIL feel like she blew out of proportion. It\u2019s not a big deal to tell people \u201cwe made a mistake; here\u2019s the new date\u201d", "She's more than a pain in the ass, you literally came to the sub where you ask if she's an asshole", "Is the money you're saving worth the stress contractions/early labor you're concerned about? \n\nHonest question. Money isn't the only cost you're having to consider here.", "You can\u2019t complain unfortunately. She doesn\u2019t get to overstep because she\u2019s helping you but unfortunately that\u2019s the way it is. She feels entitled to you and your business"]}
