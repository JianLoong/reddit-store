To be honest, I completely forgot I made this post in the first place. \n\n\u2022 Family fessed up to all the requests for help basically being plots to get me and him in the same room.\n\n\u2022 He was in  *hospice* care which I mixed up with being in the hospital in my original post. \n\n\u2022He started out by basically wanting a bunch of life updates from me, basic things like what college did I go to, what was my major, where was I working now, did I have a boyfriend, etc.\n\n\u2022 He asked me if I still played soccer and I said no, not since he left me. He looked sad and said I was really good, and I agreed. I had humored him with casual talk for about ten minutes but I made it clear that I wanted answers and for the visit to be on my terms, so this was the segway into the \u201cdeep stuff\u201d \n\n\u2022 I told him I had questions for him and he agreed to answer them:\n\n1. Did you miss me? \nHe looked kind of offended by that (which I thought was very audacious) and said of course he did, and I snapped back \u201cCould have fucking fooled me\u201d and there was this awkward moment of silence but I decided to keep going. \n\n2. Why did he leave *me*? \nHe talked about how he was betrayed by my mom and looking at me was a reminder that he had been tricked into raising another man\u2019s child and then I got upset. I told him to me, I WAS his daughter. Maybe not on a DNA test but here (I pointed at my heart). He just got quiet then said \u201cYou\u2019re not mine, Sophie\u201d\n\n3. Why wasn\u2019t I, as a person, more important than the results of the paternity test? Was I an easy child to abandon? He looked kind of shocked by this one too, but I wanted to know. He goes no, of course not, it has nothing to do with you, but I snapped at him to tell me the  truth, that I deserved that much and he said very bluntly \u201cTwo kids are less stressful than three, Sophie, so yeah, sometimes I was relieved you weren\u2019t around, especially as a single parent, ok? But there\u2019s nothing you could have done to change or overcome the fact that you\u2019re not my child. You\u2019re one I got tricked into raising. You weren\u2019t mine, and you still aren\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, Sophie.\u201d \n\nThis is where the list was forgotten and I just said \u201cBut you treated (stepdaughter) like yours no problem\u201d and he said it was different. I quietly asked if she was a replacement for me and he said he wasn\u2019t going to dignify that with a response. \n\nI asked if he wasn\u2019t going to apologize why did he ask me here and he just said he wanted me to know I was in his will. I said \u201cOkay. I don\u2019t forgive you.\u201d He looked kind of shocked and said \u201cWhat?\u201d and I just repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t forgive you.\u201d He said ok and looked really sad, and added that he would pay my student loans via the will. I told him the conclusion I had come to, that forgiveness was the kind thing to do and I wish I could have given it to him, but there was too much hurt. He said he understood and I left.\n\nNOTE: Very condensed for character limit.\n\nEDIT: clarification on my mom here: [MOM FAQS](https://www.reddit.com/user/Professional_Rush_24/comments/14toozb/faqs_mom/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1)", "created_utc": 1688758212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14tgvsh/update_aita_for_not_being_the_nicest_about_my/", "score": 737, "replies": ["Well, I'm glad you're getting some money at least.

The fact he still uses \"tricked into raising you\"... jesus. What your mother did to him should have always been treated separately from his real relationship with you, and instead he let it be an excuse to snip a responsibility. \n\nAnyway, I'm glad you got some answers even if they were cruddy ones.
