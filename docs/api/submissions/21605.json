To be honest, I completely forgot I made this post in the first place. \n\n\u2022 Family fessed up to all the requests for help basically being plots to get me and him in the same room.\n\n\u2022 He was in  *hospice* care which I mixed up with being in the hospital in my original post. \n\n\u2022He started out by basically wanting a bunch of life updates from me, basic things like what college did I go to, what was my major, where was I working now, did I have a boyfriend, etc.\n\n\u2022 He asked me if I still played soccer and I said no, not since he left me. He looked sad and said I was really good, and I agreed. I had humored him with casual talk for about ten minutes but I made it clear that I wanted answers and for the visit to be on my terms, so this was the segway into the \u201cdeep stuff\u201d \n\n\u2022 I told him I had questions for him and he agreed to answer them:\n\n1. Did you miss me? \nHe looked kind of offended by that (which I thought was very audacious) and said of course he did, and I snapped back \u201cCould have fucking fooled me\u201d and there was this awkward moment of silence but I decided to keep going. \n\n2. Why did he leave *me*? \nHe talked about how he was betrayed by my mom and looking at me was a reminder that he had been tricked into raising another man\u2019s child and then I got upset. I told him to me, I WAS his daughter. Maybe not on a DNA test but here (I pointed at my heart). He just got quiet then said \u201cYou\u2019re not mine, Sophie\u201d\n\n3. Why wasn\u2019t I, as a person, more important than the results of the paternity test? Was I an easy child to abandon? He looked kind of shocked by this one too, but I wanted to know. He goes no, of course not, it has nothing to do with you, but I snapped at him to tell me the  truth, that I deserved that much and he said very bluntly \u201cTwo kids are less stressful than three, Sophie, so yeah, sometimes I was relieved you weren\u2019t around, especially as a single parent, ok? But there\u2019s nothing you could have done to change or overcome the fact that you\u2019re not my child. You\u2019re one I got tricked into raising. You weren\u2019t mine, and you still aren\u2019t. I\u2019m sorry, Sophie.\u201d \n\nThis is where the list was forgotten and I just said \u201cBut you treated (stepdaughter) like yours no problem\u201d and he said it was different. I quietly asked if she was a replacement for me and he said he wasn\u2019t going to dignify that with a response. \n\nI asked if he wasn\u2019t going to apologize why did he ask me here and he just said he wanted me to know I was in his will. I said \u201cOkay. I don\u2019t forgive you.\u201d He looked kind of shocked and said \u201cWhat?\u201d and I just repeated. \u201cI don\u2019t forgive you.\u201d He said ok and looked really sad, and added that he would pay my student loans via the will. I told him the conclusion I had come to, that forgiveness was the kind thing to do and I wish I could have given it to him, but there was too much hurt. He said he understood and I left.\n\nNOTE: Very condensed for character limit.", "created_utc": 1688758212, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14tgvsh/update_aita_for_not_being_the_nicest_about_my/", "score": 53, "replies": ["Well, I'm glad you're getting some money at least.  WTF did he expect though and what shitty answers still.  Sorry. :/", "Even if you weren't his biologically, he raised you for 7 years as his daughter. Like you said, that alone should have made you more important than the results of the test. He could have divorced your mom and still loved you as is. To just throw you away like that is cruel and cold. And then he has the nerve to double down and say you aren't his and never were, but he has you in will still? Sounds like he felt guilty and wanted forgiveness. Glad you didn't give it him. Sorry you've had to go through that pain OP. I hope moving forward you're able to live your best life.", "I'm sure in his mind the reason things are \"different\" with his step-daughter is because in the end it was never *actually* about \"raising another man's child\" or whatever, it was about the fact that your mom pulled one over on him and insulted his \"manhood\" and in his warped mind you were a representation of that. It's completely fucked and pathetic that even on his deathbed he couldn't realize how stupid he was being.\n\nI'm glad you at least got reimbursed for the financial aspect of his abandonment OP, and I sincerely hope you got whatever closure you might have needed.", "Original \n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13r7nux/aita\\_for\\_not\\_being\\_the\\_nicest\\_about\\_my\\_not\\_father/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13r7nux/aita_for_not_being_the_nicest_about_my_not_father/)", "So let me get this clear.  He's basically ignored you since you were 7, then does this ridiculous ploy to get to speak to you on his deathbed, then rams home again that he doesn't view you as his kid and expects.... what?  what on earth did he expect?  Some delusion that you would be throwing yourself at him in gratitude for putting you in the will?  \n\nI am so so sorry OP.  You original post made my blood boil and this update is not much better. I hope you got whatever you need from that meeting, and that you life moving forward will have more peace.", "Man, I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019ve had to go through all of this. No child (or adult) should be made to feel like they\u2019re not worthy as a person. I hope you\u2019re taking care of yourself and processing/getting support as you need to.", "He wanted forgiveness even while pretending he didn't need it, and he really thought some surface level interest and a place in the will would suffice. Wow.\n\nHe's right about one thing: his abandonment was never about you. And that's what made it so heinous and so cold, that he stopped recognizing you and treating you not only as his child but as *a* child and as a person in your own right, who deserved more than to be cast aside because of DNA. The fact he still uses \"tricked into raising you\"... jesus. What your mother did to him should have always been treated separately from his real relationship with you, and instead he let it be an excuse to snip a responsibility. \n\nAnyway, I'm glad you got some answers even if they were cruddy ones. I think you did well to at least say your piece and I hope it brings some level of closure. Take care, OP.", "Original post is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13r7nux/aita_for_not_being_the_nicest_about_my_not_father/)", "nta your dad and your mother are the assholes. I do have a question for you. did you ever blame your mom or called her out on what she did to your not dad?", "Oh man.  I remember your original post and thought it was heartbreaking.  I know you won't like hearing this, but at least he was somewhat honest.  I'd always prefer to know the truth over some made up story meant to placate me because at least I have the appropriate info to decide how I'd like to behave, think, and feel.  So, you have the info now, and maybe that WAS the kindest thing he could do for you in that moment.  Not sure if that makes sense.\n\nI'm really glad you got to say your piece and have your day in court with him.  Thank you for the update.", "Wow.", "NTA", "Well at least he was honest. I'm sorry OP, I can't imagine how hurtful that conversation must have been for you.", "In her original post she mentions she did, but obviously being 7 when it happened and only having her mom left, she was left with little options.  Sounded like she called her mum out when she was older, and mentioned the situation leading up to her mum cheating wasn't black and white, but didn't extrapolate (if I remember correctly)"]}
