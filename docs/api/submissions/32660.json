Your father is carrying on with stupidity, don't take it to heart and don't take it seriously, either. In fact, don't take anything a 'super religious' person says seriously, because people who are super religious don't tend to have a good grip on reality.\n\nI am very glad your mother is backing you up in this. Am I understanding correctly that your brother is on your side as well? If they do support you, then in your position I would slowly start to wear makeup, nail polish, and clothes that you like, and leave your father to his tantrums, if that is how he responds. \n\nHowever, only do this if you are absolutely certain he won't do anything stupid, which is something you should bear in mind if he is as controlling as you say. Controlling people often respond to someone trying to loosen and escape their control by clamping down harder. Religion compounds this issue because a component of most religious belief systems is that the father has the god-given right to control his daughters in such a way, which makes them impossible to reason with. Be careful. \n\nI say this as a daughter of a similarly super religious father, who also had opinions about how I groomed myself and dressed, and did not respond well when I did what I liked, anyway.", "Thank you so much for this. :)"]}
