If your father doesn\u2019t wanna see you and you siblings just cause you dyed your hard hair then he isn\u2019t a loving father. I absolutely love these religious extremists and how they think they should be able to control everyone\u2019s life.\nAnd btw if he wasn\u2019t a religious extremist I would say that he used you dying your hair as an excuse to not see you all so that he can do something else", "NTA. A lot of parents think they are slave owners and relish in it. Your hair, your choice.", "NTA - your hair, your choice. your dad is an AH for refusing to see you or your siblings because of it. Just because you share DNA with someone does not mean they have control over you, not sure of your age but there will be a time you can choose if and when you want to see him too.", "NTA. If your hair color is more important to your father than his relationship with you, you are not the one at fault. You live with your mother and she gave permission. Regardless of your age, that's all you need to know. Your dad's issues are his issues, not yours.", "Absolutely NTA. You should be allowed to make your own choices, and dad can stuff it.", "NTA - your Dad is. \n\n- from a Dad who\u2019s daughter dyed their hair without asking me (I didn\u2019t expect to be asked).", "NTA\n\nYour Mum gave you permission that is all you need. If he does not like it then tough.\n\nDo not feel bad because your father is an AH.\n\nI think you have learnt everything you need to know about him.", "Never listen to religious nuts. NTA", "NTA - you have a trash father, throw him out.", "NTA. If this is how your Dad is going to act he will just alienate you. If he will also take it out on your siblings he will do the same to them. You've done nothing wrong. He needs to get over himself or get used to being alone.", "NTA. your body, your choice. this is absolute. if he doesnt accept that, well. guess you dont have a father anymore.", "NTA though given his parenting style, if your mom does not already have full custody, I suggest you ask your mom to seek full custody. Maybe text your dad first \u201cis it true you don\u2019t want me to come over to your house because I dyed my hair?\u201d Then save his text and screenshot it. It might come in handy. \n\nYou deserve unconditional love. Your father doesn\u2019t seem equipped to give that to you.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
