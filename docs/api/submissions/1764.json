Folks comments about there being lots of free adult cats at shelters are correct, but people often avoid these because it involves an application and reference checks, so purchasing or adopting through a friend is \u201cless work\u201d. Therefore, what they said about the Facebook post might be true. Also, see if you can search around their house in case they simply let him out.

If you minded, you should have moved", "That's awful. I can't imagine someone taking my beloved Kona (kitty) away from me. My entire world would be terrible after that. I am so sorry they did this TO YOU. You are a victim of this and are certainly NTA. I am so sorry to hear this happened to you. I hope the suggestions to check shelters and your flyers work out and you are reunited.", "NTA. I would never forgive them.", "Why are you living at home after college anyways, dude?", "NTA.  Your parents sold something they knew you valued, which didn\u2019t belong to them.  Report the theft to the police, and never move back.", "NTA. You made it very clear what would happen. The fed around and found out.", "NTA\nNot even a little \n\nCall local shelters, and contact the police. They may get the buyers info from your parents and help you retrieve your cat, if they actually sold him.", "NTA, I have a Milo too, and I\u2019d lose my effing mind. I\u2019m so sorry!  Some of these suggestions in here are good ideas though, I would definitely try to find him!", "NTA - You\u2019re in the right here. That\u2019s incredibly fucked up of your parents.", "NTA,\n\nTell them all you'll talk to them again when they show up with your cat. :3\n\nI think that's a fair response before going LC/NC.", "NTa\n\n>Now I\u2019m getting constant text messages from my siblings calling me a terrible brother for leaving the house over a pet.\n\n\"Let mom and dad fight their own battles, don't let them use you.\"", "Not everyone has the same values you do. To some people, pets are extremely important, and getting rid of someone's beloved pet is an act of extreme and deliberate cruelty which warrants re-examining the relationship you have with them.\n\nYou're making some assumptions about absolutes that make no sense here whatsoever. And you act like you're the only person who's not from North America or Europe. I've been close with many people from all over the world, including in countries where pets are not highly valued in the same way they are in others.\n\nEveryone can have individual values and it's not hateful to say this thing that's important to me is important because I care about it. Whatever that is, it deserves respect and care and love.", "NTA. It\u2019s a very cruel thing your family is doing.", "NTA\n\nCall the police.  Get your pet back!!  Pets ARE family members!", "NTA \nA. they sold your property. \nB. My pets are my babies and don\u2019t mess with them!!\nI am so sorry.", "ESH You lost your cat partially because you didn't act earlier. But now, all you can do is block everyone harassing you and move on.", "Nah, dump them into the streets with nothing.", "Don't phrase it as \"gave away\" in these situations. Phrase it as \"pet was stolen maliciously and the theft hidden by giving it away.\" \n\nBecause that will help people understand they were essentially (or actually) in receipt of stolen property. And that'll increase your chances of getting your pet returned.", "Are they supposed to take the cat to work with them??? It\u2019s a cat. They can exist on their own for a workday and OP can empty the litter box when they get home. If I lived at home, I would also expect my parents to let the cat exist there while I\u2019m at work even if they didn\u2019t want it. Unless OP literally never cared for the cat I see no way for them to be TA here.", "Check all shelters and also parents fb and also fb marketplace If no luck then I suggest do fb posting but block all your family members in case", "Nta. But your parents are.  You told them what would happen and they did it anyways.", "If you have paperwork to prove ownership (ie. adoption records, microchip, vet bills) 100% report the THEFT of your animal (which is considered property) to the police. They will make your parents tell them what they did with it.  If they did in fact give it to someone, the cops will get it back for you, as it is stolen property.", "Please contact the local authorities. They stole your animal. The police can get the info and possibly help get the cat back.", "Tell them youll move back in with them if they give you the contact info of the person the sold it to. Then dont move back in and block them", "Nta at All\n\nPlease update", "NTA. If anyone did that to my pet (dog), before I moved away I would make their lives utter hell. Family or not. What a horrible thing to do. Your family are not worth it - anyone who treats a family pet like that has no heart.", "Facebook rules prohibit selling animals and selling stolen property. If you report your parents to FB maybe they could find the buyer (as well as closing your parents accounts)", "You literally warned them about what you would do if Milo were to go, it\u2019s stupid that your parents probably assumed that you were not gonna do it and sent the cat away. Did you say you loved the cat to death? Bro why are you parents so mad at smth you said you would do before hand!", "NTA.  You didn't leave because of a pet, you left because of their unspeakable betrayal.", "NTA OP call you parents and tell them to give you the info of whom they sold it to or you will be going to police about this. Pets are legally property and this is straight up theft. Tell them also you will blast them over all social media, call there jobs, tell all there friends and family, heck even make posters to put up around town with there picture and milo's saying \"These people stole and sold my cat!\"", "NTA. You told them exactly what would happen if they overstepped your boundaries, and you followed through. That isn't AH behavior, that's just good sense.\n\nAlso, selling to a rando on Facebook? Look, the rando is **probably** not dangerous, but this is a stupid, irresponsible, and borderline sociopathic way to rehome a cat.\n\nYour parents are not good people and you're wise to distance yourself from them.\n\nBTW, I'd normally not advise this, but I'm sure your parents occasionally leave their phones or computers unlocked. You may be able to get the rando's name and contact info that way.", "NTA.  Call the police and report that your parents stole your cat.  I'm not even kidding.  They'll be forced to reveal the buyer and you'll get your cat back, and your parents will be fined or jailed, like they deserve.  I would go full no-contact with them after a stunt like that.", "Nextdoor is also a good place to post this info.", "NTA. The fact that they think so little of you that they sent your cat away and are refusing to tell you is reason enough to never make contact with them again. It's a reason to when you know they're out of the house go and get your shit, I just never speak again.\n\nBut if you have photos of your cat on any of your accounts, start posting all over Facebook to try and recover them. Or at least know where they are. Check shelters, put photos up on bulletins. Your cat is your family not these people, your cat is loyal and cares about you", "YTA. Your parents are doing you a favour by getting rid of a pest like it. Cats shouldn\u2019t be pets and we as a society must do our utmost to ensure cat people are rehabilitated.", "I would consider taking something of major sentimental value that belongs to them and hide it at a friend\u2019s house. Let them stew over the loss of something of value to them.  Those parents are truly heartless."]}
