You are not valuing your cat the same as family members.  THEY didn't value YOU enough to care about your feelings.  They are horrible people, and you deserve better than that from people who say they love you.\n\nPersonally, I would have stayed an extra day at home though, pulled up their FB accounts on their computers, and found out where they gave my cat.  Usually people don't buy older cats.  Shelters are full of them for free.  They likely gave your cat away, and the person who took him may be willing to hear you out.  Or take a little payment for Milo themselves.\n\nI would also suggest contacting shelters.  They may have literally just dropped him at one.", "NTA. If I were in your position, my parents would be dead to me.\n\nFirst, animals are considered property. So you owned the cat, and your parents took it without consent and sold it. It wasn't Theirs to sell. There's a word for that. Theft.\n\nSecond, they waited specifically until you couldn't do anything about it, and sold the cat knowing how it would hurt you. And then refusing to give you the buyer's information so you can't even try and make some kind of alternate plans? There's a word for that as well. Evil.\n\nNot only would I never speak to my parents again. I would consider them enemies.\n\nAs a side note, you might want to try and look into things. There's a good possibility they didn't sell it at all. They may have just killed it or went drop it off somewhere.", "NTA at all.

But just to make sure, having a cat in the house makes the house smelly and filled with furs everywhere.  Does that cause them to hate the cat? If so, you shouldn't keep the cat if you're not taking care of it properly. Or better if you own a cat when you own your own place. Taking care of a cat is a huge responsibility.  I know I love cats. I have lots of cats.

Did the parents adopt it, or did OP? And if OP adopted it, did they get the parent's permission?\n\nI recently took in my daughter's cat, and it has been a *huge* annoyance (the one small cat causes way more trouble than the 3 medium sized dogs who already live here).

You are much better off out of that house, where what you valued had no value.  I\u2019d check their computer first to see if the links were open.

Your parents are horrible people. Report the cat as stolen. I don't know if the local police would do anything for you but what they did was theft. The cat belonged to you. Call the police and talk to them. They might be willing to go and talk to your parents and get the information about where your cat is. If they won't you can tell your parents that you will press charges if they don't tell you. Sometimes the threat is all it takes. How social are your parents? If their reputation is important to them, start trashing it. Tell any and all who know them what they did. Selfish people like that will want to save their own asses and may tell you what you need to know to get your cat back. Good luck. I hope it works out for you.", "NTA. Tell them to give you the buyer\u2019s info or you\u2019ll file a police report for theft. I would also go NC until they got my cat back and apologized.

And a grown-up child lives on his own, responsible for his own pets, meals, schedule etc. Why give up son's property for 'not liking it'?", "Tell them you\u2019ll com back if they tell you where your cat is, get the cat back, and then\u2026just don\u2019t go back.

But i would take even more drastic measures. \n\nI\u2019d get myself proof of ownership over the cat, vet bills, paid by you etc. Then report your parents to the police. Tell them you owned the cat, here is the proof of ownership, my parents went behind my back and sold the cat. I want them charged for it and my cat returned", "Nta I would have filed a police report for thief. Then send it to facebook marketplace place to report them for selling stolen pets. Even though the charges wouldn\u2019t really lead anywhere at least they might get banned from marketplace", "NTA- but contact your animal shelters because I\u2019ve seen many cases where ppl say they sold it to \u201csomeone\u201d but really took them to the shelter", "NTA. This isn't about valuing a cat more than your relationship with your parents. This is about having reasonable boundaries. They committed a terrible act of abuse when they sold your beloved pet, for no reason other than cruelty. Not wanting to be treated so cruelly does not mean you are somehow valuing a cat more highly than your relationship with your parents. It is your parents who destroyed the relationship and don't value your safety or mental health. You would be well justified in going no contact if they aren't willing to make this right. And even if they do make it right and get back the cat for you, acknowledging that they were wrong to do you harm in this way, you should be very hesitant to ever trust them again. Moving out is necessary for your personal safety and they have no right to be offended. They have lost your trust and any right they might have had to complain. I wonder if it's possible to guess their Facebook password and track down this buyer. No self respecting cat person would keep a stolen animal.
