You are not valuing your cat the same as family members.  THEY didn't value YOU enough to care about your feelings.  They are horrible people, and you deserve better than that from people who say they love you.\n\nPersonally, I would have stayed an extra day at home though, pulled up their FB accounts on their computers, and found out where they gave my cat.  Usually people don't buy older cats.  Shelters are full of them for free.  They likely gave your cat away, and the person who took him may be willing to hear you out.  Or take a little payment for Milo themselves.\n\nI would also suggest contacting shelters.  They may have literally just dropped him at one.", "NTA. If I were in your position, my parents would be dead to me.\n\nFirst, animals are considered property. So you owned the cat, and your parents took it without consent and sold it. It wasn't Theirs to sell. There's a word for that. Theft.\n\nSecond, they waited specifically until you couldn't do anything about it, and sold the cat knowing how it would hurt you. And then refusing to give you the buyer's information so you can't even try and make some kind of alternate plans? There's a word for that as well. Evil.\n\nNot only would I never speak to my parents again. I would consider them enemies.\n\nAs a side note, you might want to try and look into things. There's a good possibility they didn't sell it at all. They may have just killed it or went drop it off somewhere.", "NTA at all. I saw a similar post not that long ago but it was the boyfriend/husband who got rid of the cat. I'm sorry that they did that to you. I would be devestated. \n\nPets>family", "NTA. My pets are my fur babies. Long story short, my mother did something similar to line her own pockets. I didn't speak to her for years. And if I'm honest, I haven't forgiven her for that either. Ugh. I am so mad on your behalf!", "NTA.\nParents are the assholes for selling your cat without your consent, and siblings are assholes for saying you\u2019re terrible for leaving.", "NTA. So, we know what your siblings think. What about your parents, are they happy now?", "NTA. You are better off without heartless, cruel people, even if they share your DNA Also, call local animal control and some shelters. They might have even just thrown him outside.\nThat sounds like a lie about selling the cat, since there are so many in shelters.", "NTA!!!!!!!!! I would literally never speak to them again and anyone that supports them can go too!!", "NTA Sorry about Milo dude.", "Nta", "NTA. I have also lost my baby (cat) while going through a divorce. My ex did something with her and he insists that he did not. Try putting up a \"lost pet\" notice on Facebook and on your local Humane Society website. It might take a while, you might not get results, but it won't hurt to try.", "INFO: How old are you? Who cared for and paid for the cat? Did they have a reason other than not liking it (e.g. did they say \"If that cat pisses on my bed one more time I'm getting rid of it\" ?).", "Nta", "NTA. Also put them in a terrible nursing home someday and just walk away.", "they stole your best friend \u2026 you deserve space to grieve imo", "NTA, call the local animal shelters.", "NTA, I'd rage beyond all belief. I don't care if it's \"just a cat\" that is so disrespectful and self centered. This isn't a teddy bear or a dresser, it's a living being. I would try to track down where he went and explain the situation and see if you can have him back.", "NTA your parents\u2019 behavior is DISGUSTING. I would never be able to forgive such a thing. I\u2019d go full no contact, this is horrible and the fact two people could agree on this is disturbing.\n\nI\u2019d honestly tell them that, unless they give you the buyers info, you are no longer in contact or family.", "INFO\n\nWho was responsible for the cat? Litterbox? Food? Messes?\n\nI'm not aware of the Facebook marketplace value of a cat. Was this a valuable breed of cat?  How much could they reasonably have received for the cat?\n\nWhy did your parents not like the cat?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Did they have valid concerns about keeping the cat?  Who was responsible for the cat?  Who cleaned the litter box, took him to the vet, bought his food?  Was he destructive, did he tear up carpet, destroy furniture/curtains, did he spray or go outside the litter box?\n\n\nParents are AHs for giving the cat away while you were at work.  If they wanted the cat out of their house, then they should have told *you* to figure that out.\n\nOP is an AH for keeping Milo in a house that he knew was not welcoming for Milo, where he knew there was a chance of this happening, and only waiting until *after* the fact to move out.", "NTA. Terrible.", "NTA. Your parents are so cruel. IMO you should shake them on FB or You should file a police report because they stole and then sold your cat.  Block your siblings for a while too because they sound as bad as your parents.", "Tell your siblings that your parents are damn skippy lucky you didn't torch the house on your way out the door.\n\nNTA x Infinity", "BTA, call the cops and file a police report against your parents. If you can't do that, then take something of very sentimental value to them maybe a wedding band. Don't admit to having it but say if you get your cat back maybe the universe will reunite them with their wedding band.", "Legally, pets are considered property. You are an adult. Your parents had no right to sell your cat without your permission. They stole it. They committed a crime. Report them to the police -- that's your best shot at getting them to cough up the identity of the buyer and get your cat back.\n\nNTA", "Nta. They're overstepping their boundaries. But just to make sure, having a cat in the house makes the house smelly and filled with furs everywhere.  Does that cause them to hate the cat? If so, you shouldn't keep the cat if you're not taking care of it properly. Or better if you own a cat when you own your own place. Taking care of a cat is a huge responsibility.  I know I love cats. I have lots of cats. But I hate how some people who has cat don't really take responsibility when the cat are peeing and pooing everywhere and caused the house to be so stinky.", "Yeah I could never see them the same again. I would no longer have parents it\u2019s done. This level of cruel should not ever be forgiven", "This comment is full of hatred.", "I should add too even if your current living situation doesn't allow for it, I'd still try to get him back and then find him a new home/temp situation on your terms somewhere you trust so you at least know he's safe/well taken care of. I couldn't live knowing one of my pets might be in a bad situation out of my control. It would eat me up to no end.", "Yes, definitely need more info. How did OP get the cat in the first place? Did the parents adopt it, or did OP? And if OP adopted it, did they get the parent's permission?\n\nI recently took in my daughter's cat, and it has been a *huge* annoyance (the one small cat causes way more trouble than the 3 medium sized dogs who already live here). I like animals so I am doing my best to make it work, but I can understand if a parent who does not like pets in the first place got dumped with the responsibility of one, they'd rehome it."]}
