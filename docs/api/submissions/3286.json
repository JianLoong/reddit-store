She didn't come strutting in wearing it, she spilled food on herself and this was her only resort.  The Ceremony was over and I assume the pictures were taken... as well i'm sure everyone knew she had spilled food on herself so it literally did no harm.

Wearing white is wrong, but on the other hand two broken wrists is going to limit her options.\n\nBut everyone knows that wearing white at a wedding is a giant faux pas.\n\nA common solution I see to the wearing white thing is to get the MOH or a bridesmaid to 'accidentally' spill red wine on the MIL. And its always the MIL.\n\nThe funniest solution ive seen was where the bride knew in advance that the MIL and all her SILs were going to all wear white wedding dresses out of spite.

Yes, MIL shouldn't have to wear a food stained dress.\n\nBut who packs an emergency *white* cocktail dress for a wedding?

Or even a pant suit?\n\nAnd if a white dress was literally the only emergency option available because it's the only outfit that accommodates the broken wrists and there's no time to go shopping/order anything (fair), you give the bride and groom a heads up that this will potentially happen and why.
