Your MIL didn't deliberately wear white to disrupt your big day, just due to unfortunate circumstances largely beyond her control. She did her best to take her misfortune in stride and be there for you and your husband.  You could and should have done likewise for her.", "I personally think this is stupid petty. People are going to your wedding for you, the idea a white cocktail dress would upstage you is absurd. If we are going to go by traditional values, what color was your dress and were you a virgin?

What the actual hell???\nThis literally made me sick. \n\n\nAnd this bullshit about you being uncomfortable because she was wearing a white dress? SERIOUSLY!!?? Absolutely shut the hell up!  Uncomfortable. No you wanted all eyes on you and that is it. \n You didn't care about anything but yourself here.

Family coping with a difficult and painful experience like two broken wrists trumps wedding etiquette rules.\n\nAlso, you say that she spilled on herself at the reception... so after the wedding ceremony?

Even if the wedding ceremony wasn't over with, you would still be the AH. MIL had no intention of ill-will; otherwise she would have changed before the spill.

She didn\u2019t to that on purpose. \n\nShe didn\u2019t humiliate herself by spilling on her dress the day before on purpose.\n\nYou were being petty.

She didn't come strutting in wearing it, she spilled food on herself and this was her only resort.  The Ceremony was over and I assume the pictures were taken... as well i'm sure everyone knew she had spilled food on herself so it literally did no harm.

Wearing white is wrong, but on the other hand two broken wrists is going to limit her options.\n\nBut everyone knows that wearing white at a wedding is a giant faux pas.\n\nA common solution I see to the wearing white thing is to get the MOH or a bridesmaid to 'accidentally' spill red wine on the MIL. And its always the MIL.\n\nThe funniest solution ive seen was where the bride knew in advance that the MIL and all her SILs were going to all wear white wedding dresses out of spite.

She broke her wrists, and still came to your wedding while dealing with it and you\u2019re harping about a dress. Grow TF up. I\u2019d likely never speak to you again because I hold grudges.", "YTA.\n\nLet me put this in a little perspective. Imagine you go to a wedding and your period comes, and your dress gets stained.

Yes, MIL shouldn't have to wear a food stained dress.\n\nBut who packs an emergency *white* cocktail dress for a wedding?

Like the little black one we all know you have because it's been touted as a staple since the days of Coco Chanel?  Or even a pant suit?\n\nAnd if a white dress was literally the only emergency option available because it's the only outfit that accommodates the broken wrists and there's no time to go shopping/order anything (fair), you give the bride and groom a heads up that this will potentially happen and why.
