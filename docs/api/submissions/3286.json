How is that trying to take the attention from you?", "YTA.  She didn't wear white on purpose.  She had a legitimate accident.

Would you kick out your mother? \nWedding is about celebrating love and not about colors of people\u2019s dresses.", "YTA. Your MIL didn\u2019t wear the dress to upstage you; it was the only dress available. There is no rule of etiquette that says only the bride can wear white.

Yes, you were a huge AH.", "YTA. Both of her wrists were literally broken, and you wanted her to walk around and be embarrassed with food on her clothes?

Your MIL didn't deliberately wear white to disrupt your big day, just due to unfortunate circumstances largely beyond her control. She did her best to take her misfortune in stride and be there for you and your husband.  You could and should have done likewise for her.", "I personally think this is stupid petty. People are going to your wedding for you, the idea a white cocktail dress would upstage you is absurd. If we are going to go by traditional values, what color was your dress and were you a virgin?

This is sickening.\nEvery time I see someone posting about a wedding where colors are demanded there is always going to be drama. \nBut what you did was absolutely cold hearted!!!!And your husband was on your side? What the actual hell???\nThis literally made me sick. \n\n\nAnd this bullshit about you being uncomfortable because she was wearing a white dress? SERIOUSLY!!?? Absolutely shut the hell up!  Uncomfortable. No you wanted all eyes on you and that is it. \n You didn't care about anything but yourself here.

And to go out of your way to say what you did and make her feel bad with her injury is despicable. \n\nThis entire post is sad.

And what incredibly rude and disrespectful behavior against the mother of your \u201cAmazing\u201d husband.  I don\u2019t understand how he allowed you to ruin the opportunity.

Family coping with a difficult and painful experience like two broken wrists trumps wedding etiquette rules.\n\nAlso, you say that she spilled on herself at the reception... so after the wedding ceremony? By the time people are eating at the reception, most of the important formal photos, etc. are done, you're already married, and now you're just celebrating.

She didn\u2019t to that on purpose. \n\nShe didn\u2019t humiliate herself by spilling on her dress the day before on purpose.\n\nYou were being petty.

It was a white dress or stained  or something inappropriate/not dressy enough.

She didn't come strutting in wearing it, she spilled food on herself and this was her only resort.  The Ceremony was over and I assume the pictures were taken... as well i'm sure everyone knew she had spilled food on herself so it literally did no harm.

I feel bad for your husband to boot.", "YTA - this was not done for a petty reason, she had a hard time eating because of broken bones.  It is not like she did it because she hates you.  You really need to apologize.", "You owe your MIL a huge apology and you know why. YTA.", "YTA\n\nShe has broken hands and stained her dress and you want her to walk around in a dirty dress because she only had a white spare? \n\nIt's not like she did it intentionally! You are behaving cold and recless. It was just after dinner.", "Not sure what to judge here. Wearing white is wrong, but on the other hand two broken wrists is going to limit her options.\n\nBut everyone knows that wearing white at a wedding is a giant faux pas.\n\nA common solution I see to the wearing white thing is to get the MOH or a bridesmaid to 'accidentally' spill red wine on the MIL. And its always the MIL.\n\nThe funniest solution ive seen was where the bride knew in advance that the MIL and all her SILs were going to all wear white wedding dresses out of spite. Her solution was to wear purple herself and have the invites tell all the other guests to wear a wedding dress.\n\nMIL and SILs turned up to find they didnt stand out at all. Noone batted an eyelid.

She didn't wear white on purpose. What difference would it have made? I hope you got some pretty pictures out of the deal.

You\u2019re sure off yo a horrible start with the family. She had 2 broken wrists, only one other dress to wear, yet you had to go bridezilla and make her miss her son\u2019s wedding?

She broke her wrists, and still came to your wedding while dealing with it and you\u2019re harping about a dress. Grow TF up.

Yes, MIL shouldn't have to wear a food stained dress.\n\nBut who packs an emergency *white* cocktail dress for a wedding? If you've had the forethought that maybe you should have one (accidents do happen, especially with injuries), shouldn't you have the forethought to pack an appropriate emergency dress? Like the little black one we all know you have because it's been touted as a staple since the days of Coco Chanel?  Or even a pant suit?\n\nAnd if a white dress was literally the only emergency option available because it's the only outfit that accommodates the broken wrists and there's no time to go shopping/order anything (fair), you give the bride and groom a heads up that this will potentially happen and why. Otherwise it's going to be read as you making a statement of disrespect for the bride because of our cultural connotations around white at weddings.", "NTA. Your MIL bringing a white dress as her back up (or to be worn at *any* of the pre-wedding parties) was a deliberate choice. Good for your husband standing up to her.\n\nETA: my mil wanted to wear a cream lace dress to our wedding and when i expressed my discomfort, she said \u201cpippa wore white to william and kates wedding. if it\u2019s good enough for princess kate, it should be good enough for you.\u201d I just said \u201ci\u2019m not princess kate\u201d and walked away.", "YTA\n\nOMG you sound thoughtless and heartless", "I was going to go with ESH.. but after typing out my reasoning I started thinking why couldn\u2019t she wear other clothes she had? Jeans and a top. It would\u2019ve been less of a fuss to wear clean casual clothes than a white dress.
