There is one other director (let's call her Janice) who started less than one month ago and is still doing training.  We work full time and all other employees are part time.  Part-time employees are spread throughout the office at various tables and Janice has a cubicle like space with a desk and a desktop computer that is amongst the part-time staff.  That's just how our office is set up.  There is only one formal office and that's where my desk is.\n\nWe keep files, information, copies, etc. in my office and Janice comes and goes to get things she needs.  I typically keep my door open unless I am in a meeting.\n\nYesterday I took the day off and upon getting in today, I noticed some crumbs on my laptop keyboard.  I later noticed some files in my download folder and checked the internet history to confirm that she had used my computer.  It showed her email so I know it was her.  Everything was work related- nothing personal or inappropriate.\n\nIt bothered me however because I did not give her the password to my computer.  I have never given it to anyone, not even the previous director who worked there for two years before Janice started.  I also just couldn't understand why she would use my computer when she has one.\n\nI asked her, saying, \"hey, did you use my computer yesterday?\" Janice: \"Yes.\" Me: \"oh, okay, um, why?\"  Janice: blew up at me.  Said I offended her for asking.  Said she didn't realize it was a personal computer.  Said she didn't understand why I had an office but she didn't if we're both directors (there's only one office, it's a weird layout.  I don't like the layout but I have no control over it).  \n\nI tried explaining that yes it's a work computer but it's my work station, my desk, etc.  I have no problem if she needs to use the space for a conference when the time comes (remember she is still in training and is not currently holding meetings).  She couldn't understand the concept of having a desk or computer that while is company owned, is not common space to use.\n\nShe ended up leaving in a fit and said we would continue the conversation with a meeting with our boss.

Wow that was an extreme overreaction on her part. Update us on the talk with your boss please.  But it certainly sounds like she just wanted to use your office because she's jealous you have one.\n\nI suggest you take the laptop and lock it on a drawer or take it home. Those things are too easy to break out of a docking station -even if locked in one. Our security people did not like us leaving them on the desks when we left for the day, no matter how they were \"locked\".", "NTA\n\nI suggest you change your password.

If not, how did she get in and how do you have visibility of her activity?", "NTA, especially for the crumbs.  I'd be concerned how she got the password.

This isn\u2019t a situation where you\u2019re being nice to someone, it\u2019s a situation where you\u2019ve exposed yourself as a security breach.\n\nHer having your password without you ever sharing/providing it is a huge red flag.", "NTA. It's literally your computer and she didn't ask for permission to use your device for anything. She also somehow figured out your password, which may mean that she might have been watching you in your office prior to try and get your password, because there's literally no way she could've gotten it legitimately. Furthermore, you aren't responsible for the office being built like crap, and given that she's very new to the position she is endangering her entire position over something that is entirely her fault. Honestly, I hope she does get in serious trouble for it, she deserves it for using your stuff without permission and probably spying on you to get into your laptop. Given that she switched a bunch of stuff over to her things (such as her email) she also could have seen plenty of stuff on your computer that she had no right to see, and who knows if she went poking through your personal information. It's a breach of privacy and should be taken extremely seriously.", "NTA - HOW did she get your password to log into YOUR work computer?\n\nShe either WATCHED as you typed it in once and memorized it OR did she get your Boss or IT dept to unlock it for her?\n\nAnd did I read that right? She downloaded some of your files??\n\nHER REACTION tells me everything I need to know about her\n\nShe is sneaky and untrustworthy \n\nShe never once ASKED if she could use YOUR computer or your desk when you weren\u2019t there\n\nShe intentionally ATE food at your desk getting crumbs in the keyboard and purposely left a mess\n\nShe is new - I don\u2019t care that she has the same title as you - that doesn\u2019t allow her to take over your area and downloading sensitive files without your knowledge or consent\n\nShe is DEFINITELY going to try to force your Boss to make YOUR office area a \u201cshared\u201d area with her \n\n& she will try to get you fired by acting \u201cthe victim\u201d. She will be going to your boss with false accusations against you to cover up her Toxic behavior \n\nand try to manipulate you into quitting so SHE can be YOU\n\nShe has decided that SHE wants what YOU have\n\nI\u2019m guessing that she acted the same way at all her previous jobs\n\nMaybe find out about that", "Info: why does she have your password? Further: does your company not hold you personally responsible for protecting your password? \n\nNow, I\u2019ve had a reception job where we could all log in to the shared computer at the disabled window (desk with a seat, not standing) but logging in as another user wouldn\u2019t change anyone else\u2019s search history. This was 20 years ago at a rural government office so the tech has been in use for forever. \n\nI do get office frustration. My company has embraced WFH and is leasing out part of the building and moved a lot of us to other floors. People who already had offices got to keep them but my boss is in a tiny cubicle - not even a manager double. He\u2019s a VP and directors get offices they rarely use. \n\nPersonally I am only in a few days a month so I got a wireless keyboard and keep it in a locked drawer. Other people use my cubicle if they need to come in for a meeting and I\u2019m not there, but no crumbs.", "NTA and you would get blamed for any monkey business that went on on that computer by her", "NTA. It's the fact that she's never used your computer before or asked you about it and then blew up after it, like she was doing a DARVO on you. You don't control how the office is laid out, or where she uses her computer. It's not YOUR fault that she's new and has a space that is out with the others. You know full well that she took your day off as a moment to sit in the office and pretend like she was the one in charge. She was stretching her legs into your pants. She wants your position, which is why she's also escalating it to your boss. Which should happen anyway, because the question of 'Why did she use my password for my computer without my permission, how did she get it, and why didn't she at least call and ask before just assuming she could use it' needs to be answered. \n\nShe's the new kid on the block and she's already gunning for your job. And frankly, I wouldn't appreciate someone getting called out for someone doing a DARVO with it right off the bat. Change your password.", "ESH. It\u2019s not your personal office if it also contains items that are necessary for Janice to do her job. It is a communal space which contains a desk that you use. It **is** unfair that Janice has the same title as you and needs to access the items inside the office but is not allowed to sit in the office. If I were Janice I would also probably conclude that it was okay to sit in the office when you are out, especially if she is able to access all of her emails and her necessary items from that computer. \n\nRemember, Janice is brand new. If she doesn\u2019t know that she\u2019s not allowed to do certain things, it\u2019s because you haven\u2019t trained her on them. Your office is nonstandard so you can\u2019t expect her to magically know how things work. **She\u2019s right** that it\u2019s confusing for you to have a \u201cprivate\u201d space in a not private office, because it doesn\u2019t make sense\u2014you\u2019ve just been working there so long you\u2019re used to it. \n\nYou should have approached her with curiosity instead of accusation. Janice overreacted, but you\u2019re the person with more power here, so you should have been able to handle this situation in a more mature way. I\u2019m only going ESH because she raised her voice; you\u2019re YTA for all the rest of it.", "NTA for asking why she used the computer you normally use but YTA for pretending to not understand her reason for using the computer or the response.\n\nYou two are equal in title, and yet you have the extra perk of a private office.  Even though you have a private office that she never tries to use while you're there but you also get mad when she uses it when you aren't there. \n\nYou're being unreasonable.  You weren't using it. You confirmed she was only using it for work related things, so you had no real reason to question why she was using it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
