Either way if he's going to be a regular driver insurance *needs* to know. \n\nI'm in Texas as well, I know it's hot. 105 today and for the foreseeable future. But I would check to see how much it is to fix his a/c rather than letting him drive your car forever.", "But why can't he either fix his Ac or pay to be on your insurance?", "Then you should is this opportunity to break up with him. You do not share similar values. You do not respect him. You do not want to go out of your way to assist him. There is no reason for you two to be together.", "You should not, he is not your responsibility, you don't live together and he is not good with money, he have had more than 1 year to save and repair his car and has chosen not to do it, that's on him, he doesn't have enough money to fix his own damn car, what makes you think that if anything happens to your car he would pay for it? Let me repeat it HE IS NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY! NTA.", "YW. Ultimately the decision is up to you. Though I think the added context of him not saving up for it in a year's time doesn't make him look too good. With this info, it now seems like he isn't too concerned about it. In which case, why should you be? \nBut if you plan to stay with him and progress the relationship, he'll need to improve his budgeting. Having a partner who can't see the big picture and act accordingly is a partner not worth having. \n\nI wish you luck whatever you choose.", "A year together isn\u2019t long enough to establish the trust of what happens if he gets into an accident and can\u2019t afford to make you whole.", "I never understood that of the USA, in my country you insure a car, and every single driver with a valid drivers license would be covered", "Depends on the state", "But you\u2019re allowed to drive someone else\u2019s car. In my state, I know that if both the owner and the driver have insurance, *someone* will pay in this situation. I thought it was the driver\u2019s policy, but it might be the owner\u2019s", "Depends on that state", "That's where I have been while reading all of these NTA comments. I strongly believe if the genders were swapped, the judgement would be too.", "OP please take this advice.\n\nHe had a year to figure this out.\n\nYou should give a think about how he handles money.  You plan ahead and he doesn't.  Financial incompatibility doesn't lend itself to a smooth relationship.\n\nDon't lend him the car.  Also he's being passive aggressive.  He's not even mature enough to point blank ask.  This is yet another red flag.", "Depends on the jurisdiction.  Some places insurance follows the driver, some follow the vehicle."]}
