Typically if you reside in the same house, and it was reported as such, he would be an excluded driver. If he wrecks your car, even if he was not at fault, and he is an excluded driver your insurance WILL NOT cover that accident. At all. No consideration. \n\nAlso that is frankly a lot of wear and tear on the vehicle, the mileage will depreciate the value significantly, likely higher than the cost to repair his own AC.", "NTA do not ever let anyone who is not on your insurance drive your car. You could wind up with no car and the boyfriend who can\u2019t afford to fix his a/c also can\u2019t afford to buy you a new car.", "NTA. He has a car, and it's unfortunate that the A/C doesn't work, but that isn't your problem. Riding with the windows down is bearable, even in the heat (coming from someone in Oklahoma, where the heat is also fucking terrible). It's your car and you have no obligation to allow anyone else to use it routinely, especially if that person is not covered by your insurance.\n\nEDIT: if your partner is openly calling you selfish, maybe it's time to reconsider your relationship.", "Nta. I wouldn\u2019t be comfortable with that either. I would let him use it IF it was for a sort period of time such as when it\u2019s in the shop getting fixed. But not for an indeterminable amount of time and not without him on the insurance.", "Nta, I live in Houston. Roll down the windows and sweat a bit. But I wouldn\u2019t let anyone not on my insurance drive due to liability reasons.", "NTA\n\nWhy not add him to your insurance and he can pay the increase for the short term until he can fix his AC? I mean that seems like a reasonable compromise if it's a short term situation.", "NTA, borrowing it once while his car is in the shop having the AC repaired is one thing, borrowing it unlimitedly is another. Also you are right to be concerned about your insurance and the wear and tear.", "NAH - He hasn't asked, so there's nothing to judge. Though I don't think ignoring \"hints\" is wise - just address it and be done with it. Being previously called selfish doesn't seem to be a factor here at this time. If he has full coverage on his car (I assume he doesn't) that's what would cover your car if he was driving it - that's just how insurance policies work. Also, it's always hot in TX during the summer. This is something he should have known was coming and been saving to repair.", "NTA. It\u2019s your car. By your post, I don\u2019t know if your BF would offer to pay for gas & wear and tear on your car. And what if he gets into an accident? Would insurance cover him? And whose insurance?\n\nBesides, it\u2019s not like he can\u2019t get to work. He has a car, it just isn\u2019t comfortable, and I can definitely sympathize in that heat. \n\nAnd there is one more thing: heavily implying is vastly different than just asking.", "NTA. He\u2019s already called you selfish before, that\u2019s a big red flag. \n\nHe can\u2019t afford to fix his a/c, what happens if he damages your car?

I live in Texas and we have been under a heat advisory for weeks. It is dangerously hot here. Insurance can cover you no matter what car you are driving that is why I never buy the supplemental insurance when renting a car.

Or any other compromise/ agreement y'all could come up with)\n\nI'm in TX, too, and my a/c  went out a few weeks ago. I had an appt to put it in the shop at the end of the week.  However,  one day before,  I was driving home and...a major traffic accident. I mean....highway closed and waiting for the LifeFlight Helicopter to come and land on the highway closed. I thought I was going to die after an hour of just sitting there.  I was so dizzy and confused and felt so sick.  (Just by chance,  a nurse was next to me, gave me water,  and put me in her car.) \n\nIt won't kill him to drive without a/c, but  I hope he doesn't come across any prolonged traffic delays!", "Honestly ask yourself how would you feel if the shoe was on the other foot? Would you drive in the stifling heat and walk into your office sweaty everyday thinking Damn I need to get my A/C fixed or Damn my own bf really watches me go through this and doesn't try to help? As long as you wouldn't be upset that he refused to help you if the tables were turned, you're in the clear. \n\nBut if you'd be upset at him for treating the situation as you are, doesn't seem like much of a partnership. \n\nIf you want to help him but don't want him to use your car, maybe help him a bit with the cost of the repair or even help him create a better budget so it can be fixed faster.\n\nAlso I've been in his situation. I'm from the south as well and I can promise you he's going through pure hell. No one here saying \"he'll be alright\" would trade places with him for even five minutes.", "What\u2019s easier for you. Loaning money to get his ac fixed or loaning him your car. Also does he not have anyone else to rely on or credit cards to put the fix on? It\u2019s not your responsibility to be the responsible one.

Why not ask him to help you make sure your insurance covers other drivers, or suggest that you can start by letting him he could borrow it for a trial period.
