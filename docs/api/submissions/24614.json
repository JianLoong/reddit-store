{"id": 24614, "submission_id": "15qp4s9", "title": "AITA for taking my parasol out at a barbecue against my girlfriend's wishes?", "selftext": "With how hot it has been in my home state lately, I [25M] recently purchased a parasol which I use frequently. I wilt in high heat and humidity, but it has been a lifesaver. I've stayed cool and haven't gotten sunburned once this summer.\n\nThe issue is that every time I take out my parasol, my girlfriend Jenn [24F] groans audibly. She hates it. She says it makes me look like a \"wimp.\" In response, I have made clear that if she doesn't like it, she's free to walk a few steps ahead of me when we're in public. She has taken me up on this frequently.\n\nNow, a few weeks ago, I was invited to a barbecue at her folks' house to meet her family for the first time. The day of the barbecue was yesterday. In the morning, Jenn sat me down and told me that under no circumstance was I to take out my parasol. She reiterated this point multiple times. She didn't even want me to bring it but folded when I said I would just use it to walk to the car. \n\nWe got to the barbecue and everything was going fine. I met her mother, father, and brothers. Soon after the barbecue started, though, I realized that although everyone was friendly, it wasn't quite my vibe. They offered me a beer multiple times even though I was driving and were extremely boisterous. Think \"guy crushing a beer can on his head.\" The heat was also getting uncomfortable.\n\nAt first, a tree in their yard provided shade, but that didn't last. Eventually I decided I wanted my parasol. I excused myself, an action which Jenn saw and responded to with a panicked look. I mouthed \"bathroom\" to her. Then I walked to the car and retrieved it. I went back outside and opened it up which stopped her father and brothers' conversation. Her father asked what I was holding. I said it was a parasol. He informed me it wasn't going to rain. I told him it was for sun protection. He laughed loudly which got Jenn's attention again. She ran over and first tried to thank me for getting it for her, attempting to pass it off as hers, but I informed them that it was mine. Jenn gave me a look of pure desperation.\n\nHer father began laughing himself silly about it and yelled to his wife about taking him to buy a \"pink frilly one\" at the mall. I didn't get the joke but her brothers found it and the follow up joke of him prancing around with a grill spatula held like an umbrella to be hilarious.\n\nEventually I put it away when it got darker. I thought everything was fine by then as the jokes had ceased. But on our way back to the car, Jenn basically ran ahead of me, not responding to any of my comments. A minute or so after I started driving she shouted at me saying she asked for \"one damn thing\" but I couldn't even do that. She ignored me the rest of the way home. \n\nThat was a few hours ago.

You agreed to go to the event but disregarded the one explicit condition she put on it. It\u2019s clear that she finds it weird and off putting that you use this thing, and she asked you to not use it around her family. You did it anyway.\n\nBut she also sucks. It\u2019s equally clear that you\u2019re so attached to this thing that it\u2019s a major part of your identity, and she hates it. She put you in a position of going to an event you\u2019d probably hate due to lack of shade and took away the one thing that seems to make such things better. Given this interaction I can\u2019t see why she would want to be with you anymore. In 5 years when she gets married, someone will make a joke about Parasol Boy at the reception.\n\nHer family is just a group of dicks for treating a guest like that. They will be the ones making the joke, and it will 100% include an insinuation that you\u2019re gay.\n\nI can\u2019t believe this is real, though. You use the world \u201cparasol\u201d like my toddler uses the word \u201cblankie.\u201d There\u2019s something deeply unsettling about the way you talk about it when coming from an adult.

She shouldnt be ashamed of a parasol, but you shouldnt be deliberately ignoring her requests that you already agreed to and lying about it.

Doesnt add up.", "NTA - Her family has the idea that it is not manly and it sounds like it is an idea that she shares given her embarrassment of it. The joke her father was making about getting a pink frilly one and prancing with the spatula was that they believed it was a girly accessory instead of a utilitarian tool for creating shade. They were very rudely making fun of you to your face and that should have been when your girlfriend stepped in and told them to cut it out.", "NTA but I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s embarrassed that it looks feminine and knew her family would mock both you & her about it. Sounds like there could be some toxic masculinity in her family but congrats on not being bothered & just doing what was best for you.", "Yta\nYou completely disregarded her wishes just to make a backwards statement. I don't believe you \"wilt\" in the sun and they make sunscreen. You're just intentionally trying to draw attention to yourself and you clearly don't care what kinda attention it is.

Jenn has no business asking you to sacrifice your comfort and well being for her notions of what is appropriate male behavior.  If she finds this so embarrassing, she should date someone else.  And let's not talk about her family's implicit homophobia by how they mocked you.", "NTA. Nothing manly about skin cancer!", "YTA for agreeing to going under that condition then doing it anyway. If you weren't committed to not using it, then you should have declined the BBQ. And you knew damn well you were going to use it at the BBQ that's why you apparently had to take it to the car (ridiculous you'd need it for such a short walk). You also lied when you mouthed bathroom at her. She's going to leave you.", "YTA, she asked you to do 1 thing. I don\u2019t agree with her asking you to do that but still, you agreed.", "YTA. Well she did ask nicely and you consented and lied about not using it. Regardless of the health benemfits to you. You could have asked to come inside the house instead if it\u2019s too hot for you by making excuses or even use a bath towel to cover yourself .

Luckily, no one I know has a problem with it. It\u2019s just another form of sun safety.\n\nYour girlfriend is embarrassed by what happened at the barbecue - but the most embarrassing behaviour wasn\u2019t you taking out your parasol, it was the reaction - it sounded bizarre and over the top.", "Slip, slop, slap. You can do those things without embarrassing your girlfriend and drawing attention to yourself. YTA", "I hope you aren't too invested in the relationship as it is not long for this world. YTA, you could have - just this once - respected her request. But you didn't want to do that and even lied to her when you mouthed \"bathroom\".

First off, protecting yourself from the sun is a serious matter, skin cancer is no fucking joke and the heat\u2019s been brutal with global warming. Second of all, your gf\u2019s family\u2019s misogynistic and immature views are not your responsibility. She should be standing up for you, especially when it comes to something so stupid and small. I would be furious if my family mocked my husband in any capacity, it would be disrespectful both to my partner and me. At the very least, since you seem to not care what they think, your gf could suck it up. It seems like she\u2019s the only one truly upset in this situation.

A hat is actually better protection than a parasol anyway", "YTA , aside of if it makes you a wimp or not, she made you a request and you lied accepting\n\nIf you didn't intend on following her request u should've just not accepted and not go, it doesn't matter if this is sexist or not, u made a promise and then broke it", "There are a lot of comments about Asians using parasols. I\u2019m from an Asian country, I don\u2019t see them here regularly. It\u2019s usually the snooty, i like that I look like a member of the Cullen family type people who use parasols. \n\nThat aside, you knew it was going to cause problems.

You have different vibes, man.", "NTA, it's protection from getting all kinds of nasty stuff. She's an AH for even mocking you with it, and so is het family. I for one hate the sun and will get sun stroke. I have to resort to things like hats and parasols to not get burned. If she thinks looks are more important then health, she's clearly not mature.

You should have been honest up front, and not go behind her back.", "NTA - Also, get away from that family as fast as you can, and forget you ever knew them, because I think this is only the beginning of a whoooole string of even *more* unreasonable demands, just to have their rather ugly kind of fun.

The question is, why is she hung up on this even before the visit ?  \n\nBe glad you took care of yourself.  You learned things. You see her and her family more clearly now.  Do you want your life rules to involve the two of you always managing yourselves so as to avoid bullying by her family?   for that matter do you want your life ruled by her being embarrassed at anything you ever do that doesn\u2019t fall within what she thinks are acceptable parameters?  She and they are inside the box people.  You are not.  There nothing wrong with either except when one type cannot simply accept the other and move on, and instead demands the other hide who they are and bullies them.   \n\nThis is who they are and this is how they\u2019ve made her.  She might eventually recognise they are toxic and they have given her such a fear of other peoples judgement that she wants to limit herself and you in this way.  She might try to recover from her toxic upbringing.  She may never be an outside the box person but she could learn to walk beside you getting sunburnt instead of in the shade with you and not demand you give up your shade and choose sunburn.    Or she might not do so and carry on always trying to make sure she and you and any kids you may have fit exactly into the box of \u2018normal\u2019  that her family won\u2019t make fun of and she need have no fear of random strangers giving funny looks to. (warning, there is nothing her family can\u2019t find a reason to harass you or her over and the chances are good  on any given day that a random stranger will give you a side eye for no reason.) \n\n\nAs an old person I suggest limiting how long you stick around waiting for her to accept you instead of trying to make you fit into the box she wants you in.   Cooperation and adjustments are a thing couples do, but her family seem pretty rigid and she is like them.  Find someone who realises a parasol is useful and has a family that thinks it\u2019s a clever solution even if she/they would never use one .  Because that parasol is just an example of you thinking in terms of what works as opposed to worrying about what other people think.  It harms no one if you use it in public and harmed no one at the gathering.   There\u2019s no reason for her to be that bothered about it and even less reason for them to bully you over it.  But she is a oerson who  us rules by the imaginary judgement of others and the actual judgement of her family over things that don\u2019t matter.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

I say this as a person with fishbelly white skin and the heat tolerance of a Husky. Add a handheld fan if needed for a breeze, since you\u2019ll have a free hand from not carrying around a freaking parasol.

I don't really get the shaming and many people say that Opie was seeking attention but like he literally went to a tree to look for shade but it didn't work and he went to go and get the parasol. \n\nHonestly the only thing that nipped me was that he lied by saying he was going to the bathroom and that I can say he was a bit wrong or totally wrong but everything else it was more like the Dad and brothers were basically making fun of him and if anyone should be embarrassed it should be op because like being safe is nothing to be seen as less manly. \n\nAll I can say is that Opie yeah a bit of the a-hole but I would say his girlfriend was more of the a-hole as well as her family for making jokes even if it was light-hearted I guess it might have given Opie's girlfriend the impression that the men are supposed to be more tougher and supposed to take on the sun directly and in turn can be sort of toxic because it is more foolish to stay under blistering hot sun and not protect yourself whether it be by sunblock or even finding shade that works entirely.
