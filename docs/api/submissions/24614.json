{"id": 24614, "submission_id": "15qp4s9", "title": "AITA for taking my parasol out at a barbecue against my girlfriend's wishes?", "selftext": "With how hot it has been in my home state lately, I [25M] recently purchased a parasol which I use frequently. I wilt in high heat and humidity, but it has been a lifesaver. I've stayed cool and haven't gotten sunburned once this summer.\n\nThe issue is that every time I take out my parasol, my girlfriend Jenn [24F] groans audibly. She hates it. She says it makes me look like a \"wimp.\" In response, I have made clear that if she doesn't like it, she's free to walk a few steps ahead of me when we're in public. She has taken me up on this frequently.\n\nNow, a few weeks ago, I was invited to a barbecue at her folks' house to meet her family for the first time. The day of the barbecue was yesterday. In the morning, Jenn sat me down and told me that under no circumstance was I to take out my parasol. She reiterated this point multiple times. She didn't even want me to bring it but folded when I said I would just use it to walk to the car. \n\nWe got to the barbecue and everything was going fine. I met her mother, father, and brothers. Soon after the barbecue started, though, I realized that although everyone was friendly, it wasn't quite my vibe. They offered me a beer multiple times even though I was driving and were extremely boisterous. Think \"guy crushing a beer can on his head.\" The heat was also getting uncomfortable.\n\nAt first, a tree in their yard provided shade, but that didn't last. Eventually I decided I wanted my parasol. I excused myself, an action which Jenn saw and responded to with a panicked look. I mouthed \"bathroom\" to her. Then I walked to the car and retrieved it. I went back outside and opened it up which stopped her father and brothers' conversation. Her father asked what I was holding. I said it was a parasol. He informed me it wasn't going to rain. I told him it was for sun protection. He laughed loudly which got Jenn's attention again. She ran over and first tried to thank me for getting it for her, attempting to pass it off as hers, but I informed them that it was mine. Jenn gave me a look of pure desperation.\n\nHer father began laughing himself silly about it and yelled to his wife about taking him to buy a \"pink frilly one\" at the mall. I didn't get the joke but her brothers found it and the follow up joke of him prancing around with a grill spatula held like an umbrella to be hilarious.\n\nEventually I put it away when it got darker. I thought everything was fine by then as the jokes had ceased. But on our way back to the car, Jenn basically ran ahead of me, not responding to any of my comments. A minute or so after I started driving she shouted at me saying she asked for \"one damn thing\" but I couldn't even do that. She ignored me the rest of the way home. \n\nThat was a few hours ago.

It\u2019s equally clear that you\u2019re so attached to this thing that it\u2019s a major part of your identity, and she hates it.

Given this interaction I can\u2019t see why she would want to be with you anymore. In 5 years when she gets married, someone will make a joke about Parasol Boy at the reception.\n\nHer family is just a group of dicks for treating a guest like that. They will be the ones making the joke, and it will 100% include an insinuation that you\u2019re gay.\n\nI can\u2019t believe this is real, though.

The joke her father was making about getting a pink frilly one and prancing with the spatula was that they believed it was a girly accessory instead of a utilitarian tool for creating shade. They were very rudely making fun of you to your face and that should have been when your girlfriend stepped in and told them to cut it out.", "NTA but I\u2019m guessing she\u2019s embarrassed that it looks feminine and knew her family would mock both you & her about it.

I don't believe you \"wilt\" in the sun and they make sunscreen. You're just intentionally trying to draw attention to yourself and you clearly don't care what kinda attention it is.

If you weren't committed to not using it, then you should have declined the BBQ.

Well she did ask nicely and you consented and lied about not using it. Regardless of the health benemfits to you.

Luckily, no one I know has a problem with it. It\u2019s just another form of sun safety.\n\nYour girlfriend is embarrassed by what happened at the barbecue - but the most embarrassing behaviour wasn\u2019t you taking out your parasol, it was the reaction - it sounded bizarre and over the top.", "Slip, slop, slap.

YTA, you could have - just this once - respected her request. But you didn't want to do that and even lied to her when you mouthed \"bathroom\".

First off, protecting yourself from the sun is a serious matter, skin cancer is no fucking joke and the heat\u2019s been brutal with global warming. Second of all, your gf\u2019s family\u2019s misogynistic and immature views are not your responsibility. She should be standing up for you, especially when it comes to something so stupid and small. I would be furious if my family mocked my husband in any capacity, it would be disrespectful both to my partner and me. At the very least, since you seem to not care what they think, your gf could suck it up. It seems like she\u2019s the only one truly upset in this situation.

You should have been honest up front, and not go behind her back.", "NTA - Also, get away from that family as fast as you can, and forget you ever knew them, because I think this is only the beginning of a whoooole string of even *more* unreasonable demands, just to have their rather ugly kind of fun.

The question is, why is she hung up on this even before the visit ?  \n\nBe glad you took care of yourself.  You learned things. You see her and her family more clearly now.  Do you want your life rules to involve the two of you always managing yourselves so as to avoid bullying by her family?   for that matter do you want your life ruled by her being embarrassed at anything you ever do that doesn\u2019t fall within what she thinks are acceptable parameters?  She and they are inside the box people.  You are not.  There nothing wrong with either except when one type cannot simply accept the other and move on, and instead demands the other hide who they are and bullies them.   \n\nThis is who they are and this is how they\u2019ve made her.  She might eventually recognise they are toxic and they have given her such a fear of other peoples judgement that she wants to limit herself and you in this way.  She might try to recover from her toxic upbringing.  She may never be an outside the box person but she could learn to walk beside you getting sunburnt instead of in the shade with you and not demand you give up your shade and choose sunburn.    Or she might not do so and carry on always trying to make sure she and you and any kids you may have fit exactly into the box of \u2018normal\u2019  that her family won\u2019t make fun of and she need have no fear of random strangers giving funny looks to. (warning, there is nothing her family can\u2019t find a reason to harass you or her over and the chances are good  on any given day that a random stranger will give you a side eye for no reason.) \n\n\nAs an old person I suggest limiting how long you stick around waiting for her to accept you instead of trying to make you fit into the box she wants you in.   Cooperation and adjustments are a thing couples do, but her family seem pretty rigid and she is like them.  Find someone who realises a parasol is useful and has a family that thinks it\u2019s a clever solution even if she/they would never use one .  Because that parasol is just an example of you thinking in terms of what works as opposed to worrying about what other people think.  It harms no one if you use it in public and harmed no one at the gathering.   There\u2019s no reason for her to be that bothered about it and even less reason for them to bully you over it.  But she is a oerson who  us rules by the imaginary judgement of others and the actual judgement of her family over things that don\u2019t matter.", "[deleted]", "NTA.

I don't really get the shaming and many people say that Opie was seeking attention but like he literally went to a tree to look for shade but it didn't work and he went to go and get the parasol. \n\nHonestly the only thing that nipped me was that he lied by saying he was going to the bathroom and that I can say he was a bit wrong or totally wrong but everything else it was more like the Dad and brothers were basically making fun of him and if anyone should be embarrassed it should be op because like being safe is nothing to be seen as less manly. \n\nAll I can say is that Opie yeah a bit of the a-hole but I would say his girlfriend was more of the a-hole as well as her family for making jokes even if it was light-hearted I guess it might have given Opie's girlfriend the impression that the men are supposed to be more tougher and supposed to take on the sun directly and in turn can be sort of toxic because it is more foolish to stay under blistering hot sun and not protect yourself whether it be by sunblock or even finding shade that works entirely.

My advice would be to sit down and talk to her, explain how you felt during the BBQ and why you felt like you needed to act like you did, and ask her why she doens't like you wearing your parasol and how she expects you to act, after this you both can decide if you really want to stay together.", "Surely a hat is better than a parasol as it then leaves your hands free.", "You can use sunscreen, wear a hat, go inside...
