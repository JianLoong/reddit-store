Maybe your MIL\u2019s nickname should be doodoo lol", "They are utter fools. NTA.  I also recommend an intro course or a book about linguistics.  Learning IPA and the difference between pronunciations and enunciations is crucial here.  My own name has three different ns in it and it travels back from dental to velar.  Funny that my wife and I double barreled our last names and now we both don't pronounce it \"right\".  You MIL is taking out her inability to hear distinctions in spanish on you.

I have felt that both MIL and FIL are racist, but accepting of me because I\u2019m very culturally American.

By not removing a harmless sentimental nickname?", "YTA for saying she\u2019s not being inclusive, she\u2019s Mexican she gave her kid a Mexican nickname. My husband is Hispanic, his father calls him \u201cMijo and me \u201cMijita\u201d it\u2019s okay to use nicknames from your culture.", "Lol normally these nicknames are used solely within the family. I don\u2019t expect my child to go by tutu with her peers in the future. My parents still have endearing nicknames for me. They are and always will be the only ones who use those nicknames.", "FWIW, I'm of German and English descent, and my family has nicknames. In fact, my father always called his younger brother \"Sweet Pea\", and his brother called him \"Junie\". Two hefty, substantial, middle-aged, 6' men, calling each other Sweet Pea and Junie. When I was a baby, my father called me \"Creature\", because when they brought me home from the hospital, the dogs were fascinated by this strange new creature in their midst. Nicknames are not at all unusual \u2013 I can't think of even one family I know of that doesn't use any nicknames at all for anyone.\n\nYour MIL can go take a flying leap. You are NTA, but she's a big one.", "Maybe explain to your mil that you didn\u2019t stop her from using her own nickname for your kids. That you appreciate her to show you the same respect. Especially since these are your kids", "I come from a mixed race family and there were definitely times where the nickname my dad gave me was said in public spaces in front of peers. Despite my hatred for the nickname my dad gave me, honestly, this is kind of a sweet sentiment. I never thought of it that way also, I was never close to my dad's roots.  It explains why my dad (rip) was so attached to the nickname he gave me and wouldn't stop calling it despite my wishes and hating the darn thing."]}
