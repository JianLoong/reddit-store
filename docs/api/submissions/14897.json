Maybe your MIL\u2019s nickname should be doodoo lol", "They are utter fools. NTA.  I also recommend an intro course or a book about linguistics.  Learning IPA and the difference between pronunciations and enunciations is crucial here.  My own name has three different ns in it and it travels back from dental to velar.  Funny that my wife and I double barreled our last names and now we both don't pronounce it \"right\".  You MIL is taking out her inability to hear distinctions in spanish on you.  Shut that down and of course encourage your kid to pick up those differences.", "NTA", "NTA and if this persists give her a nickname of your own!", "INFO:  Do you and MIL usually get along?  Do you feel/believe that MIL has an issue with your ethnicity?  Do you feel MIL mocks nicknames due to an aversion to nicknames or is it you she is mocking?

If not I 'm going to go with ESH-.You're MIl for being racist and for you for not considering how this nickname might sound to future classmates. Do you think children will care about the technically of a Spanish  t sounding like a d? As someone who's been bullied,  most likely not.\n\nEdit: I don't think I explained this well, but whether the kids are being raised in a Spanish speaking country or English can have an influence on perception (also, I assumed where OP is from, my bad). My point is if the kids are being raised/spend most of their time in a Spanish speaking country the pronunciation is going to be perceived very much as normal. \n\nWhen in a bilingual situation when you're mostly around English speakers, who might not even speak Spanish, you tend to perceive things differently. There's no way of getting around that the nickname sounds like a derivative of poo. I'd hope most adults are more mature and would attribute this to differences in language (obviously, OPs MIL isn't), however kids tend to be cruel, this coming from someone who grew up in a mixed Mexican/White family.\n\nMIL is definitely old enough to be aware of language differences, and her comments were definitely inappropriate.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I have felt that both MIL and FIL are racist, but accepting of me because I\u2019m very culturally American. My MIL has given both my daughters her own nicknames and use them exclusively over their real names. I was angry, but had never stood up to her.

By not removing a harmless sentimental nickname?", "YTA for saying she\u2019s not being inclusive, she\u2019s Mexican she gave her kid a Mexican nickname. My husband is Hispanic, his father calls him \u201cMijo and me \u201cMijita\u201d it\u2019s okay to use nicknames from your culture.", "Lol normally these nicknames are used solely within the family. I don\u2019t expect my child to go by tutu with her peers in the future. My parents still have endearing nicknames for me. They are and always will be the only ones who use those nicknames.", "FWIW, I'm of German and English descent, and my family has nicknames. In fact, my father always called his younger brother \"Sweet Pea\", and his brother called him \"Junie\". Two hefty, substantial, middle-aged, 6' men, calling each other Sweet Pea and Junie. When I was a baby, my father called me \"Creature\", because when they brought me home from the hospital, the dogs were fascinated by this strange new creature in their midst. Nicknames are not at all unusual \u2013 I can't think of even one family I know of that doesn't use any nicknames at all for anyone.\n\nYour MIL can go take a flying leap. You are NTA, but she's a big one.", "Maybe explain to your mil that you didn\u2019t stop her from using her own nickname for your kids. That you appreciate her to show you the same respect. Especially since these are your kids", "I come from a mixed race family and there were definitely times where the nickname my dad gave me was said in public spaces in front of peers. Despite my hatred for the nickname my dad gave me, honestly, this is kind of a sweet sentiment. I never thought of it that way also, I was never close to my dad's roots.  It explains why my dad (rip) was so attached to the nickname he gave me and wouldn't stop calling it despite my wishes and hating the darn thing.", "Kind of an asshole. She was being disrespectful for sure about the nickname. To me it's in no which way shape or form a racist comment. She said nothing about your culture, nationality, color, or ethnicity. She may feel other children make fun of her for the sound of the nickname, and she doesn't want to see her granddaughter hurt. She has no business whatsoever telling you not to have a nickname for your child, she's your child. However I believe it's nowhere near a racist comment", "i\u2019m black and my boyfriends family is mexican. my nickname is flaca. once my fil said \u201cmama flaca\u201d while handing me my son and his accent made it sound like he said \u201cmother fucker\u201d. instead of making a big deal about it i just repeated \u201cmama flaca\u201d \n\nNTA. they\u2019re making a big deal over accents. it honestly does feel racist that she\u2019s mocking the language and culture.", "i learned from my inlaws that literally EVERYBODY gets a nickname in mexican culture. im flaca, my boyfriend is pansa, my bil is huevo, my mil is peca. nicknames are important to them", "My two grandsons have nicknames  that I gave them, and have used since thier birth.  24 yo is Gooby guy.  Most often called Goobs.  The 17 yo is Punkinhead. I even have called him that in front of his friends.  He doesn't get teased about it.  Nicknames are common and important in my family.", "Well good thing it\u2019s an endearing nickname for a baby, and she\u2019ll likely outgrow the nickname.", "NTA.  Your MIL needs to take a deep breath and learn to be respectful. \n\nNicknames are common in many family cultures and there\u2019s no need for her to act like she is in charge of how you guys do things.", "ESH...\n\nBased on the little amount of info you've provided, it seems like a big jump to go straight to calling her racist for this... maybe there are other incidents that add to your thoughts, but based on this one thing, your MIL is an AH but not necessarily racist...", "NTA but also wrong that's not what racism means lol", "I was thinking the same... MIL is a bit of an AH, but that's a hell of a jump to racist..."]}
