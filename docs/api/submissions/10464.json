I want to make it aware before I post the interaction that I bought my daughters first car, paid off half of it for her, and she has been living with me rent free all of her life (obviously expected, im her parent, and i made that decision not to make her pay anything). About a year ago my daughter lost her full time, well paying job due to not showing up to work most of the time. I haven't hassled her about it, but about 6 months it came up in conversation when she was talking about wanting to go to college. I told her that i would help her as much as I could financially but i'm not the wealthiest man. We live in a small two bedroom two bath apartment. My daughter understood, and told me she was going to start looking for jobs. She found a better paying job than her last, but decided a few months later she didn't want to go to college because the job she has currently could support her lifestyle and she didn't feel the need to spend the extra money on school. A few weeks ago I was stressing over bills, and sat down with her to ask her if she could\npotentially start contributing to some of the side bills or even groceries so that I wouldn't have to worry about rent as much. Mind you, I pay all of the bills including groceries and such, and even pay for her toiletries and sometimes clothes as well. She told me she didn't know if she could do that. I got a little frustrated and told her I needed her to help with bills or she was going to have to find another place to live so that I could move into a new place to be able to afford them myself with more leeway since i'm living basically paycheck to paycheck. She told me she would see, and I let it go and didn't push it any further thinkings she would work something out. Mind you, my daughter brings home almost 1300 a week. Yesterday I sat down with her to rediscuss and came up with a reasonable number for her to give me a month. I asked her for 800 a month. That's around 200 a week which is completely affordable for her. She got upset with me and told me that her money is HER money and if she has to pay me to live with me then she was going to move out. I tried to explain to her that i'm struggling with bills and love that she lives with me but it's getting hard to support her and me on top of it. She started yelling at me and crying, saying that she shouldn't have to pay bills because she's my daughter.

Because it only makes sense that working adults contribute to the financial needs of the household as well as with chores! \nIf she\u2019s not going to school, then she needs to move out and figure the rest of her life out. You do not owe her anything else! You sound like an awesome dad who has supported her not only financially but even through some of her less than ideal choices. \n\nThis time you are the one that needs some support and sadly she didn\u2019t deliver.

I'm sure it's hard, but you're doing her a favor now, and likely putting yourself in a better situation.

Maybe kicking her out seems a bit harsh but you didn't just immediately jump to this, it was a long time in the making.

You are not required to house your adult child who can afford somewhere themselves.", "NTA - she may be your daughter but she is also a grown ass adult who should a) be contributing to the household b) paying her way in life c) finding her own accommodation if she won't do a or b", "NTA 22 is old enough to start contributing to bills/rent especially when she has a relatively well paid job and you're struggling.

It's time for her to face the reality and realize what's it like living by herself and paying all the bills on her own.", "NTA. She's an adult. Unfortunately she's also been indulged for too long. Losing a job because she hardly ever turned up shows how little she respects money, you or her living situation. \n\nYou can no longer afford to keep her and at 22, you don't have to. The cool-off period at her mother's will do her good; either she'll realise she wants to live with you and will come back and pay you, or her mother will have to pay for her entire upkeep. Let's see how long THAT lasts. \n\nPersonally, and I speak from experience of being a bit of a spoiled brat myself at her age, you could do with asking her to find somewhere else because your relationship will be better for it. She doesn't respect you under your roof and I bet you'll still indulge her when she neglects to give you rent for whatever reason. She needs to experience the real world. She'll appreciate you more in the long run.", "NTA.\n\nYou're living paycheck to paycheck trying to support you both. You asked her for a reasonable contribution that's only around 15% of her income. Living on her own or with roommates who split the cost equally would likely cost her a lot more than that.\n\nSounds to me as if she simply doesn't know how expensive living on her own would be. Give her time, and maybe she'll come around. If not, downsize to a 1BR apartment and start building up some savings.", "NTA", "NTA.

Six months before my 18th birthday, my parents told me I could live rent free until I August 2nd.  My birthday is in mid-March.  I graduated June 2nd.  I had two months to 1) go to college, 2) join the military, or 3) find a full-time job.  If I was in school full-time, I would be allowed to live rent free but would have to do chores (sweat equity) on the weekend.  If I joined the military, I was welcome to stay with them as a guest when I came home on leave.  If I was working full-time, they would charge me rent that would still leave me enough to save money for my own place.\n\nI started college on June 12th.  I moved in with my grandparents because their home was closer to my university than my parents' home.  I did chores for my grandparents and periodically brought in a pizza or Subway sandwiches to share with my grandmother (my grandfather was strictly a meat and potatoes kind of guy and she wouldn't get anything special for herself, so I did).  I also did chores when I was out at my parents' house on weekends or between semesters.\n\nI'm not sure where you live, but if you're here in the U.S., I'm not sure about your daughter's salary.  I earn $5250/a mo. with two BAs (Criminal Justice and English), half an MFA, and 17 insurance adjuster's licenses.  Your daughter is 22, no college degree and less than stellar work history.  I'm curious as to what kind of job she has.\n\nRegardless of what she's earning, at 22 years of age, she needs to be contributing if she's not in school full-time.  Your obligation to support her ended either 1) when she turned 18 or 2) when she dropped out of school (depending on the terms of your divorce decree).  Let her mooch off her mom for a while.  Eventually, her mother will also get tired of being a meal ticket and will give her the same option you did.\n\nSometimes, you have to push the fledgling out of the nest if you want to be able to afford an empty nest.", "Wow. $800 for room and board a month is so much less than she will be paying to live on her own.

She's making more money than some folks make in their lifetimes, and she's upset at paying part of the rent?

She didn't go that route (which is fine, she's doing better than I am at 23 with a degree) but that safety net can't last forever. Does she expect to be living with you rent free when you're 80? Probably not. That change has to begin some time, and now is a good time to begin it. She's still able to put away money and have personal money left over for her own use. She's biting the hand that feeds her big-time and probably doesn't even realize it. It might be good to lay out both options; where money goes if she pays 800 in rent with you, or where it goes if she pays full rent, utilities, groceries, etc in your area for an apartment alone.", "NTA. \n\nI think that if I were to approach this in the future, I'd do it differently. \n\nInstead of asking her for money, I would simply make YOUR plan. \n\n\"Daughter, here is my situation.

She\u2019s 22 and makes $67k/year. Why isn\u2019t she living on her own already?  \n\n\u201cHer\u201d money could then support her. \n\nI feel sorry for any future roommate she has.", "NTA. If I ever had to move back home, I would much rather pay my parents rent then to be expected to do the chores. Not to say I wouldn\u2019t do chores, but when I was living there while in college, the chores were my rent, and I\u2019d rather pay money than go back to that. Your daughter was contributing nothing??? To the house at all??? And expected you to just deal with it???", "NTA.\nShe\u2019s an adult with a full time job who isn\u2019t in school. She should be paying something.", "NTA: wait\u2026 she make how much a week? $1300??? Yet she can\u2019t pay $800 a MONTH to help give her a place to live? I say take care of you!! You have clearly done enough to help her and she is an adult. Find a nice studio or one bedroom apt and be done.  Let her mom enable her entitled behavior. She is no longer your problem.", "NTA. Time for your daughter to move out if she's not willing to pay rent etc.  She is an adult working full time.", "NTA", "NTA", "Money when you don\u2019t need it you actually do need it.", "Ikr?! Also I'm wondering wtf job she has that she's taking home 5200 a month. I make 70k/yr and my take-home pay is like 4k/mo! This girl is making like ~85-90k with nothing beyond a GED and is complaining about being asked to pay 800/mo in rent to her dad who has supported her to get to this point?! My blood boils for OP", "Well said! \nI think he created the problem himself. But that doesnt mean he can\u2019t correct it. Its time to let the daughter try some responsbility.", "Lots of times you'll see stuff from the other angle where parents hit a teen entering college with near market rent for an apartment, just to keep their room and have to do chores and their own groceries to boot.", "Months (except February) have 4 and 1/2 weeks so if she earns 260sh/day that is close to 6k a month depending if the month is 22 or 23 working days.", "At least you\u2019ll never see your daughter again. That must make you happy", "no, it doesn't.  but i've expressed that i'm struggling and she makes enough to be able to contribute. what else am i supposed to do when i can barely afford the rent on my own", "That\u2019s completely uncalled for. She\u2019s an adult with a paying job and no plans on going to school, she\u2019s even said she can maintain her lifestyle with the job she has so she isn\u2019t in some dire straits or anything. She\u2019s mooching off her dad and he\u2019s not able to make ends meet anymore. What else is he supposed to do?"]}
