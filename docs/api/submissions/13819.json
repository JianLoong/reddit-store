Now, my coworker (F28) just went through a nasty breakup and because she was living in her boyfriends house, had to move out when they broke up.\n\nWe were getting lunch at work and i could tell she was upset, so i asked what was wrong and she explained what had happened and was extremely upset that she didn\u2019t know where she was going to go as her parents live over 2 hours away, so i offered her and her (3F) child a place to stay, just until she got back in her feet and found somewhere to live.\n\nShe was extremely grateful and everything was  great to start with, i didn\u2019t make her pay rent as i own my flat (my parents bought it for me as a 20th birthday present) and i know, with the cost of living crisis that times are hard. We made an agreement that we would go 60-40 on food and utilities as there\u2019s 2 of them, and only one of me and she was completely happy with this agreement.\n\nNow, it\u2019s been 7 months since she\u2019s moved in and things have got a bit rocky.

I have nothing against her child, i love her and she\u2019s a good kid but i\u2019m being treated as an unpaid babysitter on the weekends and some weeknights.\n\nI put my foot down 3 weeks ago and said that if she doesn\u2019t pay me at least half of the 3 months bills that she owes me by thursday that her and her child would have to leave my house and find somewhere else. Well, there was no payment so when i got home from work  i took all their stuff, boxed it up and when she got home from picking her child up, told her to get out. However, i went into work today and my other coworker said that she\u2019s been going around telling people i\u2019m maliciously making her and her child homeless because we had a \u201cpetty argument\u201d so now i\u2019ve got the whole office on my ass.\n\nI really don\u2019t care about the bills she owes anymore but i don\u2019t appreciate the fact that she\u2019s going around trashing me.

I\u2019m so sorry. \n\nYou tried to help her out and she got too comfortable. \n\nThis is why I will never invite someone to live with me, I\u2019ll get you some resources and help you apply, I\u2019ll even pay for a motel room for a week or so but no inviting you into my house. Now all lines are blurred and everyone is in your business \n\nExplain yo your coworkers that you allowed her to move in, the arrangement and that she wasn\u2019t paying rent. She was using you as a free babysitter and haven\u2019t been paying the shared bills. She was taking advantage. If anyone have a problem ask them to open their home to her since they are so damn kind and have opinions. See how many volunteer\n\n I have a client like her who just sucks up all peoples kindness and resources, never willing to do anything to help herself but then pikachu face when people are just done with her. It makes it so damn hard to care and keep trying to get her life and her children\u2019s lives back on track.", "Nta and probably the smartest thing you did. And if you take her back, imagine how bad it will be the next time.

Then to have the audacity to spread lies.", "NTA. She was taking advantage of you. Unfortunately with people like her she would trash talk you regardless.

I am pretty sure you cannot just kick someone out.\n\nShe started to OP for granted. They were being so generous. Poor kid.", "She said the baby daddy has gone MIA??? Not sure what that means maybe he's not the real dad, I mean how much does OP really know about the coworker", "In the United States, nowhere that I'm aware of.\n\nLike it or not, the woman was a tenant with tenant rights.

In my experience, trying to stick up for yourself against someone that appears more vulnerable than you always makes you look like the bad guy. Even if, like in this case, you definitely aren't the bad guy, they aren't as vulnerable as they make themselves out to be, and the gossip is completely untrue. The gossip will subside quicker, and her true colours will show through faster too.", "Tell your coworkers what you shared on here with everyone!! Don\u2019t sugar coat anything, plus?

She's refusing to pay rent and food and using you as a free babysitter so she can go party every weekend. \n\nTell them!! Than go to HR.", "NTA, how is she going out with friends when saving money to move out? The answer is she isn't, she settled in and was just milking it.  She probably does not earn enough to raise the child, live independent and work full time on her own,  many don't. That leaves you supporting her forever unless she is forced to figure it out. \n\nI would keep it simple at work - speak to her directly and advise you will go to HR if she persists. Tell anyone who asks if they want to house and feed her, and be her nanny, with no compensation to step right up.", "YTA, you kicked her out unexpectedly, sounds like an illegal eviction where I\u2019m at. The problem only started out of kindness, caring for Her welfare so much you let Her bring Her problems into Your home. You only did it to be nice and do some good. However that coworker is in a state in life that she needs a support system and she doesn\u2019t have the time to slow down and think about her own decisions. A young woman like yourself with a full time job is not prepared to help others manage their life. If you had any college dorm experience you\u2019d know that fallouts between people in close spaces like this is common, us humans are not built for that lifestyle. \n\nIf you hadn\u2019t kicked her out I would\u2019ve suggested giving her deadlines to help her focus on the goal of moving out, and preferably getting into good graces with Her parents.

She's scared you're gonna tell people the truth so she's getting her lie out there first. There's no way she isn't embarrassed now. She took advantage of you and the situation.
