Now, my coworker (F28) just went through a nasty breakup and because she was living in her boyfriends house, had to move out when they broke up.\n\nWe were getting lunch at work and i could tell she was upset, so i asked what was wrong and she explained what had happened and was extremely upset that she didn\u2019t know where she was going to go as her parents live over 2 hours away, so i offered her and her (3F) child a place to stay, just until she got back in her feet and found somewhere to live.\n\nShe was extremely grateful and everything was  great to start with, i didn\u2019t make her pay rent as i own my flat (my parents bought it for me as a 20th birthday present) and i know, with the cost of living crisis that times are hard. We made an agreement that we would go 60-40 on food and utilities as there\u2019s 2 of them, and only one of me and she was completely happy with this agreement.\n\nNow, it\u2019s been 7 months since she\u2019s moved in and things have got a bit rocky. She\u2019s been behind on bills for 3 months, and keeps saying that she\u2019s struggling as she\u2019s been taking less hours at work as she is finding it difficult to find childcare that doesn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg as her ex has pretty much been MIA and it works out cheaper for her to work less and put her child in nursery 3 days a week instead of 5.\nAnd whilst i can afford to pay for all of the bills as i have a higher position at work and more hours i don\u2019t want to be taken advantage of, i don\u2019t mind helping her out or spotting her some money (which i have done in the past) i feel as though she has no incentive to pay bills anytime soon either.\n\nIt gets worse, she\u2019s now taken to wanting to get out of the house and meet up with some of her friends regularly (2/3 times a week) and expects me to watch her child. I have nothing against her child, i love her and she\u2019s a good kid but i\u2019m being treated as an unpaid babysitter on the weekends and some weeknights.\n\nI put my foot down 3 weeks ago and said that if she doesn\u2019t pay me at least half of the 3 months bills that she owes me by thursday that her and her child would have to leave my house and find somewhere else. Well, there was no payment so when i got home from work  i took all their stuff, boxed it up and when she got home from picking her child up, told her to get out. However, i went into work today and my other coworker said that she\u2019s been going around telling people i\u2019m maliciously making her and her child homeless because we had a \u201cpetty argument\u201d so now i\u2019ve got the whole office on my ass.\n\nI really don\u2019t care about the bills she owes anymore but i don\u2019t appreciate the fact that she\u2019s going around trashing me.

I would go to HR and explain that this woman is creating a hostile work environment for you and you want it to stop.", "NTA, she was using you for everything she could. She should have been able to save since you let her stay for basically free. She took this as a time to cut back her hours, go out partying more, since she had someone to cover all the bills and watch the kid. Free ride!! She\u2019s a habitual mooch, probably why the boyfriend got tired of her crap as well.", "NTA. This goes into the \u201cno good deed goes unpunished\u201d category. \n\nIt sucks for her that you want her out, but she\u2019s not your responsibility. Her child is not your responsibility. She has parents she can go to. She clearly has other friends since she goes out with them. \n\nNot sure of the laws where you\u2019re at. In some places you\u2019d have to legally evict her. In any case the result would be the same. \n\nStay out of the gossip at work. It sounds like you have. If she disrupts your ability to work, make it a management issue.", "I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re the asshole but when she moved in you shouldn\u2019t have left it open ended by letting her stay \u201cuntil she got back in her feet\u201d.  You should have set a time limit of however long.  Then she would have nothing to bitch about.  She was definitely taking advantage of you, though.  I\u2019m guessing she went from living for free with her parents to living for free with her boyfriend and has never learned to take care of herself.", "NTA \n\nShe\u2019s pushing her boundaries with you by overstaying her welcome. But you also didn\u2019t set them very well to be honest. You went from 0 to 100 with her. \n\nYou sound like a person who wanted to do a nice thing for someone and in the end it backfired a bit. The fact that work is involved definitely makes it tougher. However, you don\u2019t really owe her anything- you did more than enough anyway helping her out for that long anyway.", "NTA\n\nThis was always meant to be a temporary arrangement, yet now your co-worker is treating you like a pseudo-partner.\n\nShe was never going to pay you.\n\nWhile I\u2019m not sure about the legality of how you handled what amounts to an eviction (and there are often different rules for lodgers vs. tenants) ethically you gave her three weeks warning.\n\nYou shouldn\u2019t have to continue being financial support for a lodger who doesn\u2019t pay, regardless of their circumstances. And you were only charging food and utilities, not rent!\n\nShe\u2019s had seven months.\n\nShe was taking advantage of you. \n\nAnd now she\u2019s trying to smear your name by calling you malicious over a petty argument. She\u2019s trying to make you responsible for her and her child - you are not. \n\nNon-payment and being treated like an unpaid live in babysitter isn\u2019t petty.", "NTA no, of course you weren't unreasonable. She's still the same person who was impossible to live with. On the up side, she has given you a simple litmus test for determining which of your coworkers are jerks.", "NTA.

Yes, she 100% deserves to be gone, but the time limit you gave is not legal in most places. She has been there for 60+ days. \n\nYou went from no consequences to all the consequences like whip lash.\n\nAs soon as you wrote, \"on her feet\" it was evident where this was going.", "When you let someone move in for months with an agreement to pay you, they become your tenant. Depending on where you live, you might be actually breaking the law by boxing her stuff up and telling her to get out.   \n\n\nI get that you told her, \u201cPay me by Thursday or you have to leave,\u201d but that\u2019s not exactly the same as saying, \u201cYou have to leave on Thursday.\u201d She took advantage of you, but after 7 months, she had the reasonable expectation of getting notice on actually vacating the premises. ESH.", "NTA. You did the right thing and took her and her child in and she took advantage of your kindness. It\u2019s one thing to not pay the bills but it\u2019s another to go hanging out with friends and expect you watch her child. Neither of which is okay to do. \n\nIf the money is of no concern to you I would recommend cutting all ties and going to HR to explain your situation. Be sure to make it known you don\u2019t want her reprimanded or fired just talked to about speaking on private issues in the workplace. You don\u2019t want this to turn into some BS retaliation situation (I rhymed).

She had 7 months of living rent free, minimal bills/groceries and free childcare, and is now actively making your work life awful. Sorry OP.", "NTA  but this prove the old saying ... no good deed goes unpunished.", "NTA. You housed her, rent free, for seven months. She isn't even paying the utilities as promised. She's leaving her kid with you to babysit even though you didn't agree to that. You have a flat so you should be in an area with some childcare assistance. \n\nThe entire office can house her. She can't get any help for her kid? I find this all extremely unlikely.", "No you were unreasonable to yourself for taking her in the first place. NTA. Lesson learnt I hope.", "Id just tell them \"She had a free place to stay at for 7 months to save money. She did not and now wants a free nanny too, when should she she move into your place, what's your address so I could pass it on to her?\"", "Agree on ESH. OP went from not enforcing any consequences to 'get me half within a week or you're out.' That's unreasonable. \n\nObviously her retaliation at work is highly unreasonable too.", "I'm not really one to spread information but I would definitely let people know not to take this moocher in..."]}
