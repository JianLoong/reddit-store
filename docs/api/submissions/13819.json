Now, my coworker (F28) just went through a nasty breakup and because she was living in her boyfriends house, had to move out when they broke up.\n\nWe were getting lunch at work and i could tell she was upset, so i asked what was wrong and she explained what had happened and was extremely upset that she didn\u2019t know where she was going to go as her parents live over 2 hours away, so i offered her and her (3F) child a place to stay, just until she got back in her feet and found somewhere to live.\n\nShe was extremely grateful and everything was  great to start with, i didn\u2019t make her pay rent as i own my flat (my parents bought it for me as a 20th birthday present) and i know, with the cost of living crisis that times are hard. We made an agreement that we would go 60-40 on food and utilities as there\u2019s 2 of them, and only one of me and she was completely happy with this agreement.\n\nNow, it\u2019s been 7 months since she\u2019s moved in and things have got a bit rocky. She\u2019s been behind on bills for 3 months, and keeps saying that she\u2019s struggling as she\u2019s been taking less hours at work as she is finding it difficult to find childcare that doesn\u2019t cost an arm and a leg as her ex has pretty much been MIA and it works out cheaper for her to work less and put her child in nursery 3 days a week instead of 5.\nAnd whilst i can afford to pay for all of the bills as i have a higher position at work and more hours i don\u2019t want to be taken advantage of, i don\u2019t mind helping her out or spotting her some money (which i have done in the past) i feel as though she has no incentive to pay bills anytime soon either.\n\nIt gets worse, she\u2019s now taken to wanting to get out of the house and meet up with some of her friends regularly (2/3 times a week) and expects me to watch her child. I have nothing against her child, i love her and she\u2019s a good kid but i\u2019m being treated as an unpaid babysitter on the weekends and some weeknights.\n\nI put my foot down 3 weeks ago and said that if she doesn\u2019t pay me at least half of the 3 months bills that she owes me by thursday that her and her child would have to leave my house and find somewhere else. Well, there was no payment so when i got home from work  i took all their stuff, boxed it up and when she got home from picking her child up, told her to get out. However, i went into work today and my other coworker said that she\u2019s been going around telling people i\u2019m maliciously making her and her child homeless because we had a \u201cpetty argument\u201d so now i\u2019ve got the whole office on my ass.\n\nI really don\u2019t care about the bills she owes anymore but i don\u2019t appreciate the fact that she\u2019s going around trashing me.
