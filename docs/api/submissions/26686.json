You gave him and his parents chances to correct his behavior. His parents didn't take your complaints serious and neither did he.

He is an adult he\u2019s old enough to be in college and therefore old enough to know how to not be an awful person who menaces innocent animals. Stay firm on this, you\u2019re doing the right thing.", "NTA. He was warned and he didn't care. He lost a scholarship but hey at least he learnt actions have consequences.", "NTA but what else is he coming to you with? I see a lot of other comments that he\u2019s learned his lesson, drop the charges, and I might agree if you didn\u2019t warn him and the parents multiple times and if he apologized more than once or came with some offering.

If there's a question about whether his behavior is inappropriate, he can just explain to the scholarship committee that \"kids will be kids\" and that makes trespassing, theft, and terrorizing innocent animals ok and work out the issues with the scholarship with them, and leave you out of it.\n\nHe is young and did not receive appropriate parenting. Perhaps he can learn. Why not suggest he try applying for the scholarship next year and in the meantime he can get a job to help pay his costs if he necessary?

I know you probably also want to be a good guy about this.\n\nReally though, if he's in college and acting this stupid, then he needs to learn a lesson.\n\nYou're not ruining his future.

If the knew it wouldn't fly, they had ample opportunity to attempt to talk some sense into their kid.\n\nAnd if their kid was going to do this no matter what, that does speak to something in his character that is off, certainly not what you would expect of a good citizen. Instead of bugging you to pretend nothing happened, this kid should be getting some counseling for why he kept feeling compelled to trespass and why he wanted to escalate the harm he intended to cause.\n\nAnd last of all, suppose you dropped those charges. That doesn't necessarily mean the kid would have the scholarship reinstated. The committee knows that he did this. If I were on the committee, I would still be uninclined to reinstate the scholarship. Sometimes people just have to live with the consequences of their choices.\n\nI would set up some cameras though.

Now when there are consequences for his behaviour he whines. Apparently he needs this lesson.\n\nNTA", "NTA   \nHe needs therapy, not a scholarship. He is obviously disturbed. Don't drop it.", "NTA.  Don't drop the charges and tell him and his parents that just like 'kids will be kids', 'actions have consequences'.  Tell the kid you are sorry that his parents didn't ever teach him that.\n\nHe can try again next year if he behaves.", "NTA\n\nHe should of thought of that before he broke the law", "They made themselves lose the scholarship.\n\nNTA", "NTA - He's losing the scholarship, to bad, so sad. That's the only reason the little shit and his parents are apologizing. Do not drop the charges. You had to involve the police due to many issues in the past of his trespassing and harassment and the lack of getting involved to stop this by his parents. They enabled and turned a blind eye. Now it's time for all three to be unblinded to the results of their actions and inactions.\n\nDrop the charges, and the BS will start again, guaranteed.", "He SHOT CHICKENS and his parents are mad at YOU for putting his future in jeopardy for something minor? What the ever loving nta fuck?", "He deserves nothing, but maybe you could drop the charges and give him a chance to prove himself by working for you for a few weeks, no salary of course. But like get him to get his hands dirty and take care of farm work or something. Maybe that will teach him a lesson and also let him keep his scholarship.", "NTA.\n\nTormenting animals for fun is classical sociopathic behaviour. If he is one, he isn't even capable of remorse", "NTA\ncarry on with thr charges or it'll teach him a false apology is enough to get out of most shit.", "NTA..but I do worry if you keep going he will stay at home and then really target your animals. As an option, drop charges if the parents pay for cameras you'll put up and also draft a good behaviour bond..if he comes back to the property and you capture it on film they pay $5k or whatever the limit on civil court in your area.\n\nI am not sure how enforceable it is..so you may want to get legal advice. But at least that way the turd hopefully goes away to school and the parents will watch him like a hawk because the penalty is on their shoulders?", "100% NTA\n\nIf he's willing to shoot bbs at chickens, there is a high likelihood he'll be willing to shoot bullets at classmates.  Never look aside at animal abuse/cruelty. Because that shit escalates.", "Only a psycho does such to innocent beings. Getting his scholarship revokes is too mild. \nNTA", "The dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubed.\nYou tried the less escalative way to no avail already.\n\nHe needed to be humbled.\n\nNTA", "NTA. He ruined his chances and his life by repeatedly harassing you and trying to kill your animals. I'd have had trouble not laughing at them when they said scholarship was for or included needing to be a good citizen. What were you meant to do when he started acting with increasing hostility to you? Wait until this good citizen set a barn on fire or peppered you with pellets. Abusing you was his hobby. Consequences to that but get trail cams on your barn.", "Let the scholarship go to another kid that actually deserves it. NTA", "NTA. He deserves it.", "This is exactly why he felt entitled to break the law again and again and never gave you any respect, because his parents tell him everything he does is just fine. He had to learn about the real world and it's consequences sooner or later, and sooner is always best.", "NTA. Stand firm.  This guy doesn't deserve a scholarship based on good citizenship.  He's not a good citizen- he's a person who lets goat lose, terrorizes chickens, drinks, smokes, and is a huge nuisance. \nI also find it difficult to believe you are the only one to experience acts of poor citizenship from this guy. Who put the fix in, or who is he connected to for him to get this scholarship in the first place? Let the scholarship go to the runner-up. You stand firm.", "NTA let someone better have the scholarship. Many people think it\u2019s okay to be a AH if the kids are doing well in school.", "If you're in a rural area this is a very important lesson for him to learn because most farmers aren't going to go to the cops when someone tries to kill their animals, they're just going to shoot him.", "It wasn't your dog, cat or other companion animal but its still a nasty thing for sure.  Teens frontal lobes aren't always developed fully and they can do some pretty terrible things which they will regret later in life.  You don't have much to lose if you just let it go.  Sounds like his parents didn't raise him right if he kept on trespassing after they was notified.  Maybe he will go to college and learn something about morality, I sure did with some of the classes about history, race, and ethics.  If you can let it go this young man may take it as a lesson and do well.  I would understand and respect your decision either way.", "NTA. His parents should have thought about that the first time you spoke to him.", "NTA. The time for the parents to intervene was when you went to them. They chose not to, they can't intervene now.", "NTA. I thought you meant it was an 8 year old, not a college age person! Not that it would matter. If they\u2019re sneaking around with a BB gun shooting on your land he needs to be watched by the authorities, even more so that they\u2019re not a child anymore!", "NTA but you\u2019re risking him not affording going to school, staying at home, having a chip on his shoulder and a bunch of spare time", "I'm an asshole and here is my opinion.  Fuck that kid. This has been going on for a year?  He has been fucking around for a year and finally found out?  No sympathy.  Kids will be kids is an excuse of lazy ass parents. They are only apologizing because of the consequences. They didn't give a shit about you until it affected them.", "You didn't make him lose anything, the consequences of his actions did. Fuck that kid, he's probably a sociopath anyway.", "NTA. he FAFO'd and now has to deal with the consequences. get cameras, if you haven't already.", "So this kid has harassed animals more then once, even trying to hurt them.\nGoes on private property, and even the parents don\u2019t stop him?\nIf you drop now he will never learn.\nTell them and your gf actions have consequences and you have warned more then once.\nThis kid and his family deserve whatever they get! And in this case it means losing scholarship.\nYeah.. stand your ground. NTA\nAnd if my kid would have done that he would have enormous consequences.!

If he is able to do both I see no problem with you dropping the charges", "NTA don\u2019t drop the charges. He only apologised because he was forced to. You didn\u2019t cause him to lose his scholarship, his own actions did.", "NTA. Screw that kid. You most likely did the college a favor keeping an animal abuser away from their campus.", "NTA  tell the parents \"If it was just trespassing I would drop it. But it wasn't. It was an attack on an animal. It was animal cruelty. And you as parents should be more horrified that he thought that was fun. Than annoyed at me for  teaching him that it's not!\"", "Consequences will be consequences, that\u2019s what I\u2019d tell his parents. Your choice, but I\u2019d leave the charges filed. It wasn\u2019t an accident, it didn\u2019t happen to him, he\u2019s not a victim. He\u2019s just a kid who did stupid s**t and now there are consequences.  He\u2019ll live and hopefully learn.", "NTA. He had ample opportunity to change his behavior and he didn\u2019t. He doesn\u2019t deserve the scholarship. If he doesn\u2019t get the scholarship, the next runner up will get to have scholarship money instead, or it\u2019ll let the scholarship committee give money to one extra kid next year.", "NTA, this sums it up perfectly", "This. NTA", "This right here!! The parents refused to listen, saw real consequences, and are now shifting blame unto you because they didn't do their job. This was animal abuse and criminal trespassing, the dude did not earn a scholarship in good citizenship!!", "100%. Anyone who can be that cruel to animals deserves to learn a lesson at the very least. That is unacceptable.", "This is a case of FAFO. I mean OP escalated it properly. Talked to the kid, went to the parents, and then law enforcement. There were chances given. \n\nNTA - this is a lesson for all of them", "So he broke an important clause in his scholarship agreement\u2026 bet there\u2019s a kid out there who just missed out on that scholarship who as behaved and would deserve it.\n\nNTA\u2026 but if you decide to drop the charges, I\u2019d make it conditional on him doing set volunteer work/sweat .. ie mucking out pig stys, helping elderly etc", "His scholarship is not fit good citizenship. It\u2019s just a clause that you have ti be a hood citizen etc. to keep the scholarship like probably keeping a certain GPA and so on.", "NTA\n\nCan you even \"drop charges\" for animal cruelty in your jurisdiction? It feels like this is something not to be decided by the owner (who could also be charged for this)?", "In a way OP might of done a good thing.\n\nNow the next kid in-line can get the scholarship instead.\n\nI mean...Hopefully the kid thats next in-line is more deserving than an animal abuser.", "This is the comment I was looking for, why can\u00b4t HE come to you on his own and offer some sort of plan for resolution, show some true remorse? \n\nHis parents forced him to come and apologize one time, they are sorry he got caught, not sorry that he did it. They didn\u00b4t care until the scholarship was in jeopardy. \n\nIf he was really sorry and learned his lesson then he should come to you and offer to work together to make it right the best he can.", "Yeah, the parents are the real AH here.", "This is actually good for the kid, to be honest. Young people going to college have an easier time and are better people to be around when they understand their actions have consequences. You can really tell the difference when you have to live with them!", "Right?! All I could think is this little freak is a sociopath in training.", "I dont understand how anyone can do that. I accidentally killed a pet chicken when I was 4-6, and I STILL feel bad about it 20 years later.", "Definitely, he may decide to retaliate, or even get friends to do it for him.", "Yeah, that is some serial killer shit.", "Agreed. He\u2019s NTA. As a show of \u201cbeing the bigger person\u201d I might drop the charges but be VERY clear that he absolutely may not be around the property again or the next time the charges definitely won\u2019t be dropped. But that\u2019s up to OP & I wouldn\u2019t fault him for not doing that at all", "That's a really good point!! It's not on OP", "I read it as he will lose the scholarship when the charges are finalized and he has his day in court", "It's amazing how many people know everything about this kids psychology from one one sided report about his behavior, that you have 0 ways to verify the veracity of. I'm astonished by this capacity. It's incredible.", "Even kids 10 or 12 know better. If my 10 year old did that he would never see his iPad again.", "I will argue that anyone that says, \"kids will be kids\" is not just letting, but encouraging such behavior.", "I had been thinking it is unusual for kids really interested in school to go around bothering innocent animals. Your suggestion that there is no scholarship and parents are lying make perfect sense. After all, they are that kind of parents, aren't they,?", "I was thinking the same type of thing. If OP really feels like his partner is right, or wants to pacify his neighborly relationship, there could be conditions. Something like probation. A sort of, we'll put it at 2 strikes and if you trespass again, if you touch or make use of devices or actions to interfere with this property in any way, etc. it's 3 strikes and I'm including the previous offenses. I don't know if that can legally happen - I suppose they'd need a contract or something?\n\nI don't know if that would work, or if the neighborly relationship is worth (or capable of) preserving, or any other factors. But it's an option if OP wants to consider those. I'd put up cameras though. The kid was out of line before he had any reason to feel \"disrespected\" - I'd be worried about escalations.", "He thinks it\u2019s fun to shoot small animals with BB guns. He\u2019s seriously lacking empathy and OP shouldn\u2019t let him anywhere near their animals.", "On the other hand, kid would have known about the behaviour clause in the scholarship (as would his parents) and they still thought that terrorising innocent animals is just \"kids being kids\".", "He needs a little jail time to focus his mind. 30 days should be sufficient. I say this as a criminal defense attorney.", "I sounds like OP didn\u2019t call the cops until the BB gun incident, so how would the scholarship committee possibly know about it to be able to disqualify him before this point?", "You be surprised how easy some of those are to get.  Like I got a \"citizen scholarship\" 3 or so years ago when I went back to school, for 3000 a year.  All I needed was a pastors recommendation, a teacher recommendation, and an essay on what being a good citizen meant to me in less than 5 pages.", "Good point. Mom and dad could be lying about the scholarship for sympathy.", "Not sure why down votes. But a kid like that and scholarship are not known to meet in this life time", "Lol he ain\u2019t getting that scholarship back even if OP wanted to drop the charges, which they shouldn\u2019t.", "Let the guy who actively hurt animals near the animals?????", "I love this response but I\u2019m also conflicted because.. also who shoots animals with BB guns for fun???? That\u2019s concerning", "Were you abusing animals?", "If he keeps the scholarship, all he will learn is that he can get away with criminal behavior and dodge the consequences. Next time, it will be something more serious. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nKid can still go to college if he really wants to. He will just have to take loans and work to earn his tuition. I agree that life is hard enough, but most of us still manage to not engage in criminal behavior this severe as teens. And its not even like this kid has abusive parents.
