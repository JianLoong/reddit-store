I told her that I parked within the lines and that she can enter her car through the passenger side door. She again asked me to move my car and I said no, turned around and enter the grocery store. I then glanced outside to see her struggling to get inside her car and driving off (I wanted to make sure she doesn't key my car or anything). I just want to mention that this woman seemed like she realized she screwed herself and wasn't mean or pushy through out the whole ordeal.\n\nAs I got home, I enthusiastically told my wife about my pettiness but she said I was an asshole for doing that and that I unnecessarily ruined this woman's day.

While it's not great, it's understandable that somebody wouldn't risk scratching their vehicle or another to stay fully within the lines if somebody is already pushing over the line or whatever.\n\nGiven that, I would say that yeah, it's probably easier to just back out and be polite to the lady and have a positive interaction than to leave yourself feeling like she's some asshole who parked badly and her feeling like you're some jackass who blocked her in after she already had to squeeze into her spot because some giant truck with extended mirrors was blocking her in, or whatever the case may have been.", "No judgement because it\u2019s always possible that someone BEFORE her had parked over the line making her have to park that way.

So I pulled into the only available pump and my vehicle is just under a foot away from their driver door. Right after I start pumping gas a lady comes out to the car and sees her driver door blocked.

No. But you knew it was a dick move considering your \u201cgleeful\u201d report back to your wife. Sure, the lady was an AH but she seemed to realize it and handled her crap.

Five minutes of courtesy would have handled it. You are not required to be courteous, but you should accept it makes you an AH.", "YTA, who appointed you the parking manager? Perhaps she had been forced to park like that by a badly parked truck on the other side. Perhaps she's just a poor parker. Either way, be the bigger person and show some manners.", "YTA. First of all, you are not the parking police. Let someone else deal with shit like this.

Then YTA.. but only slightly", "YTA, she was slightly over the line. She probably didn't do it on purpose, and she asked you nicely to move before you even entered the store. You even acknowledge that the spaces are small. So your parking extra close to the line means that you've pretty much done the same thing you're upset with her for doing.

The only people who'll have much sympathy for the woman who can't play (park) within the lines are other people who can't. I'd've refused to move my car, too.", "You're both assholes. She maybe could have parked better. It made you feel big or important to 'teach her a lesson' by being horrible to her and making her 'struggle'.

It wouldn't be hard for most people to get in through the other door but for all you know she could have a back issue or something that made that inconvenient or even painful.

Does it happen often around there?", "YTA. Being petty is just so ugly. You are clueless to why she had to park that way in the first place. Also...

It\u2019s not my problem the other driver bought a car they\u2019re not competent enough to park between the lines.", "NTA, next time let the air out of 2 of her tires. Still won't he the AH", "NTA\n\nShe parked like an asshole, got the consequences of said action, and took it like a champ.  I'm actually impressed by her.", "NTA- she learnt a lesson. Being an ass has consequences. Sounds like she's pretty entitled so hopefully this will make her think.", "NTA.  Parking within the lines is not hard.", "NTA. But, some would have accommodated her.", "I don't know if this lady made a mistake or was simply being an asshole because either way has a high possibility of being true, what I do know is that she asked you nicely, didn't get upset when you were clearly being rude for no reason and then left. You should ask yourself why you feel the need to Exact justice on strangers when you are unaware of their motives. people like you were the reason I quit my customer service jobs I just don't understand why so many people are just randomly angry at the world and why they choose to make it everyone else's problem. YTA", "NTA -  but next time maybe consider what kind of a day she was having ? I know some days where I'm mentally exhausted I have hiccups like that. Just something to keep in mind for next time ! We should all support eachother in this world - and kindness is priceless.", "NTA but I am going to ask are the parking spots meant for compact cars and this person's car was not a small one. Where I live that is quite common they redid all the parking lots for smaller cars and it has always caused problems. It is BS", "YTA for a few of reasons:\n\nFirstly, you don't know what the situation was when she arrived; you said yourself that the lot was full except for that one spot, maybe she was over the line to compensate for some other jackass parked several spots down.\n\nSecondly:\n\n>I have a small car and realized I could still park there provided I get very close to the parked car, blocking their driver side door, allowing me to comfortably exit through my driver side door.\n\nIf you reversed into the space instead you could have parked with your driver's side door opposite hers (and close to the vehicle on the other side), allowing you both to enter or exit your respective vehicles 'comfortably'. Instead you decided to play vigilante and made her life more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nThirdly:\n\n>She again asked me to move my car and I said no, turned around and enter the grocery store.... I just want to mention that this woman seemed like she realized she screwed herself and wasn't mean or pushy through out the whole ordeal.\n\nSo before you'd even left to go into the grocery store she calmly and reasonably asked you to move your car briefly so she could get in her car and leave, and you told her to pound sand, turned around and walked away.\n\nAnd finally:\n\n>I enthusiastically told my wife about my pettiness\n\nSo all in all it sounds like you have a hard-on for being 'right' as opposed to a considerate member of society.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nNext time she won\u2019t park like an a-hole\u2026 because there were consequences this time", "ESH. Yes she is obviously in the wrong but she is asking you for a favor that you could do. Whenever you see someone parked badly, don't assume it's their fault, the person on the other side might've parked badly as well, left and someone took their place. Also, what does it matter if it was her fault? She recognized she was in the wrong by your recollection and you still decided to be petty", "NTA\n\nThis is how you get society to change: make people deal with the consequences of their own actions.", "Maybe she had to park like that because of other cars parked poorly that had since left. You don't know.\n\nWho are you to judge? It wouldn't have killed you to show some kindness. YTA", "Nta", "Yta, but you weren\u2019t wrong. \n\nShe was absolutely TA first, and you appropriately responded- i would have done the same! But were your actions ass hole-ish? Yes, they were.", "Yep, you are the asshole 3000%   \nBut good for you. Sometimes the world needs that.", "If it was someone elderly, I would have moved.", "She may have parked that way because someone next to her parked badly. YTA. Kindness. It doesn\u2019t hurt anyone.", "This post highlights a big problem with the world today. We aren't a society that looks out for and cares for each other anymore, we're just s bunch of selfish, petty people cohabitating in the same general area. Yeah, she parked outside the lines. That doesn't excuse your lack of empathy and attempt at petty revenge. I'm pretty sure your conscience has already answered the question you came here to ask.", "NTA. Her behavior impacted and inconvienced many others who could not park there.  Her own actions caused her to be inconvienced. Too bad, maybe she will do better next time.", "YTA. Being \"right\" doesn't mean you have to be a dick.", "YTA. Why add to the petty assholes in the world. We already have enough. You don\u2019t know why she was parked like that. Instead of being mad at her, you need to be mad at whoever designed the parking lot.", "NTA\n\nHad you nor parked correctly you'd be propagating her error and then everyone would be parked like a$$holes.", "Yta. Could have had to park badly because someone else did. Even if not, no need to make someone else's life difficult just for the sake of it. She asked nicely. If we was an a hole then fair play but she asked nicely, you tried to ruin her day just because you could.\n\nI've has this happen to me, I don't have a disabled badge but I am disabled. I pulled my back climbing over the passenger side. I wasn't parked badly, the person next to me parked over the line, I'm guessing to not damage their car. You literally don't know what anyone else is going through so why would you make their life more difficult deliberately?", "NTA \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f \ud83d\udc4f", "YTA OP, because, quite frankly, being petty and self-righteous took more effort than being a helpful human being. People make mistakes. \n\nYou subsequently spent more time watching the struggle and your car (and probably enjoying it) than you would have by simply moving for a moment. \n\nYou could have just moved, taken the good karma, and her lesson would have still been learned. You would have done a good deed and she would have been grateful.  \n\nInstead you simply stood there and watched. \n\nBehavior like this makes the world slightly more unbearable on a day to day basis.", "NTA.\n\nIt\u2019s not your fault that she parked poorly. I\u2019ve done the exact same and squeezed in a tight gap to come back to a passive aggressive note \ud83e\udd23", "Why do they paint those pesky lines in parking lots?", "You didn't ruin her day, she ruined her own day. NTA.", "NTA I do the same thing. Im not going to not park my car just because you can't. How you get in/out is YOUR problem if you're going to park like an asshole.", "While this may be true, for all we know there was another car on her other side which had parked badly and she had to park poorly to compensate. When people park badly I always wonder if maybe someone who has since left was actually the party responsible for a chain of bad parking jobs. \n\nI\u2019d say YTA because you have no idea why they parked badly in the first place (including just a simple mistake). If you had the time to stand there the entire time she was trying to get out, then it wouldn\u2019t have hurt to just help her out. If I was the party who parked badly enough that I had to ask someone else to move so I could leave, that would have been lesson enough.", "Still seems like an asshole move to not take a minute to help out a person and also them being happy about being petty seems weird as well", "But her day was RUINED! I dont think she will come back from this, poor soul /s", "This is word for word I came here to post. Thank you.", "not sure if this is in every state but in California it\u2019s a fat ticket for parking over the handicap lines. For future reference\u2026.", "In some places, like Texas, the zebra stripes are only for van accessible when marked as such, and you'd qualify for a ticket too.", "This. I've seen this happen so many times, when one car looks like the jerk when really it was a car before them that forced them into the situation. I would say it's an assumed risk, but nonetheless, I have a feeling this is where OP's wife was coming from.", "Yep, exactly. \n\nI totally get the desire to be petty and have probably done so before. But man, wouldn\u2019t it be nice if we could all just be a little bit nicer to each other? She may have had to rearrange to park that way because of someone else. She may have had a total shit day and got a bad phone call as she was parking and had to hurry in and didn\u2019t pay attention. And yep, she may have been an asshole. Who knows? \n\nI just wish we could all be a little kinder more often than not. Maybe next time, she wouldn\u2019t have parked that way. \n\nNTA, but a reframe is a great idea.", "Totally agree. I know people enjoy a little schadenfreude and lean into \"malicious compliance\" on reddit. However, there are plenty of understandable reasons why she parked like that, and parking out of the lines is not a sign that she is a bad person who deserves this treatment. \n\nOP has no idea what her day has been like or what she is going through. Yet they still made her day harder just because they could and then bragged about it later as if they committed some praise worthy act of vigilantism. \n\nA good life lesson: It's amazing how good you feel about yourself when you are nice to other people, especially the ones who don't seem to deserve it. If OP just moved their car for a moment, they would be telling the story of how they helped someone out instead of on here wondering whether or not they are an asshole. \n\nIt costs nothing to be nice and we all need a lot more nice in our lives. NAH", "If I can't park safely without going over the lines because of some asshole in a brotruck or mercedes that believes they deserve extra space, I keep looking for a space. I don't make it the next person's problem by parking over the line. That's just spreading the poor behaviour.", "It took me way too long to find this comment of someone that thinks like me. Everyone is so quick to assume that everyone else is like this evil asshole that purposely wants to inconvenience others. Although there is a possibility that she truly didn't care and did park in a way to inconvenience people I feel like we can tell by her reaction that it may have just been a mistake Plus the whole going home and probably telling your wife about something mean you did just doesn't sit right with me", "I'm not sure where you live, but this can vary a lot depending on location as well. The scenario you've described is much more common in the UK, for example, where parking spots are much smaller than in the US. \n\nIt does sound like OP is in the US, though, because \n1) \"grocery store\";\n2) parking spots in the UK are small enough that most of the time someone parking actually *over* the line means it's actually impossible to park there.", "Exactly. OP has no idea WHY this lady was slightly over the line. It could be because she sucks at parking, for sure. Or it could be that she had to park that way b/c the car on the other side, when she pulled in, was encroaching on her spot. Maybe she did the best she could with the available space. This happens all the time.\n\n  \nEither way, you're an asshole b/c wtf? Are we as a society so devoid of consideration for our fellow humans that we think this pettiness is not only justified but is cause for laughter and gloating?\n\n  \nSome jackass is going to do something as silly and petty to you one day. Or maybe to your wife. And then you'll be all enraged. When that happens, please remember your pleasure at causing this woman inconvenience for no other reason then you could.", "Exactly, OP has no idea if it was that woman\u2019s bad parking by choice or the result of someone else\u2019s bad parking in a place that they state has so few parking opportunity\u2019s that they may not have had much option at the time. For the sake of a minute they could have just been decent and let the women get into her car and not be petty and then run home gleefully by the sounds of it to tell someone about their pettiness. YTA", "Lol don't you think this is a bit of an overreaction Why do you have so much vitriol over something that doesn't affect you? I feel like the way people respond to really small situations is a very good way to see where their mental health is at. I feel like people who get really really upset over the parking spots are probably very volatile and struggle with anger issues. you have no idea why that woman parked the way that she did so assuming that she's this huge asshole that has made it a point to inconvenience you specifically as a little weird", "But you don't think it's weird that you're unable to ignore some thing as small as the way someone else is parked?", "Lol that makes YTA if there are other spaces", "It must suck to be so petty and to care about such dumb things.", "All that aside, maybe she is just shit at parking and messed up and now needs help.  Does it really cost you much to help another human even if they are flawed?", "This is the answer. Sometimes one jackass throws off an entire line of cars, then someone 6 cars down is still there after everyone else leaves, then they look like an ahole when in reality whoever caused it is long gone.\n\nI'd say this is less common than a single bad parking job, but it happens.", "This wins.", "Don't leave your car until it's in the lines. Pretty simple", "Are you the lady that parked outside of the line?", "Learn to drive ffs. You are allowed to correct your parking you know.

Parking lots get hilarious as people follow wherever the first car parked but then it somehow goes to shit sometime during the day. It's like everyone forgets where the actual parking spots are.", "If there wasn't enough room for a normal car to park in the space and OP had to get that close to park his smaller car, I think that means that it was empty when the woman parked over the line causing the issue.  If there was a shitty parker next to her then she should have taken the open space instead of crossing over the lines.", "I can support this kind of pettiness. Taking the extra minute to get in through the passenger door seems like an appropriate punishment for uncivil parking.", "Its the fraud of the placard not the ability to park.", "Depending on the parking lot some lots only have 2-4 handicapped places all with zebra stripes so they are for anyone to use. But you are correct. If it\u2019s paved van handicapped I can only use it when needing a wheelchair.", "I agree, and you see it on the road too. Often it may look like cars parked at random and selfishly not getting close enough to one another to make room for another car, but they may have only ended up in those positions because of another vehicle that has since driven away.", "I've *been* that person and it **sucks**. I drive a full-sized truck. Sometimes I have no option, because everyone parked that way but *I* look like the jerk when I come out because they are all gone. I prefer to park where no one else does and hoof it to the door for that very reason.", "[removed]", "Sure, that's a perfectly valid way to behave, but my point is more that it's easier to assume good of other people and figure that if they're being polite about asking for help, they probably weren't maliciously parking badly, help them out, and walk away with two happy people instead of two people upset at each other. It just doesn't cost that much to assume other people are acting mostly decent in low stakes situations like this.", "That's not an option in a small parking lot like OP is describing.", "But the point isn't that she did that the point is we have no idea why she was parked that way so assuming that she's this giant asshole and then exacting revenge just leaves everyone having a negative interaction at the end of the day you have to protect your own mental health and although getting revenge on random strangers might feel good for a second I guess it really speaks to a bigger problem", "Does it, though, if it's clear the person did it intentionally?", "If you can't park correctly you don't need to be driving", "To be nice.\n\nIf he was in a great hurry, that would be an excuse for not doing so.  Instead he was giddy about his pettiness and clearly enjoyed watching her climb over the console.", "I always re-park if I\u2019m out of line, but sometimes I have to leave it that way because other people park like AH. Then the AH leaves, make me look like a idiot for parking that way. \n\nMaybe it was her, or maybe it wasn\u2019t. if OP wasn\u2019t in a hurry, why not giving her a benefit of a doubt, and helped her?", "I came here for this. So true. But then everyone sucks at that point and it's hilarious \ud83d\ude02", "What do you mean?", "Agreed. Some people like to say that it does cost time tho or whatever. This guy stayed to watch to make sure she didn\u2019t key his car so time really wasn\u2019t an issue. It would have been quicker to just pull out enough to open the door.
