As I was searching for a parking spot I saw that one was available and quickly realized why. Someone parked their car outside the lines occupying a small portion of the vacant parking spot.

I want to emphasize that I parked completely within the lines.\n\nAs I exited my car and headed towards the grocery store a woman (roughly 40F) called out to me and asked me to move my car so she can enter hers. I told her that I parked within the lines and that she can enter her car through the passenger side door. She again asked me to move my car and I said no, turned around and enter the grocery store. I then glanced outside to see her struggling to get inside her car and driving off (I wanted to make sure she doesn't key my car or anything). I just want to mention that this woman seemed like she realized she screwed herself and wasn't mean or pushy through out the whole ordeal.\n\nAs I got home, I enthusiastically told my wife about my pettiness but she said I was an asshole for doing that and that I unnecessarily ruined this woman's day.

While it's not great, it's understandable that somebody wouldn't risk scratching their vehicle or another to stay fully within the lines if somebody is already pushing over the line or whatever.\n\nGiven that, I would say that yeah, it's probably easier to just back out and be polite to the lady and have a positive interaction than to leave yourself feeling like she's some asshole who parked badly and her feeling like you're some jackass who blocked her in after she already had to squeeze into her spot because some giant truck with extended mirrors was blocking her in, or whatever the case may have been.", "No judgement because it\u2019s always possible that someone BEFORE her had parked over the line making her have to park that way.

So I pulled into the only available pump and my vehicle is just under a foot away from their driver door. Right after I start pumping gas a lady comes out to the car and sees her driver door blocked.

No. But you knew it was a dick move considering your \u201cgleeful\u201d report back to your wife. Sure, the lady was an AH but she seemed to realize it and handled her crap.

Five minutes of courtesy would have handled it. You are not required to be courteous, but you should accept it makes you an AH.", "YTA, who appointed you the parking manager? Perhaps she had been forced to park like that by a badly parked truck on the other side. Perhaps she's just a poor parker. Either way, be the bigger person and show some manners.", "YTA. First of all, you are not the parking police. Let someone else deal with shit like this.

Then YTA.. but only slightly", "YTA, she was slightly over the line. She probably didn't do it on purpose, and she asked you nicely to move before you even entered the store. You even acknowledge that the spaces are small. So your parking extra close to the line means that you've pretty much done the same thing you're upset with her for doing.

The only people who'll have much sympathy for the woman who can't play (park) within the lines are other people who can't. I'd've refused to move my car, too.", "You're both assholes. She maybe could have parked better. It made you feel big or important to 'teach her a lesson' by being horrible to her and making her 'struggle'.

Does it happen often around there?", "YTA. Being petty is just so ugly. You are clueless to why she had to park that way in the first place. Also...

Where I live that is quite common they redid all the parking lots for smaller cars and it has always caused problems. It is BS", "YTA for a few of reasons:\n\nFirstly, you don't know what the situation was when she arrived; you said yourself that the lot was full except for that one spot, maybe she was over the line to compensate for some other jackass parked several spots down.\n\nSecondly:\n\n>I have a small car and realized I could still park there provided I get very close to the parked car, blocking their driver side door, allowing me to comfortably exit through my driver side door.\n\nIf you reversed into the space instead you could have parked with your driver's side door opposite hers (and close to the vehicle on the other side), allowing you both to enter or exit your respective vehicles 'comfortably'. Instead you decided to play vigilante and made her life more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nThirdly:\n\n>She again asked me to move my car and I said no, turned around and enter the grocery store.... I just want to mention that this woman seemed like she realized she screwed herself and wasn't mean or pushy through out the whole ordeal.\n\nSo before you'd even left to go into the grocery store she calmly and reasonably asked you to move your car briefly so she could get in her car and leave, and you told her to pound sand, turned around and walked away.\n\nAnd finally:\n\n>I enthusiastically told my wife about my pettiness\n\nSo all in all it sounds like you have a hard-on for being 'right' as opposed to a considerate member of society.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nNext time she won\u2019t park like an a-hole\u2026 because there were consequences this time", "ESH.

Also it\u2019s a small parking lot (you probably didn\u2019t catch that either) so if the only parking spot was where she was forced to park over the line then it doesn\u2019t matter who parks in the spots unless you have a small car like op\u2019s only one person is going into those spots. Also (another thing you can\u2019t catch because you yourself stopped reading at \u201cparked over the line\u201d and were blinded by your personal experience which seems to not be much) is that op was able to park there \u201cwell between the lines\u201d You see when people purposely park over the line no matter how small the car you are gonna be forced to one side meaning that she probably just had like her tire on the line. Finally it\u2019s a grocery store\u2026 meaning she needed food\u2026 probably for that night, so yeah it would be pretty day ruining to not be able to park because of someone else\u2019s shitty parking and still finding a way to park where someone could park well between the lines meaning it wasn\u2019t that bad. You see this is call in-depth reading where you read the whole thing and analyze the situation. What you did is called brat reading\u2026 a tik tok kid who can\u2019t read what they don\u2019t wanna read and just skim. \ud83d\ude44", "But I have to wonder, did it *really* ruin the woman\u2019s day, or just ruin that moment when she had to crawl through the passenger seat? Too many people let too many minor things ruin their day.", "I think no matter what op is the AH just for how he handled the situation. She was nice and polite and his response to that was enthusiastically telling his wife how he made some random person who most definitely was either forced to park like that or it was an honest mistake (if they were polite they probably arnt the type to purposely park over the line) how he made them struggle and WATCHED (glanced my ass he \u201cglanced\u201d and saw the whole process of her having to crawl into the drivers seat and drive away)", "\u2026 but it\u2019s not apparent she was nice about it meaning it was probably not on purpose as no one who is being polite and not pushy probably isn\u2019t the type to park like that unless they have too", "But why?", "Yeah yours was a dick the lady was polite meaning it probably wasn\u2019t on purpose and op was just being a petty asshole I mean he doesn\u2019t have to move his car but to enthusiastically tell your wife that you didn\u2019t move your car to make the person struggle and then watch it is just fucked up", "Where does it say she was entitled?

It\u2019s not worth it to be petty like this to just be a jerk.", "\u2026 op himself says she was neither mean or pushy I think you are just projecting your own story into his where you did have to deal with an AH. If she asked once he said no, she asked twice probably like \u201cLook man I\u2019m really sorry could ya help me out\u201d and then didn\u2019t push further. If she was an AH op wouldn\u2019t be, but because op emphasizes she WASNT an asshole and emphasizes how she struggled and that he was euphoric about it makes him the AH. Like he did the opposite of most people usually they leave out details to make themselves not the AH but he put in all the details that make him the AH. Like A+ for honesty but wtf", "Acting entitled? OP even admits she wasn't mean or rude.", ">a big problem with the world today.\n\nI disagree. There are so many comments pointing out why OP is an AH that it gives me hope. As Jesus said, \"For you always have the assholes with you, but you will not always have me.\"", "Plus he had to empathize that she struggled and he was full of euphoria getting to do that like he \u201centhusiastically\u201d explained to his wife how he was an ah the way op describes this just makes me think he is not a good person", "The only people who are saying NTA are petty and shortsighted. You have no idea if the woman HAD to park like that because of another car before her. He even said that the lot is always full and there was a single spot available.", "I think op is an ah no matter what since she was nice about it but op felt he had like some power or something \u201cshe was struggling\u201d (watching her a glance isn\u2019t something long enough to someone struggle to crawl into the drivers seat and then drive away) \u201centhusiastically told my wife\u201d (This dude has read way to many r/pettyrevenge stories and just wanted to be able to do it himself) just how he words it makes him sound like an AH overly influenced by Reddit stories and wanted to live in some fucked up glory", "I mean I don\u2019t think the lady is the asshole it was most likely a mistake or something she was forced to do as people who do park over the lines on purpose are not polite, are not nice, and are pushy and annoying all traits that she didn\u2019t have", "This has happened to me more than once.  One person parks bad and everyone else has to park a little more over the line until the last one is halfway between two spots. \n\nAnd, unlike back when cars had bench seats and the stick was on the steering wheel and parking brake was on the floor,  climbing over the center divider is a pain.", "EXACTLY! This happened to me a few years ago. I had an appointment for nails (there were other stores also) and the only available spot, the vehicle on the left side had parked crookedly (sorry only way I can describe it). I parked but there was little room for the other driver to get in. About the time an old hateful AH started screaming at me that I parked wrong and he couldn\u2018t get in. I told him to wait (wish I had screamed park correctly  better next time) and I would back up but he jumped in anywaysl Turns out, he is well known to the workers for always doing this.

The price of that free space is the possibility of exactly what happened here.", "Well, if the other person parked badly, you shouldn't park there if you can't do it in the lines.", "Wrong.  The proper response there is to leave that space empty and park somewhere else, so that when the bad parker leaves, it's over.  By taking up two spaces, you're perpetuating the problem and still deserve whatever comes your way.", "I disagree.
