As I was searching for a parking spot I saw that one was available and quickly realized why. Someone parked their car outside the lines occupying a small portion of the vacant parking spot.

I want to emphasize that I parked completely within the lines.\n\nAs I exited my car and headed towards the grocery store a woman (roughly 40F) called out to me and asked me to move my car so she can enter hers. I told her that I parked within the lines and that she can enter her car through the passenger side door. She again asked me to move my car and I said no, turned around and enter the grocery store. I then glanced outside to see her struggling to get inside her car and driving off (I wanted to make sure she doesn't key my car or anything). I just want to mention that this woman seemed like she realized she screwed herself and wasn't mean or pushy through out the whole ordeal.\n\nAs I got home, I enthusiastically told my wife about my pettiness but she said I was an asshole for doing that and that I unnecessarily ruined this woman's day.

While it's not great, it's understandable that somebody wouldn't risk scratching their vehicle or another to stay fully within the lines if somebody is already pushing over the line or whatever.\n\nGiven that, I would say that yeah, it's probably easier to just back out and be polite to the lady and have a positive interaction than to leave yourself feeling like she's some asshole who parked badly and her feeling like you're some jackass who blocked her in after she already had to squeeze into her spot because some giant truck with extended mirrors was blocking her in, or whatever the case may have been.", "No judgement because it\u2019s always possible that someone BEFORE her had parked over the line making her have to park that way.

So I pulled into the only available pump and my vehicle is just under a foot away from their driver door. Right after I start pumping gas a lady comes out to the car and sees her driver door blocked.

No. But you knew it was a dick move considering your \u201cgleeful\u201d report back to your wife. Sure, the lady was an AH but she seemed to realize it and handled her crap.

Five minutes of courtesy would have handled it. You are not required to be courteous, but you should accept it makes you an AH.", "YTA, who appointed you the parking manager? Perhaps she had been forced to park like that by a badly parked truck on the other side. Perhaps she's just a poor parker. Either way, be the bigger person and show some manners.", "YTA. First of all, you are not the parking police. Let someone else deal with shit like this.

Then YTA.. but only slightly", "YTA, she was slightly over the line. She probably didn't do it on purpose, and she asked you nicely to move before you even entered the store. You even acknowledge that the spaces are small. So your parking extra close to the line means that you've pretty much done the same thing you're upset with her for doing.

The only people who'll have much sympathy for the woman who can't play (park) within the lines are other people who can't. I'd've refused to move my car, too.", "You're both assholes. She maybe could have parked better. It made you feel big or important to 'teach her a lesson' by being horrible to her and making her 'struggle'.

Does it happen often around there?", "YTA. Being petty is just so ugly. You are clueless to why she had to park that way in the first place. Also...

Where I live that is quite common they redid all the parking lots for smaller cars and it has always caused problems. It is BS", "YTA for a few of reasons:\n\nFirstly, you don't know what the situation was when she arrived; you said yourself that the lot was full except for that one spot, maybe she was over the line to compensate for some other jackass parked several spots down.\n\nSecondly:\n\n>I have a small car and realized I could still park there provided I get very close to the parked car, blocking their driver side door, allowing me to comfortably exit through my driver side door.\n\nIf you reversed into the space instead you could have parked with your driver's side door opposite hers (and close to the vehicle on the other side), allowing you both to enter or exit your respective vehicles 'comfortably'. Instead you decided to play vigilante and made her life more difficult than it needed to be.\n\nThirdly:\n\n>She again asked me to move my car and I said no, turned around and enter the grocery store.... I just want to mention that this woman seemed like she realized she screwed herself and wasn't mean or pushy through out the whole ordeal.\n\nSo before you'd even left to go into the grocery store she calmly and reasonably asked you to move your car briefly so she could get in her car and leave, and you told her to pound sand, turned around and walked away.\n\nAnd finally:\n\n>I enthusiastically told my wife about my pettiness\n\nSo all in all it sounds like you have a hard-on for being 'right' as opposed to a considerate member of society.", "NTA", "NTA.\n\nNext time she won\u2019t park like an a-hole\u2026 because there were consequences this time", "ESH.

Also it\u2019s a small parking lot (you probably didn\u2019t catch that either) so if the only parking spot was where she was forced to park over the line then it doesn\u2019t matter who parks in the spots unless you have a small car like op\u2019s only one person is going into those spots. Also (another thing you can\u2019t catch because you yourself stopped reading at \u201cparked over the line\u201d and were blinded by your personal experience which seems to not be much) is that op was able to park there \u201cwell between the lines\u201d You see when people purposely park over the line no matter how small the car you are gonna be forced to one side meaning that she probably just had like her tire on the line. Finally it\u2019s a grocery store\u2026 meaning she needed food\u2026 probably for that night, so yeah it would be pretty day ruining to not be able to park because of someone else\u2019s shitty parking and still finding a way to park where someone could park well between the lines meaning it wasn\u2019t that bad. You see this is call in-depth reading where you read the whole thing and analyze the situation. What you did is called brat reading\u2026 a tik tok kid who can\u2019t read what they don\u2019t wanna read and just skim. \ud83d\ude44", "But I have to wonder, did it *really* ruin the woman\u2019s day, or just ruin that moment when she had to crawl through the passenger seat?

If she was an AH op wouldn\u2019t be, but because op emphasizes she WASNT an asshole and emphasizes how she struggled and that he was euphoric about it makes him the AH.

I had an appointment for nails (there were other stores also) and the only available spot, the vehicle on the left side had parked crookedly (sorry only way I can describe it).

A normal car would have just continued in an endless loop lol", "This is always the case at my grocery store, literally last time I went we were parking and the guy we just stopped who was hobbling slowly to his car got to it def after we parked and I opened my door slightly but stopped turned around and checked on my kid in that time he got to his car and opened the door hitting mine then started talking shit, like dude you just got here and was already parked like a dick.", "Agreed, YTA. Also, although I have at last learned that it is better not to go through life being the kind of person who goes through life hardening yourself up in order to \"teach other people lessons\". \n\nI spent years being angry at people who didn't get over when they knew that a lane was going to close up ahead. I would try to keep people out who tried to get in at the last minute. Then I learned that \"zipper merging\" at the point where the lane finally closed was actually the best traffic management pattern for everyone, and people like me screwed things up the most, even more than those opportunists who stayed in the faster lane as long as possible and merged at that last minute.\n\nShe shouldn't have parked over the line, and you didn't need to wait outside until she got back, but since you were right there when she called to you, deliberately walking away instead of helping her out was an asshole move.\n\nWe aren't here to teach people out of our resentment. It doesn't do any good.", "I frequent a garage in a hospital where there is always a domino of over the line cars.  \n\nMore importantly, i always vote YTA when a grown ass adult feels a need to \"teach a lesson\" to another grown ass adult. The motivation is not pure.", "Even so, that's not OP's problem. Going within the lines is ensuring you don't further propagate the original shit park, regardless of where it came from. It's civic duty lol", "Right? I wonder if he's married and how he settles arguments or disagreements with his spouse.", "Three lefts do.", "Have you ever been to a Trader Joe\u2019s? They seem to intentionally design tiny parking lots where people have to go round and round until someone leaves. I won\u2019t go there any more because of that.", "This is the significant part of the post.  How long would it have taken OP to pull his car out so she could access her driver's door, then pull forward again?  I' thinking less the=an 60 seconds.\n\nYet OP spent close to 60 seconds just watching so his car wouldn't be damaged.\n\nIf I was the GF, I'd be seeing a red flag in the anecdote he's so proud about.", "Of course we realize this. It's just not so blatant here, and we save our acts of petty revenge to embarrass people who make children cry, fat shame people, even then, I just want people to stop talking to prevent more damage being done. \n\nTo actually make people think, you usually need to have an empathetic, 2-way sharing conversation or write something they read or listen to in a receptive mode. There usually isn't that opportunity. Punishment and judgemental looks just bring about defensive reactions.", "I assumed OP was talking about a Trader Joe\u2019s TBH. lol. The over the line parkers happen to me in that parking lot way more than others.", "Ha I was thinking Trader Joe\u2019s too.  I could never figure out if it was the people or the parking lot.  \n\nI\u2019ve also seen it happen at co-ops, lol.", "Or in parking lots where the slots are so narrow that everyone must park absolutely centered between the lines in order to squeeze in and out. Someone trying to park one of those huge pickups or SUVs with a name like eXtreme will throw everyone off for days.", "It\u2019s only easy if you\u2019re able bodied.", "This is honestly the reason I will avoid being the driver at all costs lol I'm just gonna cost us more time re-parking and piss everyone else off. I'll handle snacks, music, and maps instead.", "I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019ve been kicked around in this life. It\u2019s not fair that you\u2019ve been punished for trying to be a good person and that\u2019s left you feeling defensive in encounters with others. If we were all attempting to be kind (or at least not actively being a prick), you\u2019d probably have a different perspective. \n\nThis isn\u2019t pity, BTW. I\u2019ve known people who have been backstabbed and betrayed, or just been ground down by dealing with horrible strangers, and they changed from the kindest and best of people to being exhausted and bitter about the world. It sucks and I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m a \u201csoft\u201d person but I\u2019ve developed a thick skin (and thankfully was born with a good bullshit detector) because of all the awfulness in our world. My MO is \u201ckind but cautious.\u201d Reading about OP being gleeful and proud of his pettiness and seeing so many people cheering his actions, hurts my heart. Best wishes to you.", "As another bigger dude, I wouldn\u2019t have parked like an AH. If the way I parked results in me not being able to enter my driver\u2019s side door, it\u2019s my own fault.", "That sounds so wild to me. I live in the Canadian Prairies, and they have to repaint the lines in my city pretty much every year.", "Do you feel better for being such a condescending arsehole? That was very passive-aggressive for someone trying oh so hard to be 'kind but cautious'.", "Thank you!!", "If there was another car, then her parking like that makes it someone else\u2019s problem and she\u2019s *still* a jerk for doing it.", "And her's weren't?If there was another car parked like an AH that prevented her from properly parking within the lines, then as much as it sucks, its her responsibility to find another place she can park properly. Two wrongs dont make a right.\n\nAnd before you say anything, No, what OP did was not wrong. He properly and legally parked within the lines of a designated parking space. He cannot be held responsible for somebody else's inability to properly drive or park.", "Being in a rush isn't an excuse to be a d bag. And it's hard not to notice when you get off your vehicle. Too many people park like d bags and are just lazy to fix it.", "You can be 'right' and still be an AH.", "That\u2019s what it is. All these people that think OP is the AH park like the double parked lady. They can\u2019t handle criticism. \ud83d\ude02"]}
