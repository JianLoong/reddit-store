Also SIL needs a talking to and to profusely apologize for overstepping your boundaries. \n\nIf you want to take a Christmas off from seeing her by all means do.

She didn\u2019t do what you wanted to do, she did what she wanted you to have and SIL jumped on the bandwagon with her mother and decided you needed your mother at your party.  Neither of them gave a crap about what you wanted.  They felt you needed to have what they wanted.  This wasn\u2019t for you, it was for them.\n\nYou and your husband and your daughter are your own little family unit.  You need to do what is good for your family unit.  MIL and everyone else is extended family.  Your needs come before everyone else\u2019s desires.\n\nI would suggest the following.  First, your husband needs to set both MIL and SIL straight on they overstepped created a traumatic event for you when you didn\u2019t want it to being with.  This is in MIL and SIL, and you can\u2019t tell me that MIL didn\u2019t know your other was coming.  BS on that.  SIL at have been the one to actually invite your mother, but MIL knew about it and decided to throw SIL under the bus when it all blew up.  Your husband needs to say this to them and make it clear that they were irresponsible and selfish and they both owe you a huge apology.  And it\u2019s an apology about their bad conduct, not your hurt feelings.  And there are consequences for their bad behavior,  the consequences are that you, hubby, and daughter are spending Christmas at home with your own little family unit.  That you and your daughter have been traumatized enough by them and you are spending A quiet Christmas at home.  MIL and SIL need to reflect on their bad behavior and them assuming that they what is best for someone else.  They don\u2019t and they proved it with the birthday party fiasco.\n\nActions have consequences.  Hopefully they can learn from this.\n\nYour husband has to deliver this message, and be polite, but firm with them on what they did wrong and what the consequences are for their actions.  No negotiating.\n\nHope this helps.", "ESH to varying degrees.\n\nSIL is the biggest asshole. Knowing somebody is NC/LC and then violating that boundary as a surprise is never okay. Plus she didn't apologize. Remain NC with SIL - she was actively trying to set you up.\n\nMIL less so. She knew you didn't want a party, but didn't understand how much trauma you have in your background around birthdays. She didn't invite your mom and agreed that was inappropriate. She has apologized, but I don't like how she swung it back on you the moment you said you still weren't ok.\n\nAs for you, I understand why you feel violated by in-laws, but a gesture of understanding and good faith towards MIL might be appropriate since this doesn't seem like it was her fault. Maybe you don't attend Christmas but still reach out to her with some kind words? Because right now it seems like you're blaming her for something SIL did, which is a slight bit assholish. But make no mistake, you are the broader victim here.\n\nMom is obviously massive AH, to the point where this doesn't even need acknowledging.", "Info: Is your SIL going to be a the Christmas celebration?

Before I ever went there again, I would ask how they make sure your SIL (who has to know about the abused you had to endure at \"home\") will never do something that hurtful again. I would make sure that for the time being there can't be any contact with SIL - she was the one who did this, and I don't believe for a second she did not know how that would hurt you.", "NTA I hate when people can't take no for an answer.

Your not the asshole in the fact that if you don\u2019t want to celebrate your birthday, that should be respected. Whats hard about it though is that people like to show they love and care about someone by celebrating their birthday. I\u2019m one of those people, and find it really difficult to comprehend how somebody wouldn\u2019t want to celebrate. My partner is more like you though. 7 years in and I still struggle with the concept. \n\nIt sounds like the whole thing has brought back negative emotions for you, understandably, and now you\u2019re putting your guard up to protect yourself by putting preventative measures in place, so \u2018cancelling\u2019 Christmas. \n\nI think you\u2019re the asshole in the fact that Christmas shouldn\u2019t be affected by this, however I don\u2019t actually think you\u2019re an asshole in this situation. You\u2019re just hurting. Remember though, this was a one odd situation, out of anyone\u2019s control, and the only person to hurt you is the same person as in your past\u2026 your mum. \n\nYour in laws are NOT your mum. They will not hurt you like your mum did. They are trying to give you the family life you deserved as a child but didn\u2019t get. It\u2019s hard to except that, and it just opens old wounds. Try not to push them away though, as in the end you\u2019re only hurting yourself and your little family. \n\nI think you should go for Christmas, but explain to your MIL how you felt/ feel. Best of luck", "Ah this is hard. Your in laws didn\u2019t know about the reasons behind you not celebrating your birthday, they were trying to do something nice for you and it wasn\u2019t them that ruined the day\u2026 had your mother not been there, it may well have been a lovely day. \n\nI don\u2019t think you\u2019re wrong for being upset by the situation, but I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to cut off your in laws over this.

Perhaps they felt you were hiding something and infact you were the 'evil' one within the family. Perhaps also, because their family is all sweet and roses, that they expect every other family to be and find it difficult to believe otherwise.\n\nLike you, I am from a similar background. I do not celebrate Bday's either. nor do I talk to my family. I can completely understand why you dont.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe in-laws are also the 'big A' for going behind your back and not respecting your wishes.
