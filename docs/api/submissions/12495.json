If your parents tragically pass, suddenly, who will be responsible for providing care for your brother? This is something that should be heavily planned already.

He's paying for how he treated YOU. You were family all along and he didn't care until he had a use for you. IMO there is always some time, some energy, some love to give to all your children if you actually want to make the effort. They didn't.\n\nI'd also argue that if he's talking about \"paying\" for it, you have paid in advance.

You can help them look at options while being adamant that he can not stay with you.", "NAH\n\nIt's understandable that your parents had to devote so much energy to caregiving for your brother. It's also understandable that you do not want to take on this burden as an adult. Your parents should consider looking into a group home for him if they are getting older and they may not be able to care for him indefinitely, especially if they see you as the fall back plan.", "NTA- It's ironic that he says you will pay for how you acted towards him and the family but isn't that what's happening to him right now? They chose to put all their effort into one child and left the other on their own. Now that you're of use to them they want your help and you're the bad guy for saying no.", "NTA", "NTA", "YNTA.  You deserve to have a life.  If your parent/s are that strapped, maybe they need to look at getting him into a day program (at least).  Something where he'd have security during the day, but perhaps even learn some skills and have a variety of social interactions.   I don't buy the idea that because someone chose to have a baby, you owe them everything they ask for.  No way.", "NTA\n\nIf your dad is retired but still needs work/money, then he can't afford to give your brother a good quality of life. I'm taking retirement to mean that your father is elderly. The elderly can't handle what they used to be able to. \n\nGiving your father money will only perpetuate the problem.\n\nIf you decide to spend any money, it would be best used to find out what help your brother can get for the rest of his life. Find out what he qualifies for. A group home situation would have people trained to both deal with negative behaviors and give him a a quality of life. He could be happy and have an environment that gives him interaction/fulfillment on his ways that he can accept them.", "I think you should write them a letter telling them exactly how you feel.", "NTA, they don\u2019t get to come around asking for help when you were ignored. My mom has a disabled sister so I see first hand how she always comes first yet my grandparents expect the other siblings to step in when they barely were involved with anyone else. It has gotten to the point they are only nice to certain siblings because they are trying to convince them to take my disabled aunt in when they pass. No one can provide her with the care she needs and they are pissed.", "YTA. You got a band hand but your brother got so much worse. Your brother is mentally handicapped but you chose to be emotionally handicapped.", "I\u2019m leaning towards YTA- you haven\u2019t described anything that your family actually did to you, other than focus on your brother which there was nothing else to do if he is in need of constant care. Of course the focus is on him. It\u2019s understandable that you would feel a little neglected as a child but as an adult you should now be able to look back and understand that. It also seems like you have something against your brother, if he is able to do most things by himself and just can\u2019t be alone I don\u2019t see why you wouldn\u2019t let him stay with you. We\u2019re either missing a lot of information here or you just don\u2019t like your family for no real reason", "Slight YTA, you don't have to help your family if you don't want to, BUT just based on what was said in your post you were harsh. I understand growing up with a special needs brother and feeling like no one cared about you. Your parents had to attend to him more due to his disabilities. As an adult you should understand they probably did all that they could. I think you were really harsh in how you told him no.", "As the parent of a \"normal\" (okay, they change the terminology every six months, and I think the current acceptable PC term is \"neurotypical\") child (33m) and another child who is profoundly disabled (intellectually and physically) (almost 32m) - so basically your same family situation - I'm going to call BS here and say YTA.  \n\n\nWe do not struggle with money in our household, but obviously that's not true of every family in this predicament.  \n\n\nTo suggest that you were \"pretty much invisible\" to your parents is YOUR PERCEPTION.  I can almost guarantee that was not the case.  However, the amount of care required by a handicapped child - and, I might add, who is in this condition by no fault of his own or anyone else's, it's just the luck of the draw - is immense and exhausting.  For you to judge your parents so harshly is cruel and selfish.  You might benefit from some counseling.  But I digress.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI will say this: It would probably behoove your parents to place your brother in a group home, as we have done with our younger son.  But that takes time and planning.  In the meantime, it wouldn't kill you to help out.  For you to just give your father a flat refusal shows no compassion at all, either for your parents or your sibling.  \n\n\nYTA, absolutely.", "Amazing. You took a legitimate concern and managed to figure out a way to be a complete fucking asshole about it.\n\nYTA.", "NTA but it\u2019s time for them to look into group homes.  Sometimes the wait list is long so the sooner the better.", "YTA- doesn\u2019t family mean anything anymore? They may not have been perfect parents, but sounds like they tried their best, never starved you or beat you and probably were completely exhausted and drowning while raising your special needs sibling. Sounds like it took all their time and money, must have sucked for them. What should they have done?

It's not that your parents didn't/don't care; it's that your brother needs *constant* care. That you can help but refuse to because you're jealous of how much time they spent on him is crappy.

Your brother also likely receives benefits on behalf of your brother, which could include support services.  \n\nIf your parents didn't create a fund to help support your brother during their working years, haven't looked into resources available to them, and/or retired without sufficient funds to pay all family expenses (which may be part of the problem), those are their issues to solve.\n\nYou aren't able to put your career and life on hold to take over Mom and Dad's responsibilities.", "The father's statement makes him the AH.", "Out of curiosity, what makes you think that just because she doesn\u2019t want to be her brother\u2019s care taker, that she has something against him?

What\u2019s cruel is having 2 kids and being negligent towards one over the other disabled or not , I\u2019m so happy my mom doesn\u2019t pull sh*t like this on me with my autistic brother, your kids aren\u2019t the responsibility of your other kids , you decided to have the kid and signed up to be said child caretaker as soon as the child was born , their siblings didn\u2019t , knowing their kid had disabilities they should\u2019ve had something planned for him other than dumping him into her hands and expecting her to be okay with it & after being negligent towards her in her childhood they expected help ?

She didn\u2019t even seem sympathize towards her dad just trying to care for his son. Didn\u2019t offer any reason why she didn\u2019t want her brother there. I\u2019m just getting a general vibe from her wording that she really doesn\u2019t like her family but hasn\u2019t really given any reason other than the fact that she has a disabled brother who they focused on. It just seems like she\u2019s a little resentful towards her brother but that\u2019s not his fault so it doesn\u2019t seem fair. Of course she\u2019s not obligated to take care of him, but it was just the response that made it seem pretty cold towards them.

She doesn\u2019t owe them shit, but she asked to be judged and I\u2019m just saying it\u2019s kinda an AH move to not care. He is her brother", "They never cared for how hard it was to her and all of a sudden want to be close when they need something, like I said , there\u2019s programs they can put the brother in and that can help them with him , it is not her job to look after him or financially support them , they came to her for her to be a caregiver and get handouts while they did nothing to earn those things in the first place ."]}
