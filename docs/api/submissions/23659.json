I have PCOS, endo insulin resistance blocked tube, mening I don't ovulate on my own, and need medical help. 15 years tried to conceive with Clomid and shots I\u2019ve never been pregnant. I've been given very low success chance due to all my problems for IVF\n\nThe issue:3 years ago my sister got pregnant without issue.It caught me off guard (Because Asperger I need some time to get used to things, and then I'm fine) So initially, I didn\u2019t seem happy with it, I was, but I was not able to express it beside the usual congratulations. I was there for the gender, and I was there for the birth, and I really was happy for her, even though I was in emotional pain myself, I love my nieceIn the last 3 years I was still struggling, and my sister told me she is willing to carry my baby, it\u2019s a big process, I know all the struggles involved with it. I did start to see it as my last resort, IF before I get 40 (cutoff limit for help) it wouldn\u2019t work myself, she was my last resort to have a baby. I hung on to that, it gave me the strength to keep going\n\n3 months ago I went to an event with mother and sister. We decided to do dinner that night, we talked about babies and pregnancy, she suddenly said: \u201coh yeah, I am not going to carry your child anymore, I thought more, and it\u2019s too much for me\u201d I didn\u2019t really react, as I need time to process, it was a enormous blow, and to be honest I wasn\u2019t sure how to react, so I was silent. We arrived, and I wasn\u2019t really thinking straight so I didn\u2019t say much. We ordered the mixed grill. Waiter left, and suddenly sister says: \u201c oh wait, we need waiter back, I can\u2019t have red meat\u201d It didn\u2019t click with me yet, until she said \u201chihi I am pregnant again, I didn\u2019t want to tell you here, but oh well\" Here is where I showed a reaction, I couldn\u2019t process wtf just happened, I felt the sudden pain of pulling out of what she said,and then this news, my last resort to become a mom was shattered. I lost it a bit, I put earplugs in, because it got loud. I remember I said congratulations. Food came, She said: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to tell you like this, but what was I supposed to do\u201d And I said \u201cfuck you\u201dShe left, and I am being shunned like a horrible person, because \u201ceveryone\u2019s sister can be happy when a sibling gets pregnant, and you can\u2019t, you are horrible\u201dI did apologize afterwards, but it never got back to the way it was, to be very honest, I feel hurt and lost, and I feel terrible they're all saying it\u2019s all my fault. Through my process the last couple years, she never asked how I'm doing, never asked how I'm coping. She only said she's tired of walking on eggshells around me, she just wants to enjoy her pregnancy.

You are 1000000% justified for feeling disappointed. You wanted this so badly and it really stings and your feelings of hurt are valid. However, your sister is not an AH for going back on her offer. Surrogacy is a HUGE burden and requires a great deal of emotional, physical, and financial turmoil. Having the ability to decide and change our mind about how are bodies are used is one of the most important human rights we have. \n\nYou're not the AH for being disappointed, you're the AH for how you processed that disappointment. You should apologize and tell her that you were struggling to process your happiness against your own disappointment, but you shouldn't have said what you said.", "It for sure wasn't helpful. Your sister is allowed to change her mind about her body and what she can/will do. I also sympathize with you being upset, and wanting to be a mother very badly, but there are other surrogates it doesn't have to be your sister. I imagine she's not asked how you're doing and if you're okay because you're wearing your emotions more on your shoulder then you realized. She stated she doesn't want to walk around on eggshells around you and I think that speaks a bit to her feelings. I don't think you should've told her to F Off but I do understand the hurt and anger. Give your sister some space to process and give yourself that space as well.", "YTA. I get that it's hard and I do think your sister could have been more tactful. But your sister is not an AH for deciding against being your surrogate.", "YTA.  You are not entitled to anyone\u2019s body. Especially when it pertains to pregnancy. You\u2019re sister has every right to say no and still have 10 more of her own pregnancies. \n\nInfertility is hard and it sounds like what you need is to talk to a professional about it who can help you sort your feelings. The fact that you counted on your sister\u2019s body is not ok. It\u2019s upsetting, I do get that, but her body is her own to do with what she will. And you shouldn\u2019t be shaming her for that.\n\nEdit: I want to add. Your sister could have handled telling you better. But I get the feeling is that this is more about the internal feelings you are having seeing this last option slip away for a biological child. I think therapy will really help.", "YTA - soft but still the verdict\n\nBecoming a surrogate is not something that should be taken lightly. On top of being pregnant you also increase your mortality risk also. I firmly believe that people should have the right to go back on their agreement in this scenario just because of how much of a burden the whole process is. \n\nYour sister is not the only person who can provide you with a baby. You have more options out there. Had you considered adoption at all?", "I'm so sorry for what you're going through. I've been trying for a year and a half and it's been terribly difficult, I can't even imagine going through it for 15 years.\n\nHowever, in this situation YTA\n\nThe whole \"I won't be your surrogate anymore\" could have been handled with more care by her, she didn't deal with it as she should have. But besides that, the only thing she's guilty of is being able to get pregnant and you are an AH for telling her fu for that.\n\nI know it's hard. I've seen people close to me get pregnant while I'm trying and trying and can't and it's a mixture of being genuinely happy for them and wanting to burst out into tears, but I put the tears away while I'm with them and be happy for them, and when I get home I burst into tears.\n\nYour sister is not to blame for your problems conceiving. In what way do you think you were justified?", "ESH here.\n\nYour sister mangled this, utterly. Not only rescinding her offer at a family dinner, but rescinding it at the same time as a family announcement is incredibly callous. \u2018I didn\u2019t want to tell you like this but what could I do.\u2019 Many, many things, including having a private discussion with you, separately, for both pieces of news. I\u2019m not surprised you reacted badly. For that reason she is an AH.\n\nHowever, it sounds to me like this wasn\u2019t a discussed and agreed upon thing, but something that was suggested and not talked about afterwards. Her saying \u2018I thought about this more,\u2019 suggests to me not much thinking and planning has gone on. You cannot hold people to this. Surrogacy is a huge thing, and bodily autonomy is important\n\nShe is also allowed to grow her own family, and enjoy her pregnancy. You say she hasn\u2019t given you support but it doesn\u2019t sound like you supported her last pregnancy much. You\u2019ve been an AH too. You cannot hold the idea that she is the one chance at having a baby over her. For one thing it\u2019s not true. Other surrogates exist, and ones without so much mess and obligation attached. I do wish you the best of luck in becoming a mother.", "YTA, you\u2019re not an AH for being disappointed but it doesn\u2019t justify you swearing at her like that. \n\nI\u2019m autistic, sometimes I say things I shouldn\u2019t and apologise. But that doesn\u2019t mean people will instantly accept it or be ok with my behaviour. It doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not an AH at times either. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re going through this, I\u2019m sorry that you\u2019re grieving for the child you might not have. I\u2019m sorry you are suffering and that hearing the news of the surrogacy offer was so hard. \n\nIt sounds like your sister has been trying (and ended up feeling like she\u2019s walking on egg shells), and maybe she needs some time. \n\nI\u2019d try apologising again, maybe cook dinner for her or something. And try spending some quality time together if she is ok with that.", "Your sister has her own life and it happened that she got pregnant.  Its wonderful. Also she changed her mind to carry a child and give him/her away. Its within her right to adjust her plans with time, or change her mind.", "YTA. She has a right to change her mind, and she also has the right to have more children. I understand that you're disappointed in the situation, and rightfully so. You're not an AH for your feelings. You're an AH for treating your sister this way.", "YTA but I understand you must be in a lot of pain. I don\u2019t think your reaction should be surprising because you have struggled a lot with this situation. But at the end of the day nobody owes you their body to incubate a child; every time you get pregnant and carry a child you literally risk your life. It could be that she didn\u2019t expect to get pregnant again and she realized she couldn\u2019t handle the physical toll of going through it a third time for your sake.\n\nIm pregnant for the first time and understand how people might not be able to physically handle it more than once. It takes everything you\u2019ve got. \n\nIm sorry, but it is her right and she probably didn\u2019t mean to hurt you with the double news as much as she was giving you the likely reason why she wouldn\u2019t be able to do it for you anymore. But hearing both things at the same time must certainly have been painful.", "I hope you find your peace", "Your sister has a right to change her mind. It probably deserved a dedicated, private, sit-down conversation and not just a throwaway comment at dinner before \"accidentally\" telling you that she's pregnant. But that was a strong and unwarranted response. ESH, and I hope you can both see each other's position, forgive, and move on.", "Sorry for your situation but soft YTA. She could handle both announcements bit better. But your infertility is not her fault nor responsibility. And she feels she had to walk on eggshells around you because of situation (your struggles + asperger). She does deserve enjoy her pregnancy and maybe first time around she felt like she couldn't because she had to be extra considered/minimize talking about it and enjoying it because of you?", "I tried to edit with some clarification, but then I go over character limit, and then my post doesn't make sense?  \n\n\nAnyway... I see some comments on how surrogacy was discussed. She first opted it after her first born, I was very receptive to the suggestion ( I didn't ask her, she came with it herself) because of my troubles, after her initial suggestion we had several more talks, about her emotion to the potential child, her role in it, what DNA material to use ( my own egg plus my partners seed) all these talks happened over several months, sometimes more discussion then others, I felt that it was serious, and not just mentioned in passing, but perhaps I misjudged that too, I'm not known for picking up hints easily.  \n\n\nto the comments saying there are other surragates.  \nI am from a country where advertising for one is not allowed, you are not allowed to pay for one either, it's illegal. The process itself is not, but you need to find a surrogate yourself. Its a very vague area, many couples go to other countries to buy a surrogate, but I read a lot of horror stories from it, and would prefer not to go that route.  \nAdoption is a possibility, however I would prefer a biological child.\n\nI do understand my sister has her own body autonomy, and she can opt out whenever she wants. When I gave that response, it all just ebcame to much for me, first saying no to being a surrogate while we walked to the restaurant, and then minutes after laughingly saying oh i'm also pregnant. Maybe I am just being way too sensitive, I honestly don't even know why I said fu to her, it's just all that came out at that point, she was being happy and cheery while my world just felt crushed", "YTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is pregnant, and not everything is about YOU.", "sorry for your situation, but YTA in this case. Your sister isn't really doing anything wrong. She gets to decide what to do with her body.\n\nYour sister could have handled it better though. For example, she could have just announced her pregnancy, which would automatically mean she can't be pregnant for you at the same time. She didn't really have to rescind the offer. She could have waited until the new baby is born, and then say \"sorry it's just too much, I can't do this a third time\". \n\nInstead she rescinded the offer, claimed that it was \"too much\" even though she was currently pregnant. So I can see why you had a strong reaction given your condition. I would still say you were in the wrong though.", "NTA, when you have a sibling who is an aspie, you know how they respond to situations. Ofc you are jealous, going through 15 years of ttc will do that to you. Your sister sounded smug af, no tact at all, and certainly no remorse. It might be expected from a stranger, but she has known you all her life, and she just glanced over it all in such a way she KNEW it would devastate you.  I don\u2019t understand all these people focusing so much on the surrogacy, because I don\u2019t believe your post is about that all. It\u2019s about the way you got all that info, and how you coped with it. Best of luck to you.", "NTA, she handled that terribly", "NTA! I see some, at least, people are questioning the OP's potential bias, but I don't think that really amounts to much in this situation. I presume that everybody involved is familiar with OP's situation, so 'taking back' the offer to carry a baby, IN THE SAME CONVERSATION as announcing her own pregnancy, is a huge DICK move regardless of mental status! It certainly may be RUDE to tell her to F-off, but in no way uncalled for.", "you are NTA.\n\nyour sister just betrayed you in the worst way possible and with a smug attitude. your response was appropriate.", "Oh I so feel for you. Not only has she crushed your dreams but did it in such a casual, ambivalent manner. Hateful behaviour. You\u2019re certainly NTA but she, & everyone who\u2019s having a go at you most certainly are.

Just for reference though, it can be justified and you can still be an A for it.  Being a surrogate is a huge ask and it can be rescinded at any time for any reason.  You were the one that decided to wait, not her.  It is exhausting to grow up in the shadow of your sibling because you don't know how your sibling will react or what drama will occur.  I am guessing that is the reason she does not ask.  Once you get away from that feeling, you really do not want to open the door again.  She slipped and said something that would have indicated she was pregnant and so she admitted it.  People slip up all the time especially when adjusting to a recently changed situation (is on her second kid and not showing, so she probably was not that far along in her pregnancy and still remembering rules).  A therapist before having a baby might be a good idea as how are you going to manage a kid's behavior, tweens behavior, and teens behavior when they say things?", "NTA.\n\nYour sister volunteered to be your surrogate then changed her mind without bothering to take the time to talk to you about it.  Even if you weren't autistic, that's a pretty nasty move and a lot to process.  Then she casually slips that she's pregnant at dinner?  Just after telling you she's not going to be your surrogate??  Shameful, callous and cowardly.  \n\nSo I have questions.  Was your sister and her partner just being careless with birth control or did they decide to have another baby and not bother to consider their promise to you?  Did she ever even intend to be your surrogate in the first place?  Either way your sister had the audacity to rip away your dreams due to carelessness or heartlessness.

So most couples that do decide that route go through other countries, with a lot of other risks involved. I guess I never really fully realized her comment, I try not to let it show, but seems that's not really working", "She isn't the AH for that. She's the AH for casually just throwing it our there, randomly at a dinner.

Except it won't be too difficult since I'm fine having another kid.\" \n\nThe people voting y t a are admitting that they don't think your sister did anything wrong by the pain she knowingly caused you.", "NTA your sister dumped two big emotional blows in front of the entire family and expected you to just brush it off that is an asshole move.", "ESH. She's not TA for not going through with the surrogacy, or for being pregnant and you're not TA for being disappointed. You both fucked up the social aspect of this though. She relayed all of that information to you in the worst way possible and she must have known that it would be hard news for you. I don't know if I'm reaching here, but the whole forgetting she could eat red meat thing seems a bit suspect as well. You obviously shouldn't have reacted the way you did.", "You are NTA for your reaction in this terrible situation, because it is a lot to take in for anyone and your sister was so blaze about it it\u2019s bordering on rude. I think you acknowledged that you were wrong by apologizing, but she is not obligued to accept your apology and sadly it might take a while. \n\nHowever Y T A if you are and continue to be angry about her going back on her offer. As lots of people commented, surrogacy is such a big deal and your sister is allowed to reconsider. But i understand you\u2018re seeking judgement about the FU response at dinner and not because you want to get confirmation for feeling angry", "NTA. Your sister was COLD. Pregnancy doesn't give you a free pass to be heartless.", "The way this AH sister handled it makes her a major AH. She could have gently told the op that she was pregnant when they were alone instead of gloating over it at a restaurant.", "I feel like anyone who is writing YTA hasn't gone through fertility issues.  They get all wrapped up in whether the sister is an AH for changing her mind about the surrogacy when that really isn't the point.  The OP asked if she was an AH for telling her sister F.U..  Yeah no, not an AH for that and frankly, sister is lucky that's all she got. The sister outright annihilated the OP by how she handled this.", "Ok. Thank you for explaining here. \n\nSo here\u2019s my thoughts. \n\nUntil there was a definitive \u201clet\u2019s schedule a day for an embryo transfer\u201d it was still all hypothetical. It was really nice of her to offer and I did see in your post or a comment where you accused her of not being supportive of you. I would argue that offering to potentially be a surrogate was her being very supportive. \n\nHowever time has passed. No firm plans where made and she changed her mind. \n\nDo I think she should have talked to you in private. Yes. So I understand that you where really hurt that the offer had been rescinded. And as humans when you have that kind of news it probably made you feel raw because that is something that despite knowing in your head \u201cmy sister has bodily autonomy and doesn\u2019t need to be a surrogate\u201d and then find out immediately afterwards that she is pregnant just made your cup run over. \n\nHowever. You\u2019re right. Saying FU to your sister was over the line. It clearly came from upset. But I think this is where you need to work on things. You need to go to therapy. Infertility is really emotionally and mentally and physically hard. You are spread really thin. And you need to be dealing with these feelings. Because when you don\u2019t you lash out because you\u2019re so fried it just can\u2019t stay in anymore. And I suspect because you\u2019re sister feels like she has always had to walk on eggshells with her pregnancies that the people around you are seeing your upset very clearly. So a part of me wonders if your sister just also reached her breaking point. She wants to be excited and happy and not tiptoe. And as such maybe she was more callous with her timing than she should have been. \n\nMy parents struggled with infertility for 6 years before I was born. And where starting to look into adoption/foster care when they found out I was on the way. So I understand that this is something very hard and difficult and having this all happen at once probably made you angry. The problem is that those are internal emotions that stem from a very specific place. So your sister saying she\u2019s no longer ok with being a surrogate and is pregnant shouldn\u2019t have (if this weren\u2019t so charged) made you so mad you wanted to lash out. \n\nNow I understand you want to experience having a biological child. I so get that. But I think you need to 1. Give yourself a break. This journey has been so traumatic and so hard that I think you have hit your breaking point. And 2. Take some time to evaluate what it is you want out of being a parent. Because I also wonder if you have clung to this idea so hard because it mattered to you so much that you haven\u2019t had time to wrap your head around things. \n\nAnd lastly as a neurodivergent person to another. There are times I know I am not good at masking my emotions. Normally it comes when I am really stressed and upset. I think that because this is such a difficult time of your life that likely you haven\u2019t been as subtle about your upset at others being pregnant when you weren\u2019t or having children when you couldn\u2019t. No shame. I just think you have a lot going on and need some relief. Look into counseling. And also do some couples counseling. I think doing individual and couples therapy will allow you and your partner to really be able to process together what infertility has meant for your lives. And maybe for a couple of sessions you invite your sister to come so you can work out whatever is going on between you. \n\nIt\u2019s ok to be upset. It\u2019s not ok to lash out and take it out on someone. I think maybe you both where doing that a little. Your sister by just having a \u201cdeal with it attitude\u201d and you by seeing her as your next resort."]}
