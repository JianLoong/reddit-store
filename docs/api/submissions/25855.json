She has a difficult relationship with them. She felt bullied by her sister \"Cora\" (31F) growing up. Her mother was frequently ill and depressed and her father traveled for work for months at a time. They were kinda poor, so Cora did multiple jobs since her teens and was controlling and domineering with her siblings about chores and school work. My gf has a lot of resentment about her unpleasant childhood and has pushed back by sabotaging things for Cora in silly and petty ways. \n\nCora got married to her boyfriend of 3 years about 6 months ago. My gf flew over to attend but did act bratty to mess with Cora. It was mostly minor stuff like not confirming travel plans till last minute so Cora was forced to pay more for plane tickets, changing her mind about her dress frequently so Cora had to buy and return outfits multiple times. There were a few other things too like messing with some organized plans and refusing to do things she committed to. I don't really like it or understand it but she feels its important for such payback to bring a balance to her relationship with her sister.\n\nWhere I feel she went too far is that the night before the wedding, she had a long talk with the groom about how difficult and short tempered Cora can be. He has a kid (6M) from his previous marriage and she knew they were planning on having more kids right after they got married. She told him that Cora hates little children and will bully them. The newly weds ended up having a lot of fights over their honeymoon because the groom wanted to postpone having kids and change how much involvement Cora would have with her stepkid.\n\nCora found out recently that the conflicts are because her sister had this talk with her husband and she's been blowing up at my gf. She feels upset at my gf's interference because she wanted to have kids soon and my gf feels justified because she's convinced Cora would be an awful mother. I told her that it wasn't right for her to meddle in her sister's marriage just to mess with her, but she feels that nothing she said is untrue so she was morally right to do so. We have been having arguments about this and my gf is now mad at me.", "created_utc": 1693402854, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165f2nn/aita_for_telling_my_28m_gf_25f_that_she_went_too/", "score": 385, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So by being forced to parent her siblings as a teen, and being tough about home work and chores, GF feels justified in sabotaging her sister.  It sounds more ungrateful then anything.\n\nYour GF needs serious anger management and general therapy.  None of this is healthy or acceptable.  She says she just spoke the truth to her new BIL, but when you go in with an agenda there is a lot left out.  Your GF will not change unless she gets therapy and she does not seem to think she has a problem so, its likely she won't seek the help and you need to think about yourself with this woman.  Good Luck.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend is not a good person. I'm surprised the groom even took her remarks seriously, because someone who would behave that way and say those things at a sibling's wedding is clearly unhinged.\n\nQuit making excuses for this woman. You say you haven't even known her a year so your investment here is still relatively low.", "NTA\n\nYour gf needs to grow up and be thankful for cora, if bullying is being told to do chores, then your gf needs to do some researched. Also, behaving like a child at that big age is a big red flag...", "NTA - I'd be afraid of what your girlfriend is planning for you, she deliberately tried to wreck her sisters life at her wedding no less.\n\nThat type of behaviour is not something I would tie myself to.", "NTA Dude, you need to run. These kinds of games at that age are such a red flag. What happens when she feels morally justified to get back at you? She feels slighted by your own mother or other close family? Any future children you might want? This is cruelty and pettiness on a narcissistic level, and she needs help. Professional help. I was raised by a pretty abusive family as well. That's no excuse. It doesn't make her even, its just being toxic because that's all she knows, and using \"justice\" as her excuse.", "NTA. \n\nBeing forced to parent your siblings as a teenager is very different than choosing to become a mother! \n\nAs for redressing the balance in their relationship\u2026she\u2019s 25 years old!

And she should cut off her evil sister.", "NTA, your GF wasn't engaging in harmless pranks (saran wrap on the toilet or whatever) that would be momentarily annoying, she was trying to sabotage her sister's wedding. That isn't petty, it's vengeful and vindictive, and very clearly shows how she handles any conflict - not by talking about it or addressing it directly, but using hurt feelings to justify hurting others. That's not healthy in any relationship.", "NTA, your girlfriend has issues that should be looked into, they may come back to messing up your relationship with her. She is revengeful, so watch out.", "NTA. If anything use this as a sign and get out while you can because if your gf doesn't get the help she needs, you could see these things come up in your relationship.", "NTA but your GF is, and much more. Cora was put in a horrible situation by their shared parents when she was a CHILD. As an adult, your GF should be able to look back at the situation with more clarity than when she was young.

What will she do when you have a disagreement and she feels justified to start doing shit like that to you?", "NTA but your gf definitely is.

Imagine a future with someone like that. What do you think she'll do to you if you upset her? Or any future kids of your own? Or even your friends?

Cora is the VICTIM here, and your GF is the low-level abuser, now that she's an adult.  I hope Cora learned her lesson and cuts her off entirely, I feel terrible for her.  Honestly I'd dump the GF unless she agrees to therapy, because she's got a serious personality problem.", "NTA but YTA to yourself by staying with someone so petty and just plain not a good person. She is letting her resentments of her childhood rule her life and acting like a bratty child while doing it. It sounds like her sister was put in the parental role too early in life and got \"bossy\" with it. That's it. I would stay far away from this woman until she can get a handle on herself.

This is not an appropriate way to address childhood trauma/family dysfunction. Your gf needs serious therapy", "NTA.  It sounds like your gf grew up in a toxic environment, which then turned her into a toxic person.  I suggest some therapy for your girlfriend.

My cousin ended up being a seconday parent to his other 7 siblings.

He is now a father of four and is a loving and happy father. He had trouble with his siblings when they were younger but it's because he was a kid being asked to act as a parent. While I know that damaged his relationship with his siblings it wasn't his fault or their fault; it was the parent's fault. My aunt and uncle were threatening divorce not much than a year after their marriage and their kids suffered for it.

Your gf has a completely warped sense of morality, cannot deal with anger in a healthy way, and engages in behaviors that can only be described as evil and malicious. That she is unbothered by it compounds the awfulness she puts on display. \n\nYou should not marry somebody who cannot deal with anger and resentment in a healthy way. Your gf urgently needs therapy (so she can work through the above process and become a better person) and if she is unwilling to see that what she is doing is wrong, you need to break up.

And your girlfriend has not. She has not been able to move out of her childhood or see other people's points of view. \n\nThird, the parents. They failed all of their kids when they were young. And I get the impression they needed Cora to be the parent, but when they got complaints they didn't want to deal with they then blamed Cora.
