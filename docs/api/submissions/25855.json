{"id": 25855, "submission_id": "165f2nn", "title": "AITA for telling my (28M) gf (25F) that she went too far in messing with her sister?", "selftext": "My gf is low contact with her parents and older sister. She has a difficult relationship with them. She felt bullied by her sister \"Cora\" (31F) growing up. Her mother was frequently ill and depressed and her father traveled for work for months at a time. They were kinda poor, so Cora did multiple jobs since her teens and was controlling and domineering with her siblings about chores and school work. My gf has a lot of resentment about her unpleasant childhood and has pushed back by sabotaging things for Cora in silly and petty ways.\n\nCora got married to her boyfriend of 3 years about 6 months ago. My gf flew over to attend but did act bratty to mess with Cora. It was mostly minor stuff like not confirming travel plans till last minute so Cora was forced to pay more for plane tickets, changing her mind about her dress frequently so Cora had to buy and return outfits multiple times. There were a few other things too like messing with some organized plans and refusing to do things she committed to. I don't really like it or understand it but she feels its important for such payback to bring a balance to her relationship with her sister.\n\nWhere I feel she went too far is that the night before the wedding, she had a long talk with the groom about how difficult and short tempered Cora can be. He has a kid (6M) from his previous marriage and she knew they were planning on having more kids right after they got married. She told him that Cora hates little children and will bully them. The newly weds ended up having a lot of fights over their honeymoon because the groom wanted to postpone having kids and change how much involvement Cora would have with her stepkid.\n\nCora found out recently that the conflicts are because her sister had this talk with her husband and she's been blowing up at my gf. She feels upset at my gf's interference because she wanted to have kids soon and my gf feels justified because she's convinced Cora would be an awful mother. I told her that it wasn't right for her to meddle in her sister's marriage just to mess with her, but she feels that nothing she said is untrue so she was morally right to do so. We have been having arguments about this and my gf is now mad at me.\n\nETA: I've been asked this multiple times, so Cora is the oldest, their parents had separated after she was born then got back together a few years later and had 3 more kids one after another. My gf is the 2nd oldest. The youngest two are close to both my gf and Cora and ignore the conflict between the two. Cora did different short term jobs for extra money before she got her full time job. She didn't do 2+ jobs at the same time.

In your post you say GF is mad because growing up, their mother was ill and depressed and the father was not around due to work, leaving them in a poor condition requiring Cora as a teen to have to work multiple jobs  helping with the home and got on your GF about chores and school work.  So by being forced to parent her siblings as a teen, and being tough about home work and chores, GF feels justified in sabotaging her sister.  It sounds more ungrateful then anything.\n\nYour GF needs serious anger management and general therapy.  None of this is healthy or acceptable.  She says she just spoke the truth to her new BIL, but when you go in with an agenda there is a lot left out.

Good Luck.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend is not a good person. I'm surprised the groom even took her remarks seriously, because someone who would behave that way and say those things at a sibling's wedding is clearly unhinged.\n\nQuit making excuses for this woman. You say you haven't even known her a year so your investment here is still relatively low.", "NTA\n\nYour gf needs to grow up and be thankful for cora, if bullying is being told to do chores, then your gf needs to do some researched. Also, behaving like a child at that big age is a big red flag...", "NTA - I'd be afraid of what your girlfriend is planning for you, she deliberately tried to wreck her sisters life at her wedding no less.\n\nThat type of behaviour is not something I would tie myself to.", "NTA Dude, you need to run. These kinds of games at that age are such a red flag. What happens when she feels morally justified to get back at you? She feels slighted by your own mother or other close family? Any future children you might want? This is cruelty and pettiness on a narcissistic level, and she needs help. Professional help. I was raised by a pretty abusive family as well. That's no excuse. It doesn't make her even, its just being toxic because that's all she knows, and using \"justice\" as her excuse.", "NTA. \n\nBeing forced to parent your siblings as a teenager is very different than choosing to become a mother! \n\nAs for redressing the balance in their relationship\u2026she\u2019s 25 years old!

And she should cut off her evil sister.", "NTA, your GF wasn't engaging in harmless pranks (saran wrap on the toilet or whatever) that would be momentarily annoying, she was trying to sabotage her sister's wedding. That isn't petty, it's vengeful and vindictive, and very clearly shows how she handles any conflict - not by talking about it or addressing it directly, but using hurt feelings to justify hurting others. That's not healthy in any relationship.", "NTA, your girlfriend has issues that should be looked into, they may come back to messing up your relationship with her. She is revengeful, so watch out.", "NTA. If anything use this as a sign and get out while you can because if your gf doesn't get the help she needs, you could see these things come up in your relationship.", "NTA but your GF is, and much more. Cora was put in a horrible situation by their shared parents when she was a CHILD. As an adult, your GF should be able to look back at the situation with more clarity than when she was young.

None of what she did feels minor to me. She needs serious help. Yikes. NTA. Your gf is a giant gaping asshole.", "NTA. What will she do when you have a disagreement and she feels justified to start doing shit like that to you?", "NTA but your gf definitely is. I'm sure Cora didn't want to be parentified from a young age, either.", "NTA, but your girlfriend is a sociopath in training", "Bro leave her. She doesn't sound mentally stable. Imagine a future with someone like that. What do you think she'll do to you if you upset her? Or any future kids of your own? Or even your friends?

Cora is the VICTIM here, and your GF is the low-level abuser, now that she's an adult.  I hope Cora learned her lesson and cuts her off entirely, I feel terrible for her.  Honestly I'd dump the GF unless she agrees to therapy, because she's got a serious personality problem.", "NTA but YTA to yourself by staying with someone so petty and just plain not a good person. She is letting her resentments of her childhood rule her life and acting like a bratty child while doing it. It sounds like her sister was put in the parental role too early in life and got \"bossy\" with it. That's it. I would stay far away from this woman until she can get a handle on herself.

Yikes. If you break up or argue with her, be prepared for her to be just as vindictive and petty with you.", "NTA but your girlfriend sure is!! This is not an appropriate way to address childhood trauma/family dysfunction. Your gf needs serious therapy", "NTA.  It sounds like your gf grew up in a toxic environment, which then turned her into a toxic person.  I suggest some therapy for your girlfriend.

He is now a father of four and is a loving and happy father. He had trouble with his siblings when they were younger but it's because he was a kid being asked to act as a parent. While I know that damaged his relationship with his siblings it wasn't his fault or their fault; it was the parent's fault.

What is legitimately scary is that she believes she is morally justified in all this. It means she has a completely warped moral compass. Abuse does not justify abuse. It simply doesn't. Your gut is correct, this isn't right.\n\nHow an adult deals with trauma (if your gf is truly traumatized): reflection, therapy, compassion for the self and any others who have been hurt by what happened, if desired confrontation (tell the person that their abusive behavior has been traumatizing to you and wishing that they apologize and try to make things right), and in the best case reconciliation, in other cases low or no contact to protect yourself against more hurt. It seems your gf has taken few to none of those steps. \n\nHaving trauma doesn't mean you are right about things. Trauma often results in harmful coping mechanisms. Taking revenge is not healthy. Going to Cora's husband is merely the latest of the messed-up things she has done. Seriously, all the other things she did are very bad already. Also, 'warning' the husband based on their childhood presumes that Cora has learned nothing despite being a 30-yo adult who is doing well in many respects. That's a malicious assumption on the part of your gf.\n\nThat's why people are warning you here on Reddit. Your gf has a completely warped sense of morality, cannot deal with anger in a healthy way, and engages in behaviors that can only be described as evil and malicious. That she is unbothered by it compounds the awfulness she puts on display. \n\nYou should not marry somebody who cannot deal with anger and resentment in a healthy way. Your gf urgently needs therapy (so she can work through the above process and become a better person) and if she is unwilling to see that what she is doing is wrong, you need to break up. What do you think her manipulative behavior is going to do to your future marriage and/or children? Do you believe her anger will never turn towards you or any kids that may come? Do you believe your angry gf would never do the things she is now proudly doing to her sister? If so, you are dangerously naive.", "Cora was parentified as a child herself. Working multiple jobs. Caring for multiple siblings. Your gf sounds immature and ungrateful. Sure Cora may have been tough back then but she was a stressed child herself, trying to keep the family running on her own.

I feel so bad for Cora. \n\nSecond, I don't know if your girlfriend doesn't have empathy, has a terrible therapist who didn't help her see the whole picture, or if she is just a vindictive person. Cora seems to put up with all of the small things your girlfriend does and handles it much better than I would (I would have just told her to pay for herself at some point) and she seems to have matured and grown. And your girlfriend has not. She has not been able to move out of her childhood or see other people's points of view. \n\nThird, the parents. They failed all of their kids when they were young. And I get the impression they needed Cora to be the parent, but when they got complaints they didn't want to deal with they then blamed Cora.

Was Cora supposed to do her sister's chores for her, on top of financially supporting her? Would your gf have been better off if Cora had let her go hungry, live in filth, etc?

If she really doesn\u2019t want to have a relationship with Cora fine, but grow up and stay out of her life then. These aren\u2019t \u201cpranks\u201d or jokes. It\u2019s straight her trying to sabotage Cora\u2019s life after she literally gave up her childhood to raise your sister. Seriously disgusting.", "The fact that the groom took her seriously at all makes me think that Cora has said nothing but nice things about her sister to her fiance. \n\n\nNTA, OP. I hope you can see that your sister is not a good person. Your arguments are not going to work, so consider your options going forward.", "I also feel like gf is an unreliable narrator here (unless Cora has confirmed it).  She's an ungrateful brat who actively tries to destroy her parentified sister's adult life after her childhood was ruined. I would not be at all surprised to find out things weren't at all like she has told OP.", "Better than waiting until they\u2019re married/have kids and THEN he finds out how she acts when she doesn\u2019t get her way.\n\nOP, think about it this way- most parents are at least somewhat strict with their kids about chores and schoolwork. Your GF didn\u2019t go through anything extreme. She\u2019s STILL holding onto childhood resentments at the age of 25 and STILL can\u2019t see that her sister\u2019s life was much harder than hers was. \n\nShe\u2019s selfish and vindictive. Based on everything here, you GF is the one who likely won\u2019t be a very good mother and all the things you\u2019ve listed her doing to her sister are truly cruel. \n\nPoor Cora. She deserved better as a kid and she still deserves better now. \n\nYou\u2019re NTA, but for your own sake, listen to everyone above and RUN.", "The fact that Cora had to grow up early by getting multiple jobs and parenting her siblings is sad. Gf does not appreciate the sacrifices she had to make at a young age. She wasn\u2019t \u201cmessing\u201d with her. She was sabotaging her life. OP, I\u2019d run away from her as fast as you can", "I really have not heard anything that terrible that Cora supposedly did. Yes the yelling and the grounding is extreme, but Cora was a child too! She didn\u2019t know how to deal with parenting because obviously the parents weren\u2019t stellar. She didn\u2019t beat them, torture them, or deprive them of basic things like food and shelter. She grounded them and took electronics.  Your gf sounds unhinged.", "That\u2019s what happens when a child is forced to parent her siblings. She was a CHILD. Your gf by contrast is a grown woman acting very spitefully and maliciously.", "Exactly and at no point does OP say Cora blew up on GF during all these games she played pre wedding so it sounds like she already has the patience and tolerance to be a parent.", "And cost money...perhaps LOTS of money. That is not minor either.", "this 100%. I think this is really what it is. Cora was the punching bag for her little sister's bitterness about her situation growing up, and never really had to challenge that thinking as she got older. Cora continues to be the parent to her little sister, who continues to act out for her big sister's attention, hoping one day she'll hear cora apologize for her childhood so she can throw the apology back in her face. I doubt she wants to go NC entirely, and if she ever does, she'll find another punching bag. probably you."]}
