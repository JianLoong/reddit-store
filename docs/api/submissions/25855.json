She has a difficult relationship with them. She felt bullied by her sister \"Cora\" (31F) growing up. Her mother was frequently ill and depressed and her father traveled for work for months at a time. They were kinda poor, so Cora did multiple jobs since her teens and was controlling and domineering with her siblings about chores and school work. My gf has a lot of resentment about her unpleasant childhood and has pushed back by sabotaging things for Cora in silly and petty ways. \n\nCora got married to her boyfriend of 3 years about 6 months ago. My gf flew over to attend but did act bratty to mess with Cora. It was mostly minor stuff like not confirming travel plans till last minute so Cora was forced to pay more for plane tickets, changing her mind about her dress frequently so Cora had to buy and return outfits multiple times. There were a few other things too like messing with some organized plans and refusing to do things she committed to. I don't really like it or understand it but she feels its important for such payback to bring a balance to her relationship with her sister.\n\nWhere I feel she went too far is that the night before the wedding, she had a long talk with the groom about how difficult and short tempered Cora can be. He has a kid (6M) from his previous marriage and she knew they were planning on having more kids right after they got married. She told him that Cora hates little children and will bully them. The newly weds ended up having a lot of fights over their honeymoon because the groom wanted to postpone having kids and change how much involvement Cora would have with her stepkid.\n\nCora found out recently that the conflicts are because her sister had this talk with her husband and she's been blowing up at my gf. She feels upset at my gf's interference because she wanted to have kids soon and my gf feels justified because she's convinced Cora would be an awful mother. I told her that it wasn't right for her to meddle in her sister's marriage just to mess with her, but she feels that nothing she said is untrue so she was morally right to do so. We have been having arguments about this and my gf is now mad at me.", "created_utc": 1693402854, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/165f2nn/aita_for_telling_my_28m_gf_25f_that_she_went_too/", "score": 93, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So by being forced to parent her siblings as a teen, and being tough about home work and chores, GF feels justified in sabotaging her sister.  It sounds more ungrateful then anything.\n\nYour GF needs serious anger management and general therapy.  None of this is healthy or acceptable.  She says she just spoke the truth to her new BIL, but when you go in with an agenda there is a lot left out.  Your GF will not change unless she gets therapy and she does not seem to think she has a problem so, its likely she won't seek the help and you need to think about yourself with this woman.  Good Luck.", "NTA.  Your girlfriend is not a good person. I'm surprised the groom even took her remarks seriously, because someone who would behave that way and say those things at a sibling's wedding is clearly unhinged.\n\nQuit making excuses for this woman. You say you haven't even known her a year so your investment here is still relatively low.", "NTA\n\nYour gf needs to grow up and be thankful for cora, if bullying is being told to do chores, then your gf needs to do some researched. Also, behaving like a child at that big age is a big red flag...", "NTA - I'd be afraid of what your girlfriend is planning for you, she deliberately tried to wreck her sisters life at her wedding no less.\n\nThat type of behaviour is not something I would tie myself to.", "NTA Dude, you need to run. These kinds of games at that age are such a red flag. What happens when she feels morally justified to get back at you? She feels slighted by your own mother or other close family? Any future children you might want? This is cruelty and pettiness on a narcissistic level, and she needs help. Professional help. I was raised by a pretty abusive family as well. That's no excuse. It doesn't make her even, its just being toxic because that's all she knows, and using \"justice\" as her excuse.", "NTA. \n\nBeing forced to parent your siblings as a teenager is very different than choosing to become a mother! \n\nAs for redressing the balance in their relationship\u2026she\u2019s 25 years old!

And she should cut off her evil sister.", "NTA, your GF wasn't engaging in harmless pranks (saran wrap on the toilet or whatever) that would be momentarily annoying, she was trying to sabotage her sister's wedding. That isn't petty, it's vengeful and vindictive, and very clearly shows how she handles any conflict - not by talking about it or addressing it directly, but using hurt feelings to justify hurting others. That's not healthy in any relationship.", "NTA, your girlfriend has issues that should be looked into, they may come back to messing up your relationship with her. She is revengeful, so watch out.", "NTA. If anything use this as a sign and get out while you can because if your gf doesn't get the help she needs, you could see these things come up in your relationship.", "NTA but your GF is, and much more. Cora was put in a horrible situation by their shared parents when she was a CHILD. As an adult, your GF should be able to look back at the situation with more clarity than when she was young.

Imagine a future with someone like that. What do you think she'll do to you if you upset her? Or any future kids of your own? Or even your friends?

Cora is the VICTIM here, and your GF is the low-level abuser, now that she's an adult.  I hope Cora learned her lesson and cuts her off entirely, I feel terrible for her.  Honestly I'd dump the GF unless she agrees to therapy, because she's got a serious personality problem.", "NTA but YTA to yourself by staying with someone so petty and just plain not a good person. She is letting her resentments of her childhood rule her life and acting like a bratty child while doing it. It sounds like her sister was put in the parental role too early in life and got \"bossy\" with it. That's it. I would stay far away from this woman until she can get a handle on herself.

This is not an appropriate way to address childhood trauma/family dysfunction. Your gf needs serious therapy", "NTA.  It sounds like your gf grew up in a toxic environment, which then turned her into a toxic person.  I suggest some therapy for your girlfriend.

My cousin ended up being a seconday parent to his other 7 siblings.

He is now a father of four and is a loving and happy father. He had trouble with his siblings when they were younger but it's because he was a kid being asked to act as a parent. While I know that damaged his relationship with his siblings it wasn't his fault or their fault; it was the parent's fault. My aunt and uncle were threatening divorce not much than a year after their marriage and their kids suffered for it.

Poor Cora.", "I\u2019m just going to throw this in there that Cora was a fucking TEEN while all of that was going on. She did what she could the only way she knew how.", "Her sister probably also struggled very much. I don\u2019t like to compare suffering but she probably suffered significantly and your GF is being unfair to that. Regarding her childhood she should be upset at her parents not at her sister. Honestly this is a mess and if I were you I\u2019d reconsider my future with the GF and probably reach out to the groom and tell him that what GF said might be biased and misrepresenting what happened.", ">She grew up under the power of a sibling who was frequently angry and abrasive. She yelled at her siblings a lot and fought with their parents all the time.\n\nHave you or your gf ever considered that it could be caused by the immense stress that Cora felt, especially from being a victim of parentification? Imagine being a teen and having that many responsibilities.\n\n>My gf says she's been through therapy before and it has helped her a lot.\n\nNo, it really hasn't. To sabotage someone's marriage like that is just evil.", "Cora as a kid was being forced to work and take care of her siblings because her mom couldn't and her father was gone working. I would argue she's as much a victim of this situation as her sister is, maybe even more. She should have never been put in that situation and it's pretty understandable she didn't deal with it well and was angry. She probably carried a lot of resentment. No shit she fought a lot with her parents, who wouldn't in that situation.\n\nIf you can even remotely understand why your gf as an adult is acting this way towards Cora out of resentment, you should try having that same level of understanding for how Cora as a teenager could have behaved out of resentment.", "She was angry, because she was a teen forced to be the breadwinner and parent to an ungrateful sister.\n\nSeems like a ton of stress for Cora, and totally understandable she would have a lot of anger.\n\nNo, GF's therapy hasn't done shit for her, if she is still so resentful she'll pull these stunts, bud.", "Guess what? It wasn\u2019t Cora job to provide for her siblings, it wasn\u2019t her job to be their parent. It was their parents job, yet she was forced to do that.", "But you think Cora\u2019s childhood was wonderful??? Cora working multiple jobs, probably cooking and cleaning, and she had to do it with a smile on her face??", "Nope. We get it. Look up parentification. That\u2019s why happened to Cora. She was a child acting as a parent. Of course she was angry, she was angry. She lost her own childhood.", "Stress and anxiety,\nStomachaches or headaches,\nAggression,\nAcademic troubles,\nSocial difficulties, \nTrouble maintaining friendships,\nInability to enjoy age-appropriate activities,\nNeglect of their own needs and feelings,\nFeelings of self-blame and self-doubt,\nAnger and depression over the loss of childhood in teenagers and adults. These are just some of the symptoms of being parentified,which is what Cora was. Your GF is in the wrong. There are plenty of people on both sides that see a clear picture,people are just not on your GFs. Cora had her childhood and teen years stripped from her,to run a household that wasn't hers and raise children that weren't her responsibility. It's actually surprising that Cora wants children of her own.", "Everyone understood. It\u2019s not some unique story to be raised by a sibling. And you are shocked that a child being forced to parent her siblings didn\u2019t make the best choices? GTFO. GF is ungrateful and doesn\u2019t understand the hardship threat her sister had to go through. Did her sister even get to have a childhood? Your GF is self centered and refusing to get past how she views she was a victim instead of seeing that her sister was a victim, and while maybe didn\u2019t make the best choices did the best she could as an adolescent with raging hormones being forced to raise siblings.", "You need to take a good look at her stories and maybe talk to the sister because the abuse in your gf childhood did not come from sister. Her poor childhood is not because of her sister, instead, it seems like sister had to give up her own childhood to work and finance AND parent her siblings. Your gf is a mayor AH.", "Your gf's bad childhood was due to neglectful parents. Her anger is misdirected. She should be resentful of her parents, not lashing out at her sister who gave up her childhood to step-up and raise her siblings because her parents weren't doing it.\n\nCora was abused: [PARENTIFICATION](https://www.healthline.com/health/parentification#definition)", "Sounds like it's all fun and games whilst she's getting what she wants but if she takes against you she will try to destroy anything you care about.\n\nBetter hope you don't upset her.", "She's a despicable human being. Her sister is the one that was abused.", "Cora seemed to accommodate your gf through all her \u201ctricks\u201d pre wedding. She wanted her sister there, your gf didn\u2019t want to be there to support, just to sabotage.", "But Cora was also abused. Your GF will make a terrible mother if she hold grudges like this.  Kids are assholes that say shitty things at times. She need better therapy. Stop enabling her behavior you are just as bad.", "Yeah, I am sure she'll turn her anger towards you if you stick around long enough.", ">she is generally smart and sweet.   \n>  \n>She is nice in other areas of her life\n\nReally? When? Was it when she was \"not confirming travel plans till last minute **so Cora was forced to pay more for plane tickets**, changing her mind about her dress frequently **so Cora had to buy and return outfits multiple times**. There were a few other things too like **messing with some organized plans and refusing to do things she committed to**.\"\n\nYeah, Cora must be so awful to pay for your GF's dress and flights. A real jerk. \n\nI am honestly amazed that Cora hasn't cut your GF out of her life already. \n\nNTA for calling out your GF, but major Y T A for making excuses for her cruel and bratty behaviour.", "So...... she acted like a parent. \n\nBecause...... the actual parents were neglecting the kids..\n\nAnd you can't see this because....????? \n\nYour gf is cruel. Without her sister acting as a parent, she would have been in a VERY different life. Possibly dead in the worst case, possibly taken by protection services and put onto foster care. Yet, because your gf was taken care of by her older sister, and there was a \"power imbalance\" she's crul to her and basically warned her groom that she's abusive? \n\nWooooooowwwwwww", "Because Cora was parenting smh. Open your eyes and set your gf straight. Both of you have a lot of growing to do.", "Because Cora, a child was doing their parents\u2019 job for them, parenting her siblings. Groundings, removal of electronics, making sure home work got done, chores were done - all the stuff that your parents probably did for you?\n\nIf Cora hadn\u2019t done any of this and girlf hadn\u2019t got school certificates, didn\u2019t eat, etc she\u2019d be blaming Cora for that as well. \n\nCora was in a damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t situation. Your girlf needs to grow up - and you need to see that. All us internet strangers can, perhaps you need to try as well.", "Cora was basically her siblings mom and dad how else do you think she should have parented? Just let them get away with whatever. Your gf should be thankful to Cora for stepping up not trying to ruin her life.", "Because it wasn't a normal sibling relationship. She was the de factor parent. Grounding and taking away electronics is part of the job which she shouldn't have been forced to do in the first place. There is no defense for your GF's behavior.", "Dude you need to Google what parentification is and stop making excuses for your gfs terrible behaviour.", "Your gf is an AH.", "Your girlfriend is definitely trying to wreck her sister's life. The \"moral obligation\" exuse is complete bs. She admires her sister, so tries to ruin her wedding and relationship? She only wants to be in her sister's life so she can ruin it. Your girlfriend needs therapy, and her sister needs to cut your gf's vindictive ass out of her life.", "What your girlfriend is doing is not needling. She is trying to destroy her sister's life. Your girlfriend is a major AH and you will be too if you continue to put up with that shit.", "Homie, I think you got blinders on right now. You know her personally, and I don't. The picture you have painted is not a good person. It is a vengeful person who will stoop to whatever lengths when she feels justified. Even with your attempts at rehabbing her image in the comments, she still comes across as a major risk. \n\nI'd proceed with extreme caution if you're gonna stick around.", ">She said the BIL comes across as a very sweet guy and she felt obliged to warn him of what he'll be facing.\n\nYou are surely joking.", "She is absolutely trying to destroy her sister\u2019s marriage and that would most likely wreck her sister\u2019s life. The sister\u2019s husband now wants to put off having children because of what your girlfriend did. She also ruined her sister\u2019s honeymoon. She cost her sister time and money for shits and giggles. \n\nYour girlfriend sucks. If my sister pulled some shit like that, I\u2019d stop speaking to her. Your girlfriend needs therapy and to talk things out with her sister, but it sounds like she\u2019s more interested in revenge. What happens when your girlfriend feels like you\u2019ve wronged her? What kinda shit will she pull on you? Your girlfriend has no moral high ground here.\n\nEdit - spelling", "Then your GF is a total AH. What a childish and petty way to deal with your issues. Issues that are actually not even Cora's fault. Your GF sounds awful.", "Yeah, your gf is emotionally manipulative and is being abusive towards her sister.", "Oh come on you cannot be this naive. After messing with her sister via travelling and dresses you cannot fathom that what she said to BIL was done out of anything other than altruistic concern? If it was the only thing she did there'd be plausible deniability but with all the rest of it NO WAY.", "Whatever she claims, she did not do this out if concern for the BIL. She did not \u201cfeel obliged to warn him\u201d, she felt a desire to sabotage her sister.", "She's lying. She has no idea of how her sister would be as an adult in this situation. Why are you defending her? You came here to post about her horrid behavior, but don't want feedback", "You're seeing your GF through rose colored glasses, she has some major issues that she needs to deal with.  \n\nShe purposely sabotaged the most important day of her sister's life, the sister who sacrificed her entire childhood to raise and support her, her siblings and her parents.  Not just the night before the wedding when she spoke to the groom but all the stress leading up to the wedding - every stunt she pulled added to her sister's stress on what should have been a special day.  \n\nThe only wedding memories her sister will remember about your GF are bad memories.  Every wedding picture will remind her of the bad along with the good, ever picture with your GF in it will make her sad, every time she sees the video will be bittersweet.  \n\n*I hope your GF is really proud of herself - she ruined not just the day but the memory of the day, I know because my sister did it to mine.*  30+ years later and I still have a little twinge of sad remaining, no anger anymore (although my husband still hates her for making me cry on my wedding day) but I don't think the little twinge of sad ever goes away.", "You\u2019re an enabler, what will you do when she feels morally right to act like that with you?", "You don't \"warn someone of what they'll be facing\" to needle them. That's something you do with someone you deeply hate and/or fear. Like, a high level method of dealing with a serious abuser. This is not silly or petty behavior.", "Why, so she can ruin it? I can see that your gf has a lot of resentment and issues after her childhood that need dealing with - but - it\u2019s all in the planning, isn\u2019t it. Becoming lc with her sister, not turning up to the wedding, not contacting her; that\u2019s sad but normal, Following her sister around to stick pins in her life and wriggle those pins until they\u2019re infected - that\u2019s vicious and weird. She should leave her sister in peace - she\u2019s done plenty of damage, probably wrecked her marriage so she\u2019s got that to feel great about to tide her over until someone else pisses her off. As for you, I\u2019d leave. Very carefully. And never, ever turn my back on her.", "When you have a problem with her, she's going to engage in petty pranks like slashing your your tires, throwing out anything that you care about, telling people you abuse her.\n\nThen for the rest of your relationship she will feel justified to pull pretty pranks like making you buy things multiple times and go back to the store all the time.\n\nThis woman is going to take any excuse to justify her doing s***** things to people.\n\nIf you are my sibling, I would heavily encourage you to leave this an hinged person making sure that as soon as you leave them, you immediately change all of the locks including in your car. I would also advise you to primitively try to get a order of protection because you know she is going to do stuff.", "They\u2019re probably terrified of replacing her sister as her fun project", "You mean, whilst Cora, a child was doing their parents\u2019 job for them, parenting her siblings. Groundings, removal of electronics, making sure home work got done, chores were done - all the stuff that your parents probably did for you? \n\nNTA for saying your girlf went too far, but def an AH for not understanding this in any of your replies.", "This is extremely childish and misplaced vindictive behavior. She needs more therapy and I hope her sister never speaks to her again,", "Well - the fiance ASKED her, so he must have had some concerns. Why else would he discuss this with her?", "Right?! \n\nI'm sure gf's childhood was awful, and Cora likely did not do an ideal job of \"parenting\" her siblings, but well.... see above re her being a *literal teenager* forced to keep a family afloat. \n\nBut none of that is Cora's fault, and it also likely does not reflect how she would be as an actual parent now that she's a stable adult (who hopefully has also gotten some therapy in the years since). \n\nGf is taking out her (justifiable!) anger on the wrong person.", "I wish Cora would make a post here so we could collectively tell her to go nc and cut the asshole out of her life for good", "No I agree its messed up, that's why I am here asking. I want to present her viewpoints so I can get proper feedback. I told her its disturbed me and she feels she is justified. I am sharing how she thinks so people can tell me if I am in the wrong to see this as problematic.", "Where does it says the fianc\u00e9 asked her? In the post OP said that the his gf talked to the groom and told him that her sister is short tempered etc.\nNowhere it said that the groom asked her, it probably was the gf who went and talked to the groom about it since she likes to mess with her sister, not the other way around.", "I\u2019d like to see a post from Cora as well. It sounds like they had a rough childhood, but Cora was a kid too and she was working multiple jobs and patenting her siblings. I can\u2019t imagine how rough that was and she probably made mistakes. But again, she was a child herself who was most likely doing the best she could at the time. \n\nOP\u2019s girlfriend should be angry at her parents. She should\u2019ve sit down and talked things out with Cora. Instead she\u2019s doing shitty things for revenge while trying to claim the moral high ground.", "Her actions are bad enough even of she admitted she's simply lashing out due to childhood pain, but her trying to sell it as looking out for BIL is highly manipulative and would be another huge red flag if I were you."]}
