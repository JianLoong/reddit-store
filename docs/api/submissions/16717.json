It is completely reasonable if the only partner doing any parenting puts their foot down on an unacceptable behavior partner.\n\nEDIT: Because I\u2019m feeling salty on OP\u2019s behalf\n\nGod the sexism is strong here.\n\nWhy does dad always get to be the Funtime guy and mum always has to be the downer doing the actual parenting? \n\nThis is a huge problem in society. You\u2019re sitting here perpetuating a sexist system as if it\u2019s good for children.\n\nYou know what is really good for children having a father who is an active partner in parenting. \n\nIt\u2019s also completely false that children won\u2019t recognize as the grow that dad didn\u2019t give enough of a shot about them to actually be present in their lives. \n\nWhen they look back as adults it\u2019s going to be mum they respect.

Horseplay and roughhousing are very important for your children's development. If Dad wants to take over and play hee-haw he can very well do that - that's great! But, what he can't do is take over, create a mess and then have the nanny come put out the fire. If Nanny is going to taking care of business we play by her rules. If Dad is going to be taking care of business then we can play by his.", "NTA. Ignore the aggrieved men in the comments. If your husband wants to help with bedtime, then he needs to actually *help* with bedtime, not make it harder than it needs to be.

He's gone all the time for work. You and nanny are the primary \"parents\" in this situation. Maybe it's not the ideal situation, but that is the situation because of his job. He needs to come to terms with that instead of trying to assert his authority over her as the \"dad.\" Or he can change jobs to something that allows him to play a more active and present role in his kids' lives.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.  He's trying to Disney Dad his way out of his guilt over being a Mainly-Absent parent.  He needs to actually take responsibility for putting the kids to bed if he wants to disrupt the schedule.\n\nHe's being very disingenuous by whining about being \"replaced\" by the nanny, but also refusing to let her go home because he doesn't want to handle his own children alone.", "NTA. As their dad, it is his job to make sure they are healthy and happy, and sticking to their routine is the best way of doing that. (Aside from special occasions, of course.) Either he needs the nanny there or he doesn't, but he can't insist she stay and then make her job worse. I'm sure at his high profile job he would immediately sack someone who interfered with his ability to competently perform his duties.

If your husband consistently disrespects that, you will probably lose yours. So NTA if you stick up for her.", ">He told me I\u2019m allowing the nanny to take over and replace him.\n\nWelp. That's how it goes when you're never home. He doesn't even want to parent. He takes the kids for an hour at a time and gives them junk. Then he hands them back to you or your nanny. NTA.", "NTA. The nanny is the expert on these kids' bath-and-bedtime. She's been doing it, she knows what's going on. If he can't defer to her as the expert, he's undermining her to the kids and making her job harder. And if he wants to replace the nanny, he can handle it alone and deal with all that entails.", "NTA. Routine is important and if he's coming in and messing up the rhythm you guys have worked out, it's going to create issues. It sounds like your husband wants it both ways and that doesn't work as it is bound to confuse the kids and make problems.", "NTA but bigger issues. Probably an unpopular opinion. He's allowing the nanny to replace him via his regular absence. But his time with family should be encouraged as well. Rock and a hard place.", "~~N A H~~, I see both sides. If you guys aren't able to communicate effectively to focus on the needs of the children, instead of being hurt over each other's perfectly valid feelings, then you need a marriage counsellor to help you do that.\n\nEdit to provide additional context: \n\nOP:  \n>I\u2019ve wanted him to help more for awhile now. But his version of help is taking the kids for an hour, getting them sugared out. Which is fine sometimes but not all the time. He doesn\u2019t follow their routines at all, won\u2019t enforce rules. I\u2019m basically doing it all and am bad cop. (This is on weekends)\n\nMy response:  \n>The context that he's not their parent, but a buddy that shows up once every 3 months to horse play with them, puts this story firmly into NTA territory. I think marriage counseling should be on the table as an ultimatum.", "NTA. Its literally her job to keep the kids on a routine if his interfering is getting in the way of that then he is actually just wasting money hiring her. however, he is still their dad and probably wants to feel involved, maybe instead of framing it as the nanny is in charge frame it more like the nanny is more used to their routine/schedule and he has to learn/adjust to it and should follow her example for that.", "NTA, its like having a semi grown up fourth child who just comes home at times, does a bit of mad child minding and leave for the others to deal with the outcome. It isn't good for the kids and if he wants to spoil them, then either he needs to do it on his terms minus the nanny and take responsibility of putting them to bed and so on or just let nanny do her job. What he is doing is interrupting the mechanic while he's fixing the car by telling him how he should do it and then complaining that since he is paying for the mechanic he should abide by what he tells him. If you hire a professional, follow the lead as he/ she know what's best or else the nanny will always find someone else to pay her and it might be your family who will take time to find another nanny before things goes to normal. Stand your ground on this one.", " NTA because you are trying to make sure the nanny can do her job efficiently so she can presumably then go to her own home on time.", "NTA. Coming from a man with no kids, your husband has chosen to work where works and that means he has chosen to be involved with his kids as he is.\n\nIf you have to pay someone to make up for him not being there and being apart of their growth/development, he should shut up and not hinder their growth/development.\n\n(That's not even going into the gender role scenario their being exposed to.)", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I would say if your husband wants to be the go to guy on a given evening, he should give the nanny the (paid) night off and take care of them himself.", "NTA.  you aren't having the nanny replace him.  this actually has nothing to do with your nanny.  you're simply asking him to coparent with you.  since you're there more often, you know what works best.  i'm not sure why he's having trouble respecting that, and you.  this isn't about her, or even you or him, it's about what's best for your kids.  they're still so young, and routines are so important.  their bodies benefit from knowing \"what's next\", on so many levels.  and it makes it easier on anyone who's taking care of them.  \n\nthere's a time for playing with dad (or mom, or anyone else for that matter), and a time to stick to the routine.  if he wants to be involved in the nightly routine, that's wonderful.  but \\*he\\* needs to be a part of \\*it\\*, not the other way around.  if he can't handle them when she isn't there, then he really does need to follow her lead.  what else is he going to do?  take the kids lead?  so they can roughhouse to their hearts content, not get enough sleep and be a wreck at school the next day?  if he's home on the weekends, let that be their play time.  you can deviate from the routine on the weekends.  \n\nbeing gone often is not an excuse to not be firm with your own kids.  that's guilt parenting.  he isn't a toy or a plaything and he needs to get himself out of that mindset.  he's responsible for bringing up 3 human beings and if he wants them to be good, responsible people, he has to actively be a part of that when he's there.", "If he wants to be a parent, the least he could do is to learn about the kids\u2019 routines and which times are best for such types of games. \n\nWhat does he expect? That when he suddenly has time to be with the kids, then all rules don\u2019t apply and everyone has to just adapt to his schedule? \n\nNono, definitely NTA", "NTA. In this case, it's whatever is best for the kids. He can't provide the structured routine the kids need, as he is not there most of the time. The nanny can. He should let her do her job.", "NTA. Your husband is though, seeing the Nanny as just an employee? Whilst this technically is true, he might want to think about how he and you would feel if she quit and you had to replace her.", "NTA - sounds like you and your nanny have a good system worked out. Your husband should be worked into the routine and he can learn what to do and not do.", "NTA. Dad needs to spend time with the kids/nanny at night a few times so he can get the swing of things and can be a helpful component when it comes to that routine. \n\nNow, it sound like he is missing his kids and wants to play with them (which must be hard working at all the times when you would be able to), so maybe try and find a way to schedule it in so he can be around when it's chaos time? I also would make sure to really re-assure him that there is no way that he could ever be replaced, and that his sacrifice to work so much to support the family doesn't go unnoticed. Heck, maybe you guys can work in a \"dad's home!\" part of the routine where he gets to do something all alone with the kids and have his dedicated father time - a special bedtime book, a non-stimulating game/show, etc.", "NTA, but why don't you swap when dad is home so the baby is put to bed by the nanny and the boys spend time with you and dad? Nanny can peace out while he parents.", "I think ESH, except your nanny. \n\nYou and your husband need to have a conversation about these things and come to an agreement and/or compromise together. I agree that your husband should respect the routine, but saying he has to defer to her or he\u2019s cut out isn\u2019t the right move imo. \n\nThey\u2019re both of your kids - as much as the nanny may feel like your third parent, she\u2019s not. Figure out how you two want to parent them and how your husband can still be involved in their lives, when he can, on the daily.\n\nAnd OP - if you guys can\u2019t have a productive conversation about these kind of things then you really need to work on your relationship.", "NTA he's causing unnecessary problems for everyone involved", "Consistency is hugely important for young children.  If the nanny has worked out a good system, both parents should go along with it.\n\nNAH", "I think NTA but _very slightly_ E-S-H.\n\nI only say the latter because I think you should be the one to school him on the routine. It\u2019s not the Nanny\u2019s responsibility to teach him how to care for his children, the same way he wouldn\u2019t teach her how to do his job.\n\nAt the same time they\u2019re his children and I imagine he looks forward to spending time with them when he can, which is obviously a great thing. If he really wants to be a responsible father figure though he needs to put the work in.. ALL the work. Not just show up and have fun, he need to know how to care for his children in all situations. If he doesn\u2019t want to learn then he totally needs to take a backseat and accept his role for what it is. \n\nI have 3 kids myself and understand how important a routine is, it feels especially important at the end of the day when you just want the night to go smoothly so you can finally breath and have your time for whatever it is you need to do.. go to bed early, enjoy a movie, do a puzzle, whatever. If he learns what needs to be done from when he gets in until the kids are asleep, I think he\u2019s fine to break the routine occasionally as long as he is taking over for the night from there.", "ESH, except the nanny.  You and your husband need better communication between both of you then you can both be on the same page regarding the kids and nanny.", "ESH.  You can\u2019t let the nanny \u201creplace\u201d him in the eyes of the kids, but husband also needs to suck it up and deal with the kids without help once he gets home.

I don't think either system is 'wrong'. Kids do thrive on routines but kids are also resilient and having different routines based on who is in the room is pretty normal and won't traumatize anyone. \n\nYou say this nanny is \"like a third parent\" but it kind of seems like you and her have the same philosophies which has made it easy to push Dad into the \"third parent\" position, which is understandably frustrating for him. I think if he wants to have his own routine with the kids, they can probably adjust and the nanny's job should be to support his relationship and routines with his children. \n\n...IDK though. I've never been a ROUTINES parent so it makes sense I'd take that side.", "NAH - It sounds more like communication is your issue, not necessarily the bedtime routine. \n\nEdit - updated judgment based on OPs comments.", "NAH \n\nI get him wanting to let the kids act a bit more freely the few times he's home, and you're also right in saying that he shouldn't change up the routine every time he's home. \n\nMaybe tell him to not always play nice, to do so only once in a while.\n\nEdit: You also need to understand that the usual routine can't be something that makes the kids bond with their father THAT much.", "YTA. Those daddy time disruptions are actually a benefit. Seems like otherwise, they wouldn't have a time to know/love their dad in an organic way.

Good luck.", "NAH.\n\nYou're obviously not wrong about how disruptive you husband can be to the routine... but I would seriously consider trying to find a way to integrate your husband into this without making him just defer to your nanny.\n\nThe man is trying to help out in the time he has. It's super important that he spends as much time as possible with his children, especially considering how often he is gone. He's literally doing what he is supposed to be doing, he's just not deferring as much as you would like to the details of how he does it.\n\nMaybe there is some more opportunity to get your husband to follow the same routine and methods that work, but I also think that him spending this kind of quality time with his children is more important that nailing the rhythm as routine.", "ESH.
