Horseplay and roughhousing are very important for your children's development. If Dad wants to take over and play hee-haw he can very well do that - that's great! But, what he can't do is take over, create a mess and then have the nanny come put out the fire. If the nanny is going to be taking care of business we play by her rules. If Dad is going to be taking care of business then we can play by his.", "NTA. Ignore the aggrieved men in the comments. If your husband wants to help with bedtime, then he needs to actually *help* with bedtime, not make it harder than it needs to be.

He's gone all the time for work. You and nanny are the primary \"parents\" in this situation. Maybe it's not the ideal situation, but that is the situation because of his job.

He's trying to Disney Dad his way out of his guilt over being a Mainly-Absent parent.  He needs to actually take responsibility for putting the kids to bed if he wants to disrupt the schedule.\n\nHe's being very disingenuous by whining about being \"replaced\" by the nanny, but also refusing to let her go home because he doesn't want to handle his own children alone.", "NTA. As their dad, it is his job to make sure they are healthy and happy, and sticking to their routine is the best way of doing that. (Aside from special occasions, of course.) Either he needs the nanny there or he doesn't, but he can't insist she stay and then make her job worse. I'm sure at his high profile job he would immediately sack someone who interfered with his ability to competently perform his duties.

Because that's the real problem. \n\n...My husband feels that she\u2019s just an employee and he\u2019s the dad.  - WOW.

That's how it goes when you're never home. He doesn't even want to parent. He takes the kids for an hour at a time and gives them junk. Then he hands them back to you or your nanny. NTA.", "NTA. The nanny is the expert on these kids' bath-and-bedtime. She's been doing it, she knows what's going on.

And if he wants to replace the nanny, he can handle it alone and deal with all that entails.", "NTA. Routine is important and if he's coming in and messing up the rhythm you guys have worked out, it's going to create issues. It sounds like your husband wants it both ways and that doesn't work as it is bound to confuse the kids and make problems.", "NTA but bigger issues. Probably an unpopular opinion. He's allowing the nanny to replace him via his regular absence. But his time with family should be encouraged as well. Rock and a hard place.", "~~N A H~~, I see both sides. If you guys aren't able to communicate effectively to focus on the needs of the children, instead of being hurt over each other's perfectly valid feelings, then you need a marriage counsellor to help you do that.\n\nEdit to provide additional context: \n\nOP:  \n>I\u2019ve wanted him to help more for awhile now. But his version of help is taking the kids for an hour, getting them sugared out. Which is fine sometimes but not all the time. He doesn\u2019t follow their routines at all, won\u2019t enforce rules. I\u2019m basically doing it all and am bad cop. (This is on weekends)\n\nMy response:  \n>The context that he's not their parent, but a buddy that shows up once every 3 months to horse play with them, puts this story firmly into NTA territory. I think marriage counseling should be on the table as an ultimatum.", "NTA. Its literally her job to keep the kids on a routine if his interfering is getting in the way of that then he is actually just wasting money hiring her. however, he is still their dad and probably wants to feel involved, maybe instead of framing it as the nanny is in charge frame it more like the nanny is more used to their routine/schedule and he has to learn/adjust to it and should follow her example for that.", "NTA, its like having a semi grown up fourth child who just comes home at times, does a bit of mad child minding and leave for the others to deal with the outcome. It isn't good for the kids and if he wants to spoil them, then either he needs to do it on his terms minus the nanny and take responsibility of putting them to bed and so on or just let nanny do her job. What he is doing is interrupting the mechanic while he's fixing the car by telling him how he should do it and then complaining that since he is paying for the mechanic he should abide by what he tells him. If you hire a professional, follow the lead as he/ she know what's best or else the nanny will always find someone else to pay her and it might be your family who will take time to find another nanny before things goes to normal. Stand your ground on this one.", " NTA because you are trying to make sure the nanny can do her job efficiently so she can presumably then go to her own home on time.", "NTA. Coming from a man with no kids, your husband has chosen to work where works and that means he has chosen to be involved with his kids as he is.\n\nIf you have to pay someone to make up for him not being there and being apart of their growth/development, he should shut up and not hinder their growth/development.\n\n(That's not even going into the gender role scenario their being exposed to.)", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut I would say if your husband wants to be the go to guy on a given evening, he should give the nanny the (paid) night off and take care of them himself.", "NTA.  you aren't having the nanny replace him.  this actually has nothing to do with your nanny.  you're simply asking him to coparent with you.  since you're there more often, you know what works best.  i'm not sure why he's having trouble respecting that, and you.  this isn't about her, or even you or him, it's about what's best for your kids.  they're still so young, and routines are so important.  their bodies benefit from knowing \"what's next\", on so many levels.  and it makes it easier on anyone who's taking care of them.  \n\nthere's a time for playing with dad (or mom, or anyone else for that matter), and a time to stick to the routine.  if he wants to be involved in the nightly routine, that's wonderful.  but \\*he\\* needs to be a part of \\*it\\*, not the other way around.  if he can't handle them when she isn't there, then he really does need to follow her lead.  what else is he going to do?  take the kids lead?  so they can roughhouse to their hearts content, not get enough sleep and be a wreck at school the next day?  if he's home on the weekends, let that be their play time.  you can deviate from the routine on the weekends.  \n\nbeing gone often is not an excuse to not be firm with your own kids.  that's guilt parenting.  he isn't a toy or a plaything and he needs to get himself out of that mindset.  he's responsible for bringing up 3 human beings and if he wants them to be good, responsible people, he has to actively be a part of that when he's there.", "If he wants to be a parent, the least he could do is to learn about the kids\u2019 routines and which times are best for such types of games. \n\nWhat does he expect? That when he suddenly has time to be with the kids, then all rules don\u2019t apply and everyone has to just adapt to his schedule? \n\nNono, definitely NTA", "NTA. In this case, it's whatever is best for the kids. He can't provide the structured routine the kids need, as he is not there most of the time. The nanny can. He should let her do her job.", "NTA. Your husband is though, seeing the Nanny as just an employee? Whilst this technically is true, he might want to think about how he and you would feel if she quit and you had to replace her.", "NTA - sounds like you and your nanny have a good system worked out. Your husband should be worked into the routine and he can learn what to do and not do.", "NTA. Dad needs to spend time with the kids/nanny at night a few times so he can get the swing of things and can be a helpful component when it comes to that routine. \n\nNow, it sound like he is missing his kids and wants to play with them (which must be hard working at all the times when you would be able to), so maybe try and find a way to schedule it in so he can be around when it's chaos time? I also would make sure to really re-assure him that there is no way that he could ever be replaced, and that his sacrifice to work so much to support the family doesn't go unnoticed. Heck, maybe you guys can work in a \"dad's home!\" part of the routine where he gets to do something all alone with the kids and have his dedicated father time - a special bedtime book, a non-stimulating game/show, etc.", "NTA, but why don't you swap when dad is home so the baby is put to bed by the nanny and the boys spend time with you and dad? Nanny can peace out while he parents.", "I think ESH, except your nanny. \n\nYou and your husband need to have a conversation about these things and come to an agreement and/or compromise together. I agree that your husband should respect the routine, but saying he has to defer to her or he\u2019s cut out isn\u2019t the right move imo. \n\nThey\u2019re both of your kids - as much as the nanny may feel like your third parent, she\u2019s not. Figure out how you two want to parent them and how your husband can still be involved in their lives, when he can, on the daily.\n\nAnd OP - if you guys can\u2019t have a productive conversation about these kind of things then you really need to work on your relationship.", "NTA he's causing unnecessary problems for everyone involved", "EDIT: Fixing judgment, made a typo. \n\nConsistency is hugely important for young children.  If the nanny has worked out a good system, both parents should go along with it.\n\nNTA", "I think NTA but _very slightly_ E-S-H.\n\nI only say the latter because I think you should be the one to school him on the routine. It\u2019s not the Nanny\u2019s responsibility to teach him how to care for his children, the same way he wouldn\u2019t teach her how to do his job.\n\nAt the same time they\u2019re his children and I imagine he looks forward to spending time with them when he can, which is obviously a great thing. If he really wants to be a responsible father figure though he needs to put the work in.. ALL the work. Not just show up and have fun, he need to know how to care for his children in all situations. If he doesn\u2019t want to learn then he totally needs to take a backseat and accept his role for what it is. \n\nI have 3 kids myself and understand how important a routine is, it feels especially important at the end of the day when you just want the night to go smoothly so you can finally breath and have your time for whatever it is you need to do.. go to bed early, enjoy a movie, do a puzzle, whatever. If he learns what needs to be done from when he gets in until the kids are asleep, I think he\u2019s fine to break the routine occasionally as long as he is taking over for the night from there.", "ESH, except the nanny.

Those daddy time disruptions are actually a benefit. Seems like otherwise, they wouldn't have a time to know/love their dad in an organic way.

Good luck.", "NAH.\n\nYou're obviously not wrong about how disruptive you husband can be to the routine... but I would seriously consider trying to find a way to integrate your husband into this without making him just defer to your nanny.\n\nThe man is trying to help out in the time he has. It's super important that he spends as much time as possible with his children, especially considering how often he is gone. He's literally doing what he is supposed to be doing, he's just not deferring as much as you would like to the details of how he does it.\n\nMaybe there is some more opportunity to get your husband to follow the same routine and methods that work, but I also think that him spending this kind of quality time with his children is more important that nailing the rhythm as routine.", "ESH. You even said the Nanny feels like a third parent. That should.not be the case. She is, in fact, an employee, regardless of what her job is.

I don\u2019t know the dealings with you family internally. However, I think people in these comments are so bifurcated that someone has to be in the middle and offer a reasonable explanation. \n\n3 kids and a nanny working overtime means you guys are very financially secure. Because you have such immense financial security, gained by what I am assuming is not a family inheritance or nepotism, your husband is probably working all day. \n\nI would also assume, his work does not stop on the weekends either.

He doesn\u2019t get to do that right now, because he is always working. He has to act as a primary provider, while you take on a job and kids because you have more time. \n\nNo one in this sub can tell you what the best thing to do is, but trying to break this issue down into one person being the asshole vs another I think is the wrong approach. \n\nIt\u2019s obvious something has to give here. Right now, it is the kids routine on some nights when he is present. You could work less so the fun he wants to have when he is there isn\u2019t a big deal to you. He could stop this fun business all together, but that will inevitably just result in him spending less time with the kids. \n\nI may be goin against the grain here but imo kids who never get to see their dad, deserve to have some fun when he is present a few nights a week, especially when you have a nanny whom you are paying to pick up the slack. \n\nUltimately, she is an employee and her job is not to be a parent, but a nanny. She isn\u2019t supposed to be a second parent, she is supposed to help watch the kids around the life that you and your husband have created. \n\nI think the best course of action here is to have your husband talk with you and her about how it is important for the kids to have fun while also doing their bed time routine. \n\nHe is paying for a service where he gets to enjoy his kids with the help of someone else taking care of the hard stuff. You are right, in that is a very unique problem. But ultimately, he should also get to enjoy watching his kids as he sees fit with the help of a nanny just as you do. \n\nYou are not the only one who gets to decide how the nanny is with the kids when he is there. You want him to be a more present parent then you need to treat him like one by giving him the room to do so. \n\nIf this was an issue to the point of your nanny wanting to quit, I might think differently. But her expressing how him being a fun father makes it harder on her, fairly or unfairly, is not his problem. She is a nanny doing a job and sometimes other factors can make that job harder. \n\nI think you two need to talk about what being a parent means when you have a nanny taking care of 75% of it and two parents working most of the time.

If this was me, I would focus more on how he's damaging his relationship with his own kids, and try counselling based on fixing that going forward\n\n\n\nI honestly don't know how to write this, but here goes\n\nTo answer your question, NTA. The nanny is a core part of the kids life and kids need routine. The nanny, at least for the foreseeable future it seems, is in charge at that point of the day. Your husband is also damaging his relationship with the kids by not being firm. If he is only the 'fun one', it'll be very difficult for him to change that later and have a more healthy relationship with them later. Relationships require dialogue and respect, and if they can always walk all over them, he won't get their respect easily.\n\nThe tough part, as many have said, is the inherent sexism in society. Unfortunately that is a learned behaviour that continues to be perpetuated. Odds are, he feels like he's trying to be a better father than other fathers he's seen in his life, and he might well be right. However, 'better' doesn't always translate into 'good'. So on this front I think it's important to recognise his effort, if he is trying to be 'better', and try guide him towards 'good'.\n\nOne other thing you said stuck out for me: referring to the nanny as an employee. I'd suggest taking the angle of 'you don't interfere with the work of an expert in your organisation, even if you want to be involved. You ask them to get you up to speed and how you can help'. Your approach is already along this line, but phrasing it differently might help him understand where he is coming from.\n\nAnd of course there is the impact of this on you. You have the nanny because you need help, and him undermining the nanny makes it harder for you. Couples therapy could be beneficial, particularly if it focuses on how to be better parents together, given your situation.\n\nAll the best!", "The bottom line is he thinks it's ok to be the \"fun\" parent to compensate for his absence. It's not.\n\nIf he (seriously) cannot cope without the nanny at bathtime then he needs to step back. Can he take them and read a bedtime story? Something which doesn't disrupt the kids getting ready for bed. And perhaps the bedtime story is the best fun part he can participate in which meets everyone's needs. \n\nThink of the nanny as a chef. Would he want to stick his spoon in her cooking or keep out of it? It matters not who is the employee if one person is effective and another is not. NTA", "NAH\n\n>Obviously she doesn\u2019t want to undermine her employer but it just makes her job harder.\n\nYou and your husband are the parents. Your husband is having fun. While it messes up their schedule, they'll also have fond memories of daddy. Will they remember being fed and bathed on schedule? Maybe. More likely to remember when dad would come home and play fight. Does he need to be more involved,  probably.  But that is what he's doing just in a different way. You both need a serious conversation about division of work when it comes to the kids. But again, at the end of the day, you are both their parents. Nanny could quit tomorrow or next year. \n\nIf he's really affecting her job, find an alternative to make it easier for the nanny on those days. For example if hubby comes home on time,  she gets to leave. He doesn't get to avoid responsibility and make her job harder. That way she doesn't have a harder time putting them to bed. You also don't get to avoid co-parenting with him by using the nanny as the person \"in charge\". The more he gets to experience it, the better you'll both find a parenting groove with each other.", "I want a comment but everybody else has said it so much better. I'm of the opinion that if he wants her to stay and he can't handle it himself. He needs to partake in established rules. He's gonna find out when those kids grow up that being the fun parent isnt all it's cracked up to be", "NTA. Your husband is not being a dad lol.

Dude needs a wake up call, parenting is not a fun hobby, it's a real responsibility and commitment.\n\nThis to me is a clear case of needing to compromise. I wouldn't recommend trying to put the nanny in charge, that's just triggering all kinds of personal and professional issues - wounded egos, employer/employee relationship etc etc. Regardless of right or wrong, a big thing to understand is that he needs to feel like he has input and a say in his children's lives as well. By putting the nanny in charge, you're taking that away from him.\n\nOn the flipside, he needs to accept that there are rules in the house for the children, and those rules are there for a good reason.

I understand he's bringing home the bacon for his family, but his kids need him too, in a regular dad role, not part-time. But, you are NTA.", "NTA.  Dad is enjoying his career, which I\u2019m sure he worked very hard for, but he\u2019s not parenting.\nI\u2019m sure he misses his kids and wants fun time with them when he gets home, but as a parent of two kids around this age I agree that routines are everything.\nMom and Nanny have a system that works for everyone and Dad needs to see that.  It\u2019s not that he\u2019s been replaced, or has lost control of his home, instead he should want to enable the Nanny that they pay good money to do her job.\n\nOn the other hand\n\nI say all this as a working Dad with a seriously demanding career also. It\u2019s hard.  Yes, I would bet that OP\u2019s husband has days that feel like he\u2019s not gonna make it through.  Going from a cut-throat career environment to your sweet, innocent kids is a massive contrast and I\u2019m guessing that getting some fun time in is therapeutic for Dad, too.\nGiven that, an approach based in mutual respect is what\u2019s needed here.  Work out ways that Dad & kids can have fun times that don\u2019t wreck the kids\u2019 and nanny\u2019s routine.  Have a conversation about why these things matter.\nFinally - can we stop lumping dads into the same dumb, bumbling, ignorant bucket???  It\u2019s 2023 and we don\u2019t do that with any group except for dads and it\u2019s beyond gross.  Some dads work their ass off AND are a father to their kids and a husband to their wife.", "NTA\n\nIt's important for both parents to take an active role in parenting their children.

Your nanny is good for everyone, including him...that he can't recognize that shows how self-involved he is.

I would tell your husband that the nanny was hired for her expertise with handling the kids. He needs to let her do the job she was hired for and reinforce her authority to the kids.

Routines are very important for kids, and it\u2019s very easy to break them, and they can even feel unimportant when you are not the one dealing with the consequences.

I have been in child care for nearly 20 years from preschool daycare settings to private care in their home and mine. Most of my education has been in infants and toddlers. The line that really irked me here was \u201chis salary does pay her\u201d \u2026 his salary can\u2019t buy their healthy development and it can\u2019t erase the confusion they are left to navigate when their routine is disrupted but they still have to meet the expectations.

It helps them feels safe, know what to expect, what is expected of them, and they get an anxiety they cannot express when it\u2019s changed. You (the primary caregiver) have to start the process again reinforcing the rules, routines, etc. An integral part of that is them knowing who is keeping them  safe, i.e. who is in charge. When I\u2019m working in a family\u2019s home and they are working in/around them home they know I am \u201cin charge\u201d and their parents back me in that when they question them.

When the nanny is \u201con the clock\u201d they are in charge. Ask your husband if a coworker started telling him what to while his boss was there who should he listen to.

The family I was with then was amazing. We were a great fit together with a lot of personal beliefs and shared interests with their boys, but it went further than that. Every day, at the end of my day with them, I would make sure the boys had something keeping their attention, and I would go and debrief with the parents. Because of this, we could make sure we were always on the same page and on the \"same side\" (which, you know with kids is not being against them, just being able to give clear and consistent messaging \ud83d\ude0f)\n\nBoth parents were working at home when I started (because Covid) and one was always fully remote. They fully were there for the first few days as the boys got used to me (AND distance learning, and all of the extreme change of early quarantine, all at the same time) and as it was appropriate also enforced boundaries for their work day and always reminded the boys that I was \"the Boss\" while I was there. I.E. they couldn't run to anyone else if I enforced a rule. \n\nObviously, that requires a ton of trust on both ends, but because we were able to establish that, they became my second family. It sounds to me that you are building that type of relationship but your husband is not. I feel that without that trust and experience I would venture towards N A H, EXCEPT that part of the reason that the whole dynamic worked with me and my nanny fam is that the parents had already made sure that they were always going to be inline with each other with clear guidelines and great communication. Because they had established that with each other, they were able to incorporate me. \n\nYour husband has been gone, and that's not necessarily to put blame on that.

He wouldn\u2019t be very happy, would he? But by his logic that\u2019s totally OK because the boss is in charge.", "NTA. However I will say it's not what you say but how you say it; to some people unfortunately. Should you have too coddle his feelings ? No. However as you stated yourself his income does pay for the nanny. That is if you want peace with some men. Not all men. However you live in reality and not a fantasy so you have to accept ultimately as you stated yourself this is a very priveledged issue to have. Many single parents doing \ud83d\udcaf with no support. With that you get the fortunate opportunity to move like a ninja!  You can bicker and go back and forth. Or you can stroke his ego.

Then gently remind him bc he's such a great provider that y'all were able to get an excellent and well qualified professional. As such her system is what she knows and it works best for her and allows her to be the awesome nanny. He would be such a great help if he could please follow her lead and not created an environment that makes it difficult for her to do her most efficient work.

I was the baby and didn't have a cousin my age, so I'd go to the library and hardware stores with Dad on weekends and I have so many great memories with him.
