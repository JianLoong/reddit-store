Maybe their baby daddies should get them cheesecake, if they even know who they are that is.", "no one is taking anything too far lmao nor is anyone cancelling ops friends. all they said was that they should ask instead of demanding and not taking no for an answer. seems like the only sensitive one is you seeing as you jumped to talking about cancelling people.", "NTA.\n\nThey will not shrivel up and die for not satisfying a craving at that exact moment.\n\nAlso it's pretty unlikely that they were both having the same craving at once, especially the 7 weeker.  They just wanted free cheesecake.  However, they went way over the line for continuing to persist even though you were in bed.\n\nI'd probably let it slide this once - pregnancy scatterbrain is a thing - but don't let them start a pattern of expecting you to do unreasonable things for them just because they are pregnant.", "Ummm why are you their chauffeur and servant? Being friends with them sounds exhausting", "Where are their baby daddies? Fetching food they crave is daddy's job, not yours. NTA.", "They should\u2019ve DoorDash GrubHub or Uber eats or ask their baby daddy. How entitled of them. You didn\u2019t knock them up they need to ask their babys father!!!", "NTA.  Don't even start doing this for them.  You need to be too busy to answer the phone or respond to texts until they start asking someone else.", "NTA\n\n#LOL I ASSUMED THEY WERE \\*\\*SELLING\\*\\* CHEESECAKE\n\nThey can get out of here with this entitled nonsense.", "NTA\n\nYou're not a free Doordash", "NTA \n\nYou\u2019re not the person who got them pregnant. You\u2019re their friend, they need to understand that they can\u2019t have everything they want when they want it. I know how intense cravings can get (I\u2019ve been pregnant twice) but if a friend is not available to take me to the store or to go to the store for me I would not sit there and make them feel like crap for wanting to nap.", "NTA. They are adults. They can Uber to the restaurant.", "NTA. Why are you the only on available to help them ?", "NTA.\n\nPlus,  most people don't even know they're pregnant at 7 weeks, let alone have cravings that early.", "NTA \n\nPut an end to this NOW or you\u2019ll be dealing with this for the next 8 months.  You are not their errand girl.\n\nStop with the \u201cthey\u2019re pregnant so they can\u2019t\u201d attitude.  They can both still walk, talk, and - and this one\u2019s the kicker - call an uber or a cab to take them.  They can also call the people who, you know, IMPREGNATED THEM.", "What time of the day was this? Why can't they walk/take public transport? \n\nActually, regardless of the answers to the above - why is this YOUR responsibility? They're old enough to do for themselves. NTA", "NTA for reasons already mentioned everywhere else, but also driving tired is unsafe for everyone including yourself \ud83d\ude43", "NTA you didn't get them pregnant", "NTA. They could go and get it themselves. Why weren\u2019t they at work anyways?", "NTA. They could have took an Uber or something. That is not your job.", "NTA You want cheesecake? Get off your ass and get it yourself. This pregnancy craving sh*t excuse is stupid.", "NTA.  Why did they call you???   Also, \u201ccravings\u201d that early in a pregnancy???   Nope. They can order something delivered (doesn\u2019t have to be that exact cheesecake!) or wait till someone is AVAILABLE!!  You were not available!!  You had something YOU needed to do.  Nap!   They aren\u2019t your responsibility", "NTA. I'd NEVER call my friend asking them to stop whatever theyre doing to bring over a snack because I couldn't get it myself. What a joke.", "That you even had to ask. \ud83d\ude16", "NTA. Are they going to expect you to be their taxi once the babies arrive, too? Create boundaries now.", "Is either of them carrying your baby? Why can't they drive,  neither is in the third trimester? Is Uber a thing where you guys live?\n\nNTA. Although now im craving cheesecake. \ud83d\ude2b", "NTA. Why are you their caretaker?  Do not let them treat you like their doormat?  Where are the guys that knocked them up?", "NTA and I\u2019m pregnant, so yeah I am definitely in the I need this food mode. It\u2019s scary that they don\u2019t have cars, and are so young. If they can\u2019t afford cars how can they afford children? Maybe they should be saving money and eating some cream cheese and fruit instead. Babies aren\u2019t cheap. Every part of their situation is a face palm.", "I mean, you did knock them up right? Do the right thing", "NTA  - Firstly they are not your babies, therefore not your problem. Ask the baby daddy or family members to run food errands.\n\nSecondly being preggo doesn\u2019t mean everyone has to drop everything and bow down their every need. They\u2019re growing a baby, not the next coming of baby Jesus Christ himself. \n\nA craving is a want not a need. Eating for two is also a giant myth. You\u2019re only supposed to be eating an extra 300 calories unless you want to deal with having gestational diabetes which is on the rise in pregnant women. Trust me it ain\u2019t nice! \n\nThey shouldn\u2019t be putting your safety at risk by driving tired. They don\u2019t sound like good friends to be honest.", "NTA.  It\u2019s nice to help your friends when you can, but you have zero obligation to be their delivery service everytime they want something", "Oh hell no. I hate the excuse that you are pregnant and craving things. I\u2019m not pregnant and was craving tacos last night. Big fucking deal. I have three kids and I appreciate all that goes along with being so. I was sick for my entire pregnancy with two of my kids and I didn\u2019t expect anyone to jump when I wanted something. Granted if it could be done someone usually offered, but I lost 30 lb with each pregnancy so if I actually ate it was an accomplishment!\n\nDon\u2019t feel bad & please don\u2019t start. You will be doing it until they are both done having kids & no one needs that", "NTA. Why aren't they asking their baby daddies, parents etc.?", "Uhh where TF are their partners and/or family? \n\n\nNTA", "Just nope. If you start catering to them now, you will be the \"friend\" they will use and abuse. There are countless articles in reddit where girls who think \"Mary\" and 'susie' are their bff then later find out they talk sh!t behind their back. Let me guess here, Did they expect you to pay as well??? Yeah, I thought so. If you're uncomfortable telling them no, do what I tell my girls to do. Tell them \"mom said no\" I'll take the blame every single time", "Where are the baby daddies? They got them pregnant, not you. If they aren\u2019t in the picture, they are still responsible for their own life choices. Their pregnancies are not in any way your responsibility. If you don\u2019t set boundaries now, they will continue to expect you to cater to their every whim for the rest of the pregnancy. Set your boundaries NOW. \n\nI also have a very hard time believing they both have a true pregnancy craving for the same thing at the same time and are the type who will expect the world to stop just for them. \n\nNTA", "I'm not following why they can't go themselves, what difference does being pregnant make? NTA", "NTA. Their cravings aren\u2019t your responsible. Oh and the 7 weeker is milking it. They\u2019re no cravings that early.", "I'm sorry, are you the father? /s\n\nTell them to ask their baby daddy and leave you the f alone.  I thought you were with them and they lost their wallets and needed you to buy them cheesecake.  Then it would make sense.  But no. You're not responsible for their cravings just bc you have access to a car.  \n\nYour \"friends\" are crap and you need better friends\nNTA", "Pregnant does not mean helpless and it doesn't mean entitled. They can live with out the cheese cake. Please do not jump though hoops for these \"freinds\" or your going to end up raising their kids for them. Where are the fathers of these babies they are the ones required to provide for the craving.", "Oh please.\n\nThere's nothing hormonal about this and this wasn't a craving... they just wanted cake and thought you were a big enough sucker to fall for their \"but I'm pregnant\" whining.\n\nNTA", "Umm NTA: they can have patience. Or get cheesecake themselves. I was driving at those stages. Or they can Uber or whatever but I would never wake a friend up to ask them to bring me food. Hell I don\u2019t even do that if I knew they were awake\u2026.", "NTA also where are their baby daddy's? Make them get cheesecake at unreasonable hours.. You didn't get your friends pregnant so it's not your responsibility to satisfy cravings.", "You are NTA regardless but we're you honestly the ONLY person either of these people could call up? Where's their support system? The father's? Their family? I know everyone's situation is different and there's no judgement there but seriously? The world's of your friends don't stop because you're pregnant and carless", "NTA, what the hell! Even if your reason was just 'I don't want to', you wouldn't be TA! They asked, and I suppose just asking didn't make them TA until they decided to insist. That 100% made them assholes. Pregnancy cravings are not royal decrees. And even if they were, the ones obligated to cater to those would be the people who got them pregnant. You did the right thing for yourself, OP. Your safety is much more important than their cravings.", "NTA did they even invite you to join them? They don\u2019t really sounds like great friends.", "I don't understand why they can't get it themselves. Many pregnant women work full time. Are they both on bedrest? And even if they are, fulfilling a craving is not a necessity, and where are the baby daddies?", "NTA, where tf are the dads who should be getting them cheesecake?", "NTA\n\nReal, honest to God, I will either cry or burn the world to the ground pregnancy cravings don't usually hit until second trimester. Also you didn't get them pregnant, you don't have to sacrifice your comfort and sleep for anyone else, and they clearly don't respect the word no. Being pregnant can be hard but it doesn't mean every one else bows to your whims.", "Are you the father of their kids? If not, you don't have to. NTA.", "Not the Arsehole . Were these two people going to pay for said cheesecake? I doubt it very much. Don\u2019t give in at all because the moment you do You will be paying for Everything", "NTA at 7 weeks pregnant you can easily go and get your own cheesecake. Taxis and public transport exist. Exceptions being if she's experiencing some form of complication or medical condition.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t get them pregnant.", "Nta I\u2019m sorry did you impregnate both of these women? No it\u2019s not your responsibility to \u201cget them their cravings\u201d that\u2019s what their parents or their baby daddies are for not you", "NTA. i\u2019m tired of pregnant people feeling entitled to everyone else\u2019s time simply because they had unprotected seks.", "This is ridiculous.  Pregnant women \"crave\" food just like anyone else. NTA. Pregnancy cravings are completely BS. Mother of Three.", "NTA \ud83e\udd23 I would have told them no, hung up on them and put my phone on silent \u2026.  then gone back to sleep! Your much nicer than I am. I would shoot them a text though to call you if they are in labor but you will not be getting them any good because they are craving it, their baby daddies can do that.", "NTA at all that was v rude of them", "7 weeks pregnant is not really when you need to go out of your way to help somebody, sounds like she was just using the \"I'm pregnant card\". NTA not your responsibility.", "I wouldn't even ask this of my husband, let alone a friend. I usually solve my cravings myself or I do without. It's not like anything bad is going to happen to you if you don't get it \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. It feels like people are making way to big of a deal about cravings these days", "Yea they can go ride a bike, take a bus, take a cab, Uber, have it delivered by a company. They have lots of options.", "I think if OP had said yes now, they would take advantage of that generosity and make it a regular thing. Well done for standing your ground OP! \n\nAlso, one of them is only 7 weeks pregnant, wtf is stopping her from getting cheesecake? I\u2019m pretty sure people still work until they\u2019re almost due to give birth, not take bed rest at 7 weeks and refuse to do anything lol", ">Or, and here's a crazy thought, 20 year olds should learn how to drive and be independent before having kids.\n\n\nI have adult *grandchildren* and I don't drive. I am independent in that I don't have others drive for me.", "It\u2019s definitely a thing early on as well\ud83d\ude02 but regardless. NTA. They need to share an Uber and have a nice time out together", "I had the strongest cravings for garlic at 7 weeks. It was bad. Garlic toast for breakfast, extra garlic on pizza, we ate Italian up until my missed miscarriage brought the hormones down. It's unusual but possible. But I'm op is NTA and I hate it when pregnant women froth at the mouth 'buuuut I have a craving!!!' 1000% with you cravings aren't needs. They can make their own damn cheesecake. Doubt they would have covered the gas, cost of cheesecake, wear and tear on vehicle etc.", "Hell no that\u2019s not true. The very reason I knew I was pregnant both times was incredibly strong cravings. My cravings were stronger and more specific in my first trimesters than the rest of the pregnancy.\n\nTurns out pregnancies are highly variable.", "i started craving bacon before i even tested myself. that\u2019s how i knew i was pregnant, meat cravings and i was a vegetarian at the time.", "Agreed. Also, you don\u2019t have to give into every craving. If I did I would have been enormous at the end of my pregnancy. I already had a big belly because of a huuuge baby (4.4 kilos). Extra weight would have made it harder to walk and be active.\n\nI tried to eat as healthy as possible with less healthy food once in a while. I only gave into my fruit craving. While sometimes less healthy food isn\u2019t wrong a pregnant woman should try to eat as healthy as possible. Pregnancy is already hard for a body but the right food might help a bit with energy and strength.", "I'm not sure where you got your information. Cravings are more likely to occur in the first and second trimesters. I first knew I was pregnant due to cravings!", "I had cravings before I even knew I was pregnant, it's just like you start thinking about a certain food and that thought gets stuck immediately and all you want is that damn food.\n\nThat said... There were many days that I just had to deal with that feeling. And I didn't die from not getting what I craved, sure, it'd have been nice, but if it's not possible, it's not. Also, for me, if I craved x on Monday, I'll be still craving x on Thursday. It's nothing that makes you wake up others to go get that food for you right now then and there.", "Cravings weren\u2019t a thing for me my whole pregnancy and even when I wanted something (like KitKat in the last weeks) I just waited for a normal walk to the store to get it then.", "> talkin' bout getting pregnant while still too young to drink \n\nSeriously, it's like \u2014 how are you expecting to manage your stress once the kid arrives?!?", "What are they going to do once the babies are born? Will they use public transport to get everywhere? Will they rely on their mothers or friends to drive them wherever? Will they just wait for their husbands to take them and just never go out otherwise? What will they do if a medical emergency happens to one of the kids? Just wait? What if their spouses get hurt? Are you prepared to be an unpaid on-call chauffeur and nanny? Because unless they get their own shit together and/or you start to set appropriate boundaries, this will likely happen. This is your life and there are no re-takes, do overs, or extra lives. You will never get more time, only lose it. Do you want to spend your non-refundable time only enriching other people's lives at the detriment of your own? A true friend would never want that for you, so why are they demanding/expecting that of you?", "I'm pregnant and I wouldn't even make my husband do something like this, let alone a friend! NTA.", "Thank you for pointing out that they are married. So many people quick to assume they were single or didn\u2019t know who the fathers are\ud83d\ude44but you\u2019re NTA", "Ugh I\u2019m barely making it 2 miles a day now and I used to do 5-7, I guess I might have hyperemesis though. I\u2019m gagging and retching all the time.", "Not if they're really close it's not rude. Everyone just seems so formal with their friends in my opinion. Personally, I would want my friends to bother me like this. Let me be there for them the same way they would for me. Maybe thats just me. If I can't or don't feel like it that's that and if they can't that's that. OP said there was not a fight between the friends and she just felt bad so im assuming everything went back to normal. If the friends got angry at OP for not taking them its a different story. Everyone is thinking too deep into this and taking this way out of proportion. People need to lighten up a little.", "Hm I just had to think of a food and it would live in my mind. Maybe one of them mentioned it and it became a thing. But at 7 weeks I was struggling to keep things down. \n\nOP, pregnancies are known to go on for months. Do you really want to establish yourself as the go-to cravings person this early on? Don't be TA to yourself. Don't set this precedent.", "Not completely true my first pregnancy I carved all sorts in the first few weeks particularly oranges I\u2019d eat 5/6 a day. throughout the pregnancy I craved lots of different things, I once dreamt of a weird sandwich that I had to get up at 2 am and make it. my second pregnancy I craved nothing but I couldn\u2019t keep anything down at all so that\u2019s probably why.", "The closest I came to cravings was, \"that food doesn't seem like it'll make me throw up!\" Starting at six weeks I was throwing up everything I thought about eating. That's actually how I figured out I was pregnant, I smelled baking bread and hurled. But that was my whole pregnancy. I kept expecting cravings and nothing.", "Same. I got pregnant December 1st (IVF) and within like 2 weeks I was craving beef jerky non stop. I ran out on Christmas Day and ended up crying because I couldn\u2019t find any lmao", "Same, my cravings were strongest in first tri", "Right? All three of my pregnancies had me craving food like crazy. \n\nI had a feeling something was up with my third when I couldn't stop thinking about pineapple and coconut, and how bad I needed them in my face \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nWell.. that and the.. yanno.. wanting to puke every morning \ud83d\ude05", "My second pregnancy had me craving pho like it was going out of style.", "I had few cravings but the food avoidance e started early.  I had to live on V8 and ginger ale for two weeks once during the first trimester.", "I personally didn't have cravings until my second trimester. My first sign of pregnancy is uncontrollable vomiting. Although with my second pregnancy I drank Pickle juice because I heard it helped with dehydration and to replace electrolytes it tasted SO amazing I drank half the jar \ud83d\ude02 haven't done it before or since though.", "I craved beetroot and sharp cheese sandwiches haha", "Garlic was an avoidance food for my third pregnancy (and for my grandmother for all of her babies, funny enough). Working at Starbucks and the everything bagel would toast.. the burned garlic smell would hit me and I'd be in the washroom, gagging \ud83d\ude05\ud83d\ude05", "Same! I started craving salami out of nowhere.. After having been a vegetarian for approximately 4 years before that.", "Or just use fucking Grubhub.", ">If I can't or don't feel like it that's that and if they can't that's that.\n\nWell, that was exactly the problem here: OP did say no but they kept asking over and over. Sure, it's totally fine to ask a friend a favour, but it's *not* fine to keep insisting when they say no. Being pregnant isn't an excuse for bad manners. Instead of continuing to demand this from OP, they should have made alternate plans, like try asking someone else or ordering a different kind of cheesecake.", "I can't even get good pho where I'm at, I'm gonna have to learn to make it.", "Other people here have a level of objectivity that you don\u2019t.  You had to tell them no multiple times before they finally took no for an answer.  That\u2019s entitlement.  They think they\u2019re entitled to beg, plead, and wear you down all because they\u2019re pregnant.  They have partners.  They can handle their cravings."]}
