So here you want \"safe and respectful\", but yo defend the friends that do exactly the opposite in real life?", "You don\u2019t want harshness but you came here? Are you new to this subreddit ? Get ready to duck!", "Could they not have called the fathers of their babies?", "I\u2019m surprised by all the downvotes on this. I guess this sub is more transphobic than I thought.", "They are, but if she was trans and had gotten them pregnant she wouldn\u2019t have simply called them friends they would be baby mamas so saying that she got them pregnant seems like a major stretch.", "U are taking this WAY too far. 2 pregnant ladies (which more importantly they are OPs close friends) asked OP to get them cheesecake and it's the end of the world for them? Imagine this was on tiktok or something these 2 friends would get COMPLETELY CANCELED for something so small by the whole world. Smh people like u are too sensitive these days.", "Extremely biphobic too. I got equal downvotes and upvotes when I reminded people on a different post that there are more than three sexualities because they made a biphobic statement since the OP stated both OP and her wife were lesbians.", "That's extremely racist", "What she is saying is that while you are all \"BFFS\", the way you treat each other is sh\\*t. Real friends may ask a friend to pick up cheesecake for them but they don't badger about it. Especially when that friend was asleep, drowsy and had a responsibility they  had to do(pick up your sis). So in the end, your friends are the AH's. And you defending their poor behavior makes you an AH too. And as you can see by all the comments, everyone thinks they are AH's and you for making excuses for AHs. Maybe their baby daddies should get them cheesecake, if they even know who they are that is.", "no one is taking anything too far lmao nor is anyone cancelling ops friends. all they said was that they should ask instead of demanding and not taking no for an answer. seems like the only sensitive one is you seeing as you jumped to talking about cancelling people."]}
