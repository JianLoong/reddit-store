When my sister finished she came over and had trouble getting through the lobby. Apparently my sister had left our key somewhere in the grocery store. My gf was furious and very upset. She accused my sister of being careless and told her that she put our lives at risk. I tried to get my gf to calm down. At this point I should note that my demeanor was very calm and my gf noted it. She got mad at me next and asked me why I wasn't as angry as she was. I told her that I don't think we have to worry too much because it is unlikely someone will find our key and know which house/apartment the key belongs to. My gf got even more mad at me and told me that the odds of that happening were a lot higher than I was making it out to be and she told me and my sister that I had to go find it. \n\nI left with my sister to retrace her steps but ultimately we couldn't find the key. I called me gf and told her I was going home. She told me we needed to call a locksmith immediately. I told her we had to speak with the landlord. She told me she was really frustrated that I am not prioritizing our safety. \n\nThe landlord did eventually come this Monday and changed our locks but now my gf is giving me the silent treatment.

This is a crazy overreaction. Did she think someone would find the key and then check every single door in town. Plus if someone wants to rob you that bad they'll find a way in. Your gf is acting over the top here, which makes me wonder if there is some unresolved trauma.", "NTA. Matching her level of emotionality about it isn\u2019t going to help. You said you kept a calm demeanor, which is good in stressful situations. Someone has to be the rational one.  I think it\u2019s funny that she wanted you to act more upset but she wasn\u2019t going to act more calm. What, were you supposed to theatrically pretend?  Also, giving you the silent treatment is immature.  \n  \n  \nedit, spelling", "Talk about her overreaction!!! It's a key!! ***Unless it had a tag with your FULL address how exactly would anyone who finds that key know which door it freaking fits? Like in your entire complex, neighborhood, city or state!!***     NTA", "NTA.  Someone needs to keep a cool head.", "NTA. Your GF needs a course in statistics and logic.", "NTA. gf overreacted, what are the odds someone could find your key and go place to place until they finally found your place while not getting caught in the process? While I agree, \"never say never,\" I feel you\u2019d be more likely to get struck by lightning than have this scenario happen.", "NTA,\n\nThe locks were changed, which is how to make sure you're safe. Losing keys is quite irresponsible but everyone getting very angry and emotional isn't going to solve anything.\n\nI'm quite emotional and can get upset quickly by small things and my boyf keeps his cool generally and we solve our concerns thoughtfully and together. It balances me out that he is calm and my concerns help for us to think about what we need to address. Two emotional people make a situation messy.\n\nThat being said, maybe validating that she was concerned for her safety in a gentle way could have met her in the middle.", "NTA.\n\nYes, your GF irrationally overreacted. She may never tell you the real reasons for her over the top reaction. \n\nMight be wise to get a simply safe or other easily installed alarm system, and you can change your codes regularly.\n\nPeace of mind, you know.", "NTA. She way overreacted. Keys get lost all the time. Unless the key has your address/name on it then she overreacted.", "NTA. Your gf over reacted. Losing something if what makes us human. If it really is a big deal to her than you can always change the locks. It is an easy fix.", "NTA. This is such an odd reaction. Unless you have your address printed on the key itself, why does she think someone will match the key to your house? It sounds like her fear is stemming from anxiety, but this level of reaction implies her anxiety is causing her to stress about situations far more than what is a reasonable reaction. Has she had similar reactions previously?", "Panic is always the enemy. It never helps, only hinders. You solved the situation without anger, fear, panic. So, what's the benefit of those extreme emotions? None.", "NTA. You did the right thing. You were calm. You helped your sister look for it. Saying you\u2019re not prioritizing y\u2019all safety is a stretch. You changed the locks Shit happens.  \n\nAnd I understand that is women want to feel like\nour significant other is on our side 100% (right or wrong)  I would definitely ask your gf what she expects out of you when future discourse happens.", "NTA.  Time to take a good, long look at your gf.  Is she so perfect she never lost anything?  Does she think the person that finds the key is a psychic and can tell to which house it belongs?  She went so overboard.  If I was the landlord, I would have laughed at her.  Who on earth has seven sets of keys to their house?!  You get a set of keys, an emergency set and one set for guests.", "Uh, she's flipping out over it being a safety issue, but knowingly granted out SEVEN sets of keys to your place?  That seems rather incongruent. She needs to relax.", "QUESTION: Has your gf or anyone close to her ever been a victim of violent crime?\n\nAnd\u2026\n\nDoes your sister\u2019s key have a tag on it with anything that identifies your home?", "NTA\n\nI think your gfs reaction was a bit over the top, being scared is one thing but then she attacked your sister - keys are small, they get lost especially if not on her key ring, it could very well be in a pocket or in her car. then she attacked you - you went out to look for the key but you weren\u2019t prioritizing your guys\u2019 safety? she could have called a locksmith or landlord herself while you were out. \n\nit doesn\u2019t help anything to panic in a scary situation & the silent treatment now that it\u2019s you have new locks and the problems gone is immature.", "Wait, how would someone know what the key was for? Sounds like she is over reacting for sure.", "NTA. Your girlfriend is acting like a child.", "NTA. I left my house key on a bus once by accident, did I change the locks? No. I lost my key 6 years ago, no one has used it to get in my house so far.", "NTA - Hope this is an isolated incident and that you gf doesn\u2019t react this way in all situations in which she\u2019s stressed.", "NTA.  Sister losing the key is mildly annoying but how does your GF think that somebody is going to magically know which house/apartment belongs to that key?  Is it marked?  Without an address or name on the key it is virtually impossible for somebody to show up and unlock YOUR door.", "NTA, I also read your post history and you should seriously consider your future with her.", "NTA, her response is irrational and a complete overreaction.  I would consider this kind of behavior a huge red flag. She is either not well or it has nothing to do with the key.", "She\u2019s being childish. Nta.", "Man don\u2019t give so many people your keys", "ESH - Ita highly unlikely someone would find the key and match it but never say never. Your gf sounds as though she\u2019s being a bit over the top but in all fairness you didn\u2019t take her safety concerns seriously. Try and see where she is coming from, the thought of some random person letting themselves into your apartment is pretty terrifying. She\u2019s allowed to have fears, instead of dismissing them you should try to console her and find a solution from the beginning to make her feel like you truly do care about her safety instead of telling her how to feel/react.", "No one sucks here\n\nYour girlfriend is NTA because she has the right to be upset even though the situation would\u2019ve been handled a lot better if she was calmer she did nothing wrong\n\nYou\u2019re NTA because you were level headed and tried to control the situation when she was too upset to focus on solving it rather than just being upset.", "YTA\n\n>She accused my sister of being careless and told her that she put our lives at risk. I tried to get my gf to calm down\n\nYour GF is right.  It's never great to have random keys to your home just floating around where ANYONE could get ahold of them.  You repeatedly saying something like \"Baby, calm down!\" likely came off as condescending in the moment - No one in the history of time has ever calmed down in the moment just because someone told them to like that.\n\nShe was scared and rather than reassuring her, you repeatedly told her she was worried about nothing and minimized her fears.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That sounds like a pretty big overreaction, and it makes me wonder what's drove your gf to that extreme. In any case, panicking wouldn't have solved anything or gotten the situation handled faster. As an aside, having 7 sets of keys with several out to different family members is excessive. Would she have been that angry if it had been her mom had lost the key? Anyway you got the locks changed, so that's handled. Now you need to figure out why your gf felt so extremely unsafe in that moment. Maybe she's had a stalker before. She's being short with you now because she doesn't feel like you really acknowledged her concerns. The silent treatment part is problematic, though. You both need to come to an agreement on how you handle conflict.", "Nta. Accidents happen. Your girlfriend is really escalating the situation. It's extremely unlikely anyone would be able to figure out which apartments you're in. My first thought was she doesn't like your sister and wants you to be mad at her so your relationship with your sis will suffer. ETA There's a saying that you never truly know someone until you live with them. Everyone takes their mask off at home.", "NTA. Is this her first time living outside her parents home? This is crazy overreaction. There\u2019s absolutely no way someone would find it and know what it goes to lmao.

The spots can be several different heights. For argument's sake, let's say there are 4 valleys on a key. Now let's say that each cut has 5 positions. that means you have 54 =625 different combinations for the top part of the key. So, for every 625 key holes, your key should open 1. Now, you have other parts that make the key unique. Take a set of keys, and look at it from the end. There are little groves there that can be made in any of dozens of ways. My car key looks very different from my house key, and my house key looks very different from my the house key of my old house. So, while these keys could have the same pattern of cuts in them, you couldn't fit them in the other key holes.  \n\n\nIt's statistically next to impossible for a random person to find that key and randomly try your lock.", "NTA.

You sister was careless and put your lives at risk. You were dismissive of your GF's very real safety and security concerns. You did not know if the keys were lost or stolen! \n\nGlad you landlord was able to change the locks. Hopefully, your sister will cover any charges as it was her fault. I'd suggest limiting the number of house keys you have floating around to decrease the likelihood of a set becoming lost.", "ESH you have four keys out to various people that's a lot of emergency keys in circulation why?

Why are you so worked up about that??", "Given that she can't say if the key was lost or stolen, YES. Can she say with absolute certainty that somebody didn't pick up the key and follow her? No, she can't. Therefore, the missing key is a security risk.

With this level of effort that you are implying there are way easier ways to just rob a house. You are expecting a pickpocket to grab a key after scoping this apartment and knowing the sister had a key and then using it to break in. If they want to break in there are other ways. Especially if it's a first level apartment.", "If we look back at the OPs statement that it happened last week and they only got their locks changed yesterday, I think it's safe to assume that it would have been at least 3 days since sister reported the missing key. That means that the key COULD have been in possession of someone for 3 days and that person had 3 days to break in. Since the locks did get changed, I think it's safe to assume that the OPs lack of concern, in this instance, was justified considering nothing happened within those 3 days.", "You understand that just cause something happened to you doesn't make it likely right?", "stop projecting your past traumas", "Lame condescension", "Okay I\u2019m back.

Given her repsonce, I'm guessing there is something in her past that triggered her response.", "Yea, but she shouldn't put that fear on her boyfriend to that extent.
