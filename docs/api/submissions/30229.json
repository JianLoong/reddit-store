My brother married Liz about 11 years ago and they have four kids. Liz is not an easy person to get along with but people in my family try hard for the sake of my nephews who are the nicest kids ever. Liz and I really don't have much of a relationship and I'm cool with that.\n\nMy younger brother 22yo Dylan is currently living with me after he got out of jail and rehab. He had a very traumatic event and when people found out, he was bullied a lot. More than me when people figured out I was gay. I've gotten into plenty of dust ups protecting him and don't really give a fuck. Dylan is not some dangerous person. He's quite square and reminds me a lot of my nephews. \n\nI went to my 9yo nephew's birthday party last weekend and the topic of Thanksgiving came up. My brother suggested just doing it at our parent's house. Liz asked if Dylan was going to come. I thought how thoughtful of her to think of him. She knows he had some issues and was putting a genuine effort to getting his life back on the rails. He got a job at Subway, complying with his probation, taking treatment seriously and wants to go to college when he's done. His goal is to expunge his drug possession charge. Sure, he's been aloof in the past and now he welcomes support. He sorta of went underground over the shame and trauma of his past.\n\nI said I'm sure he'll come. Liz said she didn't want her kids around a felon. I said he's not a predator, thief or someone you can't trust Liz. Take it down a notch. She said but he's a felon and an addict and everyone knows. I said yes he is and you're a bitch and everyone knows.\nShe got mad and said do not talk to me that way. I said then watch your mouth. If you don't want him around your kids then that's your choice but don't act like you're perfect or important because you're not. \n\nMy brother jumped in and said don't talk to my wife like that. I said I'll talk to her or you however I want. I mean, we can go behind the parking lot if you like. My other SIL said it was time to separate. I said I'm good and I'm out. Bye Liz. See you at Thanksgiving.\n\nSix days later and it's Friday and my brother texted me. He said I scared his wife and he wanted me to apologize to her. I said but of course! After she apologizes acting like a stuck up bitch. He said she's not going to apologize to me. I said well then you can tell her that I said she can go fuck herself or you can come down here and make me apologize.\n\nIt's a shame because my brother and I used to be tight.\n\nUpdate: Now my brother said this isn't an episode of Jerry Springer and be serious.

You sound very hostile and you seem to have some serious anger issues.\n\nI don't think you should be around those kids either tbh.", "I applaud you standing up for your brother. The drug conviction and big business of jails and prisons is out of hand and I am sorry your brother got caught up in that.\n\nDamn, you don\u2019t hold back, do you. At least people know where you stand. I hope you have an excellent Thanksgiving, however it shakes out.\n\nAnd oooh, you \u201cscared\u201d your SIL for speaking frankly and defending your brother. Boo hoo for her. NTA", "I'm sorry to say that YTA here. I get that you were trying to protect your brother and certainly Liz's point of view is screwed up, BUT instead of having a reasoned argument with her about her stance you called her a bitch. Why would that ever be okay? What did you think you'd gain by insulting her? All it did was make you look like an asshole, thus you did neither yourself, nor your older brother nor Dylan a favour. Probably just destroyed the relationship.", "Nta", "YTA Your SIL didn\u2019t do anything wrong. She just said she didn\u2019t want her kids around a felon. I agree that your brother deserves a second change and it\u2019s great that he wants to try to better himself. Yet, it\u2019s also understandable that your SIL doesn\u2019t trust him enough to be around her kids (yet). She didn\u2019t say anything offensive or untrue. You seem to have serious anger issue calling your SIL names and wanting to fight your brother and all this at a children\u2019s party. You do owe them an apology.", "You took enough time to tell us, a group of strangers on the internet, why your younger brother\u2019s life went off the rails and how hard he\u2019s working to get it back. But instead of doing the same for your sister-in-law, whose life and children are directly impacted, you just immediately blew up and attacked her when she expressed concern. \n\nI know you have your differences, but you owe it to yourself, your SIL, your brothers, and your entire family to try to mend this fence, starting with an apology. \n\nRemember that by living with your younger brother and being his confidant, you see the path that he\u2019s on far more clearly than most. You really can\u2019t blame someone from outside that close dynamic for not understanding. Many people with pasts like your brother\u2019s do fall back into old patterns eventually, and that would be extra tough if her kids grew close to him. \n\nSo YTA. You took a situation where you should have been an empathetic ambassador, and turned it into a brawl. Everyone\u2019s going to feel like they have to take sides. Your younger brother will be embarrassed and probably go back into his shell. You will lose contact with your wonderful niblings. For what? Because you didn\u2019t like that she jumped to a very common conclusion? You can still set things right.", "NTA", "ESH", "ESH you aren't wrong, but you had the opportunity to take the high road and lost it. She was in the wrong and you could have left her there in the wrong until you called her names, and started with the dumb \"we can go behind the parking lot\" stuff. Grow up in that regard, all you did was come out the bad guy. \n\nLiz is still wrong and it's sucks your brother can't see that. You can apologize for losing your cool and talking like a 14 year old boy trying to look tough, but that you are disappointed in your brother for not defending your other brother who is trying very hard to right his wrongs.", "YTA\n\n\u201cGo behind the parking lot\u201d \u2026 \u201cCome down here & make me apologize\u201d \u2026 Lol! How old are you? \n\nLiz won\u2019t be the only person to have an opinion about your brother\u2019s past, incarceration & rehab. Perhaps you should take it down a notch & learn how to actually advocate for your brother. You\u2019re not helping him or protecting him with your attitude. \n\nDylan will just be the ex-con with a hot headed, asshole brother. If you can\u2019t handle the conversations about your brother or get control of your temper then just walk away.\n\neta", "NTA- I like when people actually don\u2019t beat around the bush and call out behavior. I do blame you all for letting her get away with it just because of the niblings. Keep helping your brother out so he can recover.", "INFO\n\nSo there's you, the brother that married Liz (calling him S), a third brother (you mentioned another SIL) lets call him H, and Dylan, is that right? And all 4 of you used to be tight but aren't now? \n\nDid Dylan and S have a falling out? I don't understand why S (or H for that matter) would be okay with Liz insulting their brother and putting him down.", "ESH - I get that you don't care for her and you were only standing up for your brother who it sounds like he is working hard to get his life back on track.  She sounds judgemental and unforgiving.  But the way you went about it wasn't the best way to do it.  We all say things in the heat of the moment that can't be unsaid.  There are better ways to defend your brother and support him.  Everyone here got heated and said things that shouldn't have been said.", "That's all good if she doesn't. I clearly agreed with her on that. But she's not perfect and apparently we don't agree on that. \n\nI didn't mention anything about a fight. We were at a bowling alley and I offered to take our disagreement outside away from the kids.", "How does one have a reasoned argument or debate with a person who is being unreasonable?", "I didn't say anything offensive or untrue", "In your opinion what would have been the best way to be an \"empathetic ambassador\"? Seeking to exclude someone in recovery from family events will probably force him back into his shell too.", "Agreed. Both parties escalated the situation needlessly.", "There were 8.\n\nMe, my two brothers, my two SILs, my parents and an uncle.", "Agreed, ESH. I commend you for sticking up for your brother, especially since it seems he's doing everything he can to overcome a bad choice. When they make a good faith effort, people can and do change, especially when they have positive support in their life. Liz sucks because she's letting her prejudices get in the way of her good sense. Having your brother around could be a great thing for the kids since there's a good chance they can learn from his mistakes and avoid making those mistakes themselves, later on in life. You suck because you went and are still going too hard. Just like Liz should apologize for being a bigot, you should apologize for insulting her. There's more and  less effective ways to make people aware of their weaknesses/flaws so they can work on them and the way you chose was probably the least effective way out there. You brother was right to step up and defend her. I only hope that in private he's also stepping up and defending your Dylan.", "You could have just said : okay, I guess we won't see you or the kids at Thanksgiving then.\n\nOr : well, my parents are hosting so you'll have to take this matter to them.\n\nYou didn't have to call her a bitch, in front of her kids...", "\"You're not wrong, but he's actively working to turn his life around (insert examples). He's living with me and I'm keeping my eye on him. He may have made some mistakes, but I'm not going to let him stumble into old habits, not while he's under my roof. \n\nDon't you think, it being Thanksgiving and all, that that would be the best time for us all to show Dylan how much we all support him. How we're all here to help and remind him that we're all in his corner and we ALL want him to get back up on his feet and get his life back on track? That we're so thankful he's still with us and we couldn't be more proud of the progress he's made?\n\nYou know, Liz, if you really feel like you can't trust him yet and don't want him around the boys that's your prerogative. But Thanksgiving is at my parents house this year. I'm sure you'd never think of telling one of your children that they couldn't come to Thanksgiving. It doesn't seem right to ask my parents to do that either.\"\n\nIf she still wanted to argue after that remind her that everyone is there for the birthday party and that wasn't the time or place to discuss uninviting the boy's uncle to Thanksgiving. \n\nBesides, the parents have the final say in who gets invited to Thanksgiving at THEIR house and Liz can stuff her own turkey if she doesn't like the guest list.", "The OP did a great job telling us about his brother\u2019s journey and why he trusts him here in this post. That\u2019s a perfect example of being a good advocate. \n\nHaving a tantrum at a bowling alley is not.", "My parents are hosting and they'll decide who they want to invit.", "Oh, so the other SIL you mentioned is Dylan's wife then? \n\nDo you know if Dylan and S ever had a falling out? I'm still a little confused why S wouldn't stand up for his brother.", "Or she shouldn't dish out what she can't take back.", "Yep, exactly. That's the kind of reasoned argument I was hinting it!", "It would have been nice if he had been this thoughtful but as someone from a marginalized community seeing someone else get marginalized himself set him off. And if Liz is anything like he says she is I think she'd still be looking for an apology even for this. Plus I don't think his brother is any better for allowing someone to talk about his brother like he is a monster.", "Would that have been enough her? I'm inclined to think it wouldn't be.  I don't get the sense that she is interested in understanding what he was gone through  to get clean and the work he has been doing to stay clean. She thinks he is a monster who needs to be sequestered from the the rest of the family. Her mind has been made up.", "Yes but that doesn't answer the question. Moreover, it does seem like he tried to de-escalate the situation at least by telling Liz to tone it down a notch, but she was insistent with her prejudices. Adding to that myself and others here in the thread wonder why the other brother present seemed passive in allowing his wife to continue to blow up.\n\nSure the OP clearly has work on his communication better but Liz is the one that badly needs to keep her thoughts to herself with what is obviously a delicate matter with the family -- it isn't something should readily express without sensitivity. \n\nESH and clearly there is a history here with not liking Liz that it just feels like this whole thing was finally the last straw given how she expressed herself, and her husband for being passive in all this.", "No, I have four brothers.", "OMG !! What are you ? 12 ?\n\nShe didn't insult anybody. She just said she was not confortable with her kids being around someone Who just got out of jail and hasn't been sober for very long. \n\nYou want to be taken seriously ? Act like an adult and not like a scary jerk.", "Okay, so 4 brothers, Dylan, S, H, and ... J. \n\nAt the birthday party there was yourself, S and H. Dylan and J weren't there.\n\nDo you know if Dylan and S ever had a falling out? Why would S not stand up for his brother.", "I didn't insult her either. Believe, there's plenty of material there.", "Calling someone a bitch is insulting someone."]}
