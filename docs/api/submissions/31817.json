We do everything together and have never had problems in our relationship thus far. \n\nMarc took me to meet his family for the first time ever two days ago. My period was a day or two late this month so I wasn't surprised when I started menstruating in the middle of playing with Marc's neices. I didn't think much of it and told Marc's mom (who was playing with the neices alongside me) that I needed to use the bathroom since I've gotten my period. I was not expecting to see disgust on her face. \n\nShe looked really panicked and disgusted when she stood up to lead me to the bathroom. The whole time, she kept telling me not to touch anything or anyone, and to maintain a safe distance from the food on the dinner table. It was bizzare to me but I kept my mouth shut until I could get a tampon inside me. \n\nWhen I came out, I noticed that Marc's mom seemed wary of me. I asked her if everything was okay and she said that everything was fine but that I couldn't touch certain things in the house, especially the items made out of cloth. This included the couch. I had to sit on a random wooden chair. I would not have minded if not for the context. \n\nThis whole situation made me extremely mad as she was treating me like I was impure and untouchable. The other women in the house did not say anything and the men pretended to not hear the commotion. I told Marc's mom clearly that I was not going to be following these rules and would much rather prefer to be out of the house. \n\nMarc had gone out to get ice creams for everyone so I did not get the chance to tell him before I stormed out and went back home by cab. He wasn't upset with me but he did say that I could've waited for him to come back even though it wasn't completely necessary. \n\nMy sister in law says it was kind of an asshole move to just up and leave.

For example, you might both be comfortable with a relationship where you can skip any occasion with his family and where you stay child-free. In that case there's no reason for this to end.\n\nI will say that the likelihood of his whole family changing how they act around this topic is slim, so whether you're happy to have a conditional relationship with your potential \"in laws\", it WOULD be actively irresponsible of you if you chose to have a child with this man if he's in contact with his family. These are attitudes its EXTREMELY DANGEROUS for a child of any gender to be exposed to.", "I mean not TA, cause she was being really extra about it and made it a bigger deal than it should have been, which I get made you uncomfortable since its your first time meeting these people and your being singled out and  treated like you're a child with cheeto fingers. I do think you could have handled a little better. If you wanted to continue a relationship with this guy it would probably be better to have waited for him and politely excuse yourself. Since obviously his mom is rather particular, she has probably already decided that she doesn't like you. Which is fine.

Why did he leave you at his parents' house when you were so new? Why didn't he warn you about his Mom's mental illness? Is she like this only around period blood?

You didn't know what their standards are around that. My family's standard is that we talk about it all the time. Seriously, it's all farts and periods in our house. We announce our poops. But my father's family origin was not like that. My grandparents never discussed this stuff. It was unmentionable. My grandmother died never telling anyone when she went into menopause or if the cancer that killed her was lung or breast cancer.
