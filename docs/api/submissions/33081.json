It sounds like this friendship has run its course (at least on his side). It sucks, but I think you should just let it go.", "Why? He just doesn\u2019t consider you a close friend, calling him out will do nothing", "He isn\u2019t a good friend. He doesn\u2019t care about you. Quit, (metaphorically), beating a dead horse and move on. \n\nYou can let this go without coming off as an asshole *by just letting it go*.  This was a friend from childhood and highs school. For whatever reason, he has moved on. Block him so you don\u2019t have to hear about his updates. NTA", "NTA if you keep your mouth shut and just unfriend him on social media. But do end the relationship and turn down the invitation. No drama, just let it die. This isn't someone who takes you seriously. Burn off your frustration by taking a long run, going a few rounds with the heavy bag or whatever else you do to feel better. I'm sorry that your friendship is this one-sided.", "I *guess* NTA but seriously, why even bother? It sounds like you weren\u2019t as close as you believed and he silently removed you as a friend. I really would just stop thinking about it completely and move on", " YWBTA.\n\nHe may have been one of your first friends, but he's not your best friend by a long shot.\n\nJust generally speaking, kids make friends with neighbors and classmates.  In high school you make some new friends who share your interests.  In college you make new friends as an adult, and these friends may have much more in common than the kid from down the block when you were growing up.  That's just how it is.\n\nMaking a stink about not being invited to his wedding might make you feel better, but all it will do from his perspective is cement the idea that you're too needy or no fun or whatever.\n\nYou're not invited.  Just lose his number and forget about him.", "NAH. I think you're fine to tell him how this makes you feel, but not to \"call him out\". He's not obligated to have you at his wedding.", ">How can I just let this go without coming off as an asshole?\n\nBy just letting this go.", "YWBTA he\u2019s shown you this friendship has run its course for him so to keep your dignity you need to quietly let it go. He just doesn\u2019t care. Sometimes people outgrow friendships.", "YTA if you think there is anything to be gained by \"calling him out.\" Sounds like it might have been a hardship financially for him to attend your wedding but he did make it and it wasn't cheap for him.  The fact that he didn't attend another wedding shortly thereafter may have been just a financial thing too.  Sounds like you are not good enough friends to know much about what his situation is.\n\nWho knows why he has not invited you to his wedding.  Maybe he is limited in the number of people he can invite and there are others he is closer too ahead of you.  Get over it.  Whatever, you NEVER call a friend out for not inviting you to their wedding, at least not if you value the friendship at all.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

The issue, tho, IMHO, is that you have rights and expectations in your heart that are not shared by others. You are holding grudges, taking offense, and likely jumping to conclusions. Is that who you want to be? From my perspective (and a lifetime of experience) true friendships don\u2019t trade in grudges and unforgiveness. Why can\u2019t you just lovingly call your friend, congratulate him, and tell him, friend to friend, you would like to attend his wedding if that is ok? Where you cross the line into being TAH is when you become butthurt, pushy and correcting. Don\u2019t be that person. Assume the best. Forgive when necessary. Be kind. Good luck; the history of this friendship makes one believe it is worth cultivating.", "If nothing else, you probably would justify his reasoning for not inviting you.", "Distance yourself! If he reaches out, you can let him know you were hurt about not being invited. The stuff in the past should've been dealt with then, don't bother bringing it up now.\n\nYWBTA if you, unprompted, \"called him out.\"", "NTA. What you\u2019re asking and looking for are two different things. You are asking for logic and explanation. What you\u2019re looking for is that validation he also respects you the way you did and cared. \n\nAs a compromise, I think you can approach this after the wedding takes place. But like others have said seems like the relationship has run its course and you\u2019re hurting. Sorry for that OP. Be well.", "He either doesn't like you or is a bad person you shouldn't be friends with.\n\nAre you close enough to reach out to his parents?", "NAH. You consider him to be a close friend. He clearly doesn\u2019t feel the same. He isn\u2019t an AH for not feeling close to you anymore (although RSVPing yes and no showing was an AH move). I don\u2019t think there is anything to be gained by telling him you are hurt.", "Ya, he sounds like a total ass but YWBTA. Everyone has the right to chose their guest list- and you have the right to let the friendship fade out.", "YWBTA, this friendship is over and its time to take the hint he not so gently has been pushing your way. You may be hurt but reaching will only cause new drama.", "Realistically, what do you think calling him out would do? You want him to spell out for you that he just doesn\u2019t want you there? I know this sucks to hear\u2026 but you probably weren\u2019t invited because he doesn\u2019t consider you as close a friend as you have considered him. And giving him grief about that isn\u2019t going to make you two any closer. Some friends are only friends for a season in our lives. \n\nHe seems pretty inconsiderate towards you and your other friend in general, so maybe it isn\u2019t such a loss to move on from this friendship.", "dude, that guy dropped the ball so fucking bad during your wedding and you want to attend his?. call him out all you want but that won't fix your wedding and probable he'll get defensive about it.\n\nNTA but maybe, just cut off and move on?", "YTA. He\u2019s not obligated to invite you to his wedding. His wedding isn\u2019t about YOU. You don\u2019t know his circumstances, decision making, etc, and don\u2019t have a say here. Choose to stay friends with him or not based on this, but don\u2019t send a message making his wedding about you.", "Sounds like this friendship has reached its \"sell by\" date. Just accept it and move on, because it seems he moved on some time ago.", "Thanks for the comment.  He attending a different wedding instead of my friends which already required travel to a remote destination instead of my friends which was in our hometown.  Also, he's a doctor and they have no kids.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"Get over it\" - great advice, thanks", "This response sounds sarcastic, but literally the best advice you will be given is \"get over it.\" \n\nSo, it's not financial. Sounds like the guy simply doesn't care about you much anymore, which hurts, but calling him out won't matter to him because he does not care about you. You can't make him care about you. The friendship has run its course."]}
