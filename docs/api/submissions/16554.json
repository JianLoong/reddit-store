She was and still is the best student in her class, and very supportive of her peers.

I was heartbroken but none the less, I decided to return her car as i had brought it recently. When I came back home, my daughter asked me where the car went. I told  Hailey I returned the car and that I didn\u2019t have it anymore. Hailey asked me if me and her can go to the car dealership to pick out her new car and I told her no. She asked why and I said it was because of her reaction to the car, and that she acted very spoiled and that wasn\u2019t how I taught her to act. I always told her to be grateful for the things that she has, and that because of her reaction, I wouldn\u2019t get her anything as she ruined the reward. She told me it wasn\u2019t fair, and that I could get her a new one easily. I told her i was disappointed in her.

I had to learn manual to be able to drive it (fun times for a 16-year-old girl who was also learning to drive period), but that was the car I wanted and I let my parents know when I was like 14 and we waited until we found a solution that worked for everyone.\n\nSo, OP is an A H for not involving the daughter in the choice/providing a useful lesson in budgeting, and daughter is THE A H for acting spoiled.

(My vote is ESH for the record, but you more than her).\n\nGetting her a car wasn't just a \"gift\". Sure it is to be *gifted to* her, but it is nowhere near the same league as, say, electronics or art. This is not something she can choose not to hang on her wall if she doesn't like it, or not use if it doesn't work for her. This is a car, a utility/tool absolutely crucial in most people's every day life. And sure while there may be alternatives, they are far far less effective and much more time consuming than someone owning their own car. \n\nAll that to say, this is a HUGE investment in her future. This is something she will likely use every day for hours on end, for her studies and/or her work. She will have to take care of for years, show and help her friends with, shoulder the expenses for, and be ultimately responsible for. And what happened was, someone else made the choice for her on what that tool and environment should be for her, without so much as her input.\n\nWhat you did, though noble your intentions were, was treat a car like every other gift. The whole way you went about it, albeit definitely generous, is essentially wrong on 3 counts: 1) as I explained above, this is much more of a tool than a gift, 2) given this will be something *she will be using* primarily and excessively, her input should be strongly adhered to (within reason) (think of it as a pet, you may be the one buying but it is overwhelmingly *not* for you but for someone else to live with every day) and 3) this wasn't for a one-off celebration like, say, her birthday. You said yourself she has always been an exemplary student, kind and supportive, so this was as you said \"a reward for (years and years, I imagine, of) all her hard work and effort\". And you take it back, basically nullifying *years* of good behavior and grades, because of a semi-justified overreaction? What is the lesson here? \"Try your best for years on end, but one misstep and it all counts for nothing\"? I don't think this is remotely fair, do you?\n\nI was one of those people whose parent bough them a car for my perfect attendance, grades, and general kindness. It was something I had discussed it with my mother, told her I need something small, fast, and easy to fix (because parking near my Uni was hell). She got me a Mercedes sedan, because it was what *she* would like. It was a champagne color, because she liked the color. It was way longer than I felt comfortable with, way more expensive than I could maintain, and way more troublesome to cover my every day needs with. Part of me was grateful for it, but the majority of me hated the car.\n\nWhat I did, which I am not defending as a better course of action but I welcome you to think about, is accepted the car, and when everything was transferred over to me, immediately turned around and sold it. Used the proceeds to buy a car much more suitable to my life and needs, and also made some profit. My mother was deeply insulted though, and never forgave me for it, saying I \"disrespected her gift, her sacrifice, her gratefulness etc\". I ask you, would you have preferred this to have happened with your daughter, or would you have been just as hurt and betrayed as my mother felt?\n\nYour daughter is the asshole for how she reacted, but I sympathize with her greatly since, by your words, you didn't paint her at all as a spoiled brat, which makes her reaction a panicked one and not an entitled one. She likely saw years of her life ahead of her, tied to a car she didn't like - her reaction isn't the best for a 17-year old, but it is also definitely not unwarranted. What would your honest response have been if she had expressed the exact same sentiment, but more respectfully? \n\nIn my opinion, you are the bigger asshole because this is such a HUGE impactful tool in her life, and you didn't take her desires in any way into consideration. Please have a discussion with her, apologize to her, ask her to apologize to you for her behavior, and then together find something you will both be comfortable with.", "You may be NTA but there's more going on here than a car. If your wife is pissed and your daughter is pissed and they're both not talking to you, there's something going on here that you don't understand and you should figure out ASAP.\n\nIs this a common thing that happens a lot?

Why shouldn't a car purchase be collaborative? \n\nPersonally I think buying a car should be done with the main drivers input.\n\nNot all cars are the same, and neither are people. You want to make sure you're comfortable in the car, that it \"fits\" you as it were, that you can handle it etc.\n\nThis is really has nothing to do with being \"lucky to have a parent buying it\".", "How did that surprise work out?", "So N T A I think, but if the car was for her why wasn\u2019t getting to help pick out her own first car part of the surprise? Like it could have been an amazing memory for the two of you (or 3 including mom) and instead you got to pick everything for her. \n\nI agree she should\u2019ve been grateful for what you got her but maybe consider sitting down having a discussion about all of this and then seeing if you can come to an understanding. Then in a few months when everyone has had time you can get her the reward for all the things she\u2019s still doing despite her mistaken child reaction. It\u2019s a good opportunity from growth and understanding and an adult conversation for all of you.", "You are a spoiled and we're lucky to get anything. \"Wouldn't drive a car you didn't get to pick\" if your parents say they want to buy you a car you go, \"thank you\" and that's it. Entitlement makes me sick", "Whilst I don't fully disagree at which point are you allowed to not care about the recipient's opinion?\n\nDriver can't drive manual? Well they're just being entitled and should learn to drive manual. Driver lives in or is moving to a city? Well they should be grateful they got a car at all rather than throwing up a fuss over a massive truck that's completely impractical.\n\nCars are something that most people will drive for years. Many people will test drive multiple cars before selecting one. \n\nPersonally, I try to give gifts that I know the person will like or at least them an option to return it if I got it wrong. I don't think they're being entitled if they do that. Why should cars being treated differently? Because they're so expensive? Wouldn't that just make it more important to make sure it's a good fit?\n\nNow say, if I say bought a small piece of jewellery that's in their style and they asked me to return it and get one that's 10x the price, that's different.

You decide to give her a major gift that she deserves according to you and she will use. A gift costing quit a bit of money. Why not just enjoy choosing this gift together.
