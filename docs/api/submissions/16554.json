She was and still is the best student in her class, and very supportive of her peers. My daughter was doing extraordinarily in school, on top of her class work, and was one of the best students of her school. I decided to get her a gift for all her hard work and effort. We will call my daughter Hailey, and I decided to get her a car as a gift for her hard work and effort. I got her a 2020 BMW as a reward. When I showed it to her and let her ride it, she was livid, because for some reason it was ugly, not the newest, and she said she wouldn\u2019t touch it. I was heartbroken but none the less, I decided to return her car as i had brought it recently. When I came back home, my daughter asked me where the car went. I told  Hailey I returned the car and that I didn\u2019t have it anymore. Hailey asked me if me and her can go to the car dealership to pick out her new car and I told her no. She asked why and I said it was because of her reaction to the car, and that she acted very spoiled and that wasn\u2019t how I taught her to act. I always told her to be grateful for the things that she has, and that because of her reaction, I wouldn\u2019t get her anything as she ruined the reward. She told me it wasn\u2019t fair, and that I could get her a new one easily. I told her i was disappointed in her. She told her mom and she told me that I was being mean and that i should just get her the car she wanted, but I stood my ground.

When I got a new (used) car  my only requirement was that it had to be from this millennium", "I would have been thrilled if my parents had bought me any car! Instead I only got to borrow my mom\u2019s Mazda 323 on the days I worked at the grocery store after school.", "She's not going to outgrow it. She was raised this way. Why else would she act like such a brat?", "I had a Ford Focus in the mid 2000s and it was the absolute dogs bollocks.\n\nWas the Ghia version so went like shit off a shovel.\n\nBrilliant, brilliant cars.", "You know what, I'm starting to sort of lean to this too.", "Yeah i agree, it's a weird one.\n\nIf she raised not to be spoilt, why would she know a 2020 model from a 2023 one then act all pissy about not getting the newest one... You don't suddenly have that behaviour. \n\nI also think ESH because as nice as cars are as surprise gifts... I think the person driving it should have *some* say in the car they're getting, whether they're a spoilt diva or not. \n\nBut saying that", "I agree. I told my parents I wanted a VW Beetle, and since we all knew a brand new one wasn't on the table for our budget (but we lived in a rural area, so everyone in my family pretty much needed their own car for transportation. Regular errands were often a half hour drive one-way, as was my high school), we kept our eyes on the local used lots until one came up for sale, at about half the cost of a brand new one. I had to learn manual to be able to drive it (fun times for a 16-year-old girl who was also learning to drive period), but that was the car I wanted and I let my parents know when I was like 14 and we waited until we found a solution that worked for everyone.\n\nSo, OP is an A H for not involving the daughter in the choice/providing a useful lesson in budgeting, and daughter is THE A H for acting spoiled. The nail in the daughter's coffin for me was when she asked if she could go pick out a car once the first one was returned after acting the way she did about a very expensive gift. Everyone saying she was never owed a car is correct.", "Yeah her opinion should have been considered.  \n\nA Toyota or Honda is cheaper to maintain than a BMW. I agree.\n\nMy dad did something similar when I was  a teen. The 2 brands I knew I could afford parts of and fix myself was ignored for something to expensive for me to repair. The parts were 10 times as expeand nearly impossible to track down. \n\nHe got a totally different classic car. Then was mad a decade later when I got rid of it since it was too expensive to fix. If it would've been one of 2 I told him I wanted I'd still have it 30 years later. He still sees me as the jerk though.", ">Another point is that her feelings may be hurt because she may have talked about the kind of car she'd like in that past and you getting her one she doesn't like may make her feel like you don't listen to her or care about her. \n\nThis is a great point! I feel like there has to be some \"missing reasons\" here that OP is glossing over, and this is a great example of what those missing reasons could be (or it could be something else, like maybe he won't let her apply to the colleges she wants to go to). OP bought his teenager a BMW and so he kinda has to be an asshole, and moreover he's acting like an asshole in comments, so the most likely situation here is he's hiding why he's the asshole from us and we'd get a very different story from eveyone else involved here.", "This is the first time", "I\u2019ll bet he has had other opportunities to teach this lesson.  This one just stung more bc of the cost", "At 17, I would have been grateful for a beaten up car older than me, as long as it still runs. If she doesn't like the car, she can just turn it down", "Someone said YTA, am i though", "Create what exactly?", "Haha love that! And yep British!", "Heifers \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "So not the AH.  Your wife also needs a reality check.  Your daughter needs to know that kindness should be met with kindness.  Being a brat gets you bus pass and not a bmw.", "Don't show it to your daughter they'll just make things worse, but do show it to your wife.", "Sorry but she never told me cause she never thought i would get her one myself.", "Solid point", "Yeah, but maybe (like me!) you didn\u2019t have parents who could afford 2020 BMWs. My first car was an old beaten-up 1967 Volvo (this was in the 90s), but my parents actually let me find my own car (under a certain $ amount) and I loved it and was super grateful. If my parents had somehow found the money to buy me a brand new red Porsche without my input, I would have been repulsed, not grateful.", "Nope, not at all.", "No, not at all. You bought her a car that most people could never afford as a working adult, let alone as a 17 year old. This was an incredible gift, whether it was \"ugly\" or not. \n\nShe threw it back in your face and for that deserves nothing. Stand your ground, she will hopefully learn", "Uh, a spoiled child. Thought that was obvious.", "Long live the King!", "Right like they still think I\u2019m being dickish cause i didn\u2019t ask, it would\u2019ve ruined the surprise", "Then that's on you. You should have asked. You should have included her.", "Fair enough. Some of us didn't have the luxury of being repulsed with getting a car that's all.", "Thanks", "Seriously? I feel for you, man. That's absolutely fucked.", "It wasn\u2019t your daughters car it was yours, you were going to give it to her and she turned her nose up at it because it wasn\u2019t pretty. Sorry the phrase don\u2019t look a gift horse in the mouth applies here.  She wasn\u2019t owed a car, she didn\u2019t contribute to it and by acting like a spoiled petulant child she obviously doesn\u2019t deserve it either.\n\nAs for your wife ask her how she\u2019d feel if she\u2019d bought you something from the bottom of her heart and you stated it was ugly?", "Well she talked her way into a surprise!  but seriously, it was a gift and when is it ever appropriate to react to a gift in a manner that she did?  She was embarrassing.", "Mate, if my parents had of bought me the crappiest shitbox on the planet I would have almost shed a tear from joy. Your daughters response is just insane to me.", "N.P.", "I got my licence in 2011 and until 2017, shared a car with my mum before buying my own car. I even paid for all the fuel and fully the insurance and car service, etc and muk didn't pay a penny. I thought that was generous of them for letting me drive the car.\n\nSome kids are just way too spoilt."]}
