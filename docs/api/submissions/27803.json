Asking this first because I think it is valuable to have some attachment to your nephew since you all live together.

The walks could be a decent way to spend time getting used to each other in a way that doesn\u2019t feel overwhelming. \n\nNTA- I think it\u2019s reasonable to not feel a strong desire to hold the baby right away, especially since he\u2019s not your kid. Touch is very sensory and if you aren\u2019t a parent who spends a lot of time holding the baby it can be extremely hard to develop a touch attachment that feels good. Your family suggesting something is wrong with you for not wanting to hold and play with the baby is unfair. This is a new person, you\u2019ll bond in your own way if you choose to engage.

We didn't push him though because we could see that he loved him in his own way. Not by holding or cuddling him but by asking: does he eat enough, is he cold etc. They grew a bond of their own: he might not be the uncle who tickles him, but you bet he will build the lego set with him.\n\nIt's okay to have your own version of a bond with your nephew. But your post makes it seem like you don't care one bit for him, in a \"don't care if the kid lives or dies\" kind of way. And that is for sure not \"the norm\". I get where your mom is coming from because I would be worried about your mental health too. And as a sister I would be mortified, so I for sure wouldn't push my baby onto you.

I'm autistic and I get the 'not feeling emotionally attached' in the same way as others might, but kids are humans and some of the most vulnerable humans in our society. They deserve love and affection and attention. You'll find your own way to bond as he gets older, but right now it sounds like you aren't even interested in trying, which is a little cruel IMO. You can't change what you feel but you CAN change how you outwardly treat this innocent, vulnerable child who will grow to love you and has done nothing wrong. \n\nAlso, it would help your sister to have an extra person to hold the baby -- do you love your sister?

But surprisingly enough, they love me.  Baffle me.  Your family does not have the right to tell you it's \"unhealthy\" to not like them.

I get that you don't like kids and they're pushing it on you, but it won't kill you to hold him for pictures every once in awhile. They're not asking you to babysit, they're asking you to participate in a giant life event they're excited about. The putting him next to you while you're sleeping is not as dangerous as others say, because they are literally right there if something happened and they didn't leave him there, it was just briefly for pictures. Sometimes in life we have to do things that are uncomfortable, and holding him for a minute so they can get pictures is a very short, mild annoyance you could deal with. If they continue pushing for anything beyond that then I'd say you have more of an issue worth being pissed off at them for. I hope you continue to get your diagnosis and wish you best.", "NTA\n\nIt seems to me that you have a very healthy relationship with your nephew. You don\u2019t want to be close to him, but you are ok with him being at the dinner table and around the house. These are completely reasonable expectations. It would be very strange if you expected your sister to keep her son away from you in normal and regular activities (there have been posts about that on this thread, so it does happen), and it would be wrong if you were actively rude to the baby. But what you are doing is not interacting with him, which is perfectly within your rights.\n\nJust know that it is very common to not feel attachment to a baby at first (even parents can feel this way with a newborn!).

No way!\n\nBut, I think you need a gameplan here, because if you're living with your nephew, he won't stay a baby. He's going to be a toddler who will be in your face and climbing all over you and pulling at your limbs for your attentiona nd talking non-stop and making a mess, and I think that's going to be very tough for you.

Not everyone likes babies/kids, and that\u2019s ok. It\u2019s also not ok for your sister to force interactions between you and your nephew. \n\nIt\u2019s also okay to not feel much for your nephew yet, babies at that age are just kind of little potatoes who just sleep, eat, cry, and poop. It\u2019s common for a lot of parents take time to feel love for their own babies, it\u2019s even more normal for extended family to take a while to feel anything for the new baby too. As he gets older (I\u2019m talking *years* older), develops a personality, can talk, and begins to be less messy who knows? You might feel better about being around him and even establish some sort of a relationship. Your sister just needs to *back off* and let things happen naturally instead of trying to force it. \n\nJust a small word of advice: while it\u2019s ok to not want to be around babies/kids, I would definitely encourage you to just make sure you can be kind and respectful to the kids/babies that you do meet. You don\u2019t need to play with them or go out of your way to interact with them, just don\u2019t be mean to them for no reason or ignore them if they talk to you.

Once he\u2019s mobile and he inevitably attempts to do something dangerous, you needs to be comfortable grabbing that kid. Ya ya, technically he\u2019s not your kid and not your responsibility but shit happens\u2026 could you imagine if the kid electrocuted himself and you just watched it happen because you were afraid to physically stop him because that required touching him? Your family would NEVER forgive you.\n\nMore commonly, there are going to be moments where baby needs to be moved from point a to point b, or simply held for a second while mom puts on her jacket, etc. Realistically speaking, you should bend a little and be ok with touching the baby for a few seconds, only because of the fact that you live with it and total avoidance isn\u2019t really practical.", "INFO  \n\nAre you doing anything to work on your aversion?

He\u2019s a new person you have only just met, and you haven\u2019t built up a personal relationship yet. \n\nKey word: yet. \n\nWhile lots of people (me included) just generically like all babies because they find them *cute & snuggly & smell awesome* (etc etc etc) - there are a LOT of actual parents who don\u2019t bond with their babies immediately. And then those poor new mums feel intense guilt because \u201csociety says I must love my baby immediately\u201d. It just doesn\u2019t always work like that. Dads often get a bit more of a pass - it\u2019s considered a little bit more normal for them \u201cnot to feel strongly connected\u201d until the child starts acting more like a tiny human rather than a potato. (Don\u2019t tell your sister or mum that lots of us refer to [The potato stage of new babies](https://reddit.com/r/beyondthebump/s/8ETmGqk5hW) - they won\u2019t find it amusing :-)\n\nBut in the same way that you might identify a new person you\u2019ve met as having potential for being someone you\u2019d like to get to know better (maybe to share a common interest), and then you would invest some time and effort into getting to know them better - it is appropriate to apply that same process to new babies in your immediate family. Assume the common interest is: \u201cwe are closely related\u201d. \n\nAs always, your mum & sister will be making this process harder by trying to accelerate it too fast. But if they see you making an effort to get to know him, and show an interest in his growth, then they might be willing to back off & let you do it at your own speed. \n\nBecause at this stage, it\u2019s actually really more about your relationship with your sister than your relationship with her baby. She wants to feel like your support her in this new stage of her life. \n\nFor example - if your sister is posting ridiculous amounts of \u201ccute\u201d baby photos daily, maybe set yourself a target to react to one photo a day. \n\nYou could maybe have fun with the criteria you use - setup a random number generator that converts to a time (limited to your typical awake hours or maybe 10am to 10pm) and then you like or comment on the first photo you see after that time occurs each day - so it appears random. (Maybe have a second random number generator to select \u201clike\u201d or \u201ccomment\u201d or \u201cskip today\u201d :-)\n\nOr pick a theme for each day of the week - maybe \n\n- Mondays you comment on what he\u2019s doing (\u201cbet he enjoyed that walk to the park\u201d) so you comment on the first picture that has an activity in it. \n\n- Tuesdays you just do a \u201creact\u201d icon on one photo. \n\n- Wednesdays you comment on how a photo is \u201cframed\u201d (\u201cthat\u2019s a nice photo, I like how you\u2019ve caught him looking at the dog being silly\u201d). \n\n- Thursdays you get to skip (no need to do it daily).  Etc. \n\nAs baby gets older you can ramp this effort down.
