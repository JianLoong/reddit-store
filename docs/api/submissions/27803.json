This is exactly how I feel about children. This reddit has now started a 30 minute argument between my partner and I because he thinks I\u2019m insane for being grossed out by babies and thinking there\u2019s nothing wrong with you. Don\u2019t worry, he is the insane one. Theres nothing wrong with you, kids under 8 are seriously gross.", "INFO- how you do you feel about the stroller/ dog walks. Asking this first because I think it is valuable to have some attachment to your nephew since you all live together. I think trying to avoid all interaction is just going to cause misery and resentment amongst all parties in the house and is also just realistic. The walks could be a decent way to spend time getting used to each other in a way that doesn\u2019t feel overwhelming. \n\nNTA- I think it\u2019s reasonable to not feel a strong desire to hold the baby right away, especially since he\u2019s not your kid. Touch is very sensory and if you aren\u2019t a parent who spends a lot of time holding the baby it can be extremely hard to develop a touch attachment that feels good. Your family suggesting something is wrong with you for not wanting to hold and play with the baby is unfair. This is a new person, you\u2019ll bond in your own way if you choose to engage. Touch doesn\u2019t have to be the only way you express affection or engage, but you will have to interact with your nephew if you all live together.", "Nta you definitely shouldn't have to touch or hold him, he's not your kid!  But you are going to have to figure out a way to be around him.", "NTA. I never understand why people would want someone who is clearly averse to holding a child to hold that child. Taking pictures of you while you're asleep with the baby next to you is kinda creepy to me.", "NTA\n\nYour mother and sister are the ones crossing boundaries here.  Maybe they need to talk to their psychiatrist as to why they think they need to force you to hold a child you clearly are uncomfortable spending time with.\n\nWill you be in a position to move out soon?  When do you finish school?  You're caught between a bit of a rock and a hard place because I can't see your mother and sister backing down here because it's your mothers house..  They are very much in the wrong but they will push it.", "NTA. You're not comfortable holding a child. Don't. Therapy might be helpful, but absolutely NOT for the reason your mom said- but to better understand yourself.   \n\n\nThis is ***not*** evidence you are wrong or flawed in ***any*** way. Just different.", "NTA, you are your own person. You don\u2019t like kids? So be it. No is an answer on its own.", "NTA. And I\u2019ll put some good money down that she\u2019s trying to get you to bond with her child so you\u2019ll babysit.", "\\>> She even recently put him next to me in my bed while I was sleeping, and was taking pictures of it.\n\nNTA she is being creepy.  It is not appropriate to take pictures without consent.", "Sof yta. My brother is the same as you: probably autistic and was scared of holding my baby. He just didn't know what to do with a baby. We didn't push him though because we could see that he loved him in his own way. Not by holding or cuddling him but by asking: does he eat enough, is he cold etc. They grew a bond of their own: he might not be the uncle who tickles him, but you bet he will build the lego set with him.\n\nIt's okay to have your own version of a bond with your nephew. But your post makes it seem like you don't care one bit for him, in a \"don't care if the kid lives or dies\" kind of way. And that is for sure not \"the norm\". I get where your mom is coming from because I would be worried about your mental health too. And as a sister I would be mortified, so I for sure wouldn't push my baby onto you. She is the A H for that", "YTA, a lil bit. I'm autistic and I get the 'not feeling emotionally attached' in the same way as others might, but kids are humans and some of the most vulnerable humans in our society. They deserve love and affection and attention. You'll find your own way to bond as he gets older, but right now it sounds like you aren't even interested in trying, which is a little cruel IMO. You can't change what you feel but you CAN change how you outwardly treat this innocent, vulnerable child who will grow to love you and has done nothing wrong. \n\nAlso, it would help your sister to have an extra person to hold the baby -- do you love your sister? Has she done anything for you in the past? Is it something you can reframe that way?", "YTA. Super strange behavior. It is not even close to normal to have the feelings you have about kids, especially kids within your close family.  \n\nReddit hates kids through so you will probably get mostly N T A responses.", "Not sure if it\u2019s unhealthy but what exactly is your plan? You\u2019re all living in the same house. To avoid future conflict y\u2019all are going to need to figure out a plan. How are you going to deal with this baby? Are you planning on moving out? \n\nYour sister & Mom need to listen & relax. You\u2019re not causing any problems. You just don\u2019t like babies.\n\nESH", "YTA that\u2019s your nephew.

You said no to holding or touching the infant yet she  invades your space while asleep for pics that will probably be social media posts.   That is gross", "NTA.  I myself do not like kids.  At all.  But surprisingly enough, they love me.  Baffle me.  Your family does not have the right to tell you it's \"unhealthy\" to not like them.  You have to ultimately decide if family harmony is worth your aversion to kids.  Me, I'm a stubborn bastard so I'd go nope.  And if you push, you won't see me anymore.", "NTA - I\u2019m exactly the same and object to having children forced on me. When they are older and can communicate I am a little more tolerant but forcing a child on you is unnecessary. Some people just aren\u2019t child friendly and there is nothing wrong with that!", "Going against the grain to say ESH. I get that you don't like kids and they're pushing it on you, but it won't kill you to hold him for pictures every once in awhile. They're not asking you to babysit, they're asking you to participate in a giant life event they're excited about. The putting him next to you while you're sleeping is not as dangerous as others say, because they are literally right there if something happened and they didn't leave him there, it was just briefly for pictures. Sometimes in life we have to do things that are uncomfortable, and holding him for a minute so they can get pictures is a very short, mild annoyance you could deal with. If they continue pushing for anything beyond that then I'd say you have more of an issue worth being pissed off at them for. I hope you continue to get your diagnosis and wish you best.", "NTA\n\nIt seems to me that you have a very healthy relationship with your nephew. You don\u2019t want to be close to him, but you are ok with him being at the dinner table and around the house. These are completely reasonable expectations. It would be very strange if you expected your sister to keep her son away from you in normal and regular activities (there have been posts about that on this thread, so it does happen), and it would be wrong if you were actively rude to the baby. But what you are doing is not interacting with him, which is perfectly within your rights.\n\nJust know that it is very common to not feel attachment to a baby at first (even parents can feel this way with a newborn!). Some people start feeling closer to babies after a while, some don\u2019t. As long as it\u2019s not your baby who you are keeping away from you, you are ok.", "NTA\n\nYour mother suggested therapy because you don't like kids???\n\nWow!  Therapists need to tap into that ASAP.  They would have a never-ending supply of new patients.", "NTA\n\nIt's totally up to you if you want to be around your nephew or not. If they had a dog and you were scared or dogs, would they force you to pet it? No, of course not! Just because it's human, you're supposed to be cooing over it? No way!\n\nBut, I think you need a gameplan here, because if you're living with your nephew, he won't stay a baby. He's going to be a toddler who will be in your face and climbing all over you and pulling at your limbs for your attentiona nd talking non-stop and making a mess, and I think that's going to be very tough for you. So unless your sister plans to move out, I'm afraid you'll be wanting to make plans to move out over the next couple of months.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"and my mom told me I had to go to a psychiatrist to talk about it, because \"Not wanting to touch or be around your nephew is unhealthy.\"\" you are fine.
