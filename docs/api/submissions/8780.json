Some of it may have involved some girl(?), and there were a lot of accusations being thrown around. He moved out at 18, when my sister and I were 4 and 8. He cut contact with us. Since everyone stopped talking about him a few years later, I figured it was the same for them, but one of my aunts was keeping tabs on him. I guess as time went on, the older relatives softened. For a few years now, they've all been wanting to reconcile things with Alex. \n\nIt's been slow going, but within the two years, he's shown interest in coming out for a visit. It hasn't worked out with holdidays, so now everyone really wants me to invite Alex to my wedding as a show of reconciliation to invite him back to the family and so he can see everyone. \n\nI don't want to. I don't even know this guy, and I don't want my wedding to turn into some prodigal son family reunion. My family says I can't possibly know what was happening back then, and they've changed their story to everything just being personality differences and normal teenage behavior that was getting blown out of proportion on both sides because he was the oldest son and the family was very traditional. \n\nEveryone is begging me to do it. My family was even offering to pay the cost to have him and his wife there, even though they aren't thrilled about his wife, but now they're upping it to paying half of the catering cost if he's included.

You don\u2019t have a relationship with your brother as of now. But I think YWBTA if you resisted having one just because your family is pressuring you to invite him. See if you can meet beforehand, because your own wedding is a really bad moment to see him for the first time, as you say. Insist on that.", "NTA.

You don't have to get angry about this, but you don't have to go along with it either. The wedding is supposed to be about you and your husband.

It\u2019s like they are using the wedding to make up for their past problems but understandably you are unhappy having someone there who is a stranger to you and potentially dealing with tension between family members. A reunion and reconciliation should be a separate event from the wedding, it\u2019s putting too much pressure on a day that is supposed to be happy and focused on you and your partner. If you can meet your brother before the wedding and want him there after getting to know him then that\u2019s up to you but you shouldn\u2019t be pressured by family members who didn\u2019t help you get to know him sooner.

Do NOT allow your wedding to become overshadowed by some random family politics that directly impact your day - there was stuff that went on at our wedding, but it wasn't anything we had to deal with directly and only heard about later so it didn't matter to our day.

You're on this forum, so you've probably read a bunch of stories where the child was treated poorly and went NC.  There is likely another side of the story and it sounds like others in your family are coming to that conclusion.  You don't need to invite anyone you don't want to, but there are going to be a number of people at your wedding you barely know (like your fianc\u00e9e family).  It wouldn't hurt to invite your brother.

Offer to host the return of the first born NOW, and make it about you and he meeting and getting to know each other.  What makes you think the first time he comes back into the fold that HE wants it to be at this high stress, very risky venue?  It seems your family wants your wedding to be about drama, not the beginning of the rest of your life as a couple.  Take the meaning of your wedding back by making contact as soon as possible.

You don't know what went down and how anyone is going to react if he does show up.", "NTA.  OMG!  NOOOOOOO!!  Do not let your family hijack your wedding and turn into a drama scene with the long lost black sheep of the family brother.  It's great if the family wants to reconnect and that can be done WITHOUT a wedding in the middle of it.  A long weekend or a dinner or whatever makes much more sense.  A wedding is NOT the time or place and it is not worth the monetary discount (and it really sucks that your family seems to think this is okay)", "NTA\n\n I believe your reservations are warranted.

It's really sucky for them to try and guilt you into it, and then trying to buy you. It's your wedding, it really is ok for the one day to be about you, your partner and your love. Trying to shoehorn in this other thing is just a scummy thing to do.", "NTA. If your relatives want to see Alex, they can do it another time. You do not need to invite a stranger to your wedding. Have your parents had contact with Alex? Do they want to? Does he want to see them? There is a lot of potential for awkwardness and drama you do not need on your wedding day. Has Alex even professed interest in coming? Has he asked the relatives he is in touch with about you? He must realize you are an adult now. Has he expressed any desire to see you? Asked a relative to give you his contact info or pass along a message?\n\nIt sounds like your relatives want this big movie moment of reconciliation that Alex himself might not even be interested in. Being in touch with relatives and being part of family events are not the same thing!", "NTA - they basically want to use the excuse of your wedding to try to reconcile with someone who is a stranger to you and has himself shown no urge to come back to his family. Invite him if you're curious and want to and it doesn't keep someone from coming who you care about. He will likely say no, he's stayed away this long. You have no obligation to other people's desires to invite him.", "Your wedding is about you and wife NOT family reconciliation/family reunion.  It is so rude for everyone to browbeat you about this.  NTA. Dont let your family hijack your wedding.  Your resentment will last far longer than their desire to meet this person again", "NTA. That\u2019s not the place for a reunion like this.", "NTA.  Your wedding is NOT the place to have a family reconciliation.  The family willing to pay his/his wife's expenses need to set up a family reunion party separate from your day.  Stand firm.  Do not bend your boundaries.  Don't give in to manipulations.", "Don't do it!!!!!!!! This isn't the time or place; a family member should throw a party and have him there. NTA", "NTA. Major personal events are not an appropriate venue for an estranged family member to reenter the family. That's what run of the mill family gatherings or like Thanksgiving is for.", "NTA It's your wedding and your day to spend how you like. If they want a reunion so badly, they can plan their own event and foot the bill then. Don't make your day about someone you don't even know. And shame on your extended family for trying to force this on you.", "NTA! A wedding is NOT the place for this kind of thing. The relatives that are offering $ can host a family reunion", "NAH", "If family wants to see him, they could go out for coffee, or diner, or invite him over or literally anything other than hijacking another person's event. NTA.", "Weddings are about the two people getting married. A long estranged family member is guaranteed to take attention away from them.\n\nThere's also that a wedding is the worst place for family drama because it also risks overshadowing the intended focus of the event. Factor in no one can keep their story straight about why he was estranged, and it's a big risk.", "Ask him the truth about what happened if he's comfortable sharing. Don't force it, don't get accusatory, and don't get angry. If the family has changed their story so many times, you deserve to have the record set straight so YOU can decide whether or not to pursue a relationship with him.", "Get security for the wedding, a family member may  bring him as a plus 1.", "Which is to say that no one will see it coming until the moment they all blow up at once.\n\nThat doesn't need to happen at your wedding. NTA.", "That's all the more reason not to have your wedding as the reunion. Talking, and indeed seeing him, will stir up memories, memories which may not be entirely positive. A wedding is the last place you want this to happen.", "I bet he remembers.", "But your brother probably does, what if in person, with all the family, old rancor and bitterness show up. It'll ruin your wedding!", "This. Its clear something went down, and you do have the right to know, BUT THAT SHOULDN\u2019T HAPPEN ON THE WEDDING DAY.", "NTA. This wedding is no place to sort out family drama..Basically, you don't even know him. At some point you might want together him for lunch and find out what kind of guy he is but not at your weding.", "So, to get it out of the way, your wedding, your say, so NTA whatever you choose. That being said...\n\n\"I guess as time went on, the older relatives softened.\"\n\"Some of it may have involved some girl(?), and there were a lot of accusations being thrown around.\"\n\"they've changed their story\"\n\"he was the oldest son and the family was very traditional.\"\n\"even though they aren't thrilled about his wife\"\n\nI'm making WILD assumptions here, but what I'm hearing is, he either\nA. Got a girl pregnant and your family forced him to choose between them and her or maybe to get an abortion/adoption.\nB. Had \"responsibilities\" piled on to him as the oldest son and found a girl who encouraged him to live his own life and your family couldnt handle it,\nOr C. Picked a girl your family didn't (and still doesn't) like or approve of and chose to stay by her.\nCould be she was of a different race and they're racist, could be she was of a different class and they're classist, could be a million things. But your brother has the right to choose who he wants to be with and if your family is so awful that they drove away their oldest son at only 18, they should be the ones you don't want at the wedding, not Alex. If any of this is true and you find out about it, could you live with yourself for purposely excluding him? If so, go for it. I personally, could not. You say in a comment that you are curious but wouldn't know what to say if you did talk. Why? Just ask for his side. \"What's your side?\" There ya go,  three words. Or don't even! Just reach out for a relationship! Were you born and raised with all your friends? Doubt it. At some point you had to found a relationship with them. Why are you adverse to getting to know him? \nNot to mention weddings cost a lot. I would be jumping at the chance to have someone pay for parts lol. If your wife thinks you should bring him and isn't concerned about being \"overshadowed\", why is it so important? Moreover, are you going to walk him in alone with a spotlight shining on him? If not, the odds of everyone focusing on him are slim to none. I say that as a man who saw my family for the first time in 11 years and was not spoken to most of the night because a niece wanted to show everyone her dance skills.\nIf that overshadowing thing is TRULY the only issue, why not have your family bring him down a week or two before for a nice reunion thing or what have you. Everyone gets to see him, catch up,  beg forgiveness, have cake, go to your wedding the next week, pop the champagne, get on the plane, and you're on your honeymoon before you know it saying \"Alex who?\" Just a thought", "Sure, ruin your own wedding for some money that you probably won't get.

If they have that money, they can throw a family reunion and invite him to that.", "NTA", "NOPE. NTA.\n\nYour wedding isn't the place for your family to fix whatever they collectively broke. They can have an Alex reunion on their time and their dime. Not your wedding day.", "NTA", "NTA \n\nThis day is about you not your brother.  If your family would like to invite him have a celebration the next day and tell him you would be happy to meet him then.  \n\nYou can tell him yourself why you are not comfortable him showing up on THAT day.", "NTA. Your wedding would be a reunion and everyone will ignore you! Don\u2019t do it. Let them plan something else. You will regret it the rest of you life if you invite him and your family makes YOUR wedding all about Alex!!!  Let the prodigal son return for HIS own party reunion.", "You can arrange a meeting for all before wedding so that's how your wedding day won't be any reunion when you invite him in your wedding. NTA", "NTA \n\nBut to be honest, you don't know the guy and he doesn't know you.\n\nIt could be an opportunity for all involved to come out on top, ask for them to pay full price for catering. If they do not accept, then your brother's no show was on them. If they do, use the saved money for a good honeymoon.\n\nIf things go bad, blame your family for it and use it over them to not have to listen to their future requests if you need to, and you still get to go on a honeymoon to relax yourself.\n\nIf things end up going well, you have a brother again, your parents have a son again, use it over them to not have to listen to their future requests since you already did them a big favour, and you still get to go on a honeymoon to relax yourself.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut seriously NTA in any way.", "NTA. This is what family reunions are for. Not weddings.", "To be estranged from your entire family at 18 is pretty extreme, and unless he made other people unsafe I don't think he deserved that. Having the whole family close ranks against him would have been really scary and isolating. Being asked to meet them all at the same time would be terrifying to me.\n\nMaybe I missed something, but I'm not clear if Alex has indicated any agreement with this wedding plan, just being open to a visit. If I was him, I would not be down for this even if you were super psyched about it happening at your wedding. A day when people are emotional, maybe drunk, and all gathered together with an audience around? Recipe for disaster. Overwhelming for Alex, such a high potential for someone to freak out if it's not the perfect, magical reunion they imagined, etc. You could make some variation of this argument to more reasonable members of your family.\n\nIf you're comfortable doing it, you could also try reaching out to him directly. Acknowledge that neither of you really had a choice in your estrangement (keeping contact with an 8 year old without being in contact with their parents isn't really an option) and that you're curious about him and would like to connect. If you can open a line of communication and get along, you could be an ally/safe person for him when he reintroduces himself to the extended family (preferably a few at a time). I think that would be really kind of you.", "NTA-DON\u2019T INVITE RELATIVES YOU DON\u2019T WANT THERE. I did this with my cousin because my mom thought he was doing better. I did not want to and it\u2019s been 5 years later and I still regret it. Don\u2019t do it just to please them.

If they want to organise a family function to reconnect... they can pay for it and have it well before the wedding.\n\nDo not introduce Drama into your wedding for the sake of your family. have them pay for a visit where the sole focus is on reconnecting.", "I agree that your wedding should not be the venue of their magical reunion and it needs to happen before your wedding but not at the wedding. Furthermore you have a bigger problem with your fianc\u00e9 eyeing up the discount as a reason to be a sellout. If she really cares about a discount remind her that there\u2019s always the courthouse or you can always just cut out your entire half of the family which would dramatically reduce costs in a lot of things as well. NTA", "That's a good point actually:\n\n>he's had years to try and get in touch with you and chose not to\n\nWhy is OP hving this huge sacrifice pushed on him? Alex is \\~10 years older, and has apparently been in touch with extended family; so he could easily have reached out to OP when OP was 18+. But he didn't.\n\nOP owes absolutely none of these people, including Alex, the opportunity to take over his wedding. NTA.", "From what I've heard, it took years for anyone to want to talk to him besides the one aunt, then he was the one refusing. \n\nBy 2020, he was willing to come to Easter that year, but then that couldn't happen, they had a baby, and things went dark again. \n\nI don't know what anyone has said besides what they say directly to us. They talk to each other and Alex in Polish about all of that, which the rest of us grandchildren never learned.", "Considering he and that girl are now married and the only child I've heard of from that is like 3 years old, I'd have to think it's probably not A.\n\nMy family is very traditional but has eased up a lot. All of us grandchildren are technically 2nd gen(?) but Alex was born immediately after they came here, the rest of us were 10+ years after.", "The wife too - if the family who are wanting Alex to be invited are themselves only begrudgingly inviting her, then what if *she* is the problem? OP is really going in blind here, and his fiancee is being super naive about the whole thing.\n\nAbsolutely agree with you, and the above. Weddings are not the place for others to have their big events (engagement / baby annoucement, reconciliations, whatever).\n\nIf getting back in touch with Alex is so important to these family members, they can make the effort to arrange something themselves - none of OP's business, not his problem to solve, and he certainly doesn't have to sacrifice his wedding day for it.\n\n(Edit: spelling.)", "But he will", "OP definitely needs to go fact finding, learn why Alex was estranged since everyone is being so evasive on the subject. The family being very traditional and everyone excommunicating him is a lead, maybe he didn't want to follow an expected path, or his personal life had something about it contradicting the traditional values. Maybe he's come into money and they want an in on a cash flow.\n\nWhatever it is, they want to make a big song and dance, a public and lavish one, which is why they're piggybacking on the wedding. If OP does want to meet Alex then it may be best to do it after the wedding, so that there's no risk of his return stealing OP's thunder at the event.", "Definitely. I don't have a phone number, and it feels awkward cold messaging him.", "We've stalked them on social media and there wasn't like an obvious problem with either of them. They're not wildly wealthy or anything like that. They seem aggressively average.", "By them does that include this girl, or another partner?", "Both him and the girl.", "NTA.

Tell the family you FULLY agree on reconciliation. You\u2019re excited to finally meet him. But this is SO important that the wedding just isn\u2019t the time. He should have his own event, not have to share yours.
