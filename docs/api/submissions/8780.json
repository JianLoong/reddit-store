My fiancee's side is done and we've worked out friends. The only thing left is my side. I thought I had everyone, but then I was reminded about my much older brother, Alex. \n\nSurprising, because I thought everyone hated him. I was too young to remember very much, but from what I do remember and from what people said for years after, he may have been the oldest, but there were no friends for him in the family, and it was very mutual. They said was troubled, over-dramatic, and couldn't make a single good decision. There was never a day without an argument. Some of it may have involved some girl(?), and there were a lot of accusations being thrown around. He moved out at 18, when my sister and I were 4 and 8. He cut contact with us. Since everyone stopped talking about him a few years later, I figured it was the same for them, but one of my aunts was keeping tabs on him. I guess as time went on, the older relatives softened. For a few years now, they've all been wanting to reconcile things with Alex. \n\nIt's been slow going, but within the two years, he's shown interest in coming out for a visit. It hasn't worked out with holdidays, so now everyone really wants me to invite Alex to my wedding as a show of reconciliation to invite him back to the family and so he can see everyone. \n\nI don't want to. I don't even know this guy, and I don't want my wedding to turn into some prodigal son family reunion. My family says I can't possibly know what was happening back then, and they've changed their story to everything just being personality differences and normal teenage behavior that was getting blown out of proportion on both sides because he was the oldest son and the family was very traditional. \n\nEveryone is begging me to do it. My family was even offering to pay the cost to have him and his wife there, even though they aren't thrilled about his wife, but now they're upping it to paying half of the catering cost if he's included. I still don't want to, but now my fianc\u00e9e thinks I'm being stubborn and I should just suck it up for that much of a discount.

This is supposed to be about you and your groom, not about troubled older brothers. I mean you probably have zero memories of him that aren\u2019t negatively colored by everyone else\u2019s retellings over the years, why would they think you want him at one of the happiest memories of your life?", "NTA. You don\u2019t have a relationship with your brother as of now. But I think YWBTA if you resisted having one just because your family is pressuring you to invite him. See if you can meet beforehand, because your own wedding is a really bad moment to see him for the first time, as you say. Insist on that.", "NTA. I would be less concerned about him taking away attention because of a family reconciliation. I would be more concerned about if it did not work and some family member(s) make a giant seen.", "Weddings are stressful enough without adding on a long-lost reunion.  Don't do it.  If he wants to come out at that time, try to find time to have dinner.  He can see all the rest of your family then - away from the wedding venues.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, you are right not to want your wedding used as a \"Welcome Back Alex\" party. You say you don't know this person so you're effectively being asked to invite a stranger (and stranger's wife who is even more of a stranger), and your family is also trying to hold you to ransom by offering money as a sweetener. Stick to your guns, and if the family want to throw money around suggest they hold their own WBA party at another time and pay for that!", "Nta. You don't have to get angry about this, but you don't have to go along with it either. The wedding is supposed to be about you and your husband. If Alex returns for the event will be about him - your relatives should apologise for wanting to do that to your wedding. If they want to have some grand reconciliation let them do it a few months before you get married so that you can meet the guy and decide if you want him there.", "NTA it's your wedding not a family reunion/therapy session. You don't know him, and they wouldn't expect you to invite a stranger if you didn't happen to share some DNA.

It\u2019s like they are using the wedding to make up for their past problems but understandably you are unhappy having someone there who is a stranger to you and potentially dealing with tension between family members. A reunion and reconciliation should be a separate event from the wedding, it\u2019s putting too much pressure on a day that is supposed to be happy and focused on you and your partner. If you can meet your brother before the wedding and want him there after getting to know him then that\u2019s up to you but you shouldn\u2019t be pressured by family members who didn\u2019t help you get to know him sooner. You were a small child and they need to take responsibility for the estrangement.", "NTA. Please know that if your brother is invited to your wedding, you and your partner are going to be overshadowed completely. Its definitely not the time or place for a reunion like this but it\u2019s going to turn into some dramatic return of the estranged son. You and your partner are not going to matter. Keep that in mind when making your decision", "NTA - nope nope nope nope nope nope nope.  Do NOT allow your wedding to become overshadowed by some random family politics that directly impact your day - there was stuff that went on at our wedding, but it wasn't anything we had to deal with directly and only heard about later so it didn't matter to our day. This has the possibility to completely take over the day. If the family wants a get together ... let them schedule one themselves.", "NAH. It's hard to say... I get why you don't want your wedding to be about reconciliation with the lost brother but I also get why the family would be excited about it. \n\nWhy don't you guys try to see each other before? Try to have a family reunion before the wedding, and then you'll see how it will evolve.", "NAH.  You really don't know if he was the problem of if it was the adults.  You're on this forum, so you've probably read a bunch of stories where the child was treated poorly and went NC.  There is likely another side of the story and it sounds like others in your family are coming to that conclusion.  You don't need to invite anyone you don't want to, but there are going to be a number of people at your wedding you barely know (like your fianc\u00e9e family).  It wouldn't hurt to invite your brother.  Your choice, but instead of a distraction, it could be something that just adds to the joy of the day.", "Not only are you not the asshole, you should consider eloping if your family thinks it's OK to hijack your wedding for their own guilt trip reconciliation.

Offer to host the return of the first born NOW, and make it about you and he meeting and getting to know each other.  What makes you think the first time he comes back into the fold that HE wants it to be at this high stress, very risky venue?  It seems your family wants your wedding to be about drama, not the beginning of the rest of your life as a couple.  Take the meaning of your wedding back by making contact as soon as possible. This is real life, there\u2019s no need to allow a \u201cbig reveal\u201d. Good luck", "NTA. Put you foot down and be firm. Your wedding, your guest list period.", "NTA. You don't know him at all. If the family wants to reconcile with him they can plan it on their own time. Do you even know how to contact him? He may not even be interested in coming. You don't know what went down and how anyone is going to react if he does show up.", "NTA.  OMG!  NOOOOOOO!!  Do not let your family hijack your wedding and turn into a drama scene with the long lost black sheep of the family brother.  It's great if the family wants to reconnect and that can be done WITHOUT a wedding in the middle of it.  A long weekend or a dinner or whatever makes much more sense.  A wedding is NOT the time or place and it is not worth the monetary discount (and it really sucks that your family seems to think this is okay)", "NTA\n\n I believe your reservations are warranted. This idea of a grand family reunion **at** your wedding is 5x worse than a 'surprise wedding proposal'. Everyone that knew your brother will want to say hi and catch up, *everyone*. \n\nYour wedding could become a footnote. \n\nRelative 1- \"Remember when Alex came home after so many years away? It was so wonderful to see him and meet his wife!\" \"\n\nRelative 2- \"Oh yeah! I forget why he came back but isn't it great he's back in the family?\"\n\nRelative 3- \"Didn't OP get married around that time?\"\n\nAnd that fake scenario is contingent on Alex having matured into a great guy, what if he hasn't?", "NTA - First of all, this day should be about you and your husband getting married, not about the family reconnecting with your brother. Second, if he truly has not seen anyone in the family in over a decade, then seeing everyone at once is a huge mistake. Reconciliations like this need to be taken slow and should not be done at events that are already highly emotional.", "NAH\n\nHe wasn't present in your life earlier and hasn't made any effort to get back into your life recently; I see little reason to send the invite.", "DONT.
