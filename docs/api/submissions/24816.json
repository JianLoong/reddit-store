I'm wheeling one of em in from the dining room to her room and as I enter the room, this lady completely totals my back knee with her wheelchair leg rest causing me to fall and almost taking the patient with me but I managed to activate my spidey senses in time and held the chair up. Then this lady yells \"EXCUSE ME, IM TRYING TO GET INTO MY ROOM\". FINE, WHATEVER I GUESS SHES OLD. \nI get up and don't say anything and start prepping the patient near her bed, then I overhear the other lady talking to her social workers about how she hates It here and never gets to see her kids. Tbh, I just chuckled ever so slightly but she overheard and yelled \"THE FUCKS FUNNY\". alright, she asked, so i answered \"Yeah there's a reason they don't come visit, I spent one minute with you and I don't wanna see you ever again\". She starts getting belligerent so I just take my patient and wheel her back out  so I can continue the prepping. \nListen, I can see these people's medical history. She was not demented, schizophrenic, just morbidly obese and has hypertension w/ diabetes. Nothing to excuse her bs, but when I told the family they were horrified by my actions. Now I'm feeling kinda bad but not really because I feel justified. So, AITA? Should I have been kinder to my assaulted just cuz shes old lol ?\n(Edit: Yeah y'all are right, should've been the professional I was hired to be, New to this sort of job and I guess I'm not used to not being able to bite back.

She\u2019s living the dream. \n\nYTA", "YTA. Your bedside manner could maybe use some fine tuning. Big yikes", "ESH - She seems like a complete nightmare and you were probably right.

I\u2019m going to have to say ESH because of your job but as a citizen you\u2019re absolutely right. Oh poor me alone in a nursing home\u2026lady 99.99% of the time it\u2019s just you getting just desserts foe the way you treated people your whole life.

That was cold.", "YTA  \n\n\npeople can have bad days you judged this woman's entire personality on one interaction, you have no idea how she treats her family.", "NTA. She will treat people how she thinks she can get away with treating. She now knows that you bite back. Respect is earned. You can be professional without being a punching bag.", "YTA.  You judged this woman after 5 minutes.  You have no idea how bad living in a nursing home is and you were very unprofessional.

You probably should act like one.", "Let's see what you're like when you're old and thrown away by your loved ones and society and you've lost everything you built your whole life and your spouse is dead and your body is failing you.", "YTA. Yes, she was rude, but you were essentially a GUEST in HER home. And unless you're a whole lot more educated than you seem to be in your post, and maybe psychic besides, you are not qualified to decide from her chart whether or not her behavior is excusable. You honestly don't know what that woman has been through in her life, what abuse she may have suffered, or may even now be suffering. So don't pretend that access to her diagnosis list tells you all there is to know about her. You are there as a medical professional, albeit a low level one. Try to act like one. I worked in nursing homes for 25 years, and not all the residents are pleasant to deal with. But you suck it up and deal with them anyway, and you keep your feelings about them to yourself.", "NTA. The poor staff have to deal with her nastiness daily. You are their hero. (And you are probably right about her family). And she assaulted you, no one runs their chair into some one accidentally.\n\nI feel that entitled and unpleasant individuals will need to get used to their victims biting back. Service, retail, and medical personnel have had less patience with random viciousness lately.", "YTA. You are not fit for working with patients, because that requires empathy, and you have none.  And your ignorance is showing... just bc someone doesn't have dementia on their chart doesn't mean they don't have other mental health problems. Diabetes can cause depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Not to mention being in constant or severe pain can cause severe personality changes.  You have no idea what pain or suffering she is enduring, both physically and mentally.  For crying out loud! She is a nursing home patient!! That means she is at end of life and cannot care for herself.  That is painful and terrifying and there is only death waiting for her... no getting well. You are there to serve and care for people,  no matter what.  If you can't do that,  get a job as something where your talents (putting people in their place? ) can be put to good use. DMV supervisor, security services,  lawyer, or anything where being harsh is sometimes necessary to maintain order.  If you stay in patient care,  you'll just look like an AH because it's a bad fit for your personality.\n\nBTW.. that is literally the worst thing you can say to someone who is in a nursing home.  :(", "ESH Yeah, she does not have to be so nasty, but you are also being really unprofessional.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

BUT, you are right in everything else, i am genuinely worried of being reported but the social worker was smiling at me and i got this false sense of confidence from her in what I did. It would've been much simpler/less destructive to not have said anything back, especially in the way I did which I'm now realizing was going out of my way to make sure I bit back at her. Who do I think I am ? A regular guy. But I'm not, i was a hired medical personnel who had to do the job i was paid for and follow the \"not make someone suicidal\" guidelines.", "I am the asshole. I care about her wellbeing until she shows complete disregard for mine so I don't know if you're trying to excuse her attack on me with her being miserable. I've met plenty of miserable people who don't attack others. I agree with people telling me I'm unprofessional and that I judged her too quick, but I don't agree with people like you blatantly excusing her attack. It's one thing to say mean things, it's another to back end someone and have them fall along with almost having another person on a wheelchair fall which could've led to God knows what. I frankly don't care to empathize with someone that showed she didn't give two shits about my wellbeing or her roomates that is in the same position as her. BUT, i was very shitty for what i said, and i understand that now. I could've just been mad in silence. I just don't understand why you along with others steer the topic into this weird territory of justifying her actions. She was wrong, I was wrong.", "Just got a call from my boss where she reiterated to keep it nice, but she asked if I was doing okay. So no write up, no firing. I'm happy you're not my boss. Firing a worker for retaliating an assault with verbal rudness sounds pretty rough, even if he definitely was an asshole in the situation. Man aita is a tough asa crowd huh. I mean I appreciate most of the comments sticking to a point of professionalism and not being a dick while representing a company, but yall who are over her excusing the assault, asking for me to get reported or fired are a bit too hyper vigilant. People can make a SINGLE mistake and not lose their entire livelihood over it (depending on the mistake of course, but I'm not over here hitting her back like damn...)", "I mean,ive worked in enough nursing homes to say most people abandoned there deserve to be. With a few genuinely sad exceptions, old people left there by their \"loved\" ones were just not loved at all cause they were often abusers in one way or another. The ones who are visited often are the ones who didnt hurt people in their lives and are loved but you will hear horrific confessions of things they did from people who are never visited and they never see it as bad and genuinely dont understand why no ones visiting them.\n Just my opinion but if you're a kind,understandings person and you raise your family lovingly youre not likley to end up abandoned in a nursing home.", "Firstly I really admire you've taken care of these people for 25 years. I know how hard it is to work there, not personally because I wouldn't say my job is too hard, but the nurses, cna, housekeeping. Man.. yall have hearts of gold or steel to keep up with it. I am infact dumber than I sound in the post, so mentioning medical history was ineffective as well as inappropriate, I just thought it'd give credence to the fact that she willingly did this with no remorse. You are right, I should've kept it to myself, especially with the luxury of only having to visit particular nursing homes once a week", "Lol I would be surprised if I was in the first 100 people to say those exact words. Probably comes up a lot.", "Oh I have no doubt she was annoyed you were entering her room. Because who the hell are you & why are you in her room? \u201cAttacked\u201d is inflammatory language. \n\nAlso..... \u201cdemented\u201d? Really? Really? Is that medical language you picked up in optometry school. \n\nYour compassion & respect for the elderly is heartwarming (that\u2019s sarcasm btw)", "What you call an \"assault\" was an elderly, borderline disabled person in a wheelchair in a confined space.  99+% chance it was completely an accident and you even said she said \"Excuse me.\"  I was visiting a relative in a nursing home and someone else from that floor opened the door and wandered in.  It wasn't a home invasion, it was old people stuff.", ">I'm happy you're not my boss.\n\nI'm happy you aren't my employee.  You have to be cognizant of your environment and Nursing homes require a certain type of patience and finesse which you seemingly do not have.  This is not me being rough, this is me being realistic.  You got away with it this time, the next you may not be so fortunate.\n\nI speak as someone who has a relative in a Nursing home.  If anyone spoke like that to my relative, I promise you they would have been written up.", "I don't know why this was downvoted. From everything I've seen, it's accurate. My family tends to live a fairly long time, so I've seen a lot of nursing home time, almost exclusively for rehab. For six separate people so far. We couldn't wait to get them out of there and back home, and we visited every day. Because they were good people whose presence we valued as family members. We loved them.  \n\n\nAnd on the other end, my estranged grandfather who cheated on my grandmother with the (barely legal) babysitter, got her pregnant, and dumped her? Well, he just called my mom last month after twenty years of no contact because he's dying alone now.", "Wow, so life is fair then!", "Everything else aside, \"demented\" is the correct medical term to describe someone with dementia. \n\nThank you, carry on.", "I actually did not go to optometry school, optometry tech is just fancy for the doctors helper/assistant. I don't uh do specifically high end things. Also, I thought demented is a term to describe a person with dementia ? If it is a rude way to describe someone with dementia, than I'm ignorant and will correct myself for the future. I am going into her room with HER ROOMATE ?? You're being sarcastic, but I genuinely do feel I am compassionate with them. I sit and talk them through the whole process much longer than the doctor would like because I don't want them to misunderstand what's going on and regulary vouch for them with the doctor when they want new glasses or extra care. I actually find myself having a very hard time cutting them off when they speak about their life because i know they just want to talk to someone and I'm privileged in that my job is not too demanding so i get to take a little extra time even if it gets the doc annoyed. I really don't know what you're talking about and how you came up with these conclusions. I think you're mistaking compassion and respect with patience. Attacked is inflammatory ? She did it on purpose, she pushed herself into me at full force, not a tiny dink or something. What would be the word you want me to use, pushed? Okay, she pushed me to the floor and almost pushed her roommate down from her wheelchair. Sounds much more aquatic I guess ?", "Oh shit you were there next to me ? Shoulda tried to help me up man. Perhaps you didn't catch it in the post since you were reading with fumes coming outta your nostrils, it was not a polite excuse me. It was her yelling to me on the floor \"EXCUSE ME IM TRYING TO GET INTO MY ROOM\". It wasn't an accident, even the social worker didn't say shit to me saying what I said but smiling, be it in awkwardness or agreement, most likely the former if we're being real. Doesn't make what I said right, but shut up with your reality distortion because you couldn't bother to read clearly. I didnt sugarcoat what i said nor what she did. How are you gonna sit there ensure it was an accident when this lady showed no remorse and made it a point to yell, AND YOU WEREN'T THERE. If i remind you of a mean girl i'll take that over you reminding me of the delusions of grandeur these people go through at the homes, because atleast i can and will fix myself and my bedside manners, you can't do much about whatever complex you have of yourself as some arbiter of truth over someone else's experience. Also, elderly, Borderline disabled 350 pound of a force that could've broken the patient i was wheelchairing unless I caught her chair mid fall. Yes I was assaulted, that was an attack, but I care more if that attack led me to drop the very frail patient I was in charge of at the time. AGAIN I AM STILL WRONG FOR SAYING WHAT I SAID, you just have me getting defensive with how much non factual garbage you're saying. I made a mistake thinking It was worth it to act so unprofessional, I'm not over here kicking and yelling at old people for fun. I am actually becoming a nurse tho so you got me there hehe, but I got this job to literally LEARN how to deal with people, not that I have that much issue I guess unless they fucking hit me, but even that Is something I have to learn to be professional about. My God now I'm fuming too \ud83d\ude24", "Yeah just searched it up, it is indeed not the way to describe a person with dementia. I sincerely didn't know, so I apologize", "You really want to blame this woman ... so sure. Sounds good. She attacked you & you verbally attacked her back you\u2019re even. \n\nThen you walked out of the nursing home, went on your merry way & continued living your life. Meanwhile, she\u2019s still sitting in the same wheelchair, in the same room, with the same crappy food, hating her life & missing her kids. She will be doing the same thing she did today, tomorrow, the next day, next week, next month... perhaps there is in fact a reason for her \u201cbs\u201d.\n\nYou\u2019re correct it can mean affected with dementia. That\u2019s not how I interpreted your use of it. I apologize.", "Yeah, you definitely have the temperament of someone who should be around fragile vulnerable people.", "Demented is still an accepted term for the use of charting, though describing the person as \"cognitively impaired\" or \"with cognitive decline\" is preferred and \"demented\" is getting phased out."]}
