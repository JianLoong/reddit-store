Up until recently I paid for all food/household supplies, now we split because I am tired of covering\n* He borrowed 50K from me 2 years ago. We want to combine finances when we get married, so the logic was I should help because I had excess money. I was reluctant but he promised to pay me back in a few months. Then he decided to pursue higher education but said he could still pay. \n* He hasn\u2019t paid me back. I stopped loaning money, but he now takes out school loans. He uses that money to buy recreational things, like a new car. His logic is that he will make a lot of money after he graduates so it is OK to be in debt, doctors graduate with lots of debt. I grew up poor and don\u2019t like to spend money I don\u2019t have\n* He said would find a better job/internships while in school, but he hasn\u2019t over a year later. He keeps saying he will but refuses to commit to a timeline now.\n\n**Recent Events**  \nSince our relationship has been less than traditional, I have been trying to make it more equal starting a few months ago. If he wants a massage, I\u2019m fine with giving one but I want one too. He doesn\u2019t think this is right because I used to cater to him more. I told him about our relationship agreement and that he is not fulfilling his provider role so why is he expecting me to perform favors when I don\u2019t want to. I'm not withholding it, I\u2019ll do it if I feel like it but don\u2019t want to be guilted/expected to do it. If he doesn\u2019t want to be the provider, I\u2019m ok with a non-trad relationship, but he still wants to have the traditional dynamic.\n\nNow, he is mad at me for putting pressure on him to find a job and is sad that I don\u2019t trust him. He says he will find a job and doesn\u2019t need to be reminded by me. He doesn't think it's fair to change our dynamic because he will start making a lot of money in 4-5 years and I should just be patient instead.\n\nNote: I don\u2019t mind him being in school but I don't feel like the situation is fair at the moment.", "created_utc": 1667595965, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymafvy/aita_for_changing_the_relationship_dynamic/", "score": 4, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He sounds like he's mooching off of you, but you are either the most gullible person on Earth or you're really in denial.", "NTA \n\nYou've been more than gracious and he has done nothing but take from you. Who's to say that when he does start making money that he won't break up with you so that he doesn't have to pay you back? No, do for you because that's what he's been doing this while time. Change what rules you need to and, if he doesn't like it, leave him. He's setting you both up for failure. Don't let him drag you down too.", "There's a reason most people have abandoned the \"traditional\" dynamic.  This rarely works out well for the woman - especially one who is a high achiever.\n\nThe money and years you've invested are sunk costs (unlikely you will see this 50K without a legal fight). Don't let this be what keeps you with this dude. A man like this is the type who thinks he deserves to \"trade up\" once he gets his MD.

I think it\u2019s totally valid and absolutely wonderful that you\u2019ve communicated your feelings and expectations of the relationship. This man sounds\u2026 dysfunctional to put it kindly. I think he would be hard pressed to find a good partner like you. I would revisit the goals and the purpose of this relationship in a conversation between the two of you. Express your desire to grow with him as a person. You\u2019ve done so much and continue to do so much for him, but it takes 2 to tango. A healthy relationship takes effort on both sides. Could he be struggling with his mental health? Just remember, it\u2019s you and him vs the problem, not you vs him. I hope everything works out for you OP", "NTA he\u2019s a broke baby", "NTA, and you sound like you\u2019re a good partner and have your sh*t together. Your partner on the other hand, does not seem to be on the same page as you and you owe it to yourself to really evaluate your relationship and think if this is the type of person you want to drag with you for the rest of your life.", "You need to leave him.\n\nYou are SO being taken advantage of. \n\nHe's got himself a sugar momma, why would he want to change?", "NTA. You have every right to renegotiate the terms of your relationship. He isn\u2019t fulfilling his role so you are not obligated to fulfill the role you agreed to. Time to set some new rules based on your current dynamic.\n\nAlso, he does realize he has to pay school loans back, right? And just because he gets a relatively high paying job doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll be rolling in money and able to pay things off quickly.", "Oh gtf outta there. NTA.", "What the actual F. I think it\u2019s super gross that you want to be led by a man\u2026 but to your specific point, if this guy wants a helpmeet then he has to bring something of value to the table to. Edit to add NTA but you do have questionable judgment", "NTA. But honey, this should be a wakeup call for you. He wants extra perks while being a mooch. It's highly unlikely his attitude and ambition are going to change after all this time. And he owes you a ton of money with no means (or intention) to repay you.\n\nAre you ready to be the family breadwinner and doing the majority of the housework permanently, while he cosplays as someone pulling his own weight? Because that's what's coming.", "NTA rethink the relationship and save yourself the headache, money and toxic energy. The sooner you dump him, the sooner you will be free/happy. Give him a 30-60 days deadline to get his ish together, if not move on from him.", "YTA to yourself. \n\nYou are living with a master manipulator, who is not only financially irresponsible, but also demanding your play the docile little wife while being the main provider, sole housekeeper and being guilttripped out of 50k.\n\nIt's not going to get better and this money is GONE. You need to get out, otherwise every penny you ever earn and every ounce of self esteem you still have will go too.", "He was working previously and had a similar salary as me before going back to school. I lent him money because he didn't want to sell some investments", "Thanks, good to know that changing the rules doesn't make me TA", "\\> If he actually loved you, he would be willing to make some compromises now to make you feel cared for and appreciated.\n\nGood point, gotta do some re-evaluating. I will try to frame it to him in this way to see what he says", "He previously made more money than me, then things changed when he went back to school. Part of me hopes it's a temporary situation.. We originally agreed I could be a SAHM and he would support us, but that has been delayed obviously.", "Thanks for the supportive message! I hope it works out for us too. You have a good point--he is definitely struggling with his mental health. He doesn't believe in therapy (gets mad when I push it) and I'm his only emotional support (as a traditional dude, he doesn't talk about that stuff with his friends/family). He's improved in this last year on his own, but still seems be stuck. He refuses to talk to me about career/finance topics now because it stresses him out. I like the perspective of us vs. the problem though", "Yeah, we used to be on the same page, but not anymore. A part of me thinks it's the depression and hopes it's just a bump in our journey, but he's not getting help for it", "Thanks for your comment! It's hard for me to tell because I haven\u2019t talked to anyone else about it. Felt like I could be TA for making the relationship more \u201ctransactional\u201d rather than based on \u201clove\u201d", "Well said.", "Absolutely! People change. Relationships change. Obviously the rules would have to change in either instance.", "I actually live the \"traditional\" life as a SAHM now. But when we were both working, we split chores according to who worked less hours, which meant he did most chores. d\n\nIf your partner doesn't see you as a true equal, its a bad idea partner to enter into a \"traditional\" relationship. Even if he does end up earning a lot, you'll then be financially dependant on someone who will use that as leverage.", "You keep saying traditional\u2026 But it\u2019s nothing traditional in your relationship. You took on both roles by yourself. May I ask what exactly are YOU getting out of this relationship?\n\nIn my opinion the traditional gender roles worked \u201cwell\u201d (not really) 100-200 years ago, when women had no choice of education or work, so they stayed home and took care of household and family while the men worked and provided. Now, in 2022 women still expected to do all these traditional roles PLUS work. So it\u2019s just added more to our plates, while the traditional male roles haven\u2019t changed, if only they got easier as women contribute to the expenses. \n\nThere is nothing wrong with wanting a traditional relationship. There is also nothing wrong wanting to be equals. Each for their own. But what you can\u2019t have is both! You either the man of the house, and that comes with responsibility of earning enough to support both of you. Or you two are equal, and he is contributing not only financially but also doing chores around the house 50-50! \n\nYou have been a wonderful partner, who\u2019s been lured into a relationship under false pretences. This is not what you have been promised! If he would be the man, that he claims to be, then he never would have asked money from you! (Even if you offered, he would have been too proud to accept) Well, that\u2019s not the case, is it?! Also, when you tried to communicate your feelings, as you do with your partner, did he listen and try to do better? Nope\u2026 Think long and hard, if you really signed up for this. I don\u2019t believe the situation will change or get better. Maybe for a little while, but he will always go back to the old ways. It\u2019s way too comfortable for him. \n\nObviously NTA regarding your situation. However, you are t a for yourself if you let him continue treating you this way\u2026", "Well, he's getting lots of love. Thousands of dollars of it."]}
