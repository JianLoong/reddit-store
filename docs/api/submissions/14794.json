I guessed (correctly, as it turned out) that this was likely the same company the building itself was insured by, since presumably that\u2019s who would have had the opportunity and motivation to offer them a \u201cspecial deal\u201d for signing up individual tenants. I then called that insurer, confirmed they insured the building itself and explained I was aware of a potential property risk to such-and-such property.\n\nThe insurer helpfully connected me to their underwriters, who called me back and wanted all the details, then asked me to put it all down in an email also so they didn\u2019t miss anything. I don\u2019t know what happened after that precisely, just that everyone in building management got replaced all at once rather suddenly.\n\nMy assumption is that my tale of woe was of especial interest due to a couple rather big national and international news stories that had happened in the last year or so having to do with house / building explosions from gas issues. \n\nAlso, I like to imagine that it\u2019s possible the gas company guy may have made life difficult for the original pipe fitter \u2026 he was an old salt not inclined to believe me at first but he got increasingly angry once he found multiple leaks and then once the original workman (evidently the owner of a local company doing new building pipe fitting) tried to tell him that my nose, his nose, the bubble test results, my cheapo Amazon gas sniffer AND his multi-thousand dollar sniffer equipment were all imagining the leaks. I guess the gas co guy had retired from pipe fitting and taken a job with the gas company responding to possible leak reports, but did not take at ALL kindly to being spoken down to by the contractor. \n\nI don\u2019t know how contracting and pipe fitting work goes, but if that were my business I don\u2019t suppose I\u2019d want to piss off the gas company \u2026", "This is a while back so I can\u2019t recall exact wording, but basically the plumber showed up while the gas guy and I were chatting (after he found the leaks, I mentioned that the building manager had told me I was probably just smelling sewer gas, so the gas co guy had volunteered to check out my sink plumbing, too, for giggles, which apparently was \u201cnon-standard\u201d and while not currently a problem, had the strong potential for a future problem, so at this point he was just speculating on why anyone would plumb a kitchen that way). \n\nUpon showing up, the plumber tried to take control of the situation and tell the gas co guy that he\u2019d already fielded two complaints from me and I was just imagining things. The Amazon sniffer I\u2019d bought was on the counter, so he jumped to explaining it was cheap equipment and not reliable. I think he didn\u2019t realize the gas guy had already been there a while and found the leaks already. The young woman from maintenance (who they\u2019d sent to investigate a possible gas leak while she was *very* pregnant, by the way), was there and I noted she\u2019d found a leak with a bubble test, which he also claimed was for some reason unreliable. At this point the gas guy said no, he\u2019d checked and yes, there was a leak, at which point I think the plumber was, I assume, in too deep to back down so he claimed he had expensive sniffer equipment and it had previously showed nothing, at which point the gas guy pulled his out and the contractor said his was calibrated etc (as though the gas guy\u2019s wouldn\u2019t have been \u2026). \n\nThe gas co guy said he\u2019d actually identified three leaks, and proceeded to turn the valve back on and demonstrate (all the windows were open and the door was open in the apartment). The contractor guy back-peddled and tried to imply this was a shock and maybe spontaneous just then. It was embarrassing but in a delicious way. The gas guy not only showed all *three* leaks but talked everyone (several building maintenance people had showed up and politely asked if they could observe, and I\u2019d welcomed them all in, so there were like six or eight people at one point) through how one of the leak points was a very obvious and rookie problem (not sealing some pipe fitting for exhaust apparently so if the water heater wasn\u2019t burning fuel perfectly, gas would leak out between the sections when one of the materials was colder or hotter than the other maybe?) and another was another well-known risk of using certain fittings with certain other fittings if not installed correctly (metal to plastic and then over tightening the plastic connection, causing it to potentially crack and then each successive tightening would just make it worse \u2026 originally to placate me, the contractor had tightened the fittings even though I was \u201cimagining\u201d the leak, just to \u201cmake me feel better\u201d). I forget where the third leak point was but anyway at least two of them were down to piss-poor skills of the installer, and the gas co guy made this explicit repeatedly. \n\nAt each revelation I recall the contractor trying to explain away why it was super rare or hard to find or no big deal, and the gas co guy was just not having it. The maintenance crew keep totally silent during all of this. I like to assume that they were privately enjoying the lesson and appreciating the contractor getting his ass handed to him after he dogged the one maintenance lady\u2019s efforts with the bubble test.", "Gaslighting is bringing up things that's DIDN'T happen and framing it in a way to make you feel like it was true and that your recollection of the events is wrong.\n\n\nThe landlord isn't changing any of the past events here.... he's just lying.", "Exactly! OP had no idea what the cause was so no way to mitigate it until it was solved ASAP. This isn\u2019t something to wait until the next morning to solve because it could have been a gas leak and OP had no idea if CO levels were safe to occupy the apartment (or even the surrounding ones!). Not to mention that even if the super came immediately, they don\u2019t have the skills to diagnose the problem. \n\nPersonally, I would try to confirm who the owner is and notify them if it\u2019s a super or employee. If I was the owner, I would let him go for this. If this is the owner, I would definitely move buildings because he\u2019s showed that a slum lord. Who knows what else is wrong under the surface", "One winter when I was still living in the little house in the woods, I mentioned to my landlord that if the snow took the power out, my partner and I had a generator we could hook some things up to. He went a little green and said \"You're running it outside, though, right? Not in the house? Not ever in the house, and no gas heaters or burners in the house either?\"\n\nTurns out--landlord was a policeman and a volunteer for the local fire company--a couple of weeks earlier he'd been on scene for the aftermath of a CO event that took out an entire family, grandparents and babies and all. I'm sure that your firemen were much happier to see you responding well than to have to pull you out on a stretcher.", "This. You do NOT want to fuck around and find out with CO. A landlord should be scared. This is the stuff that kills people silently. \n\nIf you are sacred your CO detector is going off or may not be working, just call. It\u2019s almost always too late if you think it\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s really really dangerous. Do not waste time feeling bad about a landlord it really is your life at stake."]}
