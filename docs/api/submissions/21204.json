{"id": 21204, "submission_id": "14pb7di", "title": "WIBTA for reporting my mom and sister for \"stealing\" my car", "selftext": "I 24(m) live with my mom in a rural part of the USA. For context when it comes to my sister(37), she is much older and we come from different fathers, and both grew up in split custody arrangements. We are not particularly close, almost acquaintances moreso than siblings. I dont really feel any familial connection even though I love her, I dont feel obligated to bend backward for her.\n\nWell sister lives 2 hours away (in a much more urban area) and is currently going through a divorce. Her and her ex-husband only had one vehicle and it belongs to the ex-husband, so when they split, he took the car. Sister has 4 daughters and works a full time job, I on the other hand work from home and have no real external responsibilities.\n\nMy mom came to me asking if my sister could borrow my car for a couple of months until the divorce is finalized so she has a way of transporting her and her kids to wherever they need to be without the financial burden of purchasing another car, or relying exclusively on ridesharing.\n\nI just recently bought my car('12 V8 Mustang), and its my first vehicle ever, i didnt get a hand-me-down, or get one as a present when I turned 16 or 18, I was basically immobile except occasionally being allowed to drive my moms car, or when my dad had me I could get ubers. Getting my own vehicle was extremely liberating (minus the loan), and I don't feel trapped at home, so when I was approached with this proposal I flat out said no.\n\nI can totally understand the justification for letting her use my car for a couple months, but aside from the fact I dont want to lose my newfound sense of freedom, I also just dont want someone else driving my car, and maybe thats selfish of me.\n\nOver the last few days my mom and sister have been trying to convince me to let her use the car, saying that she would pay for the car payment while she has the car, or that she'd pay for insurance if she has it longer than anticipated. No matter what they brought to the table, I kept saying no. Much to their dissatisfaction.\n\nFF to this morning, I realize that my mom isn't home. I opened our garage to see that her car was still there, but mine was not. I immediately know what has happened and call my mom about the situation. She just tries to calm me down and have me try to picture it from my sisters point of view, but im just flushed with rage and instead just tell her that im going to report the vehicle as stolen instead. She just hung up the phone.\n\nAs of now i presume my car is down with my sister, and i am seriously considering reporting it stolen and naming her and my sister as perpetrator and conspirator. I really dont want it to go that far, and I hope that we could instead work this out. But what I initially said as an angry threat, im starting to really consider as an option. I just dont know if its worth burning so many bridges over a car, but the fact that my family wont respect my boundaries or my property is so frustrating.\n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1688366318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pb7di/wibta_for_reporting_my_mom_and_sister_for/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Plus she has her own car, why does your sister need to drive YOUR car, when mom's can fill the job.", "NTA.  They needed to look for a long-term rental for your sister or buy her a beater or work with the soon-to-be-ex to liberate enough money to buy a decent car.  The rental wouldn\u2019t be cheap, and they\u2019d probably do better buying an inexpensive car than paying that amount.  But what they don\u2019t get to do is steal your car.", "NTA 100%. Report it stolen right away. Give them your sisters address and say you believe that is who stole it. It's theft pure and simple. Not only that but if your half-sister has an accident, it will be your insurance that skyrockets. You did not grow up together and you owe her absolutely nothing.", "NOPE, did you tell them NO?!  Then what mom did **IS** steal.  Now keep in mind that although you have the right to report mom for theft, YOUR HOME LIFE will not be the same. So, while reporting mom you had better be finding another place to live.  SISTER can afford all those options, SHE should spend that proffered money ON a vehicle she can own and drive whenever she wants.", "NTA. Yeah, report it. You're not going to see that car again if you don't. Maybe I'm just thinking the worst, but if they could steal it for 6 months,  they'll steal it forever.\n\nMaybe try and move out when you can as well if you're able to financially. That way they would have less of a say on what goes on with your belongings.", "NTA\n\nThey did steal it. No need for inverted commas.\n\nReport away. But line up somewhere to move to, because your mom will be kicking you out.", "NTA, do it. You told them no and your sister did it anyway, so that's stealing and you're not lying.\n\nAlso your sister isn't on your car insurance thingy (french here, idk the term sorry) and if she have an accident you will be responsible. Protect yourself and the others, report her asap. Because I think if you don't they'll consider it \"empty threats\" and your sister will do it again.", "NTA but do consider the possible repercussions.  On the don\u2019t report is stolen side: Are you going to lose your living situation over this? On the do report it stolen side: what happens if she\u2019s an accident or damages or destroys your car?  \n\nOne way I might approach this is by calling my insurance company and asking them: 1) hypothetically speaking, if a family member who is not a member of my household took my car without my permission and got into an accident, what would happen? And then, 2) if said family member took my car with permission and got into an accident, what would happen?  \n\nThen you can go back to your mom and sister and say hey I talked to my insurance company and they say that I need to report the car stolen or else such and such will happen. . . I don\u2019t want to do that, so please return it by the weekend (or whatever).\n\nhttps://www.johnfoy.com/faqs/what-happens-if-someone-else-is-driving-my-car-and-gets-in-an-accident/", "NTA \n\nText them both on group chat \n\nYou asked to borrow my car and I told you both no.

Report it immediately. You said NO and your Mom took it anyway.", "NTA.  If mom wanted her to have a car that badly, she could have loaned her own and then insisted you drive her wherever she needed to go if you didn't want to loan her your car.   I'm not sure how a mustang really helps a mom of four anyway, especially if any of them are young enough to need car seats/boosters.    \n\n\nYour car has been stolen.  The fact that you know who stole it doesn't change the fact that it was stolen.  You are well within your rights to call the police, and depending on your insurance coverage, may even be obligated to do so.  Just be aware that calling the police is going to throw a grenade into your family, and possibly impact your living situation.", "NTA the stole it without your permission report them what happens if she was to get drunk and drive that\u2019s on your insurance I had this happen when I bought my first motorcycle and those aren\u2019t toys my brother stole it and I reported it missing when I found out who it was i didn\u2019t care that\u2019s your property if they have a problem your mom has a car why can\u2019t she give her car up", "NTA report it stolen.", "It\u2019s not less of a crime because you know the thief.", "NTA\n\ncall the police, pack your papers and start looking for a new place.  \nYour family has shown you that they don't respect your boundaries.\n\nAnd her divorce will go smoother when she can add criminal charges filed by her brother to her playbook /s", "NTA - if they dont have permission to use the car, it is in effect stealing.

You own the car, you pay the loan, you pay the insurance. They have no right to take it.  I'd even give the police a heads up on where you think it will be and that you didn't give permission for it to be taken.", "NTA. You know your mother took it, but you can't prove your sister knows its stolen.\n\nFile a police report, your mother stole your car and you think she brought it to your sister's. She clearly doesn't care about your opinion on the matter, you won't convince her to bring it back. And the longer you wait, the more convincing her inevitable lie that you gave permission will become.\nAnd I'm sorry that this happened to you.", "INFO. So your mother has a car, she could give to your sister but instead she tried to guilt you to give up your car instead for who knows how long and as this didn't worked, she stole from you?\n\nNTA. But maybe give your sister an ultimatum. Tell her, the car has to be back at your house - cleaned inside and outside and with a full tank or you will inform the cops and fill out a report.", "You live with your mom?
