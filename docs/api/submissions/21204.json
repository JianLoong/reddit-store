For context when it comes to my sister(37), she is much older and we come from different fathers, and both grew up in split custody arrangements. We are not particularly close, almost acquaintances moreso than siblings. I dont really feel any familial connection even though I love her, I dont feel obligated to bend backward for her.\n\nWell sister lives 2 hours away (in a much more urban area) and is currently going through a divorce. Her and her ex-husband only had one vehicle and it belongs to the ex-husband, so when they split, he took the car. Sister has 4 daughters and works a full time job, I on the other hand work from home and have no real external responsibilities.\n\nMy mom came to me asking if my sister could borrow my car for a couple of months until the divorce is finalized so she has a way of transporting her and her kids to wherever they need to be without the financial burden of purchasing another car, or relying exclusively on ridesharing.\n\nI just recently bought my car('12 V8 Mustang), and its my first vehicle ever, i didnt get a hand-me-down, or get one as a present when I turned 16 or 18, I was basically immobile except occasionally being allowed to drive my moms car, or when my dad had me I could get ubers. Getting my own vehicle was extremely liberating (minus the loan), and I don't feel trapped at home, so when I was approached with this proposal I flat out said no.\n\nI can totally understand the justification for letting her use my car for a couple months, but aside from the fact I dont want to lose my newfound sense of freedom, I also just dont want someone else driving my car, and maybe thats selfish of me.\n\nOver the last few days my mom and sister have been trying to convince me to let her use the car, saying that she would pay for the car payment while she has the car, or that she'd pay for insurance if she has it longer than anticipated. No matter what they brought to the table, I kept saying no. Much to their dissatisfaction.\n\nFF to this morning, I realize that my mom isn't home. I opened our garage to see that her car was still there, but mine was not. I immediately know what has happened and call my mom about the situation. She just tries to calm me down and have me try to picture it from my sisters point of view, but im just flushed with rage and instead just tell her that im going to report the vehicle as stolen instead. She just hung up the phone.\n\nAs of now i presume my car is down with my sister, and i am seriously considering reporting it stolen and naming her and my sister as perpetrator and conspirator. I really dont want it to go that far, and I hope that we could instead work this out. But what I initially said as an angry threat, im starting to really consider as an option. I just dont know if its worth burning so many bridges over a car, but the fact that my family wont respect my boundaries or my property is so frustrating.\n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1688366318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pb7di/wibta_for_reporting_my_mom_and_sister_for/", "score": 707, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And then, 2) if said family member took my car with permission and got into an accident, what would happen?  \n\nThen you can go back to your mom and sister and say hey I talked to my insurance company and they say that I need to report the car stolen or else such and such will happen. . .

I have a difficult enough time *as an adult* getting myself into the back seat of a 2 door- imagine trying to get small children (probably rowdy ones) into the back seat! *Especially* in a car seat, you absolutely cannot put that in the front passenger seat", "i did say 1 hour for  reason ;-)", "From the very little information OP has given, I get those vibes too, which is why I advised caution.\n\nHowever, none of us have lived his life, his mother's, his father's, his sister's, her daughter's or his step father.\n\nWe are all just internet strangers getting a small peek into many different cultures and family situations.\n\nOnce a bridge is burned it is difficult to rebuild, but a a temporary blockade is both effective and easily dismantled, once the situation is resolved.", "In the US where I worked car insurance claims if an accident occurred it would be on OPs insurance not the driver of the vehicle. \nHowever there are circumstances where the driver not the owner of the vehicle would be liable.
