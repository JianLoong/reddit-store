For context when it comes to my sister(37), she is much older and we come from different fathers, and both grew up in split custody arrangements. We are not particularly close, almost acquaintances moreso than siblings. I dont really feel any familial connection even though I love her, I dont feel obligated to bend backward for her.\n\nWell sister lives 2 hours away (in a much more urban area) and is currently going through a divorce. Her and her ex-husband only had one vehicle and it belongs to the ex-husband, so when they split, he took the car. Sister has 4 daughters and works a full time job, I on the other hand work from home and have no real external responsibilities.\n\nMy mom came to me asking if my sister could borrow my car for a couple of months until the divorce is finalized so she has a way of transporting her and her kids to wherever they need to be without the financial burden of purchasing another car, or relying exclusively on ridesharing.\n\nI just recently bought my car('12 V8 Mustang), and its my first vehicle ever, i didnt get a hand-me-down, or get one as a present when I turned 16 or 18, I was basically immobile except occasionally being allowed to drive my moms car, or when my dad had me I could get ubers. Getting my own vehicle was extremely liberating (minus the loan), and I don't feel trapped at home, so when I was approached with this proposal I flat out said no.\n\nI can totally understand the justification for letting her use my car for a couple months, but aside from the fact I dont want to lose my newfound sense of freedom, I also just dont want someone else driving my car, and maybe thats selfish of me.\n\nOver the last few days my mom and sister have been trying to convince me to let her use the car, saying that she would pay for the car payment while she has the car, or that she'd pay for insurance if she has it longer than anticipated. No matter what they brought to the table, I kept saying no. Much to their dissatisfaction.\n\nFF to this morning, I realize that my mom isn't home. I opened our garage to see that her car was still there, but mine was not. I immediately know what has happened and call my mom about the situation. She just tries to calm me down and have me try to picture it from my sisters point of view, but im just flushed with rage and instead just tell her that im going to report the vehicle as stolen instead. She just hung up the phone.\n\nAs of now i presume my car is down with my sister, and i am seriously considering reporting it stolen and naming her and my sister as perpetrator and conspirator. I really dont want it to go that far, and I hope that we could instead work this out. But what I initially said as an angry threat, im starting to really consider as an option. I just dont know if its worth burning so many bridges over a car, but the fact that my family wont respect my boundaries or my property is so frustrating.\n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1688366318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pb7di/wibta_for_reporting_my_mom_and_sister_for/", "score": 482, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And then, 2) if said family member took my car with permission and got into an accident, what would happen?  \n\nThen you can go back to your mom and sister and say hey I talked to my insurance company and they say that I need to report the car stolen or else such and such will happen. . .

My young adult children are very different to each other and also not close, but I would never make one sacrifice something major for them for the sake of the other one.\n\nSending you much needed, gentle hugs.", "I hope sister does have insurance though, in case she damages the car.\n\n(In the UK, at least, drivers are insured, not the car, so if an accident happens with an uninsured driver, you're SOL. Obviously idk where OP is.)", "Insurance goes after the owner of the car when something happens. That's OP.", "It\u2019s stolen. The police will not be happy if you knew where it was and did t tell them. I\u2019m also getting really hung up on them saying they will pay for this and that \u201cif she has it longer than anticipated\u201d. They are planning to keep your car for a LONG time. And where the hell does she plan to put 4 kids in a mustang???? It\u2019s not even an appropriate option.", "Very bad idea. \n\nIt's extremely unlikely that the cops would arrest them and pursue charges. In situations like these, they usually contact the person and threaten to arrest them. That's usually enough to get the car back. It's possible they'll be extra and arrest them, especially if they're Black, but you'll definitely get in trouble if you lie to the cops about not knowing where it is. \n\nUnfortunately, they've put you in a situation where you have no choice but to report it unless you can immediately go over there and get it back yourself. Keep in mind they might start a confrontation that ends badly if you do that.", "It\u2019s been hours, so I\u2019m wondering what happened. Did your sister bring your car back or did you report it stolen? Also, how did she get your keys to take your car?", "Then you\u2019d be lying to the police and filing a false report, both of which are crimes. You have to make up your mind whether you\u2019re going to report them or let them keep your car.", "Give them a time frame to return and tell if they don\u2019t u will report it then if they don\u2019t listen that\u2019s on them", "Don't file false reports trying to protect them, you'll only get yourself in legal trouble *with* them.", "Finally!!  That's what I was wondering.", "If it has rear seating, by putting 1 up front and 3 in the back.", "It is *possible* to drive a mustang carefully. But it probably isn't too comfortable to fit four kids and an adult in.", "Sister lives 2 hours away and the car's not a DeLorean tho", "No the physical driver is responsible for any and everything that happens while they are driving. The only time the owner is held liable is if they knowingly let the other person drive with out a license or under the influence.  I don't think you know how that works at all.  But OP deff is NTA and should press charges on both mom and sister!!", "That is not how things work.", "You\u2019re welcome \ud83d\ude0a have a great day", "Probably, but wouldn't be my first choice of car to move four kids around in", "If she has four kids it\u2019s likely at least one or two of them are in car seats/booster seats. I have two kids and can\u2019t fit anymore in my Subaru forester because there isn\u2019t room between their boosters and none of their friends are old enough to sit up front. \n\nAlso my kids absolutely trash my car, and I only have two kids. I knew this car would end up like a happy meal dumpster, but that\u2019s fine because it\u2019s *MY CAR* I\u2019d never expect someone else to let me borrow theirs for any amount of time to drive my two mess makers around in.", "This presumes the mother or sister has cash available to pay for a used car. The sister probably has very little money right now because divorce completely disrupts your finances and the mother may live paycheck to paycheck. We don't know. But there are 4 kids without transportation while OP's car is sitting unused for a good portion of every week. NTA but I think they should work harder to find a compromise, ie sister uses Mom's car, OP drives Mom to and from work, at least for a little while.", "Yeah a DeLorean would take 3 to 4 hours cause those cars are pieces of crap in reality, it will break down multiple times", "You're not going to see that car again if you don't. Maybe I'm just thinking the worst, but if they could steal it for 6 months, they'll steal it forever.NAT", "Oh I didn't say it's smart or the correct thing to do. Just that that's how it'd work.", "The way I cackled at this\u2026", "Bad bot", "Also, reasons like this why insurance where I live is actually tied to the driver vs. a vehicle.", "you knew a guy huh from the trust me bro school no doubt what a joker you are", "In most US jurisdictions, civil car accident liability follows the car ownership unless the car is taken without permission.  It\u2019s something that was decided pretty early on in the days of auto insurance, as a way of keeping it simple to figure out liability in an area where it\u2019s needed ridiculously often.  Car accident liability doesn\u2019t behave like most other types of liability.  And you should know better than pronouncing on an area of law on which you\u2019ve done no research, because there are all kinds of little niche areas that behave in ways that don\u2019t feel like they fit with how the majority of the system works.  Auto liability is one of those.  If you read the fine print of your car insurance contract, you\u2019ll find a clause that tells you what the conditions are for your policy to cover another driver in your car.  The last time I checked mine, I was only allowed to lend my car to any given person not on the policy 5 times, and after that, my insurance wouldn\u2019t cover them and I\u2019d be directly liable.", "There was the Jeep dealership where an employee without a license killed another technician with a Jeep that had been brought in to be serviced, and the family of that technician sued the owner of the Jeep rather than the dealership, because the law in Michigan says something about not being able to sue fellow employees for negligence while on the job.  So the Jeep owner had to sue the dealership for indemnification, and luckily won that suit. So now whatever damages the family of the dead technician win by suing the Jeep owner, which they DID, the dealership had to pay\n\nHad he not won his indemnification suit, he'd be fucked\n\nStupid as shit IMO.  Just like Bartenders are responsible if someone drives off drunk from their bar and kills someone.  Are Bartenders police? Can they detain people? Are they doctors and able to determine blood-alcohol levels? The hell are they supposed to do?  Too many dumb laws.  If you want to prevent drunk driving, stop putting parking lots at bars. That makes more sense", "Interesting, thank you! \ud83d\ude0a And good grief, that's the worst kind of enabling behavior, makes sense that she'd have to face some sort of consequence for that. Should be treated the same as handing someone a gun when they've expressed interest in killing someone.", ">care to point out one jurisdiction in the US where you assertation the owner of a nonstolen vehicle wouldn't be held liable for damages cause by who he allowed to drive?\n \nSo you're confirming your inability to find this answer.\n \nI'd like to point this out to the jury of our peers in this court of public opinion\n \nI don't blame you, I looked and couldn't find one either.", "[deleted]"]}
