For context when it comes to my sister(37), she is much older and we come from different fathers, and both grew up in split custody arrangements. We are not particularly close, almost acquaintances moreso than siblings. I dont really feel any familial connection even though I love her, I dont feel obligated to bend backward for her.\n\nWell sister lives 2 hours away (in a much more urban area) and is currently going through a divorce. Her and her ex-husband only had one vehicle and it belongs to the ex-husband, so when they split, he took the car. Sister has 4 daughters and works a full time job, I on the other hand work from home and have no real external responsibilities.\n\nMy mom came to me asking if my sister could borrow my car for a couple of months until the divorce is finalized so she has a way of transporting her and her kids to wherever they need to be without the financial burden of purchasing another car, or relying exclusively on ridesharing.\n\nI just recently bought my car('12 V8 Mustang), and its my first vehicle ever, i didnt get a hand-me-down, or get one as a present when I turned 16 or 18, I was basically immobile except occasionally being allowed to drive my moms car, or when my dad had me I could get ubers. Getting my own vehicle was extremely liberating (minus the loan), and I don't feel trapped at home, so when I was approached with this proposal I flat out said no.\n\nI can totally understand the justification for letting her use my car for a couple months, but aside from the fact I dont want to lose my newfound sense of freedom, I also just dont want someone else driving my car, and maybe thats selfish of me.\n\nOver the last few days my mom and sister have been trying to convince me to let her use the car, saying that she would pay for the car payment while she has the car, or that she'd pay for insurance if she has it longer than anticipated. No matter what they brought to the table, I kept saying no. Much to their dissatisfaction.\n\nFF to this morning, I realize that my mom isn't home. I opened our garage to see that her car was still there, but mine was not. I immediately know what has happened and call my mom about the situation. She just tries to calm me down and have me try to picture it from my sisters point of view, but im just flushed with rage and instead just tell her that im going to report the vehicle as stolen instead. She just hung up the phone.\n\nAs of now i presume my car is down with my sister, and i am seriously considering reporting it stolen and naming her and my sister as perpetrator and conspirator. I really dont want it to go that far, and I hope that we could instead work this out. But what I initially said as an angry threat, im starting to really consider as an option. I just dont know if its worth burning so many bridges over a car, but the fact that my family wont respect my boundaries or my property is so frustrating.\n\nWIBTA?", "created_utc": 1688366318, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14pb7di/wibta_for_reporting_my_mom_and_sister_for/", "score": 219, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And then, 2) if said family member took my car with permission and got into an accident, what would happen?  \n\nThen you can go back to your mom and sister and say hey I talked to my insurance company and they say that I need to report the car stolen or else such and such will happen. . .

They lit the fire, they crossed it. They own the consequences.", "Yesss this is good to have a record aswel incase anything does happen", "I\u2019m guessing you are thinking about the word policy, as who are listed on the car insurance policy and are covered by it. \n\nOP NTA - give them a short and set time to bring back your car without damage. And do not delay pressing charges past that set time.", "Not using the car much will also help it to hold its resale value.\n\nNTA, give them two hours to return the car or you\u2019ll report it as stolen. What cheek!", "Why is it on OP to make their lives easier?\n\nWhy did they not think of the consequences for their actions when they stole the car?\n\nNone of this should be on OPs shoulders. They told them no and they decided to steal the car anyways. In my opinion they've already damaged the relationship as it is. Theirs no coming back from auto theft. They burned the relationship the second they stole the keys and have refused to return the car. \n\nOP HAS to file a police report because of their sister damages the car or gets into an accident it's on OP for not filing the report and insurance will skyrocket and their rates will be insanely expensive and we all know that the other and sister are gonna pull the \"she can't afford to pay the extra money. She has to get back on her feet so she can get partial custody/full custody. And it was an accident. It's not a big deal\" even if they total the car it'll be the same narrative.\n\nIf the sister crashes the car or damages it insurance will NOT help OP because in their eyes no police report means OP gave permission even if they say otherwise.\n\nOP can't risk it. They made their beds they gotta deal with it.", "Ask your mother how yours sisters divorce is going to go with a felony on the record? Or your mothers nursing license?", "NTA, and I also have a question for your mom. If sister was able to pay the loan payments for your car while she borrowed it, why couldn't she just get her own car and make payments? I highly suspect that there would be excuses instead of payments.\n\nAlso, you don't need quotes around stealing in the title. They did steal your car, call the police.\n\nEdit to add: ignore the people saying you are liable for any wrecks she gets in. That's not how liability works.", "Well then mum could use your car and sister mum's. Then your car is not totally out of your reach.", "Report it stolen if you haven't done already. Also, how is he going to get four kids into a Mustang?", "I\u2019d go ahead and start moving. Report the car stolen and cut contact.", "Give them an hour to return your car or you're reporting it stolen. If it's not returned, make the call. \n\nWhile you wait, look for another place to live.", "The person whom the car is registered to is liable in the US. I would report the car stolen.", "In my country if they do 50+km/h, run a red light, or do a hit and run; OP is held responsible. Who was driving is never even a consideration, it\u2019s not relevant, no points deduction, just $$$", "I'm actually shocked ..the utter cheek of them, they stole your property and ignored you, they have no respect for you ..if your mom cared so much she could have given her car no matter what her excuse is ..I'd be fuming and even moreso that it's your first car and now there's gonna kids rubbish all over it( I have kids 7&9) I know exactly what they're like \ud83d\ude16", ">I\u2019m guessing you are thinking about the word policy, as who are listed on the car insurance policy and are covered by it. \n\nYes, that. Thank you! I'll edit my message. \ud83e\udd70", "Not to be rude.. but who cares if you burn bridges at this point? They pretty much dropped a bomb on the bridge when they decided that your opinion on your property is irrelevant, and stole it from you anyways. You really should not put off making a report; your mom will 100% not have your back.", "It\u2019s not missing, it\u2019s stolen. If you don\u2019t report it as such you can kiss your car goodbye. \nAlso, if I were you I would inform your mother and sister that it\u2019s classified as grand theft auto and carries prison time and fines.", "If your sister damages it you can guarantee she won\u2019t be compensating you for it, and depending on your loan and insurance arrangements, you may still be liable to pay for it. Report the car as stolen. Please let us know how you get on. \n\nThis isn\u2019t your fault. Your mum and sister and complete and utter assholes, and criminals, here. NTA", "Just report it stolen. Now. The opportunity to do the right thing has passed for them and now they face consequences.", "Nope nope nope, definitely don\u2019t report it as missing when you know it was stolen and who stole it. Like others have said, this could get you in more trouble. \n\nSend a message to both your mom and sister that if the car is not returned within 1 hour, you will be reporting it as stolen since it was taken without your permission and if there is any damage you will be reporting that as well. This way it is documented and they can\u2019t tell people you agreed and are going back on your word.", "All you\u2019d be doing is getting YOURSELF in trouble.

Civil or criminal? None of this is how law in the US works.", "Report it stolen. \n\nThey\u2019re not going to respect you either way. They haven\u2019t by taking it.

I had a friend that lost everything because they loaned their car to a friend and that friend had a wreck and killed someone.  They family of the victim sued the car owner because the driver was drunk. They won and my friend became jobless and homeless.", "United States has a myriad of jurisdictions each of which have rules for liability and duty and many are extremely fact dependent. I'm in law school. You have one anecdote from one jurisdiction that honestly seems far fetched unless there are a lot of facts being left out (like if your friend knew or should have known they were loaning to a reckless driver, etc). \n\nYou cannot determine all of US law from one thing you know about one jurisdiction. The US legal landscape is far too divided for that. I'm sorry about your friend.", "This is peak 1L content.", "Since you're a studied scholar in the field, care to point out one jurisdiction in the US where you assertation the owner of a nonstolen vehicle wouldn't be held liable for damages cause by who he allowed to drive? \n \nFor one thing, I've not seen that anywhere.\n \nFor another, that would absolve companies for any liability as it would fall on the employees that drive the vehicles.", "Just out of curiosity, how do you go about proving that a person knew they were lending their vehicle to a reckless driver? Or do you mean that they knew the person was intoxicated or was banned from driving? (I personally don't think anyone should ever lend their vehicle to anyone, too much potential liability/fallout)", "Lol I'm a 3L but reddit gets 1L specificity max. \n\nHonestly idk why I bother I just didn't want OP frightened by blanket misinformation that confuses a scenario where someone willingly lent a car with one where the car was taken without consent, and is so wrong it the parent comment suggests criminal liability and jail time.", "Respondeat superior is entirely separate from car loans. Employers being held liable for actions taken by employees within the scope of their job is an entirely separate body of law. So no, it wouldn't absolve companies. At all.\n\nInsurance may hold the owner responsible which is different than civil liability and certainly than crim. Also whether permission was given matters (here, it wasn't). My point is that law in the US is not simple nor is it a monolith like redditors pretend. I'd need to know jurisdiction and more facts and THEN could look for similar cases and jurisprudence. I know enough to never pretend to know how \"law in the US\" works for a tort, which is the comment I replied to.\n\nNow, I don't argue for free anymore so that's all I've got. I know enough to know a blanket statement is ignorant.", "Oh good question! If I'm remembering 1L torts correctly (I don't intend to dig out my notes so forgive vagueness) the case we studied was a grandmother who knew her grandson had wrecked repeated cars and frequently drove drunk. She gave him a car anyway. But that's just one case from one place so don't think of it as an overall rule."]}
