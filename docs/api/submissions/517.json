Your room mate is a slob.", "NTA, and I suspect you need a new room mate, sadly, as her response was way over the top for a request to archive shit that should be archived.", "Sounds reasonable enough, but there's something else going on here. Have you two been clashing over anything else lately? Is there other conflict going on in her life right now? Seems odd to melt down over the key plate, makes me wonder what's actually got her so high strung. \n\nGood luck OP, NTA", "NTA there isn't any need for other stuff to be put on the plate other than the keys, which I'm guessing you all agreed on. And considering that she quit the job she has no need for the lanyard and she can easily get rid off. Does she not have draws or something Jesus christ? And the other room mate how do they feel about the clutter, if I was in their shoes I'd feel irritated that I have to search for my keys on the plate because its a clutter.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

She clearly intends it for other purposes and has the right to her opinion. You aren't the AH for having your own opinion but for assuming your way is necessarily correct and, I think, for using it as a proxy for other frustrations.\n\nInstead, you need to all discuss and come up with an arrangement that works for all of you. In the end, even if this plate doesn't end up the exact way you want it, things might he pleasant overall as all of you could potentially reach an agreement about one roommate not living a lot of stuff out. If you are frustrated with the way she is operating, discuss it kindly and calmy rather than focusing on one random thing.", "She\u2019s a great roommate apart from the leaving shit laying around, and usually it really doesn\u2019t bother me, and I was very casual about asking if she would put the random stuff in her room, so I guess I\u2019m just confused as to why she got so mad. Idk. She may just be having a bad day. I\u2019ll talk to her tonight", "I\u2019ve been trying to think of anything that\u2019s happened previously that could\u2019ve upset her. Only thing I can think of is we got in a silly argument the other day about whether or not you should pull into the intersection whenever you\u2019re yielding to a green light waiting to turn. She says \u201cyes that\u2019s what you\u2019re supposed to do\u201d and I was like \u201cno man that\u2019s how you get your car t-boned\u201d .. she says everyone in her home state does it that way and I said I had never seen anyone in the state we currently live in (my home state) do that before. So I suggested she not do that here bc she will get ran over lol. \n\nOther than that, we don\u2019t ever really argue or fight.", "Also, she doesn\u2019t like furniture in her bedroom so she currently only has a nightstand. We found a dresser and I\u2019m currently sanding, staining, and refinishing it for her, but she\u2019s wanting to take the drawers out and make it a plant shelf. I think I have convinced her to keep a couple drawers to store her knick knacks in but idk.", "The other roommate isn\u2019t here much and if she did have a problem, she wouldn\u2019t say anything. She\u2019s super quiet and non-confrontational.", "I could be the asshole but it\u2019s been established that this plate is for keys. It has our spare key laying in it, it has always had all of our keys in it. She\u2019s just recently started collecting other things in it and it\u2019s getting piled up. \n\nI\u2019m gonna try to talk to her about it, but she just doesn\u2019t see an issue with leaving things laying around. She likes clutter and that\u2019s fine, but I just wish she would keep it confined to her room more.", "As others have noted, there's likely more going on, and it may not be even appropriate for you to delve. What you can do is check-in, and make sure that your roommate understands that the request wasn't unreasonable, and won't be unreasonable the next time she leaves something in the common area that she's no longer using (again, not including decor you've all put in place.)", "Jesus christ, at this point you 3, or at the very least you 2, should sit down and set boundaries and consequences for failing to respect them. Like a 3 strikes your out type or at least a convention, if that's the right word, and spend a few minutes discussing you're feelings and why it's affecting you and how your day to day life is affected.", "Was it established that she shouldn\u2019t put anything else there? If so, that would change my vote.", "Yeah, this is the best course of action. And one of the very first things I told her before she even moved in was that I liked order in shared spaces. I told her I don\u2019t care what her room looks like but I appreciate if things are put away in shared spaces. So she\u2019s known this. I probably have just let it slide too long, but I didn\u2019t wanna come out of the gate being a bitch when she just moved in. So it could be mostly my fault for establishing this in the beginning.", "I mean we never made a hard rule that you shouldn\u2019t use the key plate as a crow collection, but I also asked nicely she would move it. I wasn\u2019t like \u201cget your shit out of this plate right fucking now\u201d I just said the plate was getting cluttered. Then she got mad.", "Ok, so maybe it should be ESH if she reacted in a mean way, but it seems like you are not just asking. If you were just asking she could say no and that would be that.\n\nI'm not saying your desire (keys only on the plate) isn't reasonable. I'm just saying you don't just get to assume that's the way to do things. There all sorts of ways to effectively run a house. She doesn't seem to be doing that overall, but then have a roommate conversation about that rather than just assuming the right to your way on this one issue."]}
