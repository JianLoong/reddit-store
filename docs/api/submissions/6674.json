I wont go into detail, but basically, they needed a place to stay. I opened my door to them, and said they could stay with me, which my mom reluctantly agreed to.\n\nThe first night went really well. However when I woke up, they were still asleep in the other room. I was gonna practice for a smash bros tournament I have coming up, but when  I went to grab my controller, I couldn't find it. I hadn't touched it in awhile, so I know I didnt leave it somewhere else. So I did something I'm not proud of, and I searched my friends bag. Not only did I find my controller, I found other stuff they took from my sister. I didnt know what else to do, so I grabbed our stuff and hid it. I didnt bring this up to them, as I could tell the moment they checked their bag and saw me and my sisters stuff gone, they knew.\n\nHonestly, I could've gotten over that, but last night I went to the guest room to check on them, and they werent in the room, but their phone was. I didnt mean to read the text conversation they were having but I did. It was them talking shit about me. Despite all I did for them here and in the past, they were talking shit about me.\n\nSo this morning, I confronted them, it went something like this\n\nOP - Me\nF - Friend\n\nOP: hey, you need to find somewhere else to stay\n\nF: What? Why?\n\nOP: You being here is really stressing my mom out, and we just cant have you here anymore (not particularly a lie, my mom was really stressed)\n\nF: Can I talk to her? Maybe make a deal with her?\n\nOP: This isnt up for debate F, I'm sorry, you need to leave by tonight\n\nF: Why wont you just let me talk to her??\n\nWe argued for minutes before I just snapped, and said\n\nOP: You cant stay because you stole from me and you talk shit about me behind my back, despite all i did for you\n\nThere was silence for a few moments before I told them to pack up their stuff and get out\n\nDespite all that they did to me, I still did read a private conversation and searched their bag. Its been killing me all day.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1673036129, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10548hu/aita_for_kicking_my_friend_out_of_my_house_after/", "score": 99, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

However, you are right for not letting to be disrespected in your own home. You helped your friend out and they were just using your kindness.", "NTA \n\nStealing shit isn\u2019t cool.\n\nThough he\u2019s a minor and if he was \u2018kicked out\u2019 of his own place, child protective services in your area should be made aware", "NTA, but I hope you checked F's bag before he left", "NTA.\n\nKid is stealing and talking crap while begging to squat at your house?\n\nAlso, have to wonder why he was kicked out as a minor from his own home.", "NTA. Your \"friend\" took advantage of your hospitality and stole from you and insulted you. They aren't your friend and aren't deserving of your help.", "NTA. He stole from you and you'd have never seen your stuff again had he made it out of the house with the stuff before you discovered it. He likely could have gone on for more days until you noticed more stuff was gone.  Now I'm sure the dudes life is shit and he may be stealing as a way to survive, but that's not your problem. He needs more help than your family can afford to provide.", "NTA; you\u2019ll learn that the biggest downfall of having a big, compassionate heart like that, is that we assume everyone else has one too. You protected yourself, and your sister, and although the guilt of having to kick your friend out may eat at you, could you imagine what could\u2019ve happened had you not stood your ground? This was a hard situation and I\u2019m proud of how you handled it, at 15 nonetheless; you\u2019re both young, and the thought of impending homelessness may hav clouded your friends judgement. There is always room for growth, especially so young. NTA", "NTA. Your friend is a big asshole though.", "NTA for kicking them out. Stealing is absolutely not okay, a horrible return for what you were doing for your friend. But reading their texts wasn't cool. Not sure how you \"accidentally\" picked up their phone and read their texts. The bag searching, well, I dunno. Kinda sketchy but also kinda justified. This person shouldn't be staying with your family.", "NTA. While generally I\u2019d say don\u2019t look in other peoples bags, you had a gut feeling he was stealing and you were right. I would kick him out for just the stealing let alone talking shit about you.", "So light NTA given the entire situation and the friend stealing, but you shouldn't read other people's messages.\n\nIn this case it worked out and you need to get that toxic friend out of your life. \n\nAs much as it might be nice to help, it's not your issue to solve. They have parents or guardians that is there job, if not social services.\n\nAlso your mum definately was put in an awkward situation and going forwards maybe consider her a bit more before your friend.\n\nFriends come and go, but you only get one mum.", "NTA. You welcomed him in your home and he tried to steal from you. You should have called the police.", "no. NTA.\n\ni had something similar happen to me. Friend lost her place to live, she had a baby with her and another friend. i offered them a place in my room; my dad reluctantly agreed. she moves in, treats me like her baby sitter, talks shit in front of me to the other girl(they both speak spanish, while i don't, but could understand my/your house and dad, and that she was talking shit about me opening my door, and how its my dads house not mine, so she doesn't have to give a shit about me) girl was incredibly toxic, she almost gave her daughter brain damage after she had a phone call/fight with baby daddy and threw her phone at my BRICK WALL, which left a chip and her found bounced back, landing inches from her babies head. i grabbed that baby and let the other girl yell at her. \n\nwell, months go by like this(im a pushover, and they took advantage of that, the other girl was fine-she'd check up on me and stand up for me when the friend was trash talking me) and finally the girl finds another friend to live with-my dad had said they need to leave, cause leaving the house unlocked, and them constantly trashing the house/not cleaning up after themselves was stressing him.\n\ni found out she's been trash talking me to other friends, who i've know longer than she has, so they don't believe her, but stay friends cause they're worried about the little girl. She ended up doing the same thing to this other friend that let her in her house, until she was deported from the country. girls mother never did the right paperwork for her so she graduated HS illegal, but she somehow found a place to live in canada and i refuse to acknowledge her existence. We don't need toxic people like that in our lives. \n\nIf you open the door for someone and they treat you like crap, or you find them stealing from you; they're the AH. not you.", "YTA for not kicking them out the moment you found they were stealing from your family.\n\nYou obviously knew them well enough to search their  bag.\n\nYou also should not have claimed it was your mom kicking them out.  They need to know why they were being kicked out.  \n\nThey are not your friend.", "ESH. When your parents are reluctant to agree to something, it's usually wise to say no. It was the \"nice\" thing, but it's their house. \n\nAs for snooping, people snoop when they suspect something, and you suspected something. You aren't an AH for that. \n\nStop talking to this person, they're bad news and not someone who's a real friend.

Slightly YTA for only doing it after seeing they were saying mean things about you. Should have kicked him out as soon as you found out he was stealing from not just you, but your whole family.", "NTA.  Those were both good things to do, because they allowed you to catch him.", "NTA.They were a guest but tried to steal from you and talked shit about you. So they can figure it out.", "Meh, clearly your friend was an AH for stealing and shit-talking. You are NTA but you were out of your depth and kept trying to go it alone. You failed by pressing your mom to take your friend in, something that your family wasn't well-equipped to do. You failed by not confronting your friend about the theft, by reading their texts, and by making it sound like your Mom was the one that wanted him out that night. You failed by not getting adult help for yourself and by not trying to connect your friend with adult help. \n\nIn future, seek guidance and resources for yourself and others. There are lots of adults with experience and resources to help teens in situations like your friend and like you. Keep nurturing that generous heart of yours and learn to reach out for help.", "NTA. You took this AH into your home and within 24 hours they had stolen from you. Kick them the heck out.", "NTA, he betrayed your trust and that is not cool. You were entitled to read that after the theft.", "Absolutely NTA. How disrespectful can you be to take advantage of someone helping you? I'm glad you figured it out, seems like they've done it before if you checked his bag. Let him rob those other 'friends'", "YTA for invading into someone else's privacy both times BUT you had justifiable reason for looking into their bag but not cool for looking through their phone. just not cool. \n\nyour friend is also an AH for doing that to you when you're providing them a place to stay.", "ESH - but mostly the friend\n\nSearching their stuff and going through their phone are not acceptable activities, regardless of whether you were right or not. Privacy is a thing.\n\nThat said, theft and shit-talking are both absolutely AH moves. Considering getting kicked out at 15, though, it sounds like things are really shitty for the friend and the stealing might be a symptom of other issues.", "That could make things worse, definitely wouldn\u2019t be my first suggestion either. CPC can make some bad calls and send a 15 year old boy into an even worse situation", "That played into my decision. I value my mom alot more then any of my friends", "So why are you saying he\u2019s the asshole? He said he checked the bag as a last resort, probably one of those \u201che couldn\u2019t of, could he\u201d moments", "Having a 15y/o kid on the streets who is clearly in trouble at home is worth the call.", "Not an ass for checking the bag.  For not escorting him out of the house when he found his sister's stuff.  \nPutting his family's property at risk.", "That\u2019s why I said my first suggestion. Now i would definitely do it but would your immediate thought as a 15yr old be \u201csend him away with strangers\u201d? Of course we don\u2019t know why the friend was kicked out to begin with, so maybe it would\u2019ve been", "Agreed", "NTA kick them out they aren't your friends", "NTA I can see why they got kicked out. His parents are assholes because he is 15", "NTA !! U need to understand that is not ur friend stay away from him he might create some drama for u but ur better off without him in ur life I get it\u2019s hard in high school but u will see none of these people are ganna mean anything to u in the next 5 years", "And whT kind of sisters stuff?! Is thus kids a perv stealing underwear??"]}
