She also likes to sit around the same space as me, which I don't really mind cause it's a sharing service. Coming onto the problem part, she likes to hog seats. Every time I would get in the coster in the morning, she would go on with, \"Don't sit beside me, it's for my friend. Not even the same row alpha beta and gamma are supposed to sit here(mind it, these people are not yet in the coster). The seat behind her? Nah, she wants her other friend to sit there.\" \n\nI am usually very patient and don't like to argue, but she presses me the wrong way with her useless rants every morning. So 2 weeks ago, while she didn't let me sit next to her, I told her that this was the last time I would accommodate her and that the next time, I won't take it.\nI got WFH for 1 week after that, and when I went back on monday, there she was with her usual shenanigans. She had her bag and some other stuff around to hold the seats for her friends, and I told her to move it since I wanted to sit. She refused to do so. \n\nThe convo was like;\nHer: \"I am a professor. My friends keep the seat for me on the way back. Why is it wrong for me to do the same?\" \n\nMe: \"Two wrong, don't make one right. I get that you are a professor, but in here, you are not entitled to any special benefits, and we have talked about this before. Please move your things as I need to sit here.\"\n\nHer: \" You are so disrespectful to a PROFESSOR and don't know the manners to sit with me.\"\n\nMe(Fuming at this point): \"I am baffled at the audacity of your entitlement, and just cause you are a professor doesn't mean I have to treat you differently. Why don't you start a class about manners. Though I think no one would benefit from it given that you'd be the instructor, and I wouldn't want to lose my bucks on a useless course anyway.\"\n\nRegardless to say she huffed and puffed and ended up going a seat back. \n\nYesterday, I told this to my mother, who scolded me and is telling me that I was an AH and should apologise to her next time I see her. I don't believe I did anything wrong, but my mother is very adamant that I should apologise. So people AITA?\n\nEDIT: So, I feel like I should add that this problem started pretty recently. We were very civil before and even sat together multiple times. She had requested to be dropped first, but the van service said that it makes their route difficult. She then told me that I should essentially get off at a stop earlier and walk to the office. Mind it, it's a 15-minute walk from that stop, which I politely said no to since it was between the van service and me. And no, those are not her friends, just random people she would rather sit with than me. \nThe reason I want to sit up front is not cause of my liking to a certain seat but cause of many people who have complained that they have to get up to give me the way when I get off. I just didn't want to make everyone stand to give me way.

I use to be in a wine club and took a coworker.   She kept telling everyone she had a PhD.   One of my good friends came up to me later and told me he didn't want to burst her bubble but he had 2.  She didn't get invited back.  And my friend and I laughed.", "As someone who has a PhD and does teach at a university, I agree with this. To crystallize the reasoning for people who aren't sure why it's AH behaviour, it's this: titles are used to confer status in specific contexts. In a hospital, being referred to as 'doctor' or 'nurse' might be important because there's a hierarchy of functions, responsibilities, expertise, etc. and so in that sense, being referred to as a doctor matters to cement the position with which the person has in that context. Calling someone a professor at university is often part of the teacher-student dynamic and is used to confer respect.\n\n\nOutside of those specific social contexts, people are generally of equal social standing. Like, if I (someone who has a PhD in Media Studies) asks for special attention while in line at Burger King in contrast to someone else, I'd be TA because the PhD means nothing relevant to Burger King, I am the same as every other customer there. I think this is true of most other qualifications, I also don't think someone who had an MD should be entitled to special treatment at Burger King if they aren't actively practising medicine inside the restaurant. People who try to use their degrees to get their way when their degrees are not relevant to the situation are akin to people who might try to use Monopoly money to pay for a meal at a restaurant -- Monopoly money has a specific role for a specific context (which is playing a board game) and is useless outside of that context.", "Exactly, the only time where you\u2019re maybe obligated to call someone doctor is in a situation where their doctorate is relevant.

They're the head authority there, no matter who is on board.", "I get it lol.", "NTA. She's causing unnecessary drama for bs reasons. And trying to force you into an necessary 15 minute walk?

Many people might be willing to do that so that you don't have to make others move when you get off. Maybe even the driver might be able to help problem solve something so it's less of a problem for anyone who is inconvienced by anyone getting off first. I am sure that there is always situations on ride shares where someone has to get off and the others have to move. And that there are also solutions some people have found.
