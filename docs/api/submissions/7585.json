About 3 months ago due I got a pickndrop service to commute to work. Now, to describe the service, they pick people up from their homes and drop them at the destinations, just like Uber Pool. My dropout stop is the very first, so I prefer to sit near the door of the coster. \n\nThere is this female professor from a university who also uses the same van service as me. She also likes to sit around the same space as me, which I don't really mind cause it's a sharing service. Coming onto the problem part, she likes to hog seats. Every time I would get in the coster in the morning, she would go on with, \"Don't sit beside me, it's for my friend. Not even the same row alpha beta and gamma are supposed to sit here(mind it, these people are not yet in the coster). The seat behind her? Nah, she wants her other friend to sit there.\" \n\nI am usually very patient and don't like to argue, but she presses me the wrong way with her useless rants every morning. So 2 weeks ago, while she didn't let me sit next to her, I told her that this was the last time I would accommodate her and that the next time, I won't take it.\nI got WFH for 1 week after that, and when I went back on monday, there she was with her usual shenanigans. She had her bag and some other stuff around to hold the seats for her friends, and I told her to move it since I wanted to sit. She refused to do so. \n\nThe convo was like;\nHer: \"I am a professor. My friends keep the seat for me on the way back. Why is it wrong for me to do the same?\" \n\nMe: \"Two wrong, don't make one right. I get that you are a professor, but in here, you are not entitled to any special benefits, and we have talked about this before. Please move your things as I need to sit here.\"\n\nHer: \" You are so disrespectful to a PROFESSOR and don't know the manners to sit with me.\"\n\nMe(Fuming at this point): \"I am baffled at the audacity of your entitlement, and just cause you are a professor doesn't mean I have to treat you differently. Why don't you start a class about manners. Though I think no one would benefit from it given that you'd be the instructor, and I wouldn't want to lose my bucks on a useless course anyway.\"\n\nRegardless to say she huffed and puffed and ended up going a seat back. \n\nYesterday, I told this to my mother, who scolded me and is telling me that I was an AH and should apologise to her next time I see her. I don't believe I did anything wrong, but my mother is very adamant that I should apologise. So people AITA?\n\nEDIT: So, I feel like I should add that this problem started pretty recently. We were very civil before and even sat together multiple times. She had requested to be dropped first, but the van service said that it makes their route difficult. She then told me that I should essentially get off at a stop earlier and walk to the office. Mind it, it's a 15-minute walk from that stop, which I politely said no to since it was between the van service and me. And no, those are not her friends, just random people she would rather sit with than me. \nThe reason I want to sit up front is not cause of my liking to a certain seat but cause of many people who have complained that they have to get up to give me the way when I get off. I just didn't want to make everyone stand to give me way.

Apparently your mom is thinking of professors like some kind of demi-gods (like they were seen before the fifties). And this lady professor you are dealing with still thinks of herself and her class this way. You were correct in how your discussed her behaviour with this professor.
