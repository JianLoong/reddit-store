Twoish years ago, I painted a kind of raunchy picture for my partner as a gift.  If you remember that trend where people painted the backs of their legs and butt and sat on a canvas- that's what I did.  It's a big, about 24x36\" canvas that has my asscheeks painted on it.  He hadn't hung it up yet, but it's been sitting propped up against the wall in his man cave, the back of it facing out so no one could see the painting, since we just moved in and are still unpacking.\n\nIt was his mother's bday a few weeks ago. We went out to dinner to celebrate, and my partner invited them over to our house after the dinner to show off our place.  The group consisted of his mom, stepfather, 2 sisters, sister's boyfriend, and his stepbrother.\n\nHis sisters and stepbrother weren't super interested in a tour since they helped us move in and had already seen the place, so he was showing his mom and stepdad around.\n\nI was out in the living room with everyone else when his stepdad walks in, holding my painting like it is a trophy. Everyone explodes into laughter, and his stepdad keeps making jokes about the fact I painted it for my partner.  They're talking about my butt and how weird/awkward it is I did that. His sister kept yelling  and was laughing so hard she almost cried. My partner follows, laughing, saying, \"I told them no, but they don't listen.\" My partner's siblings are 14, 17, and 19, and I burst into tears and ran into the kitchen to hide because I felt embarrassed.\n\nThey ended up leaving not long after, and I was bawling in the kitchen. His stepdad was laughing and said, \"sorry if I crossed any boundaries,\" but he didn't say it to me, he said it to my partner. I told my partner I never wanted to spend time with his family because of how they embarrassed me from here on out, and that I would only see them on the holidays I absolutely had to.\n\nThis didn't make my partner very happy. I think when he realized I was serious and NOT just accepting his stepfather's \"sorry,\" he began to get defensive.  He was saying that people would've seen it anyway if it was hung up, and what, was he supposed to take it down every time he had guests? When I tried to explain it wasn't about that, it just ended with him saying, \"this can just be a wash.\" He says he can't change his family, and I know how they are, so I need to adjust to how they make me feel so I can handle them in the future.\n\nAITA/WIBTA for making that decision and sticking to it because of this incident? I understand it is his family, and he probably feels like I am attacking them personally... but I just am embarrassed. :(\n\nEDIT: Some clarifying info, he has never hung it up anywhere before moving into our house, because he said he didn't know what he was supposed to do with it. I know it was made for people to see, and I wouldn't have cared if they had seen it hanging up, but it was the way his family went about it that makes me feel so icky.", "created_utc": 1694803631, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16jlehp/aitawibta_for_refusing_to_spend_time_with_my/", "score": 911, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your partner should have gotten you together, there should have been mumbled apologies, end of story. \n\nAnd my guess is, even if you had thought about it, you wouldn't have expected a gang up up people taunting you about it, as opposed to some snickers and such with the painting on the wall. There is a big difference between you having the painting up and being like \"oh yes, here is this ridiculous thing I did, we can all laugh\" and it being found lying around and paraded out for group torment. \n\nYou can absolutely own the \"well you did make it to be displayed\" part of this and also still be upset that even when you ran away in tears, no one pulled it together to comfort you? To be like- sorry, too far? Your partner had no reaction to his entire family making you cry? I'd be pissed too.", "There's a difference between a painting hanging in a mancave (I would have hung such a personal painting in the privacy of my bedroom), and people saying something about it, \n\n*versus* \n\nFIL CARRYING IT TO THE LIVING AREA SO THE WHOLE FAMILY COULD MAKE FUN OF IT.\n\nYes, that's disrespectful and icky.\n\nNTA", "NTA. \n\nThe point you\u2019re trying to make is not that his family saw it, it\u2019s that they made fun of you. Excessively. & your boyfriend didn\u2019t even stand up for you, he laughed with them. \n\nThe fact that the stepdad even thought it was okay to bring it out to SHOW EVERYONE - is such an overstep in someone else\u2019s home. You had it put away & you flipped around so the back was showing. \n\nThat\u2019s humiliating, & heartbreaking.", "I feel like a lot of people are willfully ignoring the fact that this clearly isn't about being embarrassed about the painting itself. It's that the family decided, in OP's home, to have a group session mocking her. I have a feeling if this were on the wall and someone made an offhand joke about it, it wouldn't result in OP wanting to go NC if it wasn't done in a mean-spirited way. But everybody howling laughing at her is just mean and rude, and honestly if the BF doesn't get that I don't really think it's a great sign for their future together. Having group sessions bashing people, especially if what they did is just a bit silly, is just trashy, disrespectful behavior. BF could have shut it down and did not. \n\nNTA, OP, and don't take it to heart the people who are telling you otherwise, regardless of the merits of the painting itself. This sort of behavior is what bullies do, and it's not justified whether or not you ever hung it up or what the painting was of.", "ESH. Your boyfriend's stepdad absolutely shouldn't have brought out the painting for everyone to make fun of, and the family's reaction was excessive. They owe you an apology. That said, if you're going to make - and eventually, hang up and display - a painting of your own ass cheeks in your home, you have to have thicker skin than this.", "Info: please correct me if I'm wrong, OP, but it's not that they saw it nor even didn't like it, but instead of just saying it wasn't for them, they chose to ridicule you; is that what's bothering you?", "NTA\n\nI see a lot of people saying E-S-H, because, yeah, people will eventually see the painting. However, they loudly and purposefully mocked you. It\u2019s one thing to be okay with people seeing the art, it\u2019s another thing to be okay with people mocking you", "NTA- and honestly run, if they DGAF about being respectful now it won't get better and you OF clearly won't stand up to them. Leave and find a partner that has your back", "NTA\n\nparading around a spicy gift you gave your partner is VERY uncool. imagine he left a tasteful nude of you on him phone and his stepdad did the same thing. absolutely mortifying. lots of people give their partners sexy gifts that are just for them. forever ago i was watching a documentary about a fancy house in the middle ages, and there was a sexy mural of the wife in the bedroom behind a tapestry. it was hidden for the husbands eyes only. \n\nif i were you i would consider hiding/removing/destroying/giving away the painting. your partner clearly doesnt know what to do with it, and wont stand up for you about it.\n\nthe amount of victim blaming in this thread is unreal", "NTA. Yeah, you painted it. But it had been put away this whole time and you hadn\u2019t decided what to do with it yet. Your boyfriend took away your opportunity to own it. The empowering part of doing something like this is to be able to decide how you want to display it. It was unexpected. Your bf wanted to brag or embarrass you or whatever. They suck.", "NTA. They intentionally hurt your feelings and your boyfriend did nothing. So many red flags here. If you can't stand his family it's better to end the relationship because he is one of them. You will always be the second after them. He loved it to you. Don't wait until you have children. It will be worse to get out.", "NTA. i\u2019ve made that painting, i know what to expect if we have guests or family in our house. \n\ni would NOT expect his father to carry it around and giggling at it to the point of tears. i would 1000% not be okay with that. and to top it off, if i was crying and embarrassed and upset, if my bf laughed with them and then turned it around on me, i\u2019d be sleeping on someone else\u2019s couch until he understands that it\u2019s not okay. it\u2019s not a \u201cwhat do you expect\u201d because i\u2019d expect my bf to stick up for ne", "NTA.\n\n Just because you see someone in a thong bikini does not mean you can critique their body. \n\nIf someone makes art for personal use, you don't make fun of it in their home in front of their face. ( or behind their back if you're a decent human). \n\nWhat you did was make a personal peice of art that reflects your body. \n\nWhat they did was disgusting and rude. \n\nYou deserve an apology and they need to learn \" if you can't say something nice...shut the fuck up about other people's body's and art\"\n\nAnd I am sorry but \n\n>My partner follows, laughing, saying, \"I told them no, but they don't listen\n\nGives me 0 faith he will sand up for you at all.

You come first.", "I'm going with NTA here. I mean yes, you might have expected some ridicule after having made a painting like that, BUT the way they went about it is absolutely not OK. I mean, you don't just grab a painting that's been put somewhere in someone's private home, facing the wall, and drag it around the house screaming with laughter. That's just not OK.   \nI can see why you're upset. I'd be, too. You're in a tricky situation now. I don't think it's realistic to never want to see them again if you want to stay with this guy. Perhaps you should discuss with them how the way they handled this made you feel - if you think they'd be prepared to listen. Then again, your partner should have your back, and he doesn't. Someone else stated that's a red flag and I agree. Something to think about.   \nI wish you good luck. And wisdom.", "NTA tbh i have the same picture (painted it for decor in my stairway) and would be livid and kick someone out of my house if they dare make fun of it. Fuck em", "NTA. if he feels like YOU need to change how you deal with stuff, hes refusing to see how his family can be wrong. if you stay together, itll only continue to happen with bigger things.

He knew what would happen, and he did it anyways. His sorry is just hypocrisy.\n\nNTA", "Take your painting back and leave. Your BF doesn't deserve you. Don't let this go. It's how everything will go in the future.", "nta. the relationship is over...you guys just haven't figured that out. His family is trash and he is defending them..start your exit strategy...", "For some reason this reminds me of when little kids find a frog; poke it until it dies and then are shocked that the frog is in fact a living thing that had the capacity to die from its cruel punishment. I mean ya OP can expect a few taunts about having a funny painting but this it a bit to the extreme and quite mean spirited.", "He doesn\u2019t have the guts to stand up to his teenaged siblings? Dump him", "NTA\n\nFor me it doesn\u2019t matter about the painting\u2014 it is how they were *mean* about it.  And then when it was obvious that they upset you, they doubled down and didn\u2019t even offer an sincere apology. \n\nIf a joke is made at the expense of another person who doesn\u2019t find the joke funny and actually hurtful\u2014 everyone else is an asshole and/or bully.", "NTA..for getting upset that your boyfriend cur'd out and didn't stand up for you it makes no difference on whether they all would have seen it eventually or not it's about how his stepdad did it on purpose to cause a scene and then didn't apologize to you directly just glossed over the issue and your boyfriend just accepted it like see I told you it was funny and if your hurt welp that's just how he is..and the stepdad coming out of the room like hey everyone look what i found while snooping around because \"you say the painting wasn't facing out it was towards the wall\", so he knew what he was doing and your boyfriend seems immature about it like oops i don't wanna cause a scene. But I'll laugh at you about it.", "NTA. You knew that people were going to see the painting when it was eventually hung on the wall. What you didn\u2019t expect was your partners family to completely tear it apart and say offensive things about your body. You have every right to be upset and I would expect an apology too.", "Well, I would absolutely destroy the painting and give some thought to your relationship. Do you want to be a part of this family? Do you want to be with a partner who mocks and laughs at you with his family as they're humiliating you?", "ESH\n\nYeah, they were being jerks.\n\nBut did you really expect to have a print of your bare ass on the wall and have *nobody* comment on it? Did you expect your BF to think to say \"oh, no, that's just something funny I found online\" \n\nI'd tend to think that if my SO did something like that and hung up the painting, they would expect hilarity to ensue at some point. I would expect that hilarity to involve some self-deprecating humor. Otherwise, why even put it up?", "NTA. It was immature and out of line for the step father to take the painting when it was hidden away then humiliate you \n\nSome of the YTA comments though\u2026.Even if I find some art questionable or not akin to my taste, I wouldn\u2019t go into someone\u2019s home and straight up mock and insult the art or photos they have hanging on their walls", "You can tell which comments are men. NTA", "NTA and honestly that fact that your partner just ignored how you felt is a huge red flag, and it's a preview how it'll look every time your feelings are hurt. \n\nI'd honestly re-think if this is what you want from your future partner.", "NTA. <hugs> \n\nI think you may feel right now as though you never want to spend time with them again, but that may pass. Definitely, the step-dad owes an apology. And your partner (sorry to have to type this) may want to stand by you in this decision for now... Who wouldn't be so hurt by this. Ouch.", "If anyone is the ah here, it's the boyfriend. He should have shut his family down, and comments about your body never should have been made", "NTA, but dump his ass and take the canvas with you.\n\nHe just showed his true self and his complete lack of respect for you and his refusal to defend you against his family.  He even joined in to a point.\n\nHe will ALWAYS put you last and will never have your back.  \n\nEXIT now!!", "Nta, what step dad did was creepy at best....", ">that trend where people painted the backs of their legs and butt and sat on a canvas- that's what I did.\n\nWhat now? When did this happen?", "NTA and I can't believe there are y t a votes lol but what do I expect from reddit? \n\n'It's ok to mock and ridicule you if you painted a picture, it's art now and that makes you open to any and all mockery from all comers', that's what you guys sound like.", "NTA\n\nbut\n\n\"If you remember that trend where people painted the backs of their legs and butt and sat on a canvas- that's what I did.\"\n\nNoooo? When was this a trend?", "Tentative NTA. \n\nlook, it was a somewhat funny thing to happen...but it stopped being funny the moment you were genuinely upset about it, and a good boyfriend would have recognised that and shut it down on the spot. So, I'm sorry that happened.\n\n\nThis next bit...I wish I could say it to your boyfriend, but here goes:\n\nYou are going to lose your relationship with this woman if you don't fix this, and fix it now. As things stand, what's going to happen is that your family are going to harass her until she dumps you. Oh, they won't admit that it's harassment, they'll just say it's funny...but they will also never, ever stop. They will never, ever let it be one funny/embarrassing thing that happened, they will continue to give her shit about it every time the family interacts, unless you go the fuck over there and lay down the law.\n\nIf you don't wanna be with this woman, then break up with her. Now. Today.\nBut if you do want to stay in a relationship with her, then you need to go to your family and clearly communicate that it happened, it was funny, but she's really embarrassed, and you NEED them to fucking drop it.\n\nAnd if they won't? If your family won't listen to you? Then I guess you're a sap and a weakling. Find some balls, find some *knuckles*, and make them listen.\n\n\nEDIT: and, this is for you, OP. If he does the above, if he actually goes over and sorts his family out, then if YOU want to keep the relationship, you'll eventually need to risk seeing them again. Maybe start with his mum alone, hmmmm?", "NTA\n\nRegardless if you painted something like that, it wasn't set out to be shown (it was facing the wall) and stepdad went out of his way to snoop and then proceed do a little show and tell and make fun of your body. Your partner sucks as does his family. The stepdad owes you an apology to YOU not your partner, if he can even be called that.  The fact you're crying doesn't seem to get it through any of them it was not okay shows what kind of people they are.\n\nAlso it sounds like you didn't forbid your partner from visiting them, just that you yourself would not interact unless a holiday.\n\nI would consider if you really want to be saddled with this family for the long term, because I'm guessing this won't be the last time they make fun of it and do you have the tolerance to endure potentially the same behavior repeatedly?", "NTA\n\nOn the start of the topic and reading I was feeling like your boyfriend when I saw where this was going as far as his family seeing it.... that sort of thing is just one of life's cringes that can take time to get over but not enough, IMO, to cut contact.  Maybe just some blush-diminishing time.  \n\n\nBut tthhheennn I got to how they acted.  And then how your boyfriend acted.  \n\n\nYou are so very NTA for not wanting to be around these people.  \nFrankly, I wouldn't want to be around your boyfriend again after he let it go on and then now, later, after time to think about maybe handling it wrong \\*still\\* is telling you to take their treatment.  \n\n\nYou're right - them seeing it isn't the problem and your partner should understand that.  And support you, even if it didn't mean not seeing them again then standing on your side and putting them in their place about it.  \n\n\nHow they treated you is not acceptable.  It wasn't accidental, it wasn't an in-the-moment wrong comment, it was bullying and picking-on that was obviously upsetting to you (can exactly miss someone breaking into tears...).  \n\n\nEspecially if they know you.  I assume since your partner feels you know how they are then it follows there's been enough time for them to know how you are.  \n\n\nOnly other details that \\*does\\* not land on you is:   Are you going to be an AH to yourself and put up with this?    \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNot just his family - HIM.\n\nBecause you \\*do\\* know what his family is like and are now looking to act on how they make you feel, how they'll treat you.  \n\n\nAre you going to be good and frank with yourself about what you know he is like and how he'll treat you?   Because long-term this sort of behavior by them WILL come up again... and again.... and.... as years and years go on with you two together.  \n\n\nIf you intend to stay with him then you actively accept his behavior, too.

Twoish years ago, I painted a kind of raunchy picture for my partner as a gift.  If you remember that trend where people painted the backs of their legs and butt and sat on a canvas- that's what I did.  It's a big, about 24x36\" canvas that has my asscheeks painted on it.  He hadn't hung it up yet, but it's been sitting propped up against the wall in his man cave, the back of it facing out so no one could see the painting, since we just moved in and are still unpacking.\n\nIt was his mother's bday a few weeks ago. We went out to dinner to celebrate, and my partner invited them over to our house after the dinner to show off our place.  The group consisted of his mom, stepfather, 2 sisters, sister's boyfriend, and his stepbrother.\n\nHis sisters and stepbrother weren't super interested in a tour since they helped us move in and had already seen the place, so he was showing his mom and stepdad around.  \n\nI was out in the living room with everyone else when his stepdad walks in, holding my painting like it is a trophy. Everyone explodes into laughter, and his stepdad keeps making jokes about the fact I painted it for my partner.  They're talking about my butt and how weird/awkward it is I did that. His sister kept yelling  and was laughing so hard she almost cried. My partner follows, laughing, saying, \"I told them no, but they don't listen.\" My partner's siblings are 14, 17, and 19, and I burst into tears and ran into the kitchen to hide because I felt embarrassed.\n\nThey ended up leaving not long after, and I was bawling in the kitchen. His stepdad was laughing and said, \"sorry if I crossed any boundaries,\" but he didn't say it to me, he said it to my partner. I told my partner I never wanted to spend time with his family because of how they embarrassed me from here on out, and that I would only see them on the holidays I absolutely had to.\n\nThis didn't make my partner very happy. I think when he realized I was serious and NOT just accepting his stepfather's \"sorry,\" he began to get defensive.  He was saying that people would've seen it anyway if it was hung up, and what, was he supposed to take it down every time he had guests? When I tried to explain it wasn't about that, it just ended with him saying, \"this can just be a wash.\" He says he can't change his family, and I know how they are, so I need to adjust to how they make me feel so I can handle them in the future.\n\nAITA/WIBTA for making that decision and sticking to it because of this incident? I understand it is his family, and he probably feels like I am attacking them personally... but I just am embarrassed. :(\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That you hoped he would accept in that same loving spirit.  If he didn't like it, he could have said so.  That would have been disappointing, but not nearly as traumatic as the passive aggressive nastiness you were exposed to. It almost sounds like he encouraged their mocking. That he was on THEIR side, shaking his head and saying, \"I know! What in the hell was she thinking?\", and that's probably what hurts the most.  He ridiculed it by letting them ridicule it. Yes they are bullies and awful people but your real problem is that you have a partner who thinks so little of your efforts to create a sexy, heartfelt gift for him.  He is NOT careful with your heart. Let this be a wake up call. If a person is not careful with your heart, they will inevitably break it.  Maybe get out before he breaks it worse than this?

To add my two cents:\n\nTo the point of owning the \"artwork is meant to be displayed\" part of this ordeal, there's a difference between intentionally hanging a picture and knowing upfront people would see and someone finding it. OP says the painting was somewhere that wouldn't necessarily be seen (unless someone picked it up to check what it was) when the family visited so its reasonable to feel violated by the way the step-dad's went about blasting the painting to everyone and making a huge deal of it. \n\nAs already stated, the moment OP burst into tears and left the room, all the teasing should have stopped and genuine apologies to OP (not the bf) should have been issued. Even if the family thought it was \"harmless teasing\" and wouldn't cry if they were in OP's shoes, clearly not everyone has the same sort of humor or tolerance for being the butt of the joke. \n\nI'd be on the lookout for other \"this is just how it is\" behavior that feels belittling or invalidating.", "This should be the top comment, honestly.

Not seeing them ever again sounds a bit unreasonable. Maybe they got the point and will check themselves before taking another jab at something about you that they find funny. \n\nIt\u2019s irritating, but overall it isn\u2019t something worth crying over, or having arguments with your boyfriend about.", "So for two years you still have your whole ass painting and didn't manage to hide or lose it, somebody found it, hilarity ensued, and woe is you.", "OK!
