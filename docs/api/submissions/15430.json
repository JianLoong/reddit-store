Don't wait just cause they want you to; there are a lot of options out there and you can make this dream happen. \n\nThey're required to take care of you since they brought you into this world and you had no say in it; I don't even understand parents that seem to think their kids owe them anything, they don't! And that's coming from a parent in case they, or anyone else, tries to tell you otherwise.\n\nYou did this and should be proud and they should be at least emotionally supportive even if they can't be financially so. NTA at all!", "NTA- based on the info provided, they were being horrible. why would she say \u201cyour dad didn\u2019t go, what makes you think you can?\u201d you already got accepted, that\u2019s why you can. and you don\u2019t have to pay for school upfront. it\u2019s called student loans that you don\u2019t have to start paying until 6 months after you graduate. i would be hurt too if they weren\u2019t excited for me and didn\u2019t want to celebrate with me", "NTA. I assume the last few years of you attending high school has been during the pandemic. You just got accepted into university and are excited about a new time in your life. Your parents should be happy for you. \n\nYour mom's words make it sound like they are jealous that you are attending college. They might have pushed you out of fear of you \"failing\" like they did. \n\nYou're NTA for wanting your parents to be happy for you and not push their insecurities onto you. (And congratulations on getting accepted, that's amazing!)", "NTA.  That\u2019s a great accomplishment and the should be proud of you.\n\nOn Monday, get your butt to the guidance counselor\u2019s office to start gathering information about how to pay for college if your parents won\u2019t help.  Hopefully they\u2019ll come around, but if they don\u2019t, it\u2019s better to know your options now so you\u2019re not scrambling at the last moment.", "NTA. They are assholes. Keep that financial bs quiet right now. They should congratulate you and stickler the rest for now. Of course there are concerns and stuff, but they were rude.", ">You know you're not going. You're gonna stay and work for a year or two then move out because your dad never went to college, what makes you think that you can?\"\n\nWhat even??? Bruh shouldn't you be happy that she can. \n\nOP NTA. Also, i know it may seem like a lot but please take a loan if the parents aren't willing to pay and go to college. Especially if you are saying it's well reputed and you know you want to take that course.", "Nta- it is a high tension time for both students and parents. Your mothers words though should have been different. I am sorry that they are not being supportive. Congrats on getting into college!", "NTA. That sucks. Don't let them bring you down, and go to your dream school no matter what it takes. Scholarships, grants, loans, everything. Prove your parents wrong and show them you CAN go to college. Congrats!", "definitely NTA. I understand that your parents may be worried about paying for your higher education, but there are other ways you can get the money for it (scholarships, financial aid, student loans). The fact that they\u2019re blatantly unsupportive of something you have worked so hard for is upsetting and demoralizing, especially if their excuse is the fact your dad didn\u2019t go to college, so they don\u2019t believe you can? either way, keep your head up and congrats, OP!", "NTA. Your parents should be supporting you here \n\nThough I suspect a money issue is likely driving the current reaction.  So make sure you plan to look out after yourself for paying for college and loans and scholarships and don\u2019t count on your parents until money is in your account. \n\nGood luck but something is going on.", "NTA, If your parents were so concerned about you applying for college and they were supportave. It seems strange that they would turn thir back on you now, I think you had every right to say what you said.", "NTA.\n\nThey can't just withdraw their support. You've worked hard to get into college, and it's cruel of them to discredit your achievement like that.", "NTA. It might have been an overreaction, something said out of tension and strong emotion, but it doesn't make you an asshole. Of course you were excited to be accepted, and taking a minute at work to just call with the happy news is perfectly normal. A more reasonable response from them would've been \"Wow! That's amazing news! Congratulations! We'll talk about it more when you get home.\"\nIt's also shitty of them to flip-flop like that - nagging you to apply for colleges, and then saying you can't go. If their financial situation has changed, or they can't afford to support you through college for whatever reason, that's one thing. But it's abusive to suddenly question your ability to even study, simply because your Dad didn't do so. You have every right to be upset with this sudden change of heart.", "NTA, they should have been more supportive.\n\nThat said, I feel like there's some detail missing if they desperately wanted you to go to college one day and then changed their minds overnight.\n\nYou said your dad didn't go to college - did your mom? Maybe they are under the false impression that the only way for you to go is that -they- have to pay but they can't? Are they familiar with financial aid and student loans? I'm just curious about such a huge 180.", "Congratulations on getting accepted to the college of your dreams!\n\nI'm sorry your family didn't show more support or enthusiasm. You are NTA. I didn't go to college until my 40's, so there's still time for your dad if he really wants to go. I even had classes with two of my children. Apply for scholarships and grants. I won a scholarship that paid for a year of my classes. \n\nI'm proud of you. Study hard!", "NTA, congratulations! Their reaction was very disappointing to you, you reacted as anyone would. Perhaps the reality of it and the fact they will likely now need to provide you assistance financially (don't know if this is the case as it wasn't very clear) has set in and they're not quite prepared? Idk, but hopefully they'll realize they should support you emotionally at the very least.", "First off, congratulations,that's a great achievement.  Your not an asshole, you were happy and wanted to share it with them. It's unfortunate that was their reaction. Sometimes people just don't think before they speak. I've no idea why that was their reaction, maybe they are scared. There's no excuse but the only way to find out is to ask them.", "You are NTA. You do not owe your parents anything for them raising you - that is their job as your parents. I'm sorry they're not being supportive. That's super crappy of them. Congratulations on getting in to that college!! You're going to do amazing things!", "Your parents are horrible assholes. Horrible horrible assholes. The fuck is going on with them.\n\nGet the fuck away from that family. Live the best life you can free of their negativity.\n\nYou are definitely an asshole for yelling at them, because be honest, respect your elders, but aside from that fuck them, get a move on with your life, and plan a future without them in it.", "You called them horrible, and if the shoe fits... one thing to not be over the moon reaction for you, but their response trying to dictate what you can do as an adult with your own dreams and desires is a whole other thing. If it's not going to cause any monetary strain on them, which as you said, you're not expecting them to pay, then they have 0 right to tell you what you should do. Parents should support kids when they are trying to better themselves. Bringing up dad not going makes it more seem like jealousy that the dad couldn't go, as that actually has no relevance.", "NTA - Congratulation  wish you to succeed", "INFO:  Are you expecting your parents to pay for your college?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your parents think you should be limited by their own choices. Find out from the college if there are options for financial aid and what you can do to secure financing. Your high school counselors should also be able to help you find scholarships or financial aid. Don\u2019t toss aside your dreams just because your parents are AHs.", "NTA! Apply for every scholarship you are eligible for and get you financial aid paperwork in. If your parents refuse to complete the paperwork, talk to the financial aid department at the school you will be attending. There is a way to get around that.\n\nCongratulations and Good Luck!\n\nEdit: Talk to your high school counselor if you have one. This is something they specialize in.", "NTA - it\u2019s really unsupportive and cruel of them to react this way. They should not punish you for having opportunities they didn\u2019t - they should be excited they are able to offer this life to their daughter and that their daughter is smart enough and worked hard enough to achieve this. It\u2019s extremely selfish to react in the way they did. \n\nWill you be able to go this year without their support? Did you get any financial aid or scholarship money?\n\nAnd congratulations on getting in!", "NTA. Go to your financial aid office. Look into what would be needed to classified as an independent. (I\u2019ve seen 2 students get approved. You essentially need documents saying your parents won\u2019t financially help you.)\n\nDon\u2019t let your parents get you down. I am not advising getting a bunch of student loans. There may be aid scholarships or housing for you. We had staff who even took in students and normally would get approved for housing sophomore year. \n\nCongratulations. I am so proud of you. I am glad you have friends that back you up. Be proud in your accomplishments! You did it. Not them. You.", "NTA\n\nSo sorry you\u2019re having to go through this, can\u2019t believe it still continues to happen even in modern day times. \nCongratulations on such an accomplishment! \nI Can relate as i had a similar experience with my parents. I (F) got into the best schools in the nation, and ended up having to compromise with a school that was \u201cx\u201d distance away from home because of manipulation, control, and \u201ctraditional values\u201d. On the day of college drop off, the ride there I was met with my parents threatening to turn the car around, and to \u201cjust go to a school by the house and live at home\u201d. Flash forward to being in school, I\u2019d call them to express me missing them, or to express how hard of a time id be having, and I\u2019d be met with \u201c well you wanted to go out there\u201d and the \u201csee what would happen if you left us\u201d type of bull crap. \n\nDon\u2019t make the mistake I did, run \ud83c\udfc3\u200d\u2640\ufe0f as fast as you can, when you can. \n\nId suggest talking to someone you\u2019re close to at school, who can provide support/guidance. \n\nLook at the resources the university you plan on going to provides. And depending on where you live, you can emancipate yourself so that you don\u2019t have to rely on your parents financial records, for proof for more financial aid through out the years. \n\nBest of luck, you got this! Don\u2019t let them guilt trip or gaslight you. They are most likely upset they couldn\u2019t achieve the same accomplishment you are, and are not happy with the fact that you are going to leave.", "You mother's reactions  to your good news is reprehensible.\n\nPlease get help and fill out the FAFSA application.  College is expensive.\n\nConsider taking classes at a cheaper school (community college) and then transferring for you final two yrs of so.\n\nNTA", "NTA - Your parents sound strange - at least their reaction was.   Cograts on getting in.   I hope you get financial aid and have a great experience.", "NTA. If the shoe fits...", "NTA. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on with your parents, but you need to get in touch with the school and see how you can arrange financing, even if you have to work two jobs. This sounds like a cruel joke, to encourage you to attain this chance, then try to take it away and control you. You\u2019re an adult, escape those monsters.", "NTA. Run.", "You are NTA honey!!! Congrats on getting into the school you wanted!! Your parents are TA here!!! They should be your biggest cheer leaders and be thrilled you got into the college of your dreams! Sorry that they didn't do this for you! \n\nI really hope that you find a way to follow your dreams!! Huge hugs flying your way!!", "OP you sound like me at your age, so I\u2019ll give you the advice I wish I could\u2019ve given me then: \n\n*If you are financially independent, get emancipated.* This matters for financial aid ENORMOUSLY. Even if your parents\u2019 income would still qualify, they don\u2019t sound like they plan to help- so you will be paying, and thus you need to be able to show the accurate household income involved. Do not let your parents claim you as a dependent, either. I had to hound my parents to do basic FAFSA stuff every year of undergrad, and their income was just enough to deny me most need-based aid, even though they never paid a dime of my loans or school costs. \n\nWhen I got into my state\u2019s best school - which also happened to be a top 5 best program for my major - my dad was like but I thought you\u2019d be going to community college???? Really, he was just sad his only friend was moving away and he couldn\u2019t complain about my mother to me as much. But also lol absolutely zero \u201ccongrats!\u201d \n\nFast forward ~15 years and I just got engaged to my partner of 10 years a few months ago (I have understandable hangups about marriage!) and instead of \u201ccongrats!\u201d I got \u201cabout time, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nSo, yeah. Every situation is different but i wouldn\u2019t count on them changing.", "First off, CONGRATULATIONS!!! \n\nNEXT: look at grants and scholarships. Your high school and your prospective college should both have a database of resources that aren't loans. Apply for ALL of them. Some might be only $50, but that another $50 you aren't paying off. Go to your local service organizations (assuming you're in the US, the immediate ones that come to mind are Kiwanis, Rotary, Elks, Scouts). Get very familiar with online used book stores (Abe Books, for example) for textbooks. \n\nFinally, of course you are NTA. Good job working hard and getting into school. I'm glad you have some people in your life cheering you on.", "NTA. I was the first person in my family to go to uni. The fact that no one else had been had, funnily enough, absolutely zero relevance to my decision making process. What a stupid thing for your mum to say. Congrats to you and go for it!", "Right, we're all well aware that college isn't cheap. But stuffing everything under the rug and immediately ruining my excitement not even 3 hours later just was rude and unsupportive.", "I'll be the first in my family to go to college. They know how financial aid works but it's not the first time they've told me I can't do something just because they can't. It's controlling and like insecure on their part.", "I've received comments asking about if they were gonna help and I apologize for leaving that part out but nope, they have no plans on assisting in any way. So even just some emotional support would've been nice or approaching the conversation differently instead of laying it on me that I'm not going just hours after I told them the news.", "That was the plan all along. I hate yelling and name calling but they really bring out the worst in me sometimes and going to college is the quickest way to separate myself from them and their negativity.", "Nope, since the age of 16 I've been paying my own car bills, groceries, doctor appointments, etc. I never ask my parents for anything besides gas money once in a while.", "Sounds like your parents feel threatened by the fact their child is succeeding where they failed. You have every right to be angry, this is a selfish and horrid reaction!", "I'm sorry to hear that. Congratulations on getting in - do your best to prove that you can do anything!", "They should be overjoyed for you. My parents were. If you think the financials are concerning, go to the community college for your basics and transfer to the accredited institution you got into. Call admissions and explain you can't afford it if you don't have the scholarships, then spend the next two years mapping out what you want and need to apply for to get there. You can do it.", "Most definitely! Well this further reinforces that you're NTA, sorry about that \ud83d\ude22", "Good for you. Truly. Life is going to be difficult but you'll make due and when you come out the other side, it'll all be worthwhile.\n\nCongratulations!", "NTA of course and I don't get their reaction.  I thought they did not want to pay for your college.  If that is not it, I don't get it.", "Cool, then they have no say. You\u2019re an adult. Pack your shit and go to college", "Your parents are a failure wow", "I couldn't tell you either honestly, I've been wondering if it's just them projecting their insecurities because I'll be the first in my family to go to college and maybe it will hurt my parents ego.", "NTA - To be clear, hurting their ego should not even be a thing. As a parent of college age kids, I can say that I always hope my kids do better than me. Only an AH narcissist would want their children to do worse or same as them so they don't look good. How does that even work? \"I raised a kid that failed\" does not make anyone look good. That said, maybe there's some other underlying issue going on? Afraid of you leaving or something like that?  \n\n\nSorry for their response. Congrats!", "My parents had close to the same reaction, they honestly though that college was a waste of money.  I moved out when I graduated from high school and got through on my own.  It was a bit uncomfortable for a few years, but eventually they were proud of me.", "I wouldn't think they're afraid. From the age of 13 they already considered me a \"16 year old\" and when I really was 16, they considerered me to be 18. They've applied so much pressure for me to grow up and get out of their house and leave as little responsibility for them.", "Ah right then, do exactly that. Got to college, get out of their house, and don\u2019t let them consider you as anything other than an adult that can decide life for yourself."]}
