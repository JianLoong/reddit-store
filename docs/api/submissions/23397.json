Repairs need to be completed first.\n\neta \u2014 it\u2019s not \u201cpunishment\u201d to not go on a vacation. That language is inflammatory. At worst it\u2019s disappointing to not go but there are hundreds of other ways to be kind & generous with kids & parents that won\u2019t put you in debt.", "NTA if you can no longer afford the vacation because of the repair costs. That\u2019s is a reasonable discussion to have with the family. Explain to the adults what is going on and let your brother explain it to his children.", "NTA\n\nTell everyone the truth - that the damage your BIL caused means that you can no longer afford to pay for the vacation. You aren\u2019t \u201cpunishing them\u201d, you aren\u2019t sueing him (he\u2019s possible sue proof even if you won) and bankrupting him - it is solely that you still have to pay out to cover the damage he caused and that means you can no longer afford it.", "How about just postponing the trip for a year or two?   Tell the family at dinner that due to the repair costs, it just isn\u2019t in the budget this year. You don\u2019t have to lay the blame anywhere though everyone will have their own opinion as to who is at fault.   You have to fix your office. That is the priority. You should not have to go into debt over a gift.  Good luck.", "INFO:   Has her brother even offered to pay for the damage?", "NTA\n\n But honestly, you would soon end up supporting your bil and his family. If i were you, i'd put things in clear with your wife. The way she keeps pushing her niblings onto you... you'll be expected to pay for their colleges too at this point", "Whose idea was it that he would do the work? Because it sounds a lot like it was the OP's wife who set the whole thing in motion, trying to steer the work her brother's way. Did she push him to bid on the job, and then push the OP to give him the job, despite the fact that the job was above his abilities?\n\nIn that case, the ultimate fault is the OP's wife, rather the BiL. Yes, she had generous motives, but they lead to disaster.", "NTA, you have a wife problem. You need to sit down together and look at your budget and ask her where else there is to cut except the trip. If you do end up going, I\u2019d be insisting that BIL stays home.", "NTA. You are being used as an ATM by your wife's family. The damage needs to be repaired and  your BIL isn't competent to do it. You have the money saved so you have to use it. Mold in a home is a serious problem.\n\nYou need to cancel the trip or postpone it until next year. Why does your wife tell you what you can or can't say? Just don't go to dinner. You have a wife problem.", "NTA.Go to dinner and give a statement, not open for discussion. You\u2019ve been saving for a year for this trip, it\u2019s not that you have extra money, if they still want to go, then wife\u2019s family should come up with the difference post repairs. If they can\u2019t or won\u2019t, then they\u2019d have to wait till you can afford it again. Repairs take precedence over vacations. Talk to your wife beforehand, tell her that she can\u2019t forbid you, she\u2019s your partner, not your boss, if she wants to discuss something to do it in a respectful manner not using threats or guilt trips.Tell her if her brother had insurance, you\u2019d still be going on the trip, her meddling ( even with good intentions) cost something to every party involved .( monetary and the trip).Don\u2019t let your wife pressure you into rehiring her brother for the repairs now that he\u2019s learned his lesson and can benefit from the experience.", "NTA.  Mistakes were made, and you had to cover the cost of repairs.  Delay the trip a little.   It's not punishing anyone. It just is.   \n\nThings happen, and sometimes those things cost time and money to rectify.   This means other things that cost time and money need to be put on hold for a little bit.   I doubt any of these mistakes were malicious, just honest mistakes or bad luck.  They weren't handled correctly either, so it got worse.", "NTA since it would affect your budget if you didn\u2019t cancel and apply funds toward the losses he caused. I know fixing that stuff is not cheap.\n\nThat said, you all should\u2019ve known better than to hire him. You already knew he wasn\u2019t qualified, so you were kind of asking for something to happen\u2026just saying\u2026", "NTA I\u2019d cancel trip permanently not even so much because he damaged stuff but the fact he left it for you to find instead of owning up and calling you ASAP or even trying to fix it before you got back\nHonestly I\u2019d even see about making him pay because he royally Fd up", "It's not punishing them. It's an unfortunate situation due to the cost of the repairs. Maybe do something smaller and plan something bigger down the line.", "NTA. Because you are not punishing them. The money you set aside for this trip is for a gift. And it would be great to give them that trip but you hired your BIL at your wife\u2019s insistance (never hire family, btw!) and not only did he damage your house, he left it and never informed you compounding that damage! You have a huge wife problem here with her demands and need to start putting your foot down for matters like this.\n\nIf you wish, you could take the inlaws and the kids but leave the BIL home.  And tell him no matter what he is not allowed.  And how is your SIL acting?  If she is sorry about this and a decent person, you can bring her. If not, leave her.  But this is all dependent on your monetary situation.  If it takes lots of saving to get to this point, then hell naw, this needs to be fixed immediately.  No matter what I\u2019d 100% put the BIL in his place in front of them.", "NTA. I see where shes coming from with the kids but if its explained out that you're not canceling because you're mad/punishing but becasue of the unexpected repair costs. Ultimately its her fault, she shouldnt have backed you into hiring her brother and now it sucks but she has to deal with those consequences", "NTA. This is on your wife. If she wants to take them on vacation, she can pony up the cost herself, since this is a mess entirely of her and her brothers making.", "Nta. It would be dumber to not cancel the trip than it was to hire the brother. You do not need to appease your wife and her obvious blind spot at the expense of your finances. Her brother did this, not you.", "Nta. \nDude,  its your wife who's stupid.  \nShe can say whatevee unfairness in the world when she didnt foot all the bill. \nMake her pay and we'll see", "Nta cancel and he better be glad you dont take him to court", "I came here prepared to judge differently from the title. But you are clearly NTA. It\u2019s not punishing, it\u2019s having to use the funds for an emergency the the future trip beneficiary happened to have caused.", "NTA. You would be well within your rights to sue BIL for damages. I really hope you and your wife have seperate finances because I doubt she's making good decisions when it comes to her family.", "NTA. If you can\u2019t afford the trip now because of what he did then that\u2019s what it is. Cancel it. Your wife is ridiculously stupid in this case. What are you supposed to do? Go into debt so his kids can have a vacation? \n\nWhen you marry someone you marry their family. If their family is a hot mess, run, because their poor decisions will definitely affect you and any kids you have. Trust me, this isn\u2019t ending here. Your wife will keep pushing and pushing you for financial help for them.", "NTA but I kind of agree with your wife not to punish the kids for the actions of the useless father \n\nI do really think your wife should talk to her brother and tell him he can\u2019t just destroy your property with no thought and that you won\u2019t be hiring him again and that he owes you both a massive apology though. If it weren\u2019t for your nieces/nephews that\u2019s the kind of behaviour I\u2019d go no contact over tbh. Unfortunately you\u2019re probably going to have to take the slightly more diplomatic route (but he does owe you a grovelling apology and should know and understand why you\u2019re furious)", "NTA\n\nIt's not punishment, it's natural consequences.", "NTA. \nBut take the nieces and nephews and parents  and leave brother at home. He did the damage, not his kids or parents.", "NTA, but I understand where your wife is coming from as well.\n\nI would probably swallow the cost for the kids who dont deserve to suffer for their fathers stupidity, but make it clear to the BiL that he screwed up and owes you some form or restitution going forward.", "ESH. Yes, an exceedingly unpopular opinion, I know. But I really, really think this isn't fair to your nieces and nephews. If you hadn't told them yet, I'd have said, sure, but this just isn't right.\n\nThat said, both your wife and your BIL need to own up. Your wife for overestimating her brother's abilities and being too gullible, and your BIL for overestimating his own abilities and turning it into a way bigger mess than it needed to be, even when you consider his limitations. He should have called you the second he hit the water pipe, even more so when he realized he didn't know how to shut off the water.\n\nYou need to have a chat with both of them on how they intend to make up for this. That's what's missing from your story. Both your wife and brother seem to want to let bygones by bygones, and that's unacceptable.", "> wife said it\u2019s not fair to punish her nieces, nephews, and parents since they\u2019ve been excited about the trip\n\nAlmost corrected. It's not fair for the nieces and nephews, the bil totally deserved it.\n\nRegardless of what you choose, the bil need to pay you with his own money: refund + damages.  Don't pay for it with with your money you planned to spend in a gift. ESH (you a little bit, and bil a lot)", "YWBA\n\nIf you already told the kids and parents, it's a real dick move to pull it back.\n\nI fully understand your desire to separate from your BIL but yeah the shotgun approach is a bad idea. You'll end up looking worse than he does.", "YWBTA.  Eat the cost and NEVER hire a friend or relative to do any kind of skilled work, even if they have the credentials.  Always stay in your home when someone is doing work.  I guess this is a really expensive lesson, but now you know.  Since this is your wife's brother, she needs to come up with a plan to pay for her brother's mess.  Not your problem, but hers. I know she wants to take everyone on vacation, but she needs to figure out how the repairs are going to be done in a timely manner.  Come to a consensus as to the timeframe and let her do the work.", "So many of these post aren\u2019t am I the AH but is it justified for me being a asshole.", "YWBTA\n\nTake it up with BIL. Have it out with him.\n\nDon't punish everyone else for this and next time stick to your guns.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
