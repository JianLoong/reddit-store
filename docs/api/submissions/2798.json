Grace really only comes to stay on the weekends since she\u2019s in college, and this time she brought her boyfriend Issac (21m) with her.\n\nI\u2019m biracial, my dad is white and my mom is black. Honestly I don\u2019t look anything like my dad so most people don\u2019t even think I am mixed. We like to joke that I got his personality instead of his looks.\n\nPeople tend to say offhanded stuff to me about how I don\u2019t look the way they think I\u2019m \u201csupposed to\u201d. I\u2019m kind of used to it especially since my dad ended up married to a woman that is also white so like every time I\u2019m with them it obviously looks like I\u2019m the odd one out. I\u2019m not afraid to correct people, but sometimes that gets exhausting and I\u2019ll just play dumb instead.\n\nGrace and I had planned to get lunch together and her bf Issac ended up coming along with us. She wants him and I to get to know each other better since she really likes him, so I figured that\u2019s why she brought him.\nWhile we were having lunch, my mom\u2019s side of the family was brought up, and then Issac said that it must\u2019ve been a shock to my dad at least for me to end up so dark since most mixed kids are lighter in complexion than I am. But then he said that at least I ended up with \u201cgood hair\u201d so I didn\u2019t lose out completely.\n\nGrace didn\u2019t speak up and say anything to him about it, so I pretended not to understand what he meant and asked what was so good about my hair and what it was he thought I was losing out on anyway.\nHe got flustered and said \u201cwell you know\u2026most girls with your skintone have curlier hair.\u201d\nSo then I asked why he thought my hair was good just because it wasn\u2019t that curly. He said he felt it just looked nicer. So I asked why he thought that textured hair didn\u2019t look just as nice. He kept blubbering out excuses and digging the hole even deeper for himself, and finally Grace told me to cut it out and leave him alone.\n\nI paid for my part of lunch and left after that. I didn\u2019t tell my dad or Hannah what happened, but it\u2019s obvious enough that Grace is mad at me. My dad asked that she and I solve whatever the problem is, because he hates seeing us be so tense around each other.\n\nGrace ended up telling me that she was pissed because I made her boyfriend look like a jerk by playing dumb. I told her that I didn\u2019t have to make him look like a jerk because he already was one, but she said that I drew the problem out more than necessary and made it worse than it needed to be when I could\u2019ve just told him that he f\u2019ed up.\n\nI mean I could have done that, but I don\u2019t think it should be my job to, and plus I feel like it was probably more effective to get him to explain his logic outloud rather than have me tell him he was being a jerk.\n\nGrace is insisting that I should have just told him point blank, and bc I didn\u2019t, she thinks I\u2019m an AH.\n\nEdit:\n\nMy dad just texted me to ask if something happened at lunch with Grace\u2019s bf so I\u2019m pretty sure when him and my stepmom get home later, I\u2019m going to tell him what happened since it seems like he already knows something did.\n\nAlso, I do wanna say that my reluctance about telling my dad and Hannah isn\u2019t because I want to protect Issac or anything, it\u2019s because Grace is my step sister and I care about her. I know she really likes this guy and I really only feel bad bc even though I know I didn\u2019t really ruin anything for her, it feels like I did. The situation just sucks I guess.\n\nEdit 2:\n\nI ended up telling my dad and Hannah what happened when they got home, and they both told me that I did absolutely nothing wrong. Hannah said that she would talk to Grace about it, and my dad basically said that Issac was no longer welcome anywhere near our house.\n\nDad also gave me a mini motivational speech where he reiterated that I look perfect just the way I am and that colorist/texturist/racist bigots have no place in our family or our home.\n\nGrace drove back to campus a while ago so I guess Hannah is gonna call her later to talk with her about what happened.", "created_utc": 1668958449, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z071hy/aita_for_pretending_not_to_understand_a_joke_so/", "score": 11683, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You paid to have that said to you.\n\nIf she didn't want it to go further, *she* should have said he messed up and addressed it directly, or at least apologized to everybody and said she'd talk to him about it later. I get that she's 20 and immature and maybe didn't know how to handle such an uncomfortable situation, but she doesn't get to offload that responsibility onto her even younger step sister. If she just didn't handle it right, like she froze up and didn't know what to say, and afterwards apologized, that would be one thing. She could work on that and educate herself on how to respond effectively in those situations. Instead she is blaming you for making her boyfriend feel bad for saying a bad thing. You were left on your own in that situation and you handled it the safest and most effective way you could. That's impressive. She should be thanking you, if anything.\n\nI worry she doesn't actually understand what was so wrong with what he said. Or she even agrees with him somewhat. Why else would she not have immediately reacted to him (\"Isaac, why the fuck would you say that?\"), not think he should feel appropriately bad for saying it, be mad at you at all, and why else would she think it's wrong for him to feel humiliation while you're supposed to defend yourself from humiliation, without causing him any? She either doesn't see the problem with what she said, or she thinks racist comments should all be handled by the black people who receive the comments, and they should always be handled in a way that doesn't make the white person feel bad for saying it. She doesn't think white people should hold any responsibility for the racist things they say, and that their partners say?\n\nSorry this got me riled up and I kept going!

I'm not in any way shape or form defending the boyfriend's words and before I get downvoted to hell by people who want to argue racial issues with me, it is no one's responsibility to educate each other on feelings and certainly not on race.

She purposely acted in a manner in which to make someone else uncomfortable and knew what she was doing and seemed to be entertained by it. If she had explained WHY what he said was offensive, my guess is that the outcome would have been a different one. I can understand why both grace and op are upset. It sounds like grace is upset that op purposely made someone uncomfortable that she cared about and op is upset because she's insecure about ignorant people passing judgement on her, and then in turn is judging others.

I can\u2019t tell you how many people felt entitled to touch my stomach when I was pregnant\u2014like I was just a suitcase for the baby inside me with no bodily autonomy. SMH.", "She\u2019s flirting with you.", "> \\*flat stare\\*\n\nComes from all those flat packs used in assembly :)", "Exactly. She shouldn\u2019t have even had to play dumb- grace should have said something before anyone did.", "Solid mic drop", "Honestly it was kinder to ask him why he thought that- instead of just calling him an AH she asked him why he felt that way and gave him a chance to realize how mean what he said was and apologize. \n\nBut he doubled down instead. \n\nNTA", "\"Racism lite.......  Now with less oppression!\"\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "I've heard about people doing this and for the life of me, I can't understand why anyone would get combative over wanting to touch another person's hair.  Compliment it -- sure!  Your hair is beautiful!  May I touch it -- NO!  STOP! PUT YOUR HANDS IN YOUR POCKETS AND WALK AWAY.  Ding-aling!", "I worked in an office where a biracial woman (AfroLatina) came on a Monday with her hair braided. Her hair was short and then braided down to her ass. A white co-worker that always said inappropriate things to everyone, exclaimed how long it got over the weekend and grabbed it. Held it in her hand and kept asking if it was real. The co-worker with the braids looked like she wanted to die and take her with her. It was horrible. The supervisor (black woman) had to talk to the white woman and explain why it was inappropriate. It was awkward for everyone, but the idiot that did it.", "Anyone's hair is a 'No Touch Zone!' Being a naturally wavy/curly red head in Japan is almost as bad. Getting treated like a petting zoo animal gets old very fast.", "WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE and WHAT BARN WERE THEY RAISED IN?? As a white person, it\u2019s so embarrassing.", "Maybe have her give the lady a link to the Ted Talk by Mena Fombo, or to her book. I grew up in a small,  very caucasian town and only realized I had to actively educate myself about micro aggressions and being antiracist once I was in grad school for social work.  I hope providing a resource is something that might start to open the coworker's eyes without your friend having to be the educator. I have other resources I found helpful if you want as well!", "I have never understood that weird urge/fetish to touch POC hair if you're white. I'm a generic mayosapian and when I was a child I idolized Grace Jones, her complexion, muscles, and her short 80s cut (probably because I secretly hated having my hair brushed). I threw a complete meltdown tantrum when my mom tried to explain that I could never grow up to look like her. That's probably as close as I can get to understanding that draw to hair.", "It's wrong no matter who she is. My manager keeps tweeting to touch my hair but the races are reversed. No always means no, for everyone", "What the fuck ? The coworker needs to back off. She is coming off as creepy. \ud83d\ude05", "Continuing to ask after your friend has told her no, is harassment. Race-based at that. She needs to go to HR.", "I suspect it's the novelty (curiosity over a sensory experience they've never had), and that people with straight hair living in areas where textured hair is the norm get the same sort of reaction.\n\nI haven't ever felt what textured human hair is like and can admit to a deep curiosity to know if it feels the way I think it would (soft and springy), but since I know that's off limits, I restrict myself to compliments instead.  And I spend lots of time sproinging my pet sheep to make up for it ;-)", "It's not anyone's job to explain why they don't want you to touch their body. No matter the race.", "I love, love, love the four words \"sproinging my pet sheep.\"\n\nOkay, yeah, I am curious about what hair feels like in one instance: braids. White hair and Black hair. I want to see how heavy they are, especially if they're decorated, because that looks like I'd have a migraine after a day. I'm not sure if that counts as curiosity about Black hair, but in any case, if I \\*ever\\* asked someone who wasn't a friend if I could heft their braided hair, I would immediately set myself on fire from pure shame.", ">\tand my dad basically said that Issac was no longer welcome anywhere near our house.\n\n>\tDad also gave me a mini motivational speech where he reiterated that I look perfect just the way I am and that colorist/texturist/racist bigots have no place in our family or our home.\n\nNTA - I think this is kinda extreme in my opinion. As someone black who\u2019s literal mom has said that I have \u201cbad hair\u201d, compared against my brother\u2019s \u201cgood hair\u201d, no one would exile or prohibit a black person for saying this. In my opinion, I\u2019d try to find the grace to forgive him if he offers a well thought out apology. That\u2019s just my perspective, informed by my personal experience. You and your family are welcome to cut him out but I don\u2019t think people that have said racist, colorist, etc things are irredeemable.", "I have wavy hair and when I was younger I always wanted it to be perfectly straight because I didn\u2019t like how the \u201cbumps\u201d felt when I\u2019d put my hair in a ponytail. So I\u2019d constantly be redoing it. Whereas people with straight hair would tell me they wish they had hair like mine because apparently straight hair is harder to style when it\u2019s down.", "When I was about 7 or 8, my mom took me to Mexico. I was tiny, and white with longish white-blonde hair, and the locals could not stop petting me. It made me very sensitive to being touched later, heck still. My mom did not even try to stop them, and no from a little kid does not seem to matter.", "My daughter has red, spiral curls. Dry her hair hangs to her shoulder blades, wet it\u2019s waist length. It\u2019s beautiful. Her whole life people have been drawn to her hair. In high school kids would sit behind her do they could play with her hair (I learned this after the fact or would have taken action). On top of that, add all the weird ideas people have about red heads. People can be so odd."]}
