Grace really only comes to stay on the weekends since she\u2019s in college, and this time she brought her boyfriend Issac (21m) with her.\n\nI\u2019m biracial, my dad is white and my mom is black. Honestly I don\u2019t look anything like my dad so most people don\u2019t even think I am mixed. We like to joke that I got his personality instead of his looks.\n\nPeople tend to say offhanded stuff to me about how I don\u2019t look the way they think I\u2019m \u201csupposed to\u201d. I\u2019m kind of used to it especially since my dad ended up married to a woman that is also white so like every time I\u2019m with them it obviously looks like I\u2019m the odd one out. I\u2019m not afraid to correct people, but sometimes that gets exhausting and I\u2019ll just play dumb instead.\n\nGrace and I had planned to get lunch together and her bf Issac ended up coming along with us. She wants him and I to get to know each other better since she really likes him, so I figured that\u2019s why she brought him.\nWhile we were having lunch, my mom\u2019s side of the family was brought up, and then Issac said that it must\u2019ve been a shock to my dad at least for me to end up so dark since most mixed kids are lighter in complexion than I am. But then he said that at least I ended up with \u201cgood hair\u201d so I didn\u2019t lose out completely.\n\nGrace didn\u2019t speak up and say anything to him about it, so I pretended not to understand what he meant and asked what was so good about my hair and what it was he thought I was losing out on anyway.\nHe got flustered and said \u201cwell you know\u2026most girls with your skintone have curlier hair.\u201d\nSo then I asked why he thought my hair was good just because it wasn\u2019t that curly. He said he felt it just looked nicer. So I asked why he thought that textured hair didn\u2019t look just as nice. He kept blubbering out excuses and digging the hole even deeper for himself, and finally Grace told me to cut it out and leave him alone.\n\nI paid for my part of lunch and left after that. I didn\u2019t tell my dad or Hannah what happened, but it\u2019s obvious enough that Grace is mad at me. My dad asked that she and I solve whatever the problem is, because he hates seeing us be so tense around each other.\n\nGrace ended up telling me that she was pissed because I made her boyfriend look like a jerk by playing dumb. I told her that I didn\u2019t have to make him look like a jerk because he already was one, but she said that I drew the problem out more than necessary and made it worse than it needed to be when I could\u2019ve just told him that he f\u2019ed up.\n\nI mean I could have done that, but I don\u2019t think it should be my job to, and plus I feel like it was probably more effective to get him to explain his logic outloud rather than have me tell him he was being a jerk.\n\nGrace is insisting that I should have just told him point blank, and bc I didn\u2019t, she thinks I\u2019m an AH.\n\nEdit:\n\nMy dad just texted me to ask if something happened at lunch with Grace\u2019s bf so I\u2019m pretty sure when him and my stepmom get home later, I\u2019m going to tell him what happened since it seems like he already knows something did.\n\nAlso, I do wanna say that my reluctance about telling my dad and Hannah isn\u2019t because I want to protect Issac or anything, it\u2019s because Grace is my step sister and I care about her. I know she really likes this guy and I really only feel bad bc even though I know I didn\u2019t really ruin anything for her, it feels like I did.

One time my mum made a joke asking my cousin if he had a girlfriend yet, so I then made a joke if he had a boyfriend yet. She then got really offended and I played dumb, asking why couldnt he have a boyfriend. She did the exact same thing as Grace's boyfriend did, stammered over herself and dug herself a hole trying to defend herself when I only did the same thing she did (said cousin ended up coming out as bi and saying me doing that to her made him feel safer with me so win win for us lol).", "I think you mean well but the problem is the \u201cjoke\u201d was incredibly racist whether he meant it that way or not and every time someone is given the excuse that they did not know it is racist it will just continue and nothing will change.

I have a friend who is black like me, and told me how a white female at her job keeps asking to touch her hair. No matter how many times she says no the girl continues to ask.

BUT she's demonstrated that is ok for her to have others say racist things. She won't speak out and she'll be upset with you if you do correct them. She's minimizing what's happened and in fact standing with the racist. I hope this dies down and she realizes how wrong her thinking and actions were. But if not, you have a sis who seems to think racism isn't a big deal, which kind of makes her racist also.", "That doesnt make it right.", "Yes, totally. NTA. You gave him a way out to apologize or explain himself. It's not your fault he didn't take the opportunity to acknowledge what he said was racist.", "The way you handled it was definitely the best way for him to understand and reflect.

Grace knew what he was saying wrong, and rather than step in a gently correct him, because maybe his (inexcusable, to be clear) comments come from ignorance rather than maliciousness, she left you to handle it, and you did. In your way.\n\nPoint out to Grace that if he does feel embarrassed or bad now, it isn't because of what you did but because he actually had to hear his own bullshit out loud. It's hard to run from how wrong you are when someone makes you say it clearly and out loud. This is not a you problem, it is a him problem. \n\nIf Grace wants someone to educate her boyfriend, she should do it. If she doesn't like what he said and feels it makes him a jerk, she should reevaluate who she is dating, rather than being mad at you. It's her relationship, her boyfriend and her problem.

I actually had to get it thinned out, like a lot. Now I have it shaved into a Mohawk because of how heavy it gets and I got sick of thinning it out every few months.
