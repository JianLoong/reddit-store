We have matching friendship tattoos and were ride or die (so i believed). MOH and I were both asked to be bridesmaids and started helping with the wedding. \nIn May 2022 something horrific happened and MOH and I are no longer speaking. \n\nTo explain, MOH's husband 41M did something unforgivable to my son 14M and while I do not blame MOH for what happened, her quick denial, victim blaming and accusations of my son are the reason I have decided to go completely no contact with her.(She has since told bride that she regrets her actions and has started to believe my son but is still with her husband.)\n\nNeedless to say this has made it difficult for the bride as she is friends with both of us. When everything happened I told her that I would step down as her bridesmaid. She told me she still wanted me to be in the wedding and by her side but she didn't know what to do. I told her I would do whatever would make her happiest to make the day about her and her soon to be husband, but to take her time and tell me what she wants. \n\nI have done my best not to put Bride in the middle with everything that happened, but I know it has been hard for her and I still feel there is a new distance between us because of the falling out with MOH. \nI have been asked for some small help with the wedding since and have done what I can as I live 5 hours away at this time. But I have to assume at this point that she has decided to not have me at the wedding, as it is 2 weeks away and I haven't been told the address or what I should be wearing. I am okay with not being there if it will be better for her. (I have known the bride longer but due to me moving out of state when my son was younger she and MOH became closer.) I just wish she would actually say that is what she wants instead of leaving me dangling in the wind, which is how I feel. \n\nWhen asked if she knows how she wants to celebrate with my family the response is I don't know.  I am trying not to lose both my best friends and my son's Aunties from the actions of one asshole, but I am having trouble with the lack of honesty right now. \n\nFor some context, MOH and her husband have had a bad past 10 years and she has started to leave many times but always ends up staying.  I know this is part of the delay for Bride as she was hoping MOH would come to her senses and leave her abusive husband. While I don't believe she and I will ever be friends again due to this whole thing I hope she does, as she deserves to be happy and I know from her, she hasn't been for some years now. \n\nBecause all of this is mess, I have done my best not to push or put my remaining friends in the middle but I really feel like they could be respectful of me as well by telling me the truth of what they want. I feel like I'm back in high school.", "created_utc": 1674462994, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10j7rej/aita_for_wanting_my_friend_to_tell_me_im_no/", "score": 156, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Since you don't have any details about the wedding and it's two weeks away, she's already made her choice.  She just doesn't have the guts to tell you.\n\nHonestly, I would reconsider this friendship and not go to the wedding.  The fact that she's still friends with a woman that called your son a liar (even if she later regretted it), and is pushing you out of her wedding without explaining herself says a lot about her character.  \n\nINFO: Did MOH apologize to you and your son?", "I see the question as if you are the AH for wanting clarification about the wedding directly from the bride given the circumstances. \n\nNTA \n\nThe friendship with you is already unsalvageable.  That\u2019s why she said she\u2019s trying to not lose both of her best friends. \n\nI\u2019m so sorry to you and to your son.  What happened wasn\u2019t fair.  The bride should have put the boundaries on MOH.  This wasn\u2019t fair to either you or your son.", "NTA. Frankly, the bride *did* choose, and she chose the woman who *stayed with a man who hurt a child*. \n\n*Neither* of these people are your friend, and I'm *disgusted* with the AH bride that she's ghosting you to make her own life easier in favour of her massive AH MOH.\n\nYou deserve better.", "Info: Should the husband be in jail for what he did or is he facing charges? If it is an on-going case, it may not be wise for you to be around him anyway\u2026", "NTA, but it sounds like she made her choice. And despite you not wanting your son to lose his \u201caunties,\u201d I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really healthy for them to remain a part of his life. I know \u201chorrific\u201d means different things to different people, but to me it means that something unforgivable (and possibly illegal) happened. Your son is more important than these friendships.", "NTA. It is completly compremensible why you cut contact with your ex best friend. And it is definitly not out of line to wonder if you are still invited.\n\nWould it be difficult to ask the bride directly? Like 'hey, your wedding is in two weeks. Could you tell me, if I'm still welcome there? Should I wear a bride maid dress? I'm sorry to push you, but I would have to book a room. If not, it is okay. It is your day. I don't want to make it difficult for you. and I'm happy for you anyway'", "NTA Two weeks away and she didn't bother to give you the address means that you are not in the wedding party and not invited to the wedding. It's likely despite who may be in the wrong or right with your son's matter that the bride believes you mat not be able to handle seeing the MOH and her husband and may start drama at her wedding. At this point, she has chosen her other friend over you perhaps because you now live far away and she is relying more on the MOH. \n\nDo not contact the bride further. When she reaches out if it is before the wedding, let her know that her notice is too short for you to make preparations to attend. If she reaches out after the wedding enquiring why you didn't attend, remind her that she didn't provide you with the address. Either way, do not stay home and sulk. Plan something fun for you and your son for the wedding day. Don't tell him in advance about the new plans, so if ever the friendship is resolved, she doesn't find out that you planned ahead to be absent, notwithstanding the circumstances. \n\nSometimes friendships come to an end. It's a new beginning for her and importantly, a new beginning for you. Put your son's well-being first and good luck.", "NTA. If the wedding is 2 weeks away and you haven't been given an address or told what to wear, that's pretty rude. Rather than wait for clarity from her, you might just want to let the bride know that you're assuming you're no longer in the wedding party, but would like to know where the wedding is to be held if she wants you there as a guest.", "Definitely NTA, I would just contact the bride and say \"I am assuming that with the lack of communication that I am no longer a bridesmaid, which is fine as I was not at all comfortable being around MOH. Could you please just confirm this for me.\" Or something along those lines.", "NTA at all, i hope your son is doing better.\n\nMOH is obviously in denial and need to open her eyes, but victims of abuse are usually the last ones to realise what is going on.\n\nAs for your friend that's getting married, you're merely expecting her to be honnest, it's not much to expect at all from suchan old friend.", "NTA. \n\nIf it's two weeks away, and you've been given no pertinent info, I'd assume you aren't in it. Let the bride know you know, and be grateful.\n\nSomeone else made a good point - if this is a legal case, it's probably better that you aren't around MOH and her husband. \n\nI'm sorry this is happening.", "NTA. You don't what to put the bride in the middle but the bride is also not making it easy for you. Always choose your own family and well-being.", "NTA. Honestly this type of behavior from her is grounds to cut her out, as well. I\u2019m sorry that this happened, but you need to do a hard refresh of your social circle.", "Nta.  That's clear for the specific question. \n\nBride made her choice.   \n\nThe fact that both of your son's \"aunties\" have essentially chosen to take the side of the abuser and not protect your CHILD has me concerned why you think they would be safe people to have in his life.   Bride not making a stand against the abuse is her choosing a side.   \n\nI know there's history,  but if it were my child?   They'd both be thrown out.", "Look this is going to be kind of mean, people can downvote me as they please but yes YTA. Why are you waiting around for an answer? You say you don't want to put the bride in the middle yet you are waiting for her to literally choose between you and the MOH. Your comfort and her's (the bride's)\n\nAnd also the MOH's husband hurt you child, and she attacked him yet you defended her in your own post? She may be a victim of his abuse but she IS STILL WITH HIM AND ATTACKED YOU CHILD. This never should have been what the bride was comfortable with, I don't care if MOH has said to the bride she regrets it and feels bad she isn't apologizing to YOU or YOUR SON. The reality is the bride should have cut her out and stood by your side since MOH wanted to defend a monster. But she didn't, instead she tried not to choose. That isn't a friend.\n\nSo OP you choose, you cut them both off until MOH actually apologizes to YOU. Your baby was hurt and then attacked no one else's feelings matter. \n\nIt's none of our business but are charges being filed?, a case being made against him? how is this man free?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
