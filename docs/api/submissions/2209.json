Her daughter Kiki (25 f) is my god-daughter and since she was a child I have taken her on a ski weekend once a year, just the two of us. (No one else skis in her family but Kiki. I taught her @ age 5.) Gwen has 6 children altogether and I try to do special things with all of them individually but I can't afford to take them all on vacation. Also my friend's other children are all under 12 years old, so taking a bunch of kids out of town isn't something my anxiety can handle. I never had children because I have severe anxiety plus I enjoy doing what I want, when I want and having the money to maintain my lifestyle. The issue is that Gwen has decided that on our next ski trip in January, that she wants to come along. She knows she can't afford to go but is trying to guilt myself and Kiki to pay for her. I have the money but since her separation, she has become a total drama queen who can't even let anyone else talk because she needs to emotionally dump on everyone ALL THE TIME. She also talks about inappropriate things about the divorce details in front of her kids, especially Kiki bc she is older and it makes her extremely uncomfortable. For 3 day out of the year, I like to spoil my god-daughter and let her pretend she is an only child.  I just really enjoy our vacations and since Kiki is getting married in 2024, I know our solo vacations will probably come to an end. WIBTA if I told Gwen she couldn't come? And how can I tell her without messing up a 40-year friendship? \n\nI'm also afraid that in Gwen's fragile state she will be distraught and try to ruin my relationship with Kiki. \ud83d\ude2a", "created_utc": 1668317187, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytss1z/wibta_for_telling_my_friend_she_cant_go_on_a_trip/", "score": 69, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It is normally an AH move to \"invite yourself\" to an event.  Perhaps you could tell Gwen she can come by offering the following boundaries:  (1)  She must pay her own way and (2) The trip will be a \"no divorce talk zone\".", "You would NBTA. First of all, Gwen invited herself, which is a huge no-no when it comes to etiquette. Secondly, if there\u2019s a time that Kiki needs a trip with just you, it is right now. You could just go sit in the car for three days and Kiki would probably just be happy to get away from her drama queen of a mom. Finally, this might be the final one; you don\u2019t want to mar the past with Kiki by having your last trip together really just be a weekend that\u2019s all about Gwen, because let\u2019s face it, Gwen is just finding as many ways as she can to be the center of attention. And just because you have the money doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s money we\u2019ll spent on Gwen like that. Best of luck.", "NTA \n\nJust tell her you want to spend quality time alone with your god-child", "Nta. \nI don\u2019t know what your means are but maybe you could stay firm on the No-ski vacation, but suggest a week-end at a nearby spa/hotel? She could contribute what she could and you pay the rest (and Kiki could also come if she wants)? \nYou don\u2019t have to do that at all of course, just a suggestion.", "NTA. it's a bit of a universally dick move to invite yourself to a restaurant or a night out why would inviting yourself on a holiday be any different?. Plus it may be useful to set boundaries now or it may become problematic later on. When Kiki is married what's to stop her mom from interjecting herself into that relationship if the boundaries aren't made very clear now? Best of luck OP", "NTA. This is a tradition that doesn't include mom. She has a bunch of kids half Kiki's age. Like 2 different generations almost. Just say no. Maybe next time... hahaha", "First you need to have an honest discussion with Kiki and see what she wants. NTA for not wanting her to come though but I think you need Kiki's input here. Be open with her. If she also agrees not wanting her there, be honest with your friend.  It might hurt but it might be true. Offer instead to go somewhere just the two of you for a weekend and this way she can vent outside Kiki's presence.", "NTA. Who invites themselves with no money? I'd flip the tables and be a little upset she put you in a position to NOT be able to say no w/o her getting mad. And her wanting you to help pay since she can't afford it.. This isn't\"good friend\" behavior. The nerve", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust tell her she needs to send the money before you make the booking if she wants to come.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
