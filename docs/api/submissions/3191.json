I owed the hospital roughly $30 grand but I was able to apply for financial assistance thru the business office (I had no property or other means of paying it back at that time) and it was wiped out. The surgeon (his bill was separate) knocked over 1/2 off and told me as long as I paid monthly (even $5), it would not go into collections (I was able to pay him when I returned to work). So if you have any extra cost, check if you have the option to set up a monthly payment plan and as long as you pay monthly, it will not go into collections.
