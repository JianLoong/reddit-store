I won't go into specifics to stay anonymous, but this is the 2nd time I've been diagnosed with a Bone Cancer. Before I was treated outpatient and this time I'm inpatient in the hospital for a full week with 24-hour chemo. It's debilitating to say the least. My family doesn't come from wealth and we barely have been above the surface even before I was diagnosed. The first treatment, we set up a gofundme and fundraisers to help pay for my treatments and surgery.\n\nMy mother said at the beginning of all this that I would never have to worry about finances. I was grateful, but knew deep down I would worry anyway. And sure enough, I did. But not about the Financials, but about her.\n\n Following my surgery, my mother finally (about 6 months into diagnosis) formed a gofundme, asking for an outrageous amount (I think $100,000) My surgery was well over $250,000, but was thankfully covered by insurance. However, we did have bills still that we had paid through other fundraising.\n\nI asked my mom how much we owed from surgery(prior to calling billing and asking for the itemized statement). My mother said that we still owed over $50,000 and she had to take money from her retirement to cover it. I actually felt guilty for getting cancer and surviving such a lengthy surgery. My mother said the gofundme would be used for my medical bills but also to pay her back for the retirement money. I later found out that insurance did cover everything and that we didn't owe/pay anything from my 15-hr limb salvage surgery. I was furious.\n\nAfter finishing chemo in April, I went back to work to pay off my medical bills and hopefully return to normal life. My mother didn't help with the financial part at all, most of my bills were close to collections and I ended up having to go into credit card debt to save my credit score from medical collections.\n\nUnfortunately, only after 6 months of remission, the cancer came back. I would be going back to chemo and amputating my leg that the cancer was in.\n\nI've been honest, telling my mother I wanted her to have no part in the financial aspect.\n\nShe's threatened to sue and remove me from her insurance. I've even tried compromising with her saying we could both be on the charitable account, gofundme, and any other sites used, of course with my direct supervison and joint ownership. But she's still upset and won't budge.\n\nI'm tempted to take my recovery time between chemo to create an account at a financial institution myself, start a gofundme without her, and start a venmo as well. I know that will make her very upset though and I don't have the capabilities to handle her that way.

First off I\u2019m so sorry about your diagnosis and that on top of it all you have to deal with worrying about raising money, I\u2019m pretty sure your mom committed fraud :/.

I'm not sure if I read this right, but she started a GoFundMe, when most of the part she was talking about was already covered? Then you had to sort out financially the rest of the bits. Now she is threatening to sue her own daughter with a cancer diagnosis and take them off medical insurance (wwhhaaaat) if she can't be involved again. I'm so sorry that is insane.... I'm sorry what you're going through and wishing you the best for your treatment. It's obviously been tough news for your mother too but literally blackmailing you with something that's life / death is just cruel. Sorry, but your mum's is the AH here. Hopefully she will calm down and see sense soon when she can think more logically. \n\nI'm so sorry that you have a healthcare system where you have finances to worry about on top of all the stresses of having a life changing condition. Hopefully you get a GoFundMe sorted soon in whatever format to help ease that burden. All the best xx", "I wish you all the best in your recovery from both your diagnosis and your mom\u2019s toxicity.

It may not be legal for your mom to remove you as a dependant with such pending medical proceedures. \n\nDon't make waves with your mom until after the surgery. \n\nThen get in touch with a lawyer and demand every cent your mom has raised in your name and if she wants to deduct out of pocket expenses fir medical bills, she needs to give you an itemized bill of the same. \n\nIf that doesn't pan out, then talk to Gofundme and report your mom for the fraud. \n\nWhile I would normally tell you that it's perfectly logical and above the board  to use any excess charitable donated moneys for cost of living expenses after a series of proceedures related to cancer. This includes putting it in savings in case there are further complications.  However it sounds like your mom has no intention to give you a cent of the money.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
