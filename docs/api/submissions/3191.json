I won't go into specifics to stay anonymous, but this is the 2nd time I've been diagnosed with a Bone Cancer. Before I was treated outpatient and this time I'm inpatient in the hospital for a full week with 24-hour chemo. It's debilitating to say the least. My family doesn't come from wealth and we barely have been above the surface even before I was diagnosed. The first treatment, we set up a gofundme and fundraisers to help pay for my treatments and surgery.\n\nMy mother said at the beginning of all this that I would never have to worry about finances. I was grateful, but knew deep down I would worry anyway. And sure enough, I did. But not about the Financials, but about her.\n\n Following my surgery, my mother finally (about 6 months into diagnosis) formed a gofundme, asking for an outrageous amount (I think $100,000) My surgery was well over $250,000, but was thankfully covered by insurance. However, we did have bills still that we had paid through other fundraising.\n\nI asked my mom how much we owed from surgery(prior to calling billing and asking for the itemized statement). My mother said that we still owed over $50,000 and she had to take money from her retirement to cover it. I actually felt guilty for getting cancer and surviving such a lengthy surgery. My mother said the gofundme would be used for my medical bills but also to pay her back for the retirement money. I later found out that insurance did cover everything and that we didn't owe/pay anything from my 15-hr limb salvage surgery. I was furious.\n\nAfter finishing chemo in April, I went back to work to pay off my medical bills and hopefully return to normal life. My mother didn't help with the financial part at all, most of my bills were close to collections and I ended up having to go into credit card debt to save my credit score from medical collections.\n\nUnfortunately, only after 6 months of remission, the cancer came back. I would be going back to chemo and amputating my leg that the cancer was in.\n\nI've been honest, telling my mother I wanted her to have no part in the financial aspect.\n\nShe's threatened to sue and remove me from her insurance. I've even tried compromising with her saying we could both be on the charitable account, gofundme, and any other sites used, of course with my direct supervison and joint ownership. But she's still upset and won't budge.\n\nI'm tempted to take my recovery time between chemo to create an account at a financial institution myself, start a gofundme without her, and start a venmo as well. I know that will make her very upset though and I don't have the capabilities to handle her that way.

I'm not sure if I read this right, but she started a GoFundMe, when most of the part she was talking about was already covered? Then you had to sort out financially the rest of the bits. Now she is threatening to sue her own daughter with a cancer diagnosis and take them off medical insurance (wwhhaaaat) if she can't be involved again. I'm so sorry that is insane.... I'm sorry what you're going through and wishing you the best for your treatment. It's obviously been tough news for your mother too but literally blackmailing you with something that's life / death is just cruel. Sorry, but your mum's is the AH here. Hopefully she will calm down and see sense soon when she can think more logically. \n\nI'm so sorry that you have a healthcare system where you have finances to worry about on top of all the stresses of having a life changing condition. Hopefully you get a GoFundMe sorted soon in whatever format to help ease that burden.

Perhaps get together a steering group so she has to share all the info. She has to be accountable to someone and it shouldn't be you. Sorry to hear about your diagnosis and I hope it goes as well as can be.", "NTA, do report her to the gofundme people asking them to keep a close eye on any financial dealings as it appears that she might be lining her pockets under the pretext which is illegal and unfair to those who contribute.", "NTA she used a gofundme to defraud people last time you had cancer and let you suffer. Do not let her anywhere near your finances. \n\nIf she\u2019s threatening to take you off your insurance when you have cancer, she sounds like a monster.", "Even if she tries to sue, the fraud she committed (or tried to commit?) before will come out and she\u2019ll end up in jail.", "We used a venmo that was largely part of the fundraising. From what I'm aware of, that was used for a good chunk of medical bills. The gofundme never went towards my bills from what I know (we raised about $1000ish) and she did admit to me that she used it for a gas bill, but then \"refunded it back to the charitable acct\". The hardest part is that she has shut me out of everything. I can see my own medical bills but nothing about the money, so I don't know what we've earned has gone towards her own bills. Hopefully that makes sense sense!", "Really, you need to get the money your mother stole from the go fund me.", "if i were donating to her gofundme, i would have no problem with OP using the money for living expenses. i would be PISSED if her mother skimmed the pot in any fashion, and it looks like her mother didn't even use it on her daughter and OP still had to pay medical bills. \n\nif i had donated to that gofundme i would be filing a lawsuit YESTERDAY", "you need to contact gofundme. your mother needs to provide receipts for EVERY SINGLE PENNY that she spent of that money. the people donating were donating to YOU and YOUR NEEDS. if it didn't go to you, then your mother is using YOUR tragedy to prey on the sympathy and generosity of people to make a profit for herself.\n\nevery single person who donated has a case against her for fraud.", "Holy shit that insane. I\u2019m so sorry you\u2019re going through this", "Ok.  You need to go to the go fund me. People and claim you don\u2019t know where the money went.

They will investigated", "Info: I'm a little confused about the medical bills. You say that insurance covered all of them, but also that you had to go into credit card debt just to pay for them. Also that your mother spent money from her retirement account to pay the bills, but that it was covered by insurance. \n\nI don't really understand the medical system in America, but is there a chance that she had to pay for things that then got refunded by her insurance, rather than just outright lying to you about having to pay it? It sounds, from the post, as if she is just blatantly stealing from you. But I always try to see the other side, as (often) the only way to a resolution is trying to understand it, rather than escalating it.", "Info\n\nI'm confused about how much was actually raised", "Nta. Report her GoFundMe if you see it.", "Yta.  All of those people donated money in good faith to your care and you let her steal it without repercussions.\n\nYour mother committed a serious financial crime.  People go to jail for this.\n\nIt's not enough to try to make sure she doesn't get to do this again.  \n\nShe should be held accountable for all of the people she stole from.", "Oh yeah. Saw a news article about an awful couple that did this to a homeless man. Got thousands donated, gave him a few hundred, and then the couple used the money to go on vacation and buy new cars.  \n\nThe homeless man sued them and they are currently paying him back. I don't remember the sentence but I'm sure it was at least a misdemeanor.", "Exactly", "So your mother threatened to murder you via withholding your insurance if you didn't let her pocket all the money people were trying to use to keep you alive.  I would blow her shit up- tell everyone, have them go to the police to hold her accountable for the fraud.  Make sure her friends, family and employer know she stole from her cancer ridden daughter, and was willing to kill her is she didn't let her do it again.", "NTA and you need therapy to help you stand up to your mother.\n\n- This woman used your cancer to commit fraud against you and countless others\n\n- Now she's \"upset\" because you won't allow her to use your cancer to commit even MORE fraud\n\n- And you're so worried about upsetting her that you've offered to let her be part of more fundraising and potentially steal again?? \n\nThis is horrible because youre at your most vulnerable and she is using your need for support and your fear of her emotions against you, just because she wants to scam people.\n\nI hope you are able to get support from other people.", "Absolutely NTA but your mom definitely is. I\u2019m so sorry you are dealing with this while battling cancer again. The fact she is so mad that she can\u2019t be involved in the fundraising is more proof that her intentions this time around are not good.

If she used that money for anything other than your treatment or care that's fraud. \n\nShe can't sue you for anything, she's being ridiculous.

But she reimbursed herself 50 thousand. For something the insurance paid in full. She threatens to take you off her insurance and sue. She needs think about fraud the way this is wrote. Keep her away from any go fund me type accounts. Hope this is your last surgery, and you go into remission and stay there.", "NTA.  Do you have another family member who can help you?  Your dad or grandparent?  Someone with leverage over your mom?\n\nYou don\u2019t need to be dealing with this on top of what is going on with your health. I am so sorry you have to deal with this.  If there\u2019s no family member who can sort this out I\u2019d go to a lawyer, not to sue but to understand your options and to put the fear of god into your mother.  \n\nAlso look into Medicare and Medicaid. In your situation you should be eligible for these and that might be a better option. Especially if you can keep your own go fund me money.", "NTA so she's using your cancer to get money for herself when people donating think it's to help you is this not fraud?", "We have the same mother? Sorry but I get it, boy do I get it.  Keep texts, emails, phone conversations with mom. Sorry but they don\u2019t change.  Put your health and safety first.", "I would threaten to post publicly every receipt of every bill and demand an accounting of every supposed payment she made from the funds raised. Absolutely put her ass on blast. And get ahead of her ass with a gofundme before she does something.", "Cancel insurance on your own kid who has cancer? Wtf? Yeah it's tell her if she tries that I'll get a lawyer to prevent that from happening and procedure to get her investigated", "So to summarise your mother is financially abusing her seriously ill child and has defrauded people on GoFundMe? You are definitely NTA. At this stage I think you need to prioritise your treatment and whatever you need ensure that\u2019s covered but once you\u2019re through that, you probably have excellent grounds for a lawsuit against your mother to recover the funds that were meant for you. GoFundMe/ the people she defrauded definitely have grounds as what she did is an offence."]}
