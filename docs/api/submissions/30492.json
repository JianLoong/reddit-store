{"id": 30492, "submission_id": "17pp79z", "title": "AITA for telling my roommate she should consider living alone because of her mental health issues?", "selftext": "My roommate (20f) and I (18f) are about 2 months in to our first semester of college. We both chose to room with someone random and ended up together in a small dorm in a very quiet building. We get along fine face-to-face for the most part, and the beginning of the year started off very well. She's a very quiet person, but is comfortable enough with me to share her history with mental health problems, and early on I agreed that every Thursday, I'd avoid the dorm for an hour so she could attend a zoom meeting with her therapist.  \nAbout a month in was when her mental health issues started affecting the way she took care of everything. We have our own separate fridges, and I began to notice every time she opened hers, I could smell something awful. When she was in class, I opened it to see what it was, and she had a container of spoiled milk and rotting fruit. Later I asked what she had in there and she showed me an apple she'd been keeping since move-in day to see how long it would take for it to rot. It disgusted me but I laughed it off and asked her politely to throw it away, and she replied with a chuckle and a \"No\". She doesn't wash her sheets EVER, leaves her trash until it\u2019s overflowing, and dumps her laundry on the floor for weeks until she finally cleans it, which doesn't help the smell.  \nShe sleeps from 7pm-11am/noon, which makes it really hard for me to be in there, since that's literally the only time I spend in the dorm. I try my best to stay quiet because I understand depression can make you sleep often and for long periods of time, but it's frustrating to have to make literally no noise and keep lights off the only time I'm in there.  \nThis evening is when she really pissed me off. She has been frequently having random zoom meetings with her therapist in addition to her weekly meeting, and doesn't tell me what time those meetings are until the night before or day of. Today she decided to tell me right before going to bed that she will be having a 1.5 hour long 9am zoom meeting that I will have to leave for. I agreed to the one weekly appointment, but I did not agree to this.  \nI've gotten so fed up with these random meetings, her CONSTANTLY needing privacy in the dorm, her inability to take care of the shared space, that I told her I think next year she should consider paying the extra money to live in a dorm by herself. I understand that depression makes you do things you're not proud of, like neglecting self care, work, chores etc., but she has no consideration for my time, my privacy, my space and my feelings. I told her if she needs this much privacy, she should either seek private study spaces out in the campus or she should get a single dorm, because it's frustrating to always have to be booted out of the room at random times on short notice every few days. I communicated with her (as kindly as I could) that if she's aware of how bad her mental health is, she shouldn't have to make someone else deal with the consequences of it.  \n", "created_utc": 1699343111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pp79z/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_she_should_consider/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This is unacceptable and not what you signed up for. Ask to be assigned another room/roommate.\n\nLeaving every Thursday was already very nice and understanding of you. She's taking advantage of your kindness. Don't put up with it.", "NTA. I had a similar situation in college. She needs to find another space for meetings that aren\u2019t at the agreed time and do the basic hygiene thing. If she can\u2019t hold to that, explain the situation to the housing office and they will likely find you other accommodations. I actually got bumped up to a better room for the same price because of the stink of my roommate\u2019s depression pit. There was mold, it was straight up affecting my health. So, come with a good argument as to how the situation is affecting your ability to study and you will likely get help with the situation.", "NTA def needs her own space", "Definitely NTA. But don't wait until next year. I would report all of this and get moved ASAP. You shouldn't have to live like this, and it is clearly starting to effect your mental health, sleep, and studies.", "NTA\n\nYou all make allowances and support the people you are living with but it's a two way street.  She is making no effort to be a good housemate and is actively making it an unpleasant place for you to live.  \n\nGive her an ultimatum and if she doesn't change force the issue.  Be prepared to have to move out yourself though as my guess is she isn't the type to do anything about it.", "NTA your very right.", "I have PTSD and chronic depression, self-care lapses included, and I\u2019m telling you what she\u2019s doing is far beyond her mouldy food. Kicking you out every other day, at her whim, is not okay.", "NTA. Her therapist meetings can take place in a room at the library, she doesn't require them to be in your room. Refuse to agree to anything but the once weekly one. She is not supposed to be sleeping 16 hours per day, that is in no depression treatment plan. No therapist would agree with anything she is doing, if she is telling you differently then she is lying to you.", "NTA. You're entitled to a comfortable living space too. You've been very understanding, but she may not realize how much her behavior affects you. This might be a wake-up call for her.", "NTA\n\nShe absolutely should not be rooming with anybody.", "NTA but you can set boundaries too. It's reasonable to have lights out from 11-8 or something but the rest of the time, live your life and she can wear headphones/eye mask if she needs to. I would personally let the therapist apps slide but that's up to you, is there another space she can use nearby? And go into her fridge and throw everything out, it's not your job, but you still have to smell it.", "NTA, but isn't there someone like a supervisor or facilities manager you can talk to about the unhealthy situation she is putting you in? Mental health issues aside, she's simply a filthy person.", "NTA. I have severe OCD, so severe that I absolutely cannot live with anyone other than a partner, and I mean *anyone*. My own parents couldn\u2019t live with me. Even partners find it a struggle. \n\nI know my mental illness makes me unbearable to live with and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always lived alone, even though it\u2019s far more expensive and I\u2019ll never own a house, because I\u2019ve been paying my full share of rent since age 17. It wouldn\u2019t make someone ableist or an asshole to say \u201cI cannot live under these conditions\u201d.", "NT\nBut it's time you escalated this to whoever is in charge. You also need to stop walking on eggshells around her and live your life.  Your roommates actions arw having a negative impact on your ability to use your dorm and live your life. If this is completely a mental health issue and not controlling and manipulative behavior then she needs extra supports that may be helped by those in charge knowing about her issues.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

NTA btw, you are being way more patient than I would be. For the remaining time maybe you could compromise and you keep your earbuds or earplugs in while she is having the meetings, that way you won\u2019t be listening but also you won\u2019t have to be kicked out of your own dorm", "So let\u2019s get this all straight she\u2019s; leaving trash overflowing, dirty laundry all over the floor, intentionally keeping rotting food, sleeping from 7pm-11am/noon (not allowing you to use your own living space) & expecting you to regularly and randomly completely leave the room for her privacy.\nStart documenting EVERYTHING, take pictures of the messes and write down any time she prevents you using the room if she\u2019s sleeping or just telling you to leave. Go to your RA and request a room change do not wait this out the whole year! NTA", "Some people are just slobs, so the filth may have nothing to do with her mental health issues. Also, why is everything on her terms? You're paying rent too. I'd ask to move.", "Definitely NTA. Maybe N A H.", "NTA and you shouldn't feel obligated to follow her rules for your shared space. Leaving for an hour 1/week is reasonable. Vacating every time she wants to talk to her therapist and keeping things dark and quiet for 18 hours a day is not. She needs to find a new place now, not next year.", "this is the answer NTA", "You shouldn\u2019t be talking at all in a library", "If they\u2019re in university, the campus library will almost certainly have private study rooms where talking is permitted. From my experience with using them, they\u2019re typically not soundproof so I can understand why they may not be someone\u2019s first choice for therapy but, then again, neither are dorm rooms."]}
