{"id": 30492, "submission_id": "17pp79z", "title": "AITA for telling my roommate she should consider living alone because of her mental health issues?", "selftext": "My roommate (20f) and I (18f) are about 2 months in to our first semester of college. We both chose to room with someone random and ended up together in a small dorm in a very quiet building. We get along fine face-to-face for the most part, and the beginning of the year started off very well. She's a very quiet person, but is comfortable enough with me to share her history with mental health problems, and early on I agreed that every Thursday, I'd avoid the dorm for an hour so she could attend a zoom meeting with her therapist.  \nAbout a month in was when her mental health issues started affecting the way she took care of everything. We have our own separate fridges, and I began to notice every time she opened hers, I could smell something awful. When she was in class, I opened it to see what it was, and she had a container of spoiled milk and rotting fruit. Later I asked what she had in there and she showed me an apple she'd been keeping since move-in day to see how long it would take for it to rot. It disgusted me but I laughed it off and asked her politely to throw it away, and she replied with a chuckle and a \"No\". She doesn't wash her sheets EVER, leaves her trash until it\u2019s overflowing, and dumps her laundry on the floor for weeks until she finally cleans it, which doesn't help the smell.  \nShe sleeps from 7pm-11am/noon, which makes it really hard for me to be in there, since that's literally the only time I spend in the dorm. I try my best to stay quiet because I understand depression can make you sleep often and for long periods of time, but it's frustrating to have to make literally no noise and keep lights off the only time I'm in there.  \nThis evening is when she really pissed me off. She has been frequently having random zoom meetings with her therapist in addition to her weekly meeting, and doesn't tell me what time those meetings are until the night before or day of. Today she decided to tell me right before going to bed that she will be having a 1.5 hour long 9am zoom meeting that I will have to leave for. I agreed to the one weekly appointment, but I did not agree to this.  \nI've gotten so fed up with these random meetings, her CONSTANTLY needing privacy in the dorm, her inability to take care of the shared space, that I told her I think next year she should consider paying the extra money to live in a dorm by herself. I understand that depression makes you do things you're not proud of, like neglecting self care, work, chores etc., but she has no consideration for my time, my privacy, my space and my feelings. I told her if she needs this much privacy, she should either seek private study spaces out in the campus or she should get a single dorm, because it's frustrating to always have to be booted out of the room at random times on short notice every few days. I communicated with her (as kindly as I could) that if she's aware of how bad her mental health is, she shouldn't have to make someone else deal with the consequences of it.  \n", "created_utc": 1699343111, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17pp79z/aita_for_telling_my_roommate_she_should_consider/", "score": 262, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Kicking you out every other day, at her whim, is not okay.", "NTA. Her therapist meetings can take place in a room at the library, she doesn't require them to be in your room. Refuse to agree to anything but the once weekly one. She is not supposed to be sleeping 16 hours per day, that is in no depression treatment plan. No therapist would agree with anything she is doing, if she is telling you differently then she is lying to you.", "NTA. You're entitled to a comfortable living space too. You've been very understanding, but she may not realize how much her behavior affects you. This might be a wake-up call for her.", "NTA\n\nShe absolutely should not be rooming with anybody.", "NTA but you can set boundaries too. It's reasonable to have lights out from 11-8 or something but the rest of the time, live your life and she can wear headphones/eye mask if she needs to. I would personally let the therapist apps slide but that's up to you, is there another space she can use nearby? And go into her fridge and throw everything out, it's not your job, but you still have to smell it.", "NTA, but isn't there someone like a supervisor or facilities manager you can talk to about the unhealthy situation she is putting you in? Mental health issues aside, she's simply a filthy person.", "NTA. I have severe OCD, so severe that I absolutely cannot live with anyone other than a partner, and I mean *anyone*. My own parents couldn\u2019t live with me. Even partners find it a struggle. \n\nI know my mental illness makes me unbearable to live with and that\u2019s why I\u2019ve always lived alone, even though it\u2019s far more expensive and I\u2019ll never own a house, because I\u2019ve been paying my full share of rent since age 17.

NTA btw, you are being way more patient than I would be. For the remaining time maybe you could compromise and you keep your earbuds or earplugs in while she is having the meetings, that way you won\u2019t be listening but also you won\u2019t have to be kicked out of your own dorm", "So let\u2019s get this all straight she\u2019s; leaving trash overflowing, dirty laundry all over the floor, intentionally keeping rotting food, sleeping from 7pm-11am/noon (not allowing you to use your own living space) & expecting you to regularly and randomly completely leave the room for her privacy.\nStart documenting EVERYTHING, take pictures of the messes and write down any time she prevents you using the room if she\u2019s sleeping or just telling you to leave. Go to your RA and request a room change do not wait this out the whole year! NTA", "Some people are just slobs, so the filth may have nothing to do with her mental health issues. Also, why is everything on her terms? You're paying rent too. I'd ask to move.", "Definitely NTA. Maybe N A H.", "NTA and you shouldn't feel obligated to follow her rules for your shared space. Leaving for an hour 1/week is reasonable. Vacating every time she wants to talk to her therapist and keeping things dark and quiet for 18 hours a day is not. She needs to find a new place now, not next year.", "this is the answer NTA", "You shouldn\u2019t be talking at all in a library", "If they\u2019re in university, the campus library will almost certainly have private study rooms where talking is permitted. From my experience with using them, they\u2019re typically not soundproof so I can understand why they may not be someone\u2019s first choice for therapy but, then again, neither are dorm rooms.", "NTA.\n\nGo to your housing leader in your dormitory or college.  You deserve a better place to live, and she's not a fit roommate.", "NTA You don't have to be subjected to living like this. Talk to the RA and ask for a reassignment.", "That\u2019s not just depression if she\u2019s deliberately leaving things to rot. Something else is wrong in addition to the depression. Agreed with other responders to talk to your dorm/housing manager", "NTA\n\nVery clearly NTA. \nHer appointments are her responsibility, you should not have to leave the room you pay for.", "NTA regarding the therapy: she's the one who needs the appointments and privacy, she can find her own private space. Also, report her to the RA. She's a biohazard, hygienic risk and I can't imagine the college wants to clean up an infestation", "NTA - but don\u2019t wait. There is no reason YOU should have to tolerate this behaviour, this lack of consideration or these living conditions. Go to the accommodation office and demand a new room or new room mate and ask for a rebate for having had this inflicted on you for so long.", "As someone who is dealing with mental health and knows I am not in a good space I refuse to get into a relationship right now because I know my mentality and home life would not be good for another person to deal with.My point in saying this is that I know I'd have to be considerate of other people.The fact that you were considerate of therapy times needed and everything is nice of you,but you also have to live there.I have stayed in places before where I have to walk on eggshells around others and I can't imagine that plus dealing with school.I agree with the commenter who said to talk to your advisor, because if it's this bad at two months in and you aren't comfortable it'll only get worse.NTA", "NTA report her. She needs to be institutionalized", "NTA. Don\u2019t suffer all year \u2014 you do not have to live like this. Depression is not a license to pull everyone around down too. \n\nMy sophomore year I had a similar roommate situation. I spoke with the RD and she was moved into a single for the second semester. He also felt so bad about how horrible the situation was, he didn\u2019t move a new person in, so me and my other roommate (triple) had an enormous room to ourselves and a very fun second semester hosting out of town friends in the extra space. \n\nI hope you\u2019re able to get a better room situation asap!! This doesn\u2019t sound healthy and I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re dealing with that.", "NTA. This is fair and so would reporting it to a RA or higher to get some help.", "NTA \n\ni AM that roommate. When I was in college, and still now (I live with housemates) I struggled massively with my mental health, particularly depression. I slept all day, couldn\u2019t take care of myself or my room, it was so messy it made me cry to just look at it, and cry more at the thought of cleaning it. \n\nHowever, you best believe I never make any of my housemates pay for it. I sleep all day - that's my issue, and I would never ask any of my housemates to be quiet, and I never get annoyed or frustrated when they interrupt my nap at 2pm because they're just living their lives. I know I'm messy and struggle to keep things clean, so I limit my time and belongings in shared spaces so that issue never affects my housemates. I'd never kick them out of the house, it's my responsibility to find a place for therapy sessions, and you've been more than considerate to agree to leave for her scheduled weekly sessions. \n\nI feel for her and understand her struggle, but it's HER struggle, and not your burden to bear. You were well within your rights to say that. Don't feel bad!!", "NTA. I think you have communicated your concerns in a mature, considerate way, and I think you are right. She needs to be on her own. The way she is running things just isn't fair to you.", "NTA.\n\nMental illnesses are the responsibility of the afflicted to deal with. If they're outsourcing that responsibility to everyone around them, it's just abuse. Your roommate is abusive.", "NTA. Depression is not an excuse to be inconsiderate to others. She clearly needs a new therapist as well as living on her own.", "NTA. Mental health is not an excuse to be an inconsiderate person. I find those kinds of people very tricky to deal with and tend to just avoid them if possible", "NTA", "Seek out your RA and asked to switch rooms. This isn\u2019t okay. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou need to speak up to the Housing Office about the issues you have with the room, though, including her laundry issue, the smell, and her telling you to leave at such short notice.  It isn\u2019t fair to you.   \nHousing can move her mid-year if she needs a single for her own mental health,", "You need to contact your RA and tell them about the rotting food. This is a health hazard and she needs to be made to clean it up.", "She can put on headphones for her zoom meeting.   You can put on headphones to listen to music while doing whatever you are doing during her meeting.  I don't see why you have to leave each time she meets with her therapist.", "NTA OP, I had to deal with a mentally ill college roommate 20 something years ago. I went the random route my first year of college and my first roommate was okay, but her friend who was waitlisted got in at the last minute so they asked me to swap roommates so she could live with her friend. I said okay because her friend\u2019s roommate seemed okay and we all had just moved in anyway. Anyhow, unbeknownst to me my new roommate was in mood stabilizing meds. She was bipolar and would sometimes do crazy things like program my computer to replace the word and with the word moo and mess up my work or wake me up by hitting me with the cordless phone because I didn\u2019t wake up early to tell her to go to class. Or she\u2019d get us in trouble due to her parting when she was in a good mood or couldn\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t let her boyfriend store and deal drugs out of our dorm room. It was insane. I honestly think that mental health disclosures should be a thing when roommates are assigned. It\u2019s not fair otherwise for someone who is just trying to get an education to have a stranger\u2019s mental health issues foisted upon them. In my case, I tried to swap back but they wouldn\u2019t let me and I was stuck because there were no other places available. Your roommate needed to be told this but I\u2019d be checking for other room options if possible.", "One has to wonder if perhaps OP's roommate is consciously (or not) doing this to drive her out. Also, one has to wonder if she is really having all these Zoom meetings with a therapist or if it is another tactic (besides filth) to drive OP out.", "NTA.", "Sleeping for 17 hours on the regular is beyond not ok, especially in a shared space. I got queasy reading this, the filth is also unacceptable. I\u2019d urgently report it, and I\u2019d be adamant that you can no longer live this way.", "I actually did think about this, but I do really think it's all genuine. I think the frequent random zoom calls are to help her find a new therapist because her regular one is going to stop seeing her in a few months. I also don't think she's trying to drive me out because she doesn't have anything to gain from it. Obviously I'm biased but I really think I've been super patient with her and I know I don't spend much time in the room at all except to sleep and study on rare occasion, and I keep my side clean and everything. I really can't think of anything I've done up until this point that would make her want me gone (more than I already am), and even if I did move out, there's a housing crisis at my school and someone random would quickly take my place (and she knows that).", "I've also been questioning wether she even has therapy sessions that often. No offense, but therapy several times a week on short notice? Unheard of. Best you can do at this rate is to get out of there before you become liable for some of the damage she has caused.", "Every University library has private study rooms. Roomie can book one or claim a room for her meetings", "how is it possible to sleep 16 to  17 hours per day? Even at my lowest mental health, I didn't even manage 8 hours, let alone 16 to 17 hours. That is absolutely insane.", "Our bodies react differently. My cousin's mom died recently and my cousin didnt take to it well and has told me she just wants to sleep all the time.", "When my meds were messed up and I had a few other deficiencies I was sleeping 11 hrs at night then taking a 4 hr nap. When my lab results came in my Dr said she was surprised I was able to keep my job or even that I was awake now.   \n\nI had basically every deficiency that makes you tired.", "I slept that much with my first baby in the 2 weeks leading up to his birth. He was premature, not sure why I couldn't stay awake. I was off work for maternity leave and on strict bed rest. With my second I still slept like 10-12 hours just before I went into labor. (Napping when the older one did) And had far less complications.\n\nETA: I agree that months of prolonged sleep is an issue and OP shouldn't cater to 100% of their needs. It will harm their own mental health", "The more you sleep the more tired you get, so it's a pretty bad feedback loop.  Especially if you are depressed and therefore having a hard time getting out of  bed.", "I used to when my depression was really bad, laying in bed was my safe space and sleeping keeps the thoughts away.", "I once slept almost one full day (24 hours). It is insane, but my case it was a mix of physical and mental fatigue, so my body and mind just shut down. These days depression \"just\" makes me unable to wake up in the morning, I have to drag myself out of bed so I can start working.", "I guess I could see that, sometimes sleep is good because if you\u2019re asleep, you don't feel the stabbing emotional pain."]}
