OP isn't saying \"OUR parents kicked him out\" OP is saying \"HIS parents kicked him out\" which is really weird if they're siblings with the same parents.", "It has nothing to do with them kicking him out, it's that referring to them as 'his parents' in the context of this post implies they are exclusively his, and people tend to share parents with their siblings.", "I think the bit that\u2019s odd is that op refers to him as her brother, but then doesn\u2019t say \u201cour\u201d parents, op says \u201chis\u201d parents. Typically siblings share parents", "I think the odd phrasing is her calling her brother's parents \"his parents\" instead of \"our parents\".
