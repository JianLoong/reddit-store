{"id": 13182, "submission_id": "121uyut", "title": "AITA for kicking my son out for how he treated his mom?", "selftext": "I (53f) and my wife \"Abby\" (50f) have been together for over 30 years, and married for 20). We adopted our son \"Jack\" when he was a toddler after his parents had died. He is now 20. \n\nBringing him up wasn't without its difficulties but in all he was a good kid. Good grades, good judgement, didn't cause trouble on purpose. He always loved spending time with us, watching tv with us, and in his teen years he even began cooking with us and became somewhat of a Gordan Ramsey. \n\nI noticed things changed a bit after we adopted our daughter at the age of 7 \"Sam\" (he was 15) - she was a troubled kid, bounced around a lot in the foster care system. For a while he loved her and really enjoyed being around her and showing her that this house was safe, which was basically all the things my wife and I were trying to do. I want it to be clear that we never asked him to be a parent, that was our job. He always offered to do things with her and would often choose to be around her rather than his friends. He never had to babysit her, but he did on occasion during small emergencies. He seemed slightly annoyed with her, but always told us that it was just a bit frustrating to deal with her sometimes.\n\nFor info, when I say Sam was troubled, I mean she'd hide food, hide herself, and shut down a lot. There was no violence or anger. We still deal with the echoes of some of this today. We do have her in therapy to this day, and she's much better.\n\nSoon after his 19th birthday he met a girl (18 at the time) and his personality began to change. He grew resentful of us, of Sam. He'd make these weird or hostile comments toward Abby or me, and occasionally I'd catch him telling Sam about her bio family. I'd always try to shut it down, but he'd make some excuse and go home when I tried to talk to him. I don't want Sam getting into contact with her family - it's a toxic family that was no good and very dangerous for her. \n\nEarlier today me and the wife were speaking to him about his behavior, and he said that his gf told us that we 'kept him from his family' on purpose during his entire upbringing, and that adoption was a traumatizing experience that tore families apart. This stunned us, since we were always as transparent as we could be - what remained of his family didn't want to talk to him and that's why we adopted him. My wife tried to explain that we never tried to do that, he called her a lying bitch and to shut up, and that we're 'babysnatchers'. Immediately I cut in and told him to leave and not come back unless its to apologize. \n\nHe left, saying that he hoped one day Sam wisened up to us lying about her family as well. That we were awful for ripping a girl away from her real family.\n\nI don't understand his logic but he was clearly upset at us for what we did. I wish I hadn't kicked him out so we could have talked it through but he was just throwing verbal abuse at the woman who cared for him most of his life and I couldn't watch it. \n\nReddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679769576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121uyut/aita_for_kicking_my_son_out_for_how_he_treated/", "score": 74, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you've been saying and doing all the right things where both kids are concerned.  Also, by age 20, he should have much better control over his actions and words.  He had no right to talk to you like this.  Hell, by the age of 6 I knew better than to talk to my parents this way.\n\nI don't think you should backtrack at all on the ultimatum.  If he gets in touch, you can be relieved or happy, etc, but stay firm on your rule.  He still has to apologize and it has to be heartfelt.  No throwaway stuff like \"alright, alright, I'm sorry\".  He needs to know WHY he's sorry and the apology should reflect this.\n\nAlso, something else might be going on with him.  Not an excuse but maybe an explanation.", "NTA!\n\nYour son's girlfriend certainly is though! I wonder where she got her \"information\"? A tiktok video maybe? Hopefully he comes to his senses soon. Meanwhile I would keep him away from Sam. She's had enough trauma in her life. She does not need him adding to is feeding her toxic BS", "NTA", "NTA. You're right about this being the girlfriend\u2019s influence, since he\u2019s brought her up during his statements. Hopefully, he\u2019ll see through her soon, and things can return to normal. She sounds toxic. Your wife will most likely get an apology once gf is out of the picture. Please be patient with him, and let him know that although you don\u2019t agree with what he said, you still love him.", "NTA\n\nYour priority right now is to protect your daughter. Jack is double threat to her - first, he pushes her towards a toxic family, and secondly - he ruins a stable, safe home she so desperately needs. In this situation he's the agressor, she's the victim. He needs to take responsibility for his behavior because I doubt he would feel responsible if Sam was hurt as a result of his actions", "NTA, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Is there an extended family member your son trusts that can talk to your son?  Would he agree to family counseling?  \n\nI'm guessing his girlfriend is an expert at exploiting his insecurities, which lends toward sychopathic tendencies. While not wanting to diagnose her, I can't think of another way to describe this level of manipulation. It seems that the girlfriend is enjoying the turmoil she has created. \n\nIt may be best to maintain firm boundaries but refuse any drama. Hopefully, she will get bored with your son when you don't feed her drama jones.", "NTA, but I think you made a mistake. Your son seems to have gone down a bit of a rabbit hole ... I know the whole \"adoption tears families apart\" issue has gained some traction in recent years. I'm not in a place to speak about what may be actual instances of this, but this certainly was not the case in your adopting your son. \n\nIt's almost as if your son has gotten into the Q theory of adoption. What he said to his mother and you was vile. Was your response perfect? I don't know. But I'm not sure you're doing your relationship any favors with the \"and don't come back until\" line. I don't know how to handle people like your son, who seem to have gotten sucked into a conspiracy theory. Best of luck in dealing with this situation: you sound like very decent people.", "I am going to go with a soft NAH here. You seem to be trying to do what's best for your kids here, but it's absolutely true that adoption, even in to a loving, stable family, is traumatic. It just doesn't happen when everyone's having a good day. It's also true that you adopted your kids. You committed to being their parents and it's incredibly fucking normal for people reaching young adulthood to be pretty angry for a while about how things were for them growing up. \n\nThere's a lot of resources out there from adult adoptees and birth parents that might help you and your family get to a better place. Shutting it down and assuming that you did your best, end of story, isn't how you solve serious family conflicts. Your kids didn't ask to be adopted. They're the only people in this entire situation who had absolutely no control over what happened to them or where they lived. The rejection your son must feel has got to be terrible. It was very uncool to tell your son that his birth family didn't want him. Even if they didn't, that's still a huge loss, not justification for your choices. He might need you to love him through this anger and look at your past in a different way.\n\nEdit: I do want to apologize if I misread something, OP. It sounded like you told your son that his birth family don't speak with him as you were having an argument. Reading it back, that might not be what happened. Hopefully you can all heal from this. Best of luck.", "INFO : Were his parents from a different cultural background? I've heard of people having adoption discourse on Twitter and Tumblr, but it was always in context of uprooting the child, not just adopting an orphan, and especially not removing a child from abusive home. NTA anyway, but that would at least explain where it came from.", "NTA\nWhile adoption can be traumatising and very problematic, it is not necessarily so. Seems like your son didn't have issues with this before his gf put a flea into his ear.", "NTA. But your son will have to find out the truth (that he wasn't wanted) or deal with that one way or another. Sounds to me his girlfriend is against adoption. That is pretty awful.", "ESH\n\nDisclaimer: I'm adopted. \n\nAdopted kids have some complex feelings that can be difficult to articulate, much less do anything about. It is not unusual to think about the family you \"should have\" had, to feel like you lost out on something everyone else got to have. Something normal and basic and expected: your biological parents. \n\nYour son is most likely *grieving* for the family he didn't have.\n\nIt's not a rational thing. His biological parents are dead. You didn't \"take\" them. But he still has grief. His extended biological family didn't want him, either. That hurts.\n\nAs an adopted kid, I didn't even realize how much grief I was carrying until the day I tracked down my biological father and learned that *he* had never wanted to give me up. Yes, he was such an awful person that the courts took me away from him and denied his paternity and all, but *I hadn't been unwanted.* I was loved. \n\nThat was like having this weight taken from my shoulders that I had no idea I was carrying.\n\nYour son will never get that experience, obviously. But he has other family that didn't or couldn't take him in. And he has a little sister who obviously went through a lot of trauma and does have a biological family out there that--honestly I don't know--might love her despite being awful people.\n\nFor the record, I love my adoptive family with all my heart. They gave me everything. I have never resented them. But everyone processes their emotions differently and these things are complicated.\n\nYou guys need to have a *real* conversation with your kid. Not an angry stormy blow up with name calling and house kicking. I get that your kid was and is being an AH and you were very hurt and defending yourselves. \n\nBut now is the time to reach out and begin repairing the breach. Offer to be honest and talk about everything, so long as everyone is polite. Recognize that your son has some nasty feelings right now without blaming him or his GF (she's a toxic busybody AH but she's his TBBAH so he won't see that for now.) \n\nIt may be easier to do all of this and keep the nasty emotions from running rampant by doing this in writing. I think being very thorough and clearing the air about the circumstances surrounding his and his sister's adoption could go a long way toward helping him heal.\n\nYour son is also dealing with the totally normal process of becoming an adult and learning to negotiate the parent-child relationship as an adult, which can also be hard.\n\nGood luck; I know you love your kids and want the best for them.", "NTA. He has fallen in with a narcissist. classic isolate to control.", "Heartbreaking! NTA, OP. His gf must really be a character to disect and render a judgment about something she knows nothing about; it's concerning and hopefully you will be able to get past this at some point. No one is capable of hurting us more than our children. Perhaps you could start preparing a file, of sorts, for your son with all of the information, reports and legal documents from his pre adoption life and the time you took him home. He may not be receptive now but you can get ready for questions at some point. Someone is telling him a story that he wants to believe but it will fall apart since it's a lie. Best wishes.", "No, because he earned that. You should never bite the hand that feeds you and he bit hard.", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We've not been the most perfect moms but I really dont understand what happened. He always talked with my wife, called her mommy until he was ten.

I could ask his aunt (really just my best friend) as he also had a close relationship with her but I don't know if she'd have any more success.", "Its true that we told him his family didn't really want him. Its harsh I agree, but the alternative was him finding out himself and being hurt worse. My wife didn't want to keep any info from him that could have just him worse if we kept it from him. \n\nThe only people who wanted him from his family were his parents, and they died. It was so tragic.", "Really wise words. OP is doing his (edit: her. Missed that part and heteronormative thinking took over) best clearly but this needs more love not anger and demands. \n\nthere are ALOT of problems with adoption, especially international adoptions. And kids will most likely at some point get angry with their parents, adopted or biological, over their life. Love him through this.", "The parents are not the ones at fault here. If it weren't for them sounds like he would have been bouncing around in the system. He should have some gratitude. But I'm sure he will be back when he needs a college fund, house deposit, thinks about his inheritance. But with that attitude, they would do well to cut him off.", "We were friends for a few years.

We never tried to keep him from his culture, but maybe we could have tried harder to help him learn?", "Thank you, I never thought of it like this. The worst I've had was a stepdad, and he was a decent man himself. \n\nIf he's willing to listen to me, I'll talk to him.

There you go, his gf isa big homophobe and putting ideas in his head he's clearly believing.", "The family that didn\u2019t want him after his parents died.  NTA, but be patient.  The new GF is putting all sorts of toxic thoughts into him.  Hopefully, at some point he\u2019ll wake up.", "I think there might be an element of homophobia in there too with the girlfriend. Isn\u2019t the whole gay people kidnap babies when they adopt them a whole talking point of the conservatives in America?", "You don't need to describe him as the \"enemy\", that's taking it too far.\n\nGo down the neutral route. Her brother is going through a lot of emotions right now and it's making him lash out in anger against the people close to him. Sam herself may find she has similar emotions as she grows up, especially when she's going through puberty.\n\nAnd while you don't agree with taking that anger out on people close to you, you still love your son and will welcome him home with open arms once he's had time to calm down and reflect. You can't tell her when that will be, it could be weeks, months, or even years, because that's how big those feelings can be. In the meantime she can still talk to you about her brother, but it's best if you all give him space to work through these feelings, so she won't be seeing him for a while.\n\nShe needs to know that if she goes through something similar then she'll still have you guys as her safe space. You're not going to chuck her out or return her to social services. You will still be her Mums, but sometimes space is needed for all parties. That's the lesson she needs to draw from this.", "Just be honest and tell her he\u2019s not in your lives now and you won\u2019t ever see him again", "You can only try. But please try not to take ownership of your son's issues. Try not to let his issues change you too much.", "That incredibly sad. I don't want and am not asking for information about your son's past. I would like to suggest that if that's true it's probably easier for him to think that someone forced this than that his family didn't want him. He may also simply believe you're wrong. People are allowed to be wrong. My bigger point was that it sounds like your son is looking at his life through a lens he hadn't previously been aware of and he's working out what he thinks. If your goal is a close, respectful relationship with him, you two need to apologize to each other and you owe it to him to at least hear him out on his thoughts about adoption.", "I know it would hurt him, but he is hurt now, regardless. It really is not the best contemporary practice to keep adult adoptees from finding out about their families - even the nasty, negative elements. They have a right to know. \n\nI just want you to have some relief that what you\u2019re going through really does happen a lot, developmentally, for blended and adopted families at the age your son is.

They're a two mom family.", ">If it weren't for them sounds like he would have been bouncing around in the system. He should have some gratitude.\n\nAbsolutely not. These children had no control over the events that lead to their leaving their birth families and didn't ask for or consent to their adoptions. Why on Earth should they lead lives of eternal gratitude? I mean, hopefully parents get it more right than wrong and their kids respect them, but in no way are adopted people obligated to be especially thankful. The couple here wanted children and didn't or couldn't produce any of their own. They are the parties least traumatized by the events that lead to the adoptions and the ones who had the most power to choose the outcome.", "Thank you. I'll definitely think on this before we talk to her.", "He's my baby boy. I can't help but feel at least partially responsible for what happened.

It really is not the best contemporary practice to keep adult adoptees from finding out about their families - even the nasty, negative elements. They have a right to know.
