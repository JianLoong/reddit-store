We adopted our son \"Jack\" when he was a toddler after his parents had died. He is now 20. \n\nBringing him up wasn't without its difficulties but in all he was a good kid. Good grades, good judgement, didn't cause trouble on purpose. He always loved spending time with us, watching tv with us, and in his teen years he even began cooking with us and became somewhat of a Gordan Ramsey. \n\nI noticed things changed a bit after we adopted our daughter at the age of 7 \"Sam\" (he was 15) - she was a troubled kid, bounced around a lot in the foster care system. For a while he loved her and really enjoyed being around her and showing her that this house was safe, which was basically all the things my wife and I were trying to do. I want it to be clear that we never asked him to be a parent, that was our job. He always offered to do things with her and would often choose to be around her rather than his friends. He never had to babysit her, but he did on occasion during small emergencies. He seemed slightly annoyed with her, but always told us that it was just a bit frustrating to deal with her sometimes.\n\nFor info, when I say Sam was troubled, I mean she'd hide food, hide herself, and shut down a lot. There was no violence or anger. We still deal with the echoes of some of this today. We do have her in therapy to this day, and she's much better.\n\nSoon after his 19th birthday he met a girl (18 at the time) and his personality began to change. He grew resentful of us, of Sam. He'd make these weird or hostile comments toward Abby or me, and occasionally I'd catch him telling Sam about her bio family. I'd always try to shut it down, but he'd make some excuse and go home when I tried to talk to him. I don't want Sam getting into contact with her family - it's a toxic family that was no good and very dangerous for her. \n\nEarlier today me and the wife were speaking to him about his behavior, and he said that his gf told us that we 'kept him from his family' on purpose during his entire upbringing, and that adoption was a traumatizing experience that tore families apart. This stunned us, since we were always as transparent as we could be - what remained of his family didn't want to talk to him and that's why we adopted him. My wife tried to explain that we never tried to do that, he called her a lying bitch and to shut up, and that we're 'babysnatchers'. Immediately I cut in and told him to leave and not come back unless its to apologize. \n\nHe left, saying that he hoped one day Sam wisened up to us lying about her family as well. That we were awful for ripping a girl away from her real family.\n\nI don't understand his logic but he was clearly upset at us for what we did. I wish I hadn't kicked him out so we could have talked it through but he was just throwing verbal abuse at the woman who cared for him most of his life and I couldn't watch it. \n\nReddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679769576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121uyut/aita_for_kicking_my_son_out_for_how_he_treated/", "score": 741, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you've been saying and doing all the right things where both kids are concerned.  Also, by age 20, he should have much better control over his actions and words.  He had no right to talk to you like this.  Hell, by the age of 6 I knew better than to talk to my parents this way.\n\nI don't think you should backtrack at all on the ultimatum.  If he gets in touch, you can be relieved or happy, etc, but stay firm on your rule.  He still has to apologize and it has to be heartfelt.  No throwaway stuff like \"alright, alright, I'm sorry\".  He needs to know WHY he's sorry and the apology should reflect this.\n\nAlso, something else might be going on with him.  Not an excuse but maybe an explanation.", "NTA!\n\nYour son's girlfriend certainly is though! I wonder where she got her \"information\"? A tiktok video maybe? Hopefully he comes to his senses soon.

You're right about this being the girlfriend\u2019s influence, since he\u2019s brought her up during his statements. Hopefully, he\u2019ll see through her soon, and things can return to normal. She sounds toxic. Your wife will most likely get an apology once gf is out of the picture. Please be patient with him, and let him know that although you don\u2019t agree with what he said, you still love him.", "NTA\n\nYour priority right now is to protect your daughter. Jack is double threat to her - first, he pushes her towards a toxic family, and secondly - he ruins a stable, safe home she so desperately needs. In this situation he's the agressor, she's the victim. He needs to take responsibility for his behavior because I doubt he would feel responsible if Sam was hurt as a result of his actions", "NTA, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Is there an extended family member your son trusts that can talk to your son?  Would he agree to family counseling?  \n\nI'm guessing his girlfriend is an expert at exploiting his insecurities, which lends toward sychopathic tendencies. While not wanting to diagnose her, I can't think of another way to describe this level of manipulation. It seems that the girlfriend is enjoying the turmoil she has created. \n\nIt may be best to maintain firm boundaries but refuse any drama. Hopefully, she will get bored with your son when you don't feed her drama jones.", "NTA, but I think you made a mistake. Your son seems to have gone down a bit of a rabbit hole ... I know the whole \"adoption tears families apart\" issue has gained some traction in recent years. I'm not in a place to speak about what may be actual instances of this, but this certainly was not the case in your adopting your son. \n\nIt's almost as if your son has gotten into the Q theory of adoption. What he said to his mother and you was vile. Was your response perfect? I don't know. But I'm not sure you're doing your relationship any favors with the \"and don't come back until\" line. I don't know how to handle people like your son, who seem to have gotten sucked into a conspiracy theory. Best of luck in dealing with this situation: you sound like very decent people.", "I am going to go with a soft NAH here. You seem to be trying to do what's best for your kids here, but it's absolutely true that adoption, even in to a loving, stable family, is traumatic. It just doesn't happen when everyone's having a good day. It's also true that you adopted your kids. You committed to being their parents and it's incredibly fucking normal for people reaching young adulthood to be pretty angry for a while about how things were for them growing up. \n\nThere's a lot of resources out there from adult adoptees and birth parents that might help you and your family get to a better place. Shutting it down and assuming that you did your best, end of story, isn't how you solve serious family conflicts. Your kids didn't ask to be adopted. They're the only people in this entire situation who had absolutely no control over what happened to them or where they lived. The rejection your son must feel has got to be terrible. It was very uncool to tell your son that his birth family didn't want him. Even if they didn't, that's still a huge loss, not justification for your choices. He might need you to love him through this anger and look at your past in a different way.\n\nEdit: I do want to apologize if I misread something, OP. It sounded like you told your son that his birth family don't speak with him as you were having an argument. Reading it back, that might not be what happened. Hopefully you can all heal from this. Best of luck.", "INFO : Were his parents from a different cultural background? I've heard of people having adoption discourse on Twitter and Tumblr, but it was always in context of uprooting the child, not just adopting an orphan, and especially not removing a child from abusive home. NTA anyway, but that would at least explain where it came from.", "NTA\nWhile adoption can be traumatising and very problematic, it is not necessarily so. Seems like your son didn't have issues with this before his gf put a flea into his ear.", "NTA. But your son will have to find out the truth (that he wasn't wanted) or deal with that one way or another. Sounds to me his girlfriend is against adoption. That is pretty awful.", "ESH\n\nDisclaimer: I'm adopted. \n\nAdopted kids have some complex feelings that can be difficult to articulate, much less do anything about. It is not unusual to think about the family you \"should have\" had, to feel like you lost out on something everyone else got to have. Something normal and basic and expected: your biological parents. \n\nYour son is most likely *grieving* for the family he didn't have.\n\nIt's not a rational thing. His biological parents are dead. You didn't \"take\" them. But he still has grief. His extended biological family didn't want him, either. That hurts.\n\nAs an adopted kid, I didn't even realize how much grief I was carrying until the day I tracked down my biological father and learned that *he* had never wanted to give me up. Yes, he was such an awful person that the courts took me away from him and denied his paternity and all, but *I hadn't been unwanted.* I was loved. \n\nThat was like having this weight taken from my shoulders that I had no idea I was carrying.\n\nYour son will never get that experience, obviously. But he has other family that didn't or couldn't take him in. And he has a little sister who obviously went through a lot of trauma and does have a biological family out there that--honestly I don't know--might love her despite being awful people.\n\nFor the record, I love my adoptive family with all my heart. They gave me everything. I have never resented them. But everyone processes their emotions differently and these things are complicated.\n\nYou guys need to have a *real* conversation with your kid. Not an angry stormy blow up with name calling and house kicking. I get that your kid was and is being an AH and you were very hurt and defending yourselves. \n\nBut now is the time to reach out and begin repairing the breach. Offer to be honest and talk about everything, so long as everyone is polite. Recognize that your son has some nasty feelings right now without blaming him or his GF (she's a toxic busybody AH but she's his TBBAH so he won't see that for now.) \n\nIt may be easier to do all of this and keep the nasty emotions from running rampant by doing this in writing. I think being very thorough and clearing the air about the circumstances surrounding his and his sister's adoption could go a long way toward helping him heal.\n\nYour son is also dealing with the totally normal process of becoming an adult and learning to negotiate the parent-child relationship as an adult, which can also be hard.\n\nGood luck; I know you love your kids and want the best for them.", "NTA. He has fallen in with a narcissist. classic isolate to control.", "Heartbreaking! NTA, OP. His gf must really be a character to disect and render a judgment about something she knows nothing about; it's concerning and hopefully you will be able to get past this at some point. No one is capable of hurting us more than our children. Perhaps you could start preparing a file, of sorts, for your son with all of the information, reports and legal documents from his pre adoption life and the time you took him home. He may not be receptive now but you can get ready for questions at some point. Someone is telling him a story that he wants to believe but it will fall apart since it's a lie.

You can't tell her when that will be, it could be weeks, months, or even years, because that's how big those feelings can be. In the meantime she can still talk to you about her brother, but it's best if you all give him space to work through these feelings, so she won't be seeing him for a while.\n\nShe needs to know that if she goes through something similar then she'll still have you guys as her safe space. You're not going to chuck her out or return her to social services. You will still be her Mums, but sometimes space is needed for all parties.

I would like to suggest that if that's true it's probably easier for him to think that someone forced this than that his family didn't want him. He may also simply believe you're wrong. People are allowed to be wrong. My bigger point was that it sounds like your son is looking at his life through a lens he hadn't previously been aware of and he's working out what he thinks. If your goal is a close, respectful relationship with him, you two need to apologize to each other and you owe it to him to at least hear him out on his thoughts about adoption.", "I know it would hurt him, but he is hurt now, regardless.

These children had no control over the events that lead to their leaving their birth families and didn't ask for or consent to their adoptions. Why on Earth should they lead lives of eternal gratitude? I mean, hopefully parents get it more right than wrong and their kids respect them, but in no way are adopted people obligated to be especially thankful.

He knows how to think for himself and he\u2019s letting his emotions cloud his mind. Also, he is free to reach out to his family if he thinks they really wanted to be a part of his family. I recommend sending him a text or email re-explaining the circumstances of his adoption and how he came to be with you, including the harsh truth of them not wanting to take him in.

If he had he'd probably be like your son right now.", "Nah this is just what happens when same sex \u201ccouples\u201d are allowed to adopt", "She is using her p*$$y to confuse/amaze him and he is being influenced by her. She sounds like a conniver who wants him as a pawn. He must be a good kid and she wants to utilize him as much as possible so she is either subconsciously or purposely filling his head with ideas that will anger him and encourage him to alienate himself from the family.", "NTA maybe try writing him a letter or email so you can get all the information in without it turning into another screaming match? Don\u2019t try and blame anything on him, just try and explain logically why what he is thinking isn\u2019t right.", "Honestly, it sounds like the new girl friend is trying to separate him from his family. Isolate him. This is how cults recruit. Seriously. His behavior change seems to coincide with meeting her and she\u2019s been filling his head with nonsense. What do you know about her?", "NTA He is not going to hear or believe anything you say. Just stay in the background and be there to pick up the pieces.", "NTA,\nNope I remember reading another reddit post kinda like this a few years ago. Where the kid got with someone and they put crap into their head about thier bio family and to forget their adopted one. As far as I remember when the kid did finally find his bio family they hurled abusive and manipulative crap his way then they tried to sue him for getting into contact with them. He finally came back to his adoptive family embarrassed and hurt. I hope your son leaves that girl and gets his head out of his ass because if what you said is true about his bio family. Then all he is gonna be is hurt and rejected.", "NTA. I can\u2019t imagine behaving like this with my parents (also adopted). I\u2019m so sorry. Sounds like the gf is exerting influence over him, but he is old enough to resist/get rid of her.", "NTA, his gf is influencing him with her ignorant takes, could be many reasons for it, but hopefully she isn't turning him against his family so that she can isolate him and manipulate and control him.", "NTA and from my math Sam is 12.... that means she was in foster care for a reason and if adoption was on the table then parental rights were terminated (state or choice) or disappeared at time of death for parents.\n\nlike reaching out to folks whose rights are terminated can be very dangerous in some cases. you never know why a child is removed and not all children can safely reunite with their biological family.\n\nand sometimes adoption is traumatizing, but in this situation it doesn't sound like whatever his gf is trying to sell.", "Gf is a homophobe and is putting toxic ideas in his head. NTA.  He needs to apologize for how he treated his mom before he is allowed home.", "How bizarre! Maybe the gf is threatened by the relationship he has with y\u2019all and is alienating him. I\u2019m so sorry!", "You're NTA - however I personally would approach with this as much understanding towards your son as you can manage whilst still protecting your daughter. 20 is a very normal age to rehash childhood trauma and try to work through it. This can result in lashing out. His gf is also enabling this. There is an anti adoption movement on tiktok atm. She has clearly gotten involved in that and is getting him involved too. \n\nHe is acting out of hurt and pain, and he can't take it out on his biological parents so I feel that you got the brunt of it. I would reach out personally and show him you still care. You can do this whilst still acknowledging that what he did was wrong, but I would avoid an ultimatum. Now is the time to show that you're not going to abandon him like his bio parents did, even though he is processing some tough emotions. \n\nIf you could subtly suggest therapy and if you think he would be receptive of this it would greatly help. 20 was around the age that I verbally lashed out at my mum about unprocessed childhood trauma. I'm 30 now and we're very close. It comes from him being in pain, not him trying to hurt you.", "Nta", "Ok. So his parents died and you adopted him and raised him as your own and his extended family never stepped up to the plate and somehow you are bad people for doing it? NTA. You were right to ask him to leave until he wants to apologize. I only worry his girlfriend may try to manipulate him and isolate him more, but there's not a lot you can do about it, except to let him know you're there for him.", "genuine question. is kicking the son out at the height of the incident an AH move? or is it only a AH move if OP doubles down and digs their heels in on their apology requirement?\n\ni ask because I wasn't sure based on your response if this was a very much the choices you make going forward will decide if your an AH.\n\ni just want to make sure i understand because i'm not part of the adoption \"triad\" as they sometimes call it. and thus, what do i know.", "Has he recently downloaded tiktok? There is quite a large community on there of people who have been adopted and were traumatized in their adoptive families. They argue that adoption is morally reprehensible no matter the circumstances and it's quite possible your son found himself in this echo chamber.", "If they cared about him they would have been in his life. They chose not to be. If anyone deserves his wrath and if anyone caused him trauma it was them. Not the people who took him in, loved him, and raised him. The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb. I don\u2019t think adoption trauma makes it a logical and understandable choice to suddenly hate his real family because some girl decided he was \u201cstolen\u201d from his bio family when in truth they chose to abandon him and he decided to choose her and the people who never cared about him at all over the people who were actually there for him.", "Isn\u2019t the whole gay people kidnap babies when they adopt them a whole talking point of the conservatives in America?", "His bio parents are dead. I guess he could visit their Graves but that's about it.", "All of this. Thanks u/nannyoggsknickers for summing it up so well. \n\nI hope Jack does come around. And in the meantime, keeping a supportive environment with open arms for both kids will hopefully show Sam how deep OP and Abby\u2019s parental love for both of them, bio relation be damned.\n\nNTA.", "Dude it's the truth. His parents fucking died and his family said, \"nah, you're on your own kid.\" They may not even be open to contact with him.", "\"You know nothing about adoption trauma\" still applies her. Yes, someone with unprocessed complex trauma is not always going to come to logical conclusions. We scientifically know this based on the understanding of what trauma does to the brain.", "re: your first paragraph, I think someone could quite easily reason their way there depending on how the adoption was initially portrayed. If they tried to portray it as selfless using the reason \u201cwe wanted to give you a better life\u201d, for example, the response \u201cyou could have done that by helping my bio family financially and then I wouldn\u2019t have the additional trauma of being taken from them even though they wanted me\u201d is completely reasonable.", "The new GF is putting all sorts of toxic thoughts into him. Hopefully, at some point he\u2019ll wake up.", "As a native person becoming a parent soon, I am absolutely shit scared my kids will do something perfectly normal and be taken away from me.\n\nShit, in my own ancestry, some kids stole a flag off a flagpole and the fkn whitefellas starting slaughtering the whole town demanding the kids be murdered for treason against the US \ud83d\ude44 I'm so scared they'll steal, like, a candy bar, and it'll be so hard to get my kids back.\n\nIts why I went to uni and got a desk job. In the hopes I can have some sort of economic leverage to not lose my kids in the future.", "yeah I guarantee you that his gf put ideas in his head inspired by Tweektok Liberals United. no one does a 180\u00b0 flip without external influences let's saty.\n\nvery valid anti adoption concerns btw, that should be addressed and rectified, reform the entire process. worldwide. I have seen some of those posts and well. i wouldn't trust any social media platform to base my beliefs off but i have made that mistake when i was 18-19 so. i am confident this is what's happening here. i don't think homophobia (at least not intentional, malicious) is a factor but who knows.", "yeah I guarantee you that his gf put ideas in his head inspired by Tweektok Liberals United. no one does a 180\u00b0 flip without external influences let's saty.\n\nvery valid anti adoption concerns btw, that should be addressed and rectified, reform the entire process. worldwide.

Just wanted to point out that if everyone adopted before they procreated there would be far more emotionally well equipped parents and no orphanages.", "Yes", "Talking is backing him into a corner to deal with something he isn't ready for and allowing him to destroy the relationship completely, maybe while hurting a child in the process.\n\nNot speaking with him until he decides for himself to treat others with respect gives him space to process his feelings without a punching bag so he cannot destroy the family relationship completely.\n\nDo you honestly think that you can get someone yelling crude insults to speak rationally about a heated topic? OP can't exactly send him to his room or explain it like he's 5. He's an adult, with adult relationships. Sometimes that means having to deal with the consequences of your actions. \n\nAnd OP has clearly stated that all he needs to do is stop hurting others and apologize. Do you really think so lowly of this man that this is an insurmountable hurtle? Elementary schoolers understand it- you hurt someone, they don't want to be around you until you make it right.", "Unfortunately you are still responsible for what you've said and done under the auspices of a toxic group or trauma, so Jack is the asshole. It would be the same if he started abusing substances, joined a toxic religious group, or let fame go to his head: don't hurt others.", "I'll pray for you. I know a few native families who did everything right and still got their children taken away immediately. The one in particular got used a lot to push for community fostering, which is proving to be a successful movement.\n\n(this happened in Canada, Alberta specifically. BC adopted the community fostering idea though)", "That's deeply fucked up and I'm sorry that is a legitimate fear for you.", "I'd be shit scared, too, but I know that I can't even imagine the half of it.\n\nIt sounds like you have planned most of your life to bring your children into the world so they are safe and protected and you made sure you had the education and the kind of job that does give leverage.  You have those kids so much already!  I'm so glad you will soon meet your first.  \n\nI wish you and all your children in the future the grace and strength to thrive.", "Not a guarantee", "No. That's an opinion made without knowing enough about adoption reality.\n\nFor one, orphanages aren't really a thing in the US. And abroad, most kids in the orphanages are not strictly orphans, despite corrupt orphanage owners selling them as such. Hell, that's true in the US as well, most kids in the foster care system have living family. Sure, we can debate the exact point of reunification and when that goal needs to be changed, but most \"orphan\" children have family attachments it's hurtful to remove them from completely. Basically, there's a lot fewer adoptable children than you think, especially in the US, to the point that a deficit in adoptable orphans was referenced with overturning Roe. \n\nSecondly, orphaned and foster children are not practice pancakes. If someone is not ready to have children, giving them a child with higher support needs isn't going to make the situation better. Adopting doesn't make someone a \"more emotionally well equipped parent\", and there's plenty of shitty adoptive and foster parents to prove it. It's also not reasonable to expect that everyone adopt to parent as a moral pejorative, because that does not suit all parents. Why force children to be the emotional support orphan? \n\nSo what does the foster and adoption system in the US need: well, it's complicated, because it's a big honking set of systems. More money would probably be a good start, so that recruitment and retaining of social workers is possible. More foster parents, definitely (everyone who feels called in that direction, consider it a sign, foster homes are BADLY needed). Likely a review of enforcement of current laws and how they affect minorities. Honestly a good number of laws need wiped entirely- in some states parents have to pay for their kids time in state care or lose custody, a clear penalty on being poor used to acquire kids for adoption. It goes on forever and will likely always be a work in progress, but hopefully outcomes for foster kids can be improved soon.\n\nTl;dr: if American history has taught us anything, it's that adoption is **NOT** a solution to... pretty much anything, and systemic adoption mostly causes problems.", "She\u2019s so right he would have been much better off in the system carry his belongings from place to place in a garbage bag.", "You think dr Phil helps people don\u2019t you? OP communicated clearly to an Internet forum not their son.", ">Immediately I cut in and told him to leave and not come back unless its to apologize.\n\nPretty clearly communicated. If he has any other concerns, they can wait until he has a clear enough head not to hurt others. \n\nSeriously, can you actually think of one thing that OP could have said to make the situation better? Or do you just expect her to accept being verbally abused because doing otherwise might make Jack feel bad?", "You just quoted op cutting off communication and no one easy statement isn\u2019t going to fix it. That is the point", "You really don't understand human relationships, do you? That's an appropriate response to cruel attacks on someone you love from someone else you love: you stop them from saying more and refuse to engage further until they stop attacking and apologize.\n\nBut, sure, OP could have just kept letting her son call her wife a lying bitch and... talked better? Magically made him reasonable? Kay."]}
