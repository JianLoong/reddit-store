We adopted our son \"Jack\" when he was a toddler after his parents had died. He is now 20. \n\nBringing him up wasn't without its difficulties but in all he was a good kid. Good grades, good judgement, didn't cause trouble on purpose. He always loved spending time with us, watching tv with us, and in his teen years he even began cooking with us and became somewhat of a Gordan Ramsey. \n\nI noticed things changed a bit after we adopted our daughter at the age of 7 \"Sam\" (he was 15) - she was a troubled kid, bounced around a lot in the foster care system. For a while he loved her and really enjoyed being around her and showing her that this house was safe, which was basically all the things my wife and I were trying to do. I want it to be clear that we never asked him to be a parent, that was our job. He always offered to do things with her and would often choose to be around her rather than his friends. He never had to babysit her, but he did on occasion during small emergencies. He seemed slightly annoyed with her, but always told us that it was just a bit frustrating to deal with her sometimes.\n\nFor info, when I say Sam was troubled, I mean she'd hide food, hide herself, and shut down a lot. There was no violence or anger. We still deal with the echoes of some of this today. We do have her in therapy to this day, and she's much better.\n\nSoon after his 19th birthday he met a girl (18 at the time) and his personality began to change. He grew resentful of us, of Sam. He'd make these weird or hostile comments toward Abby or me, and occasionally I'd catch him telling Sam about her bio family. I'd always try to shut it down, but he'd make some excuse and go home when I tried to talk to him. I don't want Sam getting into contact with her family - it's a toxic family that was no good and very dangerous for her. \n\nEarlier today me and the wife were speaking to him about his behavior, and he said that his gf told us that we 'kept him from his family' on purpose during his entire upbringing, and that adoption was a traumatizing experience that tore families apart. This stunned us, since we were always as transparent as we could be - what remained of his family didn't want to talk to him and that's why we adopted him. My wife tried to explain that we never tried to do that, he called her a lying bitch and to shut up, and that we're 'babysnatchers'. Immediately I cut in and told him to leave and not come back unless its to apologize. \n\nHe left, saying that he hoped one day Sam wisened up to us lying about her family as well. That we were awful for ripping a girl away from her real family.\n\nI don't understand his logic but he was clearly upset at us for what we did. I wish I hadn't kicked him out so we could have talked it through but he was just throwing verbal abuse at the woman who cared for him most of his life and I couldn't watch it. \n\nReddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679769576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121uyut/aita_for_kicking_my_son_out_for_how_he_treated/", "score": 1145, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you've been saying and doing all the right things where both kids are concerned.  Also, by age 20, he should have much better control over his actions and words.  He had no right to talk to you like this.  Hell, by the age of 6 I knew better than to talk to my parents this way.\n\nI don't think you should backtrack at all on the ultimatum.  If he gets in touch, you can be relieved or happy, etc, but stay firm on your rule.  He still has to apologize and it has to be heartfelt.  No throwaway stuff like \"alright, alright, I'm sorry\".  He needs to know WHY he's sorry and the apology should reflect this.\n\nAlso, something else might be going on with him.  Not an excuse but maybe an explanation.", "NTA!\n\nYour son's girlfriend certainly is though! I wonder where she got her \"information\"? A tiktok video maybe? Hopefully he comes to his senses soon. Meanwhile I would keep him away from Sam. She's had enough trauma in her life. She does not need him adding to is feeding her toxic BS", "NTA", "NTA. You're right about this being the girlfriend\u2019s influence, since he\u2019s brought her up during his statements. Hopefully, he\u2019ll see through her soon, and things can return to normal. She sounds toxic. Your wife will most likely get an apology once gf is out of the picture. Please be patient with him, and let him know that although you don\u2019t agree with what he said, you still love him.", "NTA\n\nYour priority right now is to protect your daughter. Jack is double threat to her - first, he pushes her towards a toxic family, and secondly - he ruins a stable, safe home she so desperately needs. In this situation he's the agressor, she's the victim. He needs to take responsibility for his behavior because I doubt he would feel responsible if Sam was hurt as a result of his actions", "NTA, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Is there an extended family member your son trusts that can talk to your son?  Would he agree to family counseling?  \n\nI'm guessing his girlfriend is an expert at exploiting his insecurities, which lends toward sychopathic tendencies. While not wanting to diagnose her, I can't think of another way to describe this level of manipulation. It seems that the girlfriend is enjoying the turmoil she has created. \n\nIt may be best to maintain firm boundaries but refuse any drama. Hopefully, she will get bored with your son when you don't feed her drama jones.", "NTA, but I think you made a mistake. Your son seems to have gone down a bit of a rabbit hole ... I know the whole \"adoption tears families apart\" issue has gained some traction in recent years. I'm not in a place to speak about what may be actual instances of this, but this certainly was not the case in your adopting your son. \n\nIt's almost as if your son has gotten into the Q theory of adoption. What he said to his mother and you was vile. Was your response perfect? I don't know. But I'm not sure you're doing your relationship any favors with the \"and don't come back until\" line. I don't know how to handle people like your son, who seem to have gotten sucked into a conspiracy theory. Best of luck in dealing with this situation: you sound like very decent people.", "I am going to go with a soft NAH here. You seem to be trying to do what's best for your kids here, but it's absolutely true that adoption, even in to a loving, stable family, is traumatic. It just doesn't happen when everyone's having a good day. It's also true that you adopted your kids. You committed to being their parents and it's incredibly fucking normal for people reaching young adulthood to be pretty angry for a while about how things were for them growing up. \n\nThere's a lot of resources out there from adult adoptees and birth parents that might help you and your family get to a better place. Shutting it down and assuming that you did your best, end of story, isn't how you solve serious family conflicts. Your kids didn't ask to be adopted. They're the only people in this entire situation who had absolutely no control over what happened to them or where they lived. The rejection your son must feel has got to be terrible. It was very uncool to tell your son that his birth family didn't want him. Even if they didn't, that's still a huge loss, not justification for your choices. He might need you to love him through this anger and look at your past in a different way.\n\nEdit: I do want to apologize if I misread something, OP. It sounded like you told your son that his birth family don't speak with him as you were having an argument. Reading it back, that might not be what happened. Hopefully you can all heal from this. Best of luck.", "INFO : Were his parents from a different cultural background? I've heard of people having adoption discourse on Twitter and Tumblr, but it was always in context of uprooting the child, not just adopting an orphan, and especially not removing a child from abusive home. NTA anyway, but that would at least explain where it came from.", "NTA\nWhile adoption can be traumatising and very problematic, it is not necessarily so. Seems like your son didn't have issues with this before his gf put a flea into his ear.", "NTA. But your son will have to find out the truth (that he wasn't wanted) or deal with that one way or another. Sounds to me his girlfriend is against adoption. That is pretty awful.", "ESH\n\nDisclaimer: I'm adopted. \n\nAdopted kids have some complex feelings that can be difficult to articulate, much less do anything about. It is not unusual to think about the family you \"should have\" had, to feel like you lost out on something everyone else got to have. Something normal and basic and expected: your biological parents. \n\nYour son is most likely *grieving* for the family he didn't have.\n\nIt's not a rational thing. His biological parents are dead. You didn't \"take\" them. But he still has grief. His extended biological family didn't want him, either. That hurts.\n\nAs an adopted kid, I didn't even realize how much grief I was carrying until the day I tracked down my biological father and learned that *he* had never wanted to give me up. Yes, he was such an awful person that the courts took me away from him and denied his paternity and all, but *I hadn't been unwanted.* I was loved. \n\nThat was like having this weight taken from my shoulders that I had no idea I was carrying.\n\nYour son will never get that experience, obviously. But he has other family that didn't or couldn't take him in. And he has a little sister who obviously went through a lot of trauma and does have a biological family out there that--honestly I don't know--might love her despite being awful people.\n\nFor the record, I love my adoptive family with all my heart. They gave me everything. I have never resented them. But everyone processes their emotions differently and these things are complicated.\n\nYou guys need to have a *real* conversation with your kid. Not an angry stormy blow up with name calling and house kicking. I get that your kid was and is being an AH and you were very hurt and defending yourselves. \n\nBut now is the time to reach out and begin repairing the breach. Offer to be honest and talk about everything, so long as everyone is polite. Recognize that your son has some nasty feelings right now without blaming him or his GF (she's a toxic busybody AH but she's his TBBAH so he won't see that for now.) \n\nIt may be easier to do all of this and keep the nasty emotions from running rampant by doing this in writing. I think being very thorough and clearing the air about the circumstances surrounding his and his sister's adoption could go a long way toward helping him heal.\n\nYour son is also dealing with the totally normal process of becoming an adult and learning to negotiate the parent-child relationship as an adult, which can also be hard.\n\nGood luck; I know you love your kids and want the best for them.", "NTA. He has fallen in with a narcissist. classic isolate to control.", "Heartbreaking! NTA, OP. His gf must really be a character to disect and render a judgment about something she knows nothing about; it's concerning and hopefully you will be able to get past this at some point. No one is capable of hurting us more than our children. Perhaps you could start preparing a file, of sorts, for your son with all of the information, reports and legal documents from his pre adoption life and the time you took him home. He may not be receptive now but you can get ready for questions at some point. Someone is telling him a story that he wants to believe but it will fall apart since it's a lie.

You can't tell her when that will be, it could be weeks, months, or even years, because that's how big those feelings can be. In the meantime she can still talk to you about her brother, but it's best if you all give him space to work through these feelings, so she won't be seeing him for a while.\n\nShe needs to know that if she goes through something similar then she'll still have you guys as her safe space. You're not going to chuck her out or return her to social services. You will still be her Mums, but sometimes space is needed for all parties.

I would like to suggest that if that's true it's probably easier for him to think that someone forced this than that his family didn't want him. He may also simply believe you're wrong. People are allowed to be wrong. My bigger point was that it sounds like your son is looking at his life through a lens he hadn't previously been aware of and he's working out what he thinks. If your goal is a close, respectful relationship with him, you two need to apologize to each other and you owe it to him to at least hear him out on his thoughts about adoption.", "I know it would hurt him, but he is hurt now, regardless.

These children had no control over the events that lead to their leaving their birth families and didn't ask for or consent to their adoptions. Why on Earth should they lead lives of eternal gratitude? I mean, hopefully parents get it more right than wrong and their kids respect them, but in no way are adopted people obligated to be especially thankful.

He knows how to think for himself and he\u2019s letting his emotions cloud his mind. Also, he is free to reach out to his family if he thinks they really wanted to be a part of his family. I recommend sending him a text or email re-explaining the circumstances of his adoption and how he came to be with you, including the harsh truth of them not wanting to take him in.

And abroad, most kids in the orphanages are not strictly orphans, despite corrupt orphanage owners selling them as such. Hell, that's true in the US as well, most kids in the foster care system have living family. Sure, we can debate the exact point of reunification and when that goal needs to be changed, but most \"orphan\" children have family attachments it's hurtful to remove them from completely. Basically, there's a lot fewer adoptable children than you think, especially in the US, to the point that a deficit in adoptable orphans was referenced with overturning Roe. \n\nSecondly, orphaned and foster children are not practice pancakes. If someone is not ready to have children, giving them a child with higher support needs isn't going to make the situation better. Adopting doesn't make someone a \"more emotionally well equipped parent\", and there's plenty of shitty adoptive and foster parents to prove it. It's also not reasonable to expect that everyone adopt to parent as a moral pejorative, because that does not suit all parents. Why force children to be the emotional support orphan? \n\nSo what does the foster and adoption system in the US need: well, it's complicated, because it's a big honking set of systems. More money would probably be a good start, so that recruitment and retaining of social workers is possible. More foster parents, definitely (everyone who feels called in that direction, consider it a sign, foster homes are BADLY needed). Likely a review of enforcement of current laws and how they affect minorities. Honestly a good number of laws need wiped entirely- in some states parents have to pay for their kids time in state care or lose custody, a clear penalty on being poor used to acquire kids for adoption.

Due to a few things that pop out to me in this story.\n 1) I only say so as a person with Autism and his reactions sound similar to mine so this comes from a place of high empathy: Your son sounds like he's neurodivergent in some way and might need higher support than he lets on but isn't necessarily letting onto it in easy ways (he also might have some expections that he wants you to rise to and feels failed at that too), so he may think he's communicating but feels like he's getting rejected the more he sees Sam's needs met or the more you don't have time for hum.\n\n Which brings me to my next part\n \n 2) He's likely relied on you most of his life and when he feels like you've been rejecting him; He finds another person to fill that loneliness, except she's got her own nasty issues and now wants to keep the full control this guy is giving her.

Bio family cut contact roughly 10-ish years ago. The child knows that, and that the choice to cut ties was bio family's. But they also know there is always a way to meet bio family again, in future, if the child determines they'd like to establish contact, and the adoptive parents are on board (as in adoptive parents have always been receptive to keeping that option open, as they believe it's not up to them - the adoptive parents - to decide what relationships the child and bio family have in future, only provide a safe and loving space.)\n\nUnless I've heard very incorrect information, \"stealing\" children from bio families so they can be placed for adoption isn't that prevalent, if it happens at all, and that would potentially be international adoptions rather than domestic.

I, obviously, chose the former.

I still had questions. And, as it turned out, a hereditary, potentially life shortening medical condition that I couldn\u2019t get diagnosed until I found my biological mother through DNA search. For years, doctors gaslit me and ignored my symptoms, because I had no medical history. My adoptive mom is lovely but had no idea how to advocate for me\u2014when they told her I was making it up because teenage girls are dramatic, she sort of gave up. I\u2019m not an anomaly\u2014many, many adoptees go without treatment for mental and physical ailments that would be easily explained and perhaps treated if they had that biological connection. That just scratches the surface of valid adoption trauma.\n\nYour desire to keep your kids \u201csafe\u201d from their biological families might be genuine\u2014but it is also beneficial to you. It sets you up as the only family that matters. It\u2019s a narrative society loves, the chosen family. But it\u2019s often harmful to the child, who longs for answers and grieves a connection, and they feel they can\u2019t tell you about their grief because they\u2019re supposed to be nothing but grateful to you. You might not frame it that way, but society does. It might not be your fault, but in this case, it seems it is your problem.\n\nAdopted children can simultaneously love their adoptive families and deeply, painfully grieve the biological connection. Ultimately if you want the most real and authentic bond with the son you want to think of as yours, you need to stop expecting him to love you and honor you solely for who you wanted to be for him, and start working on being his biggest supporter as he seeks connections that aren\u2019t you. If you build that bond and it\u2019s genuine and based on love and support, not an expectation of gratitude or pretending that you\u2019re his only family, then that bond will be there. If you can\u2019t see past your hurt feelings that he might grieve for a biological connection, then that bond will naturally weaken. It sounds like a lot of damaging things have been said and done on both sides. But you are the one whose responsibility it is to start the repair. You were the one who chose to adopt, and he is the one who started out with no choices. Therapy, openness, and trust might help lots.\n\nI genuinely wish you both good luck. (And I hope you apply this to your daughter too, whose story is going to be even more complicated and painful, and whose support needs may be even greater.)", "NTA. The biggest reason he changed is his girlfriend. She's a big homophobe and is brainwashing him. Doesn't mean your son is not at fault. He's 20. He should've known the repercussions to his actions.

And if he still doesn't listen, well you can do anything else then", "I\u2019m going with ESH, which I know might be unpopular. You don\u2019t seem to recognize that adoption is traumatic, regardless of whether or not children have a good experience with it - it\u2019s recognized by the medical community as such. It sounds like your son may be having big feelings about his own adoption, and is projecting and having concerns about you keeping your other child away from her bio family (whether you keeping them away is valid or not, you should be aware it is very common for adoptive parents to keep kids away from bio family under the guise of \u201csafety\u201d). I\u2019m not saying this excuses his behavior, just maybe contextualizes it. I would highly recommend you find an adoption trauma informed therapist to help you navigate this issue. I\u2019d also recommend you put the kibosh on blaming the girlfriend for his change in behavior, as well. That\u2019s won\u2019t do you any favors in trying to repair relationships.", "I am in UK and my parents are Foster carers, who usually look after the kids until they are adopted. 90% of the kids they get come from very dangerous homes where they have been badly abused... there is a Facebook group where several of those kids pictures have been plastered all over it with some bull**** story about how they had the perfect family who just hit on bad times and the kids were ripped away from them and they want help to find them again... the amount of people who support the stories and have actually given out info as to where they have seen the kids and stuff is amazing.... kids have had to be passed from Foster to Foster just to keep them safe :( \n\nIt sounds like girlfriend is one of these type of followers who believes all adoptions are part of some big conspiracy theory.

Good luck trying to salvage it.", "NTA", "The girlfriend is what's going on with him. Whatever her motives, she's doing this on purpose. NTA", "This whole comment is great, except for the fact that it doesn't mention that Sam should apologize, being in trouble or in pain is no excuse for hurting people, especially people who love him so much.", "That was my thought too. He wasn't intentionally being TA because he was just trying to protect the woman he loved but by doing it in the wrong way he inadvertently proved his son right in his head. I hope things get better for all of them. Sounds like the girlfriend is really toxic", "First, Jackfruit, I am so sorry you and your wife had this painful experience with your son. You both sound like really loving, conscientious parents who have worked hard to create a loving home for your children. You sound like big hearted people who want to meet the needs of children with complex pasts. I commend you and can feel your pain at this recent change in your son and your horrible last encounter with him. Strife in the family is so hard. \n\nSecond, it sounds like you very much want to continue a relationship with your son and repair what's happened. In my humble opinion, I don't think that ultimatums will get you there. They may feel good in the moment, but I think they feed a feeling of righteous anger inside us, primarily. They are closed doors that try to force a power dynamic, not tools that create healthy boundaries or encourage ongoing communication. This is just my take on it based on what I've learned from my experience. So, if ultimatums aren't maybe the best tack, what is one to do? \n\nThird, I might suggest suspending a right/wrong, blame-fault/wronged mentality here for a bit, so you can see the situation with less charged emotions and from multiple perspectives. So you can be _curious_ about what is going on here, instead of looking to assign blame, etc. I try to do this myself, easier said than done sometimes, but have found it helpful. In low/no judgement state of mind, ask yourself how things might look and feel to your son? Just from reading your post, I wonder if this might be the first time that he's allowed himself to really think about the family that 'didn't want him'. That is heavy and painful stuff, even with all the love he clearly got from you and your wife. This is often a deep, complex wound for a lot of adopted kids, it gets at the core of one's sense of self-worth and self-esteem. It's tough, complicated stuff, and few of us handle grace at the first word go. 20 is still quite young, and in the prime period where we grow into our adult selves. This usually involves so much re-thinking and reckoning of our childhood- at least it did for me and many other ppl I know.  I wonder if some of that might be happening here? \n\nYou mention that this changed with his gf and suppose that this new mindset/behaviour might be her doing, but maybe get curious as to whether he sought someone out with whom he could talk about this, when it started bubbling up for him, as in she is the sign that this was happening under the surface already, not that she necessarily instigated it all.  \n\nIf any of what I'm theorising holds any water, then I wonder if his lashing out to you is the way he's making sense of and dealing with the big emotions he might be feeling coming to terms with his adoption story, not having a relationship with any bio family, and them not being interested in him (whether he knows it in a conscious or unconscious level). He might be feeling anger, shame, embarrassed, and worthless while coming to terms with feeling/having been abandoned-  first, by patents who died, and then by bio family who didn't take him. His route to your loving home was bc of abandonment. Heavy stuff to process and his mind might be doing it for the first real time, now.\n\nYou and your wife are safe- you have spent many years showing him love, care, safety and forgiveness. I think this might be commonly known, but for better or worse, we often lash out at those who love us bc it's 'safe', in that there is a track record of forgiveness and space holding. It can be scary to feel angry, it can feel safer to act out and process your anger with ppl you know love you and will stick around after the aftermath. He might be feeling a lot of anger at his bio family right now- but they've already 'proven' that they will not stick around so it might not feel safe for him to fully feel or acknowledge his anger towards them. It might also feel safer for him to think that YOU were the one that kept him from his bio family, instead of the painful reality of them not being interested in him. \n\nAnd, again suspending judgement, is there some truth to you and your wife having made decisions to keep your son and daughter at a distance from their bio families? (Again, emphasise no judgement here,  it sounds like your intentions are based in protection for your daughter.) If this is at all true, regardless of good intentions, then perhaps your son's accusations also can make a little more sense- if he/your daughter were kept from their bio families he may be hurting from that, even if he knows on some levels you did it with the intention of protecting him/your daughter. Perhaps maybe bc that was a decision you got to make, but he/she didn't, and it all underlines how complex and heavy their full family situations are. There's nothing wrong with both ppl 'being right' in an argument, in my opinion this is the way things often go and should - seemingly contradictory things can often be true at the same time. Maybe its all true at the same time that you did things to keep him/sam distanced from their bio families, that their families have abandoned them in certain ways, that your decisions protected them from some harms, and that bio family distance can be painful regardless of the distance.  I find this helpful to think about bc imo, good relationships are rarely about determining who's right, and instead about being curious about other's perspectives and how to be kind in the midst of big emotions. \n\nAgain, I am so sorry you had such a terrible encounter with your son and he said such hurtful things to you and your wife. That must have felt like a punch to the gut. It sounds like your son was throwing out some of the pain he might be feeling at the safest targets- yay parenthood, amiright?? I don't think this is the end of the conversation, unless you make it so. \n\nI wonder what might happen if you were to reach out to him with curiosity about his accusations. Is there anything to learn from his perspective that would be useful going forward? I wonder what might happen if you were to reach out and say something like 'Jack, you're right, your mother and I have made some decisions in the past to put distance between you and your sister and your bio families. We were making these decisions with the intention of wanting to protect you both. But it sounds like your experience of our decisions and this distance caused you pain we didn't anticipate, which we're so sorry about. It sounds like we need to understand your perspective more here, bc I think they are things we can learn from how your feeling. We love you very much and hope that you know how much we miss you and value your unique views on things. Take the time you need, but know we're always here.'\n\nShowing serious acknowledgment of and loving curiousity about a someone's experience can bring down defensive and angry walls in a conversation. And you wanting to understand his perspective that he's angry he/his sister are kept from their bio families does not mean what you did up till now, was bad parenting- I suggest it just means that there are different ways to interpret and experience decisions made within a family. \n\nIt sounds like he needs you now more than ever, even if it's just knowing that you're there, continuing to love him, wanting to understand him, and that you're not going to abandon him. Keeping an open door to a room without judgement, might also make him feel and realise an apology for how he behaved towards you, I suggest staying ready to forgive him.  \n\nBest wishes to you all :)", "\n>I do want to talk to him\n\nYou think that can happen anytime soon?", "I have had some success with in this area as an ex-JW talking to people who haven\u2019t woken up yet.\n\nOpen ended questions and no accusations worked for me.", "Would e s h not be better then if Jack also did something unacceptable..?", "If there isn't a severing of legal ties it leaves the child and parents open to constant legal attack. This will strongly effect the security of the adoptive relationship and likely prevent real bonding.\n\nHalf the point of severing those ties is so the question mark goes away.\n\nAllowing adopted children access to their own records at the age of majority, etc is a perfectly fine adaptation to a modern world", "Thanks for the Info! The son seems to feel hurt on his and his sisters behalf and like the situation was not handled properly. It seems that the son has adopted the view of being a victim of a shitty system and sees his adoptive parents as evil helpers of said system. Maybe the fact he does not know much about his bio family makes him believe that informations are withheld in pupose. If he really is in contact with his or his sisters bio family there is a good chance that they made him believe they are innocent victims, too, and that his mothers enabled it. OP could reach out to their son and invite him to have an honest talk about what the situation was and is, what he would have wanted them to handle differently, what his expectations are in meeting bis bio family, in which aspect the situation was maybe handled different today, how they could assist him in reconnecting to his bio family, if possible, and so on. But maybe better get someone involved who knows about abortion trauma and helps them to sort things out, to deal with everybodies feelings and to discuss further moves and the possible outcome as there is the possibility that a lot of hurtful things will be said. This hopefully will help him get out of feeling deprived of something and being angry about everything. If he does not want his moms involved for the time being, though, OP and their wife need to wait patiently till he maybe realises one day that the people who gave him love and stability are quite good to have in his live. Having offered to help him they can be sure that he knows he can reach out to them any time, which might be easier to bear than knowing he left in a fight. OP, I wish all of you a lot of strength and that you manage to sort things out!\n\nEdited for clarity.", "That\u2019s all true, but the adopted person shouldn\u2019t be expected to be grateful. Also, the information that their birth family wants nothing to do with them may be so unacceptable that they react by lashing out at their caregivers instead.", "I think that's the nicest thing anyone has ever said to me. \ud83e\udd7a", "The question of leaving them open to legal attack is contingent on everything else in the legal system regarding adoption remaining the same - which is explicitly not the point.

Lashing out is fine for a 6 year old but this is a (young) adult- he can't control his emotions but he can control what comes out of his mouth. Theres a huge leap between \"grateful\" and calling someone who took in a kid with no other options a baby stealing homewrecker or whatever", "If there is always a lingering question of whether or not the child can be legally removed from the home, then no one will feel comfortable fully opening their emotions. The \"what if\" will loom like the sword of Damocles over the relationship. This will breed a dysfunctional and insecure familial relationship.\n\nOverhauling that part of the legal system would entail so much more than just the adoption aspect. Our system requires that there is a final \"with prejudice\" ruling at some point. Otherwise there is always a way to attack through legal means. You are basically saying to change our entire legal system in this hypothetical. Which, may be admirable, is largely impractical if not totally improbable.\n\nTo add: I am focused solely on the severing of legal ties. Not the other aspect which I have less concern about and seem possibly wise", "Yeah, obviously that\u2019s not okay, but it\u2019s also obvious that he\u2019s having a hard time understanding his adoption right now.", "Does it really? Do you not consider the US to be a developed country? Or do you consider adoption to be a form of charity? I ask because I've never heard of a country where it is the norm for the government to just pay the balance of your expenses because you have a child, without the parent having some kind of underlying disability.", "That IS exactly the crux of it. In this case the adoptee has an unreasonable expectation that their adoptive parent would care about them before the adoption. They should realize that money is earned, and her adoptive parents put in the work, bio parents didn't, and it's so insulting and hurtful to say all their hard work should just go to strangers. The bio parents weren't forced to give up their child; if they were susceptible to pressure, that's on them, not on the adoptive parents. It's easier to say \"I was pressured into giving up my child\" instead of just admitting \"I was not financially equipped to have a child, and couldn't bear the crushing poverty that I would have inevitably gone through had I kept my child.\" \n\nI get why the adoptee might be angry they were taken from their birth parents because of money, but their anger in this case is misplaced. Blame the bio parents, blame society, capitalism, or whoever else, but the one party that doesn't deserve blame from the adoptee is the adoptive parents.", "I think you are perhaps fundamentally misunderstanding the scope of what abolishment of adoption *could* look like, because what are you describing involves the birth parents having parental rights over the child in question, but most abolitionists **don\u2019t** imagine this. \n\nWhat is usually imagined:\n\n* Adoptees are not issues new birth certificates, but rather adoption certificates\n\n* Longer windows on adoption reversal (some states have **no** window)\n\n* Adoptees can retain legal rights to their birth parents in the event of their parents\u2019 deaths (this one comes from Karlos Dillard, who paid for his mother\u2019s funeral and death services but no longer had any legal relationship with her, which was a legal barrier to accomplishing taking care of her)\n\n* Adoption can be reversed by adoptees upon adulthood (This one comes from Karlos Dillard again, who not only had his parents\u2019 rights terminated for poverty, but was adopted out to an abuser who turned him out onto the streets and kept collecting money from the state. As an adult he was unable to have his birth parents adopt him back before his mother had passed.) \n\n* Many adoptees and birth parents would like to make open adoptions enforceable in court except if the birth family members (individually) are a danger to the child. This is beneficial for the child because it prevents the identity crisis many adopted people go through (same reason why they should always know they\u2019re adopted!) and let\u2019s them grow up understanding what their birth family\u2019s relationship to them is and how it coexists with their adopted family. Not to mention the benefits of genetic mirroring, having access to accurate medical history, and no accidental incest. This is, again, not the same as birth parents being able to come back and get custody."]}
