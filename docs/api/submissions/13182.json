We adopted our son \"Jack\" when he was a toddler after his parents had died. He is now 20. \n\nBringing him up wasn't without its difficulties but in all he was a good kid. Good grades, good judgement, didn't cause trouble on purpose. He always loved spending time with us, watching tv with us, and in his teen years he even began cooking with us and became somewhat of a Gordan Ramsey. \n\nI noticed things changed a bit after we adopted our daughter at the age of 7 \"Sam\" (he was 15) - she was a troubled kid, bounced around a lot in the foster care system. For a while he loved her and really enjoyed being around her and showing her that this house was safe, which was basically all the things my wife and I were trying to do. I want it to be clear that we never asked him to be a parent, that was our job. He always offered to do things with her and would often choose to be around her rather than his friends. He never had to babysit her, but he did on occasion during small emergencies. He seemed slightly annoyed with her, but always told us that it was just a bit frustrating to deal with her sometimes.\n\nFor info, when I say Sam was troubled, I mean she'd hide food, hide herself, and shut down a lot. There was no violence or anger. We still deal with the echoes of some of this today. We do have her in therapy to this day, and she's much better.\n\nSoon after his 19th birthday he met a girl (18 at the time) and his personality began to change. He grew resentful of us, of Sam. He'd make these weird or hostile comments toward Abby or me, and occasionally I'd catch him telling Sam about her bio family. I'd always try to shut it down, but he'd make some excuse and go home when I tried to talk to him. I don't want Sam getting into contact with her family - it's a toxic family that was no good and very dangerous for her. \n\nEarlier today me and the wife were speaking to him about his behavior, and he said that his gf told us that we 'kept him from his family' on purpose during his entire upbringing, and that adoption was a traumatizing experience that tore families apart. This stunned us, since we were always as transparent as we could be - what remained of his family didn't want to talk to him and that's why we adopted him. My wife tried to explain that we never tried to do that, he called her a lying bitch and to shut up, and that we're 'babysnatchers'. Immediately I cut in and told him to leave and not come back unless its to apologize. \n\nHe left, saying that he hoped one day Sam wisened up to us lying about her family as well. That we were awful for ripping a girl away from her real family.\n\nI don't understand his logic but he was clearly upset at us for what we did. I wish I hadn't kicked him out so we could have talked it through but he was just throwing verbal abuse at the woman who cared for him most of his life and I couldn't watch it. \n\nReddit, AITA?", "created_utc": 1679769576, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/121uyut/aita_for_kicking_my_son_out_for_how_he_treated/", "score": 222, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It sounds like you've been saying and doing all the right things where both kids are concerned.  Also, by age 20, he should have much better control over his actions and words.  He had no right to talk to you like this.  Hell, by the age of 6 I knew better than to talk to my parents this way.\n\nI don't think you should backtrack at all on the ultimatum.  If he gets in touch, you can be relieved or happy, etc, but stay firm on your rule.  He still has to apologize and it has to be heartfelt.  No throwaway stuff like \"alright, alright, I'm sorry\".  He needs to know WHY he's sorry and the apology should reflect this.\n\nAlso, something else might be going on with him.  Not an excuse but maybe an explanation.", "NTA!\n\nYour son's girlfriend certainly is though! I wonder where she got her \"information\"? A tiktok video maybe? Hopefully he comes to his senses soon.

You're right about this being the girlfriend\u2019s influence, since he\u2019s brought her up during his statements. Hopefully, he\u2019ll see through her soon, and things can return to normal. She sounds toxic. Your wife will most likely get an apology once gf is out of the picture. Please be patient with him, and let him know that although you don\u2019t agree with what he said, you still love him.", "NTA\n\nYour priority right now is to protect your daughter. Jack is double threat to her - first, he pushes her towards a toxic family, and secondly - he ruins a stable, safe home she so desperately needs. In this situation he's the agressor, she's the victim. He needs to take responsibility for his behavior because I doubt he would feel responsible if Sam was hurt as a result of his actions", "NTA, and I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Is there an extended family member your son trusts that can talk to your son?  Would he agree to family counseling?  \n\nI'm guessing his girlfriend is an expert at exploiting his insecurities, which lends toward sychopathic tendencies. While not wanting to diagnose her, I can't think of another way to describe this level of manipulation. It seems that the girlfriend is enjoying the turmoil she has created. \n\nIt may be best to maintain firm boundaries but refuse any drama. Hopefully, she will get bored with your son when you don't feed her drama jones.", "NTA, but I think you made a mistake. Your son seems to have gone down a bit of a rabbit hole ... I know the whole \"adoption tears families apart\" issue has gained some traction in recent years. I'm not in a place to speak about what may be actual instances of this, but this certainly was not the case in your adopting your son. \n\nIt's almost as if your son has gotten into the Q theory of adoption. What he said to his mother and you was vile. Was your response perfect? I don't know. But I'm not sure you're doing your relationship any favors with the \"and don't come back until\" line. I don't know how to handle people like your son, who seem to have gotten sucked into a conspiracy theory. Best of luck in dealing with this situation: you sound like very decent people.", "I am going to go with a soft NAH here. You seem to be trying to do what's best for your kids here, but it's absolutely true that adoption, even in to a loving, stable family, is traumatic. It just doesn't happen when everyone's having a good day. It's also true that you adopted your kids. You committed to being their parents and it's incredibly fucking normal for people reaching young adulthood to be pretty angry for a while about how things were for them growing up. \n\nThere's a lot of resources out there from adult adoptees and birth parents that might help you and your family get to a better place. Shutting it down and assuming that you did your best, end of story, isn't how you solve serious family conflicts. Your kids didn't ask to be adopted. They're the only people in this entire situation who had absolutely no control over what happened to them or where they lived. The rejection your son must feel has got to be terrible. It was very uncool to tell your son that his birth family didn't want him. Even if they didn't, that's still a huge loss, not justification for your choices. He might need you to love him through this anger and look at your past in a different way.\n\nEdit: I do want to apologize if I misread something, OP. It sounded like you told your son that his birth family don't speak with him as you were having an argument. Reading it back, that might not be what happened. Hopefully you can all heal from this. Best of luck.", "INFO : Were his parents from a different cultural background? I've heard of people having adoption discourse on Twitter and Tumblr, but it was always in context of uprooting the child, not just adopting an orphan, and especially not removing a child from abusive home. NTA anyway, but that would at least explain where it came from.", "NTA\nWhile adoption can be traumatising and very problematic, it is not necessarily so. Seems like your son didn't have issues with this before his gf put a flea into his ear.", "NTA. But your son will have to find out the truth (that he wasn't wanted) or deal with that one way or another. Sounds to me his girlfriend is against adoption. That is pretty awful.", "ESH\n\nDisclaimer: I'm adopted. \n\nAdopted kids have some complex feelings that can be difficult to articulate, much less do anything about. It is not unusual to think about the family you \"should have\" had, to feel like you lost out on something everyone else got to have. Something normal and basic and expected: your biological parents. \n\nYour son is most likely *grieving* for the family he didn't have.\n\nIt's not a rational thing. His biological parents are dead. You didn't \"take\" them. But he still has grief. His extended biological family didn't want him, either. That hurts.\n\nAs an adopted kid, I didn't even realize how much grief I was carrying until the day I tracked down my biological father and learned that *he* had never wanted to give me up. Yes, he was such an awful person that the courts took me away from him and denied his paternity and all, but *I hadn't been unwanted.* I was loved. \n\nThat was like having this weight taken from my shoulders that I had no idea I was carrying.\n\nYour son will never get that experience, obviously. But he has other family that didn't or couldn't take him in. And he has a little sister who obviously went through a lot of trauma and does have a biological family out there that--honestly I don't know--might love her despite being awful people.\n\nFor the record, I love my adoptive family with all my heart. They gave me everything. I have never resented them. But everyone processes their emotions differently and these things are complicated.\n\nYou guys need to have a *real* conversation with your kid. Not an angry stormy blow up with name calling and house kicking. I get that your kid was and is being an AH and you were very hurt and defending yourselves. \n\nBut now is the time to reach out and begin repairing the breach. Offer to be honest and talk about everything, so long as everyone is polite. Recognize that your son has some nasty feelings right now without blaming him or his GF (she's a toxic busybody AH but she's his TBBAH so he won't see that for now.) \n\nIt may be easier to do all of this and keep the nasty emotions from running rampant by doing this in writing. I think being very thorough and clearing the air about the circumstances surrounding his and his sister's adoption could go a long way toward helping him heal.\n\nYour son is also dealing with the totally normal process of becoming an adult and learning to negotiate the parent-child relationship as an adult, which can also be hard.\n\nGood luck; I know you love your kids and want the best for them.", "NTA. He has fallen in with a narcissist. classic isolate to control.", "Heartbreaking! NTA, OP. His gf must really be a character to disect and render a judgment about something she knows nothing about; it's concerning and hopefully you will be able to get past this at some point. No one is capable of hurting us more than our children. Perhaps you could start preparing a file, of sorts, for your son with all of the information, reports and legal documents from his pre adoption life and the time you took him home. He may not be receptive now but you can get ready for questions at some point. Someone is telling him a story that he wants to believe but it will fall apart since it's a lie.

You can't tell her when that will be, it could be weeks, months, or even years, because that's how big those feelings can be. In the meantime she can still talk to you about her brother, but it's best if you all give him space to work through these feelings, so she won't be seeing him for a while.\n\nShe needs to know that if she goes through something similar then she'll still have you guys as her safe space. You're not going to chuck her out or return her to social services. You will still be her Mums, but sometimes space is needed for all parties.

I would like to suggest that if that's true it's probably easier for him to think that someone forced this than that his family didn't want him. He may also simply believe you're wrong. People are allowed to be wrong. My bigger point was that it sounds like your son is looking at his life through a lens he hadn't previously been aware of and he's working out what he thinks. If your goal is a close, respectful relationship with him, you two need to apologize to each other and you owe it to him to at least hear him out on his thoughts about adoption.", "I know it would hurt him, but he is hurt now, regardless.

These children had no control over the events that lead to their leaving their birth families and didn't ask for or consent to their adoptions. Why on Earth should they lead lives of eternal gratitude? I mean, hopefully parents get it more right than wrong and their kids respect them, but in no way are adopted people obligated to be especially thankful.

He knows how to think for himself and he\u2019s letting his emotions cloud his mind. Also, he is free to reach out to his family if he thinks they really wanted to be a part of his family. I recommend sending him a text or email re-explaining the circumstances of his adoption and how he came to be with you, including the harsh truth of them not wanting to take him in.

You handled it correctly, you know...like a parent.", "NTA. It\u2019s really weird his girlfriend who is a complete and utter outsider with no actual idea of what the dynamics were really like between you and your wife, your son, and his remaining biological \u201cfamily\u201d claims that you \u201ckept him from his family\u201d and \u201ctore him apart from his real family\u201d without knowing anything about these people who didn\u2019t even care enough about him to either take him in or try to have a relationship with him once his parents died. And why would your son take her word for it? He has no reason to believe her when she doesn\u2019t know any real information about what went down? Is he stupid or just incredibly naive and gullible? Either way, him trying to convince Sam to go back to her bio family who clearly is not fit to care for her by the trauma she has obviously endured is actually a real danger to her, and he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to try to give her these stupid and dangerous ideas. Being genetically related to someone does not mean they love you, will take care of you, and are automatically good people to have in your life. It just means you share a little DNA. That\u2019s it. Anyone who automatically believes genetics supersedes love is a na\u00efve hopeless fool with no idea of anything that goes on in the world and has no real concept of what a family actually is. If he wants to throw your family away out of a moronic loyalty to strangers who never cared about him on the word of a girl he\u2019s known for about a year who he has absolutely no reason to believe over you, that\u2019s his choice. He will live to regret it eventually. But that doesn\u2019t mean he gets to risk re-traumatizing Sam, and honestly I think she should be the priority right now. I wouldn\u2019t let him into the house or let him be around her unless he proves to you he can be trusted and has gotten over whatever ridiculous fit of insanity he is going through.", "NTA - Let him get in touch with his bio family. Fully enable it. Let him find out for himself how much they missed him.", "NTA -  Give him his family\u2019s info and let him make the decision. If his family want him, they will step up.", "And the son to for buying her bullshit.", "Definitely TikTok", "Literally this but so well-phrased and without the anger in mine. (Haha, still dealing with my own trauma apparently).\n\nI DID feel resentful for a long time but now I'm so damn grateful and loved. Thank God mom never kicked me out when I was awful.", ">your kid is lashing out and you responded by taking over control and kicking him out \n\nOmfg the Reddit psychologists are so fucking infuriating. I\u2019m honestly embarrassed to admit that this random internet comment pissed me off this much.\n\nOP raised the kid for quite literally his ENTIRE life, took care of him when the people who fucking brought him into this world didn\u2019t want him and WAS PERFECTLY fine until all of a sudden he meets a girl and immediately takes her bullshit over OP and his wife\u2026 then he proceeds to call his mother a bitch and try to deceive the daughter into thinking that she\u2019s been \u201cstolen\u201d from her abusive bio-family. \n\nLashing out is stealing a beer behind your parents backs, lashing out is being passive aggressive. This bullshit is not lashing out. What this kid is doing is called being a bad human being.\n\n>Tell him no name-calling \n\nOh yes what a deep and insightful solution to this predicament. \u201cTell him no name-calling\u201d that will definitely solve all of their problems. Bro cmon \ud83d\ude2d are you being serious right now.", "I don\u2019t think you or other adoptees get a say in this scenario, cause not all y\u2019all are the same. Commenters who aren\u2019t adoptees have better insight anyways without all the emotion lol", "No. What a terrible thing to say. Nobody deserves that. What's wrong with you?", "It definitely sounds like he's gone down some type of extremist rabbit hole, this is really heartbreaking. Has he shown other signs of some kind of religious or political indoctrination?", "This is an awful take. You know how you push people towards bad people? By telling them only the bad shit so it seems like it's obvious bias.\nSam is 12. Unless you think he's going to kidnap her and drop her off at a biological parents, she's not \"unsafe\". She's just being told something you don't want her to hear. She needs to hear it. The good AND the bad.  Otherwise, you'll end up with another Jack.", "Damn wow. Telling him no one in his family wants him and you call him the enemy ? You must absolutely hate this kid now. That\u2019s some of the meanest things I\u2019ve ever heard.  You absolutely killed that relationship forever", "He is not \u201cthe enemy,\u201d he is processing his adoption (obvs not in a healthy way).", "Jesus. So yeah. You don't say \"your family didn't WANT you\". You say \"your parents died and that's why you're not with THEM.\" If he asks about why no one else in their family took them in \"I'm not sure. Maybe they weren't close enough or thought you'd be better off with us. We don't know for sure. \" and then HE can find out when he's 18 and reaches out to them. Ffs.", "AITA posts about adoption always brings out some insane takes -_-", "There's also a general anti-adoption movement. Some of their complaints are valid- for example, there's well-documented instances of coercion of bio mothers and removing Native children specifically for adoption purposes- but can get ridiculous and extreme with its messaging. \n\nAdoption is a much more complex topic than many people feel comfortable admitting. At the same time, OP and her family were not doing anything wrong and it sounds like he's a case where the system worked well.", "Yea, she\u2019s 1000% intentionally turning him against them", "His girlfriend is a homophobe hun sorry but sometimes they follow a trend that's probably being influenced by your typical thinking with sec in the picture. I do not think your son actually believes what he is saying deep down. Just young people love and lust blinders on. NTA he is also one for not thinking things through. I had a much more blunt way of putting it but do not want to get in trouble."]}
