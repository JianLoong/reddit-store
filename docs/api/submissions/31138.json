Due to some financial insecurities we used to face we moved back with my parents for a little while until we were able to afford to rent an apartment. I've lived with my parents in the past of course, then moved out with my fianc\u00e9e for 2 years. Now we've moved with my parents for a while until the house we want to rent is available which will be in 2 months. \n\nFor context I have a married older sister who's in the brink of divorce with her husband because he's doing nothing around the house. He simply comes back from work and sits and plays until he goes to bed while my sister does all of the housework on top of her full time nursing job. My mom believes my sister is unreasonable for her demands towards her husband and believes it's a woman's job to do housework and cater to her husband even if she works a job. Also when I lived with my fianc\u00e9e alone she'd always bad mouth my fianc\u00e9e for \"forcing me\" to help around the house and always said how as a woman she's not taking proper care of me, her soon to be husband because I also cooked, cleaned, did chores etc. Even now that we live in my parents house, when we need to do laundry etc I don't expect my fianc\u00e9e to be the one to do it. I do it myself many times as well. My mom doesn't like that and claims how my fianc\u00e9e has me as a maid.\n\nNow despite all that, my mom demands that I help her around the house when it's housework she wants to do. And I do, I always do my part since I live here but for her it's never enough and I'm a lazy son who doesn't care about helping his mother. After all the ridiculous stuff she's said about my fianc\u00e9e and my sister's \"traditional roles\" I told her than you know what? I'm not helping around. That's a woman's job remember? So don't demand from me to help you with your chores since it's a woman's job and I'm a man. Ofc I keep defending my sister and I keep contributing equally to my fianc\u00e9e and I's chores. I just refuse to contribute any helping hands to my mother since she believes she's entitled to help but my fianc\u00e9e and sister are supposed to be maids. \n\nMy mom has bad mouthed me to the entire family right now and whenever someone visits they scold me and call me an AH basically for being lazy and not helping out my mom.

The guy earns money, which usually means working outside the home, as an employee or business owner.  In return, the wife takes care of the house and kids.
