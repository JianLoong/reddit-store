Due to some financial insecurities we used to face we moved back with my parents for a little while until we were able to afford to rent an apartment. I've lived with my parents in the past of course, then moved out with my fianc\u00e9e for 2 years. Now we've moved with my parents for a while until the house we want to rent is available which will be in 2 months. \n\nFor context I have a married older sister who's in the brink of divorce with her husband because he's doing nothing around the house. He simply comes back from work and sits and plays until he goes to bed while my sister does all of the housework on top of her full time nursing job. My mom believes my sister is unreasonable for her demands towards her husband and believes it's a woman's job to do housework and cater to her husband even if she works a job. Also when I lived with my fianc\u00e9e alone she'd always bad mouth my fianc\u00e9e for \"forcing me\" to help around the house and always said how as a woman she's not taking proper care of me, her soon to be husband because I also cooked, cleaned, did chores etc. Even now that we live in my parents house, when we need to do laundry etc I don't expect my fianc\u00e9e to be the one to do it. I do it myself many times as well. My mom doesn't like that and claims how my fianc\u00e9e has me as a maid.\n\nNow despite all that, my mom demands that I help her around the house when it's housework she wants to do. And I do, I always do my part since I live here but for her it's never enough and I'm a lazy son who doesn't care about helping his mother. After all the ridiculous stuff she's said about my fianc\u00e9e and my sister's \"traditional roles\" I told her than you know what? I'm not helping around. That's a woman's job remember? So don't demand from me to help you with your chores since it's a woman's job and I'm a man. Ofc I keep defending my sister and I keep contributing equally to my fianc\u00e9e and I's chores. I just refuse to contribute any helping hands to my mother since she believes she's entitled to help but my fianc\u00e9e and sister are supposed to be maids. \n\nMy mom has bad mouthed me to the entire family right now and whenever someone visits they scold me and call me an AH basically for being lazy and not helping out my mom.

The guy earns money, which usually means working outside the home, as an employee or business owner.  In return, the wife takes care of the house and kids.  THAT  is why she preaches that housework is woman's work.  There are many who will argue that she's wrong, but it's her household.\n\nSO.  In her household.

It only gets worse if you try to take a lunch break and have a conversation (\"Oh, you have time to talk to your grandfather but you didn't have time to help me earlier?!\").", "I question your strategy there but your goal is noble. You played a reverse uno card and she can play one right back. But you are NTA.", "Well played, OP.  Tell the flying monkeys to get bent.\n\nNTA", "Just as an FYI this is no longer true, if there are multiple judgements it gets flagged for a mod to set the judgement.", "Only top comment matters.", "Uff, your mom sounds like a peach .... move out asap.", "Your mom gives me strong narc vibes.", "You wanna throw it back at her, refer to her housework as being unemployed. \n\n\"No, I'm working, not everyone gets to be unemployed like you\".", "Internalized misogyny is one hell of a drug.", "It doesn\u2019t but maybe she has offered to do a chore he hates doing in it\u2019s place.

Only his mom does", "Get a lock on your door and tell her that if she continues to disrupt your work hours with her selfish hypocrisy, you will be cutting her off from your life the minute you leave her house. \n\nWork towards not being there.

It might be worth it to avoid the aggravation from her.", "I would tell the whole story to everyone who scolds me. I would be very dramatic. \"My mother thinks my sister is a terrible wife for expecting her husband to help around the house and she told me it's a woman's job. She is saying the same about my fiancee. She says no man should help them. According to her, a man is supposed to do nothing while they slave away. And on top of those poor women slaving away as my mother wants, mij mother is being judgemental all the fucking time too. I decided I want do defend my wife and sister and throw my mother's words back at her. If you want to scold me, do whatever you want, but you are not my poor wife and sister that have to hear all this constantly from my mother. I rather support them than anyone else.\"", "Your mother has insecurities and damaged self-esteem. She needs to demean others to feel superior/good about herself. By shaming others, she feels that they are less than her & everyone should see how superior she is. She can't even see the depth of her hypocrisy or cruelness. \n\nYou can't fix her. You can, however, recognize how damaged & delusional she is. She's likely too invested in this delusion to be reasoned with. She needs a support group or professional help for her brokennes\n\nYou have 2 more months of living under her roof/her rules. Once you move out, start to limit contact, and if she talks about your spouse or someone else's,  either end conversation immediately or pretend you didn't hear her and change the topic. Do not allow her to have an audience for her behavior and and abuse. Shut her down immediately.", "You know that I (probably like most of us) started off assuming that you were going to be TA. But your response to your mom was absolutely... inspired.\n\nMy next concern was that your parents are doing you a favor and could be shooting yourself in the foot. But it sounds like you are upholding your end of your free stay responsibilities. You have really impressed me (a wife and mom).\n\nThe only suggestion I can offer is that when those other family come to visit and scold you, you can share your mom's position about your sister/gf with the family and ask you mom if she stands by those statements about your sister/gf. And then say, that if she doesn't stand by them, she needs to apologize to both women for saying those things and never ever say them again. Any reasonable family members will understand what's going on. The ones who don't are probably part of your mom's hypocritical sexist cult.\n\nGenius, NTA", "She is having difficulty grasping the work from home limitations.", "You should edit your post to include that she's expecting you to do chores while you're supposed to be doing your WFH job", "Wow.\nYou're a good man. Please keep your reasonable beliefs and raise your kids to be useful people (if you have kids). Nta", "She specifically said it doesn't matter if the woman has a job or not.
