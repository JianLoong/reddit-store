My aunt (61 F) lives in London (which is where my internship is) so I decided to spend some time with her. My cousin (aunt\u2019s daughter, 33 F) and her family live in the same apartment building as my aunt, so often when my cousin and her husband are working or traveling, my aunt is the one who takes cares of her granddaughter (1 yr old). \n\nMy cousin and her husband have been gone for a wedding for the past few days so the baby was at my aunt\u2019s house. Whenever my aunt was busy, I would help out by watching the baby and making sure she wasn\u2019t crying or fussy. She particularly likes it when I sing to her, so I would sing lullabies to calm her down. Unfortunately, the only lullabies I know are cultural ones (Indian) and are often about mythological, religious stories. I didn\u2019t think this was a big deal since my aunt still practices the religion and I\u2019ve seen Instagram photos of them and my niece dressing up for things like Diwali.\n\nHowever, after my cousin came back, I told her how my niece really likes these lullabies and joked that she would be a great musician. My cousin seemed upset and told me not to involve the baby in religious practices without her consent. She said that her husband doesn\u2019t appreciate his daughter being forced into a religion (he does not practice the same religion).\n\nI feel bad for overstepping my bounds, but I also don\u2019t think this is such a big deal. The songs aren\u2019t even in English and I don\u2019t think the baby understands the language since my aunt\u2019s family only speaks in English at home.

The baby didn't understand but now you know the parents don't want that so don't do it again. Simple as that. \ud83d\ude0a", "NAH\n\nYou didn\u2019t do anything wrong on purpose, and unless they were overly mean to you about it, then they were just expressing their views to you. \n\nIt there\u2019s going to be issues like this, it may be best not to babysit for them anymore. Not as punishment, it just seems like you guys don\u2019t click", "You can't religiously influence a one-year-old to begin with and especially when you are speaking a language they don't know!\n\nNTA", "NAH\n\nYou were just helping the way you know how to, you meant well, you did not set out to convert her 1yo to a specific religion. I also understand the concerns of the mother and although she might have overreacted a bit (who knows why) her concerns (probably) come from a good place she wants her daughter to make her own choices and I can\u2019t fault a parent for wanting that for their children. \nI think your offer to apologize is very mature of you, you didn\u2019t mean to hurt them, or overstep, you meant well, explain that and that you intend to respect their wishes in the next interactions with their daughter. I hope your cousin understands it, and if she doesn\u2019t well than that\u2019s on her.", "NAH. You weren't trying to convert the baby to your religion, and they had never asked you not to do so. Now that they've asked, you can choose different songs next time.", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know she felt that way, and it\u2019s not something you should\u2019ve anticipated. If you had known how she felt and still sang the songs, that would be one thing, but that\u2019s not what happened.", "At one year old, it's nothing more than music and voices. There's no indoctrination here. In fact, hearing other accents and languages can help a child form verbal skills later on, so it's actually good for the kid if you sing in a language that she doesn't hear all the time.\n\nNTA", "NTA They are not attacking you here - she\u2019s relaying how they wish to raise their daughter and her not appreciating religious indoctrination so you stop. Not to shame you or anything, it\u2019s about their daughter.", "NTA.\n\nI'm not religious but I still tap my foot to Amazing Grace if I hear it out in the wild. I mean, I get it, I wouldn't want anyone forcing my kid into religion either, but it's just a song. \n\nBetter make sure the baby knows medical doctors tend not to be concerned whether monkeys are or are not jumping on beds while you're at it.", "NTA. The father is perfectly in his rights to ask that his kid not hear religious music (even though I think in this case it\u2019s a silly request), but he should have made that clear from the beginning. He can\u2019t be mad that you crossed a line you didn\u2019t know was there.", "NTA - anyone complaining about free childcare and what songs you are singing to a child who isn't old enough to speak doesn't need free childcare.  stop taking care of her child.  she doesn't appreciate it.  and don't feel bad.  i'm a practicing and believing christian, i wouldn't have any problem with you singing indian lullabies to my baby.. or toddler... or kindergartener...  frankly, that type of love and care you can't pay for in child care.", " NTA: I agree with you OP, This is not a big deal, you were singing lullabies. Your cousin is really sensitive about her husband's preferences. Sadly, your niece may miss out on some of her family's culture as a result.", "NTA\n\nAnd I say that as an ardent and vocal atheist.\n\nThe kid doesn't understand anything, at all, yet.\n\nMaybe, *maybe* the melodies will stick in some way that predisposes the kid to a religion, but I doubt that.\n\nI think your cousin is looking to be a victim, and that's just assholery. You were soothing a sleeping child. If you did that with benadryl, you'd be more of an asshole than you are for singing a religious lullaby, which is to say, not at all.", "NTA you didn't know that it was a point of contention and were trying to do something nice. That being said you would be the asshole if you continued singing those songs after being asked not to. Her being the mother of the child means you need to respect her boundaries but I get the sense you're doing that and just confused at the boundaries. Which is totally understandable so definitely NTA.", "NTA \n\nA one year old isn\u2019t practicing any faith and they aren\u2019t exposed to the language often enough for it to be a real issue.\n\nYour cousin likely just wants to set boundaries now.", "NTA- You didn't know. You stopped once told, so it's fine.", "NTA - OP, you can sing me lullabies! They sound lovely! It\u2019s not like you forced a child to get baptized or anything, and tbh, most English lullabies are super dark anyway - Down will come baby, etc. \n\nApologize that your cousin is upset, but you didn\u2019t do anything wrong.", "NTA. They are majorly overreacting. You can religiously influence a 1 year old. At that age it\u2019s just music to them, they can\u2019t fully understand the religious ties to the melodies.", "NTA You didn\u2019t know she\u2019d have a problem with it. As long as you don\u2019t do it in the future, it\u2019s fine. She\u2019s lucky that you were there to entertain her kid. FWIW, we\u2019re atheists, but my kids grew up hearing a few religious songs. Some just have sentimental value even if we don\u2019t believe the stories anymore.", "Your cousin\u2019s baby is also your cousin - not your niece. Your sister or brother\u2019s child would be your niece. Since the baby is just a baby, I don\u2019t think YTA (as long as you respect your cousin\u2019s wishes now that she knows).", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn\u2019t know. Your elder aunt didn\u2019t mention it either so you had no idea", "NTA \n\nI think Kid Rock is a jackass (his public image, on a personal level I don\u2019t know the dude) but when I was a teenager I figured out through trial and error that Only God knows knocks babies right out so I sang it to kids I babysat. So far none of them have grown up to be MAGA supporters.", "NAH. You were helping with the baby and singing songs she couldn\u2019t really understand anyway. Then when your cousin asked you not to do it anymore, you stopped. No one is an asshole here! You haven\u2019t ruined anything by singing songs for a couple of days and now you have a lot more information about how your cousin wants to parent her kids. \n\nDon\u2019t worry about this too much and go enjoy your internship. The history and conflicts between your cousin\u2019s religious mother and non religious husband are probably really complicated and they have nothing to do with you; you just got caught in the crossfire a little bit, but you didn\u2019t cause any irreparable harm here.", "I don't think you're an AH but you should stop especially since they've shared their wished with you.", "NTA at one they don't care, and honestly if those are the songs you know that's what you sing. My kid got Christmas songs in September because I had very little sleep and that's all I could remember the words to, so some times it is what it is .", "NTA, the kid is too young to have any real concept of what your signing to her. If the parents don't want you to sing them to her just don't sing to her anymore.", "It\u2019s not about this instance, it\u2019s about stopping it now before you continue to do these things in the future. Sure, now it\u2019s a lullaby in another language she can\u2019t understand. And then maybe it\u2019s in English, and then maybe you buy a Christian children book, and then\u2026 Just sing a normal lullaby next time. Lots of people are sensitive about religion, and many people have trauma that they don\u2019t wish to bring upon their kid.", "NTA You're not forcing anything. At her age, lullabies are, quite literally, soothing noise. I used to sing Christmas carols for my daughter. It wasn't Christmas and I'm not religious, but it's what I could drum up or if my exhausted brain.", "You had no idea.  Say sorry and just sing her some different songs and let this drop.  It doesn't have to be a big deal.\n\nNTA", "NTA definitely because at that stage, it\u2019s just music for the baby!\n\nHowever, since your cousin has strong feelings about you singing mythological lullabies to her baby - give her a simple apology and move on.\n\nSince you are moving out of your aunt\u2019s house anyway, it should be simple to avoid your cousin\u2019s baby for a while. If you ever visit your aunt in the future again, cross check with her so that you don\u2019t spend time with her when her granddaughter is around. Don\u2019t hesitate to inform your aunt about this if she probes.", "NTA. I don't think a lullaby in a different language is going to convince anyone to join a religion or form some kind of religious zeal in them- I don't think it's unfair to ask you not to involve the child in more religious activities, but it's a little ridiculous to think a lullaby is 'forcing' a 1 year old into a religion.", "I understand that. She doesn\u2019t think that I should be helping out with her daughter anymore, which is why I felt a bit bad. I\u2019m leaving my aunt\u2019s house anyway for my internship, so I would like to apologize before I go. I just didn\u2019t think it was such a big deal that she felt I was a bad influence.", "No the father is perfectly in his rights to ask that his kid does not hear religious music.", "In Indian culture, cousins are viewed like siblings. Hence, their children are viewed as niblings.", "Sorry, I am a bit unfamiliar with family relation terminology in English. Thank you for the clarification.", "Oh. I agree with you on that.
