Will they pursue kicking the neighbors out?  Or will they let it continue, and just threaten to slap the neighbors with increased cleaning fees when they move out someday?\n\nIf management doesn't make this actually stop, and if you continue to feel unsafe because of these neighbors (and your reasonable fears of retaliation), then your only option may be to get out of your lease and move.\n\n\\*If\\* the management tolerates them staying in the apt, despite the \"no smoking\" rule being on the lease, then I'd think you'd have a reasonable case for breaking your own lease.  You not only agreed to no smoking, you moved in with the expectation that it was a no-smoking building.  Whether you were allergic, asthmatic, or just hate the smell -- you moved into a place expecting not to have to deal with it.  But if management won't enforce the rule, then the \"rule\" doesn't do any good.\n\nBut, it would be a lot of work, and hassle, to move.

I have asthma, husband has migraines (smoke is a trigger) and I\u2019m livid. No real issue with the concept of partaking, but I did *not* consent to this exposure. \n\nOP, if your building is specifically non-smoking make sure to loop the landlords in ASAP: that smell will linger on the walls (as you know) and you don\u2019t want to be out a deposit because of your neighbors.
