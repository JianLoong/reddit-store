I drove him home and on the way it came up that he had been given a bag of a hard drug while he was out. I asked where it was and he first lied that he had gotten rid of it. He eventually admitted that it was in the trunk of my vehicle in his briefcase. We used to carpool often, but after this I told him that I was no longer comfortable doing so and that he would need to find another way to get to and from work. He understood, apologized and we have maintained a friendship in and out of work. \n\nSince this , he has relapsed multiple times. I've witnessed (and objected to) alcohol use and he has admitted more hard drug use. He did recently begin taking more action to get help than he has in the past, though he is only 3 months sober now. \n\nUp until this week, he has not asked me for another ride. Friday, his car died and he asked me for a ride to work. He told me that due to the cost of the repair, he would not be able to throw me any gas money. In a text, I explained that due to past events, I did not feel comfortable driving him to work. However, I would be willing and happy to pay for a rental car for the weekend. He declined the offer and told me that he doesn't like to define people by one event that happened two years ago. That night at work, I acted no different than I always do, but he was very standoffish, barely making eye contact with me. \n\nYesterday, he called to discuss the issue by phone. I have great respect for him and the fact that he initiated this communication. He said that if that is the way that I feel, he doesn't really understand but it's okay. He told me that it blindsided him and really hurt his feelings when I told him that I still felt uncomfortable driving him. He then went into a monologue regarding ways that he has helped me out in the past, some of them requiring a lot of time and effort on his part. I should have clarified, but it seems that he was trying to communicate that he still feels that he was owed a ride by me in return for other favors that he has done. He never thanked me, or even mentioned the fact that I had offered to pay for a rental car for him to use this entire weekend.\u00a0 Is this gaslighting? \n\nI feel that not driving him still is justified because a) the seriousness of the outcome had the substance been found in my vehicle and b) the small amount of time he's been sober.

He's not a friend of he's reminding you of his favors that he's done for you. You're right in saying you were willing to go above and beyond by offering to pay for a rental. If he is a true friend, he should respect that you're still uncomfortable about the consequences of him lying about bringing hard drugs into your property. Addicts have ways to gaslight people close to them. I hope you stand your ground!", "NTA. You'd be in legal trouble too if drugs were found in your car, and it's not that you're only holding onto the past incident, but that there's a real risk of a repeat offense.

Yeah probably. If it is, then I wouldn't be friends with the guy at all. No one needs someone that's going to get them arrested in their life. If telling him not to bring drugs into the car ever again isn't enough to stop him, stop being friends with him.\n\nIf it isn't warranted anymore and he would never betray your trust ever again, then YTA for punishing him for a mistake he has learned from and hasn't repeated.", "NTA. Not even a little bit. Your friend should honestly feel lucky that you still call them friend.", "NTA.  You can\u2019t afford to risk it.", "NTA. You don't owe him anything.", "NTA. He already put you at risk once. Also, he has relapsed a few times. You didn offer to help, but he rejected it.", "NTA but that isn\u2019t gaslighting, he\u2019s just berating you.\n\nI\u2019m curious why you describe him as a friend, though, when he\u2019s neither one of you is able to let this go and move forward.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nDon't let that AH enter your car or your home.

You make light of the impact those choices could\u2019ve had on people. You relapse often. You try to manipulate others into complying with your wants.

You still have a lot to work on.\u201d", "Yeah OP did more than necessary in offering a rental.\n\nIt's like accusing someone of a heinous crime then going well I didn't post it on social media or gossip to others LET'S MEET UP TOMORROW...like dude you said something terrible, didn't apologize and you just want to pretend nothing happened and you didn't just risk something bad happening if someone else overheard...?\n\nOP did the right thing going no effing way am I risking this relapsed drug addict forgetting drugs a 2nd time and getting me in trouble if I get pulled over giving him a ride personally."]}
