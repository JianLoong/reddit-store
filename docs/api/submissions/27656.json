Let me explain.\r  \n\r  \nMy boyfriend and I are in a 5 years-relationship, and we've lived together for 3 years. We always talked about our future together we are planning to get married in around 2 years. So I brought the subject of... The engagement ring.\r  \n\r  \nIt's pretty common in my family that it was something the couple both looked for and buy together, so I wanted to talk about it. First, my boyfriend told me he didn't understand why an engagement ring was needed. I was a bit confused, because I assumed it was considered a traditionnal gift to have as a symbol of commmitment. I explained that it was important for me, that I wanted a real engagement proposal and that a ring would be a symbol of our engagement and love that I would cherish for the rest of my life.\r  \n\r  \nAt my response, my boyfriend understood and said that he will respect my wish but still didn't really see the point. He was always generous towards me, so his response has left me a bit surprised. I also specified that it would be nice if we also get him an engagement gift to mark the occasion, something of value for him. I suggested a watch or a new musical instrument, as he's a musician. He said \"why not, we'll see\".\r  \n\r  \nLater, I saw an acquaintance of us getting engaged and showing off her diamond ring on social networks. I showed the picture to my boyfriend, saying that I liked that kind of ring. But he didn't responded well, and said again that he didn't see the point about getting a ring. He then went online to do some research, and came to me saying that the diamond business was horrible, not ethical, and really pricey for what it's worth.\r  \n\r  \nI tried to compromise and talked about getting another kind of jewel like a sapphire or an emerald, and also looking for a second-hand ring. He said that would still count as not ethical and expensive for what it's worth, and then suggested getting a zircon instead, which I found a bit disappointing because to me it wouldn't last great.\r  \n\r  \nI thought about getting it on my own but it would sound fake to me, as my husband-to-be wouldn't be involved in the process. I feel like a spoiled brat who is asking for a lot.\r  \n\r  \nTo be honest, I do want something valuable to reflect our love/wedding/commitment. I don't want a big thing that cost a fortune either, just something classic. My boyfriend and I are both engineers, and we can afford it. I see others around us getting engaged and now I can't help myself but notice that the girl always get a ring, and no one seems to question that.\r  \n\r  \nBelieve me or not, but apart from that, my boyfriend and I don't have any issue that we didn't solve through talking and compromise. That's why I'm a bit lost here.\r  \n\r  \nSo, AITA ?", "created_utc": 1695718606, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16sienu/aita_for_wanting_an_engagement_ring/", "score": 38, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

We picked it out together. This isn't something I'd compromise on because YOU'RE wearing the ring and he doesn't like any of your solutions. He doesn't want to buy you a ring.", "NTA.\n\nIt's a shame that he makes you feel like a spoiled kid, and guilts you, for wanting what brides-to-be traditionally and reasonably want. It's a shame that he isn't willing to just give you, his bride-to-be, what you want, whether or not he \"sees the point\" of it.\n\nYou might want to explore what else \"he doesn't see the point of\" in wedding celebrations, as compared to what you might have in mind.", "NAH. You're not the asshole and I think buying a second-hand ring is a lovely idea. Wouldn't say it's unethical, as it's basically giving an item a second life, not creating new demand. Plus, that way you get something with history, maybe even one of a kind, which can really count as a special gift to mark the occassion.\n\n\nI do understand where he's coming from. Seems like he values practical presents more and those rings can be crazy expensive. I think you can find an acceptable solution though.", "I think this is a bit NAH, with your boyfriend being a bit wilfully obtuse. \n\nIt's common in pretty much every culture to mark an engagement with something of value. Often jewellery but historically its been a myriad of things. You're not an AH for wanting to participate in the process and to want what majority of people get when they get engaged. \n\nThat being said, your partner doesn't have to spend his money on something he's not comfortable with. I suspect he's using his ethics as a way to circumvent your wants, but there are a lot of lab grown gems that have grown popular which would be conflict free.\n\nIf you want a ring, I think you both need to be involved in the process and that may mean putting your money where your mouth is and participate financially. But I'd also be really clear with him that it seems very odd that he is dancing around this so much.", "NAH\n\nYou both have valid points. I think some of his are an excuse to be cheap but given how expensive things are these days I don't blame him. That money could go towards a house deposit.", "Lab created diamond are gorgeous and alot cheaper and even cooler.....done with machines. Which I think is amazing and makes it ethical", "NAT\n\nYou shouldn't be asking for it. He should already knew it as you both are preparing for wedding and committment for life. He should've expected everything especially the expenses, gifts, traditions, etc. \n\nI think he's still not prepared, and he has \"Be thankful for what you have right now\" mindset. You are willing to have a cheaper ring just for him to give it to you as a gift, but he's not giving any effort, and if he agreed to give you one is because you insisted/asked not because he is willing.", "NTA- What the heck planet is he from that he doesn\u2019t understand that an engagement ring comes with an engagement?\nIf he\u2019s a vegan environmentalist etc. then you would think you\u2019d have discussed his concerns about the diamond industry before he looked it up to support his excuse to be a cheapskate.\nMy thoughts - have you set a date? Is he going to worm out of the whole thing?\n- it\u2019s a weird hill for him to want to die on knowing it\u2019s important to you, does he steamroll you often?", "> I feel like a spoiled brat who is asking for a lot.\n\nYou aren't. You grew up in a culture where engagement is tied to gifting ring, rings are a visually appealing piece of jewellery for most people and then rings made out of high quality materials (metal, gemstones) can literally last for hundreds of years (so it's not like you're asking for one-time use item). It's okay to want to have ring, it's okay to want your loved one to propose with it.\n\nPart of me understands your boyfriend, as he is making some valid points. But what concerns me is that he isn't trying to compromise. There are ethical ways of getting high quality gemstones that look great (it was mentioned here before, the lab grown gems - diamonds) and there are cheaper alternatives (moissanite is among popular alternatives to diamonds). You yourself suggested some solutions too (other gems, second hand ring, exchanging gifts.\n\n>To be honest, I do want something valuable to reflect our love/wedding/commitment. \n\nFor a long time I was questioning if I want engagement if I'm going to wear a wedding ring anyway, but then I realized exactly what you've said - the engagement gift is not just a trinket on your finger to show off how rich you are, but a valuable piece that will remind you how much you've gone through together to get to the point where are you now. An engagement ring - regardless if it costs $600 or $6000 - represents all what's beautiful in love and most likely is going to be a piece that will stay with you for your entire life, together with the wedding ring.\n\nAll things considered, I find you NTA. I find your boyfriend TA because he has seriously many ways of reaching the compromise, you suggested them, he picked up only one (Zircon) which given the nature of engagement ring (meant to last for years) is going to get ruined pretty fast, effectively truly wasting money", " NTA, from a practical point of view it reduces hassle from other men (although some see it as a challenge). I cannot see why he is being so weird about it because even if it was down to just money, you don\u2019t have to spend very much at all - eg looking in a second hand jewellery shop.  This isn\u2019t actually about money, your boyfriend is acting strangely. I couldn\u2019t imagine my husband denying me anything that he thought would make me happy (within the bounds of our finances). Buy the woman a ring, it is not hard!  Tbh I would be trying to get to the bottom of why he was being so odd about it.  Certainly he ought to be sensitive enough to realise it was important to you, so he ought not to be belittling it.", "Sounds like a really weird hang up on his part... the nonethical thing sounds like a bit of a cop out if I'm being honest (what, he will also not buy a decent wedding ring because it's not \"ethical\"?). Have you asked him why he's so against it? Seeing it's something you would like and it would hold special value for you into the future? I hope he's not getting cold feet... anyway, NTA for me, hope it all works out!", "NTA,  if you want a real diamond, there are jewelers out that they have documentation on their diamonds that prove they are not \u201cblood diamonds\u201d.", "seeing all your answer, I will go to NTA because something seems fishy with your boyfriend, he doesn't want to compromise, pretends to not understand the importance of the rings and doesn't say what is his real problem with the ring. I hope I'm wrong bt reading that, I have a bad premonition", "NTA, and getting a used/vintage diamond is a good compromise.", "NTA and he needs to understand that a relationship is also about paying attention to what\u2019s important to your partner. This is important to you, he can put in some effort. I second the comments about lab grown diamonds.", "NTA. Buying preowned ring is a good way to save money while simultaneously getting a good quality ring", "NAH. You each have different ideas of what you want from marriage and both of your views are valid.", "The lab diamond is a good idea and I\u2019m sure there are other ethical weddings rings out there. \n\nBut let me ask you this, do you want a long term commitment or set on marriage.  I know there is a lot of pressure on getting married and I always thought it was weird when long term couples were married.  But then after being married almost 15 years and now divorced, I would only do it again for a couple reasons and to show or prove my love isn\u2019t one of them.  The day you get married you don\u2019t love him anymore than the day before and it doesn\u2019t prove anything.  \n\nBesides saving money on taxes, there aren\u2019t many benefits but there are a lot of costs.  We spent about $50k on the wedding and then about $40k each getting divorced and that took 2 years which were hell.  We probably would be better acquaintances (2 kids) had we not went through the divorce.", "I think saving money for trips, good experiences together and good house is more important than a big wedding or ring.\n\nIf this is his way of thinking, he should communicate better.\n\nBesides that, you never considered a simple and small gold ring (in your story) and never mentions both financial situation.\n\nYou are not in sync. The first thing when thinking about the future is the need to be in sync", "A lot of Jewellery companies are advertising lab grown diamonds (Pandora are advertising on tv every half hour it seems here in the UK). This should put paid to his argument about ethics at least. \n\nIf he then moves it on to something else, another excuse, then I really think you should talk it out and find out what the issue really is. Not seeing the point is not an answer, the point being it\u2019s what you want and will make you happy.", "NTA. Your boyfriend needs to stump up, stop making excuses, and buy a damn ring. A good one, that you want. He should do it properly or not do it at all.\n\nHe sounds obsessed with his own rationality and like he thinks he\u2019s above any kind of sentimental or symbolic meaning. He needs to realise that the engagement ring is not about him.", "YTA Its a way capitalism has used peer pressure and 'tradition' to get you to give rich people money, its nothing else.\n\nBuy your own ring. Why aren't you buying one and giving it to him? Why doesn't that symbolization need to happen?", ">apart from that, my boyfriend and I don't have any issue that we didn't solve through talking and compromise. \n\nYou don't have any other issues because this is the first time you've been unable to give up on something that has meaning for you and not him.   He's a good boyfriend as long as he doesn't have to make an effort to satisfy your feelings.   How is he about randomly doing something that he knows you like that has nothing to do with him.   Do you feel that your gifts are at a reciprocal level -- i.e. do you get things that shows he really knows you or are they \"duty\" gifts and do you ever get random acts kindness?\n\n\nYou explained that it was important to you and he said \"meh\".  You want more visible sentiment and he doesn't see the point.   That's not a trivial incompatibility.   Personally, I think you might want to line up some counseling sessions for yourself to get some clarity about what you need in a life partner because I don't think getting married to this guy will be satisfying for you.\n\n**NTA**", "Yta, I guess you need an expensive gift to show off to your friends which is incredibly lame. I\u2019m so happy my current wife didn\u2019t want an engagement ring because we both think they are a cringe worthy stupid thing that only materialistic people crave. I think people who desperately want them are embarrassing. I\u2019d be less embarrassed for you if you accepted a less expensive alternative.

There are loads of options here.\n\nFirstly, with natural diamonds, it can be smarter to go to a good jeweller and ask them to make you something within a budget. I say this because a lot of stores will sell you an expensive diamond saying 'this is great because of the colour and clarity' but in all honesty, these things aren't actually crazy important. So there are some diamonds that are not crazy expensive because they'll be 'slightly included' but if you can't see inclusions with the naked eye...who cares?

She's talking about getting a ring that's only $1-2k, which is already cheaper for fine jewelry. Most homeowner's and renter's insurance will insure a ring of that value without any significant hassle/without significant additional cost.\n\n>Does the only price and diamond make a value of the ring?\n\nLike the vast majority of things, you tend to get what you pay for. Extremely cheap rings don't tend to last with daily wear. There are some cheaper materials that can last, but if she doesn't like the look of those materials (for example, titanium rather than gold) - **it doesn't matter** because she needs to love the ring because **she needs to wear it every single day for the rest of her life.**\n\n>Maybe he is finding out the special way of telling her that he want to be with her for the rest of their life?\n\nWhere does her post in any way imply that he's doing anything special for her? It reads like he's a cheapskate who's arguing with her about a ring (a traditional, known custom) and then going and finding articles online to justify his not wanting to bother getting her a ring. The guy reads quite lazy and cheap - he didn't know or care about ethical jewelry prior to needing a reason to justify not getting her a ring, and is shooting down reasonable compromises like a second-hand ring or non-diamond stones.\n\nIt's frankly quite sad.", "$5k+ is crazy for me. I was looking for something around $1k-2k, which is still a lot I guess. And if I get something like that, I'll make sure he gets something of value too, like I said in my post.", "Yes, I must admit you're right about that. It depends on what we spend our money of course, but I'm more of a spender compared to him.\n\nAccording to what people around me experienced, I thought about a $20k budget for our wedding (with 120 guests in total). My boyfriend is saying more like $10k budget. But I don't know, we didn't look into details, so hopefully I'm wrong and we won't need to spend so much. I'm a newbie to this kind of business!", "They clearly need to task this out more, but I know multiple couples who got married without ever having engagement rings. They just didn't care.

They\u2019re rife with quality and customer service issues!", "I'm going to pop this here: the idea is that you have to wear this ring every single day for the rest of your life. It should be a quality, durable product that will last. It should also be a style/stone you love. Again - to emphasize - it should be these things because you're wearing it *every single day* for the rest of your life. \n\nThere are very few things in life that would be something of this nature. \n\n*None* of what you're asking for is unreasonable or spoiled. $1-2k is completely reasonable, actually for fine jewelry it's on the cheap side. Please stop letting him make you feel bad about yourself for wanting something that is extremely normal and expected. \n\nHe should be proposing to you with a quality ring because it is important to you and he cares. That's all the reason he should need. I find it so sad that more than likely, you are now going to be looking at whatever ring you get and remembering not fond memories of when you got engaged, but instead this uphill battle to get him to care about something that's important to you. As others have said, this time is a great barometer for you both as a couple...\n\nAnd while it's great you want to get him something of value too, please keep in mind that unless he's using that item every single day, the use (and thus quality bar) on these items will be different."]}
