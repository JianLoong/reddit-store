She is and will always be our only niece so naturally we all love her very much and we spoil her.\n\nThe problem is the same brother remarried recently and his wife has a 16yo son. This was unexpected considering even his daughter was an accident so none of us really expected him to marry a woman who has a child. \n\nThe issue is we all love spending all of our money to go to expensive vacations and any money that we have left gets spent on my niece. A few months ago was her birthday and the cheapest gift she received cost 400 dollars. As I said we all enjoy spoiling her.\n\nA few days ago was the stepson's birthday and we all bought nice gifts costing approximately 50 dollars each.\n\nMy SIL is mad because we bought more expensive gifts for my niece but I don't know what else she expects. The only way we could afford better gifts was by using our vacation money or by changing the way we treat our niece, none of which we are willing to do", "created_utc": 1694889855, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/16kessw/aita_for_not_changing_our_lives_for_my_brothers/", "score": 2806, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

SIL is confused about how a blended family works. Could you all treat her son the same as your niece? Yes, but you're not obligated to. You've all known your niece since she was born. She's been family as long as she remembers. Her son doesn't have that same connection with you all. The only reason she expects the same treatment is because she wants the stuff. She's doesn't care about what the stuff represents. \n\nYour step nephew, in theory, has extended family from his mom and his dad. That extended family is not you all. You can be friendly and cordial, but at 16, this bond is just not going to be the same as it is with your niece. If she can't accept that, she needs to talk with a counselor about the intricacies of blended families.", "ESH except the step kid and the niece.  As a step parent, I can\u2019t ever imagine doing what you guys do.  Also have welcomed many extended family step kids into the mix and I always treat them equally.  No, you aren\u2019t required to treat them equally, but it is the kind thing to do.  You all go way overboard for your niece to a ridiculous excess.  That\u2019s not healthy for her either.  There is no reason she needs gifts where the cheapest is $400.  Why don\u2019t you all agree to tone down the gift giving for her and do something decent with the excess you have been spending, such as start an account for her for education or for use when she turns 21 or maybe get them both experiences instead of stuff.", "Hmmm. Seven siblings and almost every single one was parentified? And almost every single one got a vasectomy and is child free? And all can afford vacations and lavish gifts? (Rolls eyes)", "Honestly if my siblings were dropping more than $2k on my kids every birthday I\u2019d be upset without the discrepancy between kids.", "Your niece has been the only child in your family for 14 years so it\u2019s natural to spoil her and your choice/right to do so.  As for too much spoiling being harmful to her\u2026well\u2026 if there weren\u2019t changes in the family situation, would that even be in question?  I mean, if it wasn\u2019t an issue before, it shouldn\u2019t be now.  Both kids are teenagers, not littles who maybe wouldn\u2019t understand.  It sounds to me you\u2019re being very generous to both kids, your SIL shouldn\u2019t be trying to dictate what you do with your money.  NTA", "Personally, I think you are going to create entitlement issues down the track by multiple people spendings hundreds of dollars each in a gift for the niece. Why does she need such expensive things at her age? What does her father think of this and the fact his stepson is getting gifts worth much less? Whilst you don\u2019t owe the stepson an expensive present, you are contributing to likely resentment issues in the blended family. NTA, but getting there.", "Wow, this is such an alien concept to me. I had aunts and uncles bring in steps and halves to the family, and in our family you got treated the same regardless of blood. Even when my aunt was dating a man with kids for a short time, not even married (my immediate family met them all of one time), we sent birthday cards with money/gifts for the boyfriend's kids the same as we would for our actual cousins. \n\nOne of my uncles married a woman who already had kids. They became our cousins, even the one who had her own dad. After the divorce, the evil witch of a mother told the kids that my grandparents and the rest of the family didn't love them anymore. One time the girl saw my grandparents at the park and called out \"grandpa!\" before her mum took her away. It was just so sad; my grandparents never stopped thinking of those kids as their own grandkids, regardless of the divorce or lack of biological ties. The kids lived just a few minutes' walk away, and would have been welcome in the house anytime. \n\nSo yeah... it's kind of an alien concept to me to not treat blended family who married in to your family, as... *family*. \n\nI know a lot of people here are saying you don't know this kid, don't have the bond with him, he has his own extended family, he'll be off to college in a few years etc etc. But his mum is your brother's wife; it doesn't look like they're going anywhere. Would it *really* hurt to make the split a little more equal when spending on gifts? This kind of favouritism is exactly how you get people who hate their stepfamilies, when one kid in the house gets treated significantly different to the other. Sure, you don't know this kid *yet*. But you have the option to make him feel *properly* like part of the family rather than a visitor you're simply being polite to, and it's just really sad imo that you don't seem to care. \n\nYTA.", "Soft YTA.  I get that you're not as connected to the new stepson because you've only known him for a few months.  That doesn't justify such a disparity in the value of the gifts.  This is likely to cause a division in their family as they try to blend.  Lower the value of the gifts (say $200 instead of $400) and set aside the rest in a graduation/college fund for her.  She'll still get nice gifts and have extra when she's going to be starting her adult life.", "NTA\n\nYou have only known this stepson a short period of time so why would you provide the same level of gifts as a niece who you have known all her life. \n\nAnd a gift of $50 is not cheap for someone who is essentially a stranger to the family.\n\nIn the future, perhaps don't make the expensive gifts as obvious and give them to her privately.", "Yes, you do spend a lot on your niece, but it is your money. Here's my sticking point; How does your brother's decision to marry a single mother suddenly put YOU under an obligation to buy her son, well, anything?\n\nThere are hundreds of tales on Reddit of step parents treating their blended families badly, and it's your brother's responsibility to avoid that. You, I'd suggest, not so much. It's nice you spend as much as you do on your new step-nephew but that's at your discretion, not his mother's.\n\nYou are expressing 14 years of affection to the only close relative of that generation. Why you have to match that for a teenager that has become a relative by marriage only recently, well I don't see it. In fact, if your niece found out her birthday pot was now being halved with her new step-brother then she would be entitled to be upset. \n\nNTA", "YTA. If you\u2019re spending so lavishly on the niece that anything more than a $50 gift for the stepson will make a serious dent in your vacation spending then you\u2019re spending too much and creating havoc on the new family dynamic.", "YTA.   Guess I'm in the minority here. Nothing divides a family faster than treating kids differently.  Your brother will back his wife and then you all will lose.   I suggest balancing the scales a bit", "ESH, by the sounds of it this is a marriage less than a year, but likely there's been involvement for longer. While it's fair to not be expected to go full equal spend so early, a little closer a split would be better than such a big disparity.\n\nI'd also say you're not necessarily doing your niece a favour by spoiling her so much. I can't think what a 14 year old would need that would be looking at a minimum of $2400 being spent on one birthday in gifts from aunts and uncles. A quarter of that would be a blowout birthday, better instead to put towards education savings etc for down the line.", "I can see a NAH here.\n\nI get where you are coming from - you\u2019ve known your niece her entire life and she will always be a part of your life. You don\u2019t have that type of attachment with the step-nephew.\n\nI also get a mom getting riled up that there\u2019s a really LARGE gap between how the two children in her household are treated by her husband\u2019s family - in the hundreds ( to a thousand) difference.\n\nThere shouldn\u2019t be the expectation by the mom, but it does communicate that the stepson isn\u2019t seen as much a part of your family and there\u2019s no expectation/want of a relationship.", "ETA except the kids. You aren\u2019t obligated to give anyone a gift, but don\u2019t be upset or surprised if you aren\u2019t allowed in her life the same way if you don\u2019t knock it off.", "I would advise your SIL not to worry about it, as if what you\u2019ve said here is true you\u2019re all already teetering on the edge of financial disaster and sooner or later you won\u2019t be able to get presents for anyone.", "Your SIL sounds like an entitled gold digger. No one owes anyone a gift and certainly not a gift of a particular monetary value. She needs to check the definition of \u201cgift.\u201d NTA.", "YMMV, but I think OP's family should seriously learn some financial literacy. I don't know how much they're making, but spending all/most of your money on vacations and expensive gifts is *not sustainable*, either for your finances, your niece, or the environment.", "I'm going with yes you're the ah. Not for the price of the gift you gave your niece versus the price of the gift for your step nephew, but for your whole demeanor in this post and then the answers you've provided to questions. You come across as looking down on your brother for marrying a woman with a child. And while the sister-in-law should not have gotten upset over the price of a gift, did you stop to think that maybe that's not the real reason she's upset? That maybe she feels unaccepted by you and your family? That she feels her son is not accepted by you and your family? Did you stop to ask yourself that?\nAs for everyone saying oh there's a whole another family there's a dad blah blah blah, how do you know? How do you know that the dad is in the in the picture how do you know the dad's family is in the picture? You don't, you're just assuming. Stop to think maybe the sister-in-law is wanting this to be the step nephew's family because he doesn't have another one?", "I think YTA.\n\nIt's probably not reasonable for your SIL to expect you to treat her son exactly like your niece. This is a little girl that you all knew since she was a baby, probably helped raise at least a little. There's a different kind of bond there, and that's totally OK.\n\nWhere y'all went left was the great disparity between what the niece and the step nephew get. Do the gifts have to be exactly equal? No, but it *does* make a kid feel shitty when they're unequal to this degree. She's getting new phones and laptops and $400 headphones or whatever and he's getting, a video game? Even that's more than $50.\n\nI'm going to be honest, I was on the fence about this one. Like I said, you have an established relationship with this child, and nobody should be expecting this equality. It's just that I kind of thought about this focus on the amounts - like, you all know how much you each spent on the niece *and* the step-nephew, as if you planned this in concert somehow. (Maybe I'm stretching, I don't know!) but it was mores when you said\n\n>The only way we could afford better gifts was by using our vacation money or by changing the way we treat our niece, none of which we are willing to do\n\nWhich, like, spending a little less on your vacation so you could make your new step-nephew feel welcomed into the family feels like a good choice?", "SOFT YTA. Put yourself in the boy shoes. It\u2019s hard for him to. He has new people in his life. Sure, he doesn\u2019t expect 100% the sale treatment but the disparity is too much here. Put that money into her college funds. Spoil her a little bit more,  like 20-30% more. The boy has his other family too to spoil him. They just can\u2019t spoil him like 5 childfree adult can. Plus, your niece can use the money later to buy a house or something. The more money you put in your funds, the more you increase her quality of life in the future. She will thank you more for this. A 16 yo doesn\u2019t need thousands dollar gift lmao. Do this for the sake of your family. Your brother has a new son now, he wants him happy as much as his daughter. You should want that too. \n\nRegarding the college funds, have a little conversation with your brother about it when you feel like it\u2019s the right moment. Because yes, you will be more mindful of your gifts but be careful of his wife intention regarding the college funds. It\u2019s for your niece and her only. Except if your niece is willing to share. Have that conversation now to make sure that your his wife knows that you won\u2019t be paying for their son. Not your pig not your farm, they can start thinking now about saving for him if it\u2019s not done yet haha", "Sounds divisive. I feel bad for the kid who knows that their \u201cfamily\u201d think less of them. You could get 375$ gifts and throw in an extra 25$ each and still have a nice gift for niecy. \n\nBut, you know, if you think this kid deserves less, i guess you do you. But YTA.", "All the adults suck here. It just seems icky that $400 is easily manageable but more than $50 would cause issues to vacation funds. Are you guys really thinking that spending $300 on the niece and a little more on the step son is really treating your niece that different? I feel awful for the step son, I can\u2019t imagine it feels good being reminded how much he isn\u2019t a part of the family.", "NTA. Let\u2019s do a thought experiment: if your brother were to divorce, you\u2019d surely continue seeing your niece regularly. His stepson, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019d never see him again - even the stepfather, there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019d never see him. The point is, your brother\u2019s stepson is not equivalent to your niece - just as your niece likely does have the same relationship with her stepbrother\u2019s relatives as he does. The relationships are not equivalent - no need to get them equivalent gifts.", "NTA. There\u2019s equal, and there\u2019s fair.     \n\nIt\u2019s *fair* that the nephew received gifts (let\u2019s be real, no gifts would\u2019ve been really messed up), but it doesn\u2019t have to be *equal* to what the niece received.", "YTA. It's not great to begin with that you all spoil the niece so much to begin with because it really is going to ruin her down the road in life. And the behavior regarding the step son is basically telling him he's not family, if he's a good kid and the mom is good for OPs brother I don't know why you wouldn't treat them as full family.", "It kind of feels like every adult here is the A. The focus on $ gives me the ICK.", "Oh lord, NTA\n\nNew stepmom is already looking to stir family drama", "YTA!!!", "spoiling your bloody niece is very nice and definitely not your job so it\u2019s just good for you guys to do that, even though it should be your brother (her dad) doing most the spoiling. But the same rule applies, it\u2019s your brothers step son, so that\u2019s your step nephew, have no real blood connection to him so if you don\u2019t want to spoil him that seems fair. Even buying him $50 gifts is nice. But at the end that should be your brother\u2019s responsibility to spoil him. It\u2019s kinda shitty for you guys to treat them at least a little more equal but it\u2019s definitely not an obligation so..\n\nNTA, but if your brother starts to spoil his daughter less and his son more to makeup for what you guys do because he wants both of his now children to be equal you guys better not give him shit for it.", "NTA.

The fact that the \"cheapest\" gift she's gotten is $400... That's kind of absurd to be honest. You really should cut back.  It sounds like on her birthday you guys are splurging close to 3k or even more is nuts.  \n\nYou shouldn't be expected to gift huge gifts to the step son whom you have no relationship with.

She is and will always be our only niece so naturally we all love her very much and we spoil her.\n\nThe problem is the same brother remarried recently and his wife has a 16yo son. This was unexpected considering even his daughter was an accident so none of us really expected him to marry a woman who has a child. \n\nThe issue is we all love spending all of our money to go to expensive vacations and any money that we have left gets spent on my niece. A few months ago was her birthday and the cheapest gift she received cost 400 dollars. As I said we all enjoy spoiling her.\n\nA few days ago was the stepson's birthday and we all bought nice gifts costing approximately 50 dollars each.\n\nMy SIL is mad because we bought more expensive gifts for my niece but I don't know what else she expects.

It clearly sends the message that they don't see him as family. Also, the stepson isn't demanding, or even asking for anything. But, OP and her family are laying the foundations for this boy to feel othered and unwanted by her family by treating him with such a disparity compared to the niece.   \n\nSure, the AITA motto \"you don't owe them anything!\" is technically true.

As a married couple and the parents/step parents of the children, he and SIL have the right to set boundries regarding gift giving, and should you choose to ignore said boundries, YTA.\n2. Change is hard; it's also one of few constants in life.  Your family has gained two new members, which is a gift (even if you don't like what you got, it's important to remember we can't choose family, we receive them).   OP failed to include in post how their family feels about the brother's wife/step-son, other than being \"suprised\" by his choice.  If you're causing friction in your brother's marriage b/c you just don't like the change in status quo, YTA.\n3. Being genereous when you have the means, doesn't nessesarily create entitlement, but it can (does) create expectation.  You've all spent fourteen years doting on your neice, and should you suddenly stop (meaning your brother and SIL put boundries in place, and your family accepts them), there's a possibility of resentment between your neice and her step-brother.  If this if the outcome and your brother/ SIL take no action to resolve it, then your NTA, they are.\n\nBoth OP and SIL have valid points; it's a tricky situation, which if mishandled, could go sideways quickly.  Since your family loves to vacation, perhaps incorporating these kiddos into some of your travel plans would be a great compromise, in lieu of expensive gifts.  They're both old enough to be somewhat self-sufficient (both far past the wiping-their-own-bottom-phase) and can participate many adult-ish activities.  Who knows?  You all might end up closer as result; then you get to look back, laugh, and wonder what all the fuss about.\n\nAnd if not, at least you tried.", "Your niece gets at minimum 2400 per birthday. That is more than I had for Christmas and my birthday for 4 years. Nobody needs such expensive things especially at that age. I would suggest putting the money towards something much better e.g a college fund for her in the future, or a savings for her for emergencies, saving for a car etc. \n\nYou don\u2019t have an obligation to buy your step nephew anything, 50 is still a lot of money for a birthday gift per child. However I can see why SIL is upset. Yea he\u2019s not entitled to anything but you must feel like shit and unwanted when your younger step sister gets 2400 at minimum per special event and he gets maybe 300. She\u2019s gonna have much better stuff and more of it which probably makes him feel very unwanted and shitty. Not to mention the possibility of your niece showing off all her expensive stuff. \n\nYou\u2019re ETA for spending that much on gifts in the first place ( there is a high likelihood she is spoiled and could turn into a entitled brat that demands and expects things ) I get you want to spoil her, but that amount just isn\u2019t necessary. The reason you\u2019re not Y T A is because you haven\u2019t known your step nephew long, however now they are in a blended family, and he is you\u2019re nieces step brother, that means he is now family and should be treated as an equal.", "Fam is all fucked up.

The niece was practically raised by these people, she is an only child and the bond they share is way more deep. The other kid is 16 which is semi adult, it is unfair on him to have a relationship with these people and unfair these people too.

One of them even went so far as to count the number and amount on Christmas gifts to each child (I told her that wasn't necessary, but fairness was important to her). Honestly, I was nearly brought to tears when I asked my future brother in law where my son was near the end of a family dinner and he said, \"saying goodbye to the cousins, Uncle [his name] will go get him.\" It's been 3 years, and my son has felt nothing but love from the entire family.

But I'm not pushing that agenda here. \n\nThe thing is, they do not like kids except for the niece, and do not see or expect any additions to their family (hence calling the niece happy accident), they at most could respect their brother's decision and try their best to do their part (giving a gift to a teen... Yeah I never receive a gift as a teen??), but you can't force them to instantly treat someone like how they treat their niece for 14 years. That one is a strong connection, like a close old friend or a dear child you have raise; and people shouldn't be expected to treat others that way instantly. It takes time, and maybe they'll grew to love him or not, who knows the point is they're not obligated in any way to him. They also have their own life beyond trying to do their best for their brother's child.", "Yes, it's clear that OP (if this is real) simply cannot comprehend welcoming a new person to the family. I wonder how she treats in-laws, and how her relationship with Nephew changes as he becomes an adult (doubt it will at all, unfortunately).", "They might know the neighbours child better than the brothers STEP son. I wouldn't be giving expensive gifts to a child I'd just met. The SIL is entitled and greedy expecting them to do this.", "They didn\u2019t blend when the step-son was very young. He\u2019s a teenager, 2 years away from\nCollege. You really don\u2019t see why that matters for purposes of why he doesn\u2019t get treated the same as the kid that the family watched grow up?", "So? I mean I know it is fine. There will always be someone who'll have less than you, so do you still eat Ramen or eat whatever you can afford in the best range? If they are complaining about the color, it is fine. They aren't asking money from you, right? If they are way within the range and their parents are fine, why are you worried? \n\nSome people have earned money and they'll use it. I know it may hurt to see but it is what it is.", "Why are you worried? Jealous that they can afford stuff.\nEven the poorest kids can be brats, it is more about upbringing.", "Exactly!", "I completely understand not feeling like family immediately - of course that won't happen and to think otherwise is setting everyone up for failure. However, everyone knows that relationships are built through effort, and not showing effort to your sibling's child is wild to me. While I understand they are child-free, I do not believe showing basic welcoming behavior you would show to a sibling's new gf (let alone spouse and son) is too much to ask. Why wouldn't you treat their **spouse** as family and, bare minimum, make an effort for your sibling?\n\nIf this is truly only about the cost disparity in the gifts, I take back my judgment (again, do not care about the money, and do not think the solution here is to throw more money at the problem via college funds, etc.). I'm more concerned about the slim likelihood that OP's disdain for any child other than Niece is hidden/not causing Nephew harm. I have to question what info is being left out of the conversation,\n\nAll I can imagine is if I was adopted 10 years later in life and my aunts/uncles excluded me to such a degree, I would be angry and, frankly, my mom wouldn't allow that behavior to continue. Because you're right; Nephew is not dumb. He knows Niece is loved more and he will never have a truly supportive relationship with his family because of it. And it's sad OP doesn't care.", "This is the exact sentiment that leads step children being neglected, adopted and step children are still part of a family, even if they aren\u2019t related by blood. They aren\u2019t lesser because of it.", "Exactly. OP is treating the boy like an inconvenience, rather than being excited to have a bonus nephew. Poor kid.", "Ffs. \"They're not obligated in any way to him.\" \n\nYou really had to go with the \"donating to people in need\" in order to show kindness? How about they show kindness to the new members of their *family*. \n\nYou're expecting a hell of a lot of understanding and grace from a teenager who has had his life uprooted and changed in the past year, yet your response to the idea of the *adults* in the family showing kindness *to him, a child*, is, \"they're not obligated in any way to him\". Wow. You expect a lot from a kid, but completely excuse the adults who are being assholes *to* the kid. \n\nThe way you *build* a strong connection with such a kid is to treat him as part of the family, not like some distant acquaintance while he watches his stepsister get treated like the golden child. \n\n\"Maybe they'll grow to love him or not\"??? He's a kid. You're sounding really callous and uncaring right now.", "Not what I\u2019m saying *at all*, no one has to bring them down to their level, but it doesn\u2019t cost anything to rant about something like a color of an iPhone to a different person. \nDoing that comes off as very \u201cfirst person problem\u201d. For an example- \u201cwhat\u2019s your biggest issue?\u201d \u201cMy dad accidentally bought me the wrong phone\u201d vs \u201cmy mom\u2019s getting a second job so we can eat\u201d. \n\nVery different on the spectrum and doesn\u2019t need to be brought up around the same time, You know?", "So are they supposed to not give a shit about the SIL either? Like at Christmas does she get a fruit cake and a stuffed stocking aka the bare minimum?  Either you treat family like family or you treat them differently and with favoritism. It shouldnt matter if theyre 6 or 16.  You are gonna be family as long as your brother is married to them.  The favoritism will certainly be apparent.", "And the entitlement to college fund lol. If step children are going to be neglected then the mother should think before marrying someone well off just for the money lol. The mother should be able to afford nice gifts for her kids instead of begging.  \n\nThey are family and will be treated the same but they aren't entitled to money, inheritance etc. Also, the OP doesn't feel the same. \nThe stepmother's family should gift the niece the same. Then let's see.", "whatever", "They gave him gifts. $50 presents isn\u2019t the bare minimum. \n\nAnd while they\u2019ll technically be family for as long as the brother is married to her, let\u2019s be real in the fact that this kid is likely only to be at a few years worth of family gatherings. This is especially true if he his father\u2019s side that he is close with. \n\nFact is, in a few years, this kid will likely not be attending extended family gatherings on his step-dad\u2019s side. \n\nAnd even if the favoritism is apparent, so what? Why should they be expected to shell out hundreds just because the brother choose to marry someone with a teenager? If the kid was little and didn\u2019t understand why they were being treated, the argument would be valid. But this kid is 16 ffs. He\u2019s old enough to understand and be appreciate at the nice gifts he is receiving."]}
