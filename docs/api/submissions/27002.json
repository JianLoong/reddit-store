She is and will always be our only niece so naturally we all love her very much and we spoil her.\n\nThe problem is the same brother remarried recently and his wife has a 16yo son. This was unexpected considering even his daughter was an accident so none of us really expected him to marry a woman who has a child. \n\nThe issue is we all love spending all of our money to go to expensive vacations and any money that we have left gets spent on my niece. A few months ago was her birthday and the cheapest gift she received cost 400 dollars. As I said we all enjoy spoiling her.\n\nA few days ago was the stepson's birthday and we all bought nice gifts costing approximately 50 dollars each.\n\nMy SIL is mad because we bought more expensive gifts for my niece but I don't know what else she expects.

SIL is confused about how a blended family works. Could you all treat her son the same as your niece? Yes, but you're not obligated to. You've all known your niece since she was born. She's been family as long as she remembers. Her son doesn't have that same connection with you all. The only reason she expects the same treatment is because she wants the stuff. She's doesn't care about what the stuff represents. \n\nYour step nephew, in theory, has extended family from his mom and his dad. That extended family is not you all. You can be friendly and cordial, but at 16, this bond is just not going to be the same as it is with your niece. If she can't accept that, she needs to talk with a counselor about the intricacies of blended families.", "ESH except the step kid and the niece.  As a step parent, I can\u2019t ever imagine doing what you guys do.  Also have welcomed many extended family step kids into the mix and I always treat them equally.  No, you aren\u2019t required to treat them equally, but it is the kind thing to do.  You all go way overboard for your niece to a ridiculous excess.  That\u2019s not healthy for her either.  There is no reason she needs gifts where the cheapest is $400.  Why don\u2019t you all agree to tone down the gift giving for her and do something decent with the excess you have been spending, such as start an account for her for education or for use when she turns 21 or maybe get them both experiences instead of stuff.", "Hmmm. Seven siblings and almost every single one was parentified? And almost every single one got a vasectomy and is child free? And all can afford vacations and lavish gifts? (Rolls eyes)", "Honestly if my siblings were dropping more than $2k on my kids every birthday I\u2019d be upset without the discrepancy between kids.", "Your niece has been the only child in your family for 14 years so it\u2019s natural to spoil her and your choice/right to do so.  As for too much spoiling being harmful to her\u2026well\u2026 if there weren\u2019t changes in the family situation, would that even be in question?  I mean, if it wasn\u2019t an issue before, it shouldn\u2019t be now.  Both kids are teenagers, not littles who maybe wouldn\u2019t understand.  It sounds to me you\u2019re being very generous to both kids, your SIL shouldn\u2019t be trying to dictate what you do with your money.  NTA", "Personally, I think you are going to create entitlement issues down the track by multiple people spendings hundreds of dollars each in a gift for the niece. Why does she need such expensive things at her age? What does her father think of this and the fact his stepson is getting gifts worth much less? Whilst you don\u2019t owe the stepson an expensive present, you are contributing to likely resentment issues in the blended family. NTA, but getting there.", "Wow, this is such an alien concept to me. I had aunts and uncles bring in steps and halves to the family, and in our family you got treated the same regardless of blood. Even when my aunt was dating a man with kids for a short time, not even married (my immediate family met them all of one time), we sent birthday cards with money/gifts for the boyfriend's kids the same as we would for our actual cousins. \n\nOne of my uncles married a woman who already had kids. They became our cousins, even the one who had her own dad. After the divorce, the evil witch of a mother told the kids that my grandparents and the rest of the family didn't love them anymore. One time the girl saw my grandparents at the park and called out \"grandpa!\" before her mum took her away. It was just so sad; my grandparents never stopped thinking of those kids as their own grandkids, regardless of the divorce or lack of biological ties. The kids lived just a few minutes' walk away, and would have been welcome in the house anytime. \n\nSo yeah... it's kind of an alien concept to me to not treat blended family who married in to your family, as... *family*. \n\nI know a lot of people here are saying you don't know this kid, don't have the bond with him, he has his own extended family, he'll be off to college in a few years etc etc. But his mum is your brother's wife; it doesn't look like they're going anywhere. Would it *really* hurt to make the split a little more equal when spending on gifts? This kind of favouritism is exactly how you get people who hate their stepfamilies, when one kid in the house gets treated significantly different to the other. Sure, you don't know this kid *yet*. But you have the option to make him feel *properly* like part of the family rather than a visitor you're simply being polite to, and it's just really sad imo that you don't seem to care. \n\nYTA.", "Soft YTA.  I get that you're not as connected to the new stepson because you've only known him for a few months.  That doesn't justify such a disparity in the value of the gifts.  This is likely to cause a division in their family as they try to blend.  Lower the value of the gifts (say $200 instead of $400) and set aside the rest in a graduation/college fund for her.  She'll still get nice gifts and have extra when she's going to be starting her adult life.", "NTA\n\nYou have only known this stepson a short period of time so why would you provide the same level of gifts as a niece who you have known all her life. \n\nAnd a gift of $50 is not cheap for someone who is essentially a stranger to the family.\n\nIn the future, perhaps don't make the expensive gifts as obvious and give them to her privately.", "Yes, you do spend a lot on your niece, but it is your money. Here's my sticking point; How does your brother's decision to marry a single mother suddenly put YOU under an obligation to buy her son, well, anything?\n\nThere are hundreds of tales on Reddit of step parents treating their blended families badly, and it's your brother's responsibility to avoid that. You, I'd suggest, not so much. It's nice you spend as much as you do on your new step-nephew but that's at your discretion, not his mother's.\n\nYou are expressing 14 years of affection to the only close relative of that generation. Why you have to match that for a teenager that has become a relative by marriage only recently, well I don't see it. In fact, if your niece found out her birthday pot was now being halved with her new step-brother then she would be entitled to be upset. \n\nNTA", "YTA. If you\u2019re spending so lavishly on the niece that anything more than a $50 gift for the stepson will make a serious dent in your vacation spending then you\u2019re spending too much and creating havoc on the new family dynamic.", "YTA.   Guess I'm in the minority here. Nothing divides a family faster than treating kids differently.  Your brother will back his wife and then you all will lose.   I suggest balancing the scales a bit", "ESH, by the sounds of it this is a marriage less than a year, but likely there's been involvement for longer. While it's fair to not be expected to go full equal spend so early, a little closer a split would be better than such a big disparity.\n\nI'd also say you're not necessarily doing your niece a favour by spoiling her so much. I can't think what a 14 year old would need that would be looking at a minimum of $2400 being spent on one birthday in gifts from aunts and uncles. A quarter of that would be a blowout birthday, better instead to put towards education savings etc for down the line.", "I can see a NAH here.\n\nI get where you are coming from - you\u2019ve known your niece her entire life and she will always be a part of your life. You don\u2019t have that type of attachment with the step-nephew.\n\nI also get a mom getting riled up that there\u2019s a really LARGE gap between how the two children in her household are treated by her husband\u2019s family - in the hundreds ( to a thousand) difference.\n\nThere shouldn\u2019t be the expectation by the mom, but it does communicate that the stepson isn\u2019t seen as much a part of your family and there\u2019s no expectation/want of a relationship.", "ETA except the kids. You aren\u2019t obligated to give anyone a gift, but don\u2019t be upset or surprised if you aren\u2019t allowed in her life the same way if you don\u2019t knock it off.", "I would advise your SIL not to worry about it, as if what you\u2019ve said here is true you\u2019re all already teetering on the edge of financial disaster and sooner or later you won\u2019t be able to get presents for anyone.", "Your SIL sounds like an entitled gold digger. No one owes anyone a gift and certainly not a gift of a particular monetary value. She needs to check the definition of \u201cgift.\u201d NTA.", "YMMV, but I think OP's family should seriously learn some financial literacy. I don't know how much they're making, but spending all/most of your money on vacations and expensive gifts is *not sustainable*, either for your finances, your niece, or the environment.", "I'm going with yes you're the ah. Not for the price of the gift you gave your niece versus the price of the gift for your step nephew, but for your whole demeanor in this post and then the answers you've provided to questions. You come across as looking down on your brother for marrying a woman with a child. And while the sister-in-law should not have gotten upset over the price of a gift, did you stop to think that maybe that's not the real reason she's upset? That maybe she feels unaccepted by you and your family? That she feels her son is not accepted by you and your family? Did you stop to ask yourself that?\nAs for everyone saying oh there's a whole another family there's a dad blah blah blah, how do you know? How do you know that the dad is in the in the picture how do you know the dad's family is in the picture? You don't, you're just assuming. Stop to think maybe the sister-in-law is wanting this to be the step nephew's family because he doesn't have another one?", "I think YTA.\n\nIt's probably not reasonable for your SIL to expect you to treat her son exactly like your niece. This is a little girl that you all knew since she was a baby, probably helped raise at least a little. There's a different kind of bond there, and that's totally OK.\n\nWhere y'all went left was the great disparity between what the niece and the step nephew get. Do the gifts have to be exactly equal? No, but it *does* make a kid feel shitty when they're unequal to this degree. She's getting new phones and laptops and $400 headphones or whatever and he's getting, a video game? Even that's more than $50.\n\nI'm going to be honest, I was on the fence about this one. Like I said, you have an established relationship with this child, and nobody should be expecting this equality. It's just that I kind of thought about this focus on the amounts - like, you all know how much you each spent on the niece *and* the step-nephew, as if you planned this in concert somehow. (Maybe I'm stretching, I don't know!) but it was mores when you said\n\n>The only way we could afford better gifts was by using our vacation money or by changing the way we treat our niece, none of which we are willing to do\n\nWhich, like, spending a little less on your vacation so you could make your new step-nephew feel welcomed into the family feels like a good choice?", "SOFT YTA. Put yourself in the boy shoes. It\u2019s hard for him to. He has new people in his life. Sure, he doesn\u2019t expect 100% the sale treatment but the disparity is too much here. Put that money into her college funds. Spoil her a little bit more,  like 20-30% more. The boy has his other family too to spoil him. They just can\u2019t spoil him like 5 childfree adult can. Plus, your niece can use the money later to buy a house or something. The more money you put in your funds, the more you increase her quality of life in the future. She will thank you more for this. A 16 yo doesn\u2019t need thousands dollar gift lmao. Do this for the sake of your family. Your brother has a new son now, he wants him happy as much as his daughter. You should want that too. \n\nRegarding the college funds, have a little conversation with your brother about it when you feel like it\u2019s the right moment. Because yes, you will be more mindful of your gifts but be careful of his wife intention regarding the college funds. It\u2019s for your niece and her only. Except if your niece is willing to share. Have that conversation now to make sure that your his wife knows that you won\u2019t be paying for their son. Not your pig not your farm, they can start thinking now about saving for him if it\u2019s not done yet haha", "Sounds divisive. I feel bad for the kid who knows that their \u201cfamily\u201d think less of them. You could get 375$ gifts and throw in an extra 25$ each and still have a nice gift for niecy. \n\nBut, you know, if you think this kid deserves less, i guess you do you. But YTA.", "All the adults suck here. It just seems icky that $400 is easily manageable but more than $50 would cause issues to vacation funds. Are you guys really thinking that spending $300 on the niece and a little more on the step son is really treating your niece that different? I feel awful for the step son, I can\u2019t imagine it feels good being reminded how much he isn\u2019t a part of the family.", "NTA. Let\u2019s do a thought experiment: if your brother were to divorce, you\u2019d surely continue seeing your niece regularly. His stepson, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019d never see him again - even the stepfather, there\u2019s a good chance he\u2019d never see him. The point is, your brother\u2019s stepson is not equivalent to your niece - just as your niece likely does have the same relationship with her stepbrother\u2019s relatives as he does. The relationships are not equivalent - no need to get them equivalent gifts.", "NTA. There\u2019s equal, and there\u2019s fair.     \n\nIt\u2019s *fair* that the nephew received gifts (let\u2019s be real, no gifts would\u2019ve been really messed up), but it doesn\u2019t have to be *equal* to what the niece received.", "YTA. It's not great to begin with that you all spoil the niece so much to begin with because it really is going to ruin her down the road in life. And the behavior regarding the step son is basically telling him he's not family, if he's a good kid and the mom is good for OPs brother I don't know why you wouldn't treat them as full family.", "It kind of feels like every adult here is the A. The focus on $ gives me the ICK.", "Oh lord, NTA\n\nNew stepmom is already looking to stir family drama", "YTA!!!", "spoiling your bloody niece is very nice and definitely not your job so it\u2019s just good for you guys to do that, even though it should be your brother (her dad) doing most the spoiling. But the same rule applies, it\u2019s your brothers step son, so that\u2019s your step nephew, have no real blood connection to him so if you don\u2019t want to spoil him that seems fair. Even buying him $50 gifts is nice. But at the end that should be your brother\u2019s responsibility to spoil him. It\u2019s kinda shitty for you guys to treat them at least a little more equal but it\u2019s definitely not an obligation so..\n\nNTA, but if your brother starts to spoil his daughter less and his son more to makeup for what you guys do because he wants both of his now children to be equal you guys better not give him shit for it.", "NTA.

The fact that the \"cheapest\" gift she's gotten is $400... That's kind of absurd to be honest. You really should cut back.  It sounds like on her birthday you guys are splurging close to 3k or even more is nuts.  \n\nYou shouldn't be expected to gift huge gifts to the step son whom you have no relationship with.

She is and will always be our only niece so naturally we all love her very much and we spoil her.\n\nThe problem is the same brother remarried recently and his wife has a 16yo son. This was unexpected considering even his daughter was an accident so none of us really expected him to marry a woman who has a child. \n\nThe issue is we all love spending all of our money to go to expensive vacations and any money that we have left gets spent on my niece. A few months ago was her birthday and the cheapest gift she received cost 400 dollars. As I said we all enjoy spoiling her.\n\nA few days ago was the stepson's birthday and we all bought nice gifts costing approximately 50 dollars each.\n\nMy SIL is mad because we bought more expensive gifts for my niece but I don't know what else she expects. The only way we could afford better gifts was by using our vacation money or by changing the way we treat our niece, none of which we are willing to do\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Kid may not be brat, but still reasonable to think she could be. Way to virtue signal tho", "He meant bratwurst!", "Of course, we were taught the same. Of course it should be something given out of their own free will.\n\nBut to treat two teenagers who live in the same household, so radically differently? $400 *per gift* is a lot for a 14yo. Sure, you can argue that the stepson shouldn't \"expect\" such gifts, but continuing to shower such presents on the niece while not giving the stepson even half as much is just rude and othering. It clearly sends the message that they don't see him as family. Also, the stepson isn't demanding, or even asking for anything. But, OP and her family are laying the foundations for this boy to feel othered and unwanted by her family by treating him with such a disparity compared to the niece.   \n\nSure, the AITA motto \"you don't owe them anything!\" is technically true. But it's not *kind*. And maybe it's just the way my family raised me, but I can't imagine being so *unkind* to someone who has joined our family.", "Your comments make clear YTA.", "Thaf won't always be the case though", "Has your brother taught her that some have less than her so being grateful and humble is important?\ud83e\udd14\nAsking because I have some friends who have complained about being given the wrong color iPhone or other trivial things like that when my other friend couldn\u2019t even afford lunch at school- \nDon\u2019t let her be like that please", "For now, what about when she goes to college? Post grad? Out working in the world? She needs to be able to understand money doesn't grow on trees, or is that something only your step nephew needs to know?", ">All her peers living in our neighborhood have similar lives to her so she doesn't have a problem relating to them.\n\nShe will not be living in the same neighborhood her entire life, this is a REALLY flawed way of thinking", "Agree a hundred percent with this. The father of the niece is the real AH, if there is one, for not mitigating this issue sooner.", "Exactly!!!", "His kid clearly doesn't need the money and this level of spoiling is abuse, regardless of how much the kid may enjoy it. It will twist her personality and that is not ok. Whatever her aunt and uncles think, that boy is now her brother and they have to learn to be a nuclear family. The rest of them have zero right to interfere in their family dynamic and they are intentionally trying to make it as toxic and hostile as possible.", "Decent people welcome in-laws and step-siblings into the family (because they ARE now family).\n\n\nDecent people treat in-laws and step-siblings in the same manner that they do their bio family members (because they ARE family).\n\n\nAnd decent people buy gifts for in-laws and step-siblings just as they would for their bio parents and siblings because THEY ARE ALL FAMILY.\n\n\nThey may not have bonded for as long or as deeply, but that's true within bio families too - some members your are closer to than others.  But none of that makes it ok to treat them as \"less than\" (especially when we are talking about children!).  They are still treated like family because they ARE all family.\n\n\nBut as I said...  This only applies to decent people, not AHs.\n\n\n(And we can clearly see which category OP is in.)", "No. Step kid is entitled to nothing but nominal gifts if there is some kind of gift giving event like Christmas that he's present for. \n\n Step kid has a bio mother and a bio father and their families. And if bio father is out of the picture, that still does not affect anything. \n\nIt would be different if OP's father had actually raised the boy from very young and had adopted him. That's not the case here.", "Out of the home doesn't mean out of their lives. OP's already said that they're paying for the niece's college, so I think it's pretty clear that they're not going to just cut her off at 18. This level of favoritism will be obvious as long as they have a life together.", "That boy if American will leave in 2 years for college and rarely see her. Pls the aren't young they are teens who get to choose for themselves what relationship they want to have!! And what then if their parents separate (I've had 2 sets of step siblings, no idea about any of them now since my dad split with their mums \ud83d\ude02).\n\nThey aren't interfering they are doing what they have done for the past 14 years!!! Oh and unless the kid is a brat with no boundaries it isn't abuse, that's a fucking serious accusation, that's a kin to saying parents who can't afford presents for their kids are abusive. The father and I'm assuming her own mum have had no issue with this for 14 years and frankly if she's a brat or twisted then it is on the parents for not stepping in before hand.", "Oh and to add the only issue the new sil has is about presents not how they actually treat the 16 year old sssooo not sure where you are getting this toxic and hostile shit from. Explain to the kid who probably doesn't see them as real aunts and uncles at his age anyway that sometimes people are treated different, probably like his real family treat him different from his stepsister.", "But they did buy a damn gift it just wasn't to the liking of the new sil \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\n\nWhere has OP said they haven't welcomed the new people, other than this gift which frankly be thankful for a fucking gift, jesus I'm happy with socks.\n\nNaw, if my acceptance of someone hinges on how much I spend on them then they are the 1s who aren't decent \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f. If they can't accept the bond and understand the lifelong relationship with someone else then they aren't decent and I can bet your arse sils own parents will treat their grandson different from OPs neice.\n\nI've had stepsiblings in fact my dad had 2 previous partners with kids, I was treated same by their family and thaf was cool I had my own family. I also have no clue where they are or anything because step siblings don't alway hang around especially when they are forced together as teens.\n\nBy the way, decent people don't demand money!!", "I wasn\u2019t suggesting they were going to cut him off at 18. And I certainly never said anything about the family cutting the niece off. My point was that the boy (the step nephew) is going to be out of the home in a few years. \n\nI am saying that the extended family on the niece\u2019s side will likely not see him much once he\u2019s an adult though. Why? Because at 16, he\u2019s unlikely to really see them as his family to begin with and isn\u2019t all that likely to stay in touch with them. \n\nAgain, he\u2019s 16, not 6. He\u2019s old enough to understand and can get over it. Does he have to like it? No. But that doesn\u2019t mean he can\u2019t understand it and be taught reasonable expectations. \n\nAnd this isn\u2019t favoritism. You\u2019d have an argument if they were little. But again, he\u2019s 16. The brother married the woman with the child. That doesn\u2019t mean your family is going to automatically love this 16 year old kid that they don\u2019t know. And it sure as hell doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re going to feel the same way about him as they do the 14 year old niece they\u2019ve known since she was born.", "Actually we have no idea if the actual parents have an issue with it, because OP is the aunt and is intentionally speaking only from her POV. Like when she claims she can't afford to spend less on the girl. Nobody buys their own child new phones every year. Normal parents don't actually like giving their children their every whim.", "There you go again talking about \"real\" family. They are siblings now, regardless of how this aunt or YOU feel about it. Do you also believe adopted and foster children should be excluded since they aren't genetically tied to the family?", "Nope, the gifts were so obviously unequivocal that it's not enough to say \"but they both got gifts!\".\n\n\nIt would be like if they bought the niece a car and bought the step-nephew a remote control one.  (And yes, a remote control car is indeed a lovely gift... until you realize that it's actually a slap in the face compared to what their sibling got. Which this example clearly is - and OP is trying to justify it by claiming that of course they love the \"actual niece\" more.  Not cool!!!)\n\n\nNobody's demanding money.  They're just saying that more equivocal gift-giving would go a long way towards making one kid not feel like shit.\n\n\n\nEdit: changed daughter to niece"]}
