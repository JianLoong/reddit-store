So just having a bike ride with no plans to go somewhere to refresh in the air conditioning afterwards and at the very least have cold drinks, which in this case happened to be at a pizza place, was NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.  Apparently lots of people like to do strenuous activity out in the heat and that's all.  Literally none of us, except her, would have shown up to an event like that.  \"You can't just\" NO, and I wasn't going to.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm the organizer of a social meetup group. We have lots of activities to do on a regular basis, that we all enjoy. Usually it's eating out, but also fun things like movies, bowling, farmer's market, potlucks at various members' houses if they are able to host, grilling in the park.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have one member who asked me if I could please schedule activities for the group that are \"free\", because she is poor and can't afford activities that cost money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFine, we can come up with some free or at least very low cost activities to do, but I also have to consider the rest of the group and what they want.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI didn't mind the first several times she reminded me to \"remember to schedule FREE activities for those of us on a budget!\", but then I started to get mad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEspecially after I organized three activities that were free -- the visit to the farmer's market, the visit to the nature center, and a bike ride around the college campus -- specifically so she could participate, and she didn't show up.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe said that the farmer's market was \"not free.\" It sure can be, if you don't buy anything.

It was a picnic in the park we were having. I bought the ice chest and portable grill so we could have this fun activity, which WAS fun. But it was not free!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo apparently her feelings were hurt because I told her what this activity cost me to set up -- and I didn't mind buying the portable grill and ice chest.

You also have to be willing to ask people to leave the group or ban people from it. I don\u2019t think what she has done warrants banning her from the group up to now - but you do need to put her in her place. You are not Walmart - you are running a meetup group. She is always nagging you and then not showing up when you do something she wants. She seems to be always unhappy and the more you try to do for her the more unhappy she gets.

People who've never had to undertake organizing weekly social activities have zero clue how much time, effort, and- yes- personal financial cost that entails. I worked hard to plan activities that were largely free or low-cost to them. I'd sometimes ask for $5 to help cover the cost of items I needed for certain activities, which only helped offset the cost; it never fully covered it. \n\nI'll share one idea that might help you in dealing with the sort of woman who's currently frustrating you.

That sounds great! You are definitely welcome to plan that as I'm sure plenty of families would enjoy doing it.

We've done the following free things in the past \\[insert exhaustive list of free stuff you've planned\\], and I've run out of ideas. I'm really looking forward to seeing what you come up with! Thanks for taking that on.\" Literally, rinse and repeat that exact same statement every time. She can either come up with her own ideas--- which would be a win-win scenario--- or learn to suck it up.\n\nOh, and one free idea for you: selfie scavenger hunts. When we lived near a mall, I'd plan one each Christmas. The heavy social part as in the hunt itself. If people wanted to go to the food court for a drink and/or snack afterwards, they could. You can do the hunts anywhere, though.

I got quite a lot done, but there were people badgering me a lot, so I told them if they thought they could do better to go ahead. Within two days they lost us late night transport from a off campus workshop we had classes in until 9pm at night. Within the month they had lost thier place as studen reps for not attending student union meetings, leaving our course without a union rep. I tried lobbying the student union to reinstate the student transport we needed for our workshop accross town but no dice, they weren't listening to me anymore as I was no longer a rep. So lobbied the university.  I managed to get the university to put transport on for students using that workshop late at night. It didn't come in for my year, but subsequent years got the benefit of it\n\nMy take away from that was, when you are organising anything, your loudest detractors are usually the people who appreciate what you do the least and are least prepared to put in even fraction of the effort if fCed with doing it themselves.", "NTA", "Since you've offered for her to organize free events herself, I don't see where you've been unreasonable.

She didn't show for any of the above.\n\nAs I've stated numerous times in my comments, SHE REQUESTED THE BIKE RIDE, SO YES SHE DID HAVE A BIKE.\n\nAnd as I've stated numerous times in my comments, we live in a hot climate, so having a strenuous outdoor activity in the heat without any plans to go anywhere to cool off and refresh afterwards wasn't going to happen.\n\nShe could have scheduled and hosted just a bike ride with no plans afterwards, and she'd have been there by herself because literally no one else wanted to do that.", "There was a person who was always complaining about what the condo board did in the Yahoo group, but he did actually run for the board once, and won. I voted for him, not because I thought he could do a good job, but because I hoped it would be a reality check, and I suspect I wasn't the only one.\n\nSure enough, he did a bad job, didn't run again, and got a lot quieter.", "NTA then.", "Listen? You mean read. \n\nWhy would I read all the other comments to find out other things, if you have information pertinent to the question then write the info for everyone to see in the main question. \n\nYou couldn\u2019t all pack lunches to eat on the bike ride?", "The OP said he arranged free activities and this woman didn't even bother to show up for them.\n\nAgain - why does everyone else have to be penalized because of 1 person?", "None of us wanted to.  If we had, we would have.  Have you ever lived in a hot climate?", "The activities described in OPs original post were not free. Itbwas shopping,  which sucks for people with no money and it was an event that included a meal thatbyou had to pay for (not 2 separate events... OP suggested leaving early). The rest of the things in the comment above were free, but were not mentioned in the original post.  Again... why are you considering free things a penalty?", "Yes", "She'd always bring something organic, which is fine, bring what  you like to eat.  I think THAT was the real issue -- she's VEGAN, not broke.", "she wasn't broke at all I don't think.  She's VEGAN and that's what her motive was.  To have potlucks and picnics so she could bring her own vegan fare, which is fine, but sometimes we're going to eat out too and she couldn't accept that.", "Ah... self-imposed exile it is.", "Oh wow that makes her even more of an AH. I\u2019m (almost exclusively) vegetarian and I never make others accommodate my dietary preferences. People who make an entire group change plans to accommodate them are exhausting. OP you are 100% NTA\n\nEdit: so then wtf was her problem with the farmer\u2019s market?", "She\u2019s acting like this is a social group that she HAS to be a part of. She needs to find another group. Also, she may just be waiting for you to say, \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it, I\u2019ll buy your pizza\u201d, etc.", "NTA.. very few things are free.. and most things end in drinks and food because we like drinks and food, but there's no reason she couldn't bring her own jug of ice water and hang out with the group afterward.  being the organizer is a thankless job, try not to let it get to you.  I've learned youll never please everyone and there's always that contingent that has Something To Say about. how you do things but if you did them their way there's another contingent...", "NTA I had some experience with Meetup group organizing. There is always someone bitching and complaining. Tell them to organize their own events. End of the story.\nAlso - having a meet up group isn\u2019t free. I assume you are paying the fee to keep the group active on Meetup.", "I actually have experienced similar situations. I organize events and host all the time because if I don\u2019t, no one will. Most of the cost of things come out of my pockets but it\u2019s made up for by the fact that people always let me drink for free. I have some friends that won\u2019t come to anything they have to pay for but at this point I just don\u2019t care. They just won\u2019t be there and that\u2019s fine", "NTA.  Too many people are either don't stop to think about, or are willfully ignorant of, the fact that NOTHING is \"free\" - if they're getting it for nothing, someone else is paying for it.", "NTA, SHE CAN REMIND YOU, SHE CAN PLAN THEM.", "Let her be in charge of planning the free events. Problem solves itself.", "INFO: are you using an app or a website for organizing your events? My group does events too, but we really want to get away from Facebook", "meetup dot com", "These are not regular friends - it\u2019s a social meetup group. This member has done nothing to \u201cdeserve\u201d anything. She should look for or form a free activities meetup group if that\u2019s all she\u2019s interested in doing.", "People want to give their opinions but don\u2019t want to do the work to make it happen.  I planned company events all the time for my work and every time a committee was formed to help me, no one did anything but had plenty of opinions. I did all the work and planning without any help from the committees but they took all the glory and praise from the boss when the event was done.", "Thank you! Appreciate the answer", "If she really were my friend, and she were having a rough time, I'd front her the money to come eat with us.   She wasn't.  \n\nAnd who do these people think they are, that they can tell other people not to go out for food and drink after an outdoor event, and if they do, they must hate poor people?  \n\nThe people who don't want to go, don't have to go.  But no, we're not having an outdoor strenuous activity in the HEAT without something fun and refreshing afterwards.  Not happening.", "then sit in the heat to your heart's content.  I'm not.", "You\u2019re welcome to do what you want, but IMO, you\u2019re an AH and you\u2019re \u201cfriend\u201d deserves better than someone with such an entitled attitude.", "I'm definitely being one at the moment, yes.", "farmers = animals!", "Probably self restraint. Like if you took me to a yarn store or a book store or something. If I don\u2019t want to spend oodles of money, I just have to stay away. Or scarves.\n\nMaybe she\u2019d spend too much money at a farmers market? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NTA.\n\nHer financial hardship is not your nor your group's problem. You added in some free activities - and yes, they WERE free - and she chose to not show up. What she really wants is someone to finance her share of the activities, but again, not your issue. She's being rude, feel free to tell her so and invite her to find another group to badger.", "ESH, so unless you're going to need to spend money biking is out? Bring water with you.", "NTA but you did really still schedule a lot of activities that made it difficult to socialize. Not many can bike and talk at the same time for instance. I\u2019d say maybe see about arranging something where if people are down they can donate a small fund for low income/no income people to be able to participate. It could be a first come first service thing but would be a good way to help people if y\u2019all were interested. It\u2019s absolutely not required imo to do this. It\u2019s just a suggestion on ways that y\u2019all could include others. Like a little group fund for water and things like that. Could do a group fund for pizza where everyone puts in what they can and y\u2019all just get a lot of large pizzas. Or do potlucks where it\u2019s not mandatory to bring things and people sign up for bringing stuff. Lot of options is all I\u2019m saying.", "She\u2019ll schedule a potluck, bring nothing and take home leftovers.", "THIS. She's being difficult for no reason at all. You planned free activities and she found ways to make them not free. The farmers market and the bike ride were perfect examples. I'll bet if you planned a trip to a museum on a day that was free, she'd have complained she couldn't participate in the optional tours/exhibits/programs that cost a few bucks. OR that she couldn't buy something at the gift shop. OR that she needed to pay for gas on the way there. There's absolutely no pleasing some people. NTA at all.", "Also game nights, geocaching, workshops with SMEs from the group, free lectures/talks if you live near a college, book/movie discussion group with coffee at someone's house. There are tons of lower cost activities. But if you don't want to organize these that's your choice. Does your group have an expectation of spending range $ at the events you plan?", "Can you imagine her reaction if she did plan a free activity and no one showed up", "Oh I think I misunderstood the way the group is. It sounded like an official program of sorts. Since it\u2019s not. I feel most of my answer is invalid. They can still be done. But it\u2019s much less feasible I think if it\u2019s a less organized thing and more of just a group of people literally doing shit.", "But OP isn\u2019t curious about hiking spots. They don\u2019t like hiking. Other people do, but they don\u2019t want to do any organizing work. OP shouldn\u2019t have to do the work to organize an event they either won\u2019t enjoy or won\u2019t attend.", "That\u2019s very fair but if they had really wanted to I\u2019m just providing an excellent resource. It\u2019s also available to anyone in the comments."]}
