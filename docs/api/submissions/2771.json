How did you get here?\n\nAll jokes aside, I used to help run a couple social groups and I recently stepped down after a few years, and part of it was due to issues like this- it\u2019s understandable some people can\u2019t afford sushi dinners but if they ignore park walks and demand other people give up their houses to host events- and keep demanding things! Honestly, I was telling people at the end to plan their ideal event if they wanted so bad but so many wanted someone else to do it or it was too hard or they didn\u2019t have a venue. NTA btw", "Are you sure she is poor? most poor people try to hide it make excuses why they don't go.

Thank you for volunteering to organize that.\u201d", "NTA. She wants to bring up costs but doesn't like when you do? Wow.\n\nI am curious though : does she have a bike? If not, then that wasn't a free activity.

Going out to dinner all depends on what you order.  If you order just a salad and a drink, it can cost less.

But I do agree with the rest of what you said, and I'm sure it's annoying.

Also, the have-nots waving bye to the haves halfway through an outing when they depart for more costly pleasures is pretty awkward and depressing.

Why do you think that's a \"free\" activity? Sure, bike riding can be free... but yes, the pizza after is not free. Do something that actually IS free... you could have gone to a park with a grill.", "YTA. She just wants to participate, and you can't seem to get it through your head what free means. The farmer's market makes little sense if you can't spend any money, not even for snacks. \n\n And   \ne bike ride was because we also planned to go out for pizza   \nafterwards. She could have come bike riding with us, and then skipped   \nout on the pizza if she didn't want to spend money.\n\nSo you were excluding her from the social part of the activity, got it.\n\nIs it really hard to schedule one thing a month that doesn't have some kind of cost associated with it?

You\u2019ve been more than fair and she didn\u2019t come to the free events you tried to set up.", "NTA. What were her suggestions?", "NTA. Nothing wrong with telling the truth. Are you planning all of the events? If you are, stop. \n\nIf this group is important to the other members they should take turns planning outings.

Suggest that each household take a turn and that you start with Ms. \"I want everything for free\".", "NTA\n\nIf you are going to run groups you have to realize that you can\u2019t accommodate everyone. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to try to be all things to all people. Some people just won\u2019t be suited for your group and that\u2019s ok. You also have to be willing to ask people to leave the group or ban people from it. I don\u2019t think what she has done warrants banning her from the group up to now - but you do need to put her in her place. You are not Walmart - you are running a meetup group. She is always nagging you and then not showing up when you do something she wants. She seems to be always unhappy and the more you try to do for her the more unhappy she gets. If you continue to let her whims get to you she\u2019ll end up making you discouraged and you\u2019ll quit. \n\nFocus on what activities will be best for the group as a whole. If you don\u2019t want to schedule a pot luck then don\u2019t. She can join another group that does or start her own meetup group.

Tell her you will be happy to consider them once in a while but that the majority of the group wants xyz and if she wants to participate in those fine - but you can\u2019t run a whole group just to accommodate her.

Remind her of this every time she brings it up and maybe look for another group to suggest to her that is always free. She should not complain if she cannot contribute ideas and then blow off events that are free. Explaining to her that even a free for her event costs money is a fact and she should be thankful that you were able to spend the money and she was not asked to or required to chip in.", "Good lord, NTA.

Those were lots of fun, but yes, crowded.", "Then feel free to start your own social group where you schedule nothing but absolutely free activities that cost no one anything.

If I can't afford to go to something, I mention it, and don't attend when my finances won't allow me to go. Not the groups problem if I can't afford it. I cant exactly expect them to change or make plans based on my lower income. There is usually something I can do that's planned eventually.", "You sound amazing. I do not have the energy to do that. I think she just isn't going to fit into the group. You tried different activities and she skipped them. If she wants to plan a picnic where she is only responsible for her food or plan an outing to a park or a library, she can do so according to your group rules. She just wants you to pay and pretend you didn't.\n\nOh! Museums have free days if that works and libraries might have free passes. I borrowed a pass to go to a museum and it was good for four or six people. I'm not saying you need to keep trying but just ideas for your group or pass that along to her and wish her well.\n\nEta: I want to point out that hiking isn't necessarily free so I don't know why people keep harping on that. In order to hike, you need adequate equipment like proper shoes, maybe a day pack, etc...\n\nI also window shop all the time so going to a farmer's market and not buying anything is okay by me.

Sometimes the free admission happens once a month.", "I see you've never heard of Tin Foil. Great new invention, very cheap, probably already have some in your larder. Maybe?", "A bike ride without the pizza, a hike, a game day in the park are just a few activities that could be done for free. If you do not want to organize these things, why even be an organizer? And if you cannot accept judgement, why post to this sub? YTA.", "And the extra time and effort to research, schedule, organize, etc. Onus is on her to make suggestions, and schedule free events. You've tried your best to accommodate.", "I like this approach! \n\nWhat I don't understand is why she is on at you about organising free activities when that isn't the focus of your group. Are there not other groups arranging activities that are free?

People who've never had to undertake organizing weekly social activities have zero clue how much time, effort, and- yes- personal financial cost that entails. I worked hard to plan activities that were largely free or low-cost to them. I'd sometimes ask for $5 to help cover the cost of items I needed for certain activities, which only helped offset the cost; it never fully covered it. \n\nI'll share one idea that might help you in dealing with the sort of woman who's currently frustrating you. I had a few moms over the years who would send me stuff and say, \"Wouldn't this be a fun thing to do?\" It was always something that would be a huge headache in terms of collecting money, getting the right number to commit, getting a day everyone would agree on, etc. I'd respond back, \"Yeah! That sounds great! You are definitely welcome to plan that as I'm sure plenty of families would enjoy doing it. Just let me know if you want/need a spot on the calendar and I'll set it aside for you.\" Needless to say, not one of those 'fun ideas' ever saw the light of day.\n\nIn the future, learn to respond with, \"Yeah, free activities are always great! Why don't you do some research on some stuff we can do and let me know what day you want to host it on. I'll make sure to add it to the calendar as soon as you let me know! We've done the following free things in the past \\[insert exhaustive list of free stuff you've planned\\], and I've run out of ideas. I'm really looking forward to seeing what you come up with! Thanks for taking that on.\" Literally, rinse and repeat that exact same statement every time. She can either come up with her own ideas--- which would be a win-win scenario--- or learn to suck it up.\n\nOh, and one free idea for you: selfie scavenger hunts. When we lived near a mall, I'd plan one each Christmas. The heavy social part as in the hunt itself. If people wanted to go to the food court for a drink and/or snack afterwards, they could. You can do the hunts anywhere, though.

The sense of entitlement that has run rampant in our culture is astounding. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll I can\u2019t personally do this so I need everyone to accommodate me personally because I deserve it\u201d \n\n\ud83d\ude12 Yeah, no Susan that\u2019s no one else\u2019s problem or obligation. Especially after you were nice enough to intentionally accommodate her and she repays your effort and kindness by not showing up and essentially slapping you in the face? \n\nAnd then had the audacity to harass you and guilt you more to accommodate her? And THEN tries to guilt you even more by taking you setting healthy boundaries and communication by letting her know the reality of the situation, that being her personal social event coordinator is not \u201cfree\u201d it\u2019s just another person (of I am sure you are not the first) picking up her tab, turning that into some personal attack on her. The ICK I feel can\u2019t be measured. \n\nRude. Entitled. Awful. Hate this woman already. And I say this as someone who grew up in poverty. Like scary can we eat today poverty. \n\nYou\u2019re good people OP \u2764\ufe0f \n\nTell this broad she can check the regular schedule for what works for her but there are no more personal accommodations, she doesn\u2019t like it?

Your suggestion was basically \u201cdon\u2019t come if you can\u2019t afford it.\u201d Seems like that\u2019s what she did. \n\nI wonder whether you invited her to share some ideas about free activities in your city? In your post, it sound like you may be coming off as not open to suggestions when you aren\u2019t really picking low cost activities. I\u2019m guessing you aren\u2019t giving an open vibe when you say how difficult leading the group is and you shamed her because you made the choice to spend money on a picnic meet up. The bike ride + pizza sounds fun, but your group member might be REALLY uncomfortable or embarrassed about her financial situation. It can be difficult/uncomfortable to say \u201cok see ya later\u201d when it\u2019s time for pizza. And everyone else is like \u201coh, why don\u2019t you come?\u201d (I am making assumptions here bc this seems like the point of a meetup group.)

What she is saying is that she wants someone else to put the bill for activities and do all of the prep work. Just kick her out of the group. She's already told you that she thinks she should get enjoyment at the direct cost of other people, and they shouldn't bring it up because she should get to enjoy herself for no work or effort or cost at all. Stop playing with her", "nta. electricity costs money, gas for the car costs money. she should just be dropped from the social group because everything costs something.", "NTA  this right here though I have found those loud people never want to step up. \n\nBack when Pokemon go came out local Facebook groups were made and seeing as many 20 and 30 something year olds are Pokemon fans we started organizing meets ups and pub crawls for poke hunting. Lots of mom's were upset because the events were not kid friendly for their kids.

I don't get it.", ">Are you sure she is poor? most poor people try to hide it make excuses why they don't go.\n\nThis, exactly.  I used to be part of a church men's group that did an annual weekend retreat in the spring.  The guys would travel down together and while you had a lot of time on your own, it was also a bonding time for the group.  \n\nThe retreat house suggested around $200 for the amount to cover your weekend stay (two nights of basic lodging, and the meals were family style and very well done).  I didn't have that kind of money so I would always decline the invitation to go.  After about the 9th time of being asked (slight exaggeration), I said the money was a problem for me.  I was told to give what I can and others give more so the retreat house isn't disadvantaged at all.  \n\nThere were two years I attended the retreat and give like $50 or $80.  It was a lot for me at the time.  I took a new job and got a substantial salary increase, and when I attended the retreats after that, I gave the full suggested amount or more.  \n\nThis person clamoring for the free evens is probably just penny pinching.  People who don't have much money usually aren't willing to announce it and you almost have to pry it out of them like the recruiter for our retreat group getting a NO from me multiple times before I told him the reason.", "Honest question - what kind of free events can she schedule? If she has a gathering in a home this type of person will complain that the house is too nice, or in a part of town that is too nice or not nice enough.", "Why would a social group or 50 people cater all their events to this one person?

I'm a big meeetup fan and we had some similar issues in our dining out group. We went to a variety of places and the organizer always reminded people to check out the restaurant and menu online to make sure they'd enjoy it. There were a couple of women who came to every event, but always complained about the prices, often loudly and incessantly while we were all eating. Finally, the organizer just kicked them out and explained that they were making it difficult for anyone else to enjoy the event. \n\nBeing an organizer is hard work! You are clearly NTA.", "It is easier to complain than to organize. But, I am confused is this a group of friends or a meet up (friendly people sharing activities)? Because if is it the latter, don't understand why she is forcing her situation to all the group,  instead of looking for another. \n\nBut I guess, at the end, the better approach is the suggested one \"happy to heard what you want to organize that is free and suitable for the group\" (with a big, big, smile).", "Yeah but she wants it to be both free from personal effort and money.", "NTA\n\nThis kind of stuff is exactly why I stepped down as organizer from my Meetup group.

Not that it really matters, since you ARE making an effort to plan free activities and she's just being a pain in the butt and making everything about her. I was just curious. \n\nIf she did join at random, I'm positive there are similar groups she could join that focus on all activities being free. She didn't have to join yours, and she shouldn't be trying to change things if literally everyone else is happy\n\nDefinitely NTA.

I still think it.", "> Or at least a potluck or picnic, they are eating food they would be eating anyway.\n\nWhy are you pretending I said something I did not?", "Right? If she wants free activities let her organize.\n\nAlso I gotta ask, why does the group have to constantly cater to her? If she can\u2019t afford to do the things the group wants to do than why is she part of it? Why does what everyone else do have to be chosen specifically for her?\n\nWhy are you guys still putting up with this woman? \n\nSorry, times are tough money is tight; I get it. I do, but If you don\u2019t have the money to participate in a group than you leave the group, you don\u2019t just demand they only do things you can do for free.\n\nI also agree with the others here who say she\u2019s fishing for someone to spot her on the money for the other things. \n\nNTA but I really don\u2019t know why you all are putting up with this. It\u2019s not her group, it\u2019s everyone\u2019s group and it\u2019s not on everyone else to cater to her. Plan the activities; if she can afford to participate she can participate, if she can\u2019t she can just not go. it\u2019s not like this is a kids play group you\u2019re all forced to be in, you\u2019re all adults and all get an equal say in what you do.\n\nI\u2019d actually open it up to the other members of the group and see what they think of this. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re not the only who\u2019s getting fed up at constantly having to structure your activities around this one member.\n\nHonestly this woman sounds like a headache.\n\nHey, maybe you can start putting the activities to a vote. Toss out the options- or even better have all the members of the group put in options- and vote on what you\u2019re going to do. DON\u2019T specify it has to be free, just have them put in the suggestions that they want to do.\n\nVote and let the actual group decide what you do.", "This!", "Just checked out that subreddit \ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f\ud83e\udd2f I hate people", "Lol this post kinda reminds me of the NEXT lady from that sub", "I can see asking for some more budget-friendly options, but to expect everything to be free is ridiculous.

It sounds like OP has planned several free activities, and they and the other members of the group are getting frustrated by one vocal member trying to control their plans. A member who frequently does not show up to the free/cheaper activities and does not step up to plan anything for the group.", "Hell, from the looks of it she doesn't even want to show up, just the option of showing up IF she chose to not spend any money on fun stuff... while reaping the benefits of other people's work.\n\nI can't wait to see what free activities that choosing beggar comes up with. My bet is that she won't even do a single on but stay on the outskirts of the group while shit-talking OP and anyone else who doesn't cater to her needs.\n\nIt is best to roll the entitlement right back onto her, if she wants stuff done she can do it herself.\n\nEd. sorry for making this longer but this reminded me of the most obvious choosing beggar story I've seen on TV. A competition where couples could choose out of two date packages if they won a challenge. One of the package was clearly better, included a yacht and jacuzzi and whatnot.\n\nThe guy in the couple that lost went on a long 'confessional' rant about why the winner guy was an asshole for choosing the package \"that he knew I wanted\" - as if the other guy wasn't also entitled to that very same package, he won the challenge so of course winner takes best, that's the whole bloody game. \n\nBut this guy just couldn't get over the fact that he wasn't just automatically given the dream date package that he wanted, with option #2 being a perfectly acceptable bridal suite with jacuzzi, just on dry land.\n\nSome people walk through life and think that they should automatically be given all the cool stuff, and then behave like children when that doesn't happen.", "And foil", "What the heck, is everyone supposed to just bike around with their picnic baskets and coolers strapped to their bikes?
