I didn't buy anything. I walked around and looked at the stuff!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd the bike ride was because we also planned to go out for pizza afterwards. She could have come bike riding with us, and then skipped out on the pizza if she didn't want to spend money.

Did she expect us to sit around in the heat and look at each other?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe wanted me to schedule potlucks, which are fine if people are willing to host -- but potlucks are not free. She was getting on my nerves with her constant reminders to remember to schedule free things because she's poor and can't participate unless it's free.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo one day while she was telling me for the 50 millionth time, I told her that this activity we were doing cost ME about $100. It was a picnic in the park we were having. I bought the ice chest and portable grill so we could have this fun activity, which WAS fun. But it was not free!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo apparently her feelings were hurt because I told her what this activity cost me to set up -- and I didn't mind buying the portable grill and ice chest. I chose to do that. She thought it was inappropriate for me to tell her what I spent for supplies, so that she could enjoy her \"free\" (but not for me) activity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo AITA, first for scheduling activities that could have been free for her but she didn't show up because it wasn't completely free, and for telling her what this so called \"free\" activity had actually cost me to set up?", "created_utc": 1668918161, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzuyiw/aita_for_telling_a_social_group_member_that_the/", "score": 244, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

This person unfortunately seems a little clueless and when you clued her in (which, honestly, I would have given her a reality check too) she couldn\u2019t handle it.

She\u2019s free not to come.", "NTA sounds like what she really wants is to freeload off someone else.", "NTA She is making the group alter its normal activities to suit herself. That is selfish on her part, and then she doesn't even show up. I would continue with the regular activities you normally have and try to please the majority. You might also look for suggestions from the rest of the group for ideas. That would shift some of the responsibilities back onto the group.

Is it really that much of a bother that she asks for free events? Have you had a private chat with her to explain that the group isn't set up to do lots of free events, and that her expectations are not appropriate?

How did you get here?\n\nAll jokes aside, I used to help run a couple social groups and I recently stepped down after a few years, and part of it was due to issues like this- it\u2019s understandable some people can\u2019t afford sushi dinners but if they ignore park walks and demand other people give up their houses to host events- and keep demanding things! Honestly, I was telling people at the end to plan their ideal event if they wanted so bad but so many wanted someone else to do it or it was too hard or they didn\u2019t have a venue. NTA btw", "Are you sure she is poor? most poor people try to hide it make excuses why they don't go. Most people who can afford it but are moochers tell others they are poor. \n\nTalk about it to the rest of the group maybe there is a solution you missed.", "INFO: what\u2019s your club about?", "NTA - sounds like she is in the wrong group. I would advise her this and tell her to search for one that better aligns with her needs. You owe her nothing. She hasn\u2019t offered to help in anyway.", "NTA. And just stop trying to cater to her. At all.", "Ahhhh! The joys of being the person who dedicated their time to getting things done and gets all of the complaints that you aren\u2019t doing it the way people who aren\u2019t putting their time in would do it.\n\nI recommend everytime some gives you a suggestion you respond: \u201cWhat a great idea! Thank you for volunteering to organize that.\u201d", "NTA. She wants to bring up costs but doesn't like when you do? Wow.\n\nI am curious though : does she have a bike? If not, then that wasn't a free activity. If she does, then as you and others have said, she could skip the pizza afterwards.", "I always reiterated that any member can set up and organize an event if they want to.   Like hiking for example, some people wanted to go hiking, but I'm not a hiker and I had no clue where the good hikes were.  But people who ARE into hiking were free to suggest a place and then set up a day and time.  No one ever did.  If you want a hike organized, I'm not your person for that.", "This! There's nothing stopping her from making suggestions herself, at the very least. It sounds like she wants everyone else to do the heavy lifting for her. Definitely she should be asked to give viable suggestions of what would work for her (*and* still be appealing to the rest of the group).", "it's not like we go to ruth's chris steakhouse and get box seats to every sporting event.  Going out to dinner all depends on what you order.  If you order just a salad and a drink, it can cost less.  We did go to the Hibachi one night, that was fun, albeit a little pricey, but I try to schedule things that are affordable for most.   Sometimes we played golf, but it was always on a weeknight at the public course that was about 12 bucks a person including rental of a golf cart for 4.  Not at the expensive country club.", "Asking is one thing.  Constantly reminding me several times a week, including multiple times at each meetup, is not.", "Badgering isn't \"asking\".

I wasn't going to have an event where we just sat in the park looking at each other.", "I would just stick to that as your mantra from now on. \"We always like to have a variety of events, I'm happy that you want to set up some free ones, I can't wait to see what you plan!\" And be super friendly/ cheerful about it. \n\nNTA", "Well look, yeah, that sounds annoying, but have you had a conversation with her about it or did you just explode and make her feel small? In either case, there's no reason to get so angry. Just let it roll off, or ignore her. You're going to make yourself crazy if you let people get under your skin like that.", "Well, that's semantics. But I do agree with the rest of what you said, and I'm sure it's annoying. It just sounds to me like OP allowed themself to get overly angry and snapped at this person without ever having attempted to have a conversation with them first, which in my book, is also bad behavior.", "That WAS our 'conversation\".", "Also, the last time I had tried to \"have a conversation\" with her about the inappropriate thing she had told me at the last event, she replied with \"oh it was SO NICE to SEE you!\" and completely ignored my request, so...", "If you had a private conversation that you didn't describe in your OP, and you explained your position, and told them that they were being a nuisance, and they continued with the behavior, then NTA.

It's ok to clap back at people like this. \n\n\"You've complained every single time, skipped events specially catered to your request and you have yet to suggest/help plan a single free activity yourself.

She's wrong for not showing up for the things that are in her budget. \n\nYou're wrong for reminding her that she's a charity case that others are sacrificing money for. Nobody who's poor wants it bitterly thrown in their face that people resent doing those decent things for them. Also, the have-nots waving bye to the haves halfway through an outing when they depart for more costly pleasures is pretty awkward and depressing. I'd have probably skipped that bike ride, too.", "YTA: Wow... there is NOTHING you are scheduling that is actually free. Yes, a farmer's market costs money- it's in the name: MARKET. Why do you think that's a \"free\" activity? Sure, bike riding can be free... but yes, the pizza after is not free. Do something that actually IS free... you could have gone to a park with a grill.", "YTA. She just wants to participate, and you can't seem to get it through your head what free means. The farmer's market makes little sense if you can't spend any money, not even for snacks. \n\n And   \ne bike ride was because we also planned to go out for pizza   \nafterwards. She could have come bike riding with us, and then skipped   \nout on the pizza if she didn't want to spend money.\n\nSo you were excluding her from the social part of the activity, got it.\n\nIs it really hard to schedule one thing a month that doesn't have some kind of cost associated with it? Or at least a potluck or picnic, they are eating food they would be eating anyway. \n\nIs this some kind of social group where poor people aren't allowed to join? Really curious what your logic is here.", "Look to see if there are free museum days. Some museums might have them, but expect a huge crowd when going.", "Nta.

I organized that specifically because she requested it, but I also had to consider the rest of the group and make the activity not suck (we live in a hot climate)", "I was tired of her constant complaining.

I suspect you're a really decent person who also doesn't give herself a pass for it.", "Some museums have free days...book clubs are free. Some places offer free music at public parks.
