How did you get here?\n\nAll jokes aside, I used to help run a couple social groups and I recently stepped down after a few years, and part of it was due to issues like this- it\u2019s understandable some people can\u2019t afford sushi dinners but if they ignore park walks and demand other people give up their houses to host events- and keep demanding things! Honestly, I was telling people at the end to plan their ideal event if they wanted so bad but so many wanted someone else to do it or it was too hard or they didn\u2019t have a venue. NTA btw", "Are you sure she is poor? most poor people try to hide it make excuses why they don't go.

Thank you for volunteering to organize that.\u201d", "NTA. She wants to bring up costs but doesn't like when you do? Wow.\n\nI am curious though : does she have a bike? If not, then that wasn't a free activity.

Going out to dinner all depends on what you order.  If you order just a salad and a drink, it can cost less.

But I do agree with the rest of what you said, and I'm sure it's annoying.

Also, the have-nots waving bye to the haves halfway through an outing when they depart for more costly pleasures is pretty awkward and depressing.

Why do you think that's a \"free\" activity? Sure, bike riding can be free... but yes, the pizza after is not free. Do something that actually IS free... you could have gone to a park with a grill.", "YTA. She just wants to participate, and you can't seem to get it through your head what free means. The farmer's market makes little sense if you can't spend any money, not even for snacks. \n\n And   \ne bike ride was because we also planned to go out for pizza   \nafterwards. She could have come bike riding with us, and then skipped   \nout on the pizza if she didn't want to spend money.\n\nSo you were excluding her from the social part of the activity, got it.\n\nIs it really hard to schedule one thing a month that doesn't have some kind of cost associated with it?

You\u2019ve been more than fair and she didn\u2019t come to the free events you tried to set up.", "NTA. What were her suggestions?", "NTA. Nothing wrong with telling the truth. Are you planning all of the events? If you are, stop. \n\nIf this group is important to the other members they should take turns planning outings.

Suggest that each household take a turn and that you start with Ms. \"I want everything for free\".", "NTA\n\nIf you are going to run groups you have to realize that you can\u2019t accommodate everyone. One of the biggest mistakes you can make is to try to be all things to all people. Some people just won\u2019t be suited for your group and that\u2019s ok. You also have to be willing to ask people to leave the group or ban people from it. I don\u2019t think what she has done warrants banning her from the group up to now - but you do need to put her in her place. You are not Walmart - you are running a meetup group. She is always nagging you and then not showing up when you do something she wants. She seems to be always unhappy and the more you try to do for her the more unhappy she gets. If you continue to let her whims get to you she\u2019ll end up making you discouraged and you\u2019ll quit. \n\nFocus on what activities will be best for the group as a whole. If you don\u2019t want to schedule a pot luck then don\u2019t. She can join another group that does or start her own meetup group.

Tell her you will be happy to consider them once in a while but that the majority of the group wants xyz and if she wants to participate in those fine - but you can\u2019t run a whole group just to accommodate her.

She doesn't belong in your group, sorry. I understand that you belong to that particular group to have fun activities with fun people. Her constant nagging will bring down the whole atmosphere.

Remind her of this every time she brings it up and maybe look for another group to suggest to her that is always free. She should not complain if she cannot contribute ideas and then blow off events that are free. Explaining to her that even a free for her event costs money is a fact and she should be thankful that you were able to spend the money and she was not asked to or required to chip in.", "Good lord, NTA.

Those were lots of fun, but yes, crowded.", "Then feel free to start your own social group where you schedule nothing but absolutely free activities that cost no one anything.

If I can't afford to go to something, I mention it, and don't attend when my finances won't allow me to go. Not the groups problem if I can't afford it. I cant exactly expect them to change or make plans based on my lower income. There is usually something I can do that's planned eventually.", "You sound amazing. I do not have the energy to do that. I think she just isn't going to fit into the group. You tried different activities and she skipped them. If she wants to plan a picnic where she is only responsible for her food or plan an outing to a park or a library, she can do so according to your group rules. She just wants you to pay and pretend you didn't.\n\nOh! Museums have free days if that works and libraries might have free passes. I borrowed a pass to go to a museum and it was good for four or six people. I'm not saying you need to keep trying but just ideas for your group or pass that along to her and wish her well.\n\nEta: I want to point out that hiking isn't necessarily free so I don't know why people keep harping on that. In order to hike, you need adequate equipment like proper shoes, maybe a day pack, etc...\n\nI also window shop all the time so going to a farmer's market and not buying anything is okay by me.

Sometimes the free admission happens once a month.", "I see you've never heard of Tin Foil. Great new invention, very cheap, probably already have some in your larder. Maybe?", "A bike ride without the pizza, a hike, a game day in the park are just a few activities that could be done for free. If you do not want to organize these things, why even be an organizer? And if you cannot accept judgement, why post to this sub? YTA.", "And the extra time and effort to research, schedule, organize, etc. Onus is on her to make suggestions, and schedule free events. You've tried your best to accommodate.", "I like this approach! \n\nWhat I don't understand is why she is on at you about organising free activities when that isn't the focus of your group. Are there not other groups arranging activities that are free? And if not, could she not start organising such a group herself?", "at any rate, feel free to start a social group where you grill only on public park grills lined with tin foil, but someone still has to buy the meat to grill...", "To make tin foil hats?  One of our members was nice enough to host crafting sessions at her house.  That's free.  where was she?", "I addressed the hiking subject already.  Several people suggested hiking, but I'm not a hiker, and I have no clue where the good hikes are in the area, so I suggested people who wanted to hike, plan a hike.  No one did.  \n\nThe bike ride without the pizza would have sucked because it was during the summer in a very hot climate, literally the only person who would have showed up would have been her -- I wouldn't have even wanted to show for that.  \n\nWe did have several picnics in public parks, but those are not \"free\".  So, feel free to start your own social group where you schedule nothing but absolutely free activities.", "\"then have a game day at the park\" great but that's not \"free\" unless you bring no food or drink except water, and that sucks.  Nobody's gonna do that!", "it's a lot more than just setting a date and time.  You have to consider the needs and wants of everybody.  There's no way in  hell anybody else (including myself) would have even shown up, let alone enjoyed themselves, at just a bike ride without going anywhere to refresh afterwards.  It was a hot day!  And we live in a hot climate, so it's hot almost year round.  nobody wants to sweat like pigs with no relief whatsoever afterwards.", "you wrap the grill in foil, to avoid the rust. Seriously?", "\"then have a free picnic afterwards\" picnics aren't \"free\" though."]}
