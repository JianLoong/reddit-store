Since then she has told me \"it's you and me against the world\" and makes sure i feel loved. She's always taught me to be independent and capable because you can't depend on other people (referring to her ex husband/my dad). We have quite a bit of family and friends nearby so we never needed anyone else.\n\nBut a few months ago it seemed like she's going against everything she taught me about relationships bc she went out with this new guy \"Chad\" who looks like an overgrown stupid man child jock who peaked in high school and is super boring as a person. Her friend set her up with Chad and they went out for about 7 months before she introduced him to me. He thought I needed a dad and our family is not whole. He and I have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't need him in our family. My grandmother always said \"If it ain't broke, why fix it\"? This is how I feel about our family: we are not broke and we definitely don't need fixing.\n\nSo last week, Mom came into my room needing to talk. Her exact words were: \"I want to know how you feel about Chad. Be honest since you haven't told me anything related to your feelings about this.\" I told her the truth: I don't like him and never did. I didn't say anything because I figured he'd be gone in less than a month after she introduced me to him. She just nodded along, listened and thanked me for being honest with her. She told me the next day she ended things with Chad and I couldn't be happier. She is back to her old self too.\n\nWe're staying at Grandma's big house during Christmas weekend and shortly after we got there, my aunt, mom's sister, who was already there, said she urgently needed to talk to me privately. She brought me into the guest room she's staying in and hissed, \"I hope you're happy, you broke up your mom's relationship.\" She kept berating me over breaking up their family when Chad was the one who was trying to break up ours. According to her, I'm apparently a selfish brat who couldn't keep her mouth shut and go along with it. I find her arguments ridiculous since Mom doesn't need my permission to date, and she wouldn't have asked me directly how i felt about this Chad character if she didn't want my honest opinion. I'm not her boss. So am i the asshole for being honest with my mom?\n\nEdit: comment i probs shoulda put here:\n\nif he wasn't boring and looked stupid, would i care if he dated mom? if he was cool and a nice person and made an effort to at least try to get along with me and dating my mom, i wouldn't have as much of a problem with him. maybe it would take me some time to get used to it, but i'd at least try.\n\nhe's a real estate rat whose ideas are from the 1800s and thinks my mom is too soft on me and is trying to manipulate her. i met him about two months ago for the first time and he seemed okay at first but everything im interested in he finds stupid and boring and vice versa. he asked my mom why she lets me run around in all black and dyed hair, like why is that his business?", "created_utc": 1671859797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu2qbc/aita_for_giving_my_mom_the_honest_answer_to_a/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
