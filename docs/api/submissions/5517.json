Since then she has told me \"it's you and me against the world\" and makes sure i feel loved. She's always taught me to be independent and capable because you can't depend on other people (referring to her ex husband/my dad). We have quite a bit of family and friends nearby so we never needed anyone else.\n\nBut a few months ago it seemed like she's going against everything she taught me about relationships bc she went out with this new guy \"Chad\" who looks like an overgrown stupid man child jock who peaked in high school and is super boring as a person. Her friend set her up with Chad and they went out for about 7 months before she introduced him to me. He thought I needed a dad and our family is not whole. He and I have absolutely nothing in common, and we don't need him in our family. My grandmother always said \"If it ain't broke, why fix it\"? This is how I feel about our family: we are not broke and we definitely don't need fixing.\n\nSo last week, Mom came into my room needing to talk. Her exact words were: \"I want to know how you feel about Chad. Be honest since you haven't told me anything related to your feelings about this.\" I told her the truth: I don't like him and never did. I didn't say anything because I figured he'd be gone in less than a month after she introduced me to him. She just nodded along, listened and thanked me for being honest with her. She told me the next day she ended things with Chad and I couldn't be happier. She is back to her old self too.\n\nWe're staying at Grandma's big house during Christmas weekend and shortly after we got there, my aunt, mom's sister, who was already there, said she urgently needed to talk to me privately. She brought me into the guest room she's staying in and hissed, \"I hope you're happy, you broke up your mom's relationship.\" She kept berating me over breaking up their family when Chad was the one who was trying to break up ours. According to her, I'm apparently a selfish brat who couldn't keep her mouth shut and go along with it. I find her arguments ridiculous since Mom doesn't need my permission to date, and she wouldn't have asked me directly how i felt about this Chad character if she didn't want my honest opinion. I'm not her boss. So am i the asshole for being honest with my mom?\n\nEdit: comment i probs shoulda put here:\n\nif he wasn't boring and looked stupid, would i care if he dated mom? if he was cool and a nice person and made an effort to at least try to get along with me and dating my mom, i wouldn't have as much of a problem with him. maybe it would take me some time to get used to it, but i'd at least try.\n\nhe's a real estate rat whose ideas are from the 1800s and thinks my mom is too soft on me and is trying to manipulate her. i met him about two months ago for the first time and he seemed okay at first but everything im interested in he finds stupid and boring and vice versa. he asked my mom why she lets me run around in all black and dyed hair, like why is that his business?", "created_utc": 1671859797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zu2qbc/aita_for_giving_my_mom_the_honest_answer_to_a/", "score": 152, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He doesn\u2019t understand that his relationship is with you and that any relationship he has with me will be based on us finding things to like about each other. He thinks he is entitled to parent me, and I am not ok with another parent - but I would be open to someone who wanted to be a person I could grow to trust as a friend or mentor.\u201d\n\nThe fact is \u201cboring\u201d and \u201clooking stupid\u201d don\u2019t matter because your mom disagrees and don\u2019t need to date people you think are good looking - just people who respect your relationship with your mom.", "Ok but listen, you are growing up and you will leave the house leaving your mother behind alone, I think she has the right to have a companion and to feel loved too. You may not like Chad, but will you be open to like someone else? Because it sounded like you just don't want her to date, full stop.", "Nta. Your mum is a big girl who can look after herself. Enlighten her to what her sister is saying though", "NTA \n\n Chad sounds like an AH who doesn't know how to stay in his lane.\n\nTell your mom what Aunt said to you.", "Agree, your mom should know how she treated you.", "lmao my mom is not the person who makes her being a mom her whole ass personality. . . quite the opposite. she has plenty of friends, family, an awesome job, etc that make her happy. after she threw chad's ass out the window, she has told me multiple times she feels complete with me and our extended family/friends who we trust and would never walk out on us, etc. \n\ni asked mom if i was enough for her, was she disappointed bc i'm more alternative, im not girly at all and am in all black with dyed hair, if those were the reasons she didn't find me good enough and wanted someone else, and she shut it down immediately, and told me i was the best thing that ever happened to her, i was more than enough, i will always come first, im beautiful, etc. she doesn't care at all about my appearance as long as i'm comfortable, happy, and know when to dress appropriately (aka not breaking dress code at school, or at future job), and she'd rather i dye my hair than do drugs and skip school at my age.", "my mom says the same thing. she'd be so mad at herself if she made a situation where i felt like i couldn't tell her anything.", "my dad walked out on us when i was like 2. i have zero memories of him and barely know what he looks like, mom donated everything he left behind and threw out all the old pictures of him. i haven't seen him since and my mom refuses to talk about him without throwing at least 3 curse words in front of his name. \n\nsince then it's only been mom and me, and especially after hitting my teen years she told me to make sure i never become dependent on a partner, especially a male one. she made sure i could fend for myself at an early age. she's told me my whole life i need to be independent, i can't depend on anyone but myself, i need to work hard and be successful on my own, \"chicks before dicks\", she didn't want what happened to her/my dad to happen to me. by dating someone else, especially a dick like chad, she's going against what she's drilled into my head.", "You did nothing wrong. However, relying on a person vs having a relationship that is a partnership are two very different things. Be open to her having that. Everyone deserves the life they want, and if that happens for them, have grace and happiness for that person. Also, as we grow, as we age, our ideas and thoughts tend to evolve, not necessarily change. Give yourself and others grace to navigate that evolvement. It really usually is a beautiful thing.", "i won't want to. sex is gross and relationships sound like a lot of work for nothing based on what i've seen. i'd be very happy as a single mom of a cat or two. my cat won't walk out on me and they can't get rid of me bc i'll be the one feeding them.", "thanks, i'll make the correction. i use the word \"cool\" to mean both nice and cool. being a kind human being tops everything. \n\ni don't think i'd ever be truly \"okay\" with the idea of my mom dating at first, but i'd give them a chance if they were a genuinely nice person and bonus, fun to be around. \n\nthanks to chad's stupid comments about my appearance, i asked mom if she was disappointed in me for not being a perfect teenager who has her shit together and that's why she wanted someone else in her life, and she shut it down immediately. she says i'm more than enough for her, she loves me more than anything in the world, and she doesn't care about my appearance as long as i know where it's appropriate to dress a little crazy, etc. my biggest fear ended up being nothing to worry about and she told me if she meets anyone else she's gonna take it slow.", "you sound like an awesome mom and honestly remind me of mine. \n\nmom would KILL me (not literally but she'd be PISSED) if i lied to her. i learned pretty quickly and early it's a baaaaaadddddd idea.", "She needed to know she wasn't crazy, and was running the idea past another very important person in her life. Equally, if you haven't heard from your mum that you ruined it, and all the hearsay is coming from Auntie dear, then you still probably don't know your mum's actual opinion on the matter.", "sex is absolutely disgusting and pointless unless you want a baby which she does not want. please do not make me imagine my mom doing it.", "if im being 100% honest, i was afraid i wasn't good enough for her and that's why she wanted someone else and she told me that's bullshit and i was plenty and more than she ever thought she needed. she's told me she's very happy with just me and she doesn't need anyone else. \n\ni don't think i'd ever be truly \"okay\" with the idea of her dating but i'd be willing to give the person a fair chance if he didn't have his head up his ass like chad did. mom said if she met someone else in a few years, she'd take it really slow and make sure i'm okay with him being her friend early on before going further. and if i get along well with that person and vice versa only then she'd go further.", "bruhh i literally wrote im NOT her boss and she doesn't NEED my permission to date. she asked me how i felt, i answered honestly. whatever she wants to do with that info, is her choice", "How old are you? You sound 12.", "You should not be imagining your mother doing it long enough that it makes you uncomfortable. Acknowledgment that she is a grown adult who might enjoy sex with another grown adult is a prerequisite for being able to judge her boyfriends.", "after she threw chad's ass out the window she told me multiple times she's very happy and comfortable with just me, she loves me more than anything in the world, she didn't know what real love felt like until she gave birth to me and held me for the first time. she's never shown me any upset feelings over chad, so clearly she didn't give a rat's ass about him.", "YTA... You're a massive AH. You wouldn't like any man that came into your mother's life bit one day you'll be gone, and you only want her to yourself until then. \nDid it ever occur to you that she asked what you thought of him because it was serious and she wanted your blessing? \nI guess it didn't. You were too busy thinking about yourself...", "NTA\nI hope you tell your mom how your aunt cornered you to blame you for your mom's love life.", "Your mum is awesome, your aunt not so much. NTA", "NTA Your mum asked for your feelings in a private chat. What she chose to do next was what she thought was best for herself and you. Your Aunt had no right to speak to you. Next time she tries to get you alone refuse and tell her to stay out of your life.", "Nta\n\nShe asked your opinion, you gave it. Different story if she didn't ask, but your opinion, your honest opinion, matters to her, that's why she asked, that's why she acted on it. \n\nShe sounds like a good mother.", "NTA your mom asked your honest opinion and trusted you,it's likely you backed up ger own feelings about Chad especially if he had started being controlling,  you want your mom to date a decent guy amd there is nothing wrong with that", "NTA. Your mom is lonely. That\u2019s just a fact. She loves you and wants to keep you safe, but she also wants an adult relationship, because it\u2019s not fair for her to dump adult problems on a child. \n\nIt might be time to talk to her about the things you want to see in a possible partner for her. Tell her something like, how you want her to have a partner that respects her as an equal, doesn\u2019t try and act like they\u2019re your dad without having first earned your trust and respect by being a consistent person. Tell her how you don\u2019t want somebody who feels a need to impose their values on you or force you to follow some arbitrary sense of tradition that doesn\u2019t fit your lives. \n\nAnd tell your mom you\u2019d like to have some scheduled talks with her about these guys once they start getting serious and being introduced to you. Ask your mom questions like, \u201chow do you feel when he says X Thing to me?\u201d. You\u2019re getting older and you didn\u2019t break up your moms relationship. Your aunt was wrong to put that on you. Your mom asked a question, and you answered it.", "NTA...Mom asked and she seemed to genuinely want to know your feelings on Chad.  It's the other 'hens' in the family that have the issue.", "5", "He doesn\u2019t need to be interesting to you, to be fair. But he should be kind and considerate of your feelings and it sounds was though he wasn\u2019t that. Trying to parent you is a no go.", "Do you see a difference between dating a man and being dependent on one?", "Aw, thank you!! I tell mine constantly that even when the truth is hard, it\u2019s always better than a lie. Let me have it. And sometimes their truth stings lol. But, let me have it!", "Nobody wants to imagine their parents in these situations. That's normal.\n\nSex is a biological/emotional need for the vast majority of adults (asexual people exist). Don't demonize it, or romantic relationships; you might end up very conflicted in the future. \n\nPeople can be in a relationship and still be perfectly independent, have a network of friends, a career and a bunch of cats. These things are not mutually exclusive.", "keep going you\u2019re so close to discovering sex repulsed asexuals", "I know about sex repulsed asexuals seeing as I am one but that doesn't mean I would call sex disgusting and pointless in general. I at least recognise a lot of people enjoy it for reasons beyond reproduction.\n\nWhataboutism is out of control."]}
