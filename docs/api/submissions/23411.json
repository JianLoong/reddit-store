I confronted her about her outburst towards me and the neglect of house chores, but I tried to keep my tone softer than intended, seeing that she looked pretty depressed. During our conversation, I learned that Tristan had been pressuring her to learn cooking from his mother and online to make their dinners more enjoyable. She explained that she was trying, but her busy schedule with work and school made it hard to find time for cooking lessons. Last week, for the first time ever, she attempted to cook something for their weekly dinner (I wasn't at home, so I didn't know), but unfortunately, it ended up burnt and with other mistakes.\r  \n\r  \nShe felt awful about not being able to cook, and after our incident, she felt hurt by Tristan appreciating my food instead of being understanding about her struggles. Taylor mentioned that she wasn't necessarily jealous of me, but she felt like Tristan didn't care about her feelings when he kept complimenting my cooking despite knowing her insecurities on this topic. She apologized for blowing up on me and acknowledged that her actions with neglecting chores just to annoy me were wrong. During our conversation, she mentioned that she finds my food to be smelly, and the kitchen retains the food odor for a long time after cooking. I assured her that I would take measures to minimize the lingering smells by opening windows while cooking and using air fresheners afterward to neutralize any strong odors.\r  \n\r  \nI also offered to teach her a few simple recipes when she has some spare time, hoping it would make her feel better about cooking. I emphasized the importance of cooking for herself and her well-being rather than just for her boyfriend, as her current eating habits weren't healthy for her body. I even offered to show her my meal prep routine, which would allow her to spend less time cooking and still have food ready in the fridge when she gets home. In the end, I believe we are on good terms now. I want to thank everyone for their comments and support throughout this situation.\r  \n", "created_utc": 1690643480, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15cunbb/update_aita_for_feeding_for_my_roommates_hungry/", "score": 89, "replies": ["Are we missing something here?

For the stew you need chopped lamb meat (You can use cow or chicken too but traditionally its lamb), and cooking oil, I usually use one yellow onion, two red peppers, and one tomato, (But I do occasionally change the quantity based on the size of the ingredients) tomato paste and seasonings. (Salt, pepper, and cumin). For the sauce, you need eggplants, milk, butter, flour, and cheese.\r  \n\r  \nFirst, the eggplants are roasted in the oven or on the stove until charred. Once roasted, peel off the skin and chop the eggplants.\r  \n\r  \nIn a pan, heat oil and add flour. Stir them together.\r  \n\r  \nAdd the chopped eggplants to the pan and mash them well.\r  \n\r  \nLower the heat and slowly add milk to the eggplant mixture while stirring constantly.\r  \n\r  \nMix everything thoroughly.\r  \n\r  \nNext, add shredded cheese and turn off the heat. Keep stirring until the cheese is fully incorporated, and the \"be\u011fendi\" is ready.\r  \n\r  \nIn a separate pan, add some oil and heat it up.\r  \n\r  \nOnce the pan is hot, add the meat and cook until it releases and absorbs its juices.\r  \n\r  \nAdd finely chopped onions and peppers to the meat and continue cooking until they are softened.\r  \n\r  \nWhen they are cooked, add tomato paste and mix it in.\r  \n\r  \nAfter the tomato paste, add deseeded and chopped tomatoes to the pan.\r  \n\r  \nAdd around 1.5-2 cups of water, cover the pan, and cook until the meat is fully cooked.\r  \n\r  \nAfter it's cooked, season it with salt, black pepper, and cumin. (If you have tough meat, you can use a pressure cooker to cook it first. You can achieve the same taste by adding the meat broth instead of water while cooking.)\r  \n\r  \nTo serve, place the \"be\u011fendi\" on the serving dish and place the meat on top.
