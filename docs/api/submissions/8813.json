I was supposed to be his best man.\n\nThe wedding was 12+ because they didn't want to have to deal with toddlers and such, which is fair enough. A lot of guests do have young kids though, so they decided to have a venue nearby with a professional sitter if parents wanted to drop kids off there. \n\nMy wife has some injuries that make her slow to respond/understand what others are saying, and she needs help sometimes with her food, I'll cut it up into small pieces. This doesn't mean she's nothing and she's a smart, capable woman. \n\nThey had the rehearsal dinner, at the end, my SIL pulled me aside saying she had to discuss something with me. She said they told us about the additional venue they'll be having for their wedding, I said yes, then she asked if my wife had any particular food preferences, and they would order extra food for her there. \n\nI was extremely confused and told her we already gave our meal choices, but she said my wife would be better suited at the second venue. I remember just sort of staring at her for a bit and asking if she was serious, that she expected my wife to be with the babysitter.\n\nSIL said it's not like that and they're just looking out for my wife, and I don't have to \"feed her or anything\" and can \"have fun at the wedding\". \n\nMy brother came over and I told him I've literally never heard such shit, that they think my wife is a child to left with a sitter. Brother said it's for the best and if I want I can always \"go over and check on her\".\n\nI told him if this is the way they're treating my wife, I have no desire to be part of their shitshow and dropped out as best man. \n\nWell, all hell broke loose and some people agreed I was right, but my parents texted, called, everything saying they don't agree with this either but it's their choice, and to get over my ego and come. \n\nI didn't end up going. \n\nI did hear they got one of the groomsmen to give a speech and overall it was fine, but my brother sent me a text saying he expected better from me. I replied back saying I expected better from him. My SIL sent a long ass text that I ruined their big day on purpose and made them look bad.", "created_utc": 1675219047, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10qi8wh/aita_for_dropping_out_as_my_brothers_best_man_a/", "score": 412, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Where they are wrong is that you didn\u2019t have a choice whether to go along with it.\n\nThe correct answer to your new SIL is that you did. It ruin her wedding.

That\u2019s your WIFE, and it\u2019s not like she\u2019s going to be running around like a child hiding under tables and knocking stuff over. She just needs a little extra help from you.

Your wife is not a child! What did they expect you to do? They are ablist AHs and so is everyone who agrees with them.\n\nETA: Your parents are also AHs even if they \"didn't agree with it\" but expected you to do it anyway. Can they try to imagine for just one second how sad this would have made your wife? Being treated like a nuisance, like a child, like a 2nd class citizen? Your SIL's attempt to pass off the babysitter as a \"2nd venue\" is also SO disingenuous. She knew EXACTLY how heinous what she was asking for was and was trying to lower her guilt by making it sound more palatable somehow.

They are terrible and I wouldn\u2019t blame you if you cut off contact after this.", "\"made them look bad\"? Oh good, so every one of their friends and relatives know what they did and why you and your wife weren't there.

So on the day your SIL and Brother are pledging in sickness and in health they want to treat your disabled wife in that manner? Next time someone texts you or tells you that you were wrong just remind them that SIL and Brother have now set the precedent on how they should be treated if they should become disabled. Let your parents know that if they feel this is something you shouldn't stand up for then when their time comes to be disabled you will not stand up for them. It is easy for everyone to tell you to put it aside because they aren't the ones who are being mistreated. Remind them that this is your wife that you made a vow to on your wedding day.

And at the rehearsal dinner\u2026 I would say NTA, at all, but something really doesn\u2019t add up here as you\u2019ve told the story.", "I am so sick of hearing people being so picky about who comes to their weddings! My sister in law (I\u2019m married to her brother) didn\u2019t want her two (blood) nephews at her wedding because *she wanted us to enjoy ourselves and not worry about our kids*. I put up a fight over that one. I said, first of all the entire family is at the wedding there are no trusted babysitters left to watch them and second these are your blood nephews?? Third of all, you want us to fully be absorbed into what the new married couple is doing? You\u2019re not even going to notice we are there you\u2019ll be focused on each other! That\u2019s what this reminds me of. They want you to *enjoy the wedding* and not be bothered by your disabled wife so you can fully cater to *them*. Ugh that mentality totally pisses me off! Good on you for standing up for your wife! Couples getting married these days aren\u2019t just bridezillas they are becoming just monsters who overthink EVERY THING! It\u2019s sickening.
