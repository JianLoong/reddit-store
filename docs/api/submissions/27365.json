This situation sounds complicated. I had girlfriend in highschool whose brother had more needs and received more attention as a result, and although she was understanding and loved him and they were close in age, it does have a negative impact on children that follows them into adulthood.\n\nSome children have more needs than others that demand a lot of time from parents, but I think there is a way to balance it\u2026 I\u2019m sorry your mom didn\u2019t do that very well.\n\nEdit: I also am not sure if blaming your sister is the right move here. It isn\u2019t her fault either, and she probably has some guilt over all of this. Children with higher needs are not burdens.", "NTA\n\nYou would've been 13 when your sister started to attend the new school.  Perhaps your mom thought that as you were older you didn't need her as much.\n\nIs this your biological sister, or just adopted sister because if she's biological then your mom may have felt guilty in that she didn't get her earlier because things would've been different.\n\nThe fact remains that your mom spent all her time on your younger sibling and you have every right to feel the way you do because it was what you experienced.\n\nYour mom probably thought she was doing the right thing by your sister but neglected to see how it would affect the others in the house.\n\nShe was likely already having issues with your dad in their relationship and focused on your sister because she was helping her and it took her mind off your dad.  Or it fell apart after your mom insisted on sending your sister to this particular school because essentially no one in the family, other than your sister, actually saw much of her.\n\nEven though you were older, you still needed your mom.\n\nThere's a lot of hurt to get over.  It will take time.  Your mom may have realised what has happened but she doesn't get to tell you how you feel.\n\nTherapy will be helpful.  Both for you and your mom singularly and also together.\n\nWhat's her special needs?

But, sometimes can't really help when there's a special needs child OP.\n\nFrom your responses, I feel you're looking at public school option for your sister from your dad's perspective. And maybe thinking on the lines of \"If only she was sent to a normal public school, mom neednt have taken part time job to private school fees, parents wouldn't have drifted apart and resulted in divorce\". \n\nBut OP, public school isn't that great when there is a child with special needs. Often it is overwhelming for teachers to pay individual attention to students. Regular kids can actually get by later on. Not special needs kids.  They need extra help with everything..\n\nI know you needed your mother equally and you're not wrong for feeling this way. Your feelings are valid. But still your mom tried her best.. She did what she could do then. \n\nYour parents together adopted you first and then your sister right? Then your dad too had responsibilities towards your sister. Since he didn't do his share, your mom had to take it upon herself. If your dad had chipped in his bit, you would've seen your mom way more, got her time too. Think about it.\n\n\nEdit: With OP stating that dad was never on board in adopting the sister and mom never worked prior, it changes everything. Like u/cat-lover76 highlighted, dad knew that they weren't in position to raise this child.\nSo basically OP's mom chose to make the decision. That decision came with a consequence. She is AH for neglecting existing kids. I'm sorry OP. I change my verdict to NTA.", "NTA\n\nYour mother made choices. Those choices destroyed your family. Those choices led you to picking your dad. \n\nYour mother tried her best, for your sister. She didn't try her best for you, your dad or your family. \n\nIf your mother now has regrets about things, that is her problem. You didn't matter to her as a child, why do you matter to her as an adult?", "NAH - this is a very sad situation and I hope you all work this out. Seek therapy.", "[deleted]", "NAH. I know you are hurting, and you have the right to share that. I\u2019d like to share with you what I read in your post as someone from the outside:\n\nWhen your sister joined the family, your mom worked hard to find her the help she needed. Her schedule went from a SAHM with free time to that of a working mother. Leaving earlier in the morning, and coming home between 5-6:30pm. She was still there to wake you in the morning and cook dinner in the evening, and to manage the bedtime routine for you and your siblings. You were 11 years old at the time, so used to having your mom around more than she was then.\n\nYour dad resented your sister. He and your mom disagreed on her schooling. Your parents had other issues in their marriage as well.\n\nFrom your own description, it sounds like your mom tried her hardest to support all of her kids. It\u2019s hard to know whether public school would have been ok for your sister, but it\u2019s highly likely that had she not been adopted by your parents she would have had a worse outcome. You didn\u2019t mention other family members offering to adopt her, and it can be hard to find a good home for special needs kids.\n\nI hope you\u2019re able to reconcile with your mom.", "YTA.\n\nThis is going to be an unpopular opinion, I can already tell.\n\nYou are not an a\\*hole for sharing your feelings. And I genuinely feel sorry for you. Clearly you wanted more of your mom, and you aren't wrong for that.\n\nBut for what you said? You're an a\\*hole for that and how little you value your mom's efforts for you - yes, FOR you because who was feeding you, picking you up, tucking you in at night but mom.\n\nOh, oh no! Not a BABYSITTER!  I'm curious, where was your dad in all of this? Why is it JUST your mom's responsibility to get you to and fro, get you fed and get you in bed? And don't try with the \"dad had to work.\" Dad had time to cheat and apparently to win your affection, so he had time to throw a little Hamburger Helper on the stove.\n\nDoes it not seem weird to you that your dad **never** contributed to taking care of your sister?\n\nYour mom, your dad. They ARE both EQUALLY her parents. That means:\n\n\\- He could have dropped her off at school. He could have dropped YOU off at school\n\n\\- He could have made dinner\n\n\\- He never paid for her school. And don't give me that \"because he thought public school was good enough.\" I've taught in special ed programs in public school. They group most of the kids in there together, regardless of their need. So, special needs students who are extremely violent can end up with passive, etc. I saw more kids get thrown onto mats than I ever care to see, thinks.\n\nAlso, what kind of parent punishes their child for something their spouse did? Your dad refused to contribute to your sister's education because he didn't like the decision. You know what that does? Even if your mom could pay for it, it tells your sister that her dad won't support her getting something that is not just arguably but proven to be better for students with her special needs, just because the other choice is 'fine.'", "YTA\nYou\u2019re leaving a lot out aren\u2019t you?  Your sister is your mother\u2019s actual blood family - her cousin\u2019s child.  Was the child removed from home because of neglect?  Did your mother give your father the ultimatum because otherwise she would\u2019ve gone into the system?\n\nI am skeptical any adoption would have gone through if your Dad wasn\u2019t 100% on board with it  or if your mom chose to divorce him because of the adoption in the middle of the adopting process\u2026  unless it was because this was family and they were trying to place the child with relatives before foster care.\n\nA regular private school isn\u2019t going to turn someone who is soiling themselves into a functioning adult. They would be able to catch up a pupil who is years below her grade level up because of a higher staff to pupil ratio.  Public schools don\u2019t have that luxury.  So you and your Dad are both assholes, but more so your father who as an adult has a better understanding of the situation and for obviously feeding you his viewpoint and turning you against your mom.\n\nIt sounds like your mom saved your sister from an abusive situation and really turned her life around.\n\nHow unfortunate you can\u2019t be proud of your mom.", "Your dad set a bad example for you about a family in need and you are following in his footsteps. Pray you will never be in need because he won't be there for you and you are lc with your mom.", "Feels like there\u2019s some critical **INFO** missing from the story.

In theory as you get older you could learn to understand them and that your sister needed extra support. \n\nI get your feelings but I don\u2019t see the benefit of making your mom feel bad. Especially when you ended it with hanging up and saying you still weren\u2019t good enough.

I would be very interested in knowing how your Dad measured the caliber of the public school versus your Mom's evaluation.

Your Mom may have failed at created a better balance, and you can be angry about that. A fast and convenient answer to this issue would have been nice,  but not all problems can be solved that way.
