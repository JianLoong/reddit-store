So I took it upon myself and became her fairy godmother and took her shopping for a dress and lied to her dad about her just having a plain sleeping over with me, when I actually took her to the prom with her friends and let her and her friends have a slumber party in my living room afterwards ( no boys were there).  \n\nThe night was a success until my niece was tagged in a prom photo on Facebook and my brother got furious and told me I\u2019m poisoning his daughter\u2019s mind and I disrespected him as a parent and that I\u2019m an asshole..so I feel like I maybe be the asshole for lying to him, but my niece Is also an adult so AITA?

Legal adult. Your brother can call CPS... oh wait, no he can't, because she's legally an adult. \n\nThe second she became an adult, you were allowed to take her to anything she wanted to go to. Your brother is a massive AH for still trying to control her, but that's what religious zealots do. JW I'm guessing?\n\nNTA. You're a good aunt. Hopefully she'll strike out on her own too and if she does, she'll have you for support. Good on you.", "NTA. You're the coolest aunt ever.", "How does your brother know about Facebook & how to see tagged imagesif his religious beliefs keep him out of the world?", "NTA she's 18 you only lied because he forbade an adult from doing what they wanting to do thus interfering with free will. Let him be mad", "NTA. She's 18. Hopefully she's saving money to get the hell out.", "NTA\n\n> (F**18**)", "NTA - She's 18, a legal adult now, and she can make whatever decisions she wants to regarding things like this. You're far from TA, you gave your niece a memorable night that she will most likely cherish for the rest of her life, and you let her know that you are someone she can confide in and look to.", "NTA. your niece is being raised in an environment that erases her choice and autonomy and you obviously have experience with that and know how harmful it is. it\u2019s no different than offering any kind of liberation from an oppressive situation. \n\nmy biggest concern though, not knowing the details, is how that could put your niece in an unsafe position with her father, or make things more difficult (i.e. her parents not letting you be around her anymore).", "NTA, not because what you did was right, but because what you did wasn't asshole material. It was however probably not very smart and affected your nieces home life until she can move out.", "NTA\n\nAvoiding the world is more than just a religion- it\u2019s a straight-up cult & a dangerous one at that.

You're an awesome aunt and if you can, you may want to consider letting her move in with you at least until she goes to college because you better believe that if she goes back home your brother is going to make her life a living he11 even more than it probably already is. Hang in there the both of you.", "That religion needs to end. It's dangerous. \n\nNTA.", "NTA and since your niece is 18, you could also help her escape this lousy excuse for a life if she wants to leave. Have you asked her if she wants to go to college or move out?", "NTA, what\u2019s he gonna do? Ground her from going places, not like she can go to them anyway\ud83d\udc80\ud83d\ude02 sorry just a tad joke.

Good job.", "NTA bc she\u2019s 18. I hope she\u2019s able to move out soon. You\u2019re a good Aunt and she\u2019s lucky to have one same family member.", "soft YTA. While she is 18 and is an adult, she lives at home and depends on her parents for the support. So while you not an A for taking her to the prom ( she is an adult) YTA for not considering what will happen to her after you did so. If her parents kick her out, are you able to support her? Also given that you lied to your brother and clearly sabotage his relationship with his daughter, I assume you OK with your relationship with him being ruined", "YTA not only did you disrespect your brother's rules and boundaries as a parent, but you encouraged your niece to be deceitful. Even though she's 18 she still has to live with your brother and now she's going to have to suffer whatever consequences he doles out. I get where you are coming from but it seems like all you accomplished was creating a lot of drama for your niece and for your family.", "YTA and I\u2019m surprised that you are so upset about your brothers response. You\u2019ve broken your trust with him and also helped break the trust between him and his daughter. \n\nEveryone keeps saying she\u2019s 18\u2026 but if we are saying you\u2019re not the asshole because she\u2019s 18, then she should have taken full initiative and responsibility for this, not you. \n\nIt makes a lot more sense for you to be honest with your brother and make it clear to everyone that you are a safe place for any family to stay, especially if they are considering their options theologically speaking. One thing to keep your door open to family, another thing entirely to completely lie and justify it bc you don\u2019t agree with  your family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You gave your niece a wonderful evening where she got to have something like a normal social life, wear a pretty dress, dance, and enjoy herself with her friends. How terrible! (NOT)\n\nI have a feeling the conflict with your brother will continue because she's a young adult now and it sounds like she's miserable in this religion and probably wants out (rightfully so!) You've escaped your upbringing and found greater freedom and happiness outside of the religion and she probably sees you as a role model in that. Of course your brother will see that as \"poisoning her mind.\" I see it as you helping her cleanse herself from the poison that his religion put there.\n\nYour niece's mental health, adult development, and happiness are more important than your brother's patriarchal control over her. Of course you know that, because you've been there yourself. Your lie was for the greater good.", "The kid's 18 so too bad for him, she's an adult and can make her own choices.

Please consider telling her that you want her to live with you so she can go to college and lead a more normal life.

You've not poisoned your niece's mind...his fundamentalism has.  It's put a chokehold on her individuality, fomented rebellion in her soul, and may result in her total alienation from the clan.  His choice to indoctrinate her is at fault, not your help in allowing her to feel normal.\n\nAlso, she's legally an adult so it's got nothing to do with him.\n\nHave you considered if it's wise to remain in contact with him?  I know how hard it is to cut off family, but toxic is as toxic does.  In time one learns to live with the loss of people as if they're actually gone.

It's a cult, cult, cult.", "The only difference between a cult and a religion is the number of followers so... yes.", "Yes, but until they can make that happen, she should help with the FB settings. That can happen in 5 minutes the next time they talk, getting the niece out will take longer."]}
