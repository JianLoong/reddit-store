Would Mimi or something like that be acceptable? It just seems like there's got to be some easy compromise here.", "NAH - ish. \n\nI think its understandable that a 38 year old woman would not connect with the idea of being \"grandma\" and that a traditional grandma name might not be a fit. \n\nI think its also understandable that you don't want your child calling her Aunt or Mama [first name]. \n\nPerhaps you two need to sit down and find something that works for the two of you. I have friends who call their grandmothers, Mimi, Lola, Gigi, heck -- Kris Kardashian gets called Lovey. \n\nAll of this is to say, you two need to find a middle ground that feels comfortable for all parties.", "I'm going NAH yet. In the end, your kid is going to call her what they want. You can't force your mom to use Grandma. And she can't force you to use Mama or Aunt. You'll just need to keep talking till you settle on a moniker that works for you both.", "NAH - she obviously had you extremely young, and it was likely very intense. These different milestones like becoming a grandmother are going to effect her differently than most. You are also doing something extremely common in wanting your children to call their grandma an appropriate name. No one is super out of line here, and this is a normal conversation you might have based on the circumstances.", "NTA. My grandmother had me use her first name for the same reason and I hate her for it. She was basically forcing me to admit I was a mistake. Your child isn't responsible for your mother's insecurities.", "NAH. I can understand not wanting your child to call her Mama X or Aunt because those titles are not accurate to her position. I also think you shouldn\u2019t force a name on your mother that she doesn\u2018t want. Can\u2018t your child just call her by her first name?", "NAH, but what about a name like Mimi or something? I know plenty use that as \"grandma\" instead. \n\nI'm guessing \"mama granny\" is not gonna cut it?", "My Nana was 39 when I was born and she chose 'nana' as she felt 'grandma' or 'granny' were too old sounding. Personally I wouldn't want to go with 'aunt' or 'mama whatever' either as I think it blurs the lines a bit. NAH, something will eventually stick.", "NAH\n\nThere are tons of honorific names she can use instead of grandma. Gigi, nana, granna, etc... Just pick one she likes.", "NAH at this point, but you could slip into that category if you want to push too hard.\n\nWhat difference does it really make? Is this a hill worth dying on?", "NTA, but if she doesn't feel comfortable, don't force her. I'm sure giving birth so young had a lot of impact on her perception of time and a lot of things", "NAH\n\nYour mom will probably take whatever name your kid gives her. It would be nice to try to honor what your mom is asking, but she will see that kids come up with their own names for people, too. As long as she doesn't push the issue with your kid, no biggie.", "NAH. You can call her what you want. She doesn't have to answer to it. Most kids tend to call their grandparents something of their own choosing anyway. Would nana be more pleasing to her? It's still a grandparent name without being overly old sounding.", "NAH.\n\nMy brother married into a Greek family, so our mom was Grandma and SIL's mom was Yaya.  As far as I know, everybody else was just Grandma and Grandpa.  That's what the kids called them to their face and then we used last names to distinguish between them when needed. Then my mother remarried and took her husband's name, and we switched to Grandma (first name).\n\n\"Aunt\" is certainly out.  Mama would be OK if no one uses that to mean \"mom.\"   My personal favorite would be Sheldon Cooper's  \"Memaw.\"\n\nI 100% agree that you shouldn't \"push\" her to accept any name.  There's no point at this time.  When your child becomes verbal is soon enough, and you can let the dynamic work itself out.

Something to think about, my mom took on a grandmother role in one of my friends kids, her name is Diana.

Your child your choice.", "NAH\n\nI have an aunt who was a grandma at 30. Both she and her daughter had their first child at 15.  She definitely is not a grandma,  so they call her BeBe. (Her first name starts with a B and it's common on that side of the family to use first initials as nicknames Bee,  Kay,  Jay,  etc.)\n\nThis is one of those compromises you need to make. And be careful lettng the kids pick the name, my grandma's mom was Dodo,  courtesy of her eldest grandson.", "just think of some other names. My grandma\u2019s were Mimi, Nana, my friends had a Yiayia, there\u2019s plenty of options that aren\u2019t grandma or aunt that still imply grandmother", "NAH. It sounds like she's really insecure about this, so I don't think you have to push it. You don't have to lie on any legal document and classify her as an aunt when she's not, she's just asking that the kids don't call her \"Grandma.\" There are one thousand different things the kids could call her that are still a special nickname for their grandmother, one that does not make her feel old or insecure.", "I feel your pain, my Mother did this to me and she was 19 years older, she told me she was too young to be called a grandma. So, for me, you are NTA. I let my kids choose and they all called her grandma despite her trying to come up with these other names and not one of them stuck. Ever. She would try and correct them, and, in the end, she is Grandma, and their other grandmother is Granny. So, believe me, she will be alright.", "I am going to go against the majority it seems. NTA. She is requesting to be called Mama, really. She is not this child's mama. If she does not want to be called \"Grandma\" that is fine, but to try to paint herself as the same as a parent to this child is absolutely overstepping. \n\nLet her know that your child will call her by her first name, but she cannot make a big deal out of it later when she decides she wants the honorific. One of my uncles married when I was a teenage. She made it clear she did not want to be called \"Aunt first name\" because she was \"too young\" to have nieces and nephews our age. 20 years later, she is a little disappointed that we use her first name, but that was her choice.", "NTA she may be young but she\u2019s still a grandma. I\u2019m Mimi so there are lots of variations to use. A lot of people use grandma in different languages. Would not let her be called any variation of mom because that\u2019s just a little off.", "NTA but your mom is. Momma (insert her name)? Talk about confusing for a kid.", "NTA: Your baby absolutely should not call your mother Mama or Aunt. That's not what she is. It's best to settle this now instead of when the baby starts talking. She can pick a name that's not specifically a \"grandma\" name like Gigi or or Mimi or something like that but it's not being an AH to insist that your child call her something other than something she's not. Your child is going to know, growing up, that your mom is her grandma and it's weird to say \"well, but you have to call her Auntie\" or something like that.", "YTA. Your mom gets to decide what she doesn't want to be called.", "NTA- You are that child's mother. She should not get the title of mama just because she had you young. My grandpa did the same thing with his first grandchilden and it was weird. Maybe you two can think of a more neutral name. Like MiMi or Gigi", "NTA. Could you find a compromise with something like HoneyMa or Nana?", "NTA. It's creepy AF that she wants to be referred to as Mama anything, she is *not* the Mama. Aunt would also be a lie. I can sort of understand her being perturbed at being referred to as a grandma at 38, but whose fault is that? Hers, & she doesn't get to take it out on you or your child. I guess a possible compromise would be your kid calling her by her first name only, since Grandma doesn't want to be grandma & anything else would be a lie. It might sound a bit disrespectful, but what choice is she leaving you?", "She doesn\u2019t get to be mama anything to your child just because she is embarrassed that she was a teen mom.\n\nNTA", "NAH\n\nOOH, your mom has every right to not want to be called Grandma although the whole 'embarrassing' thing is not something I understand. Shit happens, why be embarrassed about it? Anyone wants to comment about it, it's them that need to be embarrassed, not anyone who is just trying to live their lives the best they can.\n\nOTOH, I understand your discomfort with having your child call your mom by something that suggests they have a different familial relationship. \n\nOn the gripping hand, I think your mom might be underestimating the damage that might be done to your child if they start thinking at some point that your mother didn't want to acknowledge them as their grandchild. \n\nMaybe find a word that can imply the love between a child and their grandparent in a different language as a compromise.\n\nI also have to ask is your mom going to deny that your child is their grandchild if asked or pretend that it's their child/nibling/random child they're babysitting? That's not going to be healthy in the long term. And what happens if in 10 years or so your mom decides that being called Grandma is okay for your future kids? How is that going to feel to this one?", "My sister was 38 when her grandson was born. She has always been Nana, even then. Perhaps your Mom will accept another type of nickname. Maybe a variation of her 1st name.", "NTA- my mom did the same thing. She\u2019s in her 60\u2019s but wanted to have my son (8months) call her mama. Now she goes by Gammy or grammy idk which she flip flops them.", "NTA...she wants to be called mama? That doesn't even make sense to me considering that's easier for most little ones to say vs mom so what would your own child call you? \n\nCouldn't she go by \"gigi\" or another cute grandma nickname? \n\nOne of my friends was a grandma by the time she was 36 because she had her first at 16 and I don't remember her having an issue being called grandma and she also had a 3 year old at the time. I'm not sure your mom's the asshole either but she's certainly being difficult.", "NAH. Why can't you just use her first name?", "NAH - I kind of get your mom's POV. She feels too young to be a grandmother just like she was too young when she had you. And it's weird when you get to your thirties and realize you are getting old but don't actually want to admit it yet. Maybe try for an alternative nickname like Gigi for \"grandma\". It doesn't necessarily announce to everyone that she's a grandma, but  still has a grandparent ring to it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Second, it\u2019s kinda unusual that she doesn\u2019t want to embrace being a grandmother and would rather take on the \u201caunt\u201d role. And it\u2019s appalling to me that she wants a \u201cMama\u201d title. \u201cMama [name]\u201d is just wrong. You are your child\u2019s mother. She\u2019s the grandmother. She\u2019s not even the child\u2019s step mother so to have a mama title is just odd and unnecessary and overstepping your role as your child\u2019s mother. \n\nBut, I can understand where she\u2019s coming from. It seems to bother her that she\u2019s very young and the age gap between you and her is narrow. It\u2019s certainly rare. So, she\u2019s sensitive about it. Understandable. Her feelings should be respected and taken into consideration. \n\nI think there is room to compromise here though. There\u2019s a lot of grandparent names out there from different cultures.

While none of them feel ashamed of their kids or grandkids, they really aren't in for the additional judgement for having had kids young, and now their kids are having kids young too.\n\nAnyway, there's lots of alternative names your mom could use that are more discreet than Grandma - without being flat out inaccurate (like \"Aunt\"): Mimi, Memee, if she's game for it \"Big Mama\".
