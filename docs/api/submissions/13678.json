Glad u are ok and dump him", "NTA\n\nIt's your inheritance. I can understand he might be disappointed that you're no longer willing to help him, but it wasn't his money to invest in the first place. What happens if you did give him the money and his business was shit? That's a loss for you. If it went the other way, cool, I'm sure he'd give it back, but there's no guarantee in that. \n\nFrom reading your post and some further info in the comments, I've come to the conclusion that you deserve better.

It\u2019s time to accept some hard truths. He doesn\u2019t love you, he just wants your money. Silver lining, you haven\u2019t married him or given him money and time you\u2019ll never get back.

It would've been in his best interest to be caring and kind, but he's too self-absorbed to even PRETEND to care. \n\nNow do yourself a favor and cut him loose.

It just sounds like he\u2019s using you and trying to make you feel guilty for not helping him out (by giving him money)\nHe\u2019s a grown man and should be able to fend for himself. OP please don\u2019t waste your inheritance on someone who doesn\u2019t care about your health and wellbeing.", "Do not go through life with someone dragging you down. No amount will be enough for someone who feels they are the victim and they are deserving of someone elses money. Use your money wisely, invest and save, or you WILL regret it.", "I stand with NTA. I feel like saying something more but it's hard to judge without really knowing a lot about the relationship you have, but the way he was cold and careless about you being at the hospital and only cared about losing your financial help sends me a red flag that he might be using you. I think you should stick with your decision of not giving him money and see how it goes, if he breaks up with you or something then you dodged a bullet, if the relationship continues in a healthy way, then maybe you can leave money out of the equation or decide if you want to offer to help again.", "That is after you got mad and told him you won't help him. \n\nI mean what did he do vs your expectations before that, that made you tell him you wouldn't help him?", "Just curious.", "As in life, there's two sides to the story but I keep coming back to that it's OP inheritance so it ends all conversations no matter if there's more to the story or not. You decide what you want to do with it, who you want to give it to. At face value, your boyfriend feels that they didn't have enough growing up, how it wasn't fair to him (and we don't know what degree that was), and that he was having health situations while you were in the hospital. It's your money, period.", "He was complaining to me how he was feeling sick all day and his arm was hurting and basically rooting the topic of the convo on him..", "OP doesn't have to give him any money at all. And I don't think they should.\n\nBut it matters if OP was for eg holding it over him to enforce an unreasonable expectation. I've seen the AITAs where someone claims their partner is 'neglecting' them by taking 3 hours to respond to a text, or by having to go to work instead of sitting by their sick bed.\n\nIn this case, OP's complaints are valid. But I still don't think that the money should come into an argument about something else. Either you drop the guy who treats you badly, or you work out the issue with him treating you badly, or you just don't give him money at all because the relationship is not in a good place and he's not entitled to it. But 'treat me better or you don't get my money' isn't going to make for a healthy relationship.\n\nThis doesn't make OP an AH at all, but the bigger picture of the story does matter.", "OK, so:\n\n1. You don't have to give him any money. Its yours, he's not entitled to it. In any way. Ever.\n2. He sounds self-centred and he shouldn't be complaining about being sick when you're in hospital, and its terrible he didn't care about your asthma attacks. I get why you're mad at him.\n3. But... when you're upset, talk about the actual issue, don't bring your money into it like a weapon to make him act differently because you're mad about something else.\n\nLike, I get it, why should you help him with this money if he's going to be a selfish AH to you? You shouldn't.\n\nBut either you talk about the actual issue (him being selfish and not caring) and he changes, or you don't stay with someone who treats you badly. But don't stay with someone who treats you badly and then say 'be nicer to me or you don't get my money', cos that's just paying your bf not to be a d!ck to you and who wants a relationship like that?\n\nI think this money would end up being a bigger problem between you if you lend/give it to him, because it wn't make him stop being selfish, and it sounds like you'll use it in future arguments too, any time he does something you don't like. And that will make things worse, it won't solve what you're actually fighting about.", "Mind you, I don\u2019t live with him.", "So absolutely true. The end still states the same financially but on a moral ground it could be another story."]}
