If his new degree in astrophysics doesn't work out, does he get to have a 3rd degree?", "NTA. You paid for a degree for him and let him know that anything else would need him to step up. \n\nI would, however, consider giving him a loan. Documented and official, so that there is no question of it being a gift. To at least save him the cost of the interest. But I would require that he checks his entitlement quickly.", "NTA.

A lot of people can't afford to go to college and most people have to take out loans. He is lucky he got his paid for. \n\nI went to college at 23, and paid for it on my own.

People thought the theater degree was silly until I changed their minds when I showed them how much more useful it is to studying communication and analyze the internal logic of plays. People who had biology or other science degrees had a very hard time adjusting to school based on persuasion instead of giving the right answer. \n\nUnless he's looking for specific skills or certification prep (like a computer science degree), getting a different degree probably won't significantly change his job prospects. It'll just delay his entry in the job market.", "NTA. My husband got 2 degrees.

Here's what I did:  Daughter needed a house; I had the funds.  So I bought the house and immediately changed my will.  Knowing the chances of her ever paying me back were slim and none, the cost of the house is now listed in my will as the amount to be subtracted from her third of my estate when I pass.  Meanwhile, the title remains in my name, and she is responsible for all expenses.  If she misses paying taxes or utilities, that amount gets added to the amount to be subtracted from her inheritance.  To avoid changing my will constantly, I keep the costs for the house on a separate attachment, updated whenever I have to cover an expense to keep the title clear and if she ever makes a payment, I'll subtract that amount from the total.  This way, my other two children are not penalized for living within their means and she ends up with the title after I pass (or she pays me back - lol).", "your son is TAH for majoring in theater!  you paid for him to get a degree and he wasted an opportunity many never get.", "NTA, but you Americans must seriously hate your children. \n\n\"My son is struggling and wants to improve his situation, and I have money to give, but nah.

Due to medical bills, my family couldn't afford to help me with college. I double majored in English and Journalism, and I got an MA in English. When I went back for my terminal degree, I was flat broke. My mom gave me the pile of one dollar bills she'd been saving *since I started college* six years earlier to help me pay for application fees. It was one of the most precious gifts of my life.\n\nYou gave your kid four years to chase his dreams, and he's repaying you with greed, selfishness, and petty cruelty. \n\nYou do not owe him this degree or anything at this point. I'm so sorry he took your gift of undergrad for granted", "  NTA at all first, the fact he called you a jerk or any other name for denying him a second degree is full on entitlement or dare I say \"dramatic\", sure some EU countries offer free Uni but the OP is not a country, just a parent that put 2 kids through college and now wants to be able to have a decent retirement.\n\n  There are plenty of jobs in many fields especially in state and federal level that require a degree, does not matter what degree BUT its like the powers that be are insuring all those that come after them also have to attend a college even if you don't need a degree to do the job at all.  These gated jobs are perfect for those with a theatre degree, fake it until you make it is pretty common and you already have acting skills.\n\n  Also as the son has already got one degree, he could get grants and loans and as long as the school he got his degree isn't a total joke a lot of those credits for the \"core\" classes should carry over into his new degree so he does not have to start back over from Day 1, ,making the cost of the second degree less expensive, especially if he picks a community college.. you know like \"store brand\" school, works almost as good as name brand and makes your budget go farther. \n\n   Once the son has some skin in the game with loans he would do some research and pick a degree that will allow him to pay back his loans while still being an adult and paying his way through life.\n\n  If the son does not want to do loans, work some jobs not related to theater save up and go to some vocational school for refrigeration, heating, plumbing, electrical. A blue collar job normally with a union to help with your employment.  After the first few years in the vocation of his choice he can start taking night and weekend classes as he can afford them if he still has the passion for that second degree, that second degree could now be tied into his vocation such as Electrical Engineering and once he has that degree will be making some good cheddar normally working with the same outfit he was working with as a journey electrician. \n\n  Son doesn't want to do a \"dirty job\" he can also join the military, military is just like the private work force they love them some college educated people as well.  GI Bill I imagine is better with an officer rank.  As long as people in charge stop making these dumb decisions and we can stay out of WW3 should be ok.", "Soft YTA and here's why lol Your son wants to further his education and get a new degree so he can afford to LIVE. You have the money. A lot of people don't. When it comes to education and helping your kids with tuition, I am all for it. If you can prevent him from crippling debt and being able to afford to live, why would you say no? I know relationships are more complex than that and I get it and I know you already paid for his education once but man oh man if I could set up a kid for a better future in some capacity I would do it. Everything is so expensive. I don't know anyone that has just one job. And we all have careers! Because that's what they told us to do. Nurses, teachers, dental assistants...we all are struggling in some way nowadays. I don't think you are REQUIRED to help him. I'm not saying he is entitled to help. I just think it's worth it. I just wouldn't be able to see my son struggle if I knew I could help. That's just my opinion. A lot of parents are of the mindset \"life is a struggle and you'll learn from this and blah blah blah\" and we are...we have. If you can make your kids life easier, why wouldn't you? Some parents would rather see their kids starve than help them out because \"nothing in life is free\" and that's another reason why most of us millennials are in therapy.

Anything else is on his.  GI Bill helped me get my Bachelors.  My Masters was all on me.", "Definitely NTA. You\u2019ve given your son more than most parents are able to by simply paying for his degree. On top of that, you gave him fair warning that you would only be doing it the one time around and anything further he would be responsible for.\n\nYou have no obligation, moral or otherwise, to pay for yet another degree.

I think that it's great that you were able to help your son out by paying for his degree. That's fantastic, and very generous of you.", "NTA - He needs to understand that as an adult his quality of life is on him. If you make it your responsibility he will never grow up.", "What? NTA. Your child is not entitled to anything. Theatre was a rough choice and now he's having a bad go of things. He needs to figure it out and this process of figuring it out is part of his schooling. He's not entitled to your money. \n\nIF you REALLY want to, he could always go to school, take out the loans, and feel the pressure to succeed on his own - then if you see fit, gift him the cost of the education and pay off the loans.

From a very early age, I was 100% convinced that was going to be my life's work. My dad wasn't initially thrilled, but he was absolutely supportive, emotionally and financially.

Finding a job that paid the bills during the day so that I could work in the theatre at night. \n\nI figured out what skills I had, got a job that utilized those skills.
