Splitting the day into two different celebrations just seems like a lot and it's not very realistic imo. And requiring everyone in your family only come to your house for Christmas is ridiculous, it's very normal to alternate who hosts for holidays especially if you have two sides of the family in different areas or something. You can always do your own celebration at home every year, but it's not fair to demand everyone only celebrate Christmas at your house. The pie thing just seems a little weird, why not have pie and cake? If it's a cost thing it sounds like people would be more than willing to bring pie for the Christmas portion of the celebration.

My mom even told me growing up that she wouldn\u2019t throw me birthday parties because no one would show up or bring gifts.

So, I have a rule that all Christmas dinners must be at mine and my husband\u2019s house to celebrate my kiddos. Also, Christmas celebrating must only be done throughout the afternoon and during dinner but then the celebrating that\u2019s done during dessert must be reserved for only birthday party-themed festivities and decorations. Another rule is that nobody is allowed to bring \u201ccombo gifts\u201d like a big gift for Christmas and birthday combined, nor may they give a gift to my kiddos that they have to share. Additionally, no birthday gift can be wrapped in Christmas paper and no Christmas gift may be wrapped in birthday paper. And, same with greeting cards- no one-size-fits-all card or shared cards allowed. The last rule, and the one that is a sore spot for the family, is that there will be no pie at the table as I go all-out on birthday cakes for my kiddos. SIL and especially husband\u2019s elderly aunt ALWAYS break the rules! AITA for enforcing the \u201crules\u201d and asking all the in-laws to comply?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Honestly at that age I often ASKED for combo birthday and Christmas gifts (I\u2019m an autumn baby) so I could get bigger nicer gifts.

Buying gifts is not a necessity and you and your mom should be thankful that your family wants to come over and spend the day with you. I wish you and your sibling a very happy birthday and Merry Christmas.", "I bet your friends would celebrate you either before or after the holiday!  And totally get you want to be celebrated on your actual bday, having cake for dessert (if you want that) Seems totally reasonable.  Does the wrapping paper matter?  Does the actual date matter that much as long as you\u2019re able to celebrate?", "Telling your family where they can have Christmas dinner though is an overstep, SIL is well within her rights to host it at her house and invite her family, OP can just not go.", "It\u2019s not disrespectful to combo a gift. SHE wants, because she never once said the 15 year olds have an issue about any of this, everyone to buy her kids 2 gifts each. That shits expensive, and immediately excludes anyone who can\u2019t afford that.", "That was always my dream. I wanted all the things that came with a warm birthday like swim parties. Friends who weren\u2019t stuck at their family\u2019s house, or in college they were on break. I never quite got my fam to onboard.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

It's really not that unreasonable to ask that you not wrap birthday gifts in Christmas paper and vice versa.", "Inevitably the vast majority of holiday babies end up with feelings of birthday attention and gift unfairness. Maybe there are exceptions when parents make and enforce ridiculous strict rules about gifts. Sure. However, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s worth it. To each their own. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t have given a ruling but I think the sub rules require you to judge in top level comments so that\u2019s the side I fell on. Closer to a YTA than a NAH I think. There are more tasteful and elegant ways to deal with the perceived problems.", "Right?! Come on pie and cake? Thats a win win.", "That\u2019s rough \ud83e\udee4", "I wouldn't be able to, since I wouldn't be able to remember ALL the rules to break each of them.", "But now that you're older, you can do what you like :)  You don't always need to the family round to celebrate something.", "I wouldn't be invited back after I deliberately broke all the rules (but while still giving those children awesome gifts!)"]}
