My oldest daughter (MTF) has recently come out as transgendered. This was not a complete surprise as she has been very feminine for her entire life and both of us are very proud of her for finally coming out. My husband and I both have friends and a brother who is transgender, so when she has a lot of people in her corner who is rooting for her success and helping her with what she needs to live her life the best way possible. \n\nThe issue is that when she was born she was given the same name as my father who passed away a few months prior to her birth. This is a very masculine name, so when she came out she also announced she is going to change her name. I supported her changing her name; however, I asked her if she would be willing to rename to another name of my choice that is similar to her birth name as it was very important to me that she was named after my father. (Think like Carl to Carly). \n\nAfter I asked this she declined and said she wanted to go by a completely different name that has no meaning other than \u201cit sounds pretty.\u201d I asked her if she would legally change her name to Carly, but go by the name she chose in social settings. She said absolutely not. When she said this I left room and began to cry. My husband came after me and tried to calm me down, but soon my daughter came in and started yelling at me. \n\nShe told me I wasn\u2019t be supportive and making her transition all about me and my feelings and that I was no different than parents who don\u2019t support their kids transitions. I told her that was unfair and that I would support her regardless of her decision, but her dead name was very important to me so I would like her to try to find away to keep it. This is when I said something that my husband and eldest son think made me the ass hole: I told her that I gave birth to her and I deserve a say in this part of her life from being her mother. It\u2019s hard to convey the tone I said it, but I can assure the tone was not calm. However, I feel like I am not in the wrong. Her name is so important to me and I think she is being unreasonable but not allowing me to have a say in this part of her life. But now I feel like I\u2019ve been an asshole. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1681264874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12j62yn/aita_for_crying_when_my_daughter_came_out_as/", "score": 129, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I feel for you though. You named your daughter as a way to honor a dead family member, and now that she wants to change it you feel like you're mourning that person all over again. That must be really hard.\n\nBut your daughter is her own person. Most people don't get the opportunity to decide their own name, but she does, and she's probably really looking forward to it.\n\nBy making a fuss about whatever name she chooses you *are* making the situation about you. It is not her job to manage your grief. There are many ways to honor someones memory, please do not put the burden of that on your child. She's going through a difficult time in her life and needs your support more than anything right now.\n\nPut your feelings about the name to the side and apologize to her for what you said. This isn't about you.", "YTA. You did make it all about you and your feelings. There was absolutely no need to have the discussion about her name in that moment. You should have hugged her, told her you support her and are proud of her and that\u2019s it.", "Oh geez.  I understand wanting to commemorate your father and that being important to you, but I think part of what you're missing here is that for your daughter, it's *not* a connection to her grandfather, because she never knew him - it's just the name she grew up with, which for gendered reasons doesn't fit.\n\nFor some people a re-gendered version of their original name is fine, and for some people it's a constant, painful reminder of this person that they aren't.  It sounds as though, for your daughter, it may be the latter.\n\nI'm sorry OP, I'm sure this is bringing up a lot of genuinely painful stuff for you re: your father that really isn't about your daughter, or her gender.  But you *don't* have a right to decide what her name is; the only reason parents get to name their babies is because an infant is too young to have any input, and she's full grown.\n\nI do say this with compassion, because it sounds like your grief for your dad really just blindsided you here, but YTA.  You owe your daughter an apology.", "NAH. You are upset, she is upset. You both need to realise that yelling at each other won't solve any issue. You daughter probably wants to avoid naming herself anything related to her dead name because it might trigger her gender dysphoria. While her dead name was important to you, you need to realise that you can't really force her to listen to you. Maybe try to come up with  a compromise (a middle name maybe) but you don't get to dictate her life. The reason I didn't vote  Y T A is because you are entitled to your feelings. You aren't being unsupportive but you are upset with her name choice, which again is not something you get to decide. She is an adult.", "This sort of thing is why I wouldn't want to name a kid after someone in general. People deserve to be their own person, have their own name. I think realizing this is why my mother didn't care that I changed my name when I transitioned. I was named after her deceased cousin who I could not have been more different than.\n\nI had a friend in college who went through the same thing that is happening between you and your daughter, though her father did not give up on his point. It tore away at their relationship and she went LC. \n\nI think if you want your response to seem a fragment of reasonable to your daughter, you can explain your unresolved grief, but only with an apology.", "YTA \n\n>She told me I wasn\u2019t be supportive and making her transition all about me and my feelings and that I was no different than parents who don\u2019t support their kids transitions\n\nShe's correct.", "NAH maybe an unpopular opinion but this is a tough situation for both of you. The grief a parent can feel when a child comes out as transgendered is so often invalidated and people say crappy things in grief and anger. I think you both said things that hurt the other person. \n\nIf you don\u2019t apologize and then deal with this on your own without burdening her further you would be an asshole though", "NAH. People on the internet want everyone to magically handle huge news with nothing but calm and compassion and selflessness but unfortunately life isn\u2019t always like that. Your daughter was wrong when she said that you\u2019re no different than parents who don\u2019t support their kids\u2019 transition. You\u2019ve already begun referring to her with the correct pronouns and accepted her as her daughter. You\u2019re also grieving the loss of a connection to your dead father. At the end of the day, your grief is about you. You need to find a way to make peace with the fact that what you considered a way to keep your father alive isn\u2019t tenable for your child\u2019s happiness, and keep his memory and spirit and your love for him alive nevertheless \u2764\ufe0f", "YTA you got to choose her name when she was born, now it's her turn no matter what you think.", "Sorry, but you\u2019re way out of line here. Maybe you could change your middle name to this name that is so meaningful to you.", "ESH\n\nYou overstepped when you pushed it but it's fine/understandable that you're upset.\nYour kid needs to have some compassion for you as well. \nIt's a process for everyone...my partner transitioned after we got married. I was happy for them but some shit sucked.", "yta softly.\n\nI get mini panic attacks when i hear words that even remotely rhyme with my deadname. My old name was very rare and I've only met 2 other people with that name. I always tell trans people not to go for the \"opposite gender version\" of their name right away because of this.\n\nEdit: also, at first my mother hated the name i chose despite being supportive otherwise. Now it's been 10 years and she can't imagine me as anything other than what i chose", "NAH - You lost a son, but gained a daughter. You are also grieving that loss of connection to your father. She, on the other hand, is learning to navigate what is clearly an emotional and vulnerable time in her life. I hope you can both see past the pain you are feeling, to see the pain in each other. Having raised two children past their teens, I want to warn you that this may take more time on her side than it does on yours. Good luck to all of you.", "Gently, YTA.\n\nA name is a gift--and like any gift, the recipient is free to do with it what they will. Some people will receive a gift and love it for their whole life; some people will hate it, some will use it to be polite even though they don't really want it, some will give it away or put it on a shelf when they've outgrown it. While the gift you gave may be meaningful and special and deliberately chosen, it no longer belongs to you. You are allowed to have your feelings, but you shouldn't pressure your daughter to change her decision just because you feel a certain way about her old name. She wore that gift for 21 years, and it doesn't fit anymore. Let her take it off and put on what she wants.", "Nah.  Which most people are probably not going to agree with.  This is a big change, and showing some emotion is normal.  But, the name does not hold the significance that it does for you to your child.", "YTA. This isn\u2019t about you so don\u2019t make it about you. If it\u2019s that important, change your own name, Carly.", "NAH\n\nBy your tone, you are sound supportive and were just sentimental over the family name given to your child and your deceased father. I don't think its right they yelled at you when there's children in their situation who are immediately disowned for such a thing, and this is not the case as you all sound like a very loving and inclusive family. \n\nYour child should understand this is a big change for EVERYONE and needs to give the same patience they are receiving. Your reaction to their name was more of a tie to your deceased father and not a dig to your them.", "Your first paragraph is awesome.  It\u2019s the best perspective a parent can have.  For trying to control her decision on name, YTA.  Ultimately, her preference is more important than yours.", "Oof. I\u2019m the mom of a FTM son. When he transitioned and he changed his name legally(for the first time) he masculinized his first and middle names and added his chosen name as a third name, keeping his last name from birth. I asked/suggested this and he went along with it. \n\n4 years later he got married and changed his name again. That time he dropped the masc versions of his birth first and middle names, kept his chosen name, chose a brand new middle name, and adopted his partners last name. \n\nWhen he finalizes his divorce he\u2019s going to drop the old spouse\u2019s last name and choose a new last name, possibly from my families history of names. \n\nIt\u2019s been a complicated time with his names, both keeping track of what\u2019s happening and the legal crap that many name changes brings. All that being said, I got to feel my feelings about his name and all it meant to me, but ultimately it\u2019s his name and I get no say. Even if I did get to name him initially. \n\nYour daughter should not have come in and yelled at you about crying, you definitely should have not yelled back or spoken strongly. This is her future, not yours. You\u2019ll be privileged to maintain a space in her future: don\u2019t F that up over her name. \n\nYTA make this right with her and apologize for speaking so strongly. Maybe talk about your emotions. I\u2019d keep the conversation about your grief for much later down the line. Keep loving her and get out of the way \u2764\ufe0f", "INFO: If this name is so important to you why do you not change your name to a female version of it. Could even be the middle name. This way it still will be honored. \n\nNames of dead relatives only have value to the people who have known this person. Your child has no connection to their dead grand father. Of cause your daughter does not want to keep it. It is your treasure and not hers.\n\nIf you want to honor the name, change your own.", "YTA. I\u2019m a trans man. Do you know how much courage and thinking and fear it takes to come out to a parent? It fucking sucks, and you twisted it and made it about yourself. You are no different than parents who don\u2019t support their kids if you are stuck on that kid\u2019s name. You are being selfish and intolerant.", "YTA.\n\nWanna commemorate your father? Get a tattoo. Sponsor a memorial. Legally change *your name*, but just go by the one you prefer, since you think that\u2019s such a great idea.\n\nThe biggest part of what your daughter is going through is becoming *who she feels she really is*, and it\u2019s not fair of you to try and impose conditions on that.", "Gentle YTA.\n\nIt's okay to be upset that she's changing her name. It was okay to ask that she consider the feminine version of her old name. It wasn't okay to burden your new daughter with those feelings. You're her parent; your grief cannot take precedant over your daughter's vulnerability. You should have taken those feelings to somewhere private instead.", "My favorite analogy about name changes is that when our children are born and we know nothing about them, we give them a name first and foremost. As they grow into themselves, if they find the name no longer fits, they are free to let out go as it was a gift freely given by us without obligation or expectation. Not the AH for your feelings, but holding your pregnancy and labor over your child\u2019s head\u2014as if what you did that they had no say in gives you the right to weigh in on who they now are and choose to present themself\u2014tips the situation into YTA territory.", "YTA - not for mourning a meaningful name to you, but making your grief her problem. You asked, she said no, that\u2019s her prerogative, and you should have dropped it then. My oldest is ftm, their deadname can be used for either gender and was very meaningful to me, but they are the one who has to live with it so I offered to pay for the name change when they graduated HS. Because, while the name was meaningful to me, it wasn\u2019t more important to me than my child\u2019s happiness. So ask yourself, what is more important to you, your child, or their name?\n\nEdit: spelling", "Yta. Coming from a trans perspective here, I understand that your emotions got the best of you- it happens to all of us and as long as you apologize you aren\u2019t ta for that. However, insisting that she incorporate your late father\u2019s name into hers is still an asshole-ish move. You must understand- the trope of trans people changing their name to the masc/fem version doesn\u2019t actually happen that often, and for a good reason; it\u2019s associated with a difficult and taxing part of their life that they\u2019re leaving behind. Some trans people will forever have a knee-jerk negative reaction to their deadname, even if they know it\u2019s not in reference to them. \nYta for assuming your daughter associates her deadname with your father as you do- to her, it\u2019s most likely only symbolic of a painful path she\u2019s now grown out of. \nHowever, this isn\u2019t absolute- coming from a trans person who has no deadname and goes by their birth name- it varies. When your emotions and her emotions are less charged, may I suggest apologizing and perhaps suggesting she add it as a middle name?", "YTA. Here's where I took the turn for sure - the fact that you gave birth to her does not, in fact, *entitle* you to try and impose your will on her. Your suggestion of her changing her name to one *you alone* chose was ridiculous, sorry.\n\nAnd I'll even put off the table the transgender thing for a moment - if your kid's name was Alex and she wanted to change it to Jordan, *it would be her right*. No one is obligated to carry the name their parents gave them, the reason doesn't matter.\n\nYou're attached to your daughter's dead name, understandably, but it's blinding you to *her* wishes, which do take precedence here. You *saying* you're sad she wouldn't choose a closer name would be one thing, to suggest she change her name legally to it and go by a different name was bad, saying \"you *deserve* a say\" because you *gave birth* to her... Yeah, that was terribly done.\n\nIt's not so much unsupportive of her as transgender necessarily, but it very much **is** unsupportive of her *as an adult*, as a *person* who wants an identity of her own, unrelated to other people's expectations.", "YTA - a name is a gift, not an obligation. Like any gift, the recipient can do what ever they want with it - keep it, change it or throw it away. \n\nIf the name is so important to you why not change YOUR name to Carla or something?", "YTA\n\nyou were doing so well till that last bit.\n\nIt is absolutely ok to have your own emotions about how it effects you...but you don't own a human, not ever and you don't have rights to their name.", "Reddit's gonna be skewed, but I'm going to say NTA.\n\nWhen you find out someone's not who you thought they were (good or bad), the life plan you imagined for them, and the relationship you thought you had, needs to be changed significantly. When this happens, it's reasonable to have a grieving response for the person that you lost, and not have those feelings overcome by the excitement and joy that comes from knowing your child has found themselves and how they fit in the world. Let them know you love them, you just need some time to grieve the child you thought they were so you can be ready to embrace the person they are, name and all", "YTa, you got to name her once, when she was a baby literally unable to name herself. now shes a grown ass adult and you still want to treat her like a baby that cant name herself? seriously? do you hear what youre saying? if either of my parents pulled this shit with me id never talk to them again. youre so entitled.", "YTA. She's correct. You made a very difficult moment for her all about you. I semi get why you're upset, but your daughter is an adult. You have NO say over what she chooses for a name just because you gave birth to her. That's total bs.", "YTA. She's her own person, she gets to choose her own name.", "NAH\n\nThere are parents that literally kick their children out and abuse them when they come out. You're trying to come to terms with it. You're having strong feelings, and this is okay. Some people just have robotic views of how coming out should go. Parents should be able to process as well.", "YTA.\nYou\u2019re allowed to feel things but you don\u2019t get to make your daughter deal with it. It\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about her.

YTA.", "YTA. You want her to have a constant reminder of your dead name for your own selfish reasons. One day you will be dead and gone but she will still have the name and have to live with that. \n\nAlso, she came out as transgender not \u201ctransgendered\u201d.", "YTA, even if you didn't mean to be. You prioritized your emotional attachment to a name ahead of your daughter's ability to openly embrace her full identity. By immediately asking her to effectively keep her deadname but with a slight twist, you signalled that you wanted to control how she goes about her transition. Some trans people do end up selecting an opposite sex version of their deadname. In my experience with friends, however, most don't. For many, their deadname carries the pain of struggling to come to grips with their identity in a violently anti-trans world, and represents their earlier inability to define themselves. It represents the lack of choice they were given up until the point where they can't out. Choosing a new name simply because it sounds pretty is empowering and affirming.\n\nThere are other times to mourn the loss of a name; this is a time to celebrate because you just gained a daughter.", "NTA, of course the popular vote is y-t-a, Reddit is crazy. You had an emotional reaction to something that means a lot to you. You never said you don't support your child. And you didn't force a name, you just asked. You're allowed to care about what name your child has and cry about it. It's not like you're trying to disown your own child or force them to let you pick a name. You're not an asshole at all no matter what these crazy comments say.", "Coming out to you was a huge emotional moment for her and instead of fully supporting her, you made it all about what YOU felt her name should be. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. Not for crying or feeling upset, but for not dealing with that internally instead of subjecting her to it. It's your issue to deal with, not hers, and you don't get to dictate her name. It would have been fine to bring up once, and immediately drop it when she said no. Anything beyond that is being unsupportive and she is right about you\n\nI'm trans and I changed my name in a way that was basically just my deadname gender swapped, but that was my choice. We get to choose our names", "All I can really says is:\n\nBruh. YTA clearly.", "YTA but I believe that you truly are supportive of your daughter\u2019s transition. Apologize and tell her you were wrong and you will support whatever name she chooses. Salvage your relationship asap and when things have calmed down, maybe then explain why you had such a strong emotional response to the name change. The important thing now is to repair the damage. If you love her no matter her gender, you\u2019ll love her no matter her name. \n\nShe\u2019s embracing a new identity, and distancing herself from the name you chose for her is not a rejection of you. It\u2019s a step towards being the person she feels she is/wants to be. She\u2019s probably more vulnerable now than she\u2019ll ever be.", "YTA-You gave birth to her but that doesn\u2019t mean you get a say in what she calls herself.

Based on the title, I came in expecting something in particular but still read it just to be sure.

Yet this managed to still land at YTA and it barely has anything to do with the transgender...\n\nYour daughter made a choice she's fully allowed to make as an adult.

Then you need to actually do better and support her every step of the way.", "YTA.\n\nYou definitely made this about you. I understand the name means a lot to you but I imagine that for a trans person using a different version of their dead name could be deeply triggering. \n\nYou would have been fine to bring it up later but not then and not push when she said no.", "YTA.  I have a dead name, having changed my name for deeply personal, but not gender-related, reasons.  Let me be clear, giving birth to a person-which was Your Choice- gives you Zero (0) say in this matter.", "YTA. Also\u2026very foolish.  Had you said nothing about the name for a while, your daughter might have come around to thinking a compromise was important.  My own trans kid felt that continuing to honor the relative they were named after was important, and arranged it.  But, I was sensible and didn\u2019t suggest anything when they came out, and by the time I was going to (really gently/diffidently) they had already decided it.  And, had my kid said, \u201cnope, not happening\u201d, that would have been the end of it.  It all depends on how things feel to the kid, and what things are comfortable and not.", "She's right. You are literally not supporting her. What you are doing is exactly the same as the parents who tell their kids that they'll always be X to them regardless of their transition and will only address them by their dead name.\n\nWhat you said about being her mother and getting a say in this (fuck off, you absolutely do not) is practically the same thing my dad and his wife say about my step brother and sibling.\n\nYou daughter came out to you and the first thing you did was show her that you are not an ally. YTA. You knew this before you posted this. Now go apologize to your daughter, genuinely, and actually support her.", "YTA. You did actually make this about you. She has the right to choose her own name. Have you considered she denied your request because having a similar name to her deadname gives her dysphoria? Apologize to her.", "YTA\n\nLady you are a piece of work\u2026", "YTA\n\nYour daughter isnt a doll, shes her own human being. She deserves a name that reflects what \\*she\\* wants it to, not what you want it to. \n\nHaving a say in, or even being present for, her life is an **absolute privilege**, not your right. YT massive A for thinking you have entitlement over anyone's life other than your own.", "YTA\nNow she\u2019s an adult she can make whatever choices she wants.\nYou named her after your father, which is your right. She now finds the name (of a person she never met) does not suit her anymore. She is entitled to make those changes. \nI understand that the name meant & means a lot to you, but it clearly does not to her.\nIt sounds like you have created a warm, loving & accepting family who value their family & friends for who they are. Please extend that same understanding to your daughter about this issue.", "It is a name. Get over it", "Its just a name..get over it", "YTA. You are making this about you and your feelings. You essentially want her to still use a version of her deadname. That says you want her to be constantly reminded of her old identity every time someone uses her name. And it\u2019s way for you still deadname her without fully doing it. She is an adult and can make her own decisions as to what name she wants to use and wanting to choose something completely different than her deadname isn\u2019t unreasonable at all! You are the one being unsupportive and unreasonable by trying to continue to deadname her.", "I don\u2019t even need to read this and I know YTA", "I'd cry too but for different reasons", "Cringe", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

My oldest daughter (MTF) has recently come out as transgendered. This was not a complete surprise as she has been very feminine for her entire life and both of us are very proud of her for finally coming out. My husband and I both have friends and a brother who is transgender, so when she has a lot of people in her corner who is rooting for her success and helping her with what she needs to live her life the best way possible. \n\nThe issue is that when she was born she was given the same name as my father who passed away a few months prior to her birth. This is a very masculine name, so when she came out she also announced she is going to change her name. I supported her changing her name; however, I asked her if she would be willing to rename to another name of my choice that is similar to her birth name as it was very important to me that she was named after my father. (Think like Carl to Carly). \n\nAfter I asked this she declined and said she wanted to go by a completely different name that has no meaning other than \u201cit sounds pretty.\u201d I asked her if she would legally change her name to Carly, but go by the name she chose in social settings. She said absolutely not. When she said this I left room and began to cry. My husband came after me and tried to calm me down, but soon my daughter came in and started yelling at me. \n\nShe told me I wasn\u2019t be supportive and making her transition all about me and my feelings and that I was no different than parents who don\u2019t support their kids transitions. I told her that was unfair and that I would support her regardless of her decision, but her dead name was very important to me so I would like her to try to find away to keep it. This is when I said something that my husband and eldest son think made me the ass hole: I told her that I gave birth to her and I deserve a say in this part of her life from being her mother. It\u2019s hard to convey the tone I said it, but I can assure the tone was not calm. However, I feel like I am not in the wrong. Her name is so important to me and I think she is being unreasonable but not allowing me to have a say in this part of her life. But now I feel like I\u2019ve been an asshole. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA\n\nShe came at you pretty hard at first. If she wants understanding, she should practice it.", "YTA. Your daughter is a complete and unique person and her desire for a name that represents that and expresses that trumps your desire to hold onto a name in honor of someone else. It sucks. It hurts. But it's true. Trying to force your child to continue through life with a name akin to their dead name is anything but supportive.", "YTA. Not for crying, but for insisting on picking her name. When we grow up, we get to pick our own names, whether we're cis or trans. Maybe we legally change our name; maybe we just go by a nickname, but we aren't obligated to keep the names our parents gave us.", "YTA. You did make it about you. Your child is not a shrine to you late father but an individual. She is allowed to pick her own name and the fact that you reacted like that means you need to handle your grief with a therapist. Clearly you have kept your father alive through your child\u2019s name. \n\nAlso I\u2019m not transgender but do have a name I hate and my mom loves. My mom would get absolutely no say if/when I change my name and make me get a name that sounds similar to my current name. It would keep the old name alive. And I just hate my name, it\u2019s not anything like a deadname!", "I think YTA. It is okay for you to be upset or sad that she is not keeping the name that meant so much to you and you have every right to grieve that loss. However, what is not okay is expecting her to compromise her authentic self in order to soothe your pain. It is selfish to make others responsible for our emotions. Additionally, regardless of what you were told or believe, children are not the property of the parent. You bring them into the world and it is your choice whether to care for them or not. If you choose to care for a child in hopes that someday they will shower you with gratitude and return your \"generosity\" later down the line, then you should not have had children. You birthed an autonomous being who has an individual consciousness separate from your own regardless of shared genetics. The name may mean a lot to you, but it will never and could never mean the same to her as it does to you. She is the one who has to live with the name day in and day out. She wants one that aligns with who SHE is. NOT who you WISHED she was. That is what it sounds like to her. She presented her authentic self to you, her mother, someone she likely expected support and comfort from, only to be met with rejection of that image and an ENTITLED demand to change. She is a person. Not a memento.", "YTA. You don\u2019t actually have a say in any part of her life. She wants to leave her old identity behind her, she doesn\u2019t want a constant reminder of that. If you want a say in her name then agree to meet the requirements and stipulations she set forth", "YTA. It's not about you. Grow up and get over it, and no - being a mother doesn't entitle you to shit. You earn that involvement in her life if she chooses it esp after 18, so far? You don't deserve it.", "NTA Although the problem with the name will be the least of their problems.", "Kind of the A. Yes, it makes sense that you would have a lot of big feelings around tradition. Unfortunately, it's not really about you, so this is something that you need to make peace with. You might broach the idea of a middle name. Maybe that would be a suitable compromise, but don't expect it.", "YTA. A child\u2019s name is the first gift they receive. But it\u2019s just that. A gift. They can do what they wish with it once they are old enough to decide for themselves who they are. Her deadname may have meaning to you, but to her it\u2019s a reminder of a painful time when she was trying to figure herself out. You need to stop making this about you and support your daughter.", "We should remember that legally adults can always change their name; we all have that opportunity.", "Tbh, l never understood the notion of naming your children after dead relatives. Like this just causes unreasonable comparison and unhealthy attachments, why do people do that?", "I think its also adjusting to a huge change and it's manifesting with the name. Gentle YTA because you're otherwise very supportive.", "Best response. Cant believe some people are actually likening OP to legitimately awful parents on here.", "^ this is it exactly. I understand where you're coming from because my son is named after both his grandfathers and all my daughters have family names as their middle names BUT, once they're adults, if they choose to change it, that's completely THEIR choice. It would hurt but they are their own people and have to be themselves, even if \"themselves\" are not the names I gave them.", "As a transgender person, I think it is unfair to say that she's the same as a completely unsupportive parent. I 100% think OP is an AH in this situation and agree with that she's making her daughter's huge experience about herself, but, oh, what I wouldn't give for this to be the worst reaction I received. That feeling of mine isn't related to the real point of the post, but, I think the daughter wouldn't equate the two if she knew what many other trans people know. Anyway, that's what my grief thinks.", "I think it's a very grey area that isn't discussed enough. As parents you're either supposed to be fully 100% understanding and supporting from the second you hear - which, many parents are - but it doesn't mean that parents don't need time to process it as well, and yeah, celebrate the child they \"are getting\", but they may still need to somewhat grieve the child they \"lost\". But at the same time, maybe that whole process isn't for the kid to see and know. \n\nAs a parent I want nothing but for my kids to be happy. I don't think it's an unfair question to ask if maybe you can be part of deciding the new name, but I do think YTA for pushing it.", "Maybe because a parent isn't supposed to feel grief? The only crying my mum did when I came put as trans was because she was scared of how the world will treat me, not some bullshit about grieving a child that is very much alive and trying not to live in suffering.", " No.  OP did NOT lose a son, because she never HAD a son to begin with.", "You know, when someone is trans and has pronouns that they clearly use, like op\u2019s daughter clearly using She/Her, using they/them pronouns is misgendering them intentionally and kind of messed up.", "But she did? She removed herself to her room, her husband and daughter went after her?", "the first bit is exactly what i was going to say! YTA. \n\n\nalso OP, PLEASE don\u2019t use the word \u201ctransgendered\u201d just transgender or trans is good.", "This. Give YOURSELF an additional middle name to honour YOUR Dad, a grandfather your daughter never met, and therefore has no obligations whatsoever towards.\n\nAdded verdict: YTA", "OP didn\u2019t just ask.  She asked, then threw a full on tantrum when she didn\u2019t get her own way.  She is 100% TA", "You are not entitled to name her. She's a legal adult and allowed to name herself whatever she wants to name herself. Unless she EXPLICITLY asked you to give her a new name, you don't have a right to choose.", "Heartily seconded. Couldn't figure out a clear way to say this, but this is perfect.", "Have you been living under a rock?", "What do you mean?", "Symbol of the patriarchy? What?", "That's true. What I should've said is that not many people have a good enough reason to bother with it.", "i did exactly that lol. changed my whole name just because i didn\u2019t like the first name my parents gave me and my last name was so uncommon that the number of people with it worldwide is in the low hundreds (therefore anything any member of the family with that surname did showed up on the first page of a google search and let\u2019s just say most of them weren\u2019t showing up for good deeds).\n\nafter i changed my name people around me realised you can literally just do that and it created a ripple effect; 3 friends of mine who just didn\u2019t like their first names changed theirs, then some of their friends followed suit, and at last count the number of people who changed their name because of someone who knew someone who knew me was upwards of 50, all because i thought my name was dumb and changed it on what was more or less a whim. \n\nsomething i will say is that if you change your first AND last name at the same time (maybe even just your first name idk), it\u2019s gonna be a massive pain in the ass for way longer than you think it will. six years down the line and i\u2019m still running into problems with it in the dumbest places.", "Not all tbh. Many countries don\u2019t allow first name changes unless you\u2019re trans (even then it\u2019s EXTREMELY difficult in many ways) or you present a valid reason why your birth name is causing you problems (like something purposefully demeaning, something that causes you extreme embarrassment, something that has a negative connotation/association, something that is actively holding you back in your life/career etc) or religious reasons (that still have to be \u201capproved\u201d).", "This very much.\n\nWhile less weird but also something I never understood was getting the same breed of replacement pet - if possible with the same or similar colors and worst offender calling it the same name.\n\nLike they never going to be the same even if they look alike. I rather morn x and learn to love y for themselves.", "\ud83c\udfc5\nI agree 100%.  It doesn't hurt to ask for her to use the feminine form of her deadname, but it shouldn't be pushed.  \nWhen someone comes out on their own terms, it typically means that they have had plenty enough time to process this and come to terms with it -- this can take a few weeks/months, up to a full lifetime! It can be hard to remember in that moment that this is (can be) brand new information to the person who you are coming out to.  They haven't had the time to process this yet.  For parents (especially in our heteronormative/cisgender society), they have up adjust their ideas and expectations for your future,  something they have been thinking about for at least your entire life. It's not something they can immediately change. That doesn't make them any less supportive though.", "21 years ago, OP did believe she gave birth to a son. Although, the child can now verbalize she is female, it doesn\u2019t negate the fact OP gave birth to an anatomical male.", "Exactly! I have two kids who are still young. I know I will support them no matter what, but it still would take some time for me to process everything. Ultimately I just want them to be happy with who they are, but that doesn't mean that I can just switch it in my brain immediately. If that makes any sense?"]}
