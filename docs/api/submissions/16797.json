{"id": 16797, "submission_id": "13cq29d", "title": "AITA for abandoning my friends at the cinema after they were almost 40 minutes late?", "selftext": "So this actually happened a couple of months back and I thought we were fine now but apparently not. \n\nSo I (30f) and my friends 'Amy' (31f) and 'Sam' (31f) had made plans to go to the cinema one Sunday evening. The showing was at 6.10pm so we'd planned on meeting at 5pm at one of the restaurants there for a quick dinner. \n\nMy friends live near eachother in the suburbs so Sam drove them and I walked as I live in the city. When I arrived I saw a message from Amy saying they were running 10 minutes late. I text her saying that's fine, to keep me posted and then I sit on one of the benches nearby and text her a pic of my view so she knows exactly where to find me (there's a line of benches spanning most of one side of the cinema) and play about on my phone. \n\nAt around 5.15pm I text her again asking if they have a restaurant preference and I'll go get us a table. 5 minutes later I try calling her and 5 minutes after that I try Sam. I knew Sam was driving but figured it would prompt Amy to either answer Sam's phone or look at her own. At 5.30pm on the dot (I was clock watching by this point) I throw in the towel and head downstairs to the exit. The weather has turned so I walk to the bus stop which is on the other side of the road and as luck would have it my bus is just turning the corner as I arrive so I jump on. \n\nI'd gone passed at least 3 stops by the time Amy calls me. To her credit she's immediately apologetic then tells me her phone was on silent in her bag in the back seat. She asks where I am and I tell her straight that I'm on the bus, that I'd waited as long as I could. She tells me to get off and I laugh. I say no, it's too late now, I'm starving and I'm just gonna pick up some food on my way home. I honestly wasn't furious or anything but even if I had gotten off when she called it's a 10/15 walk back to the building. It would have been too late for food at that point. She tells me she'd already purchased my ticket and I say I'm sorry but they were over half an hour late without contact and I just couldn't wait around for them anymore. I didn't offer to reimburse her. \n\nThe following day they both text me to apologise, I accept and think nothing more about it until this weekend where Amy brought it up when we were out with friends, 'joking' about me owing her a cinema date in a somewhat passive aggressive tone. She also blatantly denies it was nearly 40 minutes, claiming that I was being dramatic and it was 20 at most. It escalates and she basically tells me I'm being a bit of a dick for not even offering to pay for my ticket. Our friends are pretty evenly divided.\n\nI appreciate this is super low stakes but I'm genuinely curious if I'm in the wrong here? I'll absolutely take her out to the cinema if I'm deemed the asshole.\n\nETA: a few questions that are coming up in the comments/stuff I cut for character limit;\n\n1. Yes, there are call logs and this did come up on Sunday when we discussed it. Regardless, she attempted to claim that it couldn't have really been 30 minutes before I left since she called me at 5.38pm and I was already on the bus. I explained like I did in the post that the bus just happened to arrive as I got there so from bench to bus seat would have been around 3/4 minutes. There's not much traffic here on a Sunday so it was already some distance by the time she called. \n\n2. I didn't want to eat in a restaurant by myself. It was 40 minutes before the film when I gave up and around 30 minutes before Amy got in touch. I doubt we could have ordered and eaten before the start time.\n\n3. I could have popped into Starbucks or Gregg's (if they were still open) for a sandwich and would have probably done so had they kept me updated but I had no idea what was happening since they hadn't been in touch in over half an hour. \n\n4. Cinema just serves nachos, popcorn, ice cream etc. No dinner options. \n\n5. I didn't know Amy had bought the tickets already. That wasn't something we had discussed. \n\n6. Amy text me at 4.49pm to say they were running 10 minutes behind. It's a 30 minute drive from her house. I suspect she sent that before she got in Sam's car and instinctively chucked her bag in the back seat (seems weird to put the bag in the backseat once you're already in the front) and was just hoping they'd get there super quickly. \n\nI think that's it, feel free to ask anything else.", "created_utc": 1683639231, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cq29d/aita_for_abandoning_my_friends_at_the_cinema/", "score": 1014, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Your friends weren't late for the cinema and you still could have had a quick dinner anywhere on the way. Yet you decided to stomp down and go home.

Maybe my idea of timings and what time a person reaches is heavily influenced by the culture I am brought up in, but it is also imperative to me that I focus more on who I am with and what we intend to do and looking at the larger picture ie meeting with friends to hang out who are already on their way and, unfortunately for me, really late. But I do agree here, that beyond half an hour is too much, they should respect your time and communicate accordingly. But I have a question. Couldn't you have eaten, and then tell them when they arrived that there's no dinner happening, since they're late, and you'd all simply proceed for the movie? As I see it, there are 2 plans in place consecutively. The dinner and the movie. If they're late for dinner, it doesn't mean the movie plan has to be cancelled too by the virtue of them being late for the first one. The entire thing could have been avoided if they\u2019d communicated and you would have adapted to the new situation ie them being late and how to best deal with the new developments and new situations without getting upset and cancelling all the plans and ending a possibly great evening before it even started because your friends were late for 40 minutes, and they'd apologised, gotten your tickets, and requested you to come back as well. In aggression, I would probably think you overreacted too by cancelling everything because you got pissed at them for being late for dinner, but I don't think I'd agree with that either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But why wouldn't you require the same respect and accommodation back from them? this is a super minor issue and i think the biggest problem I would have with the whole thing is that its still beign brought up months later, by full grown adults. Both sides have an argument for being wronged, I still say its petty for the people who were late and dropped the ball on communication to be upset, but the fact that people who have nothing to do with such a minor situation are being dragged into it, tells me that Ops friends dont respect her, and want the AHA of being proven \"right\"", "NTA\n\nIf they're driving a long distance, stuff happens and some people just don't answer phones for make calls while driving.  Since they warned you they were running late, I would *probably* have waited for them until the showtime, but that's *very* dependent on the overall friendship.\n\nMy friend with complicated health issues who is still always there when needed, but who is never on time since her medical stuff is unpredictable?

I'd wait 5 to 10 minutes.  My husband's friends? I'd give them 30 minutes. They're flaky, but I really like my husband.\n\nBasically, my amount of patience and concern for how difficult it is to show up on time varies wildly based on the person and situation involved.  I have friends who see 2 minutes early as disrespectfully late and friends who feel like it's fine as long as they show up on roughly the same day as a party.\n\nSimilarly, I've had coworkers who no one noticed or cared if they were 3 hours late as long as they made up their time and a coworker who we called the police for a welfare check when he was an hour late.

Might be the most comfortable place to store it. Putting it in the back seat seems more odd. Why make the phone more inaccessible than necessary?\n\nPutting it on silent?

We had a chill chat where I was like \"look if you say you're running ten minutes late and you show up thirty minutes later that's twenty minutes of my time that I could have done something else with and you took that choice away from me\" and that was basically all it took for her to apologize and do things differently. \n\nAnd I try really hard not to shame her for being late, and to schedule things with lots of buffer time. It works out.", "I honestly don't know. It genuinely didn't occur to me to ask but like I said, I'd pretty much forgotten about the entire encounter until a couple of days ago.", "Not sure where you're getting that from but the plan was always to meet at 5 for a quick dinner. Sam had literally made that suggestion that very morning. When Amy text to say they were running late they meant for the early dinner, not the 6.10pm showing.", "Where exactly are you getting that OP tacked on the dinner last minute? The plan was always dinner and a movie.", "Maybe you should consider actually reading the post\u2026", "Yeah, it's a tired trope. It just means the cowboy is desperate so tries one final time to hit the other guy. Naked Gun being a parody would make sense.", "sure, i just bet in their minds that the show time was the ultimate thing they couldn't miss. they probably thought they could get dinner after if there wasn't enough time before. not really defending them but it's not uncommon to think that way when you're going to see a movie", "wow. they messed up in the first place. i would have eaten and watched the movie by my self so. but you are NTA for choosing to abondon ship", "That would infuriate me! I hate lateness and I get really hangry when I need to eat so I don\u2019t blame you for leaving. You have set your stall out for future meets though so they know you expect your time to be valued. NTA", "NTA- that being said, a lot of the people here are acting like they walked all over you, etc etc etc. Yes, no text or update is excessive, but I see her point of it being on silent. There are multiple different ways it could (and maybe should) have played out, but it ain't that serious. Maybe just take the L and pay for a movie strictly because they paid for a ticket that wasn't used, regardless of what led up to it. Squash it and move on, don't make a mountain out of a molehill", "@ u/Jewnicorn___ - thank you for the reward! \ud83d\udc9b", "Any chance her and Sam could have potentially been bumping uglies? I can't be the only one wondering..."]}
