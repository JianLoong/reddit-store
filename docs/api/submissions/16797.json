{"id": 16797, "submission_id": "13cq29d", "title": "AITA for abandoning my friends at the cinema after they were almost 40 minutes late?", "selftext": "So this actually happened a couple of months back and I thought we were fine now but apparently not. \n\nSo I (30f) and my friends 'Amy' (31f) and 'Sam' (31f) had made plans to go to the cinema one Sunday evening. The showing was at 6.10pm so we'd planned on meeting at 5pm at one of the restaurants there for a quick dinner. \n\nMy friends live near eachother in the suburbs so Sam drove them and I walked as I live in the city. When I arrived I saw a message from Amy saying they were running 10 minutes late. I text her saying that's fine, to keep me posted and then I sit on one of the benches nearby and text her a pic of my view so she knows exactly where to find me (there's a line of benches spanning most of one side of the cinema) and play about on my phone. \n\nAt around 5.15pm I text her again asking if they have a restaurant preference and I'll go get us a table. 5 minutes later I try calling her and 5 minutes after that I try Sam. I knew Sam was driving but figured it would prompt Amy to either answer Sam's phone or look at her own. At 5.30pm on the dot (I was clock watching by this point) I throw in the towel and head downstairs to the exit. The weather has turned so I walk to the bus stop which is on the other side of the road and as luck would have it my bus is just turning the corner as I arrive so I jump on. \n\nI'd gone passed at least 3 stops by the time Amy calls me. To her credit she's immediately apologetic then tells me her phone was on silent in her bag in the back seat. She asks where I am and I tell her straight that I'm on the bus, that I'd waited as long as I could. She tells me to get off and I laugh. I say no, it's too late now, I'm starving and I'm just gonna pick up some food on my way home. I honestly wasn't furious or anything but even if I had gotten off when she called it's a 10/15 walk back to the building. It would have been too late for food at that point. She tells me she'd already purchased my ticket and I say I'm sorry but they were over half an hour late without contact and I just couldn't wait around for them anymore. I didn't offer to reimburse her. \n\nThe following day they both text me to apologise, I accept and think nothing more about it until this weekend where Amy brought it up when we were out with friends, 'joking' about me owing her a cinema date in a somewhat passive aggressive tone. She also blatantly denies it was nearly 40 minutes, claiming that I was being dramatic and it was 20 at most. It escalates and she basically tells me I'm being a bit of a dick for not even offering to pay for my ticket. Our friends are pretty evenly divided.\n\nI appreciate this is super low stakes but I'm genuinely curious if I'm in the wrong here? I'll absolutely take her out to the cinema if I'm deemed the asshole.", "created_utc": 1683639231, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13cq29d/aita_for_abandoning_my_friends_at_the_cinema/", "score": 63, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And 30+ years is definitely old enough to know better.\n\nYou will probably see an even split in opinions - those who are loosey-goosey (and usually late), will tell you 20-30 minutes is \"nothing\", but the rest of us who value our time will probably say you are well within your rights to move on after 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nSounds like Amy actually believed you had nothing better to do than to wait for her. I'm also guessing you will have to develop a very thick callous about this issue; people of her type will needle and continue to air petty grievances like this for a looooonnnnng time.\n\nNTA.", "NTA. I'm sorry but 40 minutes without so much as a text is excessive. They should consider the cost of the ticket as asshole tax.", "NTA. I would not have waited as long as you did. After the second non response I would have bounced.  \nAlso, I would totally joke about you \u2018owing\u2019 a movie date, but you can also retort laughingly like \u2018yeah sure when I\u2019m 40 minutes late. Ha ha!\u2019", "NTA, although I would\u2019ve eaten without them and still gone to the movie.\n\nYou have your call/text history which should prove the time", "NTA being late is OK, having your phone silenced, not giving an update, then asking people you impacted to fix your mistake (pay the ticket back) is not ok.", "NTA. It irritates me to no end when your time is disrespected and  you are expected to be a doormat . You did nothing wrong. I would have done the same. You had plans, they were late to the point that you were hungry and would not be able to feed yourself, so you left. If these two have so little respect for you, I wouldn\u2019t hang out with them again.", "NTA, don't have any respect for people who cannot respect your time. People can run late but at least have the courtesy to inform each other.", "You told her you had left and were heading home, but she decided to buy the ticket anyway.  She had fair warning.  No money is owed to her. \n\nShe offered the apology and accepted.  That should have been the end of it, but I guess she doesn't seem the type to end this with her being the only one apologizing, right or wrong.  NTA OP", "NTA You waited 40 minutes for your friends with hardly any contact although you tried. They didn't bother to pick up the phone and let you know what was happening. They rudely dropped the ball. Tell Amy to eat the ticket.", "NTA \n\nBeing that late is already super inconsiderate but then to also not even keep you updated about their ETA is even worse. They wasted your time", "YTA. Your cinema was from 6.10 pm. You decided to go home at 5.30? Why didn't you grab something small to eat? You didn't go to the cinema at all? What sort of behavior is this, was the cinema the goal of the day or the dinner? This is very strange behavior. Your friends weren't late for the cinema and you still could have had a quick dinner anywhere on the way. Yet you decided to stomp down and go home. It's fine to do it, but if she indeed had bougt you a ticket already you should have paid for that because it was your decision to not go to the cinema - again you had 40 minutes more until that started.", "I don\u2019t want to call you the AH because late people are annoying, but you did give up when they were 20 minutes later than expected (since they told you 10 min late) and there was still plenty of time before the movie.  Are these friends often late? That would impact my judgement too.\n\nI get why they\u2019re frustrated that they spent money on you and you left 40 minutes before the movie.  There was plenty of time!", "I\u2019m sorry but I think YTA. Maybe my idea of timings and what time a person reaches is heavily influenced by the culture I am brought up in, but it is also imperative to me that I focus more on who I am with and what we intend to do and looking at the larger picture ie meeting with friends to hang out who are already on their way and, unfortunately for me, really late. But I do agree here, that beyond half an hour is too much, they should respect your time and communicate accordingly. But I have a question. Couldn't you have eaten, and then tell them when they arrived that there's no dinner happening, since they're late, and you'd all simply proceed for the movie? As I see it, there are 2 plans in place consecutively. The dinner and the movie. If they're late for dinner, it doesn't mean the movie plan has to be cancelled too by the virtue of them being late for the first one. The entire thing could have been avoided if they\u2019d communicated and you would have adapted to the new situation ie them being late and how to best deal with the new developments and new situations without getting upset and cancelling all the plans and ending a possibly great evening before it even started because your friends were late for 40 minutes, and they'd apologised, gotten your tickets, and requested you to come back as well. In aggression, I would probably think you overreacted too by cancelling everything because you got pissed at them for being late for dinner, but I don't think I'd agree with that either.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Kept their phone with them (not in the back) in case they hit traffic or have trouble parking. I hate that it's just become acceptable to be late now. You waited long enough. Although I would have got food and watched the film instead of going home.", "NTA. 40 minutes late with no explanation and no contact is not ok. The very fact that they did not offer an explanation implies they do not have one. This in turn implies that they think their time is more valuable than yours which is just disrespectful.", "NTA. They can't expect you to wait like that.", "NTA - She should have checked her phone or contacted you before buying your ticket. I personally would have just eaten without them and still gone to the movie but mentioned to them that I wasn't happy with how they had wasted my time.", "NTA You didn't abanoning them! They abanded you! They were ruining late and knew it wasn't 10 minutes. And they didn't even care to contact you or were possible to contact. How should you know that they even come? How long should you wait? You are not a dog! Their behaviour is so disrespectful as if your time has no worth. \n\nI would be especially pissed with the behaviour afterwards with talking shit about you \"It was just 20 min at most and OP is soooo dramatic! She ruined our night with her being a dick!\"", "\"asshole tax\" - OMG LOVE IT AND STEALING IT!!!", "I deleted some stuff for character count but I did ask her if she wanted to get her phone out and check and she initially declined but later changed her mind and pointed out the fact that my last call to her was at 5.21pm and argued that she had told me she was running late and I should have allowed for some leeway. I reminded her that I waited 5 minutes to try Sam's phone after that and then another 5 before getting up off the bench. \n\nShe then told me that that couldn't be correct as I was already on the bus when she called at 5.38pm. I don't really know what else to say to that. The bus was literally pulling up when I got there so from bench to bus seat could only have been around 3/4 minutes.", "And was her phone silenced or was that an excuse for ignoring the call because she was so late.", "I\u2019m guessing she bought the tickets ahead of time, not that she bought them after OP left.", "Dinner was planned for 5pm though. Even allowing for some leeway since they said they were running 10 minutes late they were still nearly half an hour late and hadn't bothered to text OP", "Cinema may have been from 6.10pm but we'd planned to meet at 5pm to go for dinner. As far as I was concerned these were equal 'goals' as you put it. We had plans from 5pm.", "The plans were for 5pm. not 6:10pm. I dont give a shit if we are going to a concert that starts at 7. If the plan was we are meeting at 5pm to get ready. The plans start at 5. Not 7.", "keeping in mind they were planning on going to a restaurant for food together before the movie started. 40 minutes to order and eat wouldnt be enough time, it would barely be enough time at a fast food joint, to then get into the theatre and to your seats. Im hoping you are being sarcastic. Op is in No way the AH here. Her friends that lied about their timeline are the assholes here. Zero respect for their friend.", "Ok, so not only was she rude at the time but she's now calling you a liar? My guess is she's well aware she fucked up but is just grasping at straws to save face. You know that bit in every Western when the cowboy runs out of bullets so he just throws his gun?", "Not sarcastic. If the lateness was a one off for my friends, I\u2019d have given them more leeway.  Because they\u2019re my friends, I like them and want to spend time with them.  Now if they\u2019re late all the time, that\u2019s different.\n\nAnd yes 40 minutes is too tight for sit down, but would be plenty of time for quick service. Or they could have gotten food at the movie.", "I appreciate that you are all about respecting your friends and going out of your way to accommodate and spend time with them. But why wouldn't you require the same respect and accommodation back from them? this is a super minor issue and i think the biggest problem I would have with the whole thing is that its still beign brought up months later, by full grown adults. Both sides have an argument for being wronged, I still say its petty for the people who were late and dropped the ball on communication to be upset, but the fact that people who have nothing to do with such a minor situation are being dragged into it, tells me that Ops friends dont respect her, and want the AHA of being proven \"right\""]}
