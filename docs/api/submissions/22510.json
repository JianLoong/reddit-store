My BIL was a teacher & hated it. Now he tutors kids in HS math. He works a couple of hours a day & makes more than he made teaching. He picked up a job life-guarding in the summers when the kids are in school, and he just stayed on. So now he has a full time job with the city with great benefits, and he works as a tutor at night. So now he\u2019s doing pretty well financially & is pretty happy.\n\nPoint is, June can probably figure out a way to make more money. I hope she doesn\u2019t have kids if she\u2019s already bitter about money. Why did her hub need a master\u2019s to manage a restaurant?\n\nAnyway, June\u2019s incessant complaining is annoying. \n\nPs: Whenever anyone says \u201cmust be nice\u201d the best possible response is \u201cyes, it is! It really, really is!\u201d", "Not gonna lie, as a teacher myself that title got me heated from the jump but I think I have to say NTA. \n\nI understand why you snapped. I have been around people who are always making comments like that, and it's so draining. It starts to feel like you can't tell those people anything cause everything is a misery competition. If she is always being negative that can be hard to constantly walk around and ignore. \n\nBut also I see where she's coming from. It sounds like maybe she has some insecurities about choosing another path as compared to her siblings, as the golden children comment might imply. I'm sure she loves teaching, but maybe she wasn't ready for feeling so different from the rest of her family. Maybe she feels insecure or out of place. \n\nI think you guys could benefit from a good heart to heart about the situation. You can explain where you're coming from, and she can explain her experience and maybe give some insight into why she's been acting like that. \n\nI don't know how she feels but maybe there's a bit of shame attached to not having as much. Maybe those comments were her searching for validation that she's doing great as she is, and she doesn't need to be at the same financial level as the rest of you because you're more than proud of her as she is. \n\nI hope you guys can see eye to eye soon, teaching can take a lot out of you and it can be discouraging to not see much come out of it financially, especially if your family is doing well off comparatively.", "NTA\n\nTitle had me worried but this is very reasonable. She's not complaining that she has it bad, she's complaining that the rest of you have it better. Everything you listed isn't \"ugh, we couldn't afford new clothes\" it's \"wow, great that YOU can afford new clothes, we cannot\" so it's framed in an accusatory tone, and makes everyone around her feel bad if they mention anything they do that involves money (including something as simple as money for gas). She has huge bitterness issues over the income differences and that's a problem for her to figure out, not you.", "NTA\n\n* However, she is always jealous and complaining about how hard she has it.\n\nYikes, no one wants to hear someone in their 30s complain about choices they made. \n\n* she says things like \" must be nice to go on vacation\", \" must be nice to get new furniture\", etc\n\nThose things are nice, but they have nothing to do with her. She should mind her own business and not try to make people feel bad for being comfortable in life. \n\n* I snapped. I told her her constant complaining was getting old, we gave her the same help with her college and grad school as her siblings, and she knew when she chose her career what the salary was .\n\nThat's fair, you have to shut down her petulant attitude. \n\n* She was furious and left, screaming that her siblings are \" golden children\" and that she was just as good.\n\nIt doesn't sound like her siblings are golden children, it sounds like she's insecure and constantly compares herself to them. \n\n\nShe only has herself to blame. She should never be saying things like \"must be nice...\" that's just rude and probably her being hostile.", "Info: do you often gather with your other two kids at this vacation home? Do you plan other/any family gatherings that would be easily afforded by the rest of the family but a big financial outlay for June? \n\nHer golden child comment strikes me as odd unless there is information missing. June made her choice to be a teacher, and good for her for stepping in to the much needed but vastly underpaid profession. However, June didn\u2019t make the choice to be outcast in the family if the family dynamic currently consists of weekends or holidays at a vacation home when this is a big strain on June and husband. I\u2019m curious why she thinks the others are golden children. Did you do a lot of encouraging to your children to pick law as a profession? If you truly reflect on your engagement with all children, is it possible that (even without intent) you and the other children have made your financial standing overtly known and made decisions for the family without her financial means as a consideration? If you spend every Christmas at this home and your other two children can gather up their families in a newer large SUV and come away to spend time easily with PTO while June and husband don\u2019t have the ability to drive or fly to this home without financial hardship or putting unnecessary miles on a truly old vehicle, then I can see why she may be frustrated with you regarding her financial state. It is great to have provided all children with the same or very similar means and starting points in life but if you are not taking her finances into account when planning things as a family it would be easy for her to feel devalued and left out. Is this happening?", "My mom came from decent wealth, and she chose the bohemian life of an artist, and then art teacher. Things were honestly pretty similar here. My uncle was a doctor. My aunt a biomedical researcher. My cousins all went on fancy vacations to cool places... I had one vacation outside the bordering states to us by the time I was in high school... But like... my mom also a) very much recognized she made a *choice* when she went to art school (which she was quite happy with) and b) was nothing but grateful for the help her parents offered at times, such as paying for her college, and then helping with the downpayment on the house my parents raised us in.\n\nSo as written... NTA (I say that because I have to ask whether she meant to say she always felt they were 'golden children' even as children, or if that is just current projection). Different choices in life lead to different outcomes, and it doesn't sound like anyone is going out of their way to rub their relative success in life in her face, or otherwise try to make her feel bad. If she is just complaining at every nice thing her siblings do or get... then yes, she needs to recognize life goes that way, and there is a point where I can't fault your frustration in her failure to recognize it from boiling over.", "NTA. I get the dissatisfaction at your siblings and family having second homes and money for furniture and experiences, but it is not breaking news that lawyers make more than teachers, generally. And she had undergrad and masters paid for? \n\nNobody wants to hear constant complaining, especially from someone who chose where they are. Have you asked her what she expects you to do about it, how you should respond? Does she just expect everyone to give her money?", "NTA - But I think it would benefit everyone if you and your husband actually sat down with her and asked what it is she wants/expects you to do about her situation. She is an adult and if she has an issue with you or needs something from you, she needs to discuss it with you like an adult. \n\n\"We love you, we are proud of you, and we want you to be happy. But we are not sure what you are looking for from us when you complain about how your financial situation compares to our financial situation or your siblings' financial situations. Is there something you wish we had done differently or that we could be doing differently now?\"\n\nI am not saying give in to whatever she asks. Obviously it would unreasonable for her to ask for ongoing financial assistance from you that make her financial situation on par with what her siblings make from their jobs. And if she doesn't want anything except to be able to bitch and moan, then you should stick with your initial response. But maybe together you can come up with a plan to improve her financial situation. If its something reasonable but that would be a significant financial output for you and you are worried about treating your kids equally, you could offer to make an addendum to your will that the gift of that money now would be factored in to how any future inheritance is split between her and her siblings.", " NTA. She needs to find a district that pays better. Get more education and jump up pay levels. Get into administration. Run some clubs. Tutor.\n\nThere are more people making better money that you think. \n\nIf hubby is running a single restaurant owned by a private person he should go to a chain and move up in management.", "NTA. \n\nHer complaining isn\u2019t a one time thing, it\u2019s her mindset. She is constantly comparing and becoming bitter in her comments. It\u2019s exhausting to be around. Rather than let that develop, when you love someone you may need to gently point out she is in a situation of her own choosing.", "NTA. I'm sure her Debbie Downer act was getting super old. It was probably long overdue that someone said something.", "NTA because how she is going about this is very childish. I could see an argument if she was asking you to protest or help fight for better pay for teachers, aid in her striking or any number of other variations of supporting her to improve her field, but just complaining about it like she is happens to be hilariously immature.", "Nta op, it looks like you are proud of all of your kids, and you help them being what they want to be. You have them equal opportunities. You paid for her college, you help her with her down payment. She was incredible privileged to have that, this is way more than most people have. However every choice will have an outcome, and being an adult is to understand that you are responsible for your choices.\n\nTeachers are important and underpaid, the 2 things are true. But she chose that path in her life, as her husband. If disposable income was something this important to them, they should choose other career paths or maybe invest in another career path now.\n\nOf course hearing the true is hard, and sometimes painful, but she is not a kid anymore, she is in her 30s and need to have a grip", "Nta. She needs a reality check.  She literally got a free ride to college and chose a career that doesn\u2019t pay. You don\u2019t get to pick a field you KNOW doesn\u2019t pay and then complain that you aren\u2019t making what a lawyer does.", "NTA. The unfortunate reality is that teachers are vastly underpaid. The thing is, you're not in control of that, OP. How your daughter is reacting is to put the blame on a single individual instead of thinking critically and seeing the bigger picture. Makes sense, she sees all of you and how comfortable your lives are, so the comparison is the easiest to make. If she really wants to get paid more, she'd change professions or rally her coworkers and union to go on job action.", "NTA. Obviously the world needs teachers and they are vastly underpaid for the work they do, but she knew it going in. No one wants to hear anyone complain about not having money every time they're around.\n\nIf she's unhappy, she needs to look into perhaps pivoting from elementary to college, if she can, or teaching summer school, or, if she doesn't want to take up her summers, coaching during the regular school year. It's a true shame, but all my friends who are teachers do *something* else on the side. I'm not a teacher but I held two jobs simultaneously for 20 years - this past fall I finally, *finally* got a better day job within my company and was able to \"retire\" from the part time job.", "NTA - It sounds like she is extremely jealous of everyone around her and that is just not how the world works. I am glad you didnt placate her.", "NTA... you gave her every opportunity to have the same charmed life as her siblings and she made her choice, she knew she would never have money, that was one of the known drawbacks of the field she chose, she needs to live with it.", "Ooof, this is a tough situation, but I would you're NTA. I can understand why you snapped, but have you sat down with her and had a wholehearted talk about the situation? Maybe asked her if she wanted to change careers? If there's anything she wants to do to change her situation? \n\nI wanted to go into chemical engineering when I was going through school, but my mother forbade me from it due to 'expected salary', and I chose to go into tech instead since they were paying most of my tuition. Honestly, I still have mixed feelings about it, but I'm not holding a grudge or anything, since they paid for my schooling, and I'm quite fortunate.", "NTA you helped her as much as your other kids. Why should you or them feel bad for the things you have?\n\n\u201cIt does get old to hear must be nice?\u201d You gave her the reality check she needed.\n\nThe fact is I think she expects you and your family to supplement their income which isn\u2019t fair. And now she is jealous that you don\u2019t.", "NAH but you maybe have to decide whether being \u201cright\u201d here is more important to you than your relationship with June. It would be easy to write this off as plain jealousy but the \u201cgolden children\u201d comment and her increasing alienation from the rest of the family suggests there\u2019s more going on here. If you care about her and want her to stay in your lives, think about reaching out and try not to just write her off as \u201cbroke and envious, made bad choices, married a loser,\u201d or whatever else she\u2019s assuming you\u2019re all judging her over. Because that\u2019s probably what this was all about. Even if you think you\u2019ve done nothing to make her feel that way, that\u2019s what she was telling you with her outburst.", "NTA, you are correct, you have each child the same privilege of college. Choosing a field that does not pay well & then bitching about the pay is silly.", "NTA - why do some family member get to be jerks without anyone pointing that out?", "Tough spot - she shouldn\u2019t complain but tight money is tight money no matter the fault \u2014- she is placing blame on wrong people obviously\u2014 you choose careers based on many things /- pay is a consideration\u2014 while she does a worthwhile career it just isn\u2019t as lucrative as her siblings \u2014 for family get together a blunt honest discussion is needed with all members - life is too short \u2014 maybe those with means can ease expenses if get togethers", "Spoiled child.", "Really wish people valued the people they entrust their children to and paid them a livable wage. Guess we should just stick some under achievers , popes, and dumb dumbs with that job? I\u2019ll get downvoted to oblivion but you are horrible", "NTA but I think a better approach would have been telling her that it\u2019s not too late to reconsider her career choice if she isn\u2019t happy with her current one. That\u2019s constructive criticism and it is much more likely to get the result you\u2019re hoping for. I know teachers who loved their jobs but they the financial strain was too much so they walked away. June wouldn\u2019t be the first one to do it but maybe she needs someone to tell her that.", "NTA. Constant complaints get old fast. She made her choices and if she wants to change careers she is free to do so. You didn't make her be a teacher.", "NTA I have a sister that uses the \u201cmust be nice\u201d complaint all the time. I finally told her if she and her husband stopped smoking and drinking more than a house note a month, they could afford nicer things. All this to say, make different choices and you get different results.", "it just sounds like she is very unhappy as to how her life turned out even thou she made those decisions.  i also wonder if this has to do with her husband too being in low income bracket as well and things maybe not going well in her marriage.  maybe check in and see how she is doing personally like ask her is she happy?  spend a one to one time with her and have a frank discussion.  it honestly sounds like she grew up with everyone an achiever and she feels different.  and thats ok too not everyone is cut out for certain things.", "Well, I realize you didn\u2019t sign on for this role but have you considered showing her how much you support her career choice by sending her gas money a few times a year to join everyone at the lake house? Would it be that difficult for everyone to chip in a bit for a tank of gas? Do you do stuff like contribute to her classroom start up fund at the beginning of the year if she has one for supplies? \nJust a reminder that while you and your husbands career choices are for sure the reason you have a comfortable life, a lot of lower paid workers also enable your comfortable life and without them it wouldn\u2019t exist. Teachers are some of those people. They took care of and educated your three children for more than 16 years each it sounds like. So obviously you\u2019ve experienced how valuable teachers are for society? I think it\u2019s hard for people who work in caretaking jobs within society to feel respected by family when family won\u2019t try and level the playing field to make sure they can be included. It\u2019s a small way you can acknowledge her sacrifice\u2019s economically to do something so important in society. We can\u2019t all be lawyers or we wouldn\u2019t have a functioning society at all.", "NTA -she knew damn well she wasn\u2019t going to be paid well and did it anyway. There\u2019s no point in purposely doing something then complaining about it to others who have no say in that choice", "NTA - Your daughter has a very childish attitude. Who is she complaining to anyway when it's the profession *she* chose? Anyone who didn't get financial help like you gave her could say to her: \"It must be nice to get all that free money from parents\".", "ESH, except for your husband and your mother. \n\nYour first paragraph makes my blood boil. You sound like such an arrogant ass, obsessed with money and status, talking about how the people in your family who are in the legal and engineering fields \"make a good living\" like you are in a special elite club.\n\nYour daughter is a brat, also obsessed with status and money (gee, I wonder where she learned that) who probably needs to cut down on her time with you, for both of your sakes.\n\nI abhor your use of the phrase \"on my side\" when talking about your other daughter. Sounds like you're insisting that the entire family turn against June, while being dismissive of your husband's and mother's very reasonable input.\n\nYou don't sound like you're proud of her, in spite of your saying you are. You sound like you consider her a nuisance, which she admittedly is, but you also paint such a negative picture of her and such a positive picture of yourself, that I find it suspicious.\n\nBottom line: Your family sounds toxic. Set boundaries about money and discussion thereof, be supportive of one another, and work on how you show love.", "NTA.  Bottom line is she made a choice.  If she\u2019s unhappy with it, it is up to HER to do something about it.  Is she allowed to feel frustrated?  Absolutely.  But again, it\u2019s her choice.", "NTA. Nothing you said was unfair or untrue. The AH here is the criminally low wages for teachers. It\u2019s not\nfair. But you are also correct that she chose this profession knowing that fact.", "NTA. \n\nI'm a former teacher.  I knew when I went into it what the pay was like.  Granted I didn't understand exactly how hard it would be, but the pay is a known thing that can easily be looked up.  \n\nHer complaining constantly and making snide remarks isn't cool at all.  And I can understand after being subjected it it for a while, how that could happen", "NTA", "Sounds like she's unhappy, and took it out on you. She knows she chose her life, but clearly there's some unrest in some part of it - finances, perhaps her marriage, who knows.\n\nWhen you reconnect with her, try just listening. You can't fix anything, nor should you try. She just may need someone to empathize with her.\n\nNAH.", "Nta.\n\nSounds like she generally complains about everything to do with money and doesn't want to hear a word about accountability.\n\nTeacher salaries are well known. She knew what the future held. She needs to stop complaining about the consequences of her own choices.", "Just skimmed this, and i know you're NTA. She made her choices. Now she needs to make some changes if she wants more money. Teachers sure as hell deserve better pay. But as of this moment. They dont get it. So she ends to put on her big girl panties and deal with it", "ESH\n\nPreparing for downvotes. \n\nI don't know what people are smoking. These people all think they shit gold. Stop the materialism. Stop the scorekeeping. Love each other. Or, prepare for your family to become estranged from each other.

It's very close to E S H. \n\nShe does need to take responsibility, but it doesn't seem like a huge stretch for some of this anger from June to be coming from how proud you are of your well-off children, especially those who followed in your / your husband's footsteps by going into law. She may feel like the black sheep who went another way and then was excluded or detached from the rest of her family, when in reality it's partly or mostly the financial disparity stemming from their lines of work. \n\nObviously it's not good etiquette to brag about or flaunt your wealth, your purchases, etc. to people you know cannot afford to do those things. How much has the family tried to make it possible for June's family to remain involved, or to make plans (say holidays, vacations, get-togethers, etc.) that don't require a lot of money to participant? It is also awful etiquette to make snide remarks and she clearly is jealous but I guess my point is that there seems to be a lot more going on here.", "YTA for how you snapped at your daughter.  She is frustrated and demoralized.  I get the constant complaining is frustrating.  But it also sounds like no one has really reciprocated in a productive way.\n\nIt is probably time to reach out to your daughter and have a heart to heart with her.  Make some changes so this can be resolved.  It sounds like she feels isolated and disconnected.  Not just because she isn't at the same income level, but she also has a different career than the rest of you.  You can all connect and bond over the legal industry, and she can't.  Then you all have access to resources and amenities that she does not.  Whether it is fiscal constraints or something else, the biggest factor is she is isolated and not feeling the camaraderie she should with her family.", "ESH.\n\nYour daughter has to put up with living at a much lower income level than the rest of the family.

They are both very hard workers and I am proud of June for doing well at a very hard, and vastly underpaid job. However, she is always jealous and complaining about how hard she has it. She's complained we have a cabin in the UP ( Michigan) and she's got a starter home ( that we gave her $$ for) . She's complained about her sister having nice clothes, her brother's house in the lake, her husband having loans for his masters , us having nice cars, you name it. \nShe constantly complains. Every damn time she comes over, she says things like \" must be nice to go on vacation\", \" must be nice to get new furniture\", etc. Last night she started again, complaining that she can't afford to go to the UP house and it \" must be nice to be able to afford gas\" and \" still be able to wear fancy clothes\". \n\nI snapped.

Period.\n\nYou don't deserve it, but if you know it before going into that job, then that is on you. She made a conscious choice to go into a field that is notoriously under paid.", "Its her fault she choose that career while ALSO wanting to have a luxurious life", "It was her decision to choose a career that under pays, so the consequence to that is being broke. \n\nOf course no one wants to hear her complain.", "Do you beleive the daughter should not exercise a lick pf personality responsibility?  Nobody held a gun to her head and made her become a teacher.\n\nIf she wanted to keep up with her siblings and have disposable income, then being a teacher was the wrong job for her.\n\nYou are correct in that teacher's dont deserve to be underpaid but that is a strawman argument.  You are stretching a barely related point to discuss something not germane to this discussion.  \n\nYes you are right about teacher pay is abysmal.  That doesnt detract from the daughter's responsibility to choose the right profession for her and her goals.", "No the point is there. Don't bitch about being underpaid to your family when you choose the job that is widely known to be underpaid. If she was channeling that energy into political change more power to her, but she isn't she's just complaining to her family which gave her every advantage in life.", "She sure talks about the other ones like they are, and that June is lesser than, for being a teacher.", "[deleted]", "If you think teachers only teach class and grade, you need a serious reality check. Teaching involves a significant amount of planning, prepping, after school cleaning, hall monitoring, involvement in extracurriculars, dealing with parents, going to faculty meetings, IEP meetings, etc. all while paying for all of one's own classroom supplies. \n\nThe dismissiveness and judgment toward educators that I've seen in this thread is thoroughly depressing.", "No I don't believe that teachers are paid fairly but the reality is that they are under paid so if you decide to go into that job you are fully understanding what you are getting yourself into", "With a MFA his schedules for the restaurant staff must be exquisite.", "I agree teaching is a really important, really hard job that deserves more pay. \n\nHowever, becoming a teacher if you highly value lots of disposable income for second houses and nice cars is a bad career choice *for you*.", "I'm just sitting here, stunned, mulling over the fact that I never knew \"tinned fish\" was such a lovely, lovely phrase. I mean, we're talking \"cellar door\" lovely. I'm going to be hearing this in my head all night now.", "Oh for crying out loud.  Talk about tone deaf.  Poor June.", ">why would they want to have her company\n\nIt's her daughter?", "I didn\u2019t really get that. She said she works hard was proud of her and that teachers are underpaid.  It\u2019s just a fact that teachers are underpaid and everyone knows that. It\u2019s admirable that\u2019s what she wanted to do, but she\u2019s taking the fact that she\u2019s underpaid out on the wrong people.  OP said in another comment that she\u2019s paid for several vacations for them and they are always free to use the lake houses, which should make a vacation much more attainable.", "June is the one complaining about the diffferences. June is the one who chose a teaching profession. I'm simply asking if June has the same concern when her siblings are putting in the much longer days.", "Right? I thought of being a teacher, and the salary is what put me off. I think teachers are just as valuable as doctors and lawyers, but they aren't paid the same which most people are aware of when they go into the career. I wouldn't want to hear complaining about it either all the time.", "And similarity of blood does nothing to make an excruciating person worth being around.", "Ah. I get what you\u2019re trying to say now. My mistake! \n\nHard to say, really. If she\u2019s as exhausting as OP makes her out to be, who knows if they even talk about work around her without it turning into a pissing contest of who has it harder.\n\nBut we also don\u2019t know her workload, hours, or  the day to day functions of the school\u2019s administration that could cause extra stress, either.\n\nOP is still NTA though.", "OP never called her excruciating so that's pretty irrelevant to the discussion don't you think?"]}
