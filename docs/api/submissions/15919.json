We stayed at an airbnb. It was a nice house, and the \"kids\" i.e me, my twin, and my cousins 'M' (17f) and her brother(12m) had two rooms, both with an ensuite to share between us. I wanted to share with my brother, but M said she wanted to share with me. This was the last thing I wanted. \n\nM and I shared a room last holiday and it nearly drove me mad. She keeps the lights turned on all the time, even when sleeping, doesn't clean her hair out of the drain after showering, and needs music to fall asleep. I need silence and darkness to sleep. That holiday was horrible for me in terms of sleep. \n\nWhen I insisted on sharing with my brother, M pulled me aside and told me she was on her period and didn't want to share a room with her brother because of that. But I didn't understand why that was a problem, and I really wanted to be able to sleep so I said no. \n\nThe rest of the holiday was her saying how weird it was that I was okay with sharing a room with my brother even though I'm almost an adult. \n\nAfter we all went home, M messaged me and said that she had a horrible time because of me. She told me because she has her own room and bathroom at home, she was uncomfortable sharing one with her brother especially when she was on her period. I ask her why she didn't tell me this part while we were there, because I probably would have changed my mind if I had known. She says she told me she felt uncomfortable, and that should've been reason enough for me. I haven't replied to her yet. \n\nNow I feel bad because I hadn't taken that into account when I said I didn't want to share with her. I've always had to share a bathroom with my brother so it hadn't even occurred to me that this is something M might be unused to. \n\nBut I'm still mad that M tried to make the fact that I was more comfortable sharing a room with my brother than I was with her into something I should feel bad about. Like, he's my twin. We shared a room until we were 11. I'm okay sharing a room with him for a few days while we're on holiday.", "created_utc": 1682697882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131yxag/aita_for_sharing_a_room_with_my_brother_instead/", "score": 111, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why is that a reason to demand someone accommodate you and ignore their own needs?", "So all 4 of you were sharing the one jack and Jill en-suite bathroom?

That\u2019s not her. \n\nI would loop your parents in on this, not for them to do anything, at least not at this point, but more for them to be aware that she is insinuating nasty things about you and your brother just because she didn\u2019t get her way. \n\nIf she keeps insisting on bringing this up, def get parents involved, not just informed. \n\nYou are NTA for wanting to be able to sleep.", "I would just let her know that the two of you are not compatible sleep-mates.

Her period issues with her brother and are her own, I wouldn't even comment on it.  If she tries to make your relationship with your brother into something it isn't just respond with \"ewww....gross.  What would even make you go there?  He's my twin!\"  If she doesn't want to continue the relationship that's on her, but I'd only reach out once.", "You\u2019ve probably already replied to her by now but, I mean, in some respects I can understand. A woman\u2019s menstrual cycle can often be an emotional and sometimes vulnerable time for many women. You\u2019re in incredible pain, you don\u2019t feel like yourself, and you just feel\u2026.blah. When I got them, I sometimes didn\u2019t even feel comfortable around my father. \n\nDefinitely tell her why you didn\u2019t want to share a room with her but, still be polite about it. Tell her something like, \u201clook, I\u2019m sorry about not switching with your brother. I really didn\u2019t understand your feelings. I still don\u2019t really but, another reason why I didn\u2019t want to share a room with you is because-you\u2019re not-the best roommate.\u201d Give her the reasons and why and, IF everything remains civil, maybe come up with solutions.\n\nIf she needs music, put Bluetooth earbuds in(there are some good cheap ones), and set the phones timer, to turn off the music. If she needs light, she can bring a nightlight. There are some really beautiful ones out there, that are just great. I actually own a couple! One is a moon light and It comes in three sizes. It has a remote and is also touch activated. It can turn multiple colors, shades, and you can also adjust the brightness, AND it has a timer! I love the thing. I use it with my dogs too. It might just be dull enough for you to still sleep, yet bright enough for her", "NTA   Her behavior is what made you not want to share a room with her.

This was her problem.  And he's your twin brother, that's an even closer bond.  You've shared a womb with him for gosh sake.   What's a room for a week or two?  Geesh!\n\nI hope you had a great time on your holiday.", "Did you point out to her how unomfortble she made you the year before?", "NTA.

Follow up with something like you love her and that you guys just have different sleep methods.", "its ironic to me she says \u201ci cant share a room with my brother\u201d *to a girl who also has a brother*. It sounds like some of the other comments are maybe getting at something\u2014 is *she* uncomfortable with her body (because thats fine and can be addressed), or is she saying her *brother* is uncomofortable which again can be addressed,,,,,, or is she just making it up? either way NTA"]}
