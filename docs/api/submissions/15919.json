We stayed at an airbnb. It was a nice house, and the \"kids\" i.e me, my twin, and my cousins 'M' (17f) and her brother(12m) had two rooms, both with an ensuite to share between us. I wanted to share with my brother, but M said she wanted to share with me. This was the last thing I wanted. \n\nM and I shared a room last holiday and it nearly drove me mad. She keeps the lights turned on all the time, even when sleeping, doesn't clean her hair out of the drain after showering, and needs music to fall asleep. I need silence and darkness to sleep. That holiday was horrible for me in terms of sleep. \n\nWhen I insisted on sharing with my brother, M pulled me aside and told me she was on her period and didn't want to share a room with her brother because of that. But I didn't understand why that was a problem, and I really wanted to be able to sleep so I said no. \n\nThe rest of the holiday was her saying how weird it was that I was okay with sharing a room with my brother even though I'm almost an adult. \n\nAfter we all went home, M messaged me and said that she had a horrible time because of me. She told me because she has her own room and bathroom at home, she was uncomfortable sharing one with her brother especially when she was on her period. I ask her why she didn't tell me this part while we were there, because I probably would have changed my mind if I had known. She says she told me she felt uncomfortable, and that should've been reason enough for me. I haven't replied to her yet. \n\nNow I feel bad because I hadn't taken that into account when I said I didn't want to share with her. I've always had to share a bathroom with my brother so it hadn't even occurred to me that this is something M might be unused to. \n\nBut I'm still mad that M tried to make the fact that I was more comfortable sharing a room with my brother than I was with her into something I should feel bad about. Like, he's my twin. We shared a room until we were 11.

A woman\u2019s menstrual cycle can often be an emotional and sometimes vulnerable time for many women. You\u2019re in incredible pain, you don\u2019t feel like yourself, and you just feel\u2026.blah. When I got them, I sometimes didn\u2019t even feel comfortable around my father. \n\nDefinitely tell her why you didn\u2019t want to share a room with her but, still be polite about it. Tell her something like, \u201clook, I\u2019m sorry about not switching with your brother. I really didn\u2019t understand your feelings. I still don\u2019t really but, another reason why I didn\u2019t want to share a room with you is because-you\u2019re not-the best roommate.\u201d Give her the reasons and why and, IF everything remains civil, maybe come up with solutions.\n\nIf she needs music, put Bluetooth earbuds in(there are some good cheap ones), and set the phones timer, to turn off the music. If she needs light, she can bring a nightlight. There are some really beautiful ones out there, that are just great. I actually own a couple! One is a moon light and It comes in three sizes. It has a remote and is also touch activated. It can turn multiple colors, shades, and you can also adjust the brightness, AND it has a timer! I love the thing. I use it with my dogs too.

I AM an adult (20s) who gets a menstrual period and readily share a room with my older brother on vacations/holidays as needed if his wife isn't with us.

OP mentions the cousin not cleaning hair out etc etc on the previous trip so I assume this means the siblings in a room get one ensuite.", "NTA.

Also concerned about what she thinks is involved with sharing a room with a sibling.\nIf you desired, for the next family trip, you could discuss beforehand that you want most of the lights off and that one or both of you would use headphones/earplugs.", "NTA", "NTA at all, she actively made your holiday worse last time, and this time is blaming you for stuff that was out of your control.", "Having been a 17 yr old girl (many moons ago), I can hazard a guess. She might leak during the night and her brother would likely see the blood stain on the sheets or her pajamas. Maybe she thinks he doesn't really know about periods and doesn't want to have to explain it to him, or maybe she knows full well that he'd be grossed out or give her a hard time about it. Whatever the specifics are,  M apparently doesn't want her 12 yr old brother seeing evidence that she's on her period which is much more likely to happen to if they're sharing a room."]}
