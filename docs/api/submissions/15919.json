We stayed at an airbnb. It was a nice house, and the \"kids\" i.e me, my twin, and my cousins 'M' (17f) and her brother(12m) had two rooms, both with an ensuite to share between us. I wanted to share with my brother, but M said she wanted to share with me. This was the last thing I wanted. \n\nM and I shared a room last holiday and it nearly drove me mad. She keeps the lights turned on all the time, even when sleeping, doesn't clean her hair out of the drain after showering, and needs music to fall asleep. I need silence and darkness to sleep. That holiday was horrible for me in terms of sleep. \n\nWhen I insisted on sharing with my brother, M pulled me aside and told me she was on her period and didn't want to share a room with her brother because of that. But I didn't understand why that was a problem, and I really wanted to be able to sleep so I said no. \n\nThe rest of the holiday was her saying how weird it was that I was okay with sharing a room with my brother even though I'm almost an adult. \n\nAfter we all went home, M messaged me and said that she had a horrible time because of me. She told me because she has her own room and bathroom at home, she was uncomfortable sharing one with her brother especially when she was on her period. I ask her why she didn't tell me this part while we were there, because I probably would have changed my mind if I had known. She says she told me she felt uncomfortable, and that should've been reason enough for me. I haven't replied to her yet. \n\nNow I feel bad because I hadn't taken that into account when I said I didn't want to share with her. I've always had to share a bathroom with my brother so it hadn't even occurred to me that this is something M might be unused to. \n\nBut I'm still mad that M tried to make the fact that I was more comfortable sharing a room with my brother than I was with her into something I should feel bad about. Like, he's my twin. We shared a room until we were 11. I'm okay sharing a room with him for a few days while we're on holiday.", "created_utc": 1682697882, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/131yxag/aita_for_sharing_a_room_with_my_brother_instead/", "score": 58, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You leave the lights on and that's not fun for me. You play music all night and I can't sleep in that atmosphere. Again - not fun for me.

Not with you or your brother, but with her.  I know I learned about periods and all that jazz at 10, I'm sure her brother has at least heard about it.
