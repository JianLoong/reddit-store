Once I received mine I asked her whether or not she also sent one to her biological dad. They are mostly estranged and she sees him maybe every once year. \n\nOur mom and her dad got together when I was around 2 and separated when I was 10 (my sister was 3) after her dad got sent to prison. He was in prison for quite some time and didn't pay my mom any child support for his 3 kids even after he got out.\n\nHer dad was pretty much the only dad I ever knew (I've never met my own bio dad), but that includes a lot of bad memories. She only thinks of him like a guy that was never around whereas I remember him as aggressive, drunk, controlling, and him breaking my mothers heart. Myself and my siblings grew up in poverty because this man got himself sent to prison.\n\nI hate him and have refused to see him up to this point. My sister and one of our brothers have been trying to have a relationship with him the last few years. Which o me seems pointless and I don't support it. \n\nI told her if he is at the wedding I won't be there. As much as I want to support her on such an important day I know if I have to be around that man I will cause a scene. I know myself well enough that I won't be able to keep my anger in check.\n\nShe's understandably upset with me that I would make her chose and has said at this point we both remain invited and that she hopes she can convince me to still attend.\n\nYesterday her partner messaged me to basically call me a massive asshole for upsetting my sister and creating a problem for nothing. I think it's unfair for him to judge me considering he doesn't know the history. Am I allowed to have boundaries with the man that ruined our family and all my siblings childhoods?

So the real question is, which one is stronger, the love for your sister, or the hate for your stepdad?", "YTA. If you can\u2019t prevent yourself from causing a scene in the presence of someone you strongly dislike, you need intensive anger management. Don\u2019t go if you really won\u2019t be able to prevent it, but take it as a sign that you need to treat this as an emergency mental health issue causing you to let down important people in your life.\n\nYou literally don\u2019t even have to speak to him.

She should invite you both and you can both suck it up for one day because you love your sister, or you can make the choice not to go and risk hurting her deeply. But do not do this sh\\*t.", "YTA. It\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about your sister. It\u2019s clear you still have issues about your childhood, but get over yourself and think about your sister. If you actually cared about her you wouldn\u2019t be making HER wedding about YOU.", "Hmmmm.  YTA.\n\nYou determined that he was invited.  Instead of declining the invitation you decided to give her an ultimatum.

Ultimately, I decided it's easier to tell you to seek professional help. This is not healthy. \n\nThis could destroy your relationship with your sister. She'll either resent you for not showing up or she'll resent you for making her choose", "YTA - you should see a therapist for your anger issues\n\n\"I know if I have to be around that man I will cause a scene.

I don't blame you for not wanting to be around your stepfather, but you're saying that if he also attends, you'll definitely cause a scene, and you \"know yourself well enough that you won't be able to keep your anger in check.\" It is not OK, and not a \"boundary,\" for you as an adult not to take responsibility for keeping negative emotions in check when necessary.

Totally understand you want nothing to do with this man and don\u2019t want to see him, but how big is the wedding? Can you be in the same space as him and just not interact for the sake of your sister?

I\u2019m not making my son deal with that so I suck it up and deal with the man who stole my wife. I hate it so much but I do it because I love my son more than anything. I know this is apples and oranges, but the moral is, if you love your sister, suck it up. I can\u2019t say y ta because that would invalidate your feelings. You\u2019re allowed to have feelings. I would just find a way to get through it, pretend he\u2019s not there, and support your sister.", "YTA.\n\nIt's your sister's wedding. She should get to decide if she wants her father there. You have no control over the guest list. Not only are you adding to the pre-wedding stress, but you're making her choose between her father and her sister.\n\nIf you can be mature about it and be there tu support your sister, then do that. Attend the ceremony and eat dinner and leave before you even interact with the man. Your sister will end up resenting you if you're not there for her during the most important day of her life so far.", "Sorry but YTA it\u2019s her day not yours.

You may hate the man but she may have different feelings about it.\nUnless she sit you next to him at the wedding I don\u2019t see why you can\u2019t attend, pay respect to your sister and simply avoid him. \nAs for many point you listed, living in poverty and yadda yadda yadda\u2026 well you have 50% to blame on him 50% on your mother.

The only way you are really an asshole is if you push for to un-invite him or keep trying to discuss it and have her see him the way you do.

If it's too painful for you to be in his presence, then bow out. It sounds like either way, there will be drama (you'll be seething if you're in the same room with him, or your absence will be noted and that will be drama). It sounds like staying away would be less drama, so stay away for her sake, explain why, and wish her well on her special day.
