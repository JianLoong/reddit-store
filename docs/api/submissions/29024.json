While he didn't do anything to you, these situations often build resentment between the sick and the healthy siblings due to the parents unequal care.

Maybe try to find your way back to them slowly?", "So, speaking as the heavily disabled sibling who took up a lot of her parents' time early on, I'm sorry for you.  That really sucks.   That super duper sucks. It like impossible to quantify sucks.\n\nIt may help you to really like bring into your heart that George didn't choose this and didn't enjoy it. I know because I didn't choose my lot in life and I didn't enjoy all that extra attention. There were so many days and years I would have given anything for my parents to be obsessed with my sibling and to be independent and not need anything from them.  And the fact that I couldn't for so much of my childhood felt like a curse in the same way I'm sure your lack of attention and concern felt like a curse.  \n\nProbably the only person who could have understood that curse if he was mentally capable of it is having a funeral. And you need to ask yourself if your relationship with him (whatever it was growing up) is something that celebrating at a funeral would be worthwhile for you to do.  This aspect isn't about your parents, it is about your sibling relationship.  And keep in mind when you're thinking about this, you didn't just leave your parents behind and ignore them, you did the same to George, and I don't know how mentally with it he was, but he may have wanted to see you and have a relationship with you all those years.  OR at least to make amends to whatever degree he was capable. I know that if I somehow knew my sibling didn't attend my funeral because of holding so much hatred towards me for something I never chose and wished away constantly, well, I'd be pretty damn upset. Of course I'd be dead, but to know they were carrying that much poison for me and the weight of that, I'd hope they'd eventually let it go, you know. Eventually put that burden down and just, be at peace.  \n\nAs for your parents, no one tells anyone how to deal with this bind of a horrifically disabled child.  Everyone's doing their best and usually, it's not great because this is one of those damned if you do, damned if you don't situations.  People in the comments are saying one parent could have been with you, and theoretically that's true...but what if while Dad is at your high school graduation, George dies in the hospital and Dad wasn't there.  That's a pretty awful weight to carry for you and your dad, right?  There wasn't a good answer available to them or to you. That's what makes these kind of things so awful, there's not a win available to anyone, not to you, not to George, and not to your parents.  \n\nThe only possible win is now. You can all choose to forgive each other for this tremendous awfulness.  You can just let it be the tragic past.   It doesn't have to dictate your future.  It doesn't have to be the curse that took down the family and destroyed it.  It can just be the unspoken tragedy of living.  And if you want it to be that, if you want to try to move forward and have the family that was denied to you in childhood, you may want to go to that funeral and finally come home.  \n\nBut, I totally get it if you don't.

That being said NTA", "NTA. Your brother\u2019s funeral is not going to give you closure between you and your parents. There\u2019s like a 99.9999% chance that one of two things happens both at the funeral and going forward.

There\u2019s maybe a one in a million chance that your parents do the right thing which is to apologize that they weren\u2019t there for you, acknowledge the hurt that they caused, recognize the ball is in your court for any reconciliation and that they are open to talk again whenever you are ready and under whatever conditions you choose, but they won\u2019t press beyond that. But like you have to understand that it is far more likely that your parents call you out as a ungrateful child and sibling who abandoned your brother at the first opportunity than it is that you get anything positive from them.\n\nThe closure that **might** be available would be if you harbor any resentment or guilt toward your brother. Maybe there\u2019s a part of you that blames him for your parents\u2019 actions, or questions whether he needed the level of care that he did. Maybe there\u2019s a part of you that feels guilty about not spending time with him after you left for college.

IMHO, this is all much bigger than the funeral.\n\nYour family was dealt a terrible blow that affected everybody deeply. Nobody grows up learning how to handle such an awful situation as a profoundly disabled child. Your parents had to wade through many years of guilt, grief, fatigue, financial issues, worry, time, effort, tragedy, etc. What they went through is unimaginable. They were forced to prioritize your disabled brother over you, and while you may not realize it, I'm sure they felt an incredible amount of guilt over being forced to put you second. \n\nAs a kid, you could only see it from your perspective, I get it. You missed out on a lot because of your brother, and it is natural to have resentment towards him. We all hope we could react with grace and understanding, but children especially may not have the coping skills to handle a situation that is an enormous challenge to adults. Nobody can blame you for your anger.\n\nThe thing you HAVE to remember, is that NONE of this is ANYONE'S fault. This isn't one of those cases we often read about on this forum, where a parent deliberately favors one sibling over another. Your parents didn't ask for this, you brother didn't ask for this, and you didn't ask for this. It was a terrible situation that was thrust upon your family, and they did the best they could without any preparation. The result fell short of what you needed from your parents, and now you are harboring extremely deep resentment over it, and that's a valid, understandable reaction. \n\nWhat you need, more than advice about going to the funeral, is a good therapist. The fact that you are still harboring such resentment toward your parents is evidence that you still care, even if you tell yourself and others that you don't. With your brother gone, you have an opportunity to repair your relationship with your parents. They've lost the child they were obligated to prioritize, and now they can turn that attention to the child they were forced by fate to neglect. A therapist can help you process your complex feelings, and start getting a normal relationship with your parents for the first time in your life. Your therapist might even want to have sessions with all three of you. \n\nBut it isn't just about your parents. Most importantly, a therapist can help you work through the resentment that drives your very existence.

What? Like, I can understand a 16 year old feeling this way, but OP is 28. It just seems OP never thought about this situation from anyone else's perspective. And there's virtually zero sympathy for her brother. I feel bad for OP and her family and perhaps this situation exacerbated this in her, but she sounds incredibly self centered and entitled.

On one hand, they failed OP by neglecting them to focus on their sick kid, but on the other hand they had to put some energy into taking care of George\u2019s medical needs bc it\u2019s a parents duty to make sure their kids are healthy and to tend to a child\u2019s medical needs if they\u2019re not.

I think a lot of people don\u2019t always realize they\u2019re a lot of trauma there.

It's your parent's fault for not being there for you. \n\nI know more than one family dynamic like yours where the ill or disabled sibling required more attention than the other but the non ill or disabled child is not resentful of their sibling and are equally involved. These are always in situations of the younger sibling being the ill one. \n\nThe only differences I can see from the little information on the post (I cannot know all the intricacies of your life and family dynamics) is perhaps living with different perspectives towards the situation. \n\nIt's one thing if the parents are not apologetic for prioritizing one sibling over another in situations of emergencies or health crisises and it's completely another situation if they are just choosing to stay at home with your brother because he wouldn't feel comfortable at your events. \n\nThe role of the parent is to be there for their children and I could not blame them for automatically prioritizing the child that is ill and disabled when it's potentially life or death. The unfortunate circumstance is that they unintentionally neglected you. \n\nIdeally they would have tried to prioritize spending time just with you or having at least one parent at your functions but I don't know what type of situation your parents lived. If your brother required both parents present to keep from being a problem or to keep calm etc. I don't know what their work schedule is and how stretched for time they are. \n\nHaving a chronically ill and disabled child is massively time consuming. Many parents who have a disabled and ill child as their first would choose not to have more children because they wouldn't have the time to give them the attention they need. \n\nUnless your brother was adopted, they did not choose to have a child that would negatively impact your life. If I were you I'd try to be more understanding towards my parents despite your feelings being completely valid. \n\nI was somewhat neglected emotionally and time wise by my parents because I have severe ADHD and learning disorders and I required a lot of assistance with my homework and a lot of emotional support. But my parents were exhausted and their time was incredibly limited. We moved 4 times before I was six desperate to find better job opportunities for my Dad to financially support the family. I have three younger siblings all two years apart from each other who needed attention because...they were young kids. \n\nOthers might say, they should have waited before having kids but my parents waited 6 years after marriage before having me. My mother was nearly 30 and it was during the recession but my parents always wanted 4 kids. They went ahead having kids while they could, while they were young enough to keep up with the physical demands and they worked and hustled to provide for us. The hope was the economy would change and they wouldn't be stuck hoping for a change to come and the time to have children pass. I do not resent my parents for having children after me. Truth be told, I was only diagnosed with my conditions after the age of 7 when all my siblings were already born so they had no way of knowing that I was going to require more attention. \n\nThey did try to support me when it came to school such as educational after school programs and a tutor for a time but most of these things were stuff they were not present for because they had to look after the younger siblings at home. \n\nI cannot fault my parents for not noticing I was struggling because my grades were always good but they thought I was just very sensitive when I explained how difficult things are for me. \n\nMy parents are neurotypical and sometimes a little Spock like. There's a disconnect emotionally between us but especially intellectually where they just cannot understand how my brain works. \n\nIt was not until I burned out of 4 years of college and had both a mental health crisis and physical health crisis that I think it dawned on my parents just how much I depend on them and how ill equipped I was and am for living on my own. \n\nHaving good grades is not proof that one can live effectively as an independent adult when your executive functioning is non existent. The rest of my siblings are becoming effective adults and starting their lives, families and careers and here I am at 28 completely stuck in a rut realizing that it's almost too late for me because certain behaviours, therapies, habits etc should have been ingrained into me in childhood so that I could thrive as an adult. \n\nMy parents are finally realizing that I need much more support and they are trying to give it but they are still very busy working jobs and it feels like it might be too late sometimes. \n\nBut I do not resent them because I could see from a young age just how utterly exhausted they were and I cannot blame them for noticing every little thing. If I felt neglected I tried to say so to my parents. I spoke up. \n\n\nIt was not your brother's fault for your parents neglecting you and it's not entirely your parents fault either. I'm not saying it's your fault. But sometimes life circumstances are just not win win. There's no such thing as a perfect family or perfect parents and not all parents can function as experts of balance and be 100% for both children simultaneously. \n\nI would implore you to find room in your heart to find a little understanding and a bit of forgiveness towards your parents. I cannot believe they were completely malicious in their treatment of you and I doubt it was their intention to neglect you. Try to find a little room in your heart to acknowledge that. \n\nBut more importantly, even if you cannot forgive your parents...find love and forgiveness for your brother who is completely innocent. He wasn't intentionally stealing all of their time and attention. I'd suggest for  you to go to his funeral, not for your family but for you and for him. \n\nBitterness and resentment is a poison and holding onto it is slow suicide. I'd highly recommend you consider therapy to work through your feelings so that you do not have to suffer further. It's not about justifying your parents actions or forgiving them for their behavior, the therapy is for you to learn to let go and move on without it bringing you down for the rest of your life. \n\n\nI would also suggest you consider the possibility of reconciliation with your parents or even family therapy with them to move forward. Even if they dropped the ball for the first 20+ years doesn't mean they can't try to make it up to you unencumbered by the burden of your brother. Your brother is gone but you are not. \n\n\nOnce again, I'm not trying to dismiss or invalidate what you went through but healing and moving forward is always possible if you give it a chance.", "Funerals are not for the dead.

It sounds like you might. \n\nYour parents gave you many, many things that your brother was not allowed (cello, which is very expensive, orchestra practice and performance, softball, independent study, academic achievement, A HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION, fiscal independence) and you have made your mark in the world since then.\n\nThey may not have been as available to you as they wanted, but it is clear that they gave you vastly more than the average child, nonetheless. \n\nGo to the funeral.

Everyone seems to skim over the fact that he died at 25. That's really young and if he had similar complications throughout the whole time that were life-threatening then it would make sense. And OP your parents will probably try and use this to build a relationship with you but that is totally up to you. You wouldn't be an AH but it seems like you don't care about anyone involved in this situation including George and its almost as if he is a small target of your resentment.

I work in social care and see family dynamics like this a lot and it's so sad. I don't think bad of you, you're parents raised you both in a way that fed into these feelings and an open conversation down the road about the impact that this has had on you is absolutely appropriate. Missing his funeral isn't a great way of sticking it to them and it won't make you feel good about yourself moving forward. Whatever you decide do it for you and your brother. Whether that's something done in his name/memory like visiting a favourite place of his on your own or with your partner or similar, or attending his funeral, an opportunity to say goodbye to a family member does give you an opportunity to heal.

Come on now.", "He\u2019s dead at 25 id bet those hospital trips were pretty damn serious.", "As long as OP doesn't blame the brother for their neglect, OP isn't the asshole. However, the parents likely didn't mean to be neglectful to OP. They just had to give their attention to the ill brother, and as a result, OP suffered. This isn't an excuse for the parents, nor am I saying that OP is obligated to try to repair the relationship. It's just important to keep in mind that the parents may not understand fully what they inadvertently subjected OP to, and a conversation should have taken place ages ago.", "Well that\u2019s not really a determination you can make. Relationships evolve over time, and OP may decide to keep this door ajar in case she wants to open it in the future, and that\u2019s okay too.

I didn't get that impression from OP's post either.", "Concentrating on one child shouldn't mean completely abandoning the other.  Of course a sick child or one with special needs is going to require more time and attention but I have a hard time believing the sick child needed so much that they couldn't spare any for OP.  Not even the most basic emotional support or connection.", "Easily? \n\nHow do you know that both parents were with the child at the hospital and that the other one wasn\u2019t working to continue to provide insurance benefits to their child with significant medical needs?", ">Did every single hospital visit require both present, every rough day, every sleepless night excuse for why they couldn't go to one of OPs thing.\n\nWelcome to the life of a parent with a terminally ill child, OP's parents were likely in a lose-lose situation no matter what they did.\n\nEspecially depending on the scenario, was one parent a full-time caretaker? Or were they both juggling jobs to pay for George's medical needs?\n\nDid they ***ever*** go to events? They really can't be faulted if 1 parent was planning on going to the event, only for George to have a medical emergency while the other was working. PTO only goes so far.\n\nIn reality, OP's parents didn't have many options in this situation:\n\n* Adoption\n   * Give George up for adoption and pray he's not neglected, sexually abused, physically abused, or purely used for a check as many special needs children experience\n   * Give OP up for adoption once George's needs become too much to give both children their needs, OP holds life-long resentment and has the risks of living in a foster home\n* Parents stop focusing on winning a losing battle with George\n   * They stop working so many hours to pay for anything beyond hospice for their son(although that is likely just as expensive) so they can make it to their daughter's events rather than work\n   * They stop staying with George every time he goes to the hospital in order to go to OP's events, leaving a nonverbal patient without a proper caretaker to communicate his needs\n   * They dump George in a long-term care facility, and visit him every now and then because they'll still be working long hours to cover the costs", "These are hospital visits for a seriously sick child (bite they\u2019re dead at 25). How are you supposed to sit at a cello recital while your other kid is dying in the hospital?", "Life doesn\u2019t just go back to normal for people impacted by disability though. I say this as a chronically ill person. My house is a mess - because I\u2019m in pain every day and can\u2019t afford a cleaner, there is no alternative. I can\u2019t work because the pain affects my concentration and I would just get fired, no alternative to that. Things don\u2019t just get easier if your living with or caring for someone with a disability - if anything they get worse as the disability progresses. Not going to a cello performance isn\u2019t child neglect. We don\u2019t know if the parents tried to make it up to them when they could, which is what I think they should have done. Someone\u2019s life should always be prioritised, disabled or not. When you or someone very close to you becomes disabled, your entire life is impacted by it unfortunately, and there aren\u2019t work arounds like everyone would like to think.", "They let their daughter have a life, which is more than they had. They couldn\u2019t be there for a lot of it but they give her as close to a normal childhood as they could  \n\nAnd given how young the brother died I have to assume it was generally that serious.", "\"Did they feed her?\"\n\nLol, setting the bar pretty low, huh?", "At the very least, they fed her. Clothed her. Paid the bills for her to partake in activities like softball and playing the Cello. OP says they missed a lot of her games, but she never claims they missed all of them. Which would mean that they were putting in some effort. She doesn't mention at all how life at home was. She does mention that her parent contacted her, trying to get her to visit but only on \"special events.\"\" If she moved out at eighteen that would mean she spent ten years blowing them off but is somehow upset that they didn't try to get her to visit often enough.\n\nHer parents must have struggled so much to \nprovide for both of their children. If this is the states those hospital bills would have been astronomical, even with insurance. Yet they were still providing her with a Cello and presumably the lessons to go with it.", "Yes, one parent could\u2019ve came to the graduation\u2026 however, we don\u2019t know how serious his condition was in the hospital at the time. Were they concerned he may not make it? I wouldn\u2019t leave a child\u2019s side for any reason if things were dire\u2026 and my other children would definitely understand and would probably want to be there also\u2026 including skipping a graduation", "Jesus fucking Christ. He was still her brother, regardless of his condition. This is some heady fucking ableism here.", "I think it can provide closure but it won\u2019t for everyone. OP knows better than anyone if it will help him.", "Closure is a weird thing.  I have an aunt that died from Cancer during COVID and we were not able to go to any kind of funeral because she was in a different country too.  I didn't have a relationship with her, only when I was younger, she was one of my favorites.  But life happens and I never saw her again for like 30 years.  For a good year, I questioned if she was alive or had passed.  Since I had no \"memory\" of her funeral, or casket or viewing her body in a casket, I had nothing to grasp on to.  It was really weird.  She had been sick, then gotten better, then sick again, then better, then sick with COVID then better. So it was hard to keep track where it left off.  Also know that I had lost 3 other family members and 1 other extended family to COVID and other various cancers all in the space of less than 2 years. Those whom I was able to see a funeral for were easy to remember what had happened, the others were like a distant dream that I just wasn't sure about and I would have to think hard about. I had to ask my mom for confirmation about her sister passing away.  So I guess I can understand how funerals may provide a solid place to look back on.", ">I have a difficult relationship with my own mother because of some choices she made while raising me. I love her, and we're working on it (mainly on her accepting that even if she felt she had no other option, her actions still affected me negatively. I'm working on accepting that some of the things she did, she did have to do despite it negatively affecting me, and not to hold those specific things against her) but I've heard more than enough of 'I did the best I could' or 'I didn't have any other options'. There are always other options when it comes to neglecting your child.\n\nI feel like I could have written this. \ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffb", "I\u2019m sorry but there\u2019s a massive difference between parents picking a favorite and parents having to care for a sickly disabled child l", "> Wee bit late to have that realization.\n\nThe parents asked OP to return at holidays and whatnot after they left home, and OP repeatedly declined. It reads like OP neither went completely no-contact nor had it out with the parents, either of which might have given them the shock they needed. \n\nThat's understandable from OP, but the point is the parents didn't just go, \"Fuck, thank goodness THAT kid is out of our hair forever!\" and forget they existed. How much energy do you put into someone treating you like a Jehovah's Witness at their door when you have a dying kid to still take care of? They DEFINITELY should have done better, but we can't be sure they never had a clue or a hope with OP.", "I totally agree.  Some people are blessed with good families, others\u2026. Well\u2026.", "She lives 3 hours away- so 6 hours round trip. Not including the service and any stops along the way. Not saying she should go or not-that\u2019s a question that only OP can answer. But this is a big time commitment.", "This was me this actual past weekend. I didn't go. I was back and forth on it, because I didn't know if I felt okay taking space from someone else (not actual physical space, that wasn't an issue) - I just didn't want to take anything from someone who was closer. Very few people knew our relationship, so I also worried that I would be an imposter. He was the most constant and close person in my life, much more than my family or friends, for five+ years, and filled me up in so many ways.\n\nI did intend on going, but then my dog care fell through, and I kind of felt like it was a sign, so I didn't try to get someone else. \n\nAnd yeah, I regret not going.", "This also occurred to me.  One of her parents could have made the effort to attend her school events.  Pure neglect on their part.  NTA", "Yeah, one of them could have broken away to watch her recital or go to her graduation. They had 2 kids and completely forgot about one. \n\nIMHO, she shouldn't go to the funeral. I fully expect her parents to turn to her and dump their grief onto her shoulders, then expect to be able to pick up their relationship where they left off. If OP wants to perform some kind of ritual to honor her brother, she can do it in her own way on her own time, without the weight of anyone else's feelings added to it.\nNTA. Do whatever serves you best.", "Family of four I know has a kid who is an absolute medical marvel she is still alive. They have three boys and either took the daughter or arranged for family to stay with her or split up and did one with the disabled child and one with the other kid(s) who had things going on. \n\nNot a single high school game was missed by both parents for their three boys. Meaning, at least one made it a priority to be there. Every time. They found a way. Their non-disabled children have never gotten as much one on one time. True. But their parents made sure to find a way to be present for them when they needed them present. Equity is not equality. They did their damn best to not turn their other boys into caregivers for their sister and make sure they never had a resentment that she took up time.  Now as adults they're all independent adults with lives and don't ignore their parents or sister. Aren't her caregiver.\n\nOne parent household is a totally different situation. But two parents, two kids? They could have done a majority of things by having one with one kid and one with the other. Trade off.\n\nHeck. One time, my older brother ended up hospitalized three hours from home at a children's hospital. My parents were driving six hours round trip to trade off being with me (one-two years) and my brother (three years). It was a week or two of him being there and them doing long hours to swap. They'd make the trade while I was at daycare and my older sisters were in high school.\n\nYou find a way, if you have two parents available.", "If you reread, it doesn\u2019t say they missed every cello performance or softball game. \n\nAlso, there\u2019s subtext in that participating in those activities requires time and money, driven to and from practices and rehearsals, etc.", "Because it has BEEN too little too late for a long while now, sounds like op cut herself loose as soon as she was able for her own sake. What makes anyone think op is going to go back home for this just to be berated for not coming sooner and not being sad enough etc etc.", "I am with you.  20+ years is enough.", "We don't know she was alone. Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles, family friends...I can't imagine my parents being at my graduation when my sibling is ill enough to need emergency care...", "Except the brother is gone, so OP will have to deal with the parents, and any other relatives that side with the parents against OP, and who lack empathy for what her life was like.", "The sibling is capable of providing exactly ZERO closure in his current condition. Funerals are for the living. This is 100% about the parents and the rest of the family.", "I agree, her brother could not help that he was disabled.  He didn\u2019t choose to have his parents isolate his sister.   I am sure he would have wanted his parents to love his sister if he had the choice.

Do the math.", "Yeah I feel for all of them", "The fact that they are guilting her with this just shows they still have no understanding of her \"invisible child\" status. An amazing amount of people refuse to acknowledge the horrible ways children are affected by having a medically demanding sibling take all their parents time and energy. I'd wager they want her at the funeral for appearances, and nothing more.", "seems like we are forgetting that this is not the parents funeral. I don't think the handicap disabled brother was discounting and disrespecting OP.", "Based on the description the parents didn\u2019t intentionally make the OP feel neglected. They had a special needs child that required a lot of care. Parents make mistakes. I\u2019m sure they did the best they could with what they knew at the time, and I\u2019m willing to bet if they could turn back time and make sure the OP got more attention then they would. I know what it\u2019s like to have a parent miss very important moments, and it is so painful and sucks. Especially when they showed up for my siblings special moments. Sometimes, for our own sake, we have to forgive and move forward. Mine didn\u2019t even miss my special moments due to medical emergencies, mine missed special moments because they didn\u2019t feel like taking off work or didn\u2019t want to park so far away for my graduation.", "Expect nothing from others and you\u2019ll never be disappointed.", "The parents probably also worked a lot. Hospital bills aren\u2019t cheap even with insurance. OPs cello lessons wouldn\u2019t have been cheap either. I\u2019ve seen that several people paid $40 for half an hour of lessons. Seems as though they were trying to help OP get away from all the medical drama and made sure she wasn\u2019t missing out on activities and having a social life whilst they were busy dealing with things.", "Depending on the issue, sure. Life threatening physical complications and you think one parent is just supposed to wander off and let the other one ride it out solo?", "And yet, despite all that, here you are", "Spending money on their own children is the bare minimum of a parent's responsibility. To nurture and foster a strong relationship requires trust, love and care. That requires time. Time they didn't invest. They can come up with whatever excuses they want, but his childhood is long over and there is no love between them now. Action.
