As others have mentioned, therapy may help you deal with processing your childhood. You are absolutely NTA.", "NAH, but funerals are for the living. Your parents no doubt made heart-wrenching decisions when George needed care and they couldn't be there for you. They may regret it almost as much as you. This could be both an ending/closure and a beginning with your parents if you can see it that way. Not saying you'll ever be all warm and fuzzy, but after a mourning period for them, you may find they are thrilled to be able to travel, visit your city, and take an interest in your life. I agree with another poster who suggested therapy if you haven't already started. Maybe you can view them more as an aunt and uncle. IDK. Good luck, OP, whatever you decide.", "Meh. NTA, but I think you should go. \n\nYour parents fucked up. They should have figured out how to divide their attentions appropriately. You had a shitty childhood and it was not your fault, on any level. \n\nBut, it also was not George\u2019s fault. He could not help that he was mentally and physically disabled and required frequent hospitalizations. What a shitty hand to be dealt in life, right? Not his fault either, on any level. He didn\u2019t want that for himself. Given the choice between your circumstances and his, I think you (and all of us) would choose yours. \n\nYou were just two blameless innocents in this story. So, yeah, fuck your parents. But honoring George, and separating him from the actual bad actors in your mind, isn\u2019t a bad idea.", "NTA    Family is only family if you care about them. If you don't, then fuck 'em.", "NTA\n\nFor all of those \"emergencies\", one of the parents should have come to your events.  Both were not required to deal with him every time.   They chose to ignore  you at every opportunity  and created this resentment.", "You can do what you want. NTA", "NTA\n\nFunerals are for saying the last goodbye to the dead person and supporting the ppl they left behind. \n\nI understand why you don't want to support your parents, they never supported you so you resent them. You should seek help for this but for now thats enough to not go to the funeral. \n\nFor the last goodbye... well, you can do this any time. \n\nI would let your parents know you will not come to support them, but you will visit your brothers grave to say your last goodbye when you are ready to do so and it will be a thing only between you and him. This can be in a year or in 20 years, doesn't matter. There will come a day when you realise none of this was his fault and you will stop resenting him and be able/have the desire to visit his grave.", "I'm tempted to say this is a bit outside of AITA paygrade. \n\nIts your brothers funeral, and while he is the cause of your tough childhood its also not his fault at all.\n\nAlthough you may have never bonded with your brother, you may want to pay your respects to him regardless of your parents wishes.\n\nYour parents are obviously AH's... its annoyingly common for parents to neglect one of their children for another in situations like this. Even though they are making the request, try to be in the mindspace as if your brother is asking the question. Would you be sad if you didn't go to the funeral if your brother asked you to go?\n\nYou are NTA in this situation, but this comes with a sidenote to try and think about whether this is you getting back at neglectful parents or you having no emotional connection to your blood relatives at all. If its the latter, chances are you won't regret this later but best to be sure.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Funerals are to support the living and if you don't want to support your parents now, that doesn't make you TA.  It sounds like they didn't support you and didn't take much of an interest even after you left home and they didn't need to physically be at events.  Even your mother's statement that you're \"disrespecting \\[your\\] brother's memory\" is about him and not the clearly broken relationship between you and your parents.", "NTA. I don't think you'll feel better if you go. I think you'll just end up biting your tongue until it bleeds. If you do that enough, you may end up blurting something out that you'll regret. Feel free to skip it. All of this may not have been your brother's fault, but the people who put you on the back burner again and again during your formative years and beyond shouldn't be expecting you to provide emotional support now.

Would you have preferred for your parents to attend sporting events for your physically well sibling or would you prefer your parents take you to hospital as your health was at risk...\nI think that there are many parents who struggle day in and out with children who are disabled. I assume that there were many events that they did turn up to, however they may not have been the significant ones you wanted. \nI don't think you will be TA but I think you may regret it later. And it may (if you chose to have children) shed some light on  the situation your parents were in. \nI assume that this is not what they wanted at all. Ideally they would have healthy children who would grow up and have families of their own. However this is the cards they were dealt. Sorry that you feel that you feel hard done by, but it doesn't sound like they wanted this to happen the way it has.", "NTAH.  I still find it sad that you resent your parents so much that you've cut off loving your own brother. I feel your decision may cause you great regret one day.

But the funeral, you need to go. So far you can say that they wronged you etc, BUT, missing the funeral will give them all the justification they need to never ack how they treated you.

You can be angry at your parents, but I don't see what your brother did wrong.\nAnd I guess your parents also feel and felt bad, whenever they couldn't go to your events because your brother needed attention.\nFrom the little info we got, it looks like they at least tried to make it better at the end (inviting you).", "YTA\n\nYou're selfish and you don't have the emotional range to understand your parents. This is not your fault as you were neglected and never shown the type of love you crave.\n\nDo you realize that you're hurt because they did not show their love for you properly and now that they say *we need your support*, you have denied them because of your hurt. You are letting your hurt rule your life and your decisions. \n\nOf course I understand all the N T A  votes. This sub tends to give a pass to people who react in a self preserving manner to the abuse of their parents. You were wronged and you're making decisions based on that hurt.\n\nDo you know why relationships are hard? Especially the good ones and the ones we want desperately to work. Because it takes massive effort from both sides. This is your chance to do something profound for your relationship with your parents. Do something hard and give all of your effort. In this way you will be working hard for yourself instead of complaining that you were second fiddle to a brother you did not love. If you want the love of your parents then go to them. Say I love you and say you hurt me. Then tell them how they hurt you and be very honest. Open your heart up and expose the piece of yourself that you guard. Trust is the key in hard relationships.\n\nI don't think you're an asshole. You sound torn and hurt.

Funerals are important to show up for, and you've just lost your brother,  but you barely mention him here beyond showing how annoyed you were that he 'got' all the attention. You clearly let resentment towards your parents turn him into a non-human in this scenario. Did you seriously never care about him? Did you only see him as a burden your parents should have ignored more? Did you choose to blame him for your anger for so long that now you can't even show up to his funeral?

Your brother did not ask to be born disabled. He didnt ask your parents to neglect you in the way they did. If he fell sick he didnt do so intentionally so you skipping his funeral because of the way your parents behaved is not fine at all.", "YTA if you skip it.

I give this response to anyone who is struggling with the death of someone they had a complicated or severely disturbed relationship with. The only factor to consider here, is *you*. Take everyone else out of the equation, and really focus on how *you* feel about it, what *you* could take away from (not) going, how *you* would feel about (not) going.\n\nIf you can find a reason for yourself to go, a reason that would bring you something, anything at all, that means something to you or would be helpful (or at least *not harmful*), then by all means, go. If you don't, then don't go. Ultimately it's a risk/benefit analysis you need to make; do the benefits (to you) outweigh the risks (to you)? That's a question *only you* can answer, and it requires a brutally honest conversation with yourself.\n\nIf the outcome of that conversation with yourself is that you feel better not going, and you are fine with that for your own sake, then you can find that closure that way. You will be able to look at yourself in the mirror and have peace with that.\n\nIf the outcome is, that you would go, for the reasons that you have decided for yourself, then please know that this doesn't equal you signing a contract. You are allowed to change your mind or leave at anytime you feel like. And be OK with that, too. You don't owe anyone an explanation.\n\nJust try to make peace with yourself, regardless of what your decision will be.\n\nGood luck with your decision, OP.
