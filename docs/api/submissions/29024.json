I feel confident enought to say this because as a sibling of a person with a very serious, debilitating and fatal illness I have had many conversations were it is clear that even sympethetic people struggle to grasp the toll it takes on you and your relationship.\n\nI once attended a camp for families where someone within the family had Huntingtons. One mum asked advice on how to handle her childrens relationship, one at the later stage of their illnes, one healthy, both adults. The healthy daughter refused to visit her ill brother at the care facility. The mum tried to be supportive of her daughters decision, but worried that after her brother died she would feel remorse. I know she wouldn\u2019t be open to hearing that her daughter probably would never regret her decision, so I kept quiet. But when she meantioned that her daughter had said that her brother had already died and she had not interest in visisting what remained of his living body I knew she was already at peace with her brother being gone and his physical death wouldn\u2019t change that. I knew because in the grieving process I was going through for my own sister the grief peaked far before her physical death. I know other family members who feel similair.

Your girlfriend and many other commentators here are advicing you to go, and they mean well and wants what is best for you. You shouldn\u2019t ignore their advice, but perhaps balance it out with the knowledge that most peoples experiences are different enough that even though they want to help they might not actually know what would actually be helpful in your situation. Do you think you would get anything out of going? If you are uncertain, then taking a chance and going might be worth it. But if you can\u2019t think of any benifit to going, then don\u2019t go.

Even with his challenges, were y\u2019all ever able to build a relationship of any kind?

Maybe try to find your way back to them slowly?", "So, speaking as the heavily disabled sibling who took up a lot of her parents' time early on, I'm sorry for you.  That really sucks.   That super duper sucks. It like impossible to quantify sucks.\n\nIt may help you to really like bring into your heart that George didn't choose this and didn't enjoy it. I know because I didn't choose my lot in life and I didn't enjoy all that extra attention. There were so many days and years I would have given anything for my parents to be obsessed with my sibling and to be independent and not need anything from them.  And the fact that I couldn't for so much of my childhood felt like a curse in the same way I'm sure your lack of attention and concern felt like a curse.  \n\nProbably the only person who could have understood that curse if he was mentally capable of it is having a funeral. And you need to ask yourself if your relationship with him (whatever it was growing up) is something that celebrating at a funeral would be worthwhile for you to do.  This aspect isn't about your parents, it is about your sibling relationship.  And keep in mind when you're thinking about this, you didn't just leave your parents behind and ignore them, you did the same to George, and I don't know how mentally with it he was, but he may have wanted to see you and have a relationship with you all those years.  OR at least to make amends to whatever degree he was capable. I know that if I somehow knew my sibling didn't attend my funeral because of holding so much hatred towards me for something I never chose and wished away constantly, well, I'd be pretty damn upset. Of course I'd be dead, but to know they were carrying that much poison for me and the weight of that, I'd hope they'd eventually let it go, you know. Eventually put that burden down and just, be at peace.  \n\nAs for your parents, no one tells anyone how to deal with this bind of a horrifically disabled child.  Everyone's doing their best and usually, it's not great because this is one of those damned if you do, damned if you don't situations.  People in the comments are saying one parent could have been with you, and theoretically that's true...but what if while Dad is at your high school graduation, George dies in the hospital and Dad wasn't there.  That's a pretty awful weight to carry for you and your dad, right?  There wasn't a good answer available to them or to you. That's what makes these kind of things so awful, there's not a win available to anyone, not to you, not to George, and not to your parents.  \n\nThe only possible win is now. You can all choose to forgive each other for this tremendous awfulness.  You can just let it be the tragic past.   It doesn't have to dictate your future.  It doesn't have to be the curse that took down the family and destroyed it.  It can just be the unspoken tragedy of living.  And if you want it to be that, if you want to try to move forward and have the family that was denied to you in childhood, you may want to go to that funeral and finally come home.  \n\nBut, I totally get it if you don't.

Nobody grows up learning how to handle such an awful situation as a profoundly disabled child. Your parents had to wade through many years of guilt, grief, fatigue, financial issues, worry, time, effort, tragedy, etc. What they went through is unimaginable. They were forced to prioritize your disabled brother over you, and while you may not realize it, I'm sure they felt an incredible amount of guilt over being forced to put you second. \n\nAs a kid, you could only see it from your perspective, I get it. You missed out on a lot because of your brother, and it is natural to have resentment towards him. We all hope we could react with grace and understanding, but children especially may not have the coping skills to handle a situation that is an enormous challenge to adults. Nobody can blame you for your anger.\n\nThe thing you HAVE to remember, is that NONE of this is ANYONE'S fault. This isn't one of those cases we often read about on this forum, where a parent deliberately favors one sibling over another. Your parents didn't ask for this, you brother didn't ask for this, and you didn't ask for this. It was a terrible situation that was thrust upon your family, and they did the best they could without any preparation. The result fell short of what you needed from your parents, and now you are harboring extremely deep resentment over it, and that's a valid, understandable reaction. \n\nWhat you need, more than advice about going to the funeral, is a good therapist. The fact that you are still harboring such resentment toward your parents is evidence that you still care, even if you tell yourself and others that you don't. With your brother gone, you have an opportunity to repair your relationship with your parents. They've lost the child they were obligated to prioritize, and now they can turn that attention to the child they were forced by fate to neglect. A therapist can help you process your complex feelings, and start getting a normal relationship with your parents for the first time in your life. Your therapist might even want to have sessions with all three of you. \n\nBut it isn't just about your parents. Most importantly, a therapist can help you work through the resentment that drives your very existence. You are probably feeling a lot of guilt as well, for not being as understanding as you probably know you should have been. You will never be truly happy until you address this issue, and the sooner you start, the sooner you can learn to release your anger, resentment, and guilt, and learn to forgive your parents, and yourself. After what you've all been through, your entire family deserves that.\n\nI think you should attend the funeral, if only because if you do someday repair the rift in your family, you may regret not going to the funeral. \n\nYou got dealt a very bad hand in life, but so did your parents. Try to stop blaming, and try to start understanding and forgiving. \n\nGood luck to you, and your family.", "I am very sorry for your lost.\n\nYou have right to mourn however you fell or not mourn at all.

I agree that not liking someone because they are challenged is wrong, but it doesn\u2019t entitle them to being liked or loved either.", "3 hours though..", "No, worst case scenario is that an old wounds that has already closed is ripped open and she has to start healing it all over again. The wound that she was not ever a priority for her family, that she never mattered to them. It can cost her decades in undone work that will now be harder to heal from.\n\nTHAT is the worst case scenario. Do you really think that's worth it? Is the parents worth yet more decades of her life? Is 20+ years not enough? How much is enough?", "Even making an honest effort to attend some of the OPs important events, would probably have helped so much. You can\u2019t reschedule a game, or performance, but you can certainly make up a Christmas Eve by doing something on Christmas Day. Even birthday parties can be tweaked and changed. I get how parents would want to do anything for their children, I certainly would for my son, but I don\u2019t get how they forget their other children. There\u2019s so much literature on these topics and we\u2019ve know mental health can be just as critical as physical help.", "Exactly. I have an aunt that I absolutely hate for many reasons. But she's a hell of a good mother. Her first child is born with down syndrome and a few other difficult medical conditions, in the sixties, in a country where it was normal to just leave him on the streets to die. Her husband bailed, her family turned their backs on her, but she never let her child, that I always known as my cousin. She met my uncle later, had more children, and never disregarded one over the other.", "And some parents *do* that but for some kids it will never be good enough. We are outsiders to an incredibly complex situation. We don't.knkw what they actually did or did not do.", "I was just trying to explain the thought process to the person I was answering, since they didn't seem to understand what people mean when they say funerals are for the living.\n\nHaving said that, though, while I'm not religious I was raised catholic and most of my family still is, and while they believe in the afterlife, it's also believed that that happens in heaven, not earth, and after you're dead stuff on earth doesn't matter to you anymore. (I suppose they do believe the dead can watch over us, but in a \"I want them to be happy and safe\" type of way, not in a \"I'll be upset if my funeral doesn't happen the way I want it to\" way. We've lost my grandma recently and even the most religious among us agreed the funeral was for us, not for her.\n\nWhat I mean is, I think even most people who believe in life after death don't think the spirit is hanging around the earth, inspecting their funeral.", "I mean like, do you want a list of names? \n\nIt\u2019s a thing that people do, fairly common practice as far as I\u2019m concerned, could be a cultural or regional thing tho. Same idea as when a friend loses someone you send them a card or flowers or food or something, you didn\u2019t know the deceased but you know that they are grieving so you try to support them.", "Missing games and concerts and graduation don't count as \"neglect\" in my book if you have a very good reason.  It doesn't sound like OP lacked for anything other than the parents time, so from a physical needs perspective, she was not neglected.\n\n>as a person with a severely disabled brother yes one parent could\u2019ve handled it themselves they just chose not to.\n\nSo, do your parents split up when your brother is critically ill and going to the hospital for emergency medical treatment? They'll go to your concert/graduation while worried sick that he might not make it out of the hospital alive?", "Nope, it means the child who gets completely neglected and punished for expressing any needs because fulfilling those needs is seen by the parent as stealing time and energy from the sick or disabled child.", "Fuck that they had 25 years. Only now they care because the other died meaning if he hadn't they'd never reach out until they guilt OP to become her brother's caretaker. \n\nThey deserve nothing from OP.", "If one kid is terminally ill regularly, then you have enough \"terminally ill moments\" to remember anyway. You don't need to attend everyone in case this one would be the last. In my family, one parent rushed to the hospital with the very sick kid, and my other parent took care of the other five kids. Being with the sick kid every single time it's ill is a luxury you can't have if you have more than one kid to care for.", "Kids yes, op is no longer a kid. A 16 yo wouldn\u2019t be an A H but someone nearly 30 is", "Yes you\u2019re allowed to be upset as a kid. But it doesn\u2019t take a genius to literally live with a mentally and physically disabled sibling and think for one second oh I understand their MEDICAL condition takes priority over my softball game. Be sad. But to hold it against your parents ok fine, but to not even visit your dying brother. Like I\u2019m sorry no excuse", "Yea but it\u2019s likely to give you perspective and maybe op should push therapy up their agenda. Seriously not going to your dying brothers bedside because your parents didn\u2019t go to your cello recital because they were sitting by his hospital bed?", "I agree. You can dislike whoever. But it\u2019s strange disliking a person who can\u2019t really do anything you know. Just seems like he resents his parents and did this to get back at them. Because if he doesn\u2019t dislike his brother then he was a huge asshole.", "3 hours of life where you can chalk it up to a road trip and dinner in your hometown with your girlfriend or a possible lifetime of regret.\n\n3 hours doesn't sound that bad to burn.", "Your point has merit in general. For this particular situation, however, we are given the facts (her parents neglected her because her brother\u2019s needs were overwhelming) as OP sees them. She is asking for judgment based on that information.\n\nBased on the details given, it sounds as though her feelings are justified.  Caring for a severely disabled child is incredibly difficult, I know (!), and even more so when trying to parent other children. It does sound like her parents failed her a good deal.", "Ty", "Are we reading the same post? OP's parents have wanted him back home for every special occasion, OP has refused to go. And they certainly aren't asking him to forgive them, they're asking him to attend a funeral. He doesn't have to. \n\nYou're projecting a lot of your own crap onto this scenario, clearly. OP is under no obligation to go to the funeral, or to forgive his parents. But to minimize the fact that his sibling was critically ill and is now dead feels insensitive to me. I mean you doing it, not him. \n\nSounds like you're a very black and white person. So yes, your kids will DEFINITELY be writing one of these posts one day. \"My parent is an unforgiving AH and we've been no-contact for 8 years\". And you'll have earned it. But it's never too late to discover nuance, to learn forgiveness.", "Why do they owe it to their parents to go to this funeral then?", "I feel you are simplifying what OP went through. I have a tough time blaming OP, or thr parents or brother.", "Do you actually think OP isn\u2019t going to his brothers funeral because his parents missed a cello recital\u2026?", "But this could also end very poorly for OP's Mental health. Its clear the family didn't give two shits about OP why should they have to go when they don't want to? I had so many people tell me when my dad died a decade ago I would regret not going to his funeral. I didn't go and I don't regret it in any shape way or form. He was a horrible and abusive person who deserved what happened to him. I refused to go and pretend that he was a good person to make someone else feel better.", "Unless you have had a life time of being Discounted  and Dis-respected .Then it\u2019s  3 more hours of their life stolen for no gain .If OP has/ had any affection for the sibling I would say go .Otherwise avoid going because all it will do is add kindling to the fire of rejection they have endure their entire life .", "Bro the fact they only wanted special occasions is a fact to save face to others. \"Look OP doesn't hate us we saw her for xmas.\" I see these stories everyday I log on reddit. They only want him at the funeral to save face yet again. These parents suck. You're the one that seems to be projecting as it's 2/3rds of your argument lol.", "Fucking hell redditors will find an excuse for anything \n\nAwful parents who clearly prioritised one child while ignoring the other? \u201cPaReNtInG iS hArD\u201d\n\nNo shit, that\u2019s why 99% of the time becoming a parent is a choice\n\nThis dude probably had an awful childhood and you\u2019re here with weapons-grade copium defending them \n\nHealing process, what healing process? These parents don\u2019t deserve a relationship with their remaining child.", "It\u2019s an AH move not to go to your siblings funeral. In itself, it just is. It seems like ops parents didn\u2019t neglect any of their extra curriculars so maybe op could be a tiny bit more grateful for the things their parents provided", "If op were 12 then this is normal resentment but most people gain perspective.", "His parents missed many significant events because they were at his medically complex brothers hospital bedside. I don\u2019t see any assertions of parentification, just parents making the decisions they could at the time."]}
