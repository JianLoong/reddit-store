I came to Canada many years before Alice and have been living in a house my parents paid for. That's why when Alice arrived four months ago, I invited her to stay with me. She paid rent but we never had a contract.\n\nIt started when she got a new boyfriend. She is head over heels for him (Kevin). She constantly invited him to my house without permission. He came and stayed for at least 6 days a week, sometimes overnight. \n\nI did have problems with Kevin staying in my house, but when I brought it up with Alice, she brushed it off and said he helped her adapt to this new life. He is Alice's only emotional support besides me. However, I discovered Kevin lurking around my house, especially near my bedroom and figurine room many times when he was around. \n\nIt happened a month ago when I got home from school. I didn\u2019t notice anything since all the doors were locked (even the door to my figurine room). Until I discovered some of my figurines disappeared. Neither Alice nor Kevin was at home, so I assumed I got stolen since Alice never comes into my figurine room.\n\nI called Alice, she didn\u2019t pick up but replied and said Kevin brought her to Ottawa for a surprise trip. I tried to explain that my figurines were gone, she asked if the house was broken into and told me to go check around. Alice didn\u2019t come back until two days after that, but she kept sending me pictures of her going out with Kevin in fancy places. For those two days, I changed locks, set up hidden security cameras, alerted my parents and was panicking and in an extremely distressed mood. \n\nNothing happened for two weeks, but Kevin decided to steal again. I saw him, with two other guys I didn\u2019t know lockpicking my figurine room door and coming out with my figurines through two cameras. I flipped out and called the police, basically got him arrested since stupid Kevin decided to go hang around. I believe he called Alice since she was home right after I did, crying and begging me to let Kevin go so we could talk. I literally showed Alice the evidence, but she still begged and said IT WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING. \n\nIt has been one week since Kevin was arrested, Alice kept going after me and demanded I let him go, and at one point I just lost it. We were fighting right in the middle of the night and I kicked her out of my house. \n\nSince then I have been receiving a lot of phone calls from her family, from Kevin\u2019s family and friends threatening me to have Alice back and drop the lawsuit I pressed on Kevin. They are calling me AH for abandoning Alice for some figurines. They say that I am not allowed to kick her out since she paid rent or they will sue. Right now when I am thinking back, Alice has no one besides me and Kevin, and she is literally sleeping on my patio every night without eating and showering. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683331969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13966c1/aita_for_kicking_my_best_friend_out_of_my_house/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You alerted her to his likely stealing and she didn\u2019t stop him\u2026 when he did it again she\u2019s asked you to drop all charges. The first time you half forgive (half, but not fully), the second time it\u2019s a big conga line singing NOPE NOPE NOPE.\n\n  \nHe brought other guys in, and they are handy with lock picks. Kevin isn\u2019t just a freeloading Hoover, he\u2019s a criminal\u2026 and he is stealing your stuff to fete his girlfriend. I\u2019d love to hear what the \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 is on this\u2026\n\n  \nGive her 30 days notice or whatever your legal requirements are - talk to a lawyer and do it ticketty boo legal. Leave your cameras up. Add some more \u2026 so she can\u2019t find them \u2026 You can add to that notice expectations about what she will pay and what conditions she is to leave the property in. Alternatively offer her a \u2018cash for keys\u2019 deal where you give her a small payout, and she gives you the keys and walks. Lawyer up for this, will be the best $300 you\u2019ll ever spend. \n\n  \nAnd take out a restraining order against Kevin so he isn\u2019t allowed in the house. Or get it a condition of his bail that he\u2019s not allowed/whatever it takes to make it that he\u2019s not legally allowed at your property again. Because if he is he\u2019s going to damage something, or take a lot more.   \nAnd sue the pants off him, for both lots of missing stuff. He\u2019s going to have a hard time proving he didn\u2019t do the first round when you have him lockpicking the second time\u2026 same modus operandi and all that shizznit.", "NTA, be sure to tell kevin youll drop the charges if the figures he stole before show up, and once they do, continue the lawsuit", "Yep, and anyone who has a locked figurine ROOM isn\u2019t collecting the freebies with Happy Meals. They will be serious $$$$.", "This is part of the reason leases are important. If she moved out already and didn't pay for the month their may not be much she could do at this point. If she hadn't left then she would have had more of a leg to stand on.", "Oh.. and another legal thought:   \nIf she was in any way aiding and abetting his illegal activities (did she give him the keys to the house? Did she give him alarm codes? How did he get in through the front door?)\u2026 then your \u2018lease arrangement\u2019 with her might be voided under her acting illegally\u2026. Check this with a lawyer too.", "Yeah, my assumption is that rent has been paid. If it hasn't, that's another story.", "NTA her attitude over her bf stealing from you is ridiculous. I would have the cops remove her from my patio", "NTA\n\nYou're not kicking her out for figurines, you're kicking her out for bringing a criminal to your home, defending said criminal when he committed a crime against you, and for violating your home, safety, security and trust. Don't ever let anyone convince you it was no big deal.", "NTA.  She let her boyfriend steal from you so she could benefit from the theft.  It\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll have any legal recourse as she didn\u2019t have a lease and taking you to court doesn\u2019t seem like an option for her.   Additionally, you could always get a restraining order against her for allowing her bf into your home to steal from you, as she was complicit in the crime.  I would also consider having her trespassed from your property.   You\u2019re not in the wrong and you don\u2019t owe her anything.", "NTA but I can't help thinking she was in on it and told him when you wouldn't be home.", "NTA This is not a misunderstanding. Alice doesn't care that he stole from you. She just wants Kevin back. It doesn't matter that stealing is a crime and she brought him to your house. She is taking no responsibility for any of this, not does she seem to understand in the future, he will probably bring her down with him. This is more than just taking something he saw laying around. He planned, and broke into your room and took things that did not belong to him. I would let her in but only until she can find another place.", "NTA. Explain that if she knew he stole the first batch and used the money to take her on an expensive vacation she could be charged as an accessory. At this point I think she might be because her wonderful bf might flip on her for a deal.", "YTA for kicking her out. Pressing charges against her boyfriend is for the best. If she can't stop complaining about that, give her thirty days notice to move out.", "NTA", "NTA. Screw her, that\u2019s NOT your friend. She\u2019s second fiddle to a common BURGLAR.", "NTA and ice could use 3 hots and a cot for her part in the thefts.", "NTA - And has Kevin turned Alice onto drugs? That's my first thought with her defense of him for BOTH times.", "Tell her you'll have her arrested for trespassing. She'll know you're serious. Pack up her stuff and give her a deadline to get it out of your house (in writing).\n\nTheft is grounds for immediate eviction in any jurisdiction, and she clearly knew about where the money came from. \n\nThen talk to the police about the harassment. It is witness tampering, but since some of the people harassing you are in another country, this might be hard to prosecute. However, telling the people involved that you have gone to the police about it should help.\n\nGood luck - definitely NTA.", "NTA.\nKevin is a thief and deserved to be arrested.\nAlice and his family see nothing wrong that he did.\nThey are defending a criminal while disrespecting you.\nAlive and her BF got what they deserved.\nCall the police on Alice for trespassing and sleeping on your porch and for the parents and friends for harassment and threatening you.\nThreats from people like this should be taken seriously", "NTA", "What kind of figurines? A picture of you figurine room would be helpful since my imagination is running wild", "NTA. You\u2019re not kicking her out over some figurines, you\u2019re kicking her out because she consistently chooses her low-life thief of a boyfriend over you - her long time friend who gave her a place to live. But I\u2019m curious to know how she could possibly think this is a misunderstanding. Was he just taking your figurines out for some fresh air?", "NTA. Alice can join Kevin in jail and keep him company. She will have food and lodging there.", "NTA and I think you should get a restraining order.", "NTA , she fucked someone that fucked around and found out and she found out a second time.", "NTA. It sounds like she was aware he stole them the first time and that the money he made from them was used to fund the trip to Ottawa. Also, based on the fact that you mention Ottawa,  I assume you are in Ontario. In Ontario,  if you share kitchen/bathroom as landlord/owner/family member of owner and she does not have her own, she does not have rights of a tenant according to RTA like should would if she was renting an apartment. She would be under the CTA instead and that can mostly be enforced if there is a written contract. Read up on it and as long as you are within your rights, call the police and have her trespassed and removed.", "NTA- Alice saw evidence of her thieving boyfriend and blew it off. She values the thief more than her friendship with you. And tell them if they try to sue you you're going to add Alice to the lawsuit maybe she told him how much everything was worth. Ask how he paid for that holiday in Ottawa", "NTA. Ask them to,explain to you exactly what the misunderstanding is.", "> *they are threatening you*\n\nYou need to call the police and the DA's office.  I think that this is called \"witness tampering.\"\n\nNTA", "Better yet, replace the figurines in the exact same condition. Something tells me that's a higher bar.", "Yeah I think she was in on it", "Hi there, thank you so much for the advice. Alice lets herself sleep on my patio even though I asked her to find a Airbnb or a hotel to sleep in. She has money to spend and I think she has a place to go already, but she always comes back and acts pitiful.", "Tenancy agreements are void when the tenant commits a crime such as this.   OP said friend allowed her BF to copy the key so she aided and abetted the crime of theft.  She has no tenant rights.", "Hi there, thank you so much for the detailed advice. I would be following through with my lawyer. Alice confessed to me that Kevin has a second key to the house WITHOUT my permission. She gave him the house key so he could go copy it. I am so done.", "That is just pathetic.", "Call police and trespass her from your property.  She\u2019s as much to blame as the thief boyfriend.  She knew where the money for her trip came from after the first theft.  Don\u2019t kid yourself.  My bff in college played the \u201chomeless\u201d card and I stupidly took her in.  She stole diamond and sapphire earrings from me.  I kicked her out and she did the same thing.  Tried to sleep in her car in my driveway and begged for blankets because it was \u201ccold\u201d (we lived in Florida).   I told her to give me my earrings back or fuck off and if she did neither I would call the cops.   Never heard from her again.", "Good luck. Sounds like this is going to be a bit of a messy ride. Spew bags and all!   \n\n\nHold on, and work through it legally so it\u2019s ruthlessly efficient. A lot of people think going to lawyers is expensive, but it\u2019s actually sensible because it cuts the long drawn out thing down dramatically \u2026 and that\u2019s worth it! Don\u2019t muck about trying to get damages out of her\u2026 you just want her gone ASAP\u2026 and damages via the legal process from HIM.", "Wowwww already we\u2019re NTA but that was so out of line of her and disrespectful of the kind thing you were doing for her", "You should have charges against Alice as his accomplice.\nI think I know how they were able to afford their little vacation, with stolen goods.\nShe\u2019s as bad as he is."]}
