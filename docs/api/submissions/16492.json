I came to Canada many years before Alice and have been living in a house my parents paid for. That's why when Alice arrived four months ago, I invited her to stay with me. She paid rent but we never had a contract.\n\nIt started when she got a new boyfriend. She is head over heels for him (Kevin). She constantly invited him to my house without permission. He came and stayed for at least 6 days a week, sometimes overnight. \n\nI did have problems with Kevin staying in my house, but when I brought it up with Alice, she brushed it off and said he helped her adapt to this new life. He is Alice's only emotional support besides me. However, I discovered Kevin lurking around my house, especially near my bedroom and figurine room many times when he was around. \n\nIt happened a month ago when I got home from school. I didn\u2019t notice anything since all the doors were locked (even the door to my figurine room). Until I discovered some of my figurines disappeared. Neither Alice nor Kevin was at home, so I assumed I got stolen since Alice never comes into my figurine room.\n\nI called Alice, she didn\u2019t pick up but replied and said Kevin brought her to Ottawa for a surprise trip. I tried to explain that my figurines were gone, she asked if the house was broken into and told me to go check around. Alice didn\u2019t come back until two days after that, but she kept sending me pictures of her going out with Kevin in fancy places. For those two days, I changed locks, set up hidden security cameras, alerted my parents and was panicking and in an extremely distressed mood. \n\nNothing happened for two weeks, but Kevin decided to steal again. I saw him, with two other guys I didn\u2019t know lockpicking my figurine room door and coming out with my figurines through two cameras. I flipped out and called the police, basically got him arrested since stupid Kevin decided to go hang around. I believe he called Alice since she was home right after I did, crying and begging me to let Kevin go so we could talk. I literally showed Alice the evidence, but she still begged and said IT WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING. \n\nIt has been one week since Kevin was arrested, Alice kept going after me and demanded I let him go, and at one point I just lost it. We were fighting right in the middle of the night and I kicked her out of my house. \n\nSince then I have been receiving a lot of phone calls from her family, from Kevin\u2019s family and friends threatening me to have Alice back and drop the lawsuit I pressed on Kevin. They are calling me AH for abandoning Alice for some figurines. They say that I am not allowed to kick her out since she paid rent or they will sue. Right now when I am thinking back, Alice has no one besides me and Kevin, and she is literally sleeping on my patio every night without eating and showering. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683331969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13966c1/aita_for_kicking_my_best_friend_out_of_my_house/", "score": 2257, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lawyer up for this, will be the best $300 you\u2019ll ever spend. \n\n  \nAnd take out a restraining order against Kevin so he isn\u2019t allowed in the house.

It\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll have any legal recourse as she didn\u2019t have a lease and taking you to court doesn\u2019t seem like an option for her.

She is taking no responsibility for any of this, not does she seem to understand in the future, he will probably bring her down with him. This is more than just taking something he saw laying around.

She stole diamond and sapphire earrings from me.  I kicked her out and she did the same thing.

Like are these people in some alternate universe where that's normal? I'd be reporting all these people for harassment and blocking them eventually. Everyone going down on this ship.", "The family threatening OP will go a long way to getting a restraining order for their protection. Something tells me they just seemed to expect these kinds of threats to work because maybe they used them on someone else and it worked soo well for them.", "This has just made me think about how terrifying it would be to hear outside your house at 2 in the morning \"Hi, lockpicking lawyer here\" out of a phone speaker", "Oh no. More than likely the getaway was funded by OPs stolen figurines. So Alice was also benefitting from the theft. He can't be a bad guy because he only stole and sold OPs silly figurines to do something nice for his girlfriend! /s", "I wonder if op has insurance. Maybe they had this idea OP would file a theft claim with no proof and would just get the money back from insurance or something. \n\nI am just so curious what the misunderstanding could\u2019ve been! I want to know what she would\u2019ve come up with", "I seriously doubt Kevin's still in jail for B&E. Also, OP doesn't get to decide when he gets let out, and why are people asking her to \"drop her lawsuit\" against him? This isn't a civil case yet, at least nothing OP has said indicates it. This is a mish-mash of legal tidbits thrown together for a silly light rage-bait post.", "Almost everywhere in the USA also has different protections for lodgers. Even in Chicago that has some of the most tenant friendly laws in the country, most of the laws have exemptions for lodgers.", "That\u2019s all I can figure the \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d could be. It\u2019s for a friend so it\u2019s not as bad!", "Quite possibly Kevin is threatening her to name her as an accomplice unless she gets you to drop charges, hence her current melodrama. Don't give in, though do get a lawyer's advice on evicting her...though I would orient requesting that advice based on how to legally keep her out, not let her back in and go through a 30 day notice 'legal eviction' - you will not feel safe and may not BE safe with her living with you and possibly willing to let Kevin - and possibly his more criminally experienced pals - back in to 'persuade' you that it really WAS just a big 'misunderstanding.'", "I hope you've changed your locks.", "They ( yes, they, because that trip that Alice was on was probably financed partly by your figurines and she absolutely new that he was stealing, that is why she didn't act horrified) wouldn't stop stealing until nothing is left in your figurine room. Call the cops and remove Alice from your patio.", "At least in Ontario (I don\u2019t know about other provinces), tenants have incredibly strong rights. You can\u2019t even kick them out at the end of a lease - it automatically goes month or month. Basically the only way to remove a tenant is for the owner or a small list of family members to move in for a year. However, if the renter shares a kitchen or bathroom with the landlord, then the tenant rights don\u2019t apply.", "I think they should give the money back (not legal advice just generally) but they shouldn't feel bad for the person who seemed so adamant to sick their whole family on them. They said those things, they told their family to do those things, and they won't apologise. This is their fault, and their retribution.", "NTA, but you **ARE** in legal danger. Yeah, you can't just kick a renter out, I state boldly having no idea what the Canadian Law is any more than I know Bird Law. I would bet though, if they have been there for months and paying you rent, you need notices to legally evict renters, involving courts and notices etc.\n\nSOURCE: This is the way of the U.S. which by almost every citizen protection measure lags behind Canada. I can't believe the US would be *more* protective of renters than Canada... that just don't click.\n\nProtect yourself from a Lawsuit OP. Do this correctly. You may need a Canadian lawyer."]}
