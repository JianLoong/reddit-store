{"id": 16492, "submission_id": "13966c1", "title": "AITA for kicking my best friend out of my house because her boyfriend broke in and stole my figurines?", "selftext": "Me (F21) and my best friend, Alice (F21), have been close for more than 10 years, we went to the same schools and study abroad (Canada) together. I came to Canada many years before Alice and have been living in a house my parents paid for. That's why when Alice arrived four months ago, I invited her to stay with me. She paid rent but we never had a contract.\n\nIt started when she got a new boyfriend. She is head over heels for him (Kevin). She constantly invited him to my house without permission. He came and stayed for at least 6 days a week, sometimes overnight. \n\nI did have problems with Kevin staying in my house, but when I brought it up with Alice, she brushed it off and said he helped her adapt to this new life. He is Alice's only emotional support besides me. However, I discovered Kevin lurking around my house, especially near my bedroom and figurine room many times when he was around. \n\nIt happened a month ago when I got home from school. I didn\u2019t notice anything since all the doors were locked (even the door to my figurine room). Until I discovered some of my figurines disappeared. Neither Alice nor Kevin was at home, so I assumed I got stolen since Alice never comes into my figurine room.\n\nI called Alice, but she didn\u2019t pick up but replied and said Kevin brought her to Ottawa for a surprise trip. I tried to explain that my figurines were gone, she asked if the house was broken into and told me to go check around. Alice didn\u2019t come back until two days after that, but she kept sending me pictures of her going out with Kevin in fancy places. For those two days, I changed locks, set up hidden security cameras, alerted my parents and was panicking and in an extremely distressed mood. \n\nNothing happened for two weeks, but Kevin decided to steal again. I saw him, with two other guys I didn\u2019t know lockpicking my figurine room door and coming out with my figurines through two cameras. I flipped out and called the police, basically got him arrested since stupid Kevin decided to go hang around. I believe he called Alice since she was home right after I did, crying and begging me to let Kevin go so we could talk. I literally showed Alice the evidence, but she still begged and said IT WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING. \n\nIt has been one week since Kevin was arrested, Alice kept going after me and demanded I let him go, and at one point I just lost it. We were fighting right in the middle of the night and I kicked her out of my house. \n\nSince then I have been receiving a lot of phone calls from her family, from Kevin\u2019s family and friends threatening me to have Alice back and drop the lawsuit I pressed on Kevin. They are calling me AH for abandoning Alice for some figurines. They say that I am not allowed to kick her out since she paid rent or they will sue. Right now when I am thinking back, Alice has no one besides me and Kevin, and she is literally sleeping on my patio every night without eating and showering. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683331969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13966c1/aita_for_kicking_my_best_friend_out_of_my_house/", "score": 25, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its possible that the eviction rules don't apply because you are her \"landlord\" and she lives with you. If they don't tell her she needs to reach out to whomever for funds & needs to leave your property with her things immediately. \n\nAs for the harassment, report as necessary to the proper folks.\n\nAnd I think it goes without saying that Alice knew how her little getaway was funded. That she has no one else local is not your problem nor your concern. She wanted you to let her thief of a BF off the hook and absolutely would have expected you to still allow him in your home. She made her bed, she can lie in it for eternity.\n\nNTA", "NTA he\u2019s a thief. It\u2019s simple and it doesn\u2019t matter if he stole figurines or prescriptions or cold hard cash. If she\u2019s letting him in and then he steals while he\u2019s there she\u2019s been inadvertently helping him and you need to protect your property. Theft and lax security was not a part of your rental agreement. Take her off the rent and I\u2019d at least say they owe you what the figures were worth to drop the lawsuit.", "NTA. Oh boy, this is rough. Kevin is a confirmed thief and they are threatening you even with the proof? \n\nBe careful.

Tell the people calling you to reimburse you for the figurines and you will drop the charges.  Shut them right up", "NTA he's a thief and she was defending him I would not want her in my house ether. hell she might steal for him if he asked you cant know NTA", "You not are \u201cabandoning \u201cAlice for some figurines, Alice decided that a lying thief was more important to her than where she lays her head at night. We all have to live with the consequences of our actions..Kevin has to live with his and Alice has to live with hers(choosing a looser over her living situation) I would take all the threats to the police and press charges on them also just block everyone it will give you peace of mind.", "NTA you have her and him every chance they deserved. They crossed a line that can\u2019t be uncrossed.", "NTA - Please stay safe. And press charges for sure.", "Definitely NTA.", "NTA. She's sympathetic with a their over her friends. You did the right thing.", "NTA do not let her back in. She knew he was stealing and supported it. Do not let her sleep on your patio.  She is not on the lease so get rid of her. She is not by our friend. Do not drop the charges", "Nta screw that mess, hold her responsible for her idiot thieving boyfriend.\n\nAnd make sure you start the process of getting her out permanently cause she's an enabler and will not change.\n\nDocument all the figures you have left and make sure her family knows they can take her in if they care so much.", "NTA. Read what you wrote", "NTA\n\nPress charges and get a monetary judgement as well. If Alice's family and Kevin's family are concerned that she has no place to live, they can take her in. \n\nYou aren't required to let her move back in when her BF was stealing from you and you had to kick her out. If she keeps sleeping on your patio, have her arrested for vagrancy. Do NOT let her back in to your place.", "NTA. Call the police because you are being harassed.", "So Alice has tenancy rights and you can't just have her sleeping on your porch.

You alerted her to his likely stealing and she didn\u2019t stop him\u2026 when he did it again she\u2019s asked you to drop all charges. The first time you half forgive (half, but not fully), the second time it\u2019s a big conga line singing NOPE NOPE NOPE.\n\n  \nHe brought other guys in, and they are handy with lock picks. Kevin isn\u2019t just a freeloading Hoover, he\u2019s a criminal\u2026 and he is stealing your stuff to fete his girlfriend. I\u2019d love to hear what the \u2018misunderstanding\u2019 is on this\u2026\n\n  \nGive her 30 days notice or whatever your legal requirements are - talk to a lawyer and do it ticketty boo legal. Leave your cameras up. Add some more \u2026 so she can\u2019t find them \u2026 You can add to that notice expectations about what she will pay and what conditions she is to leave the property in. Alternatively offer her a \u2018cash for keys\u2019 deal where you give her a small payout, and she gives you the keys and walks. Lawyer up for this, will be the best $300 you\u2019ll ever spend. \n\n  \nAnd take out a restraining order against Kevin so he isn\u2019t allowed in the house. Or get it a condition of his bail that he\u2019s not allowed/whatever it takes to make it that he\u2019s not legally allowed at your property again. Because if he is he\u2019s going to damage something, or take a lot more.   \nAnd sue the pants off him, for both lots of missing stuff. He\u2019s going to have a hard time proving he didn\u2019t do the first round when you have him lockpicking the second time\u2026 same modus operandi and all that shizznit.", "NTA, be sure to tell kevin youll drop the charges if the figures he stole before show up, and once they do, continue the lawsuit", "Yep, and anyone who has a locked figurine ROOM isn\u2019t collecting the freebies with Happy Meals. They will be serious $$$$.", "This is part of the reason leases are important. If she moved out already and didn't pay for the month their may not be much she could do at this point. If she hadn't left then she would have had more of a leg to stand on.", "Oh.. and another legal thought:   \nIf she was in any way aiding and abetting his illegal activities (did she give him the keys to the house? Did she give him alarm codes? How did he get in through the front door?)\u2026 then your \u2018lease arrangement\u2019 with her might be voided under her acting illegally\u2026. Check this with a lawyer too.", "Yeah, my assumption is that rent has been paid. If it hasn't, that's another story."]}
