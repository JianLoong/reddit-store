I came to Canada many years before Alice and have been living in a house my parents paid for. That's why when Alice arrived four months ago, I invited her to stay with me. She paid rent but we never had a contract.\n\nIt started when she got a new boyfriend. She is head over heels for him (Kevin). She constantly invited him to my house without permission. He came and stayed for at least 6 days a week, sometimes overnight. \n\nI did have problems with Kevin staying in my house, but when I brought it up with Alice, she brushed it off and said he helped her adapt to this new life. He is Alice's only emotional support besides me. However, I discovered Kevin lurking around my house, especially near my bedroom and figurine room many times when he was around. \n\nIt happened a month ago when I got home from school. I didn\u2019t notice anything since all the doors were locked (even the door to my figurine room). Until I discovered some of my figurines disappeared. Neither Alice nor Kevin was at home, so I assumed I got stolen since Alice never comes into my figurine room.\n\nI called Alice, she didn\u2019t pick up but replied and said Kevin brought her to Ottawa for a surprise trip. I tried to explain that my figurines were gone, she asked if the house was broken into and told me to go check around. Alice didn\u2019t come back until two days after that, but she kept sending me pictures of her going out with Kevin in fancy places. For those two days, I changed locks, set up hidden security cameras, alerted my parents and was panicking and in an extremely distressed mood. \n\nNothing happened for two weeks, but Kevin decided to steal again. I saw him, with two other guys I didn\u2019t know lockpicking my figurine room door and coming out with my figurines through two cameras. I flipped out and called the police, basically got him arrested since stupid Kevin decided to go hang around. I believe he called Alice since she was home right after I did, crying and begging me to let Kevin go so we could talk. I literally showed Alice the evidence, but she still begged and said IT WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING. \n\nIt has been one week since Kevin was arrested, Alice kept going after me and demanded I let him go, and at one point I just lost it. We were fighting right in the middle of the night and I kicked her out of my house. \n\nSince then I have been receiving a lot of phone calls from her family, from Kevin\u2019s family and friends threatening me to have Alice back and drop the lawsuit I pressed on Kevin. They are calling me AH for abandoning Alice for some figurines. They say that I am not allowed to kick her out since she paid rent or they will sue. Right now when I am thinking back, Alice has no one besides me and Kevin, and she is literally sleeping on my patio every night without eating and showering. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683331969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13966c1/aita_for_kicking_my_best_friend_out_of_my_house/", "score": 3970, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll have any legal recourse as she didn\u2019t have a lease and taking you to court doesn\u2019t seem like an option for her.

She might be trying to save her own ass from prosecution.", "For sure. I'm just saying the laws do change depending on the scenario. But regardless just because she is paying it doesn't legally make it here. You don't own the house you are renting. And she is renting from op.", "Quite possible.", ">No. If the tenant is sharing the LLs space the rules are different and she absolutely can kick her out, add in illegal activity and the tennant has no legal claim to residencey.\n\nYep! Ontario has really solid tenant protection laws, but in this case, the person isn't a tenant, she's a lodger, and OP can kick her out immediately with no notice.", "30 days notice, or one month, whichever is greater in all Northeast states.", "NTA, isn't your friend like an accessory to the crime or at least has parasitic accessory liability? She took the benefits from the theif selling your stolen goods and opened your home to him.", "NTA. \n\nShe was getting spoiled because her boyfriend was stealing from you. That's it. If she knew and didn't tell you is one thing. \n\n>I literally showed Alice the evidence, but she still begged and said IT WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING. \n\nI don't think it was a misunderstanding. If they were conveniently first went missing when you were gone, then she probably helped.", "NTA. She knew he was stealing how else could he take her on the fancy trip your figurines paid for. Your under no obligation to have a thief in your home. I\u2019d be getting restraining orders very quickly and being clear with everyone that if they have a problem with it they can take the thieves in. Also keep pressing those charges. Actions have consequences", "NTA. She needs to find another place to stay.", "Nope. NTA Alice and her family are nothing more than trash. I am certain she not only knew her thief boyfriend stole from you, funding her trip, but she probably encouraged him to do it.  I highly doubt she was innocent. Stay safe and keep the trash out.", "You didn't kick her out over figurines. You kicked her out because even in the face of video footage showing her bf breaking and entering, she took his side. NTA, but do check the tenancy laws in Canada.", "NTA. Stand your ground on this. This isn\u2019t about only figurines. This about a person who invited a thief into your home and when confronted with the evidence says it ok. This is your home, the place where you are meant to be safe. Your roommate and boyfriend violated that. He broke into your house and stole from you. That\u2019s on him. You were even kind enough to let her stay until she kept pushing you. Block all of them, save the threatening texts just in case some other BS happens. Change the locks again if your roommate had a current copy and keep the cameras rolling.", "NTA, these aren't just \"figurines\", these things cost MONEY. MONEY he stole to use on a trip because hes a bum and your friend is too loves strucked to understand that I guess.", "NTA- How do you think he paid for the vacation?!?! Absolutely not! He should be trespassed from your property and record any interactions of them trying to get you to drop the case. It can be considered harassment and more. Alice is no longer your friend!", "NTA!!! Please don\u2019t drop the suit!!!! He made his bed, now he should lie in it. If you can\u2019t handle the consequences don\u2019t do the thing. And personally, Alice would have been kicked 7 different ways to Wednesday night if she chose her lying thieving boyfriend over a friend of 10 years\u2026", "NTA and change your locks NOW!", "NTA.\n\nThe real thing to remember: a crime was committed. You feel unsafe with that crowd.. including her. You are getting threats.\n\nYour friend has said (esentially) she is standing by him.. and , for all you know, she may even have known what was happening. She likely enjoyed a trip paid for by the theft..\n\nYou have a right to evict someone if their presence makes you unsafe..\nYou have the foundation for a restraining order... that ends the discussion about having to allow her back", "NTA\n\nNo misunderstanding.\n\nThose figurines paid for her trip to Ottawa.\n\nShe aided and abetted them.  I wouldn't doubt she gave him a key.", "You're a great friend. I'm sorry she's not. Press charges. Do not ever let her in your house again. Bag her shit up and put it outside. \nGet a restraining order. \nNTA.", "You couldnt be further from TA.\n\nTheres no \u201cmisunderstanding\u201d when someone\u2019s breaking in with lockpicks, and her taking his side is fucked", "NTA, but why sue Kevin? You have video evidence; why not press charges?", "NTA. Let Kevin's family and friends take care of her. \n\nAnd watch your back", "Betcha we know how  Kevin got her to Ottawa.", "NTA.  She is not your friend, she is an accomplice to a burglar who abused her relationship with you to rob you.  Press charges against both of them, and tell her family to fuck right off.", "NTA if she can afford rent, she can afford a hotel room. Don\u2019t let her guilt trip herself back in. She picked a guy over you already and disrespected your friendship.", "INFO I need to know what kind of figurines my curious mind won't let me sleep otherwise", "In Ontario if you share a bathroom and/or kitchen then you get a lot less protection as a renter. Like you are barely covered by the tenant act.", "NTA. How in the world did she try to justify the misunderstanding? Your friend and her boyfriend are the ah\u2019s.", "NTA Both Alice and Kevin and their families need to understand that there a consequences to stealing", "NTA.\n\nTime to chuck all of her belongings and change the locks again, OP.", "NTA\n\nI\u2019m to get downvoted but that\u2019s ok. \n\nYou and Alice have been friends for 10 years. She has bad taste in men and fell for a thief and, by giving him her key so he could duplicate it, was complicit in his theft of your belongings.\n\nYou are angry and rightfully so, and she is scared and homeless and currently living on your patio without food. She owes you a heartfelt apology with no excuses. I would call the police and ask that they send someone over to allow you to talk to Alice in their presence. \n\nTell Alice that your friendship is over but you can\u2019t let her freeze/starve on your property. You have video evidence of Kevin\u2019s crime and she is partly responsible for that. She chose Kevin over your friendship and that\u2019s her right but you will not drop the charges or the lawsuit for restitution. You will not allow her to say this was a misunderstanding regardless of her situation. \n\nBecause of your long standing friendship you will make her a one time offer and ease your conscience a little. Offer her the choice of helping her get back home (unless she has to stay for court) to her family by giving part of her rent money back or she can go to a women\u2019s/homeless shelter or she can find someplace else to live. \n\nEven if she is remorseful and apologetic it would be difficult to ever trust her again. This is a bed she made and has to lay in. Also make sure that the police know about the phone calls and threats and ask what can be done for your protection. \n\nI\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this position, it\u2019s hard to lose a longtime best friend.", "NTA why do you need to post this? Stealing is illegal. There isnt a misunderstanding. Definitely NTA", "NTA he stole from you and she condole it. How desperate is she. You don't need her around if that's the person she wants to be .Report all threats to the police. Kevin can rot.", "NTA he basically stole and she pretend it didnt happen. She shoulda dumpped him but nope. Kick her out and sue her for being a accolmice of a crime", "Nta. Figurines can be costly! I find it amazing that your friend and roommate would choose a thieving boyfriend over you and a roof over her head. I'm getting the feeling that maybe she knew about it. \nPlus, the fact that you spent a couple of days freaking out that your home got broken into and she couldn't give a duck! \nIf you invited her back in the house, I'd set some clear and hard boundaries. \nKeep the lawsuit. He stole, and there was emotional pain and suffering. \nKeep your head up and go with your gut.", "Not reimburse but get replacements of the same quality/state. NTA", "Alice is especially stupid because there's a serious housing crisis in Ontario. She's sleeping on the porch because she literally has no where else to do and it's not likely she'll be able to find a place she can afford. Certainly, she'll never find a place that gives her a deal like OP.", "And OP isn't kicking her out over figurines, OP is kicking her out over her harboring and excusing a thief. Ask those family members if they want a thief living in their house and I'll bet they'd pass. Stand strong OP!", "I did a quick google read, at worst there would be a judge to decide if in this specific case no warning is enough time for notice. \n\nMiddle of the night during a fight a week after the event. Maybe a little worrisome.", "NTA, you didn\u2019t abandon her over some figurines, you kicked her out for enabling her boyfriend to steal from you. Having said that, please check with an attorney (or a legal advice subreddit until you can find an attorney) to make sure you aren\u2019t running afoul of your local tenant laws. Many localities award tenant status to people even if they don\u2019t have a contract.", "NTA! Don't let her back. She has no respect for you. Don't drop the charges. I guess that was how he able to afford to take her out of town. I would change the front locks too. And leave the cameras up.", "Man, no good deed goes unpunished. Definitely NTA. Alice's parents need to step up and do something for their gullible and entitled daughter who is siding with her new thieving boyfriend over her long-term friend who was kind enough to let her stay.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking.", "I cannot imagine thinking, \"Yes I'll make threats, and this will ensure that the person I am threatening will invite someone back into their home, which would give me more access to carry out my threats.\""]}
