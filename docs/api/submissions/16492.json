I came to Canada many years before Alice and have been living in a house my parents paid for. That's why when Alice arrived four months ago, I invited her to stay with me. She paid rent but we never had a contract.\n\nIt started when she got a new boyfriend. She is head over heels for him (Kevin). She constantly invited him to my house without permission. He came and stayed for at least 6 days a week, sometimes overnight. \n\nI did have problems with Kevin staying in my house, but when I brought it up with Alice, she brushed it off and said he helped her adapt to this new life. He is Alice's only emotional support besides me. However, I discovered Kevin lurking around my house, especially near my bedroom and figurine room many times when he was around. \n\nIt happened a month ago when I got home from school. I didn\u2019t notice anything since all the doors were locked (even the door to my figurine room). Until I discovered some of my figurines disappeared. Neither Alice nor Kevin was at home, so I assumed I got stolen since Alice never comes into my figurine room.\n\nI called Alice, she didn\u2019t pick up but replied and said Kevin brought her to Ottawa for a surprise trip. I tried to explain that my figurines were gone, she asked if the house was broken into and told me to go check around. Alice didn\u2019t come back until two days after that, but she kept sending me pictures of her going out with Kevin in fancy places. For those two days, I changed locks, set up hidden security cameras, alerted my parents and was panicking and in an extremely distressed mood. \n\nNothing happened for two weeks, but Kevin decided to steal again. I saw him, with two other guys I didn\u2019t know lockpicking my figurine room door and coming out with my figurines through two cameras. I flipped out and called the police, basically got him arrested since stupid Kevin decided to go hang around. I believe he called Alice since she was home right after I did, crying and begging me to let Kevin go so we could talk. I literally showed Alice the evidence, but she still begged and said IT WAS ALL A MISUNDERSTANDING. \n\nIt has been one week since Kevin was arrested, Alice kept going after me and demanded I let him go, and at one point I just lost it. We were fighting right in the middle of the night and I kicked her out of my house. \n\nSince then I have been receiving a lot of phone calls from her family, from Kevin\u2019s family and friends threatening me to have Alice back and drop the lawsuit I pressed on Kevin. They are calling me AH for abandoning Alice for some figurines. They say that I am not allowed to kick her out since she paid rent or they will sue. Right now when I am thinking back, Alice has no one besides me and Kevin, and she is literally sleeping on my patio every night without eating and showering. \n\nSo, AITA?", "created_utc": 1683331969, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13966c1/aita_for_kicking_my_best_friend_out_of_my_house/", "score": 1034, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Lawyer up for this, will be the best $300 you\u2019ll ever spend. \n\n  \nAnd take out a restraining order against Kevin so he isn\u2019t allowed in the house.

It\u2019s unlikely she\u2019ll have any legal recourse as she didn\u2019t have a lease and taking you to court doesn\u2019t seem like an option for her.

She is taking no responsibility for any of this, not does she seem to understand in the future, he will probably bring her down with him. This is more than just taking something he saw laying around.

She stole diamond and sapphire earrings from me.  I kicked her out and she did the same thing.
