If you need noise to listen to, maybe a podcast in the drive home? \n\nNot trying to invalidate your needs, but you also need to think of his. Maybe have a talk about limiting calling to like 5mins to start then slowly working back from it until you\u2019re both okay with the situation. Possibly even just a text saying you\u2019re leaving somewhere instead of a call if you feel like you need to inform him every time.", "NAH but that\u2019s a lot of calls just to chat!", "Your call pattern sounds exhausting. And like a chore not making up for any other time.\nJust let me put everything I do on hold, be it chores, another conversation with someone in front of me or what ever else cause you are bored. \n\nYou are NTA yet, but you will be if you ignore his wish to reduce your calls. \nAnd to be honest in his shoes, I'd simply ignore your calls half the time from now on when I know your just at your parents or the store.", "Dunno if this will be seen, but here goes. \n\nMild ESH.\n\nHe didn't communicate in the most graceful manner, but he's not wrong to express boundaries in this sense. You turning it around and saying he's overreacting is also a bad move, even if it's true. Accusing someone of wrongdoing is almost never conducive to constructive dialogue when they're already upset. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have had this very same discussion. We live together and she's very fond of calling me whenever she's driving. I find it very distracting from my normal tasks, (not to mention I actively dislike talking on the phone for extended periods). We've found a compromise in that she calls me less frequently, so when she does I'm able to endure it with more grace. \n\nWhile you're not wrong to want a much time with him as you can get, you'll undermine the relationship if you do not consider his side of the situation. I don't wish to speak for him, but I know many men value alone time, since that is the only time many of us are able to unwind. There's often too many responsibilities and expectations associated with partners for us to find their presence relaxing, and that extends to phone calls. \n\nI'd recommend alternate who you call between friends and family or find a podcast/audio book that you enjoy to help fill your driving time.", "NAH, honestly it\u2019s not bad that you call him a lot, but it\u2019s also not bad he gets annoyed by it. If I were him I wouldn\u2019t want to be called like that, there\u2019s not that much to talk about lol. \n\nSo no one sucks, I guess if he doesn\u2019t like it then just call him less, and don\u2019t be upset by it. I don\u2019t view it as a red flag or anything like that.", "NAH\n\nI call friends and family when I\u2019m driving around - maybe  mix it up if it\u2019s too frequent for his liking?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is annoying, even if you have a 2 year old.", "YTA - his reasoning is valid.", "I think NAH for calling. But, y b t a if you don't respect your partner's wishes. He could've communicated differently or earlier, but he is setting a boundary, and you should respect that imo. However, talking about it without the emotions and coming up with a solution for the both of you would be the most mature thing to do.", "NAH. He\u2019s not doing the most amazing job of communicating with you calmly in this case, but he does seem to be trying in general to support you. You\u2019re well within your rights to want to talk with your partner, but at this point he has let you know that the current system isn\u2019t working for him anymore, and it\u2019s on you to take the next step and let him know you\u2019re willing to talk out a compromise.\n\nI\u2019ve actually been in your partner\u2019s position in my relationship. It was hard for me to bring up, because I knew the calls were important to him, but it would often feel like I I was right in the middle of something and had to drop it within seconds to get the phone. We talked, and our compromise is that if he calls and I don\u2019t pick up, he will only call back if it\u2019s urgent, and he won\u2019t take it as a slight. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to talk to him, it\u2019s that I\u2019m busy at that moment. I\u2019ll often call back a few minutes later when I\u2019ve finished loading the dishwasher, or whatever it is I was doing. Either of us are also allowed to say that we need to duck off the call for any reason. His is normally calling his sister, mine is walking the dog. \n\nI do think, softly, that YWBTA if you don\u2019t have a conversation with him about how you can compromise, because right now it sounds like your partner is bearing more of the emotional labor in your arrangement. I don\u2019t have kids yet myself, but I would imagine that taking a call in the middle of toddler care is a bit harder than in the middle of loading a dishwasher. \n\n I will say y\u2019all are lucky to have each other, because you both seem to care about each other. Try to come at this from a place of appreciating that he was doing this for so long, despite it being a bit inconvenient for him, because he loves you. I\u2019m sure he appreciates that you want to talk with him because you love him too.", "From what I can tell you just like talking on the phone and he doesn\u2019t.

But if she did it when coming back from routine errands I\u2019d get a bit grumpy with her too.", "YTA. I have a lot of family members that do this and it drives me crazy. You don\u2019t want to be alone with your thoughts, do you?", "OMG. Yes.\n\nMy ex-husband used to call me all the time and would get upset and keep dialling if I didn't answer.  Didn't matter if I was at work, in the shower, changing a nap I had to drop everything to talk to him. It was fucking exhausting.  I used to \"forget\" my phone when I would go to the shops, just to get some peace.\n\nEdited: YTA, get used to your own company, sing along to the radio, listen to a podcast.", "YTA. My best friend was in a relationship with a man for 13 years who was like that, he'd call her when he was in his car, at all times (he was a musician) and just talk away about stuff. He kept doing it even when he was cheating on her because the calls were for him to have a nice time, they were never about her or bonding time. So be honest: it's not about having bonding time, it's you not being bored. Get audio books and let your partner do stuff without you around.", "NAH. I should be surprised but I\u2019m not at the Y T A, it seems all those people losing their minds have forgotten that telephones don\u2019t have to be answered.  They will be SHOOK I tell you, SHOOK, when they read this. So husband getting cranky is fair, but also he could just not answer rather than answering every time and then being a martyr about it. Equally calling every time is a lot, it\u2019s a bad habit, but he went along with it. Until he didn\u2019t.", "Nah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to call whenever you\u2019re free but I understand that may be too much for him. Neither is wrong. Just strike a new balance.", "This! As a courtesy hubs and I will shoot a quick text while running errands to say we\u2019re on our way home if it\u2019s solo stuff, but that\u2019s it. After work calls are one thing (we talk what we\u2019re prepping for dinner and shoot the shit about stupid things that happened at our jobs) but you\u2019re going to an extreme", "Same. I tolerate it because he LOVES to talk and it's part of how he shows affection.  I know he absolutely means well, but it's like \"dude, I will literally see you in ten minutes.  You don't need to call me just to say you're on your way back from the store and maybe (not always) you're excited to tell me what you got.  I've been to the store.  I could have guessed you would be coming home soon, and you can show me the great deals you found when you get here, and I will be excited to see them!  It's okay to wait five minutes and do all that in person.\n\nAnd yes, it interrupts whatever you're doing. Trying to get dinner started? Put down that pan, the phone's ringing. Doing dishes? Rinse off those suds and dry your hands, the phone's ringing. Just started to take a poo? Push fast and wipe quick - the phone's ringing. Exhausted from a long day and trying to catch a 15-minute cat nap? Wake up! The rackin' frackin' phone's ringing! \n\nAnd that's without having a toddler in the mix.  It's not like toddlers are notorious for getting into huge amounts of mischief if left unattended for two minutes or anything, right?  He's not going to come back from answering the phone to a bag of flour dumped on the carpet or a sledgehammer through the basement window, right?\n\nAlso, there's always at least a little bit of anxiety with calls from your SO when you know you'll be seeing them soon.  You can't just ignore the call - what if they got in an accident or had some other emergency and really need to reach you?  It's not like that random call you get every day around dinnertime, where you know it's probably just another recorded scam, so you can ignore it while you calmly finish whatever you're doing and then go check to see who called.\n\nGentle YTA, because I can tell this is coming from a place of affection on your part, but it has to be driving him nuts.  He can love you and still hate the phone.", "my partner does the same thing! i love her and i love when she calls. i\u2019m sure it\u2019s well intentioned for you as it is for her, but the simple fact is that these calls can kind of be a drag. it\u2019s a 20-30 minute interruption and it doesn\u2019t really have any bearing on quality time, if anything it looks like your partner is starting to dread it. so a soft gentle YTA.", "Soft YTA. Sounds like my wife. She used to do this until I had to ask to her to stop. \n\nI don\u2019t mean this to be rude, but it\u2019s not your husbands job to entertain you.", "YTA. Texting or a phone call for SAFETY purposes is one thing. Nightly call to be your entertainment is another thing.", "YTA. You sound overbearing and exhausting.", "YTA!!!!!", "YTA for expecting him to be at your beck and call", "YTA , wether you know it or not it\u2019s rude. You\u2019re not giving that person your full focus, cause you\u2019re driving, and you should be completely focused on your driving, but its unfair to expect full focus from them when you can\u2019t reciprocate. \n\nAlso your call isn\u2019t about that person , you\u2019re looking for something to do to kill time, and it doesn\u2019t even matter who you\u2019re speaking to, and that is also not fair to the person you\u2019re calling.\n\nI\u2019d recommend music or podcast to kill time and help keep you up.", "YTA. He does care about your safety and being on the phone for a drive home from work both keeps you safe and allows you to connect with each other. I am completely on your side and your husband is too: \n\nWhat isn\u2019t reasonable is being on the phone with him every time you drive. Errands can be done solo. There are podcasts, news broadcasts, playlists, other loved ones to call, meditation, letting your mind wander, playing I spy or something in the car. if you listen to a podcast on your way home, you then have an interesting topic of conversation to share with him when you are home. Conversation is good, but time apart and learning makes you a better conversationalist", "YTA. Your partner is not a podcast that you can use to pass the time when you are bored. He may have been okay with it in the past, but he\u2019s telling you that it\u2019s too much, so stop!", "distracted driving is actually really unsafe, and it sounds like you're doing it constantly. total AH move.", "He told you something bothered him and you said he was overreacting. Is that how you want him to discuss things that upset you? \n\nDo better. YTA", "YTA. My boyfriend likes calling when he's going from place to place too. But I can't multitask, because I have to focus due to background noise on his end. It completely disrupts whatever I'm doing at the time. It's hard to get stuff done if you're constantly on call with someone", "YTA. You sound like you are driving him crazy. Leave him alone! If you must chat with someone while driving call different people each day. Or listen to the radio, audiobooks, or your music.", "NAH. I think it's cute you want to chat with him all the time but I can understand he might think it's too much", "OK you were N T A for calling him before he asked you to stop because he said he was OK with it.\n\nHowever, he has now asked to you stop so you YWBTA for continuing and you are a bit YTA for even coming on here to ask because it seems like you are looking for someone to back you up.  You don't need our opinions; you need to listen to your partner who has made his wishes clear.", "NAH. I have a friend who calls me all the time when she\u2019s driving because she deals with intrusive thoughts. It was getting to become overwhelming and exhausting taking her calls not knowing if she was in crisis or just bored. However, instead of talking about it right away I bottled it up and let it get between us. I had to talk to friends (not mutual friends) about how to handle it, and I finally, without unleashing my resentment, worked on boundaries like talking once or twice a week instead of daily. \nI think your partner should have been kinder about those boundaries, and this revelation about needing boundaries could have hurt a lot less. This could be a learning moment for both of you. You\u2019ll learn to enjoy new music, podcasts, and ebooks. Your partner hopefully can learn to say things sooner. \n\n(I edited out the word \u201cunleashed\u201d since I\u2019m not sure by the post if your partner \u201cunleashed\u201d on you or just had a regular conversation asking for change)", "YTA. I have a good friend that does this and drives me nuts because it interrupts whatever else I would want to do.", "You sound annoying af. YTA", "NAH. It sounds like you want to connect with him, but he doesn\u2019t see it the same way. Instead, why not carve out time for an at home date night. Having kids is hard because it does take away time for just the two of you, but this isn\u2019t a good answer.", "YTA.  This borders on needy and codependant.  If he's dealing with the toddler while you're out especially, I don't blame him.  Learn to listen to audio books or podcasts.  Sing.  Crank up some music.  Have a late day coffee.  He's not your entertainment committee.  There is other stuff he wants/needs to be doing.  As someone who has been married a lot of years, when my kids were small and I was home alone with them (or out) if my spouse called me and I didn't feel like talking, we just wouldn't.  And he was fine with it.\n\nDo you have anxiety?  I'd check in with your own mental health.  This sounds really immature.", "YTA Time to get a podcast and a list of friends who are willing to chat with you every once in a while as you drive.", "If this was a two way thing, I would say NTA. But he has put his foot down, listen to him, if you don\u2019t, then you are indeed TA. \nMe and my husband call each other all the time when one of us is in the car. But\nThats us, we love it. But if my husband told me it needed to stop, then I absolutely would!", "YTA - I get it trust me I do, I'm kind of the same way. I like to talk to people on my way home from work, it's really the only time I can focus on a phone conversation with people. I will call my future mother-in-law, I will call one of my best friends that lives in Kentucky I'll call a really good friend of mine in Texas, I will even call my daughter-in-law in Oregon. But he is not being unreasonable asking you to stop calling. Maybe you should get an audiobook and listen to that on the way home instead.", "YTA he is not in the car with you he might be doing other things and not want to be tied into a conversation every spare minute you have throughout the day. If it's a late night trip, where you might fall asleep that's one thing, but to consistently call every time you're in the car is annoying and comes off very needy.", "YTA. Being on the phone while driving is dangerous. It stops your husband from doing his own thing. You sound like you suffer from toxic co-dependency, and you need to break this habit. Anything you need to talk about can wait until later.", "Jesus, you sound exhausting.  YTA", "YTA. I had an ex do this. We broke up over it because she refused to stop doing it and if I didn\u2019t pick up she would call repeatedly till I did. \n\nIt\u2019s not about conversing. It\u2019s entertainment. Like listening to the radio or a book on tape. You\u2019re using your partner as nothing more than an object to pass the time. Get over yourself and stop being so selfish.", "YTA.  Give the poor guy a break", "NAH. I'm surprised by all the Y T As. Yes, it seems like you call a lot, but loving your partner and wanting to chat with them frequently doesn't make you an AH. He's not an AH for not wanting to talk on the phone that much. You're driving so it's your free time. He's not. You're likely interrupting what he's doing. It's also okay if he just doesn't enjoy phone calls. It is not a reflection of his care for you.", "I think she's an AH for that too. If she needs to talk to someone in order to stay awake while driving, then she shouldn't be driving.", "How about not using your phone while driving too? Turn on the radio or something.", "This! They\u2019re called podcasts. Enjoy!", "True, but tiredness is more dangerous. It\u2019s fine when it\u2019s late and she\u2019s coming back from work", "Yeah, I call or text as I'm on my way home from anywhere, to make sure I get anything we need, because once I get home pj's are on and I'm not leaving the house again. Calling and keeping him on the phone the duration of the trip every time just to chat, not as a keep me awake thing? Nah.. early on that happened and as my husband pointed out, let's not exhaust all conversation on the phone on the way home, so we can be more engaged with each other in person", "I mean I absolutely avoid my own thoughts but that\u2019s what podcasts/radio/music are for. Having to drop everything for calls all the time must be infuriating, you may be bored but he\u2019s not", "But what if her partner is asleep, or doing something that he has to concentrate on, or is just unavailable to talk? OP needs to find some other way to stay awake while driving that isn't reliant on her partner being available to talk over the phone.", "Exactly this. It\u2019s just a curtesy text to give a heads up. Sometimes it\u2019s a cue to start dinner, but it is never an expectation of calling. \n\nNow there was an incident when the little one snagged his phone and face timed me. We were cracking up the whole time and the little one was giving me a talking to.", "If she actually wants to have a conversation with him, she should make time to do this when it's convenient for both of them. I get wanting to prioritize your relationship and have it not just be about being parents, but it sounds like these conversations always occur when she's driving home from someplace (i.e. she's looking for someone to entertain her). That says to me it's not about the conversation but about wanting to be distracted from something she finds tedious."]}
