Man is not overreacting; it should (edit: NOT) even be considered that he is overreacting as a possibility, let alone tell him that he is when he clearly said he feels like he is constantly waiting for the phone to ring. Meaning, you are stressing him out for nothing and gaslighting him in the process. YTA.", "YTA. When someone says they don't wanna do something anymore because they're annoyed and you say something along the line of \"What're you talking about? You're overreacting.\" Is straight up an AH move. The least you can do right now is to respect his space", "YTA for calling so often just so he can entertain you. Let the poor guy have some time to himself.

Learn some independence.", "YTA because he told you how he feels and you dismissed them saying he\u2019s overreacting. He shouldn\u2019t have to be on the phone with you every second of the day. He deserves time to himself. Are you really that needy that you need to be either with him or talking to him every second? If you have trouble driving at night blast some music or listen to a podcast.

His delivery doesn\u2019t sound great, but time apart is actually really important for healthy relationships and it seems like he\u2019s not getting enough of that.

He seems to be a loving carrying person as he's dropping whatever he's doing and answering instead of sending you to voice mail. \n\nAs someone on the receiving end of these types of calls i feel for your hubby. Sometimes it's nice to have time to yourself when you live under the same roof and having this peace interrupted everyday by someone who is bored while driving and who will see you in person soon enough can be extremely frustrating.", "YTA.

He's just now getting annoyed? He's more patient than most.", "His reaction is a bit much but he's not making an unreasonable request. If you are truly calling him on the way home from as many places as you mentioned, then you're calling him a few times every day. As meaningful as it be, there is still such a thing as too much. I personally like hearing from my wife, but not so much that I would expect her to call me multiple times a day.\n\nTry talking it over with him to see if you can find out why he feels this way all of a sudden.", "Soft AH.

I lasted a couple of days after that.  And she was surprised for some reason", "Mild YTA because I think you believe your intentions are good. Perhaps your husband didn\u2019t express himself in the right way, but I\u2019m assuming the frustration he\u2019s expressing is coming from the fact you\u2019re calling all throughout the day, likely demanding he be an active participant in each conversation, and the communication is so frequent there\u2019s not much to talk about.\n\nAnd I know you feel it\u2019s making up for the time you don\u2019t get alone because of your toddler, but calling someone to kill time or keep you awake while driving is more for you than for the both of you.", "YTA. \n\nI have someone in my life who does that.

Everyone already said what needed to be said and also: when someone says they don\u2019t want you calling, your reaction should be to listen to their boundary, not tell them that they are overreacting.

Don\u2019t force it.", "Are you on the phone while driving ? If yes, YTA just for that.", "YTA. Stop being so needy. It\u2019s one thing to call late at night, but calling every time you\u2019re out is excessive and tiresome. I would just stop answering the phone if my spouse did that do me.", "YTA\n\n\nSounds like you need a good podcast or audio book.\n\n\nYour husband isn't an entertainment system, he's a fellow human being with a whole life of his own, even when you're not with him.

You call when you're driving but he has to stop what he's doing to talk to you. So every time your driving he gets nothing done. That's massively annoying.", "ESH\n\nHe could have told you this without getting angry. \n\nYou need to listen to his request, because you don't have an entitlement to have him literally on-call every time you drive somehwere.", "I dont think anyone is the AH here \n\nI get wanting to call with him and your child while driving to chat, it is comforting to me personally as well to be on the phone with someone. \n\nHowever, you have to respect his time and wishes too. If he feels like you are calling too much with him while driving home, you could possibly call someone else? If you need noise to listen to, maybe a podcast in the drive home? \n\nNot trying to invalidate your needs, but you also need to think of his. Maybe have a talk about limiting calling to like 5mins to start then slowly working back from it until you\u2019re both okay with the situation. Possibly even just a text saying you\u2019re leaving somewhere instead of a call if you feel like you need to inform him every time.", "NAH but that\u2019s a lot of calls just to chat!", "Your call pattern sounds exhausting. And like a chore not making up for any other time.\nJust let me put everything I do on hold, be it chores, another conversation with someone in front of me or what ever else cause you are bored. \n\nYou are NTA yet, but you will be if you ignore his wish to reduce your calls. \nAnd to be honest in his shoes, I'd simply ignore your calls half the time from now on when I know your just at your parents or the store.", "Dunno if this will be seen, but here goes. \n\nMild ESH.\n\nHe didn't communicate in the most graceful manner, but he's not wrong to express boundaries in this sense. You turning it around and saying he's overreacting is also a bad move, even if it's true. Accusing someone of wrongdoing is almost never conducive to constructive dialogue when they're already upset. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have had this very same discussion. We live together and she's very fond of calling me whenever she's driving. I find it very distracting from my normal tasks, (not to mention I actively dislike talking on the phone for extended periods). We've found a compromise in that she calls me less frequently, so when she does I'm able to endure it with more grace. \n\nWhile you're not wrong to want a much time with him as you can get, you'll undermine the relationship if you do not consider his side of the situation. I don't wish to speak for him, but I know many men value alone time, since that is the only time many of us are able to unwind. There's often too many responsibilities and expectations associated with partners for us to find their presence relaxing, and that extends to phone calls. \n\nI'd recommend alternate who you call between friends and family or find a podcast/audio book that you enjoy to help fill your driving time.", "NAH, honestly it\u2019s not bad that you call him a lot, but it\u2019s also not bad he gets annoyed by it. If I were him I wouldn\u2019t want to be called like that, there\u2019s not that much to talk about lol. \n\nSo no one sucks, I guess if he doesn\u2019t like it then just call him less, and don\u2019t be upset by it. I don\u2019t view it as a red flag or anything like that.", "NAH\n\nI call friends and family when I\u2019m driving around - maybe  mix it up if it\u2019s too frequent for his liking?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He doesn't want to entertain you while you are doing your thing. He also deserves time alone.", "ESH I agree with what everyone is saying and you are calling way too much. However, his response of only in emergency is a little harsh. Why not limit to once a week? There\u2019s this thing called COMPROMISE!\n\nAlso, why are there so many instances where he is at home and you are running around? It\u2019s perfectly possible to clean the dishes or sweep the floor on the phone. Or is he sitting around relaxing all day while you do all the errands?", "YTA this is completely disrespectful of his time. He has reasonably asked to only call when it's late or an emergency but you are insisting on pestering him multiple times a day to 'chat'. That is annoying, even if you have a 2 year old.", "YTA - his reasoning is valid.", "I think NAH for calling. But, y b t a if you don't respect your partner's wishes. He could've communicated differently or earlier, but he is setting a boundary, and you should respect that imo. However, talking about it without the emotions and coming up with a solution for the both of you would be the most mature thing to do.", "NAH. He\u2019s not doing the most amazing job of communicating with you calmly in this case, but he does seem to be trying in general to support you. You\u2019re well within your rights to want to talk with your partner, but at this point he has let you know that the current system isn\u2019t working for him anymore, and it\u2019s on you to take the next step and let him know you\u2019re willing to talk out a compromise.\n\nI\u2019ve actually been in your partner\u2019s position in my relationship. It was hard for me to bring up, because I knew the calls were important to him, but it would often feel like I I was right in the middle of something and had to drop it within seconds to get the phone. We talked, and our compromise is that if he calls and I don\u2019t pick up, he will only call back if it\u2019s urgent, and he won\u2019t take it as a slight. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to talk to him, it\u2019s that I\u2019m busy at that moment. I\u2019ll often call back a few minutes later when I\u2019ve finished loading the dishwasher, or whatever it is I was doing. Either of us are also allowed to say that we need to duck off the call for any reason. His is normally calling his sister, mine is walking the dog. \n\nI do think, softly, that YWBTA if you don\u2019t have a conversation with him about how you can compromise, because right now it sounds like your partner is bearing more of the emotional labor in your arrangement. I don\u2019t have kids yet myself, but I would imagine that taking a call in the middle of toddler care is a bit harder than in the middle of loading a dishwasher. \n\n I will say y\u2019all are lucky to have each other, because you both seem to care about each other. Try to come at this from a place of appreciating that he was doing this for so long, despite it being a bit inconvenient for him, because he loves you. I\u2019m sure he appreciates that you want to talk with him because you love him too.", "From what I can tell you just like talking on the phone and he doesn\u2019t. He just didn\u2019t know what to say and it boiled over in the moment. It\u2019s really not unreasonable from either of you because there\u2019s equal \u201cblame.\u201d Your calling is a little excessive but there\u2019s a lot of people who just want to talk a lot. He easily could\u2019ve just been tired from the baby and reacted a little harshly.
