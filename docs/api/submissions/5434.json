If you need noise to listen to, maybe a podcast in the drive home? \n\nNot trying to invalidate your needs, but you also need to think of his. Maybe have a talk about limiting calling to like 5mins to start then slowly working back from it until you\u2019re both okay with the situation. Possibly even just a text saying you\u2019re leaving somewhere instead of a call if you feel like you need to inform him every time.", "NAH but that\u2019s a lot of calls just to chat!", "Your call pattern sounds exhausting. And like a chore not making up for any other time.\nJust let me put everything I do on hold, be it chores, another conversation with someone in front of me or what ever else cause you are bored. \n\nYou are NTA yet, but you will be if you ignore his wish to reduce your calls. \nAnd to be honest in his shoes, I'd simply ignore your calls half the time from now on when I know your just at your parents or the store.", "Dunno if this will be seen, but here goes. \n\nMild ESH.\n\nHe didn't communicate in the most graceful manner, but he's not wrong to express boundaries in this sense. You turning it around and saying he's overreacting is also a bad move, even if it's true. Accusing someone of wrongdoing is almost never conducive to constructive dialogue when they're already upset. \n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have had this very same discussion. We live together and she's very fond of calling me whenever she's driving. I find it very distracting from my normal tasks, (not to mention I actively dislike talking on the phone for extended periods). We've found a compromise in that she calls me less frequently, so when she does I'm able to endure it with more grace. \n\nWhile you're not wrong to want a much time with him as you can get, you'll undermine the relationship if you do not consider his side of the situation. I don't wish to speak for him, but I know many men value alone time, since that is the only time many of us are able to unwind. There's often too many responsibilities and expectations associated with partners for us to find their presence relaxing, and that extends to phone calls. \n\nI'd recommend alternate who you call between friends and family or find a podcast/audio book that you enjoy to help fill your driving time.", "NAH, honestly it\u2019s not bad that you call him a lot, but it\u2019s also not bad he gets annoyed by it. If I were him I wouldn\u2019t want to be called like that, there\u2019s not that much to talk about lol. \n\nSo no one sucks, I guess if he doesn\u2019t like it then just call him less, and don\u2019t be upset by it. I don\u2019t view it as a red flag or anything like that.", "NAH\n\nI call friends and family when I\u2019m driving around - maybe  mix it up if it\u2019s too frequent for his liking?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That is annoying, even if you have a 2 year old.", "YTA - his reasoning is valid.", "I think NAH for calling. But, y b t a if you don't respect your partner's wishes. He could've communicated differently or earlier, but he is setting a boundary, and you should respect that imo. However, talking about it without the emotions and coming up with a solution for the both of you would be the most mature thing to do.", "NAH. He\u2019s not doing the most amazing job of communicating with you calmly in this case, but he does seem to be trying in general to support you. You\u2019re well within your rights to want to talk with your partner, but at this point he has let you know that the current system isn\u2019t working for him anymore, and it\u2019s on you to take the next step and let him know you\u2019re willing to talk out a compromise.\n\nI\u2019ve actually been in your partner\u2019s position in my relationship. It was hard for me to bring up, because I knew the calls were important to him, but it would often feel like I I was right in the middle of something and had to drop it within seconds to get the phone. We talked, and our compromise is that if he calls and I don\u2019t pick up, he will only call back if it\u2019s urgent, and he won\u2019t take it as a slight. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t want to talk to him, it\u2019s that I\u2019m busy at that moment. I\u2019ll often call back a few minutes later when I\u2019ve finished loading the dishwasher, or whatever it is I was doing. Either of us are also allowed to say that we need to duck off the call for any reason. His is normally calling his sister, mine is walking the dog. \n\nI do think, softly, that YWBTA if you don\u2019t have a conversation with him about how you can compromise, because right now it sounds like your partner is bearing more of the emotional labor in your arrangement. I don\u2019t have kids yet myself, but I would imagine that taking a call in the middle of toddler care is a bit harder than in the middle of loading a dishwasher. \n\n I will say y\u2019all are lucky to have each other, because you both seem to care about each other. Try to come at this from a place of appreciating that he was doing this for so long, despite it being a bit inconvenient for him, because he loves you. I\u2019m sure he appreciates that you want to talk with him because you love him too.", "From what I can tell you just like talking on the phone and he doesn\u2019t.

But if she did it when coming back from routine errands I\u2019d get a bit grumpy with her too.", "YTA. I have a lot of family members that do this and it drives me crazy. You don\u2019t want to be alone with your thoughts, do you?", "OMG. Yes.\n\nMy ex-husband used to call me all the time and would get upset and keep dialling if I didn't answer.  Didn't matter if I was at work, in the shower, changing a nap I had to drop everything to talk to him. It was fucking exhausting.  I used to \"forget\" my phone when I would go to the shops, just to get some peace.\n\nEdited: YTA, get used to your own company, sing along to the radio, listen to a podcast.", "YTA. My best friend was in a relationship with a man for 13 years who was like that, he'd call her when he was in his car, at all times (he was a musician) and just talk away about stuff. He kept doing it even when he was cheating on her because the calls were for him to have a nice time, they were never about her or bonding time. So be honest: it's not about having bonding time, it's you not being bored. Get audio books and let your partner do stuff without you around.", "NAH. I should be surprised but I\u2019m not at the Y T A, it seems all those people losing their minds have forgotten that telephones don\u2019t have to be answered.  They will be SHOOK I tell you, SHOOK, when they read this. So husband getting cranky is fair, but also he could just not answer rather than answering every time and then being a martyr about it. Equally calling every time is a lot, it\u2019s a bad habit, but he went along with it. Until he didn\u2019t.", "Nah. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s bad to call whenever you\u2019re free but I understand that may be too much for him. Neither is wrong. Just strike a new balance.", "This! As a courtesy hubs and I will shoot a quick text while running errands to say we\u2019re on our way home if it\u2019s solo stuff, but that\u2019s it.

I tolerate it because he LOVES to talk and it's part of how he shows affection.  I know he absolutely means well, but it's like \"dude, I will literally see you in ten minutes.  You don't need to call me just to say you're on your way back from the store and maybe (not always) you're excited to tell me what you got.  I've been to the store.  I could have guessed you would be coming home soon, and you can show me the great deals you found when you get here, and I will be excited to see them!  It's okay to wait five minutes and do all that in person.\n\nAnd yes, it interrupts whatever you're doing. Trying to get dinner started? Put down that pan, the phone's ringing. Doing dishes? Rinse off those suds and dry your hands, the phone's ringing. Just started to take a poo? Push fast and wipe quick - the phone's ringing. Exhausted from a long day and trying to catch a 15-minute cat nap? Wake up! The rackin' frackin' phone's ringing! \n\nAnd that's without having a toddler in the mix.  It's not like toddlers are notorious for getting into huge amounts of mischief if left unattended for two minutes or anything, right?  He's not going to come back from answering the phone to a bag of flour dumped on the carpet or a sledgehammer through the basement window, right?\n\nAlso, there's always at least a little bit of anxiety with calls from your SO when you know you'll be seeing them soon.  You can't just ignore the call - what if they got in an accident or had some other emergency and really need to reach you?  It's not like that random call you get every day around dinnertime, where you know it's probably just another recorded scam, so you can ignore it while you calmly finish whatever you're doing and then go check to see who called.\n\nGentle YTA, because I can tell this is coming from a place of affection on your part, but it has to be driving him nuts.  He can love you and still hate the phone.", "my partner does the same thing! i love her and i love when she calls. i\u2019m sure it\u2019s well intentioned for you as it is for her, but the simple fact is that these calls can kind of be a drag. it\u2019s a 20-30 minute interruption and it doesn\u2019t really have any bearing on quality time, if anything it looks like your partner is starting to dread it. so a soft gentle YTA.", "Soft YTA. Sounds like my wife. She used to do this until I had to ask to her to stop. \n\nI don\u2019t mean this to be rude, but it\u2019s not your husbands job to entertain you.", "YTA.

There are podcasts, news broadcasts, playlists, other loved ones to call, meditation, letting your mind wander, playing I spy or something in the car. if you listen to a podcast on your way home, you then have an interesting topic of conversation to share with him when you are home.

You don't need our opinions; you need to listen to your partner who has made his wishes clear.", "NAH. I have a friend who calls me all the time when she\u2019s driving because she deals with intrusive thoughts. It was getting to become overwhelming and exhausting taking her calls not knowing if she was in crisis or just bored. However, instead of talking about it right away I bottled it up and let it get between us. I had to talk to friends (not mutual friends) about how to handle it, and I finally, without unleashing my resentment, worked on boundaries like talking once or twice a week instead of daily. \nI think your partner should have been kinder about those boundaries, and this revelation about needing boundaries could have hurt a lot less. This could be a learning moment for both of you. You\u2019ll learn to enjoy new music, podcasts, and ebooks. Your partner hopefully can learn to say things sooner. \n\n(I edited out the word \u201cunleashed\u201d since I\u2019m not sure by the post if your partner \u201cunleashed\u201d on you or just had a regular conversation asking for change)", "YTA.

If he's dealing with the toddler while you're out especially, I don't blame him.  Learn to listen to audio books or podcasts.  Sing.  Crank up some music.  Have a late day coffee.  He's not your entertainment committee.  There is other stuff he wants/needs to be doing.  As someone who has been married a lot of years, when my kids were small and I was home alone with them (or out) if my spouse called me and I didn't feel like talking, we just wouldn't.

I will call my future mother-in-law, I will call one of my best friends that lives in Kentucky I'll call a really good friend of mine in Texas, I will even call my daughter-in-law in Oregon.

Maybe you should get an audiobook and listen to that on the way home instead.", "YTA he is not in the car with you he might be doing other things and not want to be tied into a conversation every spare minute you have throughout the day. If it's a late night trip, where you might fall asleep that's one thing, but to consistently call every time you're in the car is annoying and comes off very needy.", "YTA.

Give the poor guy a break", "NAH. I'm surprised by all the Y T As. Yes, it seems like you call a lot, but loving your partner and wanting to chat with them frequently doesn't make you an AH. He's not an AH for not wanting to talk on the phone that much. You're driving so it's your free time. He's not. You're likely interrupting what he's doing.

The husband waited until he was really irritated before he expressed his needs. How is she supposed to read his mind?  (Don't men always criticize women for thinking that men should \"just know\" stuff?)  It's perfectly legit for her to want to chat all the time and it's perfectly legit for him to let her know that it's too much for him. They need to learn how to negotiate this difference. Sounds like he's a bit of a people pleaser if he can't relax if he thinks she's going to call. (Heck, I'd just tell my husband I need to chill and we'll talk when he gets back.) Adults use their words.", "NAH. You like having someone to talk to, he\u2019s too busy sometimes or needs a little space before you get home. Call someone else, no big deal.", "YTA. Forcing someone to have conversations with you while you\u2019re driving home is immature and clingy. It\u2019s almost like you\u2019re attempting to control him when you aren\u2019t with him. Like you wonder what he\u2019s up to and keep yourself calm and reassured by keeping him locked into a phone call with you. Put on some music like everyone else and focus on the road.", "YTA really u should never tell someone they are overreacting. You are clearly invalidating his feelings as not a big deal but he was honest enough to let you know how he feels so clearly it was a big deal to him.", "YTA. It\u2019s one thing to have phone calls be a part of your relationship, where both people call each other regularly. Nothing wrong with a couple staying in touch over phone calls the same way they would over text messaging\u2014if it\u2019s mutual.\n\nIt\u2019s another for it to be one-sided.

Technically my mom would do this to me and my brothers when we lived there as well (call after work, call when we get there, call when we get to our  friends house, etc.). \n\nOnce I moved out for college, I kind of flipped out on my mom like your husband did. I let her know I wouldn\u2019t be calling her through my day. I\u2019ll call when there\u2019s an emergency or I just want to talk but I wasn\u2019t doing that anymore. My parents still do this all the time.  They\u2019re just used to it. \n\nHe asked you to stop, I get that your feelings may be hurt but it\u2019s honestly probably draining him a bit.

Like what's the big deal. \n\nAlso if he is busy when you call, he can not take it, right?\n\nNTA.", "YTA  He is not overreacting. If he doesn\u2019t want to pick up, he has that option. He told you not to call so much. Call others on a rotation. You\u2019ll probably have a more enjoyable conversation than talking to someone who\u2019s annoyed at you for interrupting him.
