She's in college and moved out of our parents house in June. Since then my sister has gotten a bunch of tattoos. I'm cool with that but she knows our parents are not and she decided she was going to flaunt them all at my wedding for the first time, knowing our parents would react badly to them. She didn't stop there though. She went up to a few family members who are anti-tattoo and was gloating about getting them too. It ended up in a fight between her, our parents and a few extended family members. My sister was smirking the whole time. She was so glad she could get under our parents skin. She never told me a damn thing about it either. The whole fighting was so distracting and she approached me at one point during the reception and asked me why I wasn't standing up for her and actually talking to her. I was mad. I admit I was mad. She could have shown them the day before the wedding and let everyone get it out but she wanted to make sure more people saw and make a bigger scene over it.\n\nI ended up kicking several family members out of the wedding because they could not behave and I pretty much ignored my sister. She realized a few days ago and started texting me asking why I wasn't texting her and why I was \"being so weird\". I ignored her texts because I wasn't ready to talk but she decided to show up Sunday at my house and asked me why. She told me I was treating her like she did something wrong.\n\nI told her she did. That she knew our family would react badly and she used my wedding day to have that fight. I told her she had so much time to tell them and let things happen but she waited so she could take so much attention away from my husband and I on our wedding day. I said the fighting was distracting for so many people, the tension was palpable and she knew what she was doing. I told her she made me regret inviting any of them and I told her that included her.\n\nShe told me I should be mad at our family, not her, that they were always the ones who did the wrong thing. She brought up how once she was born I was brushed aside and how it wasn't her fault. But it showed why I should be only mad at our family. I told her she didn't get to draw so much attention to herself intentionally and expect me to be okay with it when it was supposed to be my wedding, you know, one of the happiest days for a couple.\n\nShe started yelling and she told me I was punishing and blaming her unfairly and she thought I understood our parents sucked, etc. She sent me a string of texts yesterday saying I had been so unfair to her.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1697565122, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17a48da/aita_for_telling_my_18_year_old_sister_she_does/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

My sister is young and our parents aren't the best so maybe I shouldn't be mad at her and should just let her off the hook. Maybe I'm even selfish for caring so much.

Thats... a lot.", "NTA - I think your sister is the only AH here. She has an entitlement problem and could not stand to not be the main character for a day and sabotaged your wedding with malice.

She's the AH for inciting drama on what should have been a nice occasion, not a Jerry Springer episode. \n\nYour family members who gave in to her attention seeking are also the AHs.

At best, she kept her tattoos a secret until a time when she knew the family would be less likely to blow up on her. At worst, she did this for exactly the scene that happened. Either way, your wedding was not the time or place for this conflict, and yes if she wanted to show off her tattoos to the family she should've had that conversation BEFORE your wedding.  \n\n\nBut the rest of your family should've also known better and saved that fight for another day.
