You dont owe them anything and you certainly didnt agree to do it. People like that are why nice things get ruined for everyone. They are always strangely oblivious to how toxic their behavior is too.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would have stopped doing it the moment they would take 1 thing and leave the rest at your place. At that point tell them to take all of their things and that the arrangement will not continue.", "NTA. Your neighbours sound awful and so ungrateful. I\u2019d take any parcels of theirs you have left in your home waiting for them to collect, and dump them outside their front door.", "NTA, they're obviously taking advantage of you, good on you for putting an end to it", "NTA they've took advantage of your generoisity.\n\nIf they're that concerned that parcels are being missed then they can set up a PO box and get deliveries sent to that.", "Nta you have awful neighbors", "When someone has a package sent to your house, it should be considered a gift. How lovely of them. Start keeping anything with your address on it and the problem will resolve itself quickly.

But if you really wanted to be TAH, you could charge them for each package you hold for them, $5 for small up to $50 for especially large ones.", "NTA.\n\nNo good deed goes unpunished", "NTA. Offering to take in an occasional package doesn't mean agreeing to being an unpaid concierge.", "NTA. \n\nYour new neighbors suck. Not only are you giving up space, you're also giving up precious sleep. They can go fuck themselves.", "NTA, from a fellow night shift worker it would drive me nuts having to wake up constantly for other peoples packages like this, especially when they aren't even showing any gratitude. \n\n\nNext lot of parcels if you know they are theirs, simply don't answer. If it's a combination of yours, a good neighbours, and theirs, simply decline taking theirs in. \n\n\nThey've taken advantage of a kind gesture, and when they started to abuse that, they should have lost any rights to it.", "NTA and if they are worried about their packages they can have them held at a UPS or Fed Ex location. I used to order wine, and I had it delivered to our local Walgreen's, because I wouldn't be home and it requires a signature. UPS and Fed Ex websites will show where those places are. And if they don't pick it up it might get sent back...lol.", "NTA. I'd be pissed too! I order a lot online, and live in an apartment. where i am is safe, no porch pirates, so if its sits outside, even overnight, its fine. My neighbors will sometimes bring my stuff in, but not always. which is fine. \n\nAnd my friend next door will bring things in for me if I'm gone, and I don't want to bother my neighbors. But I only ask her, its very rare, and i've never asked my neighbors to be my delivery personl.", "NTA not even a little bit, you were nice enough to help out your neighbors, and they decided to take advantage of that. This was your time to rest as someone who work nights, so having to get up multiple times, interrupting your sleep, is just horrible of them. They were rude, selfish and very entitled. \n\nThey really took the cake by putting your address on their packages. Please never do anything for these people again that is unbelievably ridiculous. The audacity, is hell no!!!", "Info,  did you tell them that you would no longer be willing to accept their packages before sending items back?  The neighbors are obviously asses, and you're not wrong to put a stop to them taking advantage of you.
