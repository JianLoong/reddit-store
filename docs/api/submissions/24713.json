You dont owe them anything and you certainly didnt agree to do it. People like that are why nice things get ruined for everyone.

This was your time to rest as someone who work nights, so having to get up multiple times, interrupting your sleep, is just horrible of them.

No back and forth, no threats or ultimatums.\n\nI do wonder at their gall, too, at starting to give your address as their mailing address.
