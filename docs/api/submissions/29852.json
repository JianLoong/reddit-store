They had asked about Thursday and Friday. He maybe should have asked, but you expect adults to speak up when others are accommodating them. They are the ones asking someone to give up something, so they need to be clear. Now if they really said 'the rest of the week' then OP should have clarified. He maybe should have asked Friday evening anyway, but that is just being extra", "Seriously, it's only like 50 bucks a day, and if that's too much then Uber/Lyft. I don't get why people are willing to stay at someone's house, and inconvenience them in every way possible, you're already taking space, food and time, you could at the very least have the transportation part figured out.", "She has to mind my gran so can't leave the house today", "Probably less than adding them to your insurance, plus no liability for OP.", "Your gran needs 24/7 supervision? You aunt & uncle should offer to mind her to give your mom a break.", "Yeah she does. There's normally a carer there just not today."]}
