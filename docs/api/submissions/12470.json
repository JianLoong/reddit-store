Take initiative in basic childcare. \n2. Instead of asking your wife, read up on necessary information yourself. Maybe SHE\u2019D appreciate being able to rely on you for information too! That goes for parenting methods, safety, milestones, etc. \n3. Know the important info yourself rather than expecting her to be responsible for all knowledge. What size clothing does your kid wear right now? When is their next pediatrician appointment?
