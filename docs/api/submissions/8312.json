For those of you that don't know, part of the celebrations include giving red packets with some money in it (a very toxic practice imo) for unmarried younger relatives, mostly kids.\n\nMy wife 25F (I am 28M) was preparing the red packets when I was reminded of how rude some of her relatives' kids were. I'm talking 18 year olds, 20 year olds. Not toddlers or even below 10 year old kids. They're so rude they don't even say hi sometimes when I arrive into let's say, her grandparents home, even though i am elder than them and in our culture you have to call them by their title when you meet them. So thinking about this, I became very angry and i told her not to give any red packets to them. She agreed with me that they are rude, but her opinion is that it is still our responsibility to uphold this part of our tradition even if they are rude, and we are not giving much anyway ($8 each to five kids)\n\nI saw red when she said that because we are currently going through some things that require money and we are deeping a lot into our savings, so i stood my ground. That started an argument and she was obsessing over the fact that this will be very embarassing for us and for her family if we don't give the red packets even though we have been married for 2 years already and we didn't give for the past years, and she said that we are giving red packets to the other relatives kids so it is unfair if we didnt give them. I felt that she was caring too much about what others think about us and her 'face' so I insisted and didnt give in. this went on until she threatened me to not turn up at all for any of the visiting that we had agreed to do before hand, and this is a big deal in our tradition (unless you had a valid reason like sickness or important events etc). I saw red and I yelled at her, and she got very upset by that and started throwing things back at me too. \n\nI left the room after that to wait for her to cool down and talk in a civilised manner, but she remained very upset even after that. We ended up giving the red packets anyway because I sought my father's advice and he said I was the AH and we should give since it is within our budget. He says I should apologize but I dont think this argument should even have been a thing in the first place if she had just listened to me. My wife and I are fine now but her throat and mine are still sore from the screaming and she has been hinting that it was my fault so aita?", "created_utc": 1674714797, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10lljwu/aita_for_not_wanting_to_give_money_to_my_wifes/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

There's a big difference. \n\nIt seems like you don't care if your wife loses face in front of her family, but you saw red at the idea of you losing face if you didn't do the traditional visits, and you want to pick and choose which traditions to uphold without caring about what's important to your wife.

Sure, we can all say that there would never have been an argument if the other party had just abandoned their beliefs on the matter and acquiesced to the other. But that doesn't account for each party being an individual person with agency. In this case, what made her the one who needed to listen to you instead of the other way around?\n\nSecondly, you're using \"traditions\" as an argument only when it's convenient. You want others to respect your traditions, while at the same time you're declining to follow the one that has a cost to you.

You become belligerent when not obeyed. Obeyed to your very bad ways that even you don't support as you listen to your dad when he gave you the same good advice your wife knew to do without being told.\n\nWhy would anyone listen to you? Because otherwise you would yell at them? And you call them trying to avoid the embarrassment you bring on them - 'threatening you'???\n\nNO. YTA on all levels. You need to start respecting your wise wife, stop disrespecting women, stop yelling and expecting 'obedience' from someone just because they are female or you 'see red'. It's obvious your wife is smarter than you and you're trying to bring her down through loosing of temper every time  she has an opinion, yelling, and calling disengaging from your bad choices 'threats'.\n\nThis is 2022 dude, you can't live like it's the 1000.

I say this as someone who is also ethnically Chinese and grew up with some of the new year's traditions. There was no need to yell. I view lai see as an integral part of the traditions, just as much as visiting. I also never grew up receiving my lai see without properly greeting and giving good wishes to the elder giving it to me. I think that is a fair expectation. That said, maybe it's not about the money for her. It's literally 40 dollars you're arguing over. Maybe it's about being part of her family member's holiday and traditions and she thinks this is a good way to connect with them.  \n\n\nIf the money really bothers you next year, do what my family does.

Moreover, if you\u2019re giving red packets to other kids but not them, you can imagine the criticism that will be ongoing behind you and your wife\u2019s backs. Imo $40 is a low price to prevent such drama from arising. Thirdly, is the family huge? If there\u2019s a lot of people arriving for the celebration, it\u2019s possible the kids may not notice your arrival/ is not familiar with you.

You shouldn't be so obsessed with the idea of your wife from your perspective prioritizing her image over your feelings.

Major AH and probably way more underlying problems. OP knows the traditions but doesn't actually understand it. I don't think this marriage lasts much longer for example seeing red over $8 gifts for 5 children, creating huge fight, and even dad calling OP the AH.", "Isnt that the whole point? Lol. \n\nIt really depends on the family. My parents used to use it as an opportunity to help out some of my cousins and none of us ever judge. Although, I do keep a record of how much I receive and from who and which year (written on the red packets themselves) which I keep because Im OCD and it is a good reference point for my mum so she knows how much to give the next year.", "Agree but he is still YTA.

All your reasons went out the door when your father told you to give money", "She was right though.

YTA\n\nAnd how you managed to skip giving last two years and intend to skip it again this year is embarrassing.

You keep blaming her for all of this, but you made the problem since you agreed with your father. \n\nIs it me or do you just want to boss your wife around cause you had no problem giving when your father said to.", "I'll answer your question directly. No. Not showing up is better than showing up and be an asshole about it. That's her relatives and you insisted on being an asshole to embarrass her, she was literally too embarrassed to show up, by you, the screaming man child who threw a fit over what? 50 bucks?

And the victim blaming. She pushed my buttons. Lol...", "So you\u2019re also a misogynistic asshole. Because you\u2019re the man of the house and your wife must do what you say.
