One lives in another country ('jenny') doesn't really have contact with her family. The one who lives close to me (hellen) is very closed off. She's nice when I see her but has always declined every invitation I've offered for her to come hang out with me/go out. The one from another state (karen) is very friendly with me. Calls and texts me often and we are very close.\n\nWe spoke a lot about hanging out when she comes, having sleep overs, breakfast dates, gym dates and such, I was very excited for her to come because I live far from my sisters. Karen was the one who initiated these conversations.\n\nShe came to our state to visit for the summer and stayed primarily at her sisters house, which is expected and I wasn't offended, especially because they live so close. They started going to the gym without me (not inviting me), and going out by themselves and with our mutual friend group without me. I was upset but didn't say anything to them or my husband.\n\nI asked when they were free to hang out a few times and I was brushed off so I stopped asking\n\nWe were all invited to a family members house and they mentioned going out with our MUTUAL friend group. When they realized they mentioned plans in front of me they asked if I wanted to come. I said sure, thinking the plans were last minute and I was hearing about it in real time, shaking off the weird feeling I had.\n\nWhen I got there I realized that these were plans made in advanced in a group chat that I am not in and I was not meant to be invited (there is a group chat I am in, it was just not used) . I was super embarrassed feeling like I intruded but again said nothing.\n\nWhen I got home my husband asked how his sisters were and after some prodding he tells me they had called him that morning upset about having invited me, feeling like they felt obligated to invite me, and how they shouldn't have to take me everywhere and they just wanted to hang out with their friends without me. He didn't like that and put them in their place.\n\n(just to clarify, the only time I've seen them is when we did group activities with their kids or their parents three times, and she slept at my house once. I didn't go to any of their other outings with them and at this point she has been here for three weeks)\n\nFeeling offended and embarrassed, I texted them apologizing for overstepping on their toes and reiterating to them that they aren't obligated to invite me or include me if they don't want to. they responded that of course they want to hang out with me and they don't feel obligated.... then they called my husband upset that he told me what they said\n\nI feel like maybe I shouldn't have said anything but I feel really offended and annoyed.I understand that there is an age gap, and that they're sisters and that I won't be invited to everything but AITA confronting them?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEDIT : for more context and clarification. The sister who lives close to me 'hellen' has made it clear she keeps me at arms length, shes not interested in another sister and she just keeps to herself and thats fine.  so I stopped reaching out. Which is fine. The sister who lives far karen has made efforts (since even before I was married) to be close with me. She calls and texts and includes me in everything. So her coming and then kinda ditching me was a surprise to me. But due to some incidents in the past that are now coming to memory, I wouldn't be surprised if this has more to do with *Hellen* not wanting me around, more so than Karen.

It's time you believe them since they have shown who who they are. \n\nIt's understandable that you are offended...they don't want to have the same kind of relationship you want to have. Accept that. \n\nConfronting them showed they lie to you and go behind your back to their brother.

You married their brother and made an effort so for that reason alone despite the age difference, should have been at the very least honest.   I'm sorry.\n\nyou were direct - you saw it for what it was (marginalizing) and you were direct about it.   nothing wrong at all with that and your text was something I'd have done. Not cruel or hurt, just direct - 'Sorry- didn't mean to step on your toes'", "Well NTA but now you know they don't rea\u00f6ly want to hang out with you,possibly your \"friendgroup\" too so you might want to look for other people to hang out with", " NTA\n\nBut be done with his sisters now. Be civil at family gatherings, nothing more! Don\u2019t feel pressure to pretend all is fine and dandy, stay away but don\u2019t be outright rude. \n\nThey\u2019re rude, and honestly sound more like teenagers than grown women.", "Self-respect ma\u2019am. Block them and never look back. They don\u2019t like you it\u2019s obvious. Mutual friend group? Why did no one from that group invite you? Your SIL\u2019s are talking **** about you behind your back in front of these mutual friends that\u2019s why no one invited you. Time to look for new friends", "NTA \u2026.wow.  So they invited you because they realized they were talking about an upcoming outing in front of you, and they actually call your husband to rant about you having the colossal nerve to accept the one invitation that gets thrown out, and acting like \u2018why do we always have to include her\u2019.\n\nForget them.", "NTA, but they are a lot older than you, maybe try to find a cool friend group to hang out with.  These people are not interested, Is your husband closer to their age or yours?  They may see him as a much younger brother that they never actually bonded with.  \n\nHe was trying to stand up for you, he's a good husband.  They just aren't interested. They handled it terribly, and they should be nicer people.", "How did you end up on the chatlist ? It is odd that you are kind of the only one who didn't got invited . Seriously that is so teenager behaviour from this sisters . \n\nObviously they don't care about you so the only thing you can do is ask them what kind of relationship they want with you because its obvious that they don't want to be your family", "NTA \n\nWow, you expect to have to deal with cliques and being excluded when you are in high school, not now with grown women. Especially family. \n\nWell, you know where you stand. For some reason, they don\u2019t seem to like you or at least don\u2019t want to hang out with you. Take it to heart and focus on your other friendships. Hang out with mutual friends without the sisters and keep your distance.\n\nI\u2019m sorry they are excluding you, especially seeing as there didn\u2019t seem to be a triggering event of any kind. Could be age gap, could be different personalities, who knows. Point is don\u2019t dwell on it. Hopefully it will come to hurt less with time", "NTA. You didn't confront them, you apologized, which you didn't have to do considering they are the ones acting like jerks.\n\nProbably best to decline any invite they extend now that you know how two faced they are.", "NTA. Please stop committing any brainpower or tears to those childish asshats.  \n  \nIf you wanna play the long game and enjoy cooking in any capacity, it\u2019s time to break out the Martha Stewart-esque superpowers and become known for 1 to 2 exclusive classy parties per year (my recommendation is New Year\u2019s brunch or pre-Lent Carnivale if you\u2019re religious in that way) and/or dinner parties. Alternatively, if that\u2019s not your style, I see you like books and fashion: why not a book-based fashion party? Halloween/October might be easiest. Edit: could start with a book club to ease into it if need be.  \nThe long game part being that whether you purposely exclude your SILs or graciously invite them is really up to you.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t overstep. This was a normal level of involvement. I\u2019m sorry they are excluding you, it sounds very hurtful.", "My guess is that it is the age gap. You being in your mid-20s is just in a wildly different stage of life than ladies in their late 30s/early 40s. You sound like a nice, fun, eager person. It's not you. You are just so much younger and probably more eager and active and enthusiastic than they are. \n\nWork on expanding your circle of friends who are more your age. And a very gentle word to the wise - keep things your husband says to you to yourself. Every interaction doesn't need to be analyzed and discussed. \n\nI am going with NAH.", "Nta, fuck them and your old \"friend group\". It's time to make some friends that actually care about you.", "NTA. Go hang with some other cool people.", "This a tough one, i feel bad for everyone involved.\n\nprobably because they are sisters and you are their SIL and due to the age gap i can understand them wanting to be on their own.\n\nbut no you are NTA in my opinion. \n\nThey should maybe have done something else fun with you though rather than all together.", "I have to admit, if I were still in my late 30s, I wouldn\u2019t want a 25 year old hanging out with me. And I find it hard to believe that women in their 30s have a mutual friend group with you. You may know some of the same people, but that\u2019s not the same thing. \n\nThey told your husband something in confidence. He told you - whatever, that\u2019s fine, you\u2019re married and probably tell each other everything. Nothing wrong with that. But your message back to them was for no reason other than making them feel bad because your feelings were hurt. There was no reason for it. You could have ignored it and just conducted yourself accordingly. For that, YTA.", "Yta. They have made it very clear they do not want to hang out with you. They were trying  to be polite and keep drama out of the family.  Figure it out and leave them alone.", "NTA. They r two faced. Don't hang with them anymore.", "They should have been straight up about not wanting to hang with you but it seems like you can\u2019t take a hint.. let it go they obviously don\u2019t like you much.", "Leave them alone, they don't want anything to do with you.", "NTA they just don\u2019t want to hang around you and that\u2019s fine.\n\n> He didn't like that and put them in their place.\n\nI think your husband is a bit of an ass here acting like he\u2019s in charge of who has to spend time with who.\n\nThe sisters who don\u2019t want to hang out should\u2019ve just been more clear about it.", "YTA. \n\nYour husband told you how his sisters felt. Rather than accepting their feelings, you went behind his back, to try to gaslight his sisters by guilt-tripping them into feeling bad for you. From an outside POV, this was very childish. YTA", "YTA\n\n Honestly your text was a little passive aggressive and i get the feeling that you want them to fall on their knees and apologize to you. There was no need to send them anything, but you wanted them to feel bad for... idk, having a life without you.", "NTA, however...  Hang out with a 16 year old and see how much you have to explain to them and how frustrating it is to get them to see basic perspective to see how hard this is for your SILs.

It was something with mutual friends.\n\nNow don't get me wrong. You can have friends that are as close as family. My family has family friends that we do consider family.

I'm just saying that if they were, that's a problem.\n\nPlus, it doesn't sound like \"sometimes\" they want \"family time\". It sounds like most of the time they were excluding you.\n\nI'm also confused a little on the phone thing. Is it just the two SILs that live further away that you talk with, or does it include the one that lives nearby too?", "Family time is one thing when its just the 2 of them but not wanting you with other ppl is strange . I was rather wondering if you joined their friendsgroup chat and then someone made a new one without you . I mean how many other ppl are not in this chat  aka what kind of chat is that ? I mean if its like a mama chat where all the moms talk and meet it is one thing but if they only cut you out it is cruel . It seems like this one sis doesn't want you around so it may be hard to invite you without pissing off the one sis while the other one is fine with you", ">They haven't invited op to anything they've done yet.\n\nSo? They're sisters, it makes sense that they want to spend some time between them or with their friends. Just because their brother married op doesn't mean they have to include her in everything.
