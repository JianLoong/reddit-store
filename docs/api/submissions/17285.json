If he decides to spend more than the given budget he is in charge to cover the leftover.", "NTA. He knew up front what the budget was and went way over anyway. Tell him forget it, get your money back, and don't go on the cruise. I would have done that from the start and just said book something we can afford or we don't go, that simple.", "NTA.  He can't just randomly decide to spend more of your money.  $500 was more than generous to chip in to the cause...", "NTA\n\nIf you buy a gift as a group, you all need to agree on the gift and the amount given. He went ahead with his own plan when he already knew it was more expensive that you'd agreed to, so he has to live with the consequences. Time to put your foot down and say that you'll pay what you agreed to and no more.", "NTA you have 0 obligation to help someone else buy a gift for a third party. The reasons don't matter. BUT since you are expecting you need all the money you can get. It's not your fault that BIL went and did all that. He can pay the remainder of he so chooses. But you're NTA in this situation.", "NTA. You gave him a budget he ignored it and booked a luxury cruise for FIL and MIL. He knows your household income is reduced due to you being on maternity leave and you gave him $100 over the budget you\u2019d given him.\nHe decided to not talk to his sister or your husband before confirming the booking and that it was affordable for everyone which it clearly is not. \nHe should have to pay the difference and learn the lesson", "NTA.

What happened to FIL pitching in?", "Oooh I misread that, even more NTA. WTF?", "FIL has a \u201chabit of promising things then reneging and refusing at a later date\u201d. huh. And your BIL ignored your budget. \n\nWell. Sounds like this is a BIL problem. \n\nIt would be *too bad* if the expensive cruise gets cancelled and something from Carnival Cruises was booked. \n\nA one minute search found a three day cruise to the Bahamas for under $400 for two people. (Now I\u2019m sure this doesn\u2019t include airfare or a balcony! Lol, but if there is a budget and FIL won\u2019t contribute, well, it\u2019s a *cruise*, what do you *want*???)", "So it seems that FIL is now contributing a quarter. $675x4 is the total cost of $2700. I know $675 is better than $900 but it is still much more than we expected.", "I still think it\u2019s ridiculous. He can wait (forever) for the remaining $175 since you already gave $500. I can\u2019t believe that BIL thought this was okay. \nNow, here\u2019s the big question. Do you/hubby get to go on this splendid vacay?", "Nope! This cruise is solely for my MIL and FIL to go on together. Hence why I was shocked at the cost of it!", "See, I\u2019d get it if you were all going as a family. Nice trip, special day kinda thing. I would also get it if you were all paying for your MIL \u2026 but your FIL should be paying for his trip, period. Why does he get to sail for 1/4 of the price if no one else gets this trip? So, the 2,800 should have been cut directly in half for the FIL\u2019s portion. THEN the remaining 1,400 be divided 4 ways. Any way you slice that cake, even if he didn\u2019t pay anything towards MILs trip, you\u2019ve already paid more than your fair share."]}
