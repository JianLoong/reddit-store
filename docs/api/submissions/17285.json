As the family member who sometimes organizes communal gifts for my mom, I always get firm commitments from my siblings and the amounts they\u2019re willing or able to pitch in. Then, I calculate if I can personally afford my share and my older brother\u2019s share as he always commits and has never once actually paid me. My younger brother and I usually cover my older brother\u2019s share (don\u2019t want to bother our busy sister with his crap) and still sign his name on the card. Our mom knows how he is though and always thanks my younger brother and I privately while implying she knows we likely covered his portion. We could leave him out but he\u2019d act like a martyr and since our mom knows he contributed literally nothing it doesn\u2019t bother us to pretend and avoid the dramatics.\n\nAll that to say, your BIL wants to take credit for doing something great and special for the in laws but isn\u2019t willing to work within the parameters the rest of you have set. If he wanted to go beyond the amount everyone said they could contribute, he needs to cover the additional cost himself.", "Facing a similar situation right now.  I believe that someone purchasing something without talking to others does not mean that I am obligated to pay money.  Even worse, your BIL knew there were constraints and ignored them, figuring that you and the others would cave.  Your BIL deciding that each couple should pay a certain amount is totally irrelevant because you never agreed to it.  In my case, I'm not paying anything additional because I know if I do this now, it will happen again.  No one - family or otherwise - is entitled to my money except my husband.  Good luck!", "NTA. You told him your budget and he chose to buy a more expensive trip. Pay what you told him you would and tell him that is what you said you could pay. He bought the more expensive trip; he gets to pay the difference.", "NTA I don't know what kind of cruise your BIL booked but\n\ncruises are cheap right now. He went over budget so\n\nlet him make up the difference.", "NTA", "Nope.  He doesn't get to be the hero on your dime.  NTA and this should be a valuable lesson to him about ASKING other people for their money, not demanding it.", "Not the a hole. He put you all in a pinch and is trying to pass the buck, literally.", "YWNBTA.  Going over budget without checking in first was his decision.  You told him how much you could contribute and he chose to go over that amount.  He must love them very much to spend his own money on this top of the line cruise, instead of settling for the one everyone agreed to.", "NTA... you not only warned him but you also gave a limit. You exceeded that amount too. His poor planning is not your responsibility", "NTA. Assuming that he chooses to spend more than the given financial plan he is in control to cover the extra.", "He should be held responsible for the missing amount.", "Not the a hole. He put you all in a pinch and is trying to pass the buck, literally.", "Exactly this. If you\u2019d agreed to $400, and SIL $200, then he went in knowing anything over $600 he\u2019d have to cover himself. Booking a $2700 cruise was entirely his own decision, and he needs to pay for the rest of it. You were clear, and you\u2019ve already been more than understanding and generous in giving him an additional 25% of what you\u2019d agreed. \n\nNTA, and don\u2019t feel an iota of guilt for not paying anymore. He does not have the right to choose how much money you spend.", "My uncles cruise all the time, they've never paid close to $2700 for a cruise and they normally do 12 day Southern Caribbean cruises.", "And as a bonus gift, she graciously offered to take the old TV that didn't need replacing off your FIL's hands?", "$2,700 for two people.  That\u2019s $1,350 per person which is not that much for a decent cruise.  Sure, there are deals with better prices, but $2,700 isn\u2019t unrealistic.", "[removed]", "I think she just ate the difference which is why she was salty about it. She just shit her pants and went to Costco and the was shocked later on when we couldn't help.", "Their last cruise, I think it was Carnival, maybe RC, was free, a gift from the Casino onboard. I guess they do only cruise with deals. But they've cruised so much that they get amazing deals from the cruiselines.", "He had to seriously upgrade their room and pay for excursions. My uncles have done a lot of 12 day Southern Caribbean cruises and it's never cost them near $2700.", "NTA.", "you gave a budget, and a reasonable boundary, and he chose to duck around and find out.\n\nnot your circus, not your monkeys, NTA", "NTA. You had a budget that you clearly communicated. If BIL goes over it then it's on him to supplement the funds if the other contributors can't or won't kick in more. You paid your share already you owe him nothing. He made the decision without consulting all the paying parties and without authorization to go higher.", "NTA. He went over a budget that was priority agreed upon. Not sure what he expected to happen. Kind of a dumb move on his end because now he\u2019s stuck with the extra.", "NTA. You would not be the asshole if you refused to pay the rest. \n\nIf I understand this correctly, you did not just agree to contribute equally to a cruise. You agreed to contribute $400 at most to a cruise.\n\nIt is irrelevant as to whether you are the asshole, but FIL agreeing to pay any balance should mean BIL has nothing more to ask from you. Perhaps the balance is more than FIL is willing to pay, but that all falls back on BIL for booking a cruise multiple people were expected to contribute to without verifying with those people that the price was acceptable.\n\nPerhaps your husband can call his father to find out WTF is going on, since your BIL keeps changing the expectations.", "I'm gonna be that guy and say ESH, because it sounds like I'm hearing a story about a bunch of people who are in fairly dire financial straits who are nonetheless for some reason trying to find a way to pay for an expensive cruise.  \nThe fuck?", "NTA. Don\u2019t pay him another dime. You already contributed more than your communicated budget. You told him what you could afford and he didn\u2019t respect that, that is on him.", "NTA", "nta - you told him what you could afford and he ignored you.  I would give him the 400 and tell  him that is what you committed to, and that is what you are contributing.  Let him shell out the difference.", "This is a wildly extravagant gift even for a 60th birthday. NTA", "NTA.  You set a limit and then gave another $100 beyond what you were comfortable.  He didn\u2019t stay on budget; it is not your responsibility to cover.", "NTA  lt is now his gift  You said 400.00 and did 500.00  You are on leave and this is not your responsiblity.", "NTA and you should have stuck to the 400$. Its on him to find the shortfall.", "NTA! His idea...he can pay for it.", "NTA. What kind of person disregards someone's budget, doesn't even check in with them about upping their limit and just books it anyway, expecting you to pay? I cannot for the life of me understand the way some people think.", "NTA If BIL could not find a cruise within the specified budget\u2026 then perhaps the cruise was not the appropriate gift. Or he should have paid for the whole thing.", "Absolutely.", "He cannot spend your money without your informed consent.", "He wants the credit and glory on your dime. Let him cover the costs.", "Not really relevant though. If the family couldn't afford a cruise the BIL should have booked something else", "Nope lol FIL put it in the basement where they never use it!! MIL doesn't really give things away unless they are garbage and just aren't good enough to be inside her house at which point she will offer it up to us. Cuz ya know apparently I like garbage in my place! On the off chance she has something we could actually use and it's in fantastic condition and she will give it away to SIL or someone who can easily afford to buy themselves one of their own. She's that kind of person.", "Bot"]}
