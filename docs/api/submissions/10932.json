This is done so that, if they do hit a patch of turbulence, you can't sue them if you were out of your seat. What it means *practically* is that people will get up when the seatbelt sign is on because if it's been on for 3 hours, chances are someone's going to need the lav.

Back in my heavy flying days, it was regular for me to fly at least 4 days a week. It was the opposite of fun, and I certainly couldn't do it at my current age, but it was what it was.\n\nI have been on a plane when we hit an air pocket, and the stewardess who was in the aisle literally flew up to the ceiling and stayed pressed up against it until we stopped falling out of the sky. She then dropped to the ground like a box of rocks, and I wouldn't be surprised if she got hurt because although she managed to get herself up, we never saw her again for the rest of the flight.  So I always have my seat belt on unless I am getting up. Because you never know.\n\nHowever, people who try to get up to go to the restroom when the seatbelt sign is on are typically needing to go to the restroom.

But there could be very real consequences to your refusal. I have seen it happen.\n\nBut your seat mate is not an a****** either. You don't know what they needed, and that's not your business anyway. But you could have let them out, and if they had been having an emergency you would not have liked the repercussions. Whether that meant they screamed in your face, or vomited in your lap.\n\nI realize your fear had you very focused on one repercussion. But you're an adult and you know that life has many paths. If you had considered the fact that they might vomit on you, would you still have refused?\n\nTMI \nIn case it's really important to you, I have thrown up on a plane, I have thrown up a lot on a plane. I ended up with a virus in a work city we were at, and it hit me in the plane. If the person had refused, and I had to argue with them, I definitely would have vomited all over them. And then vomited some more, and some more, and some more. To be clear, I lost 8 lb in 24 hours, That's a lot of vomit.", "I agree they should get a window seat in the future, but your reply is pretty harsh. Clearly OP isn't as comfortable/doesn't fly as much as you.", "Since the seatbelt sign was on (and the plane was landing), the flight attendant would have told you to be seated :)", "If he doesn't want to be in that position then a window seat CAN be a solution.

So your aisle might have 6-10 bags or maybe only 2 bags.", "Descent takes a long time, and the last call for lavs can happen well after the nose goes down. Getting out of your seat is only \"generally\" prohibited below 10,000 feet (only a few minutes before the wheels touch down), and even that low, if you are sick, you can hit your call button and be allowed to use the lav (that actually happened last summer, I stood out of my aisle seat less than 2 minutes before touchdown so the FA could escort the passenger in the middle to the lav so they didn't make a mess elsewhere...I felt bad for her since being ill anywhere is hard, but on a plane is especially tough!).\n\nI have flown damn near 300,000 miles in my life, and get up all the time when the seatbelt sign is on, specifically because I prefer to sit in an aisle seat. Unless things go completely sideways, I won't be in a middle or window, but if that happened and you refused to get up and let me use the lav when the seatbelt sign is on and it's get up now or have an accident in my seat, I would literally crawl over you. I have been on long-hauls where the seatbelt sign was on for 6+ consecutive hours...and I am not going to apologize for needing to pee during those 6 hours! If you are that hardcore about the rules, again, take the window, then no one will ask you to \"violate\" the seatbelt sign.", "Totally agree. Seen videos where in one second, all hell breaks loose!  Of course, that could mean OP might be vomited on or worse by blocking passage, but it is risk/reward decision all need to make for themselves.", "Well its not OPs job to tell another passenger what to do though. They can stand and allow the other passenger to get up. If a FA tells him to sit, then its not OPs fault.", "And if the seat belt sign isn't on that's all fine and dandy and I agree iwith your statement.\n\nHowever the seat belt sign was **ON**  If the middle seat passenger had a problem then they should have called the flight attendant.  Additionally, the plane was descending, presumably to land, if that was the case, then usually the flight attendants don't allow passengers to use the toilet anyway because its *dangerous*", "Depends. I've never had someone stop me from going (I try to always sit in the aisle) but I have gone right after the sign turned back on because I'd been waiting for the person in the bathroom to exit and return to their seat before going and the FA said \"if it's not an emergency, please return to your seat,\" and I said \"It kind of is, is it okay if I go fast?\" and she said that was fine.", "And another solution is that Mr. Tiny Bladder can buy aisle seats.", "Then why should his cheapness be OP's problem to fix?", "This is a fair assessment, but for what it\u2019s worth it wasn\u2019t one of those flights where the sign was on for hours. It was a 3.5 hour flight and it wasn\u2019t on at any point after takeoff until the moment I\u2019m writing about. I think I\u2019d likely have reacted differently if it had been on the whole time.", "Well, that\u2019s why I found it to be an interesting question for AITA. I\u2019m not really interested in policing other people, but in this instance I couldn\u2019t avoid doing so without breaking the rule myself (and more importantly compromising my own safety).", "> They can stand and\n\nBut the OP said\n\n>  The seatbelt sign was on and the flight attendants had come on the mic a few times reminding people to please not get up.\n\nSo how can the stand up and still follow the signs and what the flight attendant said?", "But if they take their seatbelt off on the one second when turbulence hit, they could literally break their neck. What are you not understanding about why these rules are in place.  If middle aisle guy is desperate, let him risk all & climb over aisle guy.", "You do realize that if they stand up to let the person out then OP themselves are now breaking the rules? It's not about telling the other person to not get up. It's about how OP won't get up because it's against the rules. The fact that it impacts the other person is immaterial", "The FA will quickly reprimand if they don\u2019t want them walking down the aisle and the seatbelt sign is normally on unless you are in the middle cruising altitude and beginning of initial descent part of the flight\u2026", "Fair enough.

If you can find that button, you can remain seated, flip the armrest up, and turn your legs into the aisle to let other passengers out of your row. I still think that a window is a better choice, if possible, but you could provide some minor accommodation without getting up if in an aisle.", "There was severe turbulence on Wednesday eve. Seatbelt light went on. I\u2019m on aisle. Woman needs to get out - I get out and let her walk down the aisle. Not one FA yelled. Pee in seats is bad.

I remember I was on a flight as a kid where someone did the same as OP and would not allow a child get out of the row to the bathroom.

If middle seat man had an issue with OP not standing up or ridiculously manoeuvring themselves to allow them out, then he should have buzzed for the FA and had the conversation with them about suitability to use the restroom, OP has no obligation to comply with his request above a safety announcement.  Some pilots will be overly cautious and have the seatbelt sign on for longer duration or limited turbulence - others will be expecting that turbulence is about to get worse - none of these passengers are in a position to guess this, and clearly the FA were unhappy that other people had gotten up when the sign was on from the comment about their multiple warnings to others.", "Please take the window. All y'all! I will stand up for you.

OP stated in another comment that it was only the beginning of the descent (prob 30 min to landing), and turbulence was mild. The fasten seatbelt sign is turned on to ensure that there is no unnecessary moving about the cabin, and that if you\u2019re sitting you should keep it on. This does NOT preclude someone from using the restroom unless in very specific circumstances listed above.

I flew well over a million miles, and had top status with three of the legacy airlines.  As an experienced flyer, I ALWAYS kept my seatbelt on, because I know that turbulence can be sudden, unpredictable and, occasionally dangerous.  I've seen people bounce off the ceiling, get hit by beverage carts, or get slammed by unsecured \"personal items.\"  You are also wrong.  The seatbelt sign on ascent and descent is turned on, not because the crew doesn't want \"unnecessary moving about the cabin,\" but because take off and landing are the most dangerous parts of a flight and what otherwise might have been a smooth flight may experience severe turbulence at lower altitudes.  I've experienced my share of sudden downdrafts and updrafts, and crabbed or bounced landings.  Only the pilot knows why the seatbelt sign is necessary.  Sometimes the pilot will announce the reason, sometimes the pilot will notify the flight attendants, and sometimes the pilot will simply turn on the sign.  You, as a passenger, even one who is a frequent flyer, has no idea unless there's a specific announcement.  Sure, there were plenty of times when I needed the lav badly on descent, but I always asked an FA before getting up.  If they told me, \"We can't allow you, but if you do go be careful,\"  I'd get up.  If they said, \"Better not -- it's going to get pretty rough,\" I didn't.  \n\n\nBTW, if you're a frequent flyer, you would know that descent from cruise takes a minimum of 20-30 minutes, even on a relatively short flight from a lower altitude, and that ascent to cruise, or even 10,000 feet (which is when the pilot normally turns off the seatbelt sign) is 10-15 minutes.  5 minutes?  What do you fly, rocket ships?", "OP refused because the seatbelts signs were on and there had been an announcement specifically telling everyone to sit the f down. Social contract does not apply in this case.", "Have you been on a flight? When the seatbelt sign is on, the lavatories aren\u2019t accessible and they definitely aren\u2019t accessible when landing.

And then its at your own risk. \n\nIn your case you had turbulence, so i highly doubt the captain would allowed that man to go to the toilet anyway, even if you let him out of his seat.

May you be treated the way you want to treat others by denying them access to a bathroom when they need it.", "It\u2019s nothing like traffic lights and far closer to a request. \n\nIf you need to go a flight attendant will not stop you unless the plane is literally about to takeofff/land or there is extreme turbulence.", "I hope you poop yourself today", "That\u2019s unfortunately a risk you take with flying. Same with flying with high blood pressure, motion sickness, etc. You go in knowing there will be times you will be in situations that, for safety, you cannot avoid. If you can prepare for them, you should. If you can\u2019t, you deal.", "If you have to use the restroom, feel free. \n\nOP would have been standing for a total of 30 seconds..", "Definitely not what OP was going through though? Lol I\u2019m not sitting next to someone who pissed their pants don\u2019t worry an air marshal isn\u2019t going to arrest you for using the restroom.", "It\u2019s a joke. Yknow like pissing your pants out of fear. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re fun at parties.", "Take that risk? Getting up for 15 seconds and then again to let them back in? Y\u2019all people act like OP would have to traverse the entire plane", "Yeah, and shit or pee yourself in a packed plane, have to deplane and walk the airport stinking everything up. Thats messed up.  Maybe you enjoy humiliating people.   It's apparent the lack of empathy for others.", "Speaking as someone going through a UC flare up right now, the amount of \"I have 20 seconds to get to a bathroom else I'm going to shit myself\" I deal with would have had me absolutely crawling over OP to get to the bathroom if they refused to move. We don't have a whole lot of warning or control over when this happens if we're flaring.", "It\u2019s because people don\u2019t realize that quite often when the pilot says we are starting our initial descent and puts the seatbelt sign on it gives everyone around 5 minutes ish to either pop up and pee, put your laptop away in the overhead, ensure all your items are discarded. Etc. if you are afraid of being up and making way briefly for someone to do these things - just stay near the window - it\u2019s ok\u2026", "That\u2019s on that passenger then? OP would be up for 30seconds total..", "That\u2019s kind of my thought too. You know if i really needed to go and someone didn\u2019t stand up I wouldn\u2019t appreciate that. Yes, safety rules are safety rules but you\u2019re going to all have to stand up for a lot longer than 30seconds if someone has an accident\u2026the chairs are connected and I\u2019ve witnessed it first hand.", "And that\u2019s all it takes to get thrown several rows and receive injury and OP would have to take that risk twice. The rules exist for a reason. You don\u2019t know the dangers until you\u2019re facing the fallout of it.", "Lol, I have totally opted to avoid drinking any liquids in that scenario!", "Same Foggy. Same. That's why I even thought of it. I can only wish you good luck and better health. \ud83e\udd1e\ud83d\ude4f", "Doesn\u2019t matter if it is 1sec. She doesn\u2019t have to break the rules or take on any addition risk if she doesn\u2019t want to. Trough beans for the other guy.", "Lol everyone acting like the plane was experiencing some very severe turbulence. Shit is situational and OP would have been fine, and really shouldn\u2019t be flying if it get them like that.", "Yeah, but this is ahole behavior.", "They were descending. Yes. That\u2019s dangerous levels of turbulence in the smoothest of flights. It\u2019s also pretty easy to predict when it will occur and is often called out in advance by the flight crew to warn passengers before the seatbelt light comes on.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/HDN7KGNNTnw\n\nhttps://youtu.be/W-63nuU9ZBY", "No it\u2019s not. However, asking someone to risk their safety for your comfort is.", "By the person that expects someone else to break rules and take injury risk for their benefit, yes, it is AH behavior.", "Yea and often times lines form and you can\u2019t get to the bathroom, or you get sick, everyone here is really making a mountain over a mole hill. Just ask a flight attendant first, if it\u2019s bad they will tell you no but more often than not it\u2019s more than okay..", "They were not in danger.. Christ people like OP make flying more stressful for everyone. \n\nThey would have to stand up and then sit down..", "Endanger themselves Jesus Christ y\u2019all are dramatic", "Yes. The \"back door opens\".", "Yes ask. And OP said the flight attendants said to stay seated. So what\u2019s your point?\n\nWhen you are on a flight, your actions affect the safety of others. You have to take into account your own safety and comfort, but it is also your responsibility to accommodate the safety of others. Final descent: You stay seated even if you are about to pee your pants. I\u2019ve done it. It sucked and it hurt, but I\u2019ve done it. Then after that, I watched my fluid intake and used the restroom at certain points regardless of I thought I needed to. That\u2019s the responsibility aspect of shared travel.", "Why do they need to tell strangers why they need to use the bathroom?!", "It's not my job to detail my disease to strangers. This is incredibly ableist and the equivalent of implying that someone with an invisible disability needs to justify using handicapped parking spots.", "YTA.\n\nIf you are going to be this rigid with not unbuckling while the sign is on, that's your right, but you should always take a window seat. You don't belong in an aisle seat.\n\nThere are any number of medical reasons a person might NEED to get up during the flight. Yes, rules are rules, and safety is important, but this safety rule is one that is general and cannot account for 100% of cases, and you should have been a little flexible here.\n\nYes, there is a SLIGHT danger. But if a hijacker pulls out a weapon you better believe people need to get up and do something even if the seatbelt sign is on. If a passenger has a heart attack, a doctor can't be expected to say \"Op, sorry, sign is on\". So right there we see that this is not a 100% rule.\n\nA person shitting themselves on a plane does not rise to the level of terrorism obviously, but it's enough of an urgency to warrant you getting up for just a few seconds to save your fellow passenger potentially extreme discomfort.", "NAH. I see your point but the guy could have been ill. Part of taking an aisle seat is being willing to get up whenever the window person wants to get out.", "NTA", "This is why if I\u2019m traveling alone, I buy the window seat or the bigger front seats so if the person next to me has to pass, they can", "I probably would not have stood up, but I would have moved my knees to one side to make it easier for them to move past me....", "I'm gonna say NAH.\n\nOf course you're not wrong for not getting up when you weren't meant to be standing, but there are plenty of reasons he may have really needed to go. \n\nI'm currently heavily pregnant with my second child, and I've been SHOCKED at how decreased my ability to \"hold it\" has been this time. I'd have crawled right over you, tbh, cuz it's either that or we're both gonna be wet in about 2 minutes. There are plenty of GI conditions that could also be at play and cause someone to be pretty adamant about getting up.\n\nObviously, the best solution is to try and reserve yourself an aisle seat if you have some particular reason to need the bathroom frequently or quickly, but unfortunately, it sounds like it's becoming more common to not be given the seats you've selected on a flight and you don't always have control over your seating.", "clearly NTA. \nand most times when u are asked to fasten ur seatbelt and when u are descending u cant use the restroom", "This has come up a few times, so answering here. We were on Spirit Airlines, so it was extremely cramped and neither of us were small people. I\u2019d have had no problem letting him squeeze by me if they were feasible.", "They were starting the descent so turbulence can change rapidly. I was on a flight a few months ago we had little to no turbulence and as we started descent we got jolted forward and i nearly hit my head on the tray table. This is why i will not be doing a lap child. Turbulence can occur very rapidly especially in landing", "Tell them not to complain about the pee soaked seat then lololol just pee on it whatever", "What if he has a medical condition?", "Hiw would you feel if i just shit and pissed myself next to you then because no one could get up?", "What would you guys do if someone just cant hold it anymore and pees themselves in the seat? You better not charge them", "Would they arrest you if you pissed on the seat? Because you couldnt hold it any longer?", "Apperantly reddit expects humans to just sit in their own bodily exceements .", "I\u2019m plus size, so I can understand that. I\u2019ve still never had a real issue with someone getting by who really needed to though. I fly southwest domestically and United and delta internationally for the most part. \n\nHighly recommend the window for your next trip.", "They were beginning descending and flight attendants specifically said don't do that. And the guy tried to do exactly hat was said not to do.", "Yeah, I kinda hinted on that to be fair. But I get why a pregnant person standing on a plane amidst turbulence is a bad idea. Better pissed than hurt\n\nEdit: words were missing.", "Be an adult, and time your ablutions to match when the light is off. It\u2019s not difficult", "If you didn't call the flight attendant first, probably.", "Id demand the airline replace the backpack since they caused the kid to pee and damage it", "Honestly I wouldn\u2019t have minded if he wanted to attempt to climb over or squeeze past me. I just didn\u2019t want to get up myself.", "Well lets hope the passengers who have to endure her pee also dont sue her. I live in florida. People sie eachother for not wearing the right shoes it seems like now.", "But if we were following the law by the seatbelt signnhow can they charge you for following the law? You can only hold your pee for so long", "In that case, wouldn\u2019t you deliberately reserve your seat on the aisle closest to the bathroom, just as a matter of course? Or at the very least, tell the refuser it\u2019s an emergency?", "don't blame you and he could have done that - imo you did no wrong", "Do you often see people walking around the plane when the sign is on? Here in Europe they chase you back to your seat.", "Because thinking adults are expected to ask for assistance when required and petulantly pissing your pants because your interpretation of the law told you to is the definition of 'disturbing the peace'.\n\nLook if when you got up and were questioned you said you really had to go it would be fine but that depends on the flight attendant really. Once a dude got arrested for stretching his back a lot on a flight. It was a mistake but it still happened.", "Right now? I would have made sure I got an aisle seat, yeah. I don't feel like I should have to tell anyone other than the FA why I need to go now, though. I'm an adult. If I say I need to go, I need to *go.* I also generally don't have time to explain WHY I need to go, that's how urgent it is. The times that the two bathrooms closest to me at work are both taken are terrifying, and I'm not above using the men's restroom if the women's is occupied. \n\nBut someone who was freshly diagnosed or undiagnosed and in the beginning stages of their first flare up might not have that level of awareness. That's a rough, confusing and embarrassing period of time.", "Hope they dont punish people if they pee on the seats", "So what do they do? Baby carry you down the isle?", "Understood. Sorry you\u2019re going through that.", "ESH, but I've got to tell you, if I need to go to the bathroom, I'm going, even if I have to crawl over you. \nI try to only purchase aisle seats because I get up to use the bathroom or walk up and down on long flights. But having an aisle seat is not permission to hold the rest of the row prisoner.", "NTA. But to avoid conflict with rule-ignoring idiots, stick to the window seat.", "To be fair, I didn\u2019t get up and he did not appear to shit himself between that moment and landing. So we do know on some level.", "Food poisoning happens. It certainly has to me. If I had the gift of foresight I would of course have picked an aisle\ud83d\udcbaon that flight", "If someone says it\u2019s an emergency, we never say no. And people puke and other things in the seat sometimes, especially little kids. Not charged, and it all gets changed at the next station or the seat is pulled out of service until an overnight.", "Yeah, I\u2019ve been in this position. I have IBS.", "You deal by defecating yourself?  If it's landing , perhaps but just initial descent is a risk ill take..it can be another hour before u can use a bathroom...", "It\u2019s all circumstantial, the decent takes time and if you really need to go they will let you and no you won\u2019t kill everyone in the plane bouncing around.", "/sigh\u2026 please do not equate IBS to UC or crohns. There is a massive difference and I hope you never personally get to experience the difference. \n\nBefore my UC first hit, I had IBS and thought it was terrible. It would make me miserable at times. Gods it was nothing. \n\nIf you\u2019ve ever had food poisoning, multiply that and make it last for the rest of your life. Hoping each day the meds will keep the next flare up away or at least allow you to function, hopefully make it through 8 hours of work without having to run to the restroom 20 times. Afraid of eating almost anything in case it could trigger something. Missing out on family events because the car ride is too long, live performances where it\u2019s rude to get up and impossible to return to your seat, making sure you know where the restrooms are any times you\u2019re going some place new. Unable to sleep from the pain. Cutting out massive portions of your diet until you learn what your body will tolerate because, guess what, everyone is different and one person can eat fruits just fine when another can\u2019t touch them unless they\u2019re canned or otherwise cooked. Your favorite foods you cannot eat again without major physical consequences. Try going 6 months with only half a dozen things you can eat without agony and see how you feel. The difference between IBS and IBD is the difference between a couple of clouds in the sky and a massive downpour lasting days.", "Then go regularly while the seatbelt light is off, bring a change of clothes, or don\u2019t expect others to assume risk for you. That really is the crux of it: don\u2019t be entitled.", "Yes they say that over the speaker, you CAN get up if you really need to go. It\u2019s all circumstantial. \n\nSometimes shit comes unexpectedly and you need to go, again not black and white rules.", "If they say you can get up, then you can. If, as OP stated in the information presented to us\n\n>the flight attendants had come on the mic a few times reminding people not to get up\n\nthen you do not get up. It is that black and white. You\u2019re bringing up completely unrelated circumstances. Flight attendants aren\u2019t there to play mind games with you. They\u2019re there to keep you safe. If they tell you to stay seated, stay seated."]}
