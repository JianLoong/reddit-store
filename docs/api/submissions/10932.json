Some airlines have started leaving the seatbelt sign on for most of the flight if there is turbulence forecast. This is done so that, if they do hit a patch of turbulence, you can't sue them if you were out of your seat. What it means *practically* is that people will get up when the seatbelt sign is on because if it's been on for 3 hours, chances are someone's going to need the lav. If the crew are actively enforcing the seatbelt sign with repeated reminders, it's a good sign that there is reported turbulence of a moderate to severe nature.", "NTA.

It\u2019s not your job to second guess whether the rule is really in force at any given moment.  Sit down, shit up, and don\u2019t expect other people to ignore rules and flight crew instructions for you.\n\nThe OP would be the first person standing up, and therefore the first person yelled at by the flight crew.\n\nIf you want to ignore crew instructions, it\u2019s probably best for you to sit on the aisle, so that you don\u2019t have to force others to ignore them, too.", "Finally someone who flies enough to know it\u2019s a social contract.

Sitting there is a social contract. If you are an afraid person no exit seat no aisle seat - go next to the window!", "Agreed NAH\n\nI have flown a lot. Back in my heavy flying days, it was regular for me to fly at least 4 days a week. It was the opposite of fun, and I certainly couldn't do it at my current age, but it was what it was.\n\nI have been on a plane when we hit an air pocket, and the stewardess who was in the aisle literally flew up to the ceiling and stayed pressed up against it until we stopped falling out of the sky. She then dropped to the ground like a box of rocks, and I wouldn't be surprised if she got hurt because although she managed to get herself up, we never saw her again for the rest of the flight.  So I always have my seat belt on unless I am getting up. Because you never know.\n\nHowever, people who try to get up to go to the restroom when the seatbelt sign is on are typically needing to go to the restroom. If I asked you to please let me out when the seat belt sign was on, and you didn't, you would have been wearing my vomit.\n\nSo you aren't an a******. But there could be very real consequences to your refusal. I have seen it happen.\n\nBut your seat mate is not an a****** either. You don't know what they needed, and that's not your business anyway. But you could have let them out, and if they had been having an emergency you would not have liked the repercussions. Whether that meant they screamed in your face, or vomited in your lap.\n\nI realize your fear had you very focused on one repercussion. But you're an adult and you know that life has many paths. If you had considered the fact that they might vomit on you, would you still have refused?\n\nTMI \nIn case it's really important to you, I have thrown up on a plane, I have thrown up a lot on a plane. I ended up with a virus in a work city we were at, and it hit me in the plane. If the person had refused, and I had to argue with them, I definitely would have vomited all over them. And then vomited some more, and some more, and some more. To be clear, I lost 8 lb in 24 hours, That's a lot of vomit.", "I agree they should get a window seat in the future, but your reply is pretty harsh. Clearly OP isn't as comfortable/doesn't fly as much as you.", "Since the seatbelt sign was on (and the plane was landing), the flight attendant would have told you to be seated :)", "If he doesn't want to be in that position then a window seat CAN be a solution.  Never said he NEEDS to do it.", "Because middle seats are usually cheaper? \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "From my experience most do, but they aren\u2019t always restocked between flights when the cabin is cleaned. So your aisle might have 6-10 bags or maybe only 2 bags.", "Descent takes a long time, and the last call for lavs can happen well after the nose goes down. Getting out of your seat is only \"generally\" prohibited below 10,000 feet (only a few minutes before the wheels touch down), and even that low, if you are sick, you can hit your call button and be allowed to use the lav (that actually happened last summer, I stood out of my aisle seat less than 2 minutes before touchdown so the FA could escort the passenger in the middle to the lav so they didn't make a mess elsewhere...I felt bad for her since being ill anywhere is hard, but on a plane is especially tough!).\n\nI have flown damn near 300,000 miles in my life, and get up all the time when the seatbelt sign is on, specifically because I prefer to sit in an aisle seat. Unless things go completely sideways, I won't be in a middle or window, but if that happened and you refused to get up and let me use the lav when the seatbelt sign is on and it's get up now or have an accident in my seat, I would literally crawl over you. I have been on long-hauls where the seatbelt sign was on for 6+ consecutive hours...and I am not going to apologize for needing to pee during those 6 hours! If you are that hardcore about the rules, again, take the window, then no one will ask you to \"violate\" the seatbelt sign.", "Totally agree. Seen videos where in one second, all hell breaks loose!  Of course, that could mean OP might be vomited on or worse by blocking passage, but it is risk/reward decision all need to make for themselves.", "Well its not OPs job to tell another passenger what to do though. They can stand and allow the other passenger to get up. If a FA tells him to sit, then its not OPs fault.", "And if the seat belt sign isn't on that's all fine and dandy and I agree iwith your statement.\n\nHowever the seat belt sign was **ON**  If the middle seat passenger had a problem then they should have called the flight attendant.  Additionally, the plane was descending, presumably to land, if that was the case, then usually the flight attendants don't allow passengers to use the toilet anyway because its *dangerous*", "Depends. I've never had someone stop me from going (I try to always sit in the aisle) but I have gone right after the sign turned back on because I'd been waiting for the person in the bathroom to exit and return to their seat before going and the FA said \"if it's not an emergency, please return to your seat,\" and I said \"It kind of is, is it okay if I go fast?\" and she said that was fine.", "And another solution is that Mr. Tiny Bladder can buy aisle seats.", "Then why should his cheapness be OP's problem to fix?", "This is a fair assessment, but for what it\u2019s worth it wasn\u2019t one of those flights where the sign was on for hours. It was a 3.5 hour flight and it wasn\u2019t on at any point after takeoff until the moment I\u2019m writing about. I think I\u2019d likely have reacted differently if it had been on the whole time.", "Well, that\u2019s why I found it to be an interesting question for AITA. I\u2019m not really interested in policing other people, but in this instance I couldn\u2019t avoid doing so without breaking the rule myself (and more importantly compromising my own safety).", "> They can stand and\n\nBut the OP said\n\n>  The seatbelt sign was on and the flight attendants had come on the mic a few times reminding people to please not get up.\n\nSo how can the stand up and still follow the signs and what the flight attendant said?", "But if they take their seatbelt off on the one second when turbulence hit, they could literally break their neck. What are you not understanding about why these rules are in place.  If middle aisle guy is desperate, let him risk all & climb over aisle guy.", "You do realize that if they stand up to let the person out then OP themselves are now breaking the rules? It's not about telling the other person to not get up. It's about how OP won't get up because it's against the rules. The fact that it impacts the other person is immaterial", "The FA will quickly reprimand if they don\u2019t want them walking down the aisle and the seatbelt sign is normally on unless you are in the middle cruising altitude and beginning of initial descent part of the flight\u2026", "Fair enough.  My attitude toward seat belt sign changed after I woke up as plane hit massive air pocket and several people hit the bins and came down with broken bones...", "You can't control other peoples actions, only your own.", "Calming down a little...do you know that there's a button under the armrest of the aisle seat that allows you to flip it up? If you can find that button, you can remain seated, flip the armrest up, and turn your legs into the aisle to let other passengers out of your row. I still think that a window is a better choice, if possible, but you could provide some minor accommodation without getting up if in an aisle.", "There was severe turbulence on Wednesday eve. Seatbelt light went on. I\u2019m on aisle. Woman needs to get out - I get out and let her walk down the aisle. Not one FA yelled. Pee in seats is bad.

I live on planes in turbulence- the patience is aspirational", "I think OP should just stick to saying \"No\" and not let these idiots influence their actions.\n\nEdit: Where does OP specify their gender?", "And I think that peace and quiet during a flight can be very enjoyable. But it comes down to what OP prefers. \n\nP.s. You are right OP didn't specify his/her gender.", "You have no idea what was motivating that man to get up to the RR while there was active turbulence.  Nervous poops/ bladder are a thing and flying can really induce it.

While I don\u2019t think rule following was an AH move here, you could have been a pal and asked if it could wait until after landing, and made your decision from there. It\u2019s a hard call.

I was an air navigator in the Air Force and the seat belt light is for everyone's safety. People have died ignoring them. Being tossed around the cabin due to severe turbulence is no joke.

The pilot will generally indicate people are free to use the lav, but to keep the seatbelt on while seated. This is for safety- unexpected turbulence. Also because it had kind of become a habit for some people to hang out too much in the aisles and food prep area.", "Agree with you. I remember I was on a flight as a kid where someone did the same as OP and would not allow a child get out of the row to the bathroom. Kids mom was helping the kid unbuckle, so parent/child were semi-standing from their seats.

If you are descending, you\u2019ll be passing through various layers in the atmosphere doing different things, creating sheer that will move the plane suddenly.

It was be like getting on a roller coaster without being strapped in.

The stale seatbelt sign the pilot has forgot about is way different than one actively turned on during a turbulence and descent.", "This is so ridiculous. If middle seat man had an issue with OP not standing up or ridiculously manoeuvring themselves to allow them out, then he should have buzzed for the FA and had the conversation with them about suitability to use the restroom, OP has no obligation to comply with his request above a safety announcement.  Some pilots will be overly cautious and have the seatbelt sign on for longer duration or limited turbulence - others will be expecting that turbulence is about to get worse - none of these passengers are in a position to guess this, and clearly the FA were unhappy that other people had gotten up when the sign was on from the comment about their multiple warnings to others.", "Please take the window. All y'all! I will stand up for you. You clearly think other people should soil their pants or throw up in their seat because standing up for 2 seconds to let them out of their seat is dangerous.", "Lol, in real severe turbulence everyone would have white knuckles holding on the seatbelts and armrests, because they think they are going to die.
