This is done so that, if they do hit a patch of turbulence, you can't sue them if you were out of your seat. What it means *practically* is that people will get up when the seatbelt sign is on because if it's been on for 3 hours, chances are someone's going to need the lav.

Back in my heavy flying days, it was regular for me to fly at least 4 days a week. It was the opposite of fun, and I certainly couldn't do it at my current age, but it was what it was.\n\nI have been on a plane when we hit an air pocket, and the stewardess who was in the aisle literally flew up to the ceiling and stayed pressed up against it until we stopped falling out of the sky. She then dropped to the ground like a box of rocks, and I wouldn't be surprised if she got hurt because although she managed to get herself up, we never saw her again for the rest of the flight.  So I always have my seat belt on unless I am getting up. Because you never know.\n\nHowever, people who try to get up to go to the restroom when the seatbelt sign is on are typically needing to go to the restroom.

But there could be very real consequences to your refusal. I have seen it happen.\n\nBut your seat mate is not an a****** either. You don't know what they needed, and that's not your business anyway. But you could have let them out, and if they had been having an emergency you would not have liked the repercussions. Whether that meant they screamed in your face, or vomited in your lap.\n\nI realize your fear had you very focused on one repercussion. But you're an adult and you know that life has many paths. If you had considered the fact that they might vomit on you, would you still have refused?\n\nTMI \nIn case it's really important to you, I have thrown up on a plane, I have thrown up a lot on a plane. I ended up with a virus in a work city we were at, and it hit me in the plane. If the person had refused, and I had to argue with them, I definitely would have vomited all over them. And then vomited some more, and some more, and some more. To be clear, I lost 8 lb in 24 hours, That's a lot of vomit.", "I agree they should get a window seat in the future, but your reply is pretty harsh. Clearly OP isn't as comfortable/doesn't fly as much as you.", "Since the seatbelt sign was on (and the plane was landing), the flight attendant would have told you to be seated :)", "If he doesn't want to be in that position then a window seat CAN be a solution.

So your aisle might have 6-10 bags or maybe only 2 bags.", "Descent takes a long time, and the last call for lavs can happen well after the nose goes down. Getting out of your seat is only \"generally\" prohibited below 10,000 feet (only a few minutes before the wheels touch down), and even that low, if you are sick, you can hit your call button and be allowed to use the lav (that actually happened last summer, I stood out of my aisle seat less than 2 minutes before touchdown so the FA could escort the passenger in the middle to the lav so they didn't make a mess elsewhere...I felt bad for her since being ill anywhere is hard, but on a plane is especially tough!).\n\nI have flown damn near 300,000 miles in my life, and get up all the time when the seatbelt sign is on, specifically because I prefer to sit in an aisle seat. Unless things go completely sideways, I won't be in a middle or window, but if that happened and you refused to get up and let me use the lav when the seatbelt sign is on and it's get up now or have an accident in my seat, I would literally crawl over you. I have been on long-hauls where the seatbelt sign was on for 6+ consecutive hours...and I am not going to apologize for needing to pee during those 6 hours! If you are that hardcore about the rules, again, take the window, then no one will ask you to \"violate\" the seatbelt sign.", "Totally agree. Seen videos where in one second, all hell breaks loose!  Of course, that could mean OP might be vomited on or worse by blocking passage, but it is risk/reward decision all need to make for themselves.", "Well its not OPs job to tell another passenger what to do though. They can stand and allow the other passenger to get up. If a FA tells him to sit, then its not OPs fault.", "And if the seat belt sign isn't on that's all fine and dandy and I agree iwith your statement.\n\nHowever the seat belt sign was **ON**  If the middle seat passenger had a problem then they should have called the flight attendant.  Additionally, the plane was descending, presumably to land, if that was the case, then usually the flight attendants don't allow passengers to use the toilet anyway because its *dangerous*", "Depends. I've never had someone stop me from going (I try to always sit in the aisle) but I have gone right after the sign turned back on because I'd been waiting for the person in the bathroom to exit and return to their seat before going and the FA said \"if it's not an emergency, please return to your seat,\" and I said \"It kind of is, is it okay if I go fast?\" and she said that was fine.", "And another solution is that Mr. Tiny Bladder can buy aisle seats.", "Then why should his cheapness be OP's problem to fix?", "This is a fair assessment, but for what it\u2019s worth it wasn\u2019t one of those flights where the sign was on for hours. It was a 3.5 hour flight and it wasn\u2019t on at any point after takeoff until the moment I\u2019m writing about. I think I\u2019d likely have reacted differently if it had been on the whole time.", "Well, that\u2019s why I found it to be an interesting question for AITA. I\u2019m not really interested in policing other people, but in this instance I couldn\u2019t avoid doing so without breaking the rule myself (and more importantly compromising my own safety).", "> They can stand and\n\nBut the OP said\n\n>  The seatbelt sign was on and the flight attendants had come on the mic a few times reminding people to please not get up.\n\nSo how can the stand up and still follow the signs and what the flight attendant said?", "But if they take their seatbelt off on the one second when turbulence hit, they could literally break their neck. What are you not understanding about why these rules are in place.  If middle aisle guy is desperate, let him risk all & climb over aisle guy.", "You do realize that if they stand up to let the person out then OP themselves are now breaking the rules? It's not about telling the other person to not get up. It's about how OP won't get up because it's against the rules. The fact that it impacts the other person is immaterial", "The FA will quickly reprimand if they don\u2019t want them walking down the aisle and the seatbelt sign is normally on unless you are in the middle cruising altitude and beginning of initial descent part of the flight\u2026", "Fair enough.

If you can find that button, you can remain seated, flip the armrest up, and turn your legs into the aisle to let other passengers out of your row. I still think that a window is a better choice, if possible, but you could provide some minor accommodation without getting up if in an aisle.", "There was severe turbulence on Wednesday eve. Seatbelt light went on. I\u2019m on aisle. Woman needs to get out - I get out and let her walk down the aisle. Not one FA yelled. Pee in seats is bad.

I remember I was on a flight as a kid where someone did the same as OP and would not allow a child get out of the row to the bathroom.

If middle seat man had an issue with OP not standing up or ridiculously manoeuvring themselves to allow them out, then he should have buzzed for the FA and had the conversation with them about suitability to use the restroom, OP has no obligation to comply with his request above a safety announcement.  Some pilots will be overly cautious and have the seatbelt sign on for longer duration or limited turbulence - others will be expecting that turbulence is about to get worse - none of these passengers are in a position to guess this, and clearly the FA were unhappy that other people had gotten up when the sign was on from the comment about their multiple warnings to others.", "Please take the window. All y'all! I will stand up for you.

OP stated in another comment that it was only the beginning of the descent (prob 30 min to landing), and turbulence was mild. The fasten seatbelt sign is turned on to ensure that there is no unnecessary moving about the cabin, and that if you\u2019re sitting you should keep it on. This does NOT preclude someone from using the restroom unless in very specific circumstances listed above.

However you\u2019re right to say the window is your friend to avoid these situations in the future.", "Disobeying aircraft signs is illegal.  NTA", "NTA they wouldn\u2019t let him use the toilet anyway.", "NTA, and surprised he chose this moment to use the bathroom. Turbulence in a bathroom is frightening", "NTA. Anyway, if determined, he probably could\u2019ve squeezed by.", "NTA. If he needed to pee that bad he could have climbed over you.", "NTA. Solidly. \n\nHowever, YWNBTA to get up if you want to meet the Flight Marshall on board.  Yes, violating the FAA rules by disobeying the Flight Crew direct orders is a good way to meet the \"executive branch\" at the airport. \n\nIf OP feels too pressured by the person in the next seat, YWNBTA to offer to call the flight attendant and follow their guidance.  YWNBTA to directly call the flight attendant and ask for their guidance.\n\nYour seat mate was risking getting put on a No Fly list for real, and asking you to do the same.

Several times.", "I believe it's skylaw.", "Yes, I would assume that any person having to go to the restroom during that time *really* needs to go. I'm one of those people who for some reason needs to pee more than normal when I fly even if I try to reduce my intake of fluid. It sucks. It's also not always possible to get an aisle seat and I can't tell you how much I hate to bother people and make them get up but when I have to go I have to go.", "Now, please watch videos what can happen if you are not in your sit with seatbelt on during descend/turbulence/wind shear during landing...", "Nobody should be trying to pee while the airplane is descending. Take offs and landings are the most dangerous parts of flying.\n\nEta: OP's seatmate should have gone pee before the airplane began its descent and the pilot turned on the seat belt sign.", "What the hell? There was turbulence. I have been desperate for the toilet whilst I was sitting in an aisle. And the annoying seat belt sign came on. \n\nI listen to flight attendants. I would prefer to have an accident in my jeans than to bounce around the cabin/bathroom. \n\nYou\u2019re weird.", "Your username should be Turbulent_Impatience_3", "Oh oops. You are correct.", "OR, if the turbulence was really bad, the flight attendant wouldn't have come over at all because you know: for safety reasons everyone should stay seated!", "Yep, I've been very lucky when I occasionally accommodate someone who needs relief, like dozens of times in my life? Did you miss where I've flown enough to circumnavigate the globe almost 10 times? \n\nStanding up for 5 seconds to let someone else out is almost never risky because pilots almost never fly into conditions that would make standing up for those few seconds dangerous. But if you don't want to stand up against the seatbelt sign, I highly recommend selecting a window seat. I select aisles as a personal preference, so I have to get up more. Also as noted, if you do end up in an aisle, you can learn how to lift the aisle arm rest and turn your legs into the aisle to let someone in the middle or window out without removing your seatbelt. \n\nAnd if you refuse to do any of these and for some reason I am not in the aisle, don't be surprised when my crotch is in your face as I climb over you if I am having a restroom emergency and you refuse to even turn your legs into the aisle!", "Lots of people never died despite not wearing a seatbelt in a car their whole life. I literally know someone that still refuses to wear a seatbelt and says the same stupid shit you are here.\n\nEverything else you say here is noise. No one gives a shit how much you have sat in the back seat. It\u2019s like you don\u2019t understand probabilities.\n\nMore over, it doesn\u2019t matter that you think getting up is worth the risk. You aren\u2019t the only one taking the risk. And no, not everyone on an isle has to agree to take that risk either. You needing to pee doesn\u2019t mean anyone else has to take on an extra injury risk. Sorry. Shit down, shut up.", "NTA.  Just a reminder: Failing to follow the instructions of air crew, including fasten seat belt instructions, is a violation of federal law.  Compassion or not, the OP was absolutely right to remain seated with her seatbelt on and refuse to get up.  I don't care how urgent was his need, or how nervous he was.  I'd rather he poop in his pants than become a 200 pound airborne missile if the turbulence turned severe.  His potential embarrassment does not outweigh the safety concerns of the other passengers and crew.", "Pretty sure where I live you can be arrested for not obeying in air safety rules so NTA.", "Flight attendant here. NTA. You followed the rules. They are technically orders, not following them has legal consequences. \nAlso, if someone gets hurt when the seat belt sign is on and you disobeyed direct orders given by the crew, your insurance won\u2019t cover it (not to mention you can be procecuted). \nFAs hate passengers like the guy sitting next to you.", "NTA. You're not supposed to stand up while the sign is on. I was pregnant, desperate for a wee, and was still not allowed to unbuckled until sign was off.", "NTA. You were following the rules. Also, good luck on trying to get someone to give up their window seat. In my experience everyone wants the window.", "NTA aren't the bathrooms closed during the seat belt fasten sign anyway?", "NTA. rules are rules", "NTA. You are not obligated to put yourself at risk for someone else.", "NAH like others have said if I was dude I woulda just climbed over you lol must not have been an emergency", "Not all disabilities are visible.

Some people react to fear by refusing to undo their seatbelt. Other people react to fear by having an accident in their pants. Think about it. Also, next time please make sure you get a window seat. Unless that would freak you out too...", "eh YTA. He had to use the restroom. I don't think he would've asked if it wasn't important. He was probably really uncomfortable, enough to ask. It's not like he was just going to go chat with somebody.\n\nYou only had to be unbuckled for less than a minute total. It just would've been the nice thing to do.", "Ok so this is my opinion as a flight attendant. It\u2019s not really your right to decide if it\u2019s safe for another passenger (that you don\u2019t know) to get up or not. Even us crew cannot legally force you to stay in your seat/deny someone bathroom use even if the sign is on. If someone chooses to disobey the sign then they are also accepting whatever consequences might come their way. Let the crew chastise him instead. I understand if you didn\u2019t feel comfortable taking your seatbelt off but you could\u2019ve shifted into the aisle so he could step around you.", "It really doesn\u2019t matter, if the seatbelt sign is on it\u2019s on. It\u2019s not a suggestion or a request, it\u2019s a rule. It applies the same way people don\u2019t get to ignore traffic lights and road rules just because they need to use the bathroom.", "I\u2019ve been pretty sure I was going to shit myself and not get up on the final descent of a flight before because the signs were on (I didn\u2019t luckily, but I was fully prepared for the possibility)", "Your willingness to brave turbulence to avoid an accident doesn\u2019t mean you can expect other people to take that risk.", "I was a frequent flyer from the mid-80s through 2015.  I flew well over a million miles, and had top status with three of the legacy airlines.  As an experienced flyer, I ALWAYS kept my seatbelt on, because I know that turbulence can be sudden, unpredictable and, occasionally dangerous.  I've seen people bounce off the ceiling, get hit by beverage carts, or get slammed by unsecured \"personal items.\"  You are also wrong.  The seatbelt sign on ascent and descent is turned on, not because the crew doesn't want \"unnecessary moving about the cabin,\" but because take off and landing are the most dangerous parts of a flight and what otherwise might have been a smooth flight may experience severe turbulence at lower altitudes.  I've experienced my share of sudden downdrafts and updrafts, and crabbed or bounced landings.  Only the pilot knows why the seatbelt sign is necessary.  Sometimes the pilot will announce the reason, sometimes the pilot will notify the flight attendants, and sometimes the pilot will simply turn on the sign.  You, as a passenger, even one who is a frequent flyer, has no idea unless there's a specific announcement.  Sure, there were plenty of times when I needed the lav badly on descent, but I always asked an FA before getting up.  If they told me, \"We can't allow you, but if you do go be careful,\"  I'd get up.  If they said, \"Better not -- it's going to get pretty rough,\" I didn't.  \n\n\nBTW, if you're a frequent flyer, you would know that descent from cruise takes a minimum of 20-30 minutes, even on a relatively short flight from a lower altitude, and that ascent to cruise, or even 10,000 feet (which is when the pilot normally turns off the seatbelt sign) is 10-15 minutes.  5 minutes?  What do you fly, rocket ships?", "OP refused because the seatbelts signs were on and there had been an announcement specifically telling everyone to sit the f down. Social contract does not apply in this case.", "Have you been on a flight? When the seatbelt sign is on, the lavatories aren\u2019t accessible and they definitely aren\u2019t accessible when landing. Why should the OP get up twice during turbulence just so that a FA can tell him to hold it?", "If the FAs say to stay in seats due to turbulence, I'm going to follow their safety instructions and stay in my seat.", "I'm on your side and don't know why you are getting downvoted. It's pretty obvious that sitting by the window means no one needs to pass you...but most people already have preferences in regards to that. Especially if you don't luke flying. I'm way more comfortable in the aisle seat....I've taken many long flights and don't think I've ever had someone try to pass me during the time the light is on. It's not like it's constant."]}
