My SIL was adopted as a young child. In the last few years, after watching a lot of Tik Toks and videos of people bashing adoption, she has decided that she is anti adoption, no matter the circumstances. Up until a few years ago, my SIL raved about her adoptive parents and said they gave her the best life.\n\nBACKSTORY- My brother is also adopted. My brother is really my cousin. My parents adopted him when he was around six because his mother was an addict and continued to put herself and him in very dangerous situations. Tonight, Abby and I were discussing mutual friends who had chosen to adopt a baby recently. Abby became very upset and said that adoption and fostering should be shut down because kids are better off with their birthparents, no matter the circumstances. I reminded her of my brother's situation. Abby argued that regardless of the drugs, my brother should have remained with his mom because being with your birthparent is better than being adopted, regardless of what dangerous activities parent might be involved in.\n\nI told her that I agree that getting the parent help should be the first priority, but sometimes it just doesn't work. She said I was a selfish bitch and so were my parents because we robbed my brother of time with his \"real\" mother and put him with a fake family. She said my parents should have given up everything to get his mom help and we obviously didn't try hard enough because they wanted to steal my brother.  She said I was trying to gaslight her with stories of pretend good adoptions and trying to change her experience.\n\nAt this point in time, I saw red. I lost it and told her that she was a word that starts with C and she had no clue what gaslighting meant. I told her that she was a terrible person to think that leaving a five year old in a home where addiction of the worst substances was rampant and other terrible situations for children occurred every day. I told her that she could take her experience and shove it up her condescending ass. My SIL stormed out and my BIL is angry and told my husband I should have just let her vent and not said anything. My husband asked me to apologize, but I told him that I only apologize if I am sorry, and I am not sorry worth a damn. My BIL and SIL are refusing to come to Christmas now and some of the family are unhappy about the situation and want me to apologize.\n\nI might be the asshole for arguing about adoption with my adopted SIL and potentially ruining Christmas.

Is she experiencing some type of PTSD from being adopted? You were defending your brother and she's wrong, most adoptions turn out good.  It sounds like not having a relationship with her own parents is what's upsetting her bc her birth parents gave her up (maybe didn't fight for her? IDK her circumstance). Either way I wouldn't apologize.", "NTA. I can absolutely say that your SIL is completely wrong about kids staying with bio parents regardless of what is going on. \n\nI\u2019m a social worker and I work with abused children. I\u2019ve personally had to remove shaken babies who have so much damage they will never be the same, children whose sibling was murdered by their parent, children who were sexually abused, the list goes on.  \n\nYes, many children can stay in the home with their parents while they get help for drug abuse or even domestic violence, as long as some safety parameters are in place.  But sometimes the risk is too great to allow a child to stay in the home even if the parent is getting help. \n\nWhen a child is removed from the home, the goal is almost always reunification. There are those cases so horrific that the child will never be allowed to return to the parents, but thankfully those are few and far between. Even when the parent is working hard to reunify, it\u2019s sometimes too unsafe for the child to be in the home until they\u2019ve made enough progress to increase safety.  \n\nI\u2019ve talked with people like your SIL, who feel kids should never be removed. They usually don\u2019t have any experience with trauma and cannot imagine what some of these children go through. I\u2019m glad for them, that they\u2019ve never experienced severe trauma, but they fail to understand that means they have no idea what a victim of abuse or neglect goes through.  When I give them examples of some of the horrific cases I\u2019ve worked, they blow it off like that only happens in movies. I ask where they think the ideas for those movies come from, but they just don\u2019t understand.", "NTA - I agree that helping the parent should be number 1 but as you said, it doesn't always work. Every situation is different so it's hard to say what the correct answer is. Considering she loved and raved about her adoptive parents up until now, it definitely sounds like she's jumped on the bandwagon from Tik Tok...\n\nAs for your brothers situation, I have personally worked with kids that were exposed to parents with alcohol and drug addiction from a very young age and were neglected. This puts a huge strain on their early development (the most important stage in development) and the trauma runs deep. Sadly, the children often present with behavioural and mental issues and can end up in the system which is a whole another round of trauma. In your bothers case, he is lucky to have family to take him in.", "NTA why is this SIL of yours 37 years old and getting all her opinions from TikTok, the annoying dancing teenager app? Childish.", "Ha! Your sil should have a chat with an adopted member of my family. He was abandoned as an infant. It took 6 months to clear a pathway to adoption - during which time he lived in an orphanage and with not held except as necessary for feeding and diaper changes - the rest of the time he was in a crib with zero stimulation.\n\nAs an adult, he discovered he was the result of an affair and both parties returned to their marriages and didn\u2019t want to have anything to do with the child they created.\n\nIn her zero adoption world, what should have become of him?\n\nBy the way, his mom did get pregnant a few months after adopting him. The state adoption agency tried to take him back after finding out she was pregnant - she fought tooth and nail to keep her son. He is far more her mini-me than her bio child in personality.", "NTA Where exactly does she thunk the orphans should live? I was adopted. Does she think I should have just been left in a basket on my parents' graves to die? She understands that adoption can b brutal, especially cross-cultural adoption. However, too many families are even more brutal. Her desire for children to be abused in their birth families is sick. She is not just misguided. She is cruel. You told the truth. Don't back down.", "NTA.  Your SIL is an effin' moron.  She ought to have to read through a selection of family services removal cases.  Not just neglect removals, but the physical and sexual abuse removals.  The horrific crap some people do to their children is just incomprehensible.  \nHopefully your SIL will get over her mommy abandonment issues, thank her wonderful adoptive parents, and maybe volunteer some place that helps foster kids.  \nOr maybe she'll expand her horizons to anti-vaccer stupidity.  Either way, you can be cordial but you do not owe an apology.  If SIL conditions her attendance at family events on you apologizing (which she will take as you saying you were wrong), then she can F right on off.", "NTA. She needed to be told about herself.", "NTA and I don\u2019t understand her viewpoint completely. What is someone doesn\u2019t WANT their child? Is she saying the bio parent should be forced to care for them even if they don\u2019t want them?", "NTA she used to \"rave\" about how great her adoptive parents were until she watched a lot of tik toks and videos. I'm sorry but you can't help your SIL, like the MAGA crowd she has fallen down the rabbit hole.  People don't realize how many cult sites there are on the internet, you only hear about the big ones like Quanon.", "You are NTA. Not even a little bit. How dare your SIL criticize your parent\u2019s decision about their family. She is a cretin no doubt.", "NTA. Does she think sexually abusive biological households are 'better' than adoptive parents?", "NTA\n\nAnyone who is anti-adoption is an idiot. Some people shouldn't be parents, and every child deserves a good home.\n\nMakes me wonder what she thinks orphans should do...", "NTA.\n\nI have absolutely nothing nice to say about your SIL.  None.   She basically thought your brother would be better off dead than in a safe and happy home.  She insulted you and your brother and your parents.\n\nHonestly?  Good riddance.  I would call her the same thing and have no problem not seeing her for Christmas.  Someone who did get a happy home from being adopted suddenly wishing for children to die just so they could be in horrific situations with their birth parents is...not a very nice person.  At all.  Who needs THAT over christmas?", "I'm always amazed at people who have NEVER been abused thinking that they know what it's like. Or a person who has NEVER gone hungry for more than 1 meal. Or the terror that a child feels hearing that angry voice when they never have. Or being a child and having to accept that you were going to die because your mom or dad or grandparent were going to kill you: literally kill you not just beat you badly. Or being a child and praying to God to let you die so that the physical and mental pain you're in would stop. Or feeling the anguish a young child who tries repeatedly to unalive yourself and doesn't succeed. \n\nYour SIL can go to hell with her \"opinions\". She doesn't know what she's talking about.", "She done fell down a TikTok rabbit hole and made other people\u2019s experiences her reality\u2026. She needs to leave social media alone and get some therapy\u2026. I personally wouldn\u2019t apologize cause she was offensive and letting her rant is harmful to you and your family\u2026. Especially your brother", "You're NTA. She is spewing some narrow minded and barely thought out views. She's totally against adoption and fostering? What if the natural parents die? Or go to prison? Should their children just be left to fend for themselves? Even if the situation is not that extreme, common sense dictates that some people should not be raising children.\n\nNot coming to Christmas is their decision. Not your fault and not your problem.", "So, I like watching videos about murderers on youtube. Every once in a while, there would be a case where the parents abused, tortured and killed their child. One that really stuck with me was about a young boy that was tortured so badly by his father and stepmother, his siblings could hear him screaming \"I'm gonna die\". After his body couldn't take it anymore and he died, his body was fed to pigs.\n\nYour sister should listen to a few of those, and then think again if she really believes that in every. single. case. the child should just be left with their parents. I mean, better dead than removed from their abusive parents and placed in the care of loving adoptive family, right??", "NTA. But she sure is...\n\nMay your holidays be SIL free...", "NTA \n\nBoth of you have strong opinions and different experiences. Personally, I think your SIL is simplifying a complex issue, and basing any opinion on ticktocks without extensive research is irresponsible.\n\nWhile some children could have remained with birth parents, some children were removed from birth parents over questionable circumstances, NO child should have to live in an unsafe environment just because their birth parent is there.\n\nI'm truly sorry that you are going through this. Your SIL is entitled to her opinion. That does not give her permission to attack your family. She wasn't a party to your brother's adoption. She doesn't know the details. She made general assumptions, based on her personal bias.\n\nWhile I have empathy for your in-laws for being stuck in the middle of an uncomfortable situation, no apology is warranted, nessacery or deserved.", "NTA. \n\nAdoption sucks in some cases, that\u2019s true, but it\u2019s not an absolute. I\u2019m so tired of people radicalizing EVERYTHING. This is why we can\u2019t get our head straight when it comes to politics either, nobody is willing to understand that not everything is black and white, there\u2019s a whole spectrum of gray out there too.\n\nETA: If she\u2019s that insufferable then I say good riddance for Christmas", "NTA. Your SIL needs to learn... adoption is not bad, why would something that gives kids new hopes? that, for some people, is the only option to have kids... nah op, your SIL is just being hypocrite here, she's adopted and her life have been better than some kids with their birthparents", "NTA Do not argue with people who refuse to see reason. It is a waste of time. You will not convince someone who wants to believe something ridiculous of anything. Like flat earthers. It doesn't matter what evidence is shown they refuse to acknowledge it.", "Tiktok is not a good place to get your information. It kind of sounds like she's been radicalized. \n\nIn an ideal world, sure, your aunt would have overcome her addiction and been able to be a mom, but as we've seen time and time again, even people with all the resources in the world can't beat their addictions. \n\nThe adoption experience is not a monolith. \n\nNTA", "Adoptee here- adoptees often have quite a bit of trauma from our adoptions, and it sounds like she\u2019s working through hers actively right now. Don\u2019t take what she said personally and give her space. NAH.", "Wow. Sounds like she has spent way to much time on the internet. I think you held off as long as you could. You were repeatedly pushed, she knew what she was doing. More than once.

(From someone who\u2019s not adopted but has watched a lot of tiktoks on it.) surprisingly the app isn\u2019t just for teens. It definitely gets that reputation because a lot of teens watch it and are going to have a certain algorithm. With mine, videos on adoption have shown up and the biggest issue seems to be that any adoption is traumatic no matter how good the family is. There is something that people lose when they\u2019re taken from their birth family and some (not all families) expect everything to be fine because they love this new child and then they may not give them the proper resources to heal or they may have a closed adoption and then that child isn\u2019t allowed to grow up and know more about themselves because the parents want them to be \u201ctheir kid\u201d and not someone else\u2019s. Another issue is BIPOC children being adopted by families who don\u2019t allow them opportunities to grow closer to people from their own culture and then they feel an even bigger identity disconnect. So while your SIL is right in that reunification should be the goal (a point you even acknowledged to her) and there should be more resources available for people who need the help and want to keep their children, sometimes people don\u2019t want their children. Sometimes they don\u2019t have parents anymore. Sometimes it\u2019s a situation like your brother\u2019s where the child is in danger. All of those mean that a child needs somewhere to go. Adoption at the core is not a bad thing. It\u2019s the families not truly being prepared to raise a child with opportunities to know more about themselves that\u2019s the issue imo. I wouldn\u2019t say you ruined Christmas. Sometimes when people are spouting bs, you gotta call them out on it.", "NTA\n\nAbby sure is though. And as an abuse victim whose abuser was a parent? She can just fuck right off with that. I\u2019d have given anything to be free of my abuser. Abuse is not better than foster or adoption FFS.", "ESH I agree that you should have shut up and let her rant. You knew she was unbalanced on this issue. But she should not have ranted either.", "YTA\n\nAdoption is trauma. That is just a fact. You are not an adoptee and you don\u2019t get a vote.", "NTA. \n\nAfter reading your comments it sounds like you SIL is struggling with being \"rejected\" by her bio mom. Especially given her statement that no parent would ever willingly give up their child and that the government coerces the bio parents. \n\nI get it. That sort of rejection can be hard to come to terms with. \n\nAs someone who should have been removed by CPS her statements really sting, but I'm pretty sure she's just grappling with her bio mom surrendering her as a baby.", "Up until a few years ago, she raved about the childhood her parents provided for her. Her parents are very loving and continue to support her and her feelings about adoption.", "My parents paid for my aunt to go to rehab 3 times, numerous counselors, and even bought her a small house and put it on their property. That\u2019s just the money I know they spent. I feel like I can wholeheartedly say they tried to help her.", "IDK she is kind of addicted to it. She in constantly on her phone even when we have get together.", "She thinks no one would ever not want their child. The government is the problem because it doesn\u2019t offer enough support for those who have a baby and don\u2019t think they can care for it. I agree with her that there should be more counseling and parenting classes available and maybe other programs to help, but some people just do not want kids. And no one should grow up in a home where they are not wanted.", "She kind of just ignores those types of situations when she\u2019s preaching about this.", "My in laws are very understanding of both of our sides on this issue. But they have said whomever chooses not to come to Christmas is making their own choice. They will not choose one person to attend over the other nor will they ask anyone to apologize in order to attend. I\u2019m fine with her coming to Christmas without apologizing. Like I said, I only apologize if I\u2019m sorry. I know she\u2019s not sorry so an apology is pointless. I have no intention of continuing this argument with her, especially at Christmas.", "My SIL asked if I had heard about the couple bringing home their baby from the hospital. Except she referred to it as kidnapping.", "I completely agree with what you\u2019ve said. We fawned over my brother, still do actually lol. We all think he\u2019s amazing and the best thing to happen to our family. I\u2019m 11 years older than him so we had a special bond. I was past the point of needing my parents attention, and we basically all turned our attention to him. Even with all of that, he\u2019s not without his demons. He couldn\u2019t hug any of us until he lived with us for almost a year. He physically didn\u2019t even know how and he didn\u2019t like to be touched. We let him make his own choices and one day out of nowhere, he jumped on me and hugged me so tight. My mom started crying. But he has battled addiction and other issues due to his trauma.", "Yes I know her views on it. She also knows mine. I would never bring it up to her, but I\u2019m also not going to stand there and listen to someone spout beliefs that are ridiculous and contradict everything I believe because they want to try and convince me my family stole my brother. If that makes me suck, I\u2019m ok with that. I\u2019ll be the asshole.", "Maybe she shouldn't have outright attacked OP and suggest that OP's brother was better off in a dangerous situation with an mother that was neglecting him.  I mean; the SIL struck first and viciously.", "This doesn\u2019t make sense.", "I'm with OP, this doesn't make any sense.\n\nSo do you think that children should be left with their abusers?  Even if that means neglect?\n\nLike what's the solution there?", "No i'm wondering if she tried to find her bio parents and they rejected her. So maybe she feels that if she wasn't adopted she would have a relationship with her? Who knows. smh.

I've met my bio mom, and we are friends now, absolutely the right thing happened. \n\nSomeone is spoon feeding her this crap, and she is lapping it up. That her parents still support her, with this kind of attitude, shows what good parents they are, It's sad because she is telling them there is something wrong with their love.\n\nI would have trouble being around someone with such a toxic attitude.", "It does make sense.

If you aren\u2019t an adoptee, you can\u2019t understand.", "Of course, I don\u2019t think children should be left with abusers. I am just saying that for the child, adoption is trauma. Is a nice home less traumatic than being raised in a crack house. Of course it is. But even the most ideal adoption is traumatic for the child.", "She met her birth mom. Birthmom had no vices, she was just very young and was not ready to parent on her own. They have a good relationship but I think SIL is jealous because her birthmom had more kids 15 years later.", "I do not know what this means.", "Imagine saying the Turpin children should be forced to stay with their parents!", "She actually is a very good person, but tends to be argumentative. I actually really like her and enjoyed her company before she started pushing her opinions on others. This is not the only opinion she has been aggressive about. It\u2019s just the only one that was personal to me.", "It doesn\u2019t make sense because I do get a vote. I do get to have an opinion about something that absolutely has been a huge part of my family. Just because she\u2019s an adoptee doesn\u2019t mean she is automatically right. I can respect her having her beliefs without thinking she is right just like she can respect my beliefs. But to say I don\u2019t get a vote is ridiculous.", "There is also severe trauma in being in a household with abuse and neglect. For the SIL to argue that the trauma of being cared for in a safe and loving home is equivalent or worse than the physical/emotional/sexual abuse-related trauma of being in an unsafe household is beyond irrational and a sign that she needs serious counseling. Her \u201cideal childhood\u201d has left her widely out of touch with the reality of the households from which many fosters/adoptees are removed.", ">you can\u2019t understand.\n\nOh come on.\n\nSeriously?!  SIL attacked OP's family.  SIL does not get to weaponize her experience and use it a shield to malicious attack and insult others.  That's wrong.", "So OP should've let SIL attack her family for adopting her cousin from a dangerous situation?  OP should be called selfish, and her family be called a 'fake family' because they adopted?  Cause that's why OP snapped.  SIL's behavior was not okay and OP did not deserve that.", "But no one said that it wasn\u2019t. I agree that she definitely has trauma and I try to be mindful of that. But that doesn\u2019t give her the right to say whatever she wants.", "Nta. She does sound like she may be jealous and have built up a bit of resentment. Therapy would probably help.\nI am alive today because I grew up in foster care. My dad was extremely abusive and almost killed me. Unfortunately when they had my parents go through everything they needed to get me back it didn't work out and I was at a age no one wanted to adopt me and the family that did they wouldn't let them adopt me because of \"conflict\". I aged out but I'm alive and have a better life than if I would have stayed with my parents.

They even helped me get my driver's license.", "That must really hurt", "You\u2019re mad at the way she feels about her own adoption.
