Due to privacy policies we did not give out or discuss patron information with just anyone, which really upset these helicopter parents because it forced their kid to take responsibility for their own messes. My boss had no problem telling them this, but got awfully tired of having to do it at all because she shouldn't have to be explaining why Johnny or Susie need to figure out how to care of their own problems.
