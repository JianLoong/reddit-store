I\u2019d say abusive but out of touch with anything resembling reality is more like it. Get thee to your preferred school far far away from them and your shiftless brother. And congratulations on being accepted to the schools you want to attend! Good job. NTA", "Don't set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm.\n\nNTA it is not your job as a sibling to make sure your brother is ok. Don't put your future in jeopardy because your parents want to saddle you with your brother.", "NTA. It\u2019s their job to guide your brother, not yours.", "NTA. Your parents are for not setting boundaries with your brother, and expecting you to cater to him as well. He's an adult. They need to let him do his own thing, or not, and fail. But they shouldn't stop YOU from realizing your dreams and wants.", "NTA.  Your brother can go to a community college for a couple of years. Or he could go into trades and have hands-on training, which might be better suited to his learning style.", "NTA. Do you. Do not let anybody hold you back", "NTA\nYou are Johns BROTHER not his PARENT and you shouldn't be treated as such. Your parents failed in their responsibilities to raise him to be a functioning adult. This is not your problem. Go live yoir own life OP.", "John is their son, not yours. It's not up to you to take him by the hand and walk him through life. Go where you need to go for your degree. NTA", "NTA If you are covering all education expenses on this matter, your parents don\u2019t really have a say. You\u2019ll definitely strain your relationship, but a healthy boundary needs to be established with something like this. Being a guide for your older brother in college sounds horrible", "NTA - Although your lack of paragraphs is vexing. Absolutely do not compromise on your life and future on the basis that... your brother is a bit lazy and doesn't know what to do with himself?\n\nIf anything with what your parents are saying you probably should move away so you aren't expected to be his life coach.", "Nta. You have to live your own life. Honestly by \u2018guiding\u2019 john it will probably just enable his behaviour. He needs to take it upon himself to do better and he won\u2019t do that while everyone\u2019s accommodating all his needs.", "Nta. It's not your job to *guide* your siblings through life. Your parents are supposed to do that...go to your dream school, get your dream career and do you. If your brother chooses to not care then that's on him. He is an adult who needs to get his crap together.", "NTA. \n\nYour parents' selfishness by proxy is astounding.\n\nLive your own life and reach for your own goals! You didn't grow up to be a babysitter.", "NTA. I'm baffled at your parents' insistence that John go to college. He's clearly going to fail out in the first year. College isn't the path for everyone.\n\nYou do what's best for you. You are not your brother's keeper and he is not your responsibility.", "\u201cMom and dad, I am NOT my brother\u2019s keeper. It is not my fault he chooses to play video games all day. In fact, I would lay the blame at your feet. I am driven and want the best education I can get. This does not include being responsible for my older brother who can\u2019t get his crap together. If you want a babysitter for him, hire someone.\u201d\n\nNTA.", "NTA it's not your job to help him get through life. Dude needs to learn responsibility.", "\"don't care about John's life,\" and what about yours? Did they forget that your their responsibility and child? They only care about John's life. Go to your dream school you are not selfish for wanting to live your life and not wanting to give up your dreams for John's poor decisions. NTA.", "NTA whatsoever. You are not responsible for your brother. You are not his parent. I think it's a shame that your parents are burdening you with that responsibility. You have obviously worked hard to get into your dream schools. I think your parents are the AH's here. Enabling your brother to continue to be indifferent and forcing you to give up your dreams to be his guide is complete BS. Kudos to you for not allowing them to do so. Really... it takes guts to fight the manipulation and guilt tactics parents can dish out. I wasn't as strong as you and still feel regret about not making my own decisions when I graduated high school, and that was 20 years ago. Please hold strong and go to the school of your choice. They no longer have the right to dictate what you do. You are not your brothers keeper, and sacrificing your dreams only hurts you. Get the hell out of that toxic house, and don't look back. Hopefully, your parents will get their heads out of their asses and let their kids choose their own path.", "NTA. Shame on your parents for making your older brother your responsibility!", "Jumping on this top comment to advise OP that he contact his chosen school and set up a password so his parents can\u2019t unenroll him without his knowledge.", " You are not responsible for your brother. You need to do what\u2019s best for you.", "The parents are failing both kids here. Well done to OP for putting a stop to it.\n\nAs well as the horrible effects on OP of playing second fiddle to their brother all their life, they are setting John up to fail by not holding him accountable and trying to force him to spend years if his life on university he doesn't want. \n\nIf John doesn't want further education there is nothing wrong with that. There is nothing wrong with learning a trade or earning an honest wage in a shop or office etc. The problem is as you said, that the parents aren't teaching John to care.", "I was thinking, \"I bet John is the golden child, and OP is the scapegoat.\"", "[deleted]", "NTA - You are not responsible for your brother.", "Yeah, that's the pertinent more info item.\n\nI think OP is good, because he didn't lie.  I'm assuming he knows it means he's on his own.  Doubt they'll give him any help.  Sounds like he's suggesting that he has it worked out in spite of his youth.\n\nThis isn't a money issue, by the way.  It's that parents expect him to stick around so that big bro isn't going to higher education alone.  Where does that end?  Is he expected to get hired in the same place as his brother so that brother can run to him whenever he needs help?  That's not going to fly.", "Not really seeing the relevance here, there\u2019s no indication OP is a Christian. Not everyone is a Christian or lives by those values. NTA", "Brother isn\u2019t disabled. Instead he is being treated like a baby.  Ask any 19/20 if they were able to not pay bills, not get a job, and play video games all day or go to school and have to study - they would say yes to video games. The parents have a failure to launch child bc they aren\u2019t demanding their adult son to take any responsibility for his life. OP is NTA", "It took me so long to figure out CBF last time I saw it was in a bad mil group where it meant 'cats butt face'", "Also, make sure your parents can\u2019t empty out any savings you have as an attempt to hobble you.", "Um, ask and 19 to 90. \nHell, I\u2019d say yes to that."]}
