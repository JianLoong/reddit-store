They lived in my hometown(I live in a diffrent city 2-3 hours way), my other brother G and sister still live there. George wants to live in my dead brother's house.\n\nI(29F) go to my hometown at least once a month to see some friends and niblings. 7 years ago my parents downsize, they got a cottege with 2 bedrooms, I stayed there for my monthly visit twice and it was awful, so Mason and SIL offered me their couch and I accepted. They were living in a 2 BR aparment with 2 little kids and saving for a house.\n\n2 years later Mason and SIL approached me for help and told me their idea. They wanted to buy a 4 BR house, the kids were growing up, the issue was that even with their savings it was nowhere near enough for the downpayment they needed for the mortgage to be approved since only my brother was signing on it because SIL had a debt problem that her parents created without her knowledge and she didn't want to report them. So they asked if I was willing to co-sign it, I woudn't have to pay anything, I would be on the deed until they pay it off and I could use the 4th BR when I visit. I said yes.\n\nHalf of the house is mine, and the other half is my niece and nephew's(8 and 11), I'm gonna keep paying the mortgage, It's for them. They are staying with a friend at the moment, but they will be moving in with me in the near future since neither or my siblings wanted to take care of them.\n\nNow, a few hours ago George called me, conversation:\n\nGeorge: What's going to happen with the house?. \n\nMe: Nothing, I'll keep paying for it, it's for niblings.\n\nGeorge: It's just an empty house, me and family should move in, so we can sell our house and help our savings.\n\nMe: No, we are going to use the house, where are we going to stay when we go for a visit?.\n\nGeorge: The basement is huge, we'll get some beds and it'll be fine.\n\nMe: Stop, I'm tired of you guys bullying me and taking advantege of me, when are you going to give me back the money I lend you for your current house?.\n\nGeorge: Oh don't be a AH, you know money is tight, not all of us can be Elon Musks.\n\nMe: You can do what you want, sell your house, but you're not gonna live in Mason's house.\n\nGeorge: Stop being such an AH, think of your niblings.\n\nMe: I am, the ones that are in my care, and that's a house for them to live in, not for you.\n\nAnd then I hung up on him, I was with a friend when he called and she said I was harsh with him, and now I feel a bit guilty about it, I know the money would beneficial for them.

If you are only using it for visits, that rent money could be put into savings / investment account for your nibbling that are in your care. Give them a nice nest egg for college or a future investment or whatever. Basically another way of mom and dad giving back to their children when they are no longer physically there.\n\nIt would solve the problem with your AH brother wanting to move in there.", "NTA\n\nProtect that house. Cameras, security, change the locks, whatever you need.\n\nSorry for your loss. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re there for your niblings.", "NTA. It's an asset for your orphaned neice and nephew. I'd consider renting it out to generate passive income for their futures. But you are stepping up for them and your brother seems to see the death as an opportunity to cash in and benefit. Maybe if he'd offered to pay rent, it might be worth talking.", "NTA\n\nIts sounds like Brother is looking for a free  place to live.  If they owe you money, even more reason to know they just want to mooch off of you.\n\nYou could be petty and offer them the basement.  If they accepted.  Make sure they can never access the main house.", "I think you're going to need security cameras at the house. You should also change all of the locks. Who knows how many keys are out there with the current locks. I'm worried that George would move in and then you would have to go through the eviction process to get rid of him.\n\n\nYou are absolutely NTA. Your original deal with Mason and your SIL was generous and thoughtful. And now, you are doing everything in your power to support your niece and nephews. \n\n\nGeorge is out of line. He's trying to financially gain from Mason's death. It's disgusting.", "NTA.\n\nIf you let them live in your and your niblings\u2019 house, you will never be able to regain possession. They will always have an excuse as to why they can\u2019t possibly move out. George wants to sell his current house, so when the time comes when you or your niblings want to move in or sell, it\u2019s a safe bet that George will be whining about how house prices have gone up and he can\u2019t afford anywhere that meets his standards, how he\u2019s too old to get a mortgage, how he wants to retire and any savings he has built up are earmarked for that, etc.", "Nta but your other brother may try to move in without your consent I would make sure that the place is locked dow", "NTA.\n\nI would have been more blunt with George.\n\n\"Pay me back what you owe me, and I'll consider letting you rent Mason's house. I won't even consider it until you finish paying me back. There's no chance of you ever living there rent free. Niece and nephew own half the house, and they have no reason to let you live there rent free after the way you've treated them.\"", "That's a good idea, thanks", "Oh that's another issue in itself, i'm taking the kids because even though i offered in to financially help whoever takes them, neither of my siblings wanted to.\n\nThey basically said that since i'm well off, have a well paying job and my partner also has a well paying job we should take them. They are with a friend until I get a place with enough space for them. \n\nBut I can afford the house, I don't really need to rent it out, but I'm thinking about turning it into an AirBnB or something foe when we are not there since itvs near the beach.", "When I had the conversation with my niblings about coming with me, they didn't want to loose the house, i know they are kids but they are attached to it, and honestly so am i.\n\nI'm thinking about maybe turn it into an AirBnB or something for when we are not there, it's a coast town, the beach it's not far.", "Yeah, that's the plan", "I'm tired of them both, him and my sister, they always walked all over me and I let them.\n\nBut I won't let them have something that is for my niblings, especially after how they treated them since their parents died.\n\nIf they keep going in the offensive, so am I.", "Thank you, I will look into the letter.", "Honestly, knowing him, I don't think he plans to pay rent or anything if I let him move in.", "Yes, i'm thinking about turning it into an AirBnB or something, the beach is just a few blocks away, all the money would be for niblings, I don't need it.", "Thank you", "I don't think he would want to pay rent, this is the man who asked my for money as a loan multiple times and I have never seen a cent", "Oh yeah, he loves free stuff from me.", "Not just that if your brother who passed may have left a spare key w a neighbor, friend, or relative you may want to get those keys back. Your other brother sounds very determined to live there so he may use illegal means to accomplish that.\n\nYou may also want to touch base w neighbors who are nearby and give them a heads up NO ONE but you should be at the house and to pls contact you & the police if they see anyone there.\n\nIt is alot easier to keep people out\nThan to\nGet rid of them once they move in.\nSquatters have more rights than  property owers.", "Also lose the ' friend' NTA", "I thought of that as well...renting it out for vacationers or traveling nurses (stuff like that). And forgot to say, sorry for your loss. Tragic...I lost my dad tragically at a very young age.", "No reason to take any drastic measures at this point since everyone must really be in psychological shock and trauma - especially the kids who lost both parents.\n\nTurning it into an economic asset makes sense. If it is a tourist place, you could hire a professional person to take care of all the administrative stuff.", "Good, then that is no option. And you should not let them live there.", "Great idea as well, so you can still \u201cbook\u201d it when you need it. \n\nHaving a rental management company run things for you would also provide some good security for it things are off.\n\nThere is a fun series on Netflix called \u201cStay Here\u201d about running a successful short term rental. It was filmed in 2018ish I think, so pre COVID, but still fairly relevant.", "Then ask him why his orphaned neice and nephew should be supporting him.", "i didn't think of that, ugh now i have to talk to the neighbors, i wish my family would give me a break", "Agree, OP should get the locks changed", "Thank you, I just want my niblings to be okay, and I'm so dumb sometimes, i never thought me and my brother were real friends just friendly, he was 10 years older then me, and there were some issues when I was a kid regarding all my siblings, and then he apologized and we moved on, but recently i had the realization that we have been friends for a long time and it just took his death for me to see it.", "Yeah, I don't need the money, I can afford the house without renting it. But if i do rent it, it won't be soon.", "Thank you, I'll look it up.", "Because Toreto once said \"FAMILY\".", "Going home if possible may be a good idea. Guaranteethey are already moving in.", "Just change all the locks - much easier and fool proof.  Install cameras and an alarm system.  With the house vacant for periods of time, an alarm service it worth it.  \nAnd casually mention to family members that you will be proceeding with charges if there are any trespassers on your property.  \nYou are protecting it for your niblings.  \nNTA", "I am so sorry. And deepest condolences.", "Think of it as money for the niblings", "Unfortunately I have a plane to catch tomorrow morning for work, but i will call a friend there and see if she and/or her boyfriend can stay in the house until I return.", "Yeah, for their college fund or something, they have a combined one, I plan on opening a new one and put the same amount the old one currently has so each have their own.", "Please update if you find out you\u2019ve got squatters.", "This is probably the best idea until you can get a security system with cameras. \n\nBest of luck. It sounds as though your neice and nephew are lucky to have you.", "Will do, but I hope I won't need to.", "NTA \n\nDon\u2019t let your friend tell you that, she can buy George a house or keep her mouth shut.", "op=NTA\n\nGeorge sounds greedy and you'd never get them OUT when the time comes.\n\nAre you going to rent out the house for them so that you can build money for them?", "This is where you go to a real estate agent and put it up for rent, have the rent payments go directly to the mortgage to pay it down faster. \n\nLet the real estate manage everything so if your brother rents it, he has no choice but to fork out the cash.", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAs the one in my family everyone takes advantage of...stick to your guns on this. Do what is right for the niblings in your care", "NTA", " NTA You were harsh because he doesn\u2019t listen!", "NTA, it's your and your niblings' house, you don't have to justify not sharing it with anyone. Let alone your parasite brother.\n\nEveryone else has already given good recommendations for security against your brother breaking in and setting up shop, but do keep in mind that your brother is not the only potential squatter you could end up with. I don't know where you are in the world, but in my country there's a severe housing crisis, and many people are getting desperate and willing to do things that ordinarily they'd feel to be bad or wrong. I'd strongly recommend you find a caretaker for the property soonish, just for that.", "NTA.  Kudos to you for keeping your priorities straight!  Caring for your niblings and planning for their future is paramount!\n\nI also believe you were absolutely correct in being very direct (blunt) in telling George NO in absolutely unmistakable terms. If people want to hear a thing, like \"yes\", then they will hear it if you say anything other than very blatantly NO. \n\nI agree with the earlier comments about security cameras etc.  How long do you expect to keep the house \"in holding\" for the niblings?  Maybe you could find a renter for that time frame?  Just a thought.\n\nYou're doing a terrific job.", "NTA! Don\u2019t let them take advantage of you.

I don't really need the money.", "Yeah, I'm working on that", "What is wrong with your friend?\n\nYou are sticking up for literal ORPHANS from being taken advantage of by their greedy uncle...and your friend is concerned about you \"sounding harsh\"?", "Hence the use a real estate as your middle man, even with the air bnb that way it's hands off.", "Hijacking the top post to say, lots of homeowners insurance policies won't cover an empty house for more than a fixed number of days.  Check Mason's policy; you may not be able to afford leaving the house completely empty.\n\nThis is NOT a reason to let your other brother squat.  ~~It may be a reason to sell the house, unfortunately.~~  Be aware that being a long-distance AirB&B renter can be a problem, because you aren't able to check after each guest and you'll have to pay for even the smallest of repairs/replacements of damaged items.", "change the locks and put in cameras.", "Safer to change the locks and get a home camera.\n\nalso.
