He also suffers from a head injury that causes him to be unable to perform some tasks properly as well as constant confusion. Sometiimes he'd lose track of time.\n\n\nI take care of the house and kids on me own. Yesterday, I wanted to go shopping for some christmas stuff but couldn't take the kids because firstly, they'd want to get everything they see. And secondly, I didn't want them to see what I bought them. I couldn't get the babysitter to come watch the kids like she does usually when I'm out. I was in a rush, what I did was place the kids ( 3&5 )and their toys near my husband and asked him to just keep an eye on them. He was unsure of the whole thing but I had to leave.\n\n\nDuring my 2nd hour of shopping I got an angry call ftom his mother berating me for leaving my husband with the kids knowing he's unable to watch them properly. I went home and she yelled at me there saying thank God she came over because she found my husband asleep in his wheelchair and the kids were out of sight. I said I was in a rush, the babysitter didn't come and thought it wouldn't hurt if he watched them for a couple of hours. She argued about how irresponsible I was to leave my husband with the kids knowing he's unable to watch them like any other able bodied person could. She said I should've made sure someone was with the kids and my husband. I had a screaming match with her and my husband just watched. She left and told her family about what a horrible mother I was and even claimed I was abusing my husband by giving him tasks he can not handle. They of course sided with her.\n\n\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1667478531, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yl1jta/aita_for_leaving_the_kids_with_my_husband_for_2/", "score": 1709, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

But OP, are you okay? Do you have enough support between your husband and kids? Maybe reach out to the extended family next time if you need a couple hours by yourself. You\u2019re in a major caregiver position and need to take care of yourself, but please don\u2019t forget your kids are also babies. I doubt they could have called 911 or family members for help if they needed it. Wait until they are older to do this again.", "YTA. I'm going to soften this a little bit because I'm sure this is all very hard for you. You have two young children that it sounds like you are essentially raising as a single mother.\n\nYou *know* your husband can't look after the kids. You *know* it's not safe to leave them with someone who loses time and gets confused. You *know* you need a babysitter when you go out. You *know* that you should not have gone out yesterday and that you *wanted* to go shopping, but you didn't *have* to yesterday. *You know your MIL is right that you essentially left the kids alone, unsupervised and you're lucky she turned up*.\n\nBut you did it anyway. This is a sign that you aren't coping. You need help. You need to find resources that make things easier for you. You need to reach out for more help. Ask your MIL if she's able to help more so you have someone other than the babysitter to call on. Ask your own family. Do *something* before this entire thing eats you alive.", "I'm going to try and give judgement fairly but with sympathy.\n\nI can't imagine how difficult things must be for you right now. But OP, you were extremely irresponsible and definitely YTA for what you did. Your husband cannot take care of your children under the current circumstances, that's the unfortunate reality. And you leaving the kids to him could have ended terribly. Anything could have happened and your husband would have been unable to do anything to help/protect your kids or himself. You might as well have left the kids alone. It would have been essentially the same.\n\nChristmas shopping isn't a priority, there's still nearly two months left. You could have asked someone else to keep an eye on the kids, or you could have gone any other day when your babysitter is available. \n\nBut I'm genuinely not trying to shame you. I think you went now despite it being a terrible idea because you are overwhelmed and you needed an excuse to be out for some hours without feeling terrible for being overwhelmed. You are taking care of two very young kids and a husband that can't take care of himself, and you are over your limit. You need help, someone that can come by and help with your husband. There's nothing shameful about it; there's a reason why people have a job on that field. \n\nTaking care of someone disabled is incredibly difficult, and requires professional assistance. There's a lot of stigma about asking for professional help, but it's utter nonsense and you owe it to yourself, your kids and your husband to find a way to move forward. And it clearly cannot be the same way it's been until now, because it's not working. Your lack of judgement could very well be due to the stress. And that means it's time to find solutions that keep all your family (you, husband and kids) safe, healthy and happy.\n\nSo yeah, I have to say YTA. But please op, take it as a wake up call to ask for help. I am not here to shame you, I'm here to say there are resources, and you should make use of them. This kind of stuff cannot happen again.", "YTA and I strongly suspect this isn\u2019t exactly about the Christmas shopping. You\u2019ve been experiencing a stressful situation that is likely to cause anyone to burn out. Needing a break to get out of the house alone is reasonable. Leaving your children without adequate care is not. Your reaction to others rightly being upset about the children being endangered is not. You clearly need help dealing with the home situation now that your husband needs more care and can\u2019t equally participate in child care. You\u2019re in a hard situation no one would envy, but at the end of the day you are responsible for ensuring those kids are not endangered. Being left with someone who can\u2019t care for them and keep them safe is endangering them. It sounds like MIL is close enough to come over so next time you  NEED to get out, why not just call her if the baby sitter isn\u2019t free? I also encourage you to look into respite care to help give yourself a break from time to time.", "What you are describing here and the way to tell it makes me thinks that you are on the verge of a caretaker burn out. Of course it was bad to leave your very YOUNG children under the care of your physically and mentally impaired husband. Dangerous for all actually.\n\nBUT I'm not sure why despite what you wrote you did not come to that realization yourself which in turn makes me thinks you are not in a decent state of mind, be it exhaustion, grieving (for what life was supposed to be) or something along those lines.\n\nTry and reach for all the help you can and good luck for everything.\n\nAnd YTA for this situation but you know it I think.", "YTA I\u2019m sorry this is a difficult situation but you were wrong to leave such young children in the care of someone who is clearly not mentally fit to even care for themselves let along children.\n\nYour mother in law was right to be upset with you. Clearly you need more support or some kind of help with this situation.", "YTA Anything could happen to two small unsupervised children. He\u2019s clearly not in the right frame of mind to care for them. Why would you risk it?", "My father died of cancer and I saw my mom almost run herself into the ground in trying to care for him. Fortunately she had help (Hospice Care was GREAT!) and she could get some rest and time away.\n\nI know that people don't talk about this, but caregiver burnout is a very real thing and it sounds as if maybe you have it.  You're NOT a bad person because of this.  However, you have to get help.  Putting your children in the care of someone who physically CAN'T care for them is dangerous (at best!).\n\nYTA - in regards to this situation.  You are N-T-A for having caregiver burnout.\n\nBTW - I agree with your MiL that it was (borderline) abuse to put your husband and children in that situation.\n\nSo please seek help - for yourself, your husband and your children.  Don't EVER put your husband and children in that situation again.", "YTA shop online, wait a couple days it's the start of Nov, ask your mil. All better solutions then leaving your very young children essentially home alone. You are very irresponsible and whatever your real rush was put your children in serious danger.", "YTA for leaving the kids with your husband knowing he couldn\u2019t do it. But are you getting any help at all? This is a lot to handle in this situation", "YTA BUT I think you might have caretaker burnout. It is a very real thing and can result in making decisions that you normally would never make. You\u2019re a good mom, you\u2019re doing the best you can. Have a 5 and 3 year old is hard enough, but add having to take care of an injured adult plus all the responsibilities that come with taking care of the home, holidays etc. Will these injuries heal? Will he be able to pull his own weight eventually? If not it\u2019s time to start coming up with a long term plan. I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re in this position. Do t forget to take care of yourself too! Without you everything will completely fall apart.", "YTA. I'm sorry you're in this situation, but your husband is not capable of being a partner to you in this way. It's not safe to leave your children with a person - even if that person is their parent - who is not physically capable of caring for children.", "YTA. I appreciate that you are probably overwhelmed and need some alone time, but your husband is not able to safely look after children of that age on his own.", "INFO: You mention several times you were in a rush, but i don't understand WHY. Why was their a rush to do the shopping right then?", "\"*They of course sided with her.\"*\n\nYou mean because she was right? This is one of those rare MIL stories where she was 100% right.\n\nYou basically left your kids uncared for.\n\nIf you don't want to be your husband's caregiver then you need to just get out of the marriage.\n\nYTA.", "YTA\n\nYou're clearly overwhelmed but that is no excuse to abandon your children. They really had no supervision as you admit your husband has lapses in memory and isn't physically capable of intervening in an emergency or crisis.  \n\nYou need to ask for help.  As much for the sake of your children, as your own sanity.  You are stretched too thin but you had a serious lapse in judgement here.  The christmas shopping could be done at any time.  \n\nReach out to family and friends and check your local resources for in home help and respite.  You need to do the leg work and get help.  You are only one person, trying to do too many things i.e. being a mother to 2 young children, run a home and look after an adult with spinal cord injuries.  You need help and that's ok...  but don't just leave your kids virtually unattended because you needed a time out (and that's what that supposed christmas shopping emergency really was).", "YTA.  He has constant confusion.  Your children are 3 & 5.  Part of having someone watch over your children is having someone able to attend to the kids (and it sounds like your husband would need attention too).  It sounds like you had options too such as your MIL.  Instead you plunked them down with toys and went for 2 hours.  It must be difficult to be in your situation but your judgment in this case was very off.", "YTA..I was raised by a severely disabled father, however his disabilities didn't prevent him from caring for us. Your husband's disabilities do. This was a massive error in judgement. You need to find out what more help you could get and maybe grovel to his family and explain that you need more.support to stop this kind of thing from happening again.", "YTA You put your kids in a dangerous situation for no good reason. You know he has limitations on what he can do and decided the risk was worth it. Your Mother is right. Your own description of your husbands condition precludes him from being able to be responsible for small kids. \n\nChristmas is almost two months away, you could have waited until there was someone else to watch the children. You need to consider if there was an emergency could your husband handle it? In a fire could he get them out? There are a lot of bad things that can happen, and kids in that age range are hard to manage sometimes. YTA", "Unfortunately, YTA. Christmas shopping at the beginning of November is *so important* that you couldn\u2019t have waited until you found someone to look after the kids? If your husband can\u2019t take care of himself, how can he take care of your kids? \n\nI agree with MIL, and if she was over there to help your husband when he called, maybe you could have called her in the first place to come babysit? Then she wouldn\u2019t be angry with you for this neglect and abuse? \n\nYTA. Christmas shop online or find a babysitter.", "So knowing that your husband is unable to even take care of himself properly, you left a 3 year old and a 5 year old in his care? For an \"emergency\" Christmas shopping? You have two whole months to do this. YTA. Something could have happened to your children.", "YTA, why would you leave your 2 children with someone who is incapable to doing basic care tasks for them?", "YTA. I get you are in a very difficult situation and your lives have all changed, but this wasn\u2019t on. You know he has issues with confusion and plainly, would struggle if one of the kids got themselves into a difficult position. It wasn\u2019t fair on any of them to just leave like that.  \n\nYou need to start asking for more help.  You wanted to go shopping. You couldn\u2019t get the babysitter. That should either trigger you asking elsewhere, or simply putting off your plans. \n\nYour mother in law was correct. Not saying she handled it perfectly but she was likely in a panic about her son and grandchildren being in danger.", "YTA\u2026 there is no such thing as a shopping emergency that justifies leaving your children in a dangerous situation. Which is exactly what you did. \n\nI\u2019m absolutely sure you\u2019re pretty exhausted from the situation with your husband, taking care of him and two children. But when you feel burnt out and need a break you ask for help, you be honest and say you have to have a break. Clearly your MIL had time to come over and watch them and you didn\u2019t even ask her\u2026 don\u2019t let your exhaustion and stress decrease the level of care for your children and husband.", "YTA.

You can't leave young children with someone in that condition. It's incredible dangerous. If I was your mil I would have immediately called CPS on you. Seriously what the hell", "I mean, yes, you are. If there had been an emergency of some sort, your husband would not have been able to help the kids and vice versa. Christmas shopping is not an emergency situation that needed to be done right at that minute. Why didn\u2019t you ask your MIL to watch them when you couldn\u2019t get the sitter to come over? I understand your current situation is difficult with your husband\u2019s condition, but you put everyone in a potentially dangerous situation; it\u2019s not like you left them alone for 10 minutes to shower.", "The circumstances you are in seem to have made it really difficult for you to see wants versus needs. The reality is that a Christmas shopping trip at the beginning of November is a want. Having someone in the house who is able bodied and capable, and can ensure everyone is safe is a need. Your life is creating compassion fatigue, which affects judgement and reasoning. You need help. More than a babysitter. The load you\u2019ve taken on is too great, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be an end in sight. So, while the family that piled on is correct when they say that situation you created is dangerous and YTA for putting your family in danger, it\u2019s time for them to step up and help you. You can\u2019t continue to do all of this on your own, nor should you have to.", "Not going to sugar coat this, YTA. You wouldn't expect someone with no arms to be able to hug you so don't expect someone who is not able to look after your children to look after them. Your husband seems to be doing what he can given his circumstances however he sounds limited based on what info you gave and given that info you did NOT HAVE to go shopping that moment and leave him solo with your children. You sound like you may be having some caregiver fatigue and maybe need to find a way to have some you time. However please make sure to do so in a way that doesn't leave your kids solo with your husband or your husband without any help.", "YTA\n\nChristmas shopping is not an emergency. If it takes you two hours, pretty sure you can find some other days when it is convenient for you and your family to go shopping. Leaving ur toddlers with ur husband who u know damn well is unable to do much when it comes to ur children\u2019 safety is incredibly irresponsible.", "YTA, you didn't need to leave there and then. It wasn't an emergency. When you can't get suitable childcare, you rearrange your plans.\n\nI do think you and your husband should explore ways he can be with his kids and help care for them, perhaps some extra support to build his independence. I know many wheelchair users who are active and involved parents.", "Yta ,your kids could have gotten seriously hurt.  BUT your actions seem so nonsensical that I think caregiver burn out might be taking a part in your decision making, like the fact that it seems so rational to you that leaving your two extremely young children alone with your ill and disabled husband in a none emergency situation sounds like mental instability tbh .", "YTA. But I want to say that gently. You sound extremely burned out, and that could explain why you\u2019re making bad decisions like leaving them home alone with him. Are you getting any help at all?", "YTA. Your children are too young to leave with a wheelchair bound person with a serious traumatic brain injury. He physical can't handle young children. You left your children unsupervised. (Edit: The serious TBI is the obstacle,, not the wheelchair, people with physical disabilities do an excellent job of parenting all the time).\n\nA lot of areas have caregiver support groups. Find out what kind of resources are available to you and use them. You made a terrible choice. You are also under an incredible amount of stress. It's no excuse for leaving toddlers unsupervised, but it's also a reason why poor decisions get made. Get support for yourself if you aren't already.", "You get +2 points for getting ahead on your Christmas shopping but -100 points for intentionally leaving your husband, 5 YO & 3 YO in an unsafe situation.

Your husband isn't in the proper condition to save himself right now, let alone two small children.

Next ti.e, order online if you can't find someone else to watch your kids, or wait until they can.", "YTA. There is absolutely no reason you need to do Christmas shopping the first week of November. There is no reason to leave two small children with someone who literally can't take care of them. I'm having a hard time believing this is real.", "I'm sorry OP, I can't imagine how stressful your home life is right now.

You need to ask for help.", "YTA shopping is not an emergency. I get that you resent your husband for being a burden (caregiver fatigue is real) but you endangered the children; they are far too young for such limited supervision.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to need a break sometimes.

Why couldn\u2019t you do it another time when you could have arranged for a sitter?

Omg you are so lucky nothing bad happened in that time", "YTA. Christmas shopping is not an emergency and you put your children at a real risk. Absolutely unacceptable.", "YTA. Why wouldn\u2019t you have asked your MIL? Clearly she was free since she showed up anyway.", "YTA\n\nWe are only *3 days* into November.", "YTA\n\nOnline shopping is a thing.

You don't leave kids that small with someone who is incapable of caring for them properly. Had anything happened to those children your poor husband would never have forgiven himself, only it wouldn't have been his fault, it'd have been yours.

You need to be honest with yourself. You know that he can't watch them properly in case of emergency. But it is understandable that you need a break, nobody's perfect. So I would turn this situation to your own good. Publicly (I mean to your MIL and family) admit that you were wrong and thank her to proposing to babysit. Make her babysit for free.", "Yeah, YTA.\n\nChristmas shopping is not even close to being an emergency during which you HAD TO leave your very young children with someone who can't even take care of himself.\n\nMaybe your husband should be in hospital or in a facility.", "YTA and i say that gently. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s frustrating trying to coordinate for any errands and seemed reasonable in the moment but your actions were unsafe. They were unsafe for your children and your husband.

Obvs you're going through a lot. Taking care of two small children, under normal circumstances, is exhausting; on top of that, you have a husband to take care of as well. You must be exhausted all the time, and stressed out, and lonely, and I'm sorry. You desperately need a break. \n\nBut this was a bad call to make. So many things could've happened to your children while you were away, and it seems like your husband wouldn't fully register or understand it, and wouldn't be able to ask for help. It was very lucky that MIL showed up. I'm sorry she's giving you a hard time (though it can't be easy for her to see her son so vulnerable), but you definitely need to make sure you leave your kids with someone who can fully take care of them.

I know you're likely feeling trapped, overwhelmed, exhausted etc. And just needed to get some things done and needed a change of scenery and a bit of a break.

Have you contacted local organizations regarding respite care and other services for your husband and your family?", "YTA, sorry. \n\nIf your husband just had a spinal cord injury leaving him paraplegic it would be different, many wheelchair users make great parents, but the head injury makes it a no go. He's not cognitively able to care for the kids, by the sounds of it he wouldn't be able to call for help if needed or recognise a dangerous situation and act accordingly. The fact he wasn't able to stay awake shows his level of disability and it sounds like you didn't even ask MIL if she could babysit when obviously that was an option if she came over. \n\nI get needing a break from caring, I absolutely do, but you need to make sure that you put support in place first to allow for that to be done safely.", "YTA. There is no earthly reason why you meeded to Xmas shop that badly in the first week of November that you had to leave your two, under six, children with someone who is in a wheelchair and gets confused/loses track of time. \n\nWhy couldn't you wait until you could get a baby sitter? You're MIL is right (a rarity for AITA), you are very lucky she went over and the children did not injure themselves.", "YTA not a major one but you need to recognize why. It sounds like you are the sole caretaker for the 3 of them. That is extremely exhausting. I understand why you would feel you need to take a break from it. However, this was incredibly irresponsible. He is not in a state where he can be left alone with these young children. It seems he may also need consistent supervision as well. 2hrs is a long time with these conditions and it also seems you didn't put your best foot forward with trying to find help because your MIL was able to stop by. You could have asked if she'd be available. \n\nIt's important you get a break, but make sure everyone is safe FIRST. If you continue the way you are rn the next time you might not be so lucky.", "YTA, you basically left your kids by themselves and in danger. They\u2019re 3&5.

Nothing of what you were doing constituted an emergency either.  You made an awful decision.", "Yeah sorry but YTA. You are perfectly aware that your husband has limited mobility, gets confused and loses track of time... and you leave him alone with small children? You said you were in a rush but were you?

It's easy to get defensive when your ability to parent is questioned but I feel like you know there was a huge risk in what you did.

I won't be surprised if his family contacts CPS.. this should've never happened in the first place.", "YTA times infinity", "YTA. It's early November. Unless your babysitter is completely booked up for the next six weeks, you absolutely didn't need to rush out.  \n\n\nI want to clarify though that that's the only part you're TA about - leaving the kids with your husband. As everyone else is pointing out, you should have more help and I can't fault you for getting burnt out.", "NTA because I don't have the heart to call you an AH! I totally sympathize with you. No, you shouldn't have left your small children in the care of an adult who isn't medically stable at the moment. However, if your MIL had a clue, she would help out more, but she didn't show up to help out with the kids, she came over to visit with her son and then berate you and tell on you, instead of taking a step back and realizing you have 2 small kids and an adult you have to care for as an overgrown child. This is not meant to be an insult, it's just a fact, because I knew someone who was in the same situation. \n\nINSTEAD OF EVERYONE AROUND YOU BEING PART OF THE PROBLEM, PERHAPS THEY SHOULD BECOME PART OF THE SOLUTION! Like once a week, someone coming and helping with the children so you can go shopping. A day where you can just go out and decompress on your own!!\n\nBTW, who cares what your MIL is telling everyone and they're all mad. If she's that concerned she can come care for her son! She's the AH.", "OP has said in one of their only comments that when she has tried to reach out to her extended family (I.e. her MIL) they do not respond and do not help. Which means they\u2019re happy to chastise her and blame her, but give absolutely zero support. She is in a battle that she has already lost; she cannot get time by herself no matter what she does.", "Just want to add to this that if you can't take care of your husband anymore, that doesn't make you a bad person. Two very young kids and a severely disabled person is a lot to deal with. \n\nSpeaking as a disabled person, I know the pressure my health has put on my partner. He loves me and we've managed to work through it but we're incredibly lucky that we've made it. If you walk away, people who haven't been in your position will judge the hell out of you but they do not understand the pressure you are under. I know I'll probably get downvoted to hell for this but I want to tell you that if you want to walk away from your husband, that's ok. You and your kids need to be healthy and happy and if that's not possible while you're with your husband then you can walk away. Sending you hugs", "This. And seems like the MIL was maybe free and she could have asked her. IMO the MIL seems like a nightmare - instead of calling her a horrible mother, she should have asked her if she was okay and offer to help in the future.", "There are services available for respite care. \nPlease set up an appt with your husbands physician.  Have a in-depth discussion regarding level of care he needs and ask for social services to support you. This may mean he needs to be in a residential care setting. \n\nThe reality is that you may a poor decision that put the safety of your children and husband at risk.  I understand there isn\u2019t support from family so it\u2019s time to reach out to outside services", "Soft YTA, but send the husband to live with his mom if she is so worried.", "Yeah this is definitely burn out, there's no way she had to go christmas shopping almost 2 months early.  Please reach out to someone OP.", "OP commented she had to get a babysitter because the husband family don\u2019t help out. While she made a bad decision, it\u2019s obvious she needs support and is burning out.", "She probably needed some time alone. Of course she shouldn\u2019t have left her kids! But sometimes when people are overwhelmed, they don\u2019t make the best decisions.", "I couldn\u2019t have said it better myself! I get it. Caretaker burnout is *real*. But it is also NEVER EVER an excuse for putting all 3 of them in danger to go SHOPPING!! Huge YTA to this lady. She\u2019s super lucky her MIL didn\u2019t get DCF involved.", "You\u2019re being a bit harsh. OP is probably mentally and physically exhausted and wasn\u2019t thinking straight. It isn\u2019t like services and help are always readily available. It is an impossible situation", ">No unfortunately no one's willing to help. Even his mother. They'd say they'd come if I call or let them know I need help but on many ocassions they'd ignored me. Thus I hired a babysitter.\n\nJumping on the top thread to add OP's only comment thus far.\n\nThere is no help from her family or husband's family. They're happy to chastise her, but not to help. I honestly think she needs to think about whether or not this marriage is sustainable for her. It sounds like the husband needs 24/7 care, and she can't provide that while also raising kids. The MIL clearly doesn't care about the children's actual safety so much as she cares about berating OP. \n\nLike I said: rethinking the entire marriage might not be a bad idea. I am curious as to whether or not the husband is expected to improve over time, or if he is now permanently disabled.", "Oh my god, don't apologize to MIL. She can mind her business if she's not going to help. OP does need to make better decisions in the future though because this was dangerous.", "I think the lack of empathy that OP is clearly not getting in her real life makes this an ESH situation. \n\nIf MIL is able to come at the drop of a hat, why is she not helping? Of all the people who are judging and berating OP, which of them is *actively* pitching and or making themselves available?", "You can use this incident as leverage then. It's clear you need help. Not just one paid babysitter, you need his and your family to rally around and be available for Christmas shopping and just a goddam break. \n\nSend out a group message to the critics section and apologise for the lapse in judgement but that you are desperate for a break and paid babysitters aren't always available. When you ask for help, do it in the group message so everybody knows they are all flaking on you. \n\nSadly, you know you're the asshole here, the kids and even your husband were put at risk by not being supervised. But be firm with your MIL that HER SON and grandchildren need her help, if she won't do it for you.", "Since they're all chastising you, tell them this is literally your cry for help. You're overwhelmed and *need help now* and if they want to criticize you, *they should help*", "I\u2019m not entirely sure who you would ask about this (maybe your husband\u2019s doctor or insurance company?), but find respite care. Your family NEEDS it to cope in healthy ways that don\u2019t endanger anyone. And yes, AFAIK, it is possible to find FREE care. Please look into it. You all deserve better.", "I am so sorry, OP. I have 3 kids and can't imagine having to care for a husband as well. I get zero help as well, but nothing like this! Apologize for this jack of judgement, but tell all those folks that this is your call for help. They are the real AHs for leaving you to manage alone. Maybe come up with a schedule that they can follow and that can help get you time away and save money with the babysitter. You should also be eligible for aid to get care for your husband.", "Can I ask you which country are you based in please?", "But, your MIL only found out about this because she came over?", "It\u2019s unfortunate when you can\u2019t depend on family for help, but sometimes that is what it is.  Often there are places like the YMCA that have drop-in care, or possibly you can get a day or 2 a week scheduled at a daycare so you can have some time to take care of things.  Reach out to a WIC office or county social office for ideas for respite care for your husband.  \n\nI\u2019m sorry, your life sounds really challenging. But your husband is not an appropriate caregiver for your children.  I have to vote YTA, but I hope you find some help for your kids and maybe also some therapy for you to help cope with a devastating life situation.", "But it's an emergency and couldn't even wait until later in the day!! /s", "Do you also not understand caregiver burnout and that OP probably isn\u2019t in her right mind since she seems to have little help and criticism coming from those who don\u2019t help? Saying you\u2019d leave is as much an AH move as leaving someone for having a brain injury", "You mean other than the first paragraph where OP says husbands head injury renders them unable to perform basic tasks and leaves him in a state of constant confusion?\n\nI don't think any prediction was necessary", "OP commented before that she has asked for help (specifically the MIL) and she ignores her requests...\n\nYet she finds time to come over and yell at her THE ONE TIME she messes up as a result of carer burnout...", "This puts an interesting, and saddening, spin on this whole story. This OP should really take this as a wake-up call and reevaluate the situation she is living in. She is essentially a full-time parent to two toddlers AND a disabled adult. She needs help!", "Maybe MIL needs to step up and help w her son.\n\nWhy did she decide to just drop by?", "Sounds like MIL should take care of the husband and she should take care of her kids tbh.", "Oh man, this is heartbreaking. I try not to think like this about all of these threads but it's sad when this is the case. \n\nMIL just wants to yell at OP, does she drive by and only stop if she doesn't see the car so she can \"catch\" OP doing something wrong? \n\nIf you can't get any additional resources to help out OP, this might be the way to go. Let MIL take care of her son so you can focus on your kids. \n\nShe is right that you shouldn't have left your kids with him but I can understand you are burned out on caregiving. \n\nYou aren't a bad mom OP, not even close. You are a mom who is overwhelmed by what life threw at your family and you have no help from extended family.", "Agreed wholeheartedly with this. I am also curious if he will potentially improve or if this is permanent. \n\nOP - you definitely need some support; I can't imagine how hard all of this must be for you! 100% the children should not have been left alone at that age, but I can't bring myself to make a Y T A judgement on this.", "In sickness or in health.", "Yes! Thank you! Everyone is saying OP is the AH, and yes she was wrong to do this. But in OPs only comment she says none of her family or her husbands family is willing to help. So MIL isn\u2019t willing to help care for her profoundly disabled son or watch her grandchildren but she\u2019s more than happy to scream at OP when she reaches a breaking point? Yeah, it\u2019s ESH for sure. OP shouldn\u2019t have left the kids alone but this is also an impossibly difficult situation for nearly anyone. It\u2019s always the people unwilling to help who tell the caretaker how awful they\u2019re being.", "On top of the long term plans, is it possible for OP husband to get short or long term disability. If he can get a nurse a couple times a week. Not sure the extent of his injury but around the clock care and children any help would be a plus.", "Doesn't that totally contradict \"nobody is willing to help\" though? The MIL came over to check on her son, that doesn't sound like \"no help\" but what do I know \ud83e\udd37", "I do. I have a special needs son, and multiple disabilities. \n\nShe still made the wrong move. She can not put her kids in danger. She should have reached out to more than just the sitter. Like the mil. \n\nAnd yes I criticize her. Not only did she put her kids in danger,  she *came here for judgment*.\n\nNo. I said *I* have brain injuries. And that if *my partner* did the same thing *OP did*, then I would leave them. Read it again.", "I haven't seen any indication that the husband needs 24/7 care. He was asleep but fine. The concern is for the SMALL CHILDREN WHO WERE LEFT IN THE CARE OF SOMEONE WHO CAN NOT WATCH THEM. Literally the first rule of parenting is that small children need supervision by someone who can keep an eye on them, physically stop the from doing dangerous things/remove them from dangerous situations, and who can reasonably ensure their well-being. Instead of doing this, OP essentially left her children alone. Her husband has a brain injury resulting in constant confusion and, apparently, falling asleep randomly.\n\nIt's unfortunate that OP is dealing with all of this because no, she didn't ask for it. But that doesn't mean she gets a pass for neglecting the safety of the children she is legally and morally responsible for. My \"grown up brain\" actually cares about those kids, why the fuck doesn't hers?", "A support group would be a good idea, there are online ones if nothing local. A second babysitter for when she can\u2019t get a hold of the first. A respite caregiver for her husband. Ordering the shopping to be delivered. Are there programs that help cover some of the cost of these things? I\u2019d expect so but also that would depend on where OP is. \n\nOP, please do not leave your toddlers unattended again. I spent my kiddo\u2019s toddler years constantly chasing, lifting them down from stuff, helping them out from under stuff\u2014you know caring for them is a very physical job even if your husband was 100% unharmed mentally. You know this was the wrong call, and you know how you\u2019d feel if you went shopping and your kids got hurt. \n\nYour MIL still sounds like an unhelpful dick though.", "Depending on the status of of disability, if you are in the US he will qualify for some level of supportive services to help you. Both in-home and out-of home options. Out of home may be harder for you to do, but think about it because your/your kids mental and physical health is just as important.  \n\nI hope you can access support in some way! Feel free to message me with specific questions.", "Yeah the husband has to go. He\u2019s not and cannot pull his weight as a parent. It\u2019s not his fault but he needs to go where he can be cared for and OP not feel burnt out", "She has time to scream at OP but not to help", "The husband may have called before falling asleep, if he's capable of it.", "The MIL doesn't seem to care much about him, either. Hospice care might be an option, but again, I have to wonder if he's projected to get better or if his condition is permanent.", "Her health matters too, and the health and mental well-being of their children. It's not always as easy as *in sickness or in health*. He's become not only her husband's sole care-giver, but their family's sole provider and their children's only parent. If something doesn't change, and quickly, she's going to burn out and end up having a break down. Then she won't be able to take care of anyone, *herself included*...", "Unfortunately, that's not realistic. Beyond that, being his apparent full-time caretaker is going to make her resent him. And the kids. Ideally, they would find someone to do at-home care professionally, who could take some of the pressure off of OP, while allowing the husband to heal (if possible). \n\nIt's not fair to OP to be the single parent of two kids under 10 and the caretaker of her husband. She needs help. He needs help. Help might only happen if they're no longer together.\n\nEdit: uh....am I blocked by this person or did they just up and delete, cause I'm curious about the reply telling me I'm a disgusting and awful person. \n\nAnyway: 'in sickness and in health' is great. But real life doesn't work out all the time. OP cannot sustain this current situation. She is not a professional nurse. She is not trained for this. Resentment happens. Resentment can't be stopped sometimes and left to fester, it will explode. I'm sorry to burst everyone's bubble, but that's how life works out. \n\nWe all want to think that our love for people is unconditional. That it's unmitigated and unabridged. And maybe some people's love for others is; maybe it's just different for every person. You can never find a crossable line with your kids, but you can with a spouse or your siblings or your parent. But unconditional love is unrealistic because the world is full of unexpected conditions. \n\nI don't mean this as a knock towards disabled people or ill people. I've got some mental health issues that make everyone's love for me pretty conditional. You deserve love, no matter how your body or your mind exists and interacts in this world. Everyone does, and you deserve a love that can love you through struggles.\n\nBut the unfortunate truth is that not everyone is capable of that love. We all want to think we are, and many of us are. But some of us aren't, and only time will tell if OP is. \n\nAgain, I hope that they find a solution that works for them. I hope op's husband lives a long, fulfilling, joyful life-because a disability, permanent or temporary, doesn't preclude you from a long, fulfilling, joyful life-and I hope he lives it as a father and husband. \n\nBut acknowledging real possibilities is something that has to happen.", "Even that OP would need help with. Applying for disability is pretty complex, filled with appointments you CANNOT miss and most folks are denied multiple times before theyre approved. I agree its the best long term move but in the short term she'll need to work with someone on that ongoing battle too.", "Eh, if OP had no idea MIL was coming over it doesn\u2019t give her much opportunity for a break. Also idk what the MIL does while there. There\u2019s a big difference between showing up, grabbing the kiddos and/or a broom and telling OP to go get a coffee for a few minutes or take a nap or whatever, vs showing up and expecting to be entertained and brought coffee while mil tells you how dirty your house is.", "um, a mother can visit her son anytime. that isn't being willing to help, that's simply being a mom that visits lol. willing to help would be let her know days she can watch the kids/help out with the husband, or cook/help with chores so OP doesn't have to do literally everything on her own.", "You reread what I wrote. Saying you\u2019d leave your partner for making a poor decision while experiencing burnout and not being 100% there is as much an AH move as leaving them for having brain injuries. \n\nAlso you need to work on your empathy cause it sucks. You\u2019re coming off really high and mighty", "Ideally they would be able to find someone who can do in-home care. That would probably be the least disruptive option for everyone.", "I wish I had awards to give for this comment. OP, this comment is everything. There are many services that your husband could qualify for if you are in the US. I have heard that other countries have services as well. I hope you can get some in-home support for yourself and your husband. I know from experience what it is like to take care of someone who is disabled. It is lonely and exhausting. You are not a bad person for utilizing these services (trust me I had guilt that I could do all of the care by myself, but I can\u2019t).", "Home health will only be there for the husband. It wouldn\u2019t be a fix all for her exact situation. Home health will show up when they want and then they will stay just as long as alotted, usually an hour or less, and then leave. They won\u2019t do a thing to watch her kids if she needs to go somewhere. She should look into day care or an alternate babysitter or 2 that she could also call if the normal one isn\u2019t available.", "If OP is in the UK there are help for carers too. A nurse will come in a few times a week for a few hours to give the OP respite. New Zealand has something like that too.", "\"In sickness and in health... well maybe not serious sickness, just a little sickness, if it's really bad then GTFO you freeloader\"", "I don't believe hospice care is available for those who are simply profoundly disabled. I thought you have to have a terminal diagnosis to even be eligible.", "Hospice is for the terminally ill. It is to make them as comfortable as they can be in their final days. What you are thinking of is a nursing home where they will give him 24/7 care.", "No but, unfortunately, if they are in the United States, he might be entitled to more services as a single, disabled individual. It's fucked up but it is the reality of the situation.", "I didn\u2019t say divorce but he needs have his needs met and the children need to have their needs met  OP has needs as a person. She\u2019s not just a \u201cgive machine\u201d \n\nSending him where he can have his needs met is meeting the care he needs", "For hospice care, yeah, but I should have said a caretaker. People who are disabled can have at-home caretakers. Mistake on my part.", "Yup, just replied to another person. Mistake on my part!"]}
