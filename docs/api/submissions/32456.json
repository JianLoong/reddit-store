We should probably discuss this, and maybe I should apologize\" (Or something along those lines), she   Instead goes down the path of denial, and \"but its DIFFERENT in this case\" (i.e. its different because the stepfamily is the one affected now).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry about this situation.  I understand the no contact.", "NTA.  There is no such thing as replacing a loved one.  Remarrying is adding someone to your life.  Not subtracting the loved one.

That was downright abusive and it doesn't seem like your dad has learned anything.

This whole thread makes me wonder what these women died of whether dad had a hand in it.", "Cut her a little grace, she wasn't responsible for your mutual sperm donor's relentless need to dip his wick, leading to her and her siblings' creation.\n\nNevertheless, like the friends who told a man's mistress that he'd cheat on her too, you are unsurprised that daddy-dearest feels no further loyalty to the now-defunct second wife. Your half-siblings didn't have the warning that you and your brother did.\n\nHowever, it's certainly not your fault that dad has the faithfulness of a barnyard rooster, and it's definitely not your task to \"fix\" him. (If only wishes were neutered horses)\n\nYou're NTA, but do remember that your siblings do have a different viewpoint, and their emotions do have validity; just not your circus nor your monkees.", "NTA, your dad has a point, for the family unit it is ideal to have the roles of mother and father filled, and your father is entitled to his happiness and if he finds his happiness in having a wife to love and to love him back, then everyone else should support him in his pursuit of happiness.\n\nYou were lucky to have a step mother willing to look at and treat you as her own, but that doesn't mean she replaces your mother in your hearts and I'm glad your step siblings are getting a taste of their own disgustingly ignorant and selfish medicine while your dad moves on from their mom the way he did with your mom, not to say I'm glad anyone has lost their mother.\n\nAgain, NTA, I wouldn't think twice about them or what they want, they didn't and still don't have the consideration to think about your feelings and don't deserve to have you support them when they utterly refused to give you the same support they are seeking now. Hypocrites sometimes need to learn the hard way that the world doesn't revolve around them and their feelings.", "YTA", "NTA\n\nLook, I'm not going to tell anyone how to mourn or deal with grief.  I'll strongly recommend people avoid actively self-destructive responses to mourning and grief, but I won't tell someone they're wrong for looking to the future.  As such, if your dad's response to loss is to mourn briefly and then move on, more power to him.  However, he wasn't the only one grieving.  You and your brother were not ready for anyone to replace your mom, which is also perfectly fine.  No one can truly replace a loved one lost too soon, especially a parent lost to children.\n\nThe problem, then, is that your dad did not attempt to help you and your brother with your grief.  He was ready to move on, and nobody but nobody was going to stop him.  That's fine if he was single and had no children, but he wasn't and he did.  His second wife was no better, claiming to be your mother to anyone who would listen, insisting that she was a replacement for your mom.  Disgusting behavior, and nobody should blame you and your brother for not wanting anything to do with her or your father.  I certainly don't.\n\nAnd now your half-siblings come into the picture.  They spent their childhoods being told that you and your brother were supposed to love them, were supposed to be their siblings, that you should all be one big happy family; or I imagine they were told these things, at least.  And of course it never happened that way; how could it?  You can't force those familial bonds.  Maybe things would be different if your father had taken a different approach to helping you and your brother with your grief, or his second wife had taken a different approach instead of trying to replace your mother.  But that didn't happen, and when they tried to force the bond when she got pregnant, it sealed the deal.  You warned the half-siblings, if they had cared to listen.  Told them in no uncertain terms, it sounds like, that their mother was not your mother, she was just some woman your dad had married after your mother died to replace her.  The warning is clear: it could happen to you, too, and don't be surprised when it does.\n\nAnd now it has, and they are shocked and appalled.  But do they offer any sympathy?  Any commiseration?  Any apology?  No.  They come to you, expecting you to care that your father is planning to replace his second wife with a third.  And when you tell them that you warned them, and that this is not your problem, and you will not be involved, and why should you be, anyway, he's a grown man who can make his own decisions about his love life, they call you names.\n\nNo, OP, you have done nothing wrong.

What Op describes sounds forced and emotionally abusive.\nSome of the same shit I went through as a kid, but what the hell do I know with my \u201climited knowledge and education\u201d on grief.", "ew, necrophilia is gross dude", "Drop them. They are ridiculous. Tell them to leave their mom in the past and embrace the new wife as their new mom. NTA.", "They are deluded I feel for you having to go through that", "[deleted]", "Had to do something as gross as your low IQ to match.", "It's his attitude and callousness about our mom a year after she died that he is being punished for. The lack of care about the impact on us too is another part of it. It's disgusting and I have zero respect for him and his mindset. Remarrying should never mean fuck the person who died and replace them for everyone and to hell with everyone else's grief.", "Half siblings are adults.  Not children.  And if you read this properly you'd see that they perpetuated the \"give up the memory of your dead mom so your new mom can sleep better at night\" mentality.  Sorry but this is kind of karma coming back to bite them.  Plus as dear ol' dad said \"He told us once people die they need to be left in the past after a period of time and you work on filling their role and replacing them as much as you possibly can.\"  OP is NTA.", "you're a really bad troll. git gud guy", "[deleted]", "[deleted]", "You're the one who came at me. Remember that.", "And they still have the opinion that we should care as much if not more about this happening after their mom than we did after ours. I have no time for that. I fully understand why they feel the way they do. But we are not close. We will never be close. And I do not want to hold their hands through this because it will end in a fight when they bring up my/our relationship with their mom again.", "OP and her brother were children when dad remarried. The half siblings are all adults. They can figure this shit out on their own - it\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility. That\u2019s all OP is saying.", "Then why did you keep arguing with OP?", "Not sure either.  But I'm on Reddit so I figured it was a requirement."]}
