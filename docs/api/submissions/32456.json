I understand the no contact.", "NTA.  There is no such thing as replacing a loved one.  Remarrying is adding someone to your life.  Not subtracting the loved one.

That was downright abusive and it doesn't seem like your dad has learned anything.

Your half-siblings didn't have the warning that you and your brother did.\n\nHowever, it's certainly not your fault that dad has the faithfulness of a barnyard rooster, and it's definitely not your task to \"fix\" him.

I'll strongly recommend people avoid actively self-destructive responses to mourning and grief, but I won't tell someone they're wrong for looking to the future.  As such, if your dad's response to loss is to mourn briefly and then move on, more power to him.  However, he wasn't the only one grieving.  You and your brother were not ready for anyone to replace your mom, which is also perfectly fine.  No one can truly replace a loved one lost too soon, especially a parent lost to children.\n\nThe problem, then, is that your dad did not attempt to help you and your brother with your grief.  He was ready to move on, and nobody but nobody was going to stop him.  That's fine if he was single and had no children, but he wasn't and he did.  His second wife was no better, claiming to be your mother to anyone who would listen, insisting that she was a replacement for your mom.  Disgusting behavior, and nobody should blame you and your brother for not wanting anything to do with her or your father.  I certainly don't.\n\nAnd now your half-siblings come into the picture.  They spent their childhoods being told that you and your brother were supposed to love them, were supposed to be their siblings, that you should all be one big happy family; or I imagine they were told these things, at least.  And of course it never happened that way; how could it?  You can't force those familial bonds.  Maybe things would be different if your father had taken a different approach to helping you and your brother with your grief, or his second wife had taken a different approach instead of trying to replace your mother.  But that didn't happen, and when they tried to force the bond when she got pregnant, it sealed the deal.  You warned the half-siblings, if they had cared to listen.  Told them in no uncertain terms, it sounds like, that their mother was not your mother, she was just some woman your dad had married after your mother died to replace her.  The warning is clear: it could happen to you, too, and don't be surprised when it does.\n\nAnd now it has, and they are shocked and appalled.  But do they offer any sympathy?  Any commiseration?  Any apology?  No.  They come to you, expecting you to care that your father is planning to replace his second wife with a third.  And when you tell them that you warned them, and that this is not your problem, and you will not be involved, and why should you be, anyway, he's a grown man who can make his own decisions about his love life, they call you names.\n\nNo, OP, you have done nothing wrong.

Your siblings have never known another world than one in which you are the fault why the family feels broken. That is not your responsibility nor fault, but important to understand.
