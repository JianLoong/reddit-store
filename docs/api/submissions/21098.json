She called off the engagement after she walked in on her fiance and her sister, \"Betty\" (32F) in bed together. Amy told everyone and we were all on her side. Basically everyone in our family went no contact with Betty for a year when this happened but we started inviting her back to family holidays, but for birthdays and events like graduations, we don't call her. Betty and I  used to be close, but after she did what she did, I  cut her out and started hanging out with Amy more and got closer to her than I  ever was with Betty. But a few months ago, I  started hanging out with Betty again. But Amy hasn't spoken to her since she slept with her ex-fiance.\n\nAmy has recently gotten engaged again and the wedding is in like 3 months. I'm not dating anyone right now so I  was just going to invite my best friend to the wedding so we could eat, dance and be designated drivers. But Betty has been begging me to let her be my plus one. She wasn't invited and she \"Just wants to see her sister get married.\" My best friend thinks it's time they talk and some of my cousins agree with her, but my sister and my other cousins think that I  should let Amy reach out first. I  don't want to invite her but I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my family to let her come with me. \n\nWIBTA ", "created_utc": 1688255735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o9l1d/wibta_if_i_bring_my_cousin_to_a_wedding_with_me/", "score": 595, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Betty already ruined her sister\u2019s first attempt at getting married. Do not be an accomplice to her ruining the second one. \n\nIf Betty really wants a chance to reconcile with her sister, the wedding is the last place for that to happen.

She would\u2019ve been invited. That\u2019s it. No one else\u2019s opinion matters , it\u2019s her wedding she decides who gets to be there. People telling you it\u2019s a good idea are frankly ignorant. Her sister slept with her fianc\u00e9, it\u2019s easy for her to want to talk because she did the damage. The one who was affected, Amy, is the only one who gets to say when she\u2019ll talk to her sister about that. Honestly baffling how people can be so inconsiderate and think \u201cforgive and forget\u201d\u201dhave to forgive family \u201c\u2026she crossed the line. Cheaters shouldn\u2019t be forgiven imo.", "YWBTA if you invited Betty. I'm appalled you're even considering it. It's up to the bride and groom whom to invite to the wedding. You don't sneak someone in that you already know they don't want there. You would be overstepping by miles. It is not up to your best friend or your cousins to make the decision that it's time for for Amy to get over Betty ripping her life apart. That choice is strictly up to Amy. Do not do this. You'll create a scene at the wedding and Amy will cut you out of her life forever.", "YWBTA - This is Amy her wedding, and if Betty is not invited, that's between them to discuss. Going behind Amy's back will only make her feel like you are just as untrustworthy as Betty, whom she distrusts with very good reason.\n\nDon't make this decision for her, and tell your family to stop pressuring you. Invite your BF and go have fun. The people pressuring you can take Betty themselves if they feel so strongly, but I doubt they want to be the center of negative attention, so they are more than happy to let you take the fall.", "YWBTA\n\nAnd a massive AH if you do it. Because she was betrayed by her sister, Amy consciously refused to invite Betty to the wedding. Who are you to decide that Betty should still come, against the wishes of the bride???

She hasn\u2019t even spoken to her since the incident. \n\nYour family don\u2019t even invite her to birthday parties. They think that Amy should reconnect with Betty at her wedding?? Her last to-be fianc\u00e9e/wedding was ruined by Betty, not to mention her trust and respect. \n\nI am angry for Amy for y\u2019all even considering it. It would ruin her entire day, Betty has already ruined enough in Amy\u2019s life. \n\nYou should definitely let Amy know the situation so she can get ahead of it, and let her decide if she wants to reconnect. If I was Amy I would feel betrayed by the entire family if Betty showed up at my wedding because of them.", "YWBTA and if you continue to get pressure from your family read these comments to them because internet strangers are doing a better job of protecting Amy than her family is.", "YWBTA. This is a terrible, terrible idea. She was not invited for very good reason and you plan to shit all over Amy which will absolutely make things go nuclear. Do not bring her.", "Noooooo!  Don't do it!

You would absolutely be TA. How the fuck would it do anything other than ruin Amy\u2019s day? If you think you can magically fix their relationship, you\u2019re ridiculous. \n\nBetty clearly doesn\u2019t have remorse for what she did if she\u2019s trying to manipulate your naive ass into a plus one role. If she wanted to show remorse and try and have some kind of relationship with her sister, there are ways to do that. This move is nasty and petty and would only be about herself.", "Think about this for just one moment\u2026.Betty slept with Amy\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9 what on Gods green earth makes you think she would want Betty near her new husband AT HER WEDDING!!? Of all times and places THIS is not it. This would be extremely triggering for Amy and would completely ruin her day in every way. \n\nUltimately this isn\u2019t up to you or anyone else. This is Amy\u2019s decision and if you pull this stunt you will lose not only Amy but many other family members too. Is forcing Betty on Amy like that worth it?", "YWBTA. This was a hurtful thing that your cousin went through. This is not something you can just \u201cget over\u201d. If you want to hang out with her that\u2019s your business, but why bring her to an event that she should have had with her last fianc\u00e9? Also, did she ever even apologize? Cause if not, she definitely shouldn\u2019t go", "I can't believe you are actually asking this. If you do that you are a snake just like Betty. So yeah, ywbta. Amy clearly doesn't want to talk to Betty or have any kind of relationship with her. Don't ruin Amy's wedding and your relationship with her by taking Betty as a plus one. Amy clearly has no issue cutting off Betty, she definitely would cut you off too and she would be right to do so if you invite Betty to her wedding. learn how to read the room!!!", "Let one of those nosey MFers take her - YWBTA if you do it", "YWBTA\n\nShe wasn't invited for a reason. Don't let her talk you into starting drama", "Don\u2019t go there. Bad idea", "WTAF.  Yes, OF COURSE YWBTA!  I'm going to cut you some slack because you're 18, but god, this is a no brainer.  You're essentially asking if you can ruin your cousin's wedding with unnecessary drama.  Do not do this unless you never want Amy to ever talk to you again, and by the way, that would be well-deserved.", "ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n\nYou would ruin Amy\u2019s day. Do not bring her.", "Do not do this - Betty literally FAFO. If you do this, you will lose Amy and the branch of the family who support Amy. It\u2019s Amy\u2019s and her future spouses day, not Betty\u2019s and a wedding/birthday/significant family event is not the time to force reconciliation.\n\nIf you turn up with Betty as your +1, I can pretty much advise that Amy will have people on standby to escort Betty and party (ie you) out.

It's no one's business if they talk or not, why do you think it's appropriate to take her to Amy's wedding when you and everyone else knows she cut her out of her life. Do you not realize the drama/problems this will cause? Are you prepared to have Amy cut you out of her life?  If she wants to talk to her sister she can pick another event other than her wedding.

Take a friend, find a tinder date, idk maybe go solo BUT DO NOT TAKE BETTY!!!\n\nLike have some common sense if they are not talking and she was not invited it's because Amy does not want Betty in her life and especially not at her wedding.

If you managed to hide it from Amy on the day she would find out after the fact and it would still be not only devastating that the sister who betrayed her snuck in BUT Amy would feel the same betrayal for you and cut you off for good. Do you want that? Do you want to be the villain of this story?\n\nBecause Betty is already the bad guy, even if she think she has 'good' intentions.

If she hasn't invited Betty that tells you everything you need to know.\n\n\nETA: You're 18, Betty is 32. She's a whole arsed adult trying to manipulate you. Betty shouldn't be hanging out with you like you're both adult besties, and if she's only recently started wanting to hang out with you (especially if it's been since the wedding was announced) I would say she intentionally targeted you because you're so much younger.\n\nTake it from a mid 30's person with a similar age gap between myself and my youngest cousin. \n\nIn fact, ask around the family - you may not be the first/only person she's asked to sneak her into the wedding.\n\nDon't make yourself the family outcast, you're still a child (I say that with understanding and facts, not an insult) losing contact with loved ones over this at such a pivotal age would be something that affects you for years.", "YWBTA.

If you bring Betty, you will be just as awful as Betty \n\nIf Betty has really become a better person, which I doubt she has, she would never think that reconciliation at Amy's wedding would be a good idea. Only a narcissist, who wants to make the wedding about her, would go to the wedding. Because the minute Amy sees Betty, the wedding will stop being about the love/union of Amy and her fiance but about Betty fucking her ex fiance. Don't fall for the peer pressure.

Blindsiding Amy on her wedding day by bringing Betty without Amy\u2019s prior consent will guarantee the death of your relationship with Amy and possibly even more family members. Your judgement will be forever questioned and the trust they currently have in you will be broken. Just don\u2019t do it.", "YWBTA for sure. Even if it were \"time for them to talk again\" her wedding is not a place for that AT ALL. And she should definitely have a say in when/if it happens.", "Don\u2019t do anything uninvited, talk to Amy and let her know what her sister wants. If she wants to accept her to see her wedding that\u2019s her choice. Don\u2019t ruin anything by \u201csurprises\u201d.", "Don't do it dude", "Yta for even considering it.", "You really wrote this out and can\u2019t see your an AH?", "YWBTA without a shred of doubt.\nIt is not your place to handle their massive problem. Go with your best friend and avoid the complete dumpster fire that would be caused if you came with your cousine.", "YWBTA \ud83d\udcaf do not do this. I repeat - DO NOT DO THIS.", "YWBTA. Do not bring her to the wedding. If Amy wanted her there, she would have invited her herself. You are going to cause a disturbance and possibly ruin your cousins wedding day.", "They need to talk, but the wedding IS NOT THE TIME OR PLACE for it.\n\nThe end.", "YWBTA, don't surprise the bride by bringing someone they revile unannounced, duh", "OP, think long, hard and clearly about this. Amy cut contact with Betty because Betty was sleeping with Amy's ex-fiance.\n\nBetty's actions hurt Amy. Amy decided to cut contact from the person that hurt her. Now Betty, who hurt Amy, believes she is entitled to attend Amy's wedding because they're sisters and she believes that gives her the right to dictate the situation and force herself where she clearly isn't wanted.\n\nYWBTA if you allow Betty to use you like this. Please refer to the above statement, Betty hurt Amy. How do you think Amy will feel when on her big day she scans the crowd and sees the person that ruined her relationship once already?\n\nNow there may be many reasons you feel that taking Betty would be the right thing to do. Such as;\n\n1. Betty and Amy are family, this does not matter in the way most would think it does. It's precisely because she's family that Betty's actions are seriously wrong. Amy was blindsided and betrayed by the person she thought she could trust.\n\n2. It was so long ago, this does not matter at all. Amy was the one hurt by the ordeal and it is up to her to heal at her own pace. If in her healing she doesn't want to see Betty at her wedding, she's entitled to that and that should be respected.\n\n3. Best Friend says \"It's about time for us to talk.\" Bestie is in no position to decide when Amy forgives. Bestie is in no position to decide how Amy heals. Bestie is in no position to decide that Amy has had long enough to be hurt, now her and Betty have to play happy family again just because Amy is getting married and Betty wants to be a part of it. That's the same as if Betty had stabbed Amy's hand with a fork, Amy cut contact with Betty for her own safety, but now that Amy's hand has healed a random stranger comes strutting in telling Amy that she needs to start forgiving because she's all better now.\n\nIf you have any respect for Amy at all, do not bring Betty.", "YTA Absolutely not, a wedding is not a place for them to make up. Do you want to ruin it for her a 2nd time? Don't be that person.", "Yes, you absolutely WBTA\n\nNo idea if Betty's motives are genuine or not, but if she turns up then all the attention will be on her, not the bride. Her and Amy 'reuniting' will be the focus of the day, not Amy and her fianc\u0117 expressing their love and commitment. Amy will feel under pressure to behave a certain way and the wedding is at risk for being remembered for all the wrong reasons if she doesn't. \n\nThe correct way to deal with it is:\n\n* Tell Betty she needs to talk to Amy and work it out with her\n* Tell Amy that Betty's trying to get into her wedding and leave her and her fianc\u0117 to deal with it\n* Tell the rest of the family that you don't want to get involved and it's up to the two of them to work it out between them. \n\nWeddings are stressful enough without using them to host an impromptu family reunion.", "You would definitely be the AH if you do this. The wedding isn\u2019t the place for this. put yourself in her shoes. Would you want someone to ruin one of the best days of your life by doing this? You know it\u2019s not right just for asking advice on this subject. Please don\u2019t be selfish.", "YWBTA. Don\u2019t do it.", "YWBTA, 100%. \n\nBe prepared to say goodbye to your relationship with Amy if you go through with it.", "YWBTA. It's not Betty's day, it's Amy's. \n\nIf you and your family think the relationship wrecking cousin getting to see her sister get married is more important than what Amy wants on that day, you are all insane. If Amy wanted Betty there she would have asked her. Inviting Betty basically ruins something relationship wise for Amy a second time. Betty's invite was not lost in the post, she was deliberately excluded. You bring Betty and everyone at the wedding is going to be talking about Betty being there and bot the wedding actually taking place. There is no way this won't cause drama of some kind.\n\nIf you invite Betty I would imagine Amy will be cutting you and possibly the extended family who encouraged it off too. It would show you are all there for Betty but not her and you all put Betty above her. A wedding isn't time to build bridges. \n\nAmy doesn't want Betty there because she betrayed her. Regardless of the relationship either Amy or Betty have ended up in with thier respective partners its the betrayal Amy doesn't forgive.Her sister who is supposed to have her back, showed she doesn't and she is willing to hurt her sister in the worst way. Betty should back the f off and accept she lost the right to be in her sisters life the minute she decided not to act anything like a sister.", "I understand you want to be a mediator or peacemaker, but guess what Amy\u2019s first reaction will be if she sees her sister there? - \u201cwhat, you\u2019re here to fuck my current fianc\u00e9 too?\u201d.   \nstay away from the situation or YWBTA.", "I still to this day can\u2019t wrap my head around how people fuck their brother or sister\u2019s significant other. What in the entire fuck would possess someone to stoop that low!", "Serious question but have you always been a fuckin idiot?", "So she sleeps with her sisters fiance (unforgivable) and now wants to show up to her sisters new engagement with her new man? Yeah YWBTA and Amy cut off her sister after what she's done to her, she won't think twice about cutting you off if you bring her. Let Amy enjoy her new found happiness and don't have her wreck this engagement as well. I would never trust Betty around anyone I bring into my life ever again if I was Amy, that goes for friends as well as significant others. Betty wants to see her sis get married... Then she shouldn't have slept with her sisters fiance. Amy sounds like such a strong person to find love again after the ultimate betrayal from FAMILY, let her be happy she deserves it. Do not ruin her day.", "YWBTA: dang\u2026.Amy can\u2019t get any peace. So you want her sister to ruin her wedding again? That would absolutely ruin her wedding again with different circumstances.\n\nAmy would then cut you out of her life if she is capable of cutting her own sister out (rightfully so). What are you thinking OP? How are we not able to understand what this action could do to Amy. \nAlso f@$k Betty, she is selfish as hell. She should have thought about her sister years ago before sleeping with her then fianc\u00e9. She doesn\u2019t deserve to see her sister getting married.", "YWBTA\n\nDo not do that.", "YWBTA. So your best friend really thinks Amy's wedding day is the right day for her to talk again to her traitorous sister who screwed up her previous wedding plans??? By what weird logic? I can't even begin to understand how you can even doubt whether you should take Betty or not. If you want to ruin Amy's wedding and your relationship with Amy, go ahead, bring Betty. But don't pull out your Pikachu face when you see the disastrous consequences of this stupid act. You'd better warn Amy that her sister is out to ruin her marriage again (because it's so obvious that's what she's after, don't be naive) if you've become as close as you say you have.", "She might as well go sleep with her fianc\u00e9 while she\u2019s at it!", "I\u2019m inclined to agree. This is the kind of thing that you should just KNOW is wrong, regardless of pressure, and 18 is more than old enough to have some common sense and empathy.", ".... \"just want to see if my sister's husband-to-be is f\"ckable.\"", "She just wants to sleep with her fiance again more like...", "Could you tl;dr why?"]}
