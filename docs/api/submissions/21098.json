She called off the engagement after she walked in on her fiance and her sister, \"Betty\" (32F) in bed together. Amy told everyone and we were all on her side. Basically everyone in our family went no contact with Betty for a year when this happened but we started inviting her back to family holidays, but for birthdays and events like graduations, we don't call her. Betty and I  used to be close, but after she did what she did, I  cut her out and started hanging out with Amy more and got closer to her than I  ever was with Betty. But a few months ago, I  started hanging out with Betty again. But Amy hasn't spoken to her since she slept with her ex-fiance.\n\nAmy has recently gotten engaged again and the wedding is in like 3 months. I'm not dating anyone right now so I  was just going to invite my best friend to the wedding so we could eat, dance and be designated drivers. But Betty has been begging me to let her be my plus one. She wasn't invited and she \"Just wants to see her sister get married.\" My best friend thinks it's time they talk and some of my cousins agree with her, but my sister and my other cousins think that I  should let Amy reach out first. I  don't want to invite her but I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my family to let her come with me. \n\nWIBTA ", "created_utc": 1688255735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o9l1d/wibta_if_i_bring_my_cousin_to_a_wedding_with_me/", "score": 26, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Absolutely do not entertain this idea, shut it down and tell Amy that her sister is trying to find a way to get into the wedding and let her decide.", "you *absolutely* would be TA. if Amy wanted Betty at her wedding, she would\u2019ve invited her. that is not your choice to make for her. do you think she wants to be reminded on her literal wedding day how her last engagement ended so horribly? she most likely already struggles with trust, please don\u2019t betray her as well. if Betty wanted to see her sister get married then she shouldn\u2019t have fucked her sister\u2019s fiance.", "YWBTA big time! Ruin her wedding? The day she's been planning and looking forward to with family from both sides that they love?\n\nYour other cousin is being manipulative! It would make the entire day about her and cause drama. \n\nShe's using you!", "YWBTA\n\nDo not, under any circumstance bring Betty with you. I can tell you now, you will get caught in the crossfire. \n\nThat could be anything from:  \n- being kicked out of the wedding\n- being cut out of Amy\u2019s life \n- bring seen as choosing sides\n\nStay out of it. \n\nIf Betty truly cared and wanted her sister\u2019s forgiveness then she would do everything in her power to reach out to her directly. And failing that, she would respect Amy\u2019s wishes and stay well away.", "Do NOT do that.  Do not. YWBTA, and an enormous one.  Stay the hell out of it", "You need to warn Amy. Betty already ruined her sister\u2019s first attempt at getting married. Do not be an accomplice to her ruining the second one. \n\nIf Betty really wants a chance to reconcile with her sister, the wedding is the last place for that to happen. Honestly, I don\u2019t believe Betty has anything but evil intentions. Only someone who hates her sister and is horribly jealous would sleep with the fianc\u00e9. \n\nYWBTA big time if you go along with this nefarious plot.", "YWBTA,\n\nIf Amy wanted her there. She would\u2019ve been invited. That\u2019s it. No one else\u2019s opinion matters , it\u2019s her wedding she decides who gets to be there. People telling you it\u2019s a good idea are frankly ignorant. Her sister slept with her fianc\u00e9, it\u2019s easy for her to want to talk because she did the damage. The one who was affected, Amy, is the only one who gets to say when she\u2019ll talk to her sister about that. Honestly baffling how people can be so inconsiderate and think \u201cforgive and forget\u201d\u201dhave to forgive family \u201c\u2026she crossed the line. Cheaters shouldn\u2019t be forgiven imo.", "YWBTA if you invited Betty. I'm appalled you're even considering it. It's up to the bride and groom whom to invite to the wedding. You don't sneak someone in that you already know they don't want there. You would be overstepping by miles. It is not up to your best friend or your cousins to make the decision that it's time for for Amy to get over Betty ripping her life apart. That choice is strictly up to Amy. Do not do this. You'll create a scene at the wedding and Amy will cut you out of her life forever.", "YWBTA - This is Amy her wedding, and if Betty is not invited, that's between them to discuss. Going behind Amy's back will only make her feel like you are just as untrustworthy as Betty, whom she distrusts with very good reason.\n\nDon't make this decision for her, and tell your family to stop pressuring you. Invite your BF and go have fun. The people pressuring you can take Betty themselves if they feel so strongly, but I doubt they want to be the center of negative attention, so they are more than happy to let you take the fall.", "YWBTA\n\nAnd a massive AH if you do it. Because she was betrayed by her sister, Amy consciously refused to invite Betty to the wedding. Who are you to decide that Betty should still come, against the wishes of the bride??? It's not your wedding, you are a guest.\n\nIf you still go through with this idea, don't be surprised to see drama at the wedding, and to eventually be cut off by Amy and some other family members...", "You would so be TA. \n\nIf Amy wanted Betty at her wedding she would have invited her. She hasn\u2019t even spoken to her since the incident. \n\nYour family don\u2019t even invite her to birthday parties. They think that Amy should reconnect with Betty at her wedding?? Her last to-be fianc\u00e9e/wedding was ruined by Betty, not to mention her trust and respect. \n\nI am angry for Amy for y\u2019all even considering it. It would ruin her entire day, Betty has already ruined enough in Amy\u2019s life. \n\nYou should definitely let Amy know the situation so she can get ahead of it, and let her decide if she wants to reconnect. If I was Amy I would feel betrayed by the entire family if Betty showed up at my wedding because of them.", "YWBTA and if you continue to get pressure from your family read these comments to them because internet strangers are doing a better job of protecting Amy than her family is.", "YWBTA. This is a terrible, terrible idea. She was not invited for very good reason and you plan to shit all over Amy which will absolutely make things go nuclear. Do not bring her.", "Noooooo!  Don't do it!  YWBTA and ruin the wedding and cause more family drama.", "YWBTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo you want to ruin the wedding and be the family outcast for the rest of your life.", "Are you serious??? You would absolutely be TA. How the fuck would it do anything other than ruin Amy\u2019s day? If you think you can magically fix their relationship, you\u2019re ridiculous. \n\nBetty clearly doesn\u2019t have remorse for what she did if she\u2019s trying to manipulate your naive ass into a plus one role. If she wanted to show remorse and try and have some kind of relationship with her sister, there are ways to do that. This move is nasty and petty and would only be about herself.", "Think about this for just one moment\u2026.Betty slept with Amy\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9 what on Gods green earth makes you think she would want Betty near her new husband AT HER WEDDING!!? Of all times and places THIS is not it. This would be extremely triggering for Amy and would completely ruin her day in every way. \n\nUltimately this isn\u2019t up to you or anyone else. This is Amy\u2019s decision and if you pull this stunt you will lose not only Amy but many other family members too. Is forcing Betty on Amy like that worth it?", "YWBTA. This was a hurtful thing that your cousin went through. This is not something you can just \u201cget over\u201d. If you want to hang out with her that\u2019s your business, but why bring her to an event that she should have had with her last fianc\u00e9? Also, did she ever even apologize? Cause if not, she definitely shouldn\u2019t go", "I can't believe you are actually asking this. If you do that you are a snake just like Betty. So yeah, ywbta. Amy clearly doesn't want to talk to Betty or have any kind of relationship with her. Don't ruin Amy's wedding and your relationship with her by taking Betty as a plus one. Amy clearly has no issue cutting off Betty, she definitely would cut you off too and she would be right to do so if you invite Betty to her wedding. learn how to read the room!!!", "Let one of those nosey MFers take her - YWBTA if you do it", "YWBTA\n\nShe wasn't invited for a reason. Don't let her talk you into starting drama", "Don\u2019t go there. Bad idea", "WTAF.  Yes, OF COURSE YWBTA!  I'm going to cut you some slack because you're 18, but god, this is a no brainer.  You're essentially asking if you can ruin your cousin's wedding with unnecessary drama.  Do not do this unless you never want Amy to ever talk to you again, and by the way, that would be well-deserved.", "ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n\nYou would ruin Amy\u2019s day. Do not bring her.", "Do not do this - Betty literally FAFO. If you do this, you will lose Amy and the branch of the family who support Amy. It\u2019s Amy\u2019s and her future spouses day, not Betty\u2019s and a wedding/birthday/significant family event is not the time to force reconciliation.\n\nIf you turn up with Betty as your +1, I can pretty much advise that Amy will have people on standby to escort Betty and party (ie you) out.

If you  \"surprise\" her with that on her wedding day, expect to be thrown out and never spoken to again. \n\nBe a good cousin and warn Amy that her sister is trying to get in as your plus one so that she can make it very clear to all guests that anybody who turns up with her will be barred.", "YWBTA.  Don\u2019t do it!  Don\u2019t get in middle of sisters especially when there is such a big betrayal driving the wedge.  If you did this you would turn Amy\u2019s special day and make it about what Betty wants and this day is about Amy.  She is proving again to be a very selfish person and has no right to put you in the middle.  I\u2019m sorry you are still very young, and might have the best of intentions but you need to stay out of it.", "AMY\u2019S WEDDING DAY IS NOT THE TIME FOR THEM TO TALK. IF SHE WANTED HER CHEATING SISTER AT HER WEDDING SHE WOULD HAVE INVITED HER. \n\nDO NOT EVEN CONSIDER THIS. \n\nYWBTAH 1000000000%", "Absolutely would be TA.  Like making a statement of what an AH you were bringing her on what\u2019s supposed to be one of the happiest days of her life. Wtf", "Of course you\u2019d BTA! What a betrayal. It\u2019s not your place to invite the traitorous sister", "YWBTA. Even if it's time for them to start talking again, showing up at Amy's wedding uninvited is not the way to do that. It could ruin her big day and will likely be counter-productive to them restarting their relationship.", "OMG YESSS YWBTA!!! Stay out of it, by taking her you would be ruining her wedding. It's no one's business if they talk or not, why do you think it's appropriate to take her to Amy's wedding when you and everyone else knows she cut her out of her life. Do you not realize the drama/problems this will cause? Are you prepared to have Amy cut you out of her life?  If she wants to talk to her sister she can pick another event other than her wedding. Amy's wedding is not the time or place to do it. Also have you thought that maybe Betty has an ulterior motive to go to Amy's wedding? Take a friend, find a tinder date, idk maybe go solo BUT DO NOT TAKE BETTY!!!\n\nLike have some common sense if they are not talking and she was not invited it's because Amy does not want Betty in her life and especially not at her wedding. Would you want to have the person who slept with your ex fianc\u00e9e at your wedding? If you were in that situation would you be okay with this? Let's be real you wouldn't and you and your cousins should not expect her to be okay with it. Just butt out and take someone else or go solo.", "YWNBTA. If you did that to me I would never speak to you again. Ever.", "No, she shouldn't do \"anything in her power\". That would arguably include attending the wedding, and it would be massively stomping the boundaries of someone whose made it clear they don't want to talk to you."]}
