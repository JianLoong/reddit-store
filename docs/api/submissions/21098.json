She called off the engagement after she walked in on her fiance and her sister, \"Betty\" (32F) in bed together. Amy told everyone and we were all on her side. Basically everyone in our family went no contact with Betty for a year when this happened but we started inviting her back to family holidays, but for birthdays and events like graduations, we don't call her. Betty and I  used to be close, but after she did what she did, I  cut her out and started hanging out with Amy more and got closer to her than I  ever was with Betty. But a few months ago, I  started hanging out with Betty again. But Amy hasn't spoken to her since she slept with her ex-fiance.\n\nAmy has recently gotten engaged again and the wedding is in like 3 months. I'm not dating anyone right now so I  was just going to invite my best friend to the wedding so we could eat, dance and be designated drivers. But Betty has been begging me to let her be my plus one. She wasn't invited and she \"Just wants to see her sister get married.\" My best friend thinks it's time they talk and some of my cousins agree with her, but my sister and my other cousins think that I  should let Amy reach out first. I  don't want to invite her but I'm feeling a lot of pressure from my family to let her come with me. \n\nWIBTA ", "created_utc": 1688255735, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14o9l1d/wibta_if_i_bring_my_cousin_to_a_wedding_with_me/", "score": 232, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Betty already ruined her sister\u2019s first attempt at getting married. Do not be an accomplice to her ruining the second one. \n\nIf Betty really wants a chance to reconcile with her sister, the wedding is the last place for that to happen. Honestly, I don\u2019t believe Betty has anything but evil intentions.

She would\u2019ve been invited. That\u2019s it. No one else\u2019s opinion matters , it\u2019s her wedding she decides who gets to be there. People telling you it\u2019s a good idea are frankly ignorant. Her sister slept with her fianc\u00e9, it\u2019s easy for her to want to talk because she did the damage. The one who was affected, Amy, is the only one who gets to say when she\u2019ll talk to her sister about that. Honestly baffling how people can be so inconsiderate and think \u201cforgive and forget\u201d\u201dhave to forgive family \u201c\u2026she crossed the line. Cheaters shouldn\u2019t be forgiven imo.", "YWBTA if you invited Betty. I'm appalled you're even considering it. It's up to the bride and groom whom to invite to the wedding. You don't sneak someone in that you already know they don't want there. You would be overstepping by miles. It is not up to your best friend or your cousins to make the decision that it's time for for Amy to get over Betty ripping her life apart. That choice is strictly up to Amy. Do not do this. You'll create a scene at the wedding and Amy will cut you out of her life forever.", "YWBTA - This is Amy her wedding, and if Betty is not invited, that's between them to discuss. Going behind Amy's back will only make her feel like you are just as untrustworthy as Betty, whom she distrusts with very good reason.\n\nDon't make this decision for her, and tell your family to stop pressuring you. Invite your BF and go have fun. The people pressuring you can take Betty themselves if they feel so strongly, but I doubt they want to be the center of negative attention, so they are more than happy to let you take the fall.", "YWBTA\n\nAnd a massive AH if you do it. Because she was betrayed by her sister, Amy consciously refused to invite Betty to the wedding. Who are you to decide that Betty should still come, against the wishes of the bride???

She hasn\u2019t even spoken to her since the incident. \n\nYour family don\u2019t even invite her to birthday parties. They think that Amy should reconnect with Betty at her wedding?? Her last to-be fianc\u00e9e/wedding was ruined by Betty, not to mention her trust and respect. \n\nI am angry for Amy for y\u2019all even considering it. It would ruin her entire day, Betty has already ruined enough in Amy\u2019s life. \n\nYou should definitely let Amy know the situation so she can get ahead of it, and let her decide if she wants to reconnect. If I was Amy I would feel betrayed by the entire family if Betty showed up at my wedding because of them.", "YWBTA and if you continue to get pressure from your family read these comments to them because internet strangers are doing a better job of protecting Amy than her family is.", "YWBTA. This is a terrible, terrible idea. She was not invited for very good reason and you plan to shit all over Amy which will absolutely make things go nuclear. Do not bring her.", "Noooooo!  Don't do it!

You would absolutely be TA. How the fuck would it do anything other than ruin Amy\u2019s day? If you think you can magically fix their relationship, you\u2019re ridiculous. \n\nBetty clearly doesn\u2019t have remorse for what she did if she\u2019s trying to manipulate your naive ass into a plus one role. If she wanted to show remorse and try and have some kind of relationship with her sister, there are ways to do that. This move is nasty and petty and would only be about herself.", "Think about this for just one moment\u2026.Betty slept with Amy\u2019s ex-fianc\u00e9 what on Gods green earth makes you think she would want Betty near her new husband AT HER WEDDING!!? Of all times and places THIS is not it. This would be extremely triggering for Amy and would completely ruin her day in every way. \n\nUltimately this isn\u2019t up to you or anyone else. This is Amy\u2019s decision and if you pull this stunt you will lose not only Amy but many other family members too. Is forcing Betty on Amy like that worth it?", "YWBTA. This was a hurtful thing that your cousin went through. This is not something you can just \u201cget over\u201d. If you want to hang out with her that\u2019s your business, but why bring her to an event that she should have had with her last fianc\u00e9? Also, did she ever even apologize? Cause if not, she definitely shouldn\u2019t go", "I can't believe you are actually asking this. If you do that you are a snake just like Betty. So yeah, ywbta. Amy clearly doesn't want to talk to Betty or have any kind of relationship with her. Don't ruin Amy's wedding and your relationship with her by taking Betty as a plus one. Amy clearly has no issue cutting off Betty, she definitely would cut you off too and she would be right to do so if you invite Betty to her wedding. learn how to read the room!!!", "Let one of those nosey MFers take her - YWBTA if you do it", "YWBTA\n\nShe wasn't invited for a reason. Don't let her talk you into starting drama", "Don\u2019t go there. Bad idea", "WTAF.  Yes, OF COURSE YWBTA!  I'm going to cut you some slack because you're 18, but god, this is a no brainer.  You're essentially asking if you can ruin your cousin's wedding with unnecessary drama.  Do not do this unless you never want Amy to ever talk to you again, and by the way, that would be well-deserved.", "ABSOLUTELY NOT!\n\nYou would ruin Amy\u2019s day. Do not bring her.", "Do not do this - Betty literally FAFO. If you do this, you will lose Amy and the branch of the family who support Amy. It\u2019s Amy\u2019s and her future spouses day, not Betty\u2019s and a wedding/birthday/significant family event is not the time to force reconciliation.\n\nIf you turn up with Betty as your +1, I can pretty much advise that Amy will have people on standby to escort Betty and party (ie you) out.

It's no one's business if they talk or not, why do you think it's appropriate to take her to Amy's wedding when you and everyone else knows she cut her out of her life. Do you not realize the drama/problems this will cause? Are you prepared to have Amy cut you out of her life?  If she wants to talk to her sister she can pick another event other than her wedding.

Take a friend, find a tinder date, idk maybe go solo BUT DO NOT TAKE BETTY!!!\n\nLike have some common sense if they are not talking and she was not invited it's because Amy does not want Betty in her life and especially not at her wedding.

If you managed to hide it from Amy on the day she would find out after the fact and it would still be not only devastating that the sister who betrayed her snuck in BUT Amy would feel the same betrayal for you and cut you off for good. Do you want that? Do you want to be the villain of this story?\n\nBecause Betty is already the bad guy, even if she think she has 'good' intentions.

If she hasn't invited Betty that tells you everything you need to know.\n\n\nETA: You're 18, Betty is 32. She's a whole arsed adult trying to manipulate you. Betty shouldn't be hanging out with you like you're both adult besties, and if she's only recently started wanting to hang out with you (especially if it's been since the wedding was announced) I would say she intentionally targeted you because you're so much younger.\n\nTake it from a mid 30's person with a similar age gap between myself and my youngest cousin. \n\nIn fact, ask around the family - you may not be the first/only person she's asked to sneak her into the wedding.\n\nDon't make yourself the family outcast, you're still a child (I say that with understanding and facts, not an insult) losing contact with loved ones over this at such a pivotal age would be something that affects you for years.", "YWBTA.

If you bring Betty, you will be just as awful as Betty \n\nIf Betty has really become a better person, which I doubt she has, she would never think that reconciliation at Amy's wedding would be a good idea. Only a narcissist, who wants to make the wedding about her, would go to the wedding. Because the minute Amy sees Betty, the wedding will stop being about the love/union of Amy and her fiance but about Betty fucking her ex fiance. Don't fall for the peer pressure.

That is not something that Amy is likely to EVER forgive, and if she does, it's her decision to make whether to resume contact with Betty or not.
