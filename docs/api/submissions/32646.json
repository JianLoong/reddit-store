If I was 16, that would be absolutely beyond lame.  Everyone should know that.  NTA  It sounds terrible and you don't owe anyone an apology.", "NTA\n\nI really feel like this doesnt need much explanation, sure you couldve put it a little more delicately and maybe could be beneficial to apologize, but idk who thinks a 16 y/o dude wants a tea party.", "NTA. She should have asked about how many guests *before* everything was arranged.\n\nHow could she believe teenagers would think a tea party is a good idea? Is she that out of touch? She never, in all those years, bothered to ask what you'd like.", "NTA. She's doing it for her, not for you. If she cared about your opinion, she would have asked you about it a long time ago.", "Do the tea party with your father, then meet your friends for dinner. I never would have invited my friends to a tea party as teenager. NTA", "INFO: Are you English and this is a meal or is it like...a tea party like ladies have?", "NTA. How much organizing is involved in a tea party anyway? You get some cookies and you pop the kettle on. That is pretty much it.", "NTA \n\nYou're not an asshole for wanting to celebrate your birthday any way you want but maybe you should have said you didn't like the tea party in a more delicate way", "NTA I had one birthday at this expensive hotel with tea and biscuits where me and my friends got all dressed up but I was 7 so the dressing up and being fancy was fun. It\u2019s not thing it frankly mine anymore", "Parents are a bit tone deaf. NTA although a bit harsh. There was probably a kinder way to express that.", "I'd say NAH currently. One of the things you should learn is talking about your feelings before you're put on the spot and it's too late to change anything. You put your opinion in a way that is hurtful with no care about what it means to others. It isn't fair that your own birthday dropped off, but you could have just said you want to keep doing what you've been doing of having a separate friends and you only party.", "I think that maybe you could\u2019ve explained to them that you would prefer to not have a tea party for your group of friends. I understand you\u2019re likely even too big for arcades and stuff like that but you could have put forth ideas where you guys could still celebrate together. Dad and fam have tea party while you and your boys have pizza and watch football or play PS4. Everyone eats cake together. Idk. You could have broke it to them more gently that you\u2019re too old and too young for for tea parties", "I\u2019ll go ESH, because your parents are ridiculously naive (and I say that as someone who loves tea). But it\u2019s a pretty safe assumption a teenage boy is not a fan of tea. That said, this is your lesson in communicating. Don\u2019t assume people know what you like because it seems obvious to you. It\u2019ll save you a lot of pain when you get into a relationship in the future. You need to communicate your feelings in a reasonable time frame and be honest. Not lash out when you see an opportunity for an obvious response.", "I would also love it if my family would become more adept at telepathy.

No.  \n\nBut YTA because of how you went about expressing that.", "YTA, your dad is right. Your stepmom put time and effort into these parties for *years*, and you took a giant shit on it because \u201cshe should know\u201d that you were taking all her work for granted, and that her efforts were resented?

You were given a party that you didn't want and never asked what you actually wanted. Giving the \"kinda lame\" feedback just a few days before the event wasn't the best approach, but not TA territory when your family is so out of step with you to not realize that the tea party is for her and not for you.\n\nI (51F) also shared a birthday with my dad. We'd have a small family gathering each year. Occasionally, I'd get a separate party with friends, but that wasn't always affordable. My mom made sure that the family party was always something that both my dad and I liked, though. Your combined celebration could be good if the planning was more thoughtful (i.e., not a tea party). Now that my dad is gone, I miss celebrating with him.", "I agree", "Yes, and it's just like a tea party; we get sandwiches, meat pie, pastries, scones, the birthday cake (of course)... and all kinds of tea, and some other beverages (but I can't drink alcohol when I'm with family)", "Now that would be lame.\n\nYou're describing a 6 year old's tea party with dolls, stuffed animals and punch instead of tea.\n\nAn actual tea party is a lot of work. Tea, many dishes which typically fall into an appetizers, sandwiches, scones / crumpets (with butter, clotted cream, jellies, jams, preserves), desserts pattern, and even alcoholic drinks. All beautifully presented with china, crystal, silver on a lovely table setting.", "Really? Come on!  I am an older woman, and I know that a tea party for a 16-year-old boy is not only lame, but downright embarrassing. It's not like he used profanity. \n\n The father is an A hole because he should have shut this whole thing down when the stepmom first came up with this idiotic idea.  He didn't because he knows tea parties are his wife's thing and he didn't want to upset her.  The stepmother is also an A hole, because she never asked the kid how he wanted to celebrate his birthday, she chose something she enjoyed.     People say it's the thought that counts.  However, if you are not thinking about what the recipient would like and enjoys then there is no thought there.   NTA", ">I would also love it if my family would become more adept at telepathy.\n\nLOL\n\nThe stepmother arranges every birthday party without asking for input from OP.\n\nDon't you think she should stop pretending to have telepathy?\n\nSince the birthday has nothing to do with her, don't you think she should ask OP what he wants instead?\n\nTelepathy works both ways.\n\n>But YTA because of how you went about expressing that.\n\nBecause he called it lame?\n\nHow would you express it? I want to know.", "Agreed. Wanting a birthday party that suits your tastes and age? Not a problem - you absolutely deserve that.

Nah. I'm 3 times your age and wouldn't like that.", "And what part of that seems appealing to 16 years old boys?  None of it. \n\nStep mom wants to host a tea party.

Shocking that it is controversial to encourage communication.  \n\nI agreed he had the right to ask for something else.

You simply asked how I would say it and I responded.  \n\nLook - I\u2019ve got children and stepchildren.  I do a lot for all of them and happily so.  I do it because I love them and love seeing them happy.  And I objectively don\u2019t get it right all the time.  A parent should apologize when they mess up just as we teach our children to do.  They aren\u2019t perfect and I\u2019m not but we all love each other and aim to do the best we can.  \n\nHowever, if I am frustrated I do my best to speak to them calmly and thoughtfully and they try to do the same.  If I mess it I hope they take me aside and say \u201chey you are missing the mark here.\u201d  And they do.  \n\nMy kids get to pick their birthdays.  I\u2019m not defending her birthday choices.  I\u2019m saying a healthy family encourages healthy communication.  \n\nHe doesn\u2019t seem to hate the stepmother - he just wants his own birthday party. That\u2019s fair.  You seem to not want to acknowledge people can make bad choices unintentionally.  Communicate that thoughtfully is my point.  \n\nI accept you have a different opinion.  He isn\u2019t a toddler.

Asking what the birthday person wants seems like an obvious first step.\n\nSecond, outside of formally catered events for fund raisers and the like I have never, ever heard of someone doing this level of prep. It usually is a kettle and some prepackaged goods from a shop.
