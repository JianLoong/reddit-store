We'd have a small family gathering each year. Occasionally, I'd get a separate party with friends, but that wasn't always affordable.

I am an older woman, and I know that a tea party for a 16-year-old boy is not only lame, but downright embarrassing.

He didn't because he knows tea parties are his wife's thing and he didn't want to upset her.  The stepmother is also an A hole, because she never asked the kid how he wanted to celebrate his birthday, she chose something she enjoyed.     People say it's the thought that counts.

But it's been like this for a few years now and you haven't brought it up so how were they to know? Sure 'everyone' knows a teen wouldn't really be down for it, but again- it's been years, maybe they figured you liked it? You should probably have been a bit more eloquent, like 'hey I appreciate it and I'll definitely be here to celebrate dad's part of the birthday, but I'm not really into these parties I'd like to do something fun with my friends! Can we arrange that too?' It wouldn't have killed you to not just insult the effort, even if it may be a tad misguided.", "YTA for not saying sooner that you aren't happy with the arrangement. A full tea is a really good time to spend just hanging around the house with friends and family. You get legitimate food and more than just tea to drink. You're 16, and you have a long life ahead of you to drink. Spend the time at the tea party, then go do something more adventurous with friends.", "NAH. The tea party is lame but as a matter of common courtesy you should have told them in advance that you didn\u2019t want to participate.
