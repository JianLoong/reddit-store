But everyone needs their own personal space. It would be bad enough if Sam only had to tolerate a clingy friend at school, but having someone that you cannot avoid even after you get home would grate on anyone eventually. Your youngest just needs to understand that everyone needs a break now and then; even from friends and family.", "NTA. And you should consider putting your youngest into therapy to figure out why she's doing what she's doing, and how to start creating a personality of her own. Therapy is great, and everyone should do it, and it would probably really help here.", "NTA - part of your role as parent is to teach children (who are semi socialised beings) how to relate well to other people.  Getting into adulthood without such skills would be a very bad thing.  Explaining to her that her behaviour is getting her sister\u2019s back up is the right thing to do.", "I read few horror stories about siblings so obsessed with copying the lifestyle of their own siblings which lead to families just breaking apart . \nI think you need to put your youngest in therapy because she is doing stuff for attention . \nThe longer you allow her to act this way , the stronger the resentment will build within your oldest and one fine day it will be a massive war . \nIt's gonna be a massive problem because your youngest has no personality of her own , no Interest of her own , she is not her own person in a way and that's gonna breed inferiority real bad . \nYta for allowing this shit to happen for so long", "NTA - and I would get therapy for the younger and put a note in with the school that she\u2019s not allowed to take the same class as the older. Is it Sam\u2019s last year? Is there an option to graduate early and go to college early?", "NTA  Time for youngest to get therapy!", "NTA but this should have been address a long time ago.  Your youngest needs to be encouraged to be her own person not a copy of her big sis.  You also should step in at school and make sure they never have classes together.\n\nI have twins and faced this problem.  In 6th grade, I actually sent 1 twin to a different school because that twin couldn\u2019t disconnect.  That was the beginning of them forming their own personalities.  (It was only for that one year).  After that we spoke to schools and made sure they didn\u2019t share classes.  We also made sure they didn\u2019t work at the same place, didn\u2019t join the same sports teams, didn\u2019t do the same clubs\u2026 etc.  We had to make a pretty hard line in order to get the problem twin to create a separate personality.  They are adults now and doing great but it was rough for a while.\n\nAll that said, start separating your kids now.  Start w/ school as a new term is about to begin and I would put my younger daughter in therapy if I were you.", "INFO:\n\nHow old is your youngest?\n\nHow is it that your youngest is in a class with Sam, when there is three years age difference?

That's not how you teach your children how to go about in life.", "INFO\u2014what are the ages? I think that you need to talk to both your children separately. Your younger daughter tries to copy Sam likely because she views her as a role model and wants to be like her. My sister and I are three and a half years apart and I recall wanting to be like her when I was in elementary school. This is the case for many younger siblings. They see their older siblings the most and what they do, how they dress and act all influences them and they want to be the same way. Eventually, as they start to grow up, find their own hobbies, meet new people and etc., they begin to find their own style and personality. You should explain to your youngest that you know how much she likes Sam and wants to have a relationship with her, but she also needs some space and has to try to make her own friends and find new hobbies. Emphasize how spending time apart is equally as important as spending time together. That if she spends some time with other friends at school, then the time she has with her sister at home will be more enjoyable and that Sam would also be more interested. At the same time, you need to talk to Sam and help her understand the reason why her younger sister is doing this is because she sees her as a role model and wants a relationship with her. I think the best way to handle this situation is to find some middle ground to work with and have them both compromise. It can be as simple as your younger daughter not speaking to or bothering Sam at school, but every weekend, Sam and her sister spend two or three hours together watching a movie or maybe starting a new TV show together just one for them to watch together and an episode a week. Two hours a week should be manageable for Sam and who knows, maybe she\u2019ll start to enjoy her younger sister\u2019s presence more and their time spent together will increase. As for Sam\u2019s sister, I am confident she will appreciate spending even two hours a week with Sam where she is interested in hanging out instead of forcibly hanging out with her and seeing her be annoyed or upset.", "Is there a reason she wants to be like her older sister? Do you think that she knows you prefer her sister so is sub-consciously acting like her to get your attention and love? I mean you cant even be bothered to come up with a name for her. I think your younger daughter is in need of some understanding and perhaps you all need some family counselling. YTA", "YTA I cannot imagine allowing my older daughter to act with so much contempt to her sister. She doesn\u2019t have to be best friends with her but she needs to be kind and friendly.", "This is what teens do, they copy older sibling\u2019s behavior. Instead of constantly telling \u201cyoungest\u201d (you didn\u2019t even bother coming up with a name for her?) that she shouldn\u2019t exhibit perfectly normal behavior, maybe you could dial that back to 50%, and use the other 50% to explain to Sam to accept this is what younger siblings do. That if she had an older sister, she would have done the exact same thing. That it\u2019s annoying, but pushing her away and avoiding her in the house only makes it worse. You\u2019ve now made it a one child problem, instead of a family problem. YTA.", "YTA. OP grow up. You should have been curating your youngest daughter's individuality instead of telling her the blatant truth. Siblings annoy the hell out of one another, but you rather would have been messy and you are the MOTHER. Where were you when school electives were being chosen, during extracurricular selection time, have you helped your daughter build her social circle, and encouraged her to go out more with friends? Usually, once the children finish high school and become adults they build their special relationship. Good luck with that now and Sam and you should not be surprised when the little one does not want a relationship with her anymore and doesn\u2019t support her sister in her time of need. The both of you also better not pull the sister card either when that time comes. Due to the lack of appropriate communication and involvement on your end, the outcome is what it is now. These are your daughters, not your friends. Do better.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Is she perhaps not as social as the older one?", "I agree. I wasn\u2019t sure until I heard the ages. I used to copy my sister who was three and a half years older when I was around 7-9 years old because I looked up to her and thought she was cool and wanted to be like her. But at 14 years old, that\u2019s in high school and I had developed my own style long before then and I would usually refrain from buying the same outfits as my sister.  I can\u2019t imagine wanting to copy her, be in the same classes and hang out with her in high school. We always had our own friend groups. I think therapy is the correct suggestion. A therapist will be able to pinpoint the exact motivation behind all of this and address it appropriately. Family therapy would be even better if you can afford that.", "It\u2019s perfectly normal for 14. My sis was 19 when I was 14 and we copied off each other. I copied of popular girls that were 16.

My best friend and I bought the same dang clothes at that age.  At near 60 we don't even agree politically.  People outgrow this phase", "You think it's insanely unfair to ask the older daughter to spend an hour or two a week with her sister? I'm not talking about parentification here - this is a very minimal effort that might solve a larger issue.\n\n This whole issue may have begun because the older sister spent zero time with the younger, and the younger kept doubling down and pursuing more because she was so desperate for love from her sister. \n\nI understand kids needing their own lives, and not expecting older kids to let younger ones join their friend groups, etc, but doesn't anybody find it odd that the older sister has completely cut the younger one out of her life altogether, and for such a long time?"]}
