In 6th grade, I actually sent 1 twin to a different school because that twin couldn\u2019t disconnect.  That was the beginning of them forming their own personalities.

That's not how you teach your children how to go about in life.", "INFO\u2014what are the ages? I think that you need to talk to both your children separately. Your younger daughter tries to copy Sam likely because she views her as a role model and wants to be like her. My sister and I are three and a half years apart and I recall wanting to be like her when I was in elementary school. This is the case for many younger siblings. They see their older siblings the most and what they do, how they dress and act all influences them and they want to be the same way. Eventually, as they start to grow up, find their own hobbies, meet new people and etc., they begin to find their own style and personality. You should explain to your youngest that you know how much she likes Sam and wants to have a relationship with her, but she also needs some space and has to try to make her own friends and find new hobbies. Emphasize how spending time apart is equally as important as spending time together. That if she spends some time with other friends at school, then the time she has with her sister at home will be more enjoyable and that Sam would also be more interested. At the same time, you need to talk to Sam and help her understand the reason why her younger sister is doing this is because she sees her as a role model and wants a relationship with her. I think the best way to handle this situation is to find some middle ground to work with and have them both compromise. It can be as simple as your younger daughter not speaking to or bothering Sam at school, but every weekend, Sam and her sister spend two or three hours together watching a movie or maybe starting a new TV show together just one for them to watch together and an episode a week. Two hours a week should be manageable for Sam and who knows, maybe she\u2019ll start to enjoy her younger sister\u2019s presence more and their time spent together will increase. As for Sam\u2019s sister, I am confident she will appreciate spending even two hours a week with Sam where she is interested in hanging out instead of forcibly hanging out with her and seeing her be annoyed or upset.", "Is there a reason she wants to be like her older sister? Do you think that she knows you prefer her sister so is sub-consciously acting like her to get your attention and love? I mean you cant even be bothered to come up with a name for her. I think your younger daughter is in need of some understanding and perhaps you all need some family counselling.

Instead of constantly telling \u201cyoungest\u201d (you didn\u2019t even bother coming up with a name for her?) that she shouldn\u2019t exhibit perfectly normal behavior, maybe you could dial that back to 50%, and use the other 50% to explain to Sam to accept this is what younger siblings do. That if she had an older sister, she would have done the exact same thing. That it\u2019s annoying, but pushing her away and avoiding her in the house only makes it worse. You\u2019ve now made it a one child problem, instead of a family problem. YTA.", "YTA. OP grow up. You should have been curating your youngest daughter's individuality instead of telling her the blatant truth. Siblings annoy the hell out of one another, but you rather would have been messy and you are the MOTHER. Where were you when school electives were being chosen, during extracurricular selection time, have you helped your daughter build her social circle, and encouraged her to go out more with friends? Usually, once the children finish high school and become adults they build their special relationship. Good luck with that now and Sam and you should not be surprised when the little one does not want a relationship with her anymore and doesn\u2019t support her sister in her time of need. The both of you also better not pull the sister card either when that time comes. Due to the lack of appropriate communication and involvement on your end, the outcome is what it is now.

This means too, to take care of her, talk to her - ask her what does she like and encourage this development - stand by her side. \n\nI would  tell her it's ok to admire the bigger sister, at the same time tell the younger one what is she doing great. You could  encourage her to be more... whatever  is typically  her ... be more (e.g).creative and pay attention when she brings something self made.\n\nAll who said therapy  are not wrong, but a family therapy  is more needed here - you both as parents were not able to help the younger to develop and as parents you guide your kid. All what U do also unconscious is forming  your kids personality and even when she is going to the therapy  and changes  her behaviour, the relationship between you all is still Influenced by you both as parents and will be disabled to stay stable. Sometimes to have the opportunity to bring the oldest sister to the therapist too is also helpful, to develop the relationship between sisters. \n\nBest wishes!", "NTA\n\n14yo is plenty old enough to hear the reason.\n\nAsk your husband if you should follow him around all day copying him, both at home and at work.  Would be cute for maybe a couple days at most, then he'd be trying to shove you off and avoid you too.", "NTA\n\n1. Therapy for the youngest.\n2. Get the youngest in extracurriculars and classes that her sister doesn't like. Get her into art, dancing, swimming, anything that gives them both time apart. \n\nI would wager her selfesteem and self image are a bit skewered, so she needs to get out of her comfort zone a little, experiment things away from her sister.\n\n3. Camp! The oldest can go a weekend away with friends or at grandparens' house if you think she's too young to go alone. Same for the ypungest - send her on a school camp or grandparents.", "I\u2019m really not sure how you (and your husband) let it happen. \n\nYou should have been actively discouraging your younger kid - for years - to copy/shadow her sister before it became such an issue. \n\nThis type of thing doesn\u2019t happen overnight.", "It also tends to be cuter the bigger the age difference you have with the kid in question.", "I have a sister who is one year older than me. My parents adore her, but she consistently copies me, from my dress style to my behavior. She doesn't want her friends talking to me because she fears I'm more friendly. If someone compliments my outfit, she'll wear the same one the next day. She's spread false rumors about me to her friends, and it's frustrating to discover untrue things said about me. This annoys me alot eventhough i haven't told anything to my parents or asked to my sister about this.", "Thank you for being attentive and loving parents.", "This is it. Your child cannot hear feedback from you, it's not working, and she won't listen to her sister. Identity issues during puberty are standard but not having a sense of self is hindering her. She needs help, OP, and you're not in a position to give it to her.\n\nThis is absolutely the time to address her unstable sense of self.

I missed that. \ud83d\udc40", "Sam 2.0 doesn\u2019t need an introduction.", "That's because she actively avoids having one lol", "I got called \"[redacted]'s sister\" so many times that I once introduced myself that way.. leading my sister to give me the most withering look as she said \"You. Have. A. NAME.\"", "Yup. And the way she finally handled it was so the AH. Sounds super demeaning, not helpful, and honestly shows that OP doesn\u2019t seem to like her much.", "Ooooh maybe? It is weird that there\u2019s no name given for the youngest- like Ai picks up that people usually say \u201cwe\u2019ll call them\u2026\u201d but wasn\u2019t smart enough to see it needed to happen twice? I really don\u2019t know but super curious what makes you suspect it!", "No, AI would have much better grammar", "Finally I see a comment that thinks about the other kid's feelings too.", "agreed. i feel like the poor girl is copying her sister in hopes of her mother loving her as much as she does sam. or maybe she\u2019s fighting for a bond with sam as she doesn\u2019t have much of one with her mom", "The fact that \"Sam\" gets a name but \"Youngest\" doesn't says a lot.", "I have seen this happen with siblings. One loves their sibling so much that they want to be just like them (because they're a kid), & the other sibling treats them like they're nothing but a nuisance (probably because they've been pissed since the sibling was born in the first place and they're no longer the only child , or baby of the family ). Then they have basically a non-existent relationship as adults which I think is so sad to see with siblings .", "Not sure why you\u2019re getting downvoted. This was my take exactly. Mom clearly favors Sam.", "Excellent point! I'm 5 years younger than my half-sister and basically worshipped her. She lived primarily with her mom but spent vacations with us. I looked up to her so much and absolutely copied her interests. However, she didn't have to deal with me imitating her every day. Instead, she got to enjoy me choosing to play the same musical instrument and taking the same foreign language as her.", "To this degree though?", "Because most people need therapy.", "The people who don't need therapy aren't in the position of having such serious problems that they need to post on Reddit. The ones posting here are the segment of the population that would most benefit from therapy.", "IMHO, I think it's mostly people on reddit who think other people on reddit should go for therapy. It's likely to do with them feeling they have no one else to talk to and so other people are in the same position as them. \n\nIt's the same situation for most other social media. People vent online because they have no one to talk to or they need validation. So it's assumed that they have no other support or outlet and therapy is the only way to get it irl. \n\nPeople who are grounded and have good support and open communication with others around them won't come on reddit and ask AITA of strangers who don't know them or their real life situations.", "Yeah, there was a post here a few years back with two sisters like this, the younger constantly copied the older sister's haircuts. The oldest eventually had enough of it, and bought wig that was a different color and significantly shorter, and she put it on while she facetimed her younger sister. Next time she saw her, her younger sister had cut and dyed her hair to match her older sister, who completely freaked out when she realized that she'd been tricked. I believe the older sister was found to be NTA.", "Or a post from the older sister how the younger keeps trying to steal her boyfriend/husband.

You need to discuss this with the guidance counselor or whoever does the scheduling.", "Can you at least give your youngest a fake name?  \"Sam vs Youngest\" says a lot about how you treat them, even subconsiously.", "And at this age?", "Why not? Sis pulled away--maybe she'd be closer if I was more like her. So she gets closer, and the other pulls away more, rinse, repeat.", "What are you talking about all op says is she takes the same classes and wants to be like her older sister", "Everyone can benefit from therapy.", "I remember this one! The older sister said the younger sister would gaslight her about the copying and the family would brush it off as either a compliment or coincidence until the wig stunt!\n\nYeah, copycat stuff does not end well.", "\ud83e\udd23 fair enough", "So you\u2019re just straight up victim blaming the older sister for the younger sister\u2019s harassment?\n\nOr are you \u201cjust asking questions\u201d?"]}
