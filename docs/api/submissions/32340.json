In 6th grade, I actually sent 1 twin to a different school because that twin couldn\u2019t disconnect.  That was the beginning of them forming their own personalities.

We also made sure they didn\u2019t work at the same place, didn\u2019t join the same sports teams, didn\u2019t do the same clubs\u2026 etc.  We had to make a pretty hard line in order to get the problem twin to create a separate personality.

That's not how you teach your children how to go about in life.", "INFO\u2014what are the ages? I think that you need to talk to both your children separately. Your younger daughter tries to copy Sam likely because she views her as a role model and wants to be like her. My sister and I are three and a half years apart and I recall wanting to be like her when I was in elementary school. This is the case for many younger siblings. They see their older siblings the most and what they do, how they dress and act all influences them and they want to be the same way. Eventually, as they start to grow up, find their own hobbies, meet new people and etc., they begin to find their own style and personality. You should explain to your youngest that you know how much she likes Sam and wants to have a relationship with her, but she also needs some space and has to try to make her own friends and find new hobbies. Emphasize how spending time apart is equally as important as spending time together. That if she spends some time with other friends at school, then the time she has with her sister at home will be more enjoyable and that Sam would also be more interested. At the same time, you need to talk to Sam and help her understand the reason why her younger sister is doing this is because she sees her as a role model and wants a relationship with her. I think the best way to handle this situation is to find some middle ground to work with and have them both compromise. It can be as simple as your younger daughter not speaking to or bothering Sam at school, but every weekend, Sam and her sister spend two or three hours together watching a movie or maybe starting a new TV show together just one for them to watch together and an episode a week. Two hours a week should be manageable for Sam and who knows, maybe she\u2019ll start to enjoy her younger sister\u2019s presence more and their time spent together will increase. As for Sam\u2019s sister, I am confident she will appreciate spending even two hours a week with Sam where she is interested in hanging out instead of forcibly hanging out with her and seeing her be annoyed or upset.", "Is there a reason she wants to be like her older sister? Do you think that she knows you prefer her sister so is sub-consciously acting like her to get your attention and love? I mean you cant even be bothered to come up with a name for her. I think your younger daughter is in need of some understanding and perhaps you all need some family counselling. YTA", "YTA I cannot imagine allowing my older daughter to act with so much contempt to her sister. She doesn\u2019t have to be best friends with her but she needs to be kind and friendly.", "This is what teens do, they copy older sibling\u2019s behavior. Instead of constantly telling \u201cyoungest\u201d (you didn\u2019t even bother coming up with a name for her?) that she shouldn\u2019t exhibit perfectly normal behavior, maybe you could dial that back to 50%, and use the other 50% to explain to Sam to accept this is what younger siblings do. That if she had an older sister, she would have done the exact same thing. That it\u2019s annoying, but pushing her away and avoiding her in the house only makes it worse. You\u2019ve now made it a one child problem, instead of a family problem. YTA.", "YTA. OP grow up. You should have been curating your youngest daughter's individuality instead of telling her the blatant truth. Siblings annoy the hell out of one another, but you rather would have been messy and you are the MOTHER. Where were you when school electives were being chosen, during extracurricular selection time, have you helped your daughter build her social circle, and encouraged her to go out more with friends? Usually, once the children finish high school and become adults they build their special relationship. Good luck with that now and Sam and you should not be surprised when the little one does not want a relationship with her anymore and doesn\u2019t support her sister in her time of need. The both of you also better not pull the sister card either when that time comes. Due to the lack of appropriate communication and involvement on your end, the outcome is what it is now.
