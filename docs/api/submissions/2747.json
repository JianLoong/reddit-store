We went to foster care because he could take care of us. Well after foster care he kept coming back into my life for some months then leaving again. He got arrested the day of my engagement and he called me 3 days later, he was crying asking me if he could be in my life again cuz he doesn't know what to do without me in his life. Me being naive I took him back into my life. I invited him to my wedding but with rules. He couldn't bring his girlfriend , who he says is abusive and won't leave her, he can't be on drugs, but most of all he couldn't walk me down the isle. I had already asked someone to walk me down the isle because my dad was absent for so long. He said all the rules were completely fine with him. Then he called my sister to complain. She told me he asked \"why can't I walk your sister down the isle like wtf. And why can't ***** come? \" I said you know what it's fine he's not invited I removed him from the guest list and blocked him. Now I'm starting to feel really guilty.

If you have to cut him off to be safe then do it.", "NTA.\n\n\nYou should really cut contact with your father, because it is obvious he is not respecting your wishes and is prioritizing his own vices and demons over your happiness.

It\u2019s probably best for everyone that he doesn\u2019t attend", "NTA. You un-invited him out of fear: fear that he\u2019ll be an ass at your wedding and ruin a day you can never get back.\n\nIf your guilt is really eating at you, you could sit down with him and explain this. There\u2019s no guarantee he\u2019ll understand or accept your explanation, but you could try if you think it\u2019s worth doing.", "NTA.  Your father, unfortunately, is unable to see past his own behaviors, and is doing the \u201c I am the star of the show \u201c thing again.

Then he complains about them to your sister. He\u2019s not able to be honest with you. Quite likely there would be other things he\u2019d not be honest with, or respect. Good call. Keep your life as simple as possible. Well done for setting boundaries and making sure they won\u2019t be crossed.", "NTA.  You have very good reasons for not having him there.  It's childish of him to phone your sister to complain rather than talking with you.  You had things planned already and the wedding will proceed fine without him.

He's still on drugs, is not ready to change and lied to your face.  You could keep tabs on him, be ready to help if he ever does decide to get right but at this point, no.  I'm not going to tell you not to feel bad about this, it truly sucks but sometimes, when someone becomes a threat as your dad has, you have simply must either cut that person loose or see your own life destroyed.", "I think maybe YTA partially.\n\nYour dad has a right to his own feelings. He *has* to know the impact his behavior and addictions have had on you and I am sure it is likely difficult for him to face the implications of his past. But the fact that he complained and vented to your sister does not necessarily mean he would not abide by the rules you laid out. Telling you it\u2019s fine and that he will follow the rules doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he won\u2019t feel how he feels and may not need or wish to talk through it with others.\n\nWhether or not I think you may be TA for making the decision based on his conversation with your sister, I think you are definitely NTA at all for treading carefully and setting boundaries. And you are definitely NTA for feeling as you do.\n\nSounds to me like you are unsettled about the situation with him overall and this is a symptom of it. \n\nI hope you can get to a more definitive, less stressful place with him whether it is in your life or not, and to what degree. \nOtherwise I wonder if you may be stressed if he comes and also stressed if he doesn\u2019t come. I hope you can get out from under that so you can focus on, and enjoy, your day.", "nTa", "NTA The drama and stress will be never ending, never stop and when you have kids he will be walking in and out of their lives too. Sometimes it is just better to make a clean cut. You will find you can heal better after that.", "Yes YTA because you uninvited him without him breaking any of the rules, or telling you he would, and you didn\u2019t even bother to talk to him about it and confront him. \nI\u2019d get it if you didn\u2019t invite him at all - after that history, who could blame you!? But you\u2019re not sticking to boundaries you set and it sounds like you\u2019re looking for an excuse to cut him off. And you don\u2019t really need one - just own up to it!", "Yea... I'm glad I'm not the only one that thought this. So no one is allowed to vent anymore? Plus he was asking questions, not just saying like oh she's wrong because of xyz. \n\nIf you wanted to not invite him because of his previous issues, that's valid, but to uninvite him because he asked questions to someone else is definitely AH territory.", "He went behind my back after telling me all the terms were fine. I apologize you see I'm the ah.", "No, the problem is he told me that all those rules were fine. He excepted the terms I came to because he was an absent father. But then went and complained to my sister about it all. Why not just tell me the truth yk? Idk..", "You don\u2019t need to apologise to me :-) you asked the world so you got various opinions!", "So if he had expressed concerns to you, wouldn't the end result be the same in your eyes? That you would've uninvited him? Because that just means you didn't really want him there anyways. He's trying to not cause drama by complaining to you and I'd venting to someone else instead.\n\nEdit: how do you know EXACTLY that he was complaining? Because it sounds like he was asking questions. Maybe he truly doesn't understand why you've set those (very valid) rules.", "People need to vent sometimes. He agreed to your conditions. Feel like your being petty just because.", "I would've talk to him if he came to me. I would've listened to him but he told me all the terms were fine what am I supposed to do read his mind. If he doesn't say it then I won't know.", "I get that.  I just added this in an edit,  but he was asking questions.  Maybe he truly doesn't understand.  But if the real issue isn't him complaining, it's just that he didn't complain to you, then tell him that. You're not being honest here, either. Some people truly think that saying nothing is keeping the peace. If you need a different level of communication, express that. Hebcant read your mind either"]}
