My sister and I have always been close growing up, she\u2019s probably one of my best friends. I was one of the first people that she told that she\u2019s getting married, she asked me to be her best man and I enthusiastically agreed. \n\nThings were going great until her engagement party this weekend. The plan was brunch at 10:30 and then to go to my sisters place and chill. It worked since it was only 5 people, it was less of an engagement party and more of a casual get together. \n\nNow, I\u2019m someone who loves to sleep, especially on the weekends. I\u2019m a bit of a workaholic and tend to be the last one out of the office, first one in. I\u2019m married to my job.\n\nMy sister knows this about me, and she knows that I have a big project coming up. So on Friday I was at the office until 9, and didn\u2019t get home until 10. I passed out and slept through my alarms. I woke up at 11, by the time I rolled out of bed I had already missed brunch. I texted my sister telling her I\u2019d be late and show up to her apartment. I arrived and she seemed annoyed but didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nAfter everyone else had left she asked me if there was anything else I wanted to tell her, and I said no. She sighed and asked me to leave. Today I woke up to a text saying that she no longer wants me in her wedding party, I asked her why and she told me it\u2019s because I\u2019m always late to everything and don\u2019t make her a priority (not true). I tried to argue but she completely shut down the conversation. I told her that if I\u2019m no longer in the party I\u2019m not going to the wedding and she just reacted with a \u201cthumbs up.\u201d \n\nMy girlfriend thinks I\u2019m an asshole and should apologize but I don\u2019t see why.

Wedding are tightly scheduled, you can't just delay it because the best man slept through his alarm.  If she can't count on you to show up on time (And plainly she can't), she shouldn't have you in her wedding party.

They're not going to feel very honored under those circumstances.  At least this way she can plan it ahead of time.\n\nEdit:  The real problem here is that as a workaholic, you'd never stroll in for a meeting an hour late with no apology.  It's not that you can't reliably be on time, it's that you only bother to do so for things that you consider important, meaning any work event, but not even the most important events in your sister's life.  How do you think that makes her feel?", "YTA - Basic manners dictate that you. as the best man, should mot be late for anything related to the wedding.

How many people have ghosted you or stopped spending time with you? Why don\u2019t you just stay home from here on out?", "YTA!! You forgot the part where you needed to apologize profusely for you missing her event. There really is no good excuse for you to have missed any part of her event.

But I still set my alarm and went in the next day.\n\nIf you can turn up to work after a day like that, you can turn up to a party where you are expected. Or at least apologise. I cant believe you never apologised for missing half the party. Of course she kicked you out of the wedding party - you've made it clear you'll probably miss  her wedding ceremony and turn up without an apology several hours later. If you want to be in the party, you need to be bloody on time at bare minimum. And you've made it clear you just can't be relied upon to take that seriously. \n\nIt sounds like you regularly flake on your sister.

No. Because it matters to you, and it\u2019s what you do to maintain employment. Other relationships are similar. \n\nYou showed your sister her place, she is simply adjusting. It wasn\u2019t just eggs and bs, it was an event to celebrate her nuptials. Willing bet a party for your project would be priority.\n\nYou place your job above all, and that includes your sister.", "YTA - you also know you're a workaholic and heavy sleeper. If going to her engagement party was important to you, you would have planned for that. As a workaholic I can only assume you aren't frequently late to work so you must have some system in place for getting there on time. The fact that you didn't use that system for her engagement party (and from what she said, several other events) shows that she isn't a priority for you.\n\nI say all that as someone with adhd who is chronically late, to everything. I was quite literally late to the birth of my child (we got held up at the store on the way to hospital to start the induction process). I still have systems in place to make sure I'm there for really important things. If your sister's wedding was a priority for you, you'd have set extra alarms or finished working earlier or even gotten out of bed faster (\"by the time I rolled out of bed I had already missed brunch\" bro brunch is not a fast meal it takes at least an hour. If you woke up at 11 you'd still have some time to get up and get there unless they ate super fast).

Then, when you are removed from the wedding party for your inability to prioritize, you get your underwear in a bunch and try to manipulate her into adding you back by threatening to skip the whole thing. Even now, you don\u2019t think that brunch was important because you don\u2019t appreciate the fact that she\u2019s upset and you\u2019ve hurt her feelings. You were removed from the wedding party because your sister doesn\u2019t want to give you another opportunity to hurt her again.

You are rude AF to expect people to work around your schedule and I can understand your sister kicking you out of her wedding party. She probably doesn\u2019t want to risk you being late to her own damn wedding because god forbid you prioritize someone else over yourself.", "YTA your sister and girlfriend are right.  I can't believe you missed almost the whole thing, showed up super late, and didn't once utter the words \"I'm sorry\", especially after your sister even prompted you to do so.  \n\nAlso your sister probably doesn't want to be standing there, waiting for you to arrive to start her wedding.  She's spent a lifetime waiting for you, and you clearly don't prioritize her.  You were home at 10 pm, and couldn't make it to a 10:30 am brunch?", "YTA. Just because she knows your bad qualities doesn\u2019t mean she has to deal with them. Grow up", "YTA. \n\nMy boyfriend has a similar issue of sleeping through events and thinking it\u2019s ok (he\u2019s working to change this habit). Newsflash it\u2019s not and it\u2019s not something people have to tolerate from you. People don\u2019t care about the reason you overslept, they only care about you missing a large chunk of special event without any notice that you\u2019d be late. I hope that you make it right with your sister and that you work on your behavior. \n\nJust a heads up about your girlfriend, she\u2019s closely observing your behavior with your sister, who you claim is one of your best friends. If you\u2019ll disregard your sister\u2019s feelings, she can see how you\u2019d disregard hers as well. I know from experience.", "I would be so hurt if someone I loved treated me like how you\u2019re treating her. YTA.", "YTA you threw a childlike tantrum and tried to blackmail her by saying you aren\u2019t going to the wedding at all if you don\u2019t get your way. Your excuses for being late aren\u2019t good enough. She wants someone who cares enough to not miss the party. That ain\u2019t you", "INFO: Did you even apologize for being late to the party?", "YTA. So you're super close and best friends, but you basically did a no show with no communication, then when called on it doubled down. Then when she gave you reasons why you are not in the wedding party anymore you tripled down by saying you weren't coming at all. Wow. And that's how you treat someone you're super close to.", "Apologizing for being late is a default setting in basic human decency.  The fact that you\u2019re fighting so hard against such a simple, easy, thing to do tells me everything about what your sister has been putting up with her whole life.", "My soon-to-be-ex-girlfriend\\*", "I\u2019m surprised he even has a girlfriend. If he\u2019s \u201cmarried to his job\u201d wouldn\u2019t that be considered cheating?", "I\u2019m not keen on mimosas and don\u2019t eat eggs Benedict, but I would certainly show up on time for brunch because that is what people do when they love somebody. You just don\u2019t tell a person you love them, you show them you love them by prioritizing them. \n\nYou sound like an educated person and I find it incomprehensible that you must ask strangers on the internet if you are the asshole. Really?! You are so self absorbed that you can\u2019t even see how much you hurt your sister. You have absolutely no common sense.", "> Did you call her when you wake up to make clear you missed it but you are sorry?\n\nHe never apologized. Even when his sister asked him if he had anything to say about missing it. Had he apologized, she probably wouldn't have kicked him out of the wedding party, but he's made it clear he doesn't feel bad about this at all.", "Successful at what? Your job? Because you aren\u2019t super successful at life.", "Your success at your job is not a reflection of you being a successful person. YTA. Work is work. Work is not life. No one is impressed.", "Just like your sister said,  she's not a priority for you at all. You would never think of sleeping in and being late for work.  When something is important to you, or to someone that is important to you, you make sure you're on time and when you're not you apologize. It doesn't even sound like you gave a half assed \"sorry I'm late\" when you walked in the door. Yta", "I hope that your job comforts you when nobody wants you around because you can respect your job but can't respect the people around you for anything. Your attitude is gross. Your sister wanted you to show her she was a priority, amd instead you reduced it to \"mimosas and eggs benedict\" instead of her wanting to be surrounded by people she loved. Complete asshole and I think you might be single soon too, because I could never see any woman staying with a man like you after an incident like this.", "It\u2019s so blatantly obvious that I don\u2019t understand why you cannot see\u2026you are successfully at your job on time, and give it your all. That\u2019s great. And everyone else in your life takes a back seat to this, no exceptions.\n\nThis event was extra important. You still feel it wasn\u2019t important enough for you to make adjustments to your routine. It was second place, (or third, or fourth) after work and sleep, so your sister decided that she didn\u2019t want someone who couldn\u2019t give it as much consideration as they would a Zoom call about a PowerPoint. Or a dentist appointment. Or anything else you make adjustments to your life to do.\n\nYou can have your priorities, but she has a right to hers, too. If you don\u2019t feel she should be upset at you for holding to your standards, why should you be upset at her for holding to hers?", "[removed]", "Then why couldnt you be bothered to wake up for this?", "Less successful at making the people in your life feel valued and appreciated, though.  See if your job will be there for you when you need emotional support.", "Successful at your work but a failure at being a good person your sister can depend on. Guess we see where your priorities are", "Not successful at life", "You just lost your sister because you are not only an AH, you\u2019re stubborn. So we\u2019re you going to sleep through her wedding and the be like what\u2019s the big deal? Gosh you are a huge jerk. YTA", "And your sister is afraid that later you\u2019ll be saying \u2018I didn\u2019t sleep through the whole wedding.  I got there in time to see the officiant pronounce them married.  I just missed the procession and the vows and exchange of rings.\u2019\n\nYTA.", "There are alarms that run away from you. There are alarms that flash and buzz. One can have multiple alarms, some across the room.\n\nYTA OP for not having a setup that will actually wake you up when needed. Not having that is just selfcentered.", "The thing is that as corporate law attorney, I\u2019ve worked till 2-3 am and still showed up for friends\u2019 events at 11 am the next day. One day of less sleep isn\u2019t going to kill anyone. OP could\u2019ve easily made it to brunch but he just doesn\u2019t care to.", "One of my sibling's wedding party members, who was always a flake, didn't bother to make it to the rehearsal or the dinner the night before, without even so much as a text.  We were all shocked he actually showed up to the wedding.", "It's crazy how many times I see men feeling the need to make up a fictional woman to hate whenever they're confronted with a fellow man doing something wrong", "THIS! Well done putting it in terms that OP might have a glimmer of hope of understanding.   Hopefully he can get it through his thick skull. \n\nFYI, OP: YTA.
