My sister and I have always been close growing up, she\u2019s probably one of my best friends. I was one of the first people that she told that she\u2019s getting married, she asked me to be her best man and I enthusiastically agreed. \n\nThings were going great until her engagement party this weekend. The plan was brunch at 10:30 and then to go to my sisters place and chill. It worked since it was only 5 people, it was less of an engagement party and more of a casual get together. \n\nNow, I\u2019m someone who loves to sleep, especially on the weekends. I\u2019m a bit of a workaholic and tend to be the last one out of the office, first one in. I\u2019m married to my job.\n\nMy sister knows this about me, and she knows that I have a big project coming up. So on Friday I was at the office until 9, and didn\u2019t get home until 10. I passed out and slept through my alarms. I woke up at 11, by the time I rolled out of bed I had already missed brunch. I texted my sister telling her I\u2019d be late and show up to her apartment. I arrived and she seemed annoyed but didn\u2019t say anything. \n\nAfter everyone else had left she asked me if there was anything else I wanted to tell her, and I said no. She sighed and asked me to leave. Today I woke up to a text saying that she no longer wants me in her wedding party, I asked her why and she told me it\u2019s because I\u2019m always late to everything and don\u2019t make her a priority (not true). I tried to argue but she completely shut down the conversation. I told her that if I\u2019m no longer in the party I\u2019m not going to the wedding and she just reacted with a \u201cthumbs up.\u201d \n\nMy girlfriend thinks I\u2019m an asshole and should apologize but I don\u2019t see why.

Wedding are tightly scheduled, you can't just delay it because the best man slept through his alarm.  If she can't count on you to show up on time (And plainly she can't), she shouldn't have you in her wedding party.

They're not going to feel very honored under those circumstances.  At least this way she can plan it ahead of time.\n\nEdit:  The real problem here is that as a workaholic, you'd never stroll in for a meeting an hour late with no apology.  It's not that you can't reliably be on time, it's that you only bother to do so for things that you consider important, meaning any work event, but not even the most important events in your sister's life.  How do you think that makes her feel?", "YTA - Basic manners dictate that you. as the best man, should mot be late for anything related to the wedding.

There are so many reasons people are chronically late, but in most cases it\u2019s simple: because they don\u2019t want to be on time. You clearly had no interest in being on time.

How many people have ghosted you or stopped spending time with you? Why don\u2019t you just stay home from here on out?", "YTA!! You forgot the part where you needed to apologize profusely for you missing her event. There really is no good excuse for you to have missed any part of her event.

But I still set my alarm and went in the next day.\n\nIf you can turn up to work after a day like that, you can turn up to a party where you are expected. Or at least apologise. I cant believe you never apologised for missing half the party. Of course she kicked you out of the wedding party - you've made it clear you'll probably miss  her wedding ceremony and turn up without an apology several hours later. If you want to be in the party, you need to be bloody on time at bare minimum. And you've made it clear you just can't be relied upon to take that seriously. \n\nIt sounds like you regularly flake on your sister.

No. Because it matters to you, and it\u2019s what you do to maintain employment. Other relationships are similar. \n\nYou showed your sister her place, she is simply adjusting. It wasn\u2019t just eggs and bs, it was an event to celebrate her nuptials. Willing bet a party for your project would be priority.\n\nYou place your job above all, and that includes your sister.", "YTA - you also know you're a workaholic and heavy sleeper. If going to her engagement party was important to you, you would have planned for that. As a workaholic I can only assume you aren't frequently late to work so you must have some system in place for getting there on time. The fact that you didn't use that system for her engagement party (and from what she said, several other events) shows that she isn't a priority for you.\n\nI say all that as someone with adhd who is chronically late, to everything. I was quite literally late to the birth of my child (we got held up at the store on the way to hospital to start the induction process). I still have systems in place to make sure I'm there for really important things. If your sister's wedding was a priority for you, you'd have set extra alarms or finished working earlier or even gotten out of bed faster (\"by the time I rolled out of bed I had already missed brunch\" bro brunch is not a fast meal it takes at least an hour. If you woke up at 11 you'd still have some time to get up and get there unless they ate super fast).

Then, when you are removed from the wedding party for your inability to prioritize, you get your underwear in a bunch and try to manipulate her into adding you back by threatening to skip the whole thing. Even now, you don\u2019t think that brunch was important because you don\u2019t appreciate the fact that she\u2019s upset and you\u2019ve hurt her feelings. You were removed from the wedding party because your sister doesn\u2019t want to give you another opportunity to hurt her again.

If you still care about your family's opinion, maybe listen to the thousands of people trying to help you not ruin this forever.", "Np", "The way OP wrote the post, I wouldn\u2019t be shocked if he secretly didn\u2019t set an alarm and just decided ahead of time that he\u2019d show up when he felt like it.", "I like this analogy (metaphor? Simile? Comparison?)  Put it in work terms, which he apparently understands.", "But work directly affects his life, thus it's important. The brunch was about someone else, thus not important. Don't you get it?!? s/ OP is a clown, and a selfish one at that.", ">Are you going to say the same thing when you miss her wedding ceremony and just show up for the reception? YTA.\n\nOP will \"just\" miss the whole morning of wedding prep and photos, then claim that having gotten there 3 minutes before the procession means he didn't miss anything important.", "This. \n\nYou are more than able to make sure you are up early to proudly be the first person into work during the week. You could have absolutely done the same thing on the weekend for your sister if it was important enough to you.  It wasn\u2019t even that early, you still could have gotten 10+ hrs of sleep. \n\nYTA. Huge asshole. Apologize to your sister while you can, and make a better effort to prioritize the people (particularly the women) in your life who care about you. Your sister and your gf are on to your BS.", ">Your job doesn't love you. Your sister does.\n\nShe probably loves him a little less right now when he's shown her that she's not a priority to him and followed it up with his little \"I won't bother to attend if I'm not being recognized as best man\".", "Can confirm, I'm one of them. O. My days off when I have no commitments, you bet your ass I sleep for 12h straight...but NOT if I have somewhere to be, esp somewhere that important.", "He\u2019s probably late to date nights because work is too important and he\u2019s too successful to honor other people\u2019s time", "He did", ">I woke up at 11, by the time I rolled out of bed I had already missed brunch.\n\nAre we reading the same post?", "\u201cMy girlfriend thinks I\u2019m the asshole and should apologize but I don\u2019t see why\u201d is a pretty clear indication that OP doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s in the wrong. Combined with the sister asking him if he had anything to say (aka giving him space to apologize) and him not saying anything, I have a hard time believing that he did.\n\nIn the event that OP did profusely apologize in text form, he still should have said something in person. Texts don\u2019t hold the same weight as a personal apology.", "Looks like OP has a second account. You are both AH\u2019s. Make a mistake, say sorry. And who the hell needs 12 hours of sleep? Jeez, and he/you are doing office work. You\u2019re not slaving in the fields or a steel mill. Putz\u2026both of you or just you."]}
