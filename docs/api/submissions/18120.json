{"id": 18120, "submission_id": "13ravnr", "title": "AITA for letting my son go to Disneyland?", "selftext": "I have a 6 year old son, Jake, and we\u2019re currently staying with my brother, his wife and their daughter (Abby-17). \n\nAbby recently went through something really hard and traumatic. I feel for her with all my heart and am doing all I can to be there for her.\n\nDuring this time, Abby\u2019s become really close to Jake. It was sweet enough at first and even though Jake isn\u2019t one to sit in one place for long, he didn\u2019t say anything and allows his cousin to cuddle and spend time with him.\n\nHe does a lot for her and will wake her up when she takes naps for too long, will go out to the park with her to make sure she doesn\u2019t stay at home too long etc. My SIL was extremely appreciative of this and Abby seems to be happier when he\u2019s around. Of course, Abby is in therapy so I didn\u2019t think she was dependent on my son to get her through the day. \n\nBut a couple weeks ago, Jake\u2019s paternal grandparents wanted to take him to Disneyland for a couple days and he was so excited. He kept telling everyone how much fun he was going to have and more. Abby didn\u2019t say much whenever he\u2019d mention Disneyland but my SIL asked me if he was actually going multiple times.\n\nI said yes, why would I stop my son from going to Disneyland? She asked if his grandparents could take him on this trip another time but I told her that wouldn\u2019t be possible. She was upset but stopped.\n\nThe other day, his grandparents came to pick him up and he was sitting with Abby getting ready to go when she suddenly broke down crying. Jake got scared and started crying as well so I separated them. They calmed down and Jake left for Disneyland some time later. \n\nMy SIL was furious. She came up to me and was like \u201cso you really let him go?\u201d I said yes, again, why wouldn\u2019t I? She was all like \u201cyou saw how my daughter reacted to him leaving and you\u2019re still confused?\u201d Apparently, Abby really didn\u2019t want him to go and she cried because he was leaving. I told her that this was extremely unfair for her to say. \n\nMy SIL said that I was being unfair and that Disneyland is not more important than her daughter\u2019s well being. I never said this, but I told her that my son isn\u2019t her emotional support dog and while I\u2019m very sorry about Abby, it isn\u2019t fair to put my 6 year old son\u2019s life on pause. He\u2019s 6!!! It\u2018a unfair for her to force my son to give up things for the comfort of his cousin. \n\nSIL called me heartless and said she wants me gone from the house before Jake gets back because she isn\u2019t putting Abby through this again. My brother intervened and told her that she\u2019s acting irrationally but she told him to stfu. It\u2019s been really tense and while I did attempt to apologize, SIL told me that the only apology she\u2019d accept is one from Jake but I\u2019m not going to make him apologize so AITA? I really don\u2019t think so but Abby is genuinely upset about Jake leaving.\n\nEdit:\n\nI was repeating my SIL\u2019s words word for word but giving her the benefit of the doubt, I believe she meant that the only apology she\u2019d accept is one in the form of Jake. Not that it makes it any better, but I don\u2019t think she actually wants him to say I\u2019m sorry. But I could be wrong as well. Either way, I wasn\u2019t going to apologize the way she wants me to.\n\nEdit: \n\nI didn\u2019t mention the passing of my husband because honestly? I didn\u2019t want to mention it or talk about it. I didn\u2019t think it was relevant enough to mention. I doubted I\u2019d get this much attention and when people started asking questions I kinda realized that talking about my husband was inevitable. It\u2019s stupid, I know. But I still find it really hard to talk about and I had no clue this post was going to get as big as it did.

Everything he\u2019s done for Abby is incredible but also above and beyond, absolutely not without the realm of expectation for a 6 year old.\n\nIn general I would try to distance him from Abby a little bit, because this seems like a very unhealthy attachment that could lead to some kind of trauma in turn for your own child.", "NTA.\n\nI was feeling at least a little sympathy for your SIL throughout your story, almost enough to make me vote N-A-H, until I got to this bit: \n\n*SIL told me that the only apology she'd accept is one from Jake*\n\nShe wants an apology from a six-year-old? An apology for WHAT? For going to Disneyland with his grandparents? She thinks Jake has done something to be blamed for?\n\nIt's not even as if Jake had any choice in the matter. Six-year-olds get to choose what flavor of ice cream they want, or what sweater to wear today. They don't get to choose things on the scale of trips to Disneyland. Adults make those arrangements, and they say \"Jake, you're going to Disneyland!\" The kid's job is to jump up and down and say \"Oh, boy! When?\" and to go, and to have a great time. Jake has nothing to apologize for, and for your SIL to pretend that he does is cruel.\n\nI feel for Abby, but her mental wellbeing is neither Jake's responsibility nor yours.\n\nYou need to get out of that house and find other living arrangements as soon as you can. \n\n*I told her that my son isn't her emotional support dog.* Harsh, but accurate.", "NTA.

Be packed up and ready to go when Jake returns if at all possible.", "NTA. Your son is entitled to special experiences and special memories with his grandparents. There\u2019s no way his childhood should be put on pause for the sake of his cousin.", "NTA.  As you said, your son is not Abby's service animal. It's absolutely ridiculous for your SIL to expect your son to spend the foreseeable future crying over missing out on the opportunity to go to Disneyland with his grandparents just so that his nearly grown cousin doesn't have a meltdown. It's no wonder she's in therapy when her parents seem to be bending over backwards to give her an unrealistic existence that is entirely devoid of anxiety. You're honestly better off staying somewhere other than with your brother's crazy wife.", "NTA. As you said, your son is not your niece's emotional support animal. It's absurd for your SIL to think that she had any right to keep your son around as such. You do not owe her an apology.", "NTA. I understand that you were trying to help Abby and Jake is also helping, and it is a great thing to do. But Jake is 6 years old, and he should not be giving up his own life and enjoyment just so that Abby will not be upset. Like you said, Jake is not an emotion support dog, and it is ridiculous of your SIL to even make that sort of demands on your son.\n\nHope Jake had a great time in Disneyland, but like others say, I suggest you keep an eye on the interactions between Abby and Jake, in case they unload further emotional baggage for Jake to carry. Abby is family, but Jake is also a little boy who deserves to have a normal childhood without having to bear the emotional baggage for someone else. Leave that to the professionals.", "Lol, your SIL is the one who needs therapy and treatment. She has too many issues.", "NTA\n\nIt very much sounds like Abby is not the only one traumatised here, her mum is profoundly affected as well, to the point she's being unreasonable and thinks the world revolves around her needs. She's so blinded by the trauma and desperately wants to make thing better that she's neglecting other people's needs and rights. The fact she's demanding an apology from Jake - a 6 years old!!! - is really telling you how out of touch with reality she is at the moment. She needs healing as much as Abby does, but that's not yours and Jake's problem.\n\nYou're absolutely right that your son is not Abby's emotional support dog. His life can't stop because Abby started using him as a crutch and clinging onto him.\n\nFor all parties involved, I think it's best that you remove yourself and Jake from your SIL's house altogether and keep your distance for quite some time. Why were you staying with them in the first place, was it to support them? As sad as their situation is, you can't be dragged into other people's mess because it will start affecting your mental health. You need distance and leave Abby's family to heal in their own time.", "what the actual fuck! she can\u2019t put that kind of responsibility on a six year old, he\u2019s a CHILD!!! i feel for your niece, i do but your SIL and Abby can\u2019t rely on your son for emotional support and should be working with her therapist to find better coping mechanisms. SIL should probably start her own therapy since she wants to punish a six year old for going to disneyland. \n\nNTA and you have nothing to apologise for.", "NTA. It's insane of your SIL to expect your SIX YEAR OLD to be her child's emotional support person. It's good your brother intervened, and you have nothing to apologize for. If possible, I  think it would be better for you to live somewhere else", "You need to get out of there - this is bordering on abuse towards Jake, who should never, at 6 years old, be made to feel responsible for a much older child's mental health. \n\nHe sounds like a sweet and mature child but they're taking advantage and treating him like a service animal. I'm actually quite astounded. He didn't cause Abby's issues and he's not responsible for her recovery. You should not, at any point, consider making him apologise. Your SIL has become unhinged and using your kid to make her kid feel better. Wtf.\n\nJake going to Disneyland is the best thing that could have happened. Poor kid. Get out of there.", "NTA - Jake is 6 years old. He should not be responsible for the well being of a 16 year old. It is okay to miss someone and feel sad that they are going, but he is also coming back. Her mother needs to teach her that people she loves may go on trips and vacations and that they return. Also, that it is okay. \n\nJake is a child and should not be caught up in adult problems, even if Abby did experience trauma, but he is not adult enough to handle that adult issue. Abby needs therapy or support from maybe\u2026 dare I say it\u2026 parents. \n\nLet the adults take care of Abby and let Jake live his childhood. \n\nNTA - SIL just let her mamma bear claws come out and put Abby ahead of Jake. Let the seas calm before trying to come to a resolution.", "NTA. They're seriously putting a person's whole wellbeing on a 6 year old?! He's 6! So much pressure that he likely doesn't understand yet.

I get that SIL is looking out for her child, but surely she must see it's unhealthy and unfair to your son too?\n\nDefinitely move out before it becomes even worse and Abby leans on Jake even more. Obviously my heart goes out to her, without knowing what she went through, she obviously has been struggling with it, but you need to look out for your child's wellbeing and what's best for him.

Your SIL owe you an apology for blowing up like that, not the other way around.", "NTA\n\nGet the hell out of there before Jake internalises the message that he exists to support others.\n\nShe wants a six-year-old to apologise to her for going on a long-planned trip to Disneyland with his grandparents. The absolute nerve.\n\nLeaving will be best for both Jake and Abby.", "NTA.  You're right, your son is not a therapy/emotional support dog.  Otoh, your SIL is TA for not preparing her daughter adequately for the fact that Jake is not going to be her emotional support provider.", "NTA \nYour SIL just see your own navel (idk if the expression make any sense in English but ya)", "SIL is out of her mind. I get that she\u2019s looking out for her daughter, but your son is not a toy or emotional support animal (which is basically a fancy term for a pet). Abby will have to get used to him not being there at some point. Instead of carrying on with the \u201care you really going to let him go?\u201d malarkey, she should have spent the couple of weeks notice prepping her daughter to get along without him. NTA.", "NTA \n\nBut be weary already, the sort of hold and attachment Abby has had for Jake already has been borderline too much for your son.

Perhaps the family needs counselling to navigate through whatever is going on", "ESH.\n\nYou have let your 6 year old be used as an emotionnal supprt personn for weeks now.

I would also suggest that they should get an actual emotional support animal for Abby that will allow cuddling whenever she wants it.  Your son is reaching that age where he isn\u2019t going to want to cuddle anymore.  Is Abby or SIL planning on FORCING him to cuddle against his will???  So I would create some distance between Abby and Jake.  I saw you were thinking about moving back in with your parents. This sounds like a good option to me.  It creates that distance and it also puts enough distance that Abby can\u2019t use him as a crutch when your back is turned.

But what she is doing to your son, they way she is depending on him, is seriously bad news. He's clearly a lovely, empathetic little boy, who adores his cousin, but honestly, he is so vulnerable.

You said he doesn't normally sit still for long (what 6 year old does?!) but he let's his cousin cuddle him for long periods. He wakes her from naps. He's going to the park with her so she gets out the house. That precious little boy is already bearing a heavy burden he couldn't possibly comprehend.

That's fucked up. You have to get out of their ASAP. When your son is older, he might not remember this. But he's probably going to have emotions strongly equated to this time in his life, & connected to his cousin. He might feel guilt & confusion without knowing why. He might develop anxiety.

Your son is going to be upset about moving out as it is now, you will have work to do to ensure he knows he's done nothing wrong, & that Abby will be ok without him. \n\nYour brother is going to have to make sure Abby's therapist knows the extent of what's been happening at home.

It's common for people with trauma to fixate on other people's problems so as to avoid dealing with their own. I know of this personally.  It's damaging behavior.

What sucks extra for you is dealing with all this drama while you yourself are in the fog of grief, I'm sorry, it's a lot.", "First I'm so sorry for your loss. I literally cannot imagine what you and your son are going through. Just know you are a great mother and, although times are so hard now, your son will look back on you with pride on how you handled everything and was there for him. Give yourself a break if you can when you get back with your parents. Even if it's just eating ice cream and watching a feel good movie in bed one night. You are definitely NTA at all. If your niece needs companionship like that, she needs to get a pet or something else.\n\nMost states offer free or significantly reduced health care for low income children which includes therapy. You may want to look into that for your son. And if you are able to swing it, it probably won't hurt to see a therapist separate from your son as well as joint sessions here and there. I was once a low income mother and these services helped so much with ensuring my son got help whenever he needed it.\n\nAlso, if you haven't already, look into survivor benefits for you and your husband. You can definitely get benefits for your child and may qualify for survivor benefits for widows. I'd advise looking up social security survivor benefits and talking to someone from social security to help explain it better. Hopefully this can help you financially get on your feet.\n\nOne more thing I recommend is to make sure your husband didn't leave behind any benefits for you. For instance, my husband's work pays for one year salary without extra contribution in case of death. He can buy another year or two's salary for just a couple dollars a month. You may want to double check if he had access to these types of benefits. Also, check your state's unclaimed money site for your husband's name. If a company tried to pay out funds he overpaid or couldn't reach someone about a benefit, they turn it over to the state to put on that site. I'd also check there to see if he maybe has some unclaimed benefits you can access.", "It might be a good idea to talk to her about what happened. At least to make sure she understands your viewpoint on the matter and that you aren't upset or angry with her and to explain your concerns about her attachment to your son, she probably doesn't even realize she is becoming too attached to him. Make sure she knows why you are doing what you are doing and that it is simply what you think is best for your sons wellbeing.\n\nMost likely, after hearing about your son going on this trip, she started worrying and stressing and feeling anxiety in the back of her mind, perhaps not even realizing herself how attached she has become to her cousin. Eventually all that worrying has led to her outburst upon him actually leaving for the trip, but now that things have calmed down she might be internally stressing, blaming herself for what happened.\n\nShe is probably bashing herself up with worry about being blamed for that whole incident. So definitely make sure she knows it isn't her fault or that you blame her for what happened.\n\nJust make sure to have a calm and reasonable discussions with everyone involved and don't let emotions take control of the talks.\n\nAfter reading this post and your comments, my heart goes out to you and your family, I can only imagine how much anguish and grief everyone is in.\n\nBest wishes!

Do not allow him to bear this burden any longer, run to your parents house!!", "NTA.\n\nSo... your SIL thinks a 6 year old child is responsible for the mental and emotional health of her 17 year old daughter and also believes that this same 6 year old child has to apologize when he's literally done nothing wrong.\n\nAnd now she wants to throw you both out of the house, which - ironically - would mean that her daughter would lose the company of the one person who's currently making her happy, which seems like the SIL would be cutting off her nose to spite her face.\n\nClearly none of this is your fault. It's good that Abby's in therapy, but I think the SIL needs to be in therapy as well, because her responses are over-the-top, even considering her concern for her daughter.\n\n(note: I don't know if you're in a position to move out,but if you can, it would make sense to put some distance between the SIL and the two of you, at least for the time being.)", "NTA... Jake should never hear about Abbys need or dependance or breakdown at his going to disneyland. That is way too much to put on a 6 year old boy. It is best to get out of that house ASAP.  SIL is not thinking straight and I am worried she will traumatize your boy. \n\nDo you have any alternatives?", "NTA. You are right. Jake is not his cousin's emotional support dog. I feel for Abby but curtailing Jake's opportunities is not the solution to her distress.", "NTA- a 17 year old can easily grasp the concept that neglecting a 6 year old is a bad thing. They need therapy or a support item/animal not a support child, it's not a thing for a reason because it's unhealthy and I hope Abby does get treatment for her issue but you're doing good protecting your son and his interests too", "NTA.  Your comments about Jake being used like an emotional support dog are right on target.  That's exactly how your sister-in-law is treating him.  The fact that Jake going away for a few days with his grandparents caused such a reaction from both Abby and her mother indicate that this is no longer a healthy situation for Jake.  I don't know what trauma Abby has been through and I hope it gets better for her soon.  However, Jake is 6, just a little boy and it is not okay for your SIL to expect Jake to be completely tethered to Abby.  Abby breaking down and crying in front of Jake because she can't deal with him leaving is not okay either.  He is too young to handle of burden of what Abby needs.  \n\nYour SIL is being completely irrational, even her husband can see this.   If she's not normally like this then maybe it's the stress of dealing with what is going on with her daughter that's causing her to behave this way.  Regardless as Jakes mom it's your job to to put his wellbeing first and getting him some distance from this situation is probably the best thing for him.", "NTA. Jake is a child, not a fn service animal. Going through trauma is horrible and I'm glad she's in therapy, but the well-being of a 17yo should NOT in any way be solely dependant on a 6yo child. If your niece needs 24/7 companionship that badly for her issues than tell your sister that your niece needs a service dog/pet.", "NTA\n\nJake isn't Abby's personal comfort toy. She can't be allowed to stunt his life just because she has attachment issues or went through something traumatic. I mean, what, are both you and Jake just expected to keep your lives on hold until she gets over her issues? If she can't stand him being gone for a couple days what's she going to be like if he wanted to go to summer camp, or a sleep over, and god forbid you had to move for work or Jake's schooling.", "NTA\n\nYou are correct that your son is not an emotional support dog.\n\n\nI'd stop letting Jake visit this teenager.  It is unfortunate that this will negatively affect the teen but the relationship is almost certainly negatively affecting your son. What kind of pressure are they putting on him?\n\nThey are taking both your and your son's kindness for granted\n\nDon't let your son go back", "Your sister is using your son as an emotional support animal for your niece. This is unacceptable and you needed to have a conversation with her.", "A 17 year old is more responsible for their actions and emotions than a 6 year old child. You\u2019re not the asshole, you enabled your son to have a magical experience. Since he\u2019s been such a help to her, she should be happy for him.\n\nI cannot imagine acting that way when I was 17.", "The fact that Abby wasn't happy for him to have a good time shows this attachment is unhealthy and needs to end. NTA", "NTA\n\nAbby's therapy needs to go into high gear; does her therapist even know the way she relies on Jake? \n\nIt's not his responsibility to be her world. You cannot put this on a child. He has to be able to live life in between comforting her, and she needs to find comfort in other ways so that she doesn't 'collapse' when he has to go.", "NTA but you will be if you continue to let your son be used in this way. The relationship between your niece and son has become very unhealthy. Your son is definitely going to be negatively impacted by being used to make your niece feel better. He could grow up to be in codependent relationships and feel responsible for \u201cfixing\u201d broken people, and neglecting his own needs. It\u2019s not healthy for him and it\u2019s not healthy for your niece. Your SIL\u2019s expectations are absolutely wild and she needs professional help with her daughter.", "WTAF is happening here. The kid is 6 YEARS OLD. Your SIL is UNHINGED. NTA.", "NTA.   \nYour SIL is the A H.  \nShe's encouraging a very very dangerous co-dependence for her 17-year-old, onto a six-year-old. This relationship may be sweet, cute, and really helping her, but it is at a cost to your son that you won't see for many years to come.    \nThe reliance on a 6-year-old for her has already gone too far. WAY too far. It can, and will get more intense if it is not stopped. Her trauma bonding to him is not healthy, and now she's fully reliant on him to the point they tried to stop your five year old living his own independent life.   \n The cost to him, emotionally/mentally as I said will come... and it's not a good one. Both of them will suffer long term.   \nHe cannot be remotely responsible for her comfort/happiness/etc.  \"He's only 6! and he's soooo sweet, thoughtful, etc, look at how he helps her, she's doing so well with him.\" NO.   \nAs hard as it is, if you can, you need to move out. For the sake of your son, and honestly for the sake of his cousin.  \n\n\nAnd uh... BTW... JAKE... a SIX-YEAR-OLD, doesn't owe ANYONE an apology. What did HE do? What? That is 100% UNHINGED. Get him out of there. Don't let him around him unsupervised for a long time... seriously. There is something wrong with her on that one.", "Your brother and SIL are toxic, and I'm sure Abby is partially messed up because of them. It's extremely selfish of them to expect Jake to give up going to Disneyland because their daughter created an extremely unhealthy attachment to Jake. Get out while you can, don't let them fuck Jake up too", "Nta. You made my daughter cry by letting him go, so now ill kick you both out. Yeah, that makes sense. Hope you can find some comfort with your parents, I'm sorry to you and to the little one for the loss. Hugs.", "NTA, and as others have stated you need to separate Jake from Abby, it sounds like SIL is trying to use Jake as you put it \"supper dog\" which is totally unfair to a 6 year old, it sounds like Abby needs some serious therapy asap to process what ever she is going through.", "NTA. A six year old should not be the emotional crutch for a 17 year old.", "So, so, so NTA          \nYour poor son.        \nYour SIL is pushing this on him because she doesn\u2019t want to deal with it herself.         \nShe\u2019s making a 6 year old responsible for what he\u2019s too young to do.       \nI know you\u2019ve said your brother is closer to work but you desperately need to get him out of that house.        \nDon\u2019t let him go back at all, not even for a minute.            \nMove before he comes home.       \nCan he stay with your in laws for a few days or a week until you\u2019ve moved into your parents ?", "I think Abby was only ok with Jake going to Disney because SIL was telling her that he wasn\u2019t really going to go.        \nThat\u2019s why it hit her so hard when he was leaving and SIL was shocked.        \nShe assumed either Jake would give up Disney or his mum would make him give it up", "NTA\n\nthis is utterly insane. She wants a 6 year old to apologize for spending time with his grandparents and going to an amusement park? She literally would have preferred he be isolated from the people who love him so he can provide emotional support to someone who is nearly an adult.\n\nNothing about this is healthy. I can pretty much guarantee, based on what you've said, that he already feels responsible for her emotional state.\n\nYou need to get him out of this situation as soon as possible and re establish healthy boundaries....the whole thing about him not being one to sit still but he'll let her cuddle with him for hours...yikes.\n\nGet out before your niece or her mom explodes on your 6 year old for behaving appropriately.", "Totally different level here but when my son was 9, he was involved in a sport, and the organisers were reluctant to let him go up an age level, despite having earned it, because he was such a great 'role-model' for the younger kids in his current group.\n\nMy reaction is that he was 9 years old, and wasn't there for the purpose of being a role-model.  If that was a bonus, great, but he was there to learn and play the sport.  For himself, because he was 9 years old.\n\nYour son is SIX.  If he can be a comfort to his cousin, that's great, but it should not be a burden upon him.  You are right, his life should not be put on pause in order to fulfil a role that is not his job.\n\nIf his cousin can not be without him for a couple of days, she is not getting enough effective help.", "NTA, at all. This is a severely unhealthy attachment, and I would check in with Jake to see how he is doing with it...but your child is not an emotional support child, he needs to have a life, and no, Abby does not come before your kid for you, your top priority should be your son, you are doing well, OP!"]}
