I feel for her with all my heart and am doing all I can to be there for her.\n\nDuring this time, Abby\u2019s become really close to Jake. It was sweet enough at first and even though Jake isn\u2019t one to sit in one place for long, he didn\u2019t say anything and allows his cousin to cuddle and spend time with him.\n\nHe does a lot for her and will wake her up when she takes naps for too long, will go out to the park with her to make sure she doesn\u2019t stay at home too long etc. My SIL was extremely appreciative of this and Abby seems to be happier when he\u2019s around. Of course, Abby is in therapy so I didn\u2019t think she was dependent on my son to get her through the day. \n\nBut a couple weeks ago, Jake\u2019s paternal grandparents wanted to take him to Disneyland for a couple days and he was so excited. He kept telling everyone how much fun he was going to have and more. Abby didn\u2019t say much whenever he\u2019d mention Disneyland but my SIL asked me if he was actually going multiple times.\n\nI said yes, why would I stop my son from going to Disneyland? She asked if his grandparents could take him on this trip another time but I told her that wouldn\u2019t be possible. She was upset but stopped.\n\nThe other day, his grandparents came to pick him up and he was sitting with Abby getting ready to go when she suddenly broke down crying. Jake got scared and started crying as well so I separated them. They calmed down and Jake left for Disneyland some time later. \n\nMy SIL was furious. She came up to me and was like \u201cso you really let him go?\u201d I said yes, again, why wouldn\u2019t I? She was all like \u201cyou saw how my daughter reacted to him leaving and you\u2019re still confused?\u201d Apparently, Abby really didn\u2019t want him to go and she cried because he was leaving. I told her that this was extremely unfair for her to say. \n\nMy SIL said that I was being unfair and that Disneyland is not more important than her daughter\u2019s well being. I never said this, but I told her that my son isn\u2019t her emotional support dog and while I\u2019m very sorry about Abby, it isn\u2019t fair to put my 6 year old son\u2019s life on pause. He\u2019s 6!!! It\u2018a unfair for her to force my son to give up things for the comfort of his cousin. \n\nSIL called me heartless and said she wants me gone from the house before Jake gets back because she isn\u2019t putting Abby through this again. My brother intervened and told her that she\u2019s acting irrationally but she told him to stfu. It\u2019s been really tense and while I did attempt to apologize, SIL told me that the only apology she\u2019d accept is one from Jake but I\u2019m not going to make him apologize so AITA? I really don\u2019t think so but Abby is genuinely upset about Jake leaving.", "created_utc": 1684999412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ravnr/aita_for_letting_my_son_go_to_disneyland/", "score": 169, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Everything he\u2019s done for Abby is incredible but also above and beyond, absolutely not without the realm of expectation for a 6 year old.\n\nIn general I would try to distance him from Abby a little bit, because this seems like a very unhealthy attachment that could lead to some kind of trauma in turn for your own child.", "NTA.\n\nI was feeling at least a little sympathy for your SIL throughout your story, almost enough to make me vote N-A-H, until I got to this bit: \n\n*SIL told me that the only apology she'd accept is one from Jake*\n\nShe wants an apology from a six-year-old? An apology for WHAT? For going to Disneyland with his grandparents? She thinks Jake has done something to be blamed for?\n\nIt's not even as if Jake had any choice in the matter. Six-year-olds get to choose what flavor of ice cream they want, or what sweater to wear today. They don't get to choose things on the scale of trips to Disneyland. Adults make those arrangements, and they say \"Jake, you're going to Disneyland!\" The kid's job is to jump up and down and say \"Oh, boy! When?\" and to go, and to have a great time. Jake has nothing to apologize for, and for your SIL to pretend that he does is cruel.\n\nI feel for Abby, but her mental wellbeing is neither Jake's responsibility nor yours.\n\nYou need to get out of that house and find other living arrangements as soon as you can. \n\n*I told her that my son isn't her emotional support dog.* Harsh, but accurate.", "NTA. I don\u2019t sympathize with adults who act like you must have the capability to read their minds. SIL had every chance in the world to *use her words* and explain any feelings she had.

Be packed up and ready to go when Jake returns if at all possible.", "NTA. Your son is entitled to special experiences and special memories with his grandparents. There\u2019s no way his childhood should be put on pause for the sake of his cousin.", "NTA.  As you said, your son is not Abby's service animal. It's absolutely ridiculous for your SIL to expect your son to spend the foreseeable future crying over missing out on the opportunity to go to Disneyland with his grandparents just so that his nearly grown cousin doesn't have a meltdown. It's no wonder she's in therapy when her parents seem to be bending over backwards to give her an unrealistic existence that is entirely devoid of anxiety. You're honestly better off staying somewhere other than with your brother's crazy wife.", "NTA. As you said, your son is not your niece's emotional support animal. It's absurd for your SIL to think that she had any right to keep your son around as such. You do not owe her an apology.", "NTA. I understand that you were trying to help Abby and Jake is also helping, and it is a great thing to do. But Jake is 6 years old, and he should not be giving up his own life and enjoyment just so that Abby will not be upset. Like you said, Jake is not an emotion support dog, and it is ridiculous of your SIL to even make that sort of demands on your son.\n\nHope Jake had a great time in Disneyland, but like others say, I suggest you keep an eye on the interactions between Abby and Jake, in case they unload further emotional baggage for Jake to carry. Abby is family, but Jake is also a little boy who deserves to have a normal childhood without having to bear the emotional baggage for someone else. Leave that to the professionals.", "Lol, your SIL is the one who needs therapy and treatment. She has too many issues.", "NTA\n\nIt very much sounds like Abby is not the only one traumatised here, her mum is profoundly affected as well, to the point she's being unreasonable and thinks the world revolves around her needs. She's so blinded by the trauma and desperate want to make thing better that she's neglecting other people's needs and rights. The fact she's demanding an apology from Jake - a 6 years old!!! - is really telling you how out of touch with reality she is at the moment. She needs healing as much as Abby does, but that's not yours and Jake's problem.\n\nYou're absolutely right that your son is not Abby's emotional support dog. His life can't stop because Abby started using him as a crutch and clinging onto him.\n\nFor all parties involved, I think it's best that you remove yourself and Jake from your SIL's house altogether and keep your distance for quite some time. Why were you staying with them in the first place, was it to support them? As sad as it their situation is, you can't be dragged into other people's mess because it will start affecting your mental health. You need distance and leave Abby's family to heal in their own time.", "what the actual fuck! she can\u2019t put that kind of responsibility on a six year old, he\u2019s a CHILD!!! i feel for your niece, i do but your SIL and Abby can\u2019t rely on your son for emotional support and should be working with her therapist to find better coping mechanisms. SIL should probably start her own therapy since she wants to punish a six year old for going to disneyland. \n\nNTA and you have nothing to apologise for.", "NTA. It's insane of your SIL to expect your SIX YEAR OLD to be her child's emotional support person. It's good your brother intervened, and you have nothing to apologize for. If possible, I  think it would be better for you to live somewhere else", "You need to get out of there - this is bordering on abuse towards Jake, who should never, at 6 years old, be made to feel responsible for a much older child's mental health. \n\nHe sounds like a sweet and mature child but they're taking advantage and treating him like a service animal. I'm actually quite astounded. He didn't cause Abby's issues and he's not responsible for her recovery. You should not, at any point, consider making him apologise. Your SIL has become unhinged and using your kid to make her kid feel better. Wtf.\n\nJake going to Disneyland is the best thing that could have happened. Poor kid. Get out of there.", "NTA - Jake is 6 years old. He should not be responsible for the well being of a 16 year old. It is okay to miss someone and feel sad that they are going, but he is also coming back. Her mother needs to teach her that people she loves may go on trips and vacations and that they return. Also, that it is okay. \n\nJake is a child and should not be caught up in adult problems, even if Abby did experience trauma, but he is not adult enough to handle that adult issue. Abby needs therapy or support from maybe\u2026 dare I say it\u2026 parents. \n\nLet the adults take care of Abby and let Jake live his childhood. \n\nNTA - SIL just let her mamma bear claws come out and put Abby ahead of Jake. Let the seas calm before trying to come to a resolution.", "NTA. They're seriously putting a person's whole wellbeing on a 6 year old?! He's 6! So much pressure that he likely doesn't understand yet. Also for SIL to want an apology from a 6 year old for going away for 2 days \ud83e\udd2f \nThe level of attachment is unhealthy and way too much to put this on a 6 year old. I get that SIL is looking out for her child, but surely she must see it's unhealthy and unfair to your son too?\n\nDefinitely move out before it becomes even worse and Abby leans on Jake even more. Obviously my heart goes out to her, without knowing what she went through, she obviously has been struggling with it, but you need to look out for your child's wellbeing and what's best for him. Is having the pressure of being an \"emotional support dog\" to his teenage cousin good for him?", "NTA. You are right. Your son is not her emotional support dog. Your SIL owe you an apology for blowing up like that, not the other way around.", "NTA\n\nGet the hell out of there before Jake internalises the message that he exists to support others.\n\nShe wants a six-year-old to apologise to her for going on a long-planned trip to Disneyland with his grandparents. The absolute nerve.\n\nLeaving will be best for both Jake and Abby.", "NTA.  You're right, your son is not a therapy/emotional support dog.  Otoh, your SIL is TA for not preparing her daughter adequately for the fact that Jake is not going to be her emotional support provider.", "NTA \nYour SIL just see your own navel (idk if the expression make any sense in English but ya)", "SIL is out of her mind. I get that she\u2019s looking out for her daughter, but your son is not a toy or emotional support animal (which is basically a fancy term for a pet). Abby will have to get used to him not being there at some point. Instead of carrying on with the \u201care you really going to let him go?\u201d malarkey, she should have spent the couple of weeks notice prepping her daughter to get along without him. NTA.", "NTA \n\nBut be weary already, the sort of hold and attachment Abby has had for Jake already has been borderline too much for your son. I think it's time for you to move out, and force a separation to happen, because the way your SIL is acting, she considers only Abby in this, Jake is just a tool to help Abby temporarily.", "NTA obviously, I literally gasped at her expecting the child to apologize. What the actual fuck. \n\nSoft yta for you not doing anything to stop it sooner, but you obvi recognize that now, and SIL is so unhinged that it\u2019s not worth esh", "Does your SIL think you are a mind reader? Not that this makes any difference to whether or not you\u2019re the AH (you\u2019re absolutely not), why didn\u2019t she speak to you directly and explain how hard him leaving would be on Abby? Perhaps you could have all talked about it and helped Abby cope with him going away for a couple days. Instead, you\u2019re in this passive-aggressive twilight zone situation that could have been largely avoided with some basic communication. Good god. You\u2019re NTA but SIL sure is. And she\u2019s not helping Abby at all heal from whatever trauma she experienced. Perhaps the family needs counselling to navigate through whatever is going on", "ESH.\n\nYou have let your 6 year old be used as an emotionnal supprt personn for weeks now.

Look after yourself \u2764\ufe0f", "Is your SIL in therapy as well?", "Your son sounds like a sweet kid and all and it's nice that he wants to help, but it's your job as the parent to protect him and that includes protection from unhealthy situations and dynamics like this where he can neither fully understand nor advocate for his own wellbeing. He should never have been put in a situation where he's being her cuddle plushie for hours or having to beg her to leave her room.", "Your 6 year old kid did not understand. He does not have the emotionnal capacity to understand what's happening with his relationship with his cousin. \n\nYou saw it coming. You wrote yourself that your saw Abby's behaviour changing when she learned your kid was going to be gone for a few days. \n\nThe fact that your SIL has to tell you to leave shows that you still don't understand anything. When your kid gets back, your niece is going to go back to using your son as a confort doll and you're not going to do anything about it because \"your son wants to do it\". He's 6. He's a sweet kid but it's not his job to take care of anybody who has been through trauma. \n\nGet your own fucking place.", "Sil isn't telling her to leave to stop Abby from using Jake as an emotional support animal. Sil is telling her to leave because Jake was allowed to go to Disneyland.", "Of course he doesn\u2019t understand the deep parts of it and I doubt he understands that Abby is attached to him. But he does understand that he can say NO. He\u2019s done it before. \u201cSorry Abby, I don\u2019t want to go to the park today because I\u2019m tired.\u201d Or \u201cWe can do this tomorrow because I\u2019m going to my friend\u2019s house today.\u201d He doesn\u2019t have the emotional capacity to understand what is happening, but he knows how he feels enough to be able to express it. \n\nI saw Abby\u2019s changing behaviour but she was getting a lot better at the same time. Taking initiative when it came to her mental health and all that. She\u2019d get a little quiet when the Disneyland topic came up but I figured that being sad he was going was alright. Hell, even I\u2019m sad he isn\u2019t with me right now. \n\nI\u2019m not going to force my son to do anything, and boy would I love to get my own place. Unfortunately, it\u2019s quite literally impossible for me. I know, I hate it too. But don\u2019t worry, I do plan on moving out with my son by the time he gets back because I recognize that there is an unhealthy relationship here. Thank you.", "You\u2019re a good parent OP, it\u2019s obvious you\u2019ve raised your son to be a loving person but also one with good boundaries.  As others have said,  it would be a good idea to consider separating the two a bit more now"]}
