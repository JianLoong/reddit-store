I feel for her with all my heart and am doing all I can to be there for her.\n\nDuring this time, Abby\u2019s become really close to Jake. It was sweet enough at first and even though Jake isn\u2019t one to sit in one place for long, he didn\u2019t say anything and allows his cousin to cuddle and spend time with him.\n\nHe does a lot for her and will wake her up when she takes naps for too long, will go out to the park with her to make sure she doesn\u2019t stay at home too long etc. My SIL was extremely appreciative of this and Abby seems to be happier when he\u2019s around. Of course, Abby is in therapy so I didn\u2019t think she was dependent on my son to get her through the day. \n\nBut a couple weeks ago, Jake\u2019s paternal grandparents wanted to take him to Disneyland for a couple days and he was so excited. He kept telling everyone how much fun he was going to have and more. Abby didn\u2019t say much whenever he\u2019d mention Disneyland but my SIL asked me if he was actually going multiple times.\n\nI said yes, why would I stop my son from going to Disneyland? She asked if his grandparents could take him on this trip another time but I told her that wouldn\u2019t be possible. She was upset but stopped.\n\nThe other day, his grandparents came to pick him up and he was sitting with Abby getting ready to go when she suddenly broke down crying. Jake got scared and started crying as well so I separated them. They calmed down and Jake left for Disneyland some time later. \n\nMy SIL was furious. She came up to me and was like \u201cso you really let him go?\u201d I said yes, again, why wouldn\u2019t I? She was all like \u201cyou saw how my daughter reacted to him leaving and you\u2019re still confused?\u201d Apparently, Abby really didn\u2019t want him to go and she cried because he was leaving. I told her that this was extremely unfair for her to say. \n\nMy SIL said that I was being unfair and that Disneyland is not more important than her daughter\u2019s well being. I never said this, but I told her that my son isn\u2019t her emotional support dog and while I\u2019m very sorry about Abby, it isn\u2019t fair to put my 6 year old son\u2019s life on pause. He\u2019s 6!!! It\u2018a unfair for her to force my son to give up things for the comfort of his cousin. \n\nSIL called me heartless and said she wants me gone from the house before Jake gets back because she isn\u2019t putting Abby through this again. My brother intervened and told her that she\u2019s acting irrationally but she told him to stfu. It\u2019s been really tense and while I did attempt to apologize, SIL told me that the only apology she\u2019d accept is one from Jake but I\u2019m not going to make him apologize so AITA? I really don\u2019t think so but Abby is genuinely upset about Jake leaving.\n\nEdit:\n\nI was repeating my SIL\u2019s words word for word but giving her the benefit of the doubt, I believe she meant that the only apology she\u2019d accept is one in the form of Jake. Not that it makes it any better, but I don\u2019t think she actually wants him to say I\u2019m sorry. But I could be wrong as well. Either way, I wasn\u2019t going to apologize the way she wants me to.", "created_utc": 1684999412, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ravnr/aita_for_letting_my_son_go_to_disneyland/", "score": 959, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

An apology for WHAT? For going to Disneyland with his grandparents? She thinks Jake has done something to be blamed for?\n\nIt's not even as if Jake had any choice in the matter. Six-year-olds get to choose what flavor of ice cream they want, or what sweater to wear today. They don't get to choose things on the scale of trips to Disneyland. Adults make those arrangements, and they say \"Jake, you're going to Disneyland!\" The kid's job is to jump up and down and say \"Oh, boy! When?\" and to go, and to have a great time. Jake has nothing to apologize for, and for your SIL to pretend that he does is cruel.\n\nI feel for Abby, but her mental wellbeing is neither Jake's responsibility nor yours.\n\nYou need to get out of that house and find other living arrangements as soon as you can. \n\n*I told her that my son isn't her emotional support dog.* Harsh, but accurate.", "NTA.

Be packed up and ready to go when Jake returns if at all possible.", "NTA. Your son is entitled to special experiences and special memories with his grandparents. There\u2019s no way his childhood should be put on pause for the sake of his cousin.", "NTA.  As you said, your son is not Abby's service animal. It's absolutely ridiculous for your SIL to expect your son to spend the foreseeable future crying over missing out on the opportunity to go to Disneyland with his grandparents just so that his nearly grown cousin doesn't have a meltdown. It's no wonder she's in therapy when her parents seem to be bending over backwards to give her an unrealistic existence that is entirely devoid of anxiety. You're honestly better off staying somewhere other than with your brother's crazy wife.", "NTA. As you said, your son is not your niece's emotional support animal. It's absurd for your SIL to think that she had any right to keep your son around as such. You do not owe her an apology.", "NTA. I understand that you were trying to help Abby and Jake is also helping, and it is a great thing to do. But Jake is 6 years old, and he should not be giving up his own life and enjoyment just so that Abby will not be upset. Like you said, Jake is not an emotion support dog, and it is ridiculous of your SIL to even make that sort of demands on your son.\n\nHope Jake had a great time in Disneyland, but like others say, I suggest you keep an eye on the interactions between Abby and Jake, in case they unload further emotional baggage for Jake to carry. Abby is family, but Jake is also a little boy who deserves to have a normal childhood without having to bear the emotional baggage for someone else. Leave that to the professionals.", "Lol, your SIL is the one who needs therapy and treatment. She has too many issues.", "NTA\n\nIt very much sounds like Abby is not the only one traumatised here, her mum is profoundly affected as well, to the point she's being unreasonable and thinks the world revolves around her needs. She's so blinded by the trauma and desperately wants to make thing better that she's neglecting other people's needs and rights. The fact she's demanding an apology from Jake - a 6 years old!!! - is really telling you how out of touch with reality she is at the moment. She needs healing as much as Abby does, but that's not yours and Jake's problem.\n\nYou're absolutely right that your son is not Abby's emotional support dog. His life can't stop because Abby started using him as a crutch and clinging onto him.\n\nFor all parties involved, I think it's best that you remove yourself and Jake from your SIL's house altogether and keep your distance for quite some time. Why were you staying with them in the first place, was it to support them? As sad as it their situation is, you can't be dragged into other people's mess because it will start affecting your mental health. You need distance and leave Abby's family to heal in their own time.", "what the actual fuck! she can\u2019t put that kind of responsibility on a six year old, he\u2019s a CHILD!!! i feel for your niece, i do but your SIL and Abby can\u2019t rely on your son for emotional support and should be working with her therapist to find better coping mechanisms. SIL should probably start her own therapy since she wants to punish a six year old for going to disneyland. \n\nNTA and you have nothing to apologise for.", "NTA. It's insane of your SIL to expect your SIX YEAR OLD to be her child's emotional support person. It's good your brother intervened, and you have nothing to apologize for. If possible, I  think it would be better for you to live somewhere else", "You need to get out of there - this is bordering on abuse towards Jake, who should never, at 6 years old, be made to feel responsible for a much older child's mental health. \n\nHe sounds like a sweet and mature child but they're taking advantage and treating him like a service animal. I'm actually quite astounded. He didn't cause Abby's issues and he's not responsible for her recovery. You should not, at any point, consider making him apologise. Your SIL has become unhinged and using your kid to make her kid feel better. Wtf.\n\nJake going to Disneyland is the best thing that could have happened. Poor kid. Get out of there.", "NTA - Jake is 6 years old. He should not be responsible for the well being of a 16 year old. It is okay to miss someone and feel sad that they are going, but he is also coming back. Her mother needs to teach her that people she loves may go on trips and vacations and that they return. Also, that it is okay. \n\nJake is a child and should not be caught up in adult problems, even if Abby did experience trauma, but he is not adult enough to handle that adult issue. Abby needs therapy or support from maybe\u2026 dare I say it\u2026 parents. \n\nLet the adults take care of Abby and let Jake live his childhood. \n\nNTA - SIL just let her mamma bear claws come out and put Abby ahead of Jake.

I get that SIL is looking out for her child, but surely she must see it's unhealthy and unfair to your son too?\n\nDefinitely move out before it becomes even worse and Abby leans on Jake even more. Obviously my heart goes out to her, without knowing what she went through, she obviously has been struggling with it, but you need to look out for your child's wellbeing and what's best for him.

Your SIL owe you an apology for blowing up like that, not the other way around.", "NTA\n\nGet the hell out of there before Jake internalises the message that he exists to support others.\n\nShe wants a six-year-old to apologise to her for going on a long-planned trip to Disneyland with his grandparents. The absolute nerve.\n\nLeaving will be best for both Jake and Abby.", "NTA.  You're right, your son is not a therapy/emotional support dog.  Otoh, your SIL is TA for not preparing her daughter adequately for the fact that Jake is not going to be her emotional support provider.", "NTA \nYour SIL just see your own navel (idk if the expression make any sense in English but ya)", "SIL is out of her mind. I get that she\u2019s looking out for her daughter, but your son is not a toy or emotional support animal (which is basically a fancy term for a pet). Abby will have to get used to him not being there at some point. Instead of carrying on with the \u201care you really going to let him go?\u201d malarkey, she should have spent the couple of weeks notice prepping her daughter to get along without him. NTA.", "NTA \n\nBut be weary already, the sort of hold and attachment Abby has had for Jake already has been borderline too much for your son.

I don\u2019t know what happened but my brother and SIL aren\u2019t on speaking terms at the moment. \n\nAs for me and my kid\u2026 money\u2019s tight but with all the help I\u2019m getting, I think I can manage a couple appointments for my son. Or I could have him speak to his school\u2019s guidance counsellor. \n\nThank you so very much.", "I agree. This is even worse for him and what he\u2019s going through.", "Jesus Christ. How out of touch are you.", "I have not spoken to Abby directly since I separated them but only because I work most of the day and she stays in her room and is usually asleep by the time I get back.", "HOLY SHIT I SOMEHOW SKIPPED THAT DETAIL THANK YOU FOR POINTING IT OUT!!!!! God from the way the story was going I thought the cousin was around the same age as OPs son. This is EXTRA NTA territory and that is *very* unhealthy for a 17 year old to have such a strong attachment to a 6 year old who isn't a sibling. I think it's best OP gets him out of that house and living somewhere else.", "Wtf\u203d she's 11 years older than J? Run OP this is getting strange", "Not knowing what actually happened to Abby - which I am not asking to find out - but it could be something so bad that her mum is also dealing with some trauma. And Jake is the only thing that brings her any joy... It isn't justified or right, but I do have some sympathy for them. \n\nBut Jake is 6 ffs. As OP said, he isn't a service dog.", "You're completely in the right with this choice, don't worry about that commenter. Safety is number one. As long as you and Jake are safe (ie, away from Abby and not in physical danger due to the area), the people you live with is a secondary matter. You don't have to rent beyond your means to take care of yourself and your son. In fact, having family support is probably good for him! Growing up surrounded by family loving and taking care of each other is better than in a small apartment in a bad neighborhood, despite what that commenter says. You sound like a wonderful parent.", "Ok, I didn\u2019t mean to seem rude just make sure your parents do not allow SIL over!", "I'm so sorry for your loss. My first husband passed away when our son was 6 too. I know it's hard but you definitely need to leave as soon as you can. This is not a healthy situation. Your SIL and niece need (more) professional help. Let your brother know everything that's going on and why you'll be leaving.", "Ugh, I wish I could give you a hug. Your father sounds like a wise man, and I'm glad you have a support network in place. For Abby's sake, I hope your brother and SIL figure everything out.", "Oh man. I am so sorry. And, yeah, that gives it a whole extra level that makes your SIL's reaction even worse. You and your child are still grieving your own loss, have your own trauma, and she wants you to bury all of that to take care of hers. And using a traumatized child to do so. I'm speechless.", "It would be unhealthy even if he was a sibling.", "Woww I also somehow misread that as Abby being 7, and thought it makes sense she\u2019s upset her cousin gets to go to Disneyland without her. But 17!!! That changes everything, NTA at all and keep them separated bc this attachment is extremely unhealthy!\n\nETA: just read OP\u2019s comment that her husband passed away two months ago, so this is a 6 year old who just LOST HIS FATHER!! So much is wrong with this situation smh.", "I know I thought they were the same age too by the way the story was going.  I was not expecting 17 when I went back to the beginning.", "Those are some major abuse vibes Im picking up.", "[removed]", "Oh no that\u2019s alright. I understand questions and the one you asked made enough sense :)", "I mean you're absolutely right, but at least it would be a lot more understandable cuz kids aren't always that reasonable. But cousin? Nah she needs some therapy.", "[removed]", "Definitely,hopefully for him the trip is magical.  For OP it has been eye opening.", "Yes, amen! I hope he forgot all about his little worries and had the best time ever!", "Exactly,  just because Abbey had something traumatic happen to her , that doesnt mean that her cousin's mental health has to suffer now too, she shouldn't be using her 6 year old cousin as an emotional crutch. \n\nShe needs more therapy,  maybe a support animal. However, Jake is not a pet. \n\nHe is a child that needs to live his own little life.\n\nOP seriously needs to distance herself and her son from Abbey and her SIL because SIL's behaviour is just as unhinged. \n\nSIL can't help her daughter deal with her issues, so she forces a 6 year old to instead, then berates that child's mother when mom does what's best for her child.\n\nI'd say its best to go no contact for a while.", "Sil also wants the 6 year old to apologize to her for going to Disneyland \ud83d\ude12 cuz you know, how dare her daughters ESA do something without her. This woman has problems", " NTA! Abby has serious attachment issues, tbh when Jake returns I would look into staying elsewhere to separate the two of them before her attachment to Jake grows even less healthy.", "Right? \"I'm sorry for being a child and having the audacity to want to have fun at a place made for children\"\n\nLike....the delusion.", "This is an indication of where the daughter gets her emotional distress and entitlement.", "This is one of the most bonkers thing of her to say. Who says that about a 6 yr old lol.", "Comment stolen from https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ravnr/aita_for_letting_my_son_go_to_disneyland/jljbmwm/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1&context=3", "Why is this post a word-for-word copy of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13ravnr/aita_for_letting_my_son_go_to_disneyland/jljeh5g/)?
