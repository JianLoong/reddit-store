So we needed a new roommate and my friend Jay expressed interest. Jay lived on campus his junior year because his parents are uptight.

Luckily they live in California so they haven\u2019t had a chance to see our place yet. \n\nBut now they\u2019re in New York for a vacation and wanted to stop by. Jay went crazy and started cleaning the house so it was perfect. He asked us to please keep our alcohol in the rooms and please take extra care to look after ourselves and be presentable while his parents stopped by. They wouldn\u2019t be staying with us but they\u2019d be seeing in the house. \n\nJay also told us we had to wear clothes when they\u2019re here, which is reasonable. Everyone\u2019s going to crucify me lol, but our house is very much full of typical gym bros and I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve worn anything but a muscle tank and underwear in the house since I\u2019ve moved on.

Remembering the rules, I put on a sweatshirt and a pair of boxer shorts. I go down the stairs and my roommates all look at me horrified for some reason. I introduce myself to his parents, make some nice conversation, make and eat some breakfast, clean up, and go up to my room. \n\nThat night when his parents are gone Jay is furious at me and I don\u2019t know why. He says I was supposed to get dressed and I did. It wasn\u2019t even supposed to be formal as everyone else had t-shirts and gym shorts/sweatpants. He says boxer shorts are underwear and I pointed out maybe a long time ago or in cartoons but not now. No one wears boxer shorts as underwear and I had underwear underneath.  No one under the age of 50 wears boxer shorts as underwear in my country so there\u2019s no way his parents would have thought they were underwear.

My roommates all disagreed and now o feel like I\u2019m crazy.
