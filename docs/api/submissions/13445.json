Yes it may be your only day off but you have taken an event that should be about her hitting a milestone that seems important to her and making it about yourself, even if you say you\u2019ll just have your cake and friends and not make a fuss, you are diverting attention from her on a day that she should get attention. She doesn\u2019t have a mom in her life and wanted you to do what a mom might do which is plan her 18th and make her feel really special and again, you made it about yourself.
