Why can't she do a small wedding in town and a desnation honeymoon like most people on a budget? If she can't afford fancy why the heck does she expect you to cover her wedding? Personally as I type this out it sounds like she doesn't want you as a maid of honor as much as she wants you to be her cash cow.

The wedding party\u2019s ONLY job is to show up for the wedding in the appropriate attire and stand next to the bride or groom.

Most people only give 1$ but you do get a few 5s and 10s maybe one or two 20s. Special person might give 50 or 100, but mostly a lot of 1s.\nThat being said, my generation is getting married now and a lot are skipping the dollar dance as it can be kind of tacky to ask guests for more money on top of travel to wedding, costs, and already generous gifts.

Every wedding I've been to hasn't done it.  One of my cousins married a Filipina woman and they didn't include the money dance.  Cousin's wife found it tacky and demeaning and refused to allow it, the money dance is a part of Filipino wedding tradition and is usually seen as a way to welcome the newlyweds into the family and give them a good start.

I didn't even k ow you're  supposed to bring a present.\n\nI think the guests and bridesmaids  do pay fir the bride's  portion of hen party ( but I think these are expensive a lot of times)\n\nWhy are you hosting more than one shower ?\n\nNTA.  It's not in your budget.  And you need to save  to attend the wedding..I sure can't drop 1500 to 2000 to attend a wedding without 6 months notice\n\nI've always paid for my  bridesmaid dress,  hair, shoes, makeup  when I was in weddings., but I guess I was lucky  as the bride's didn't pick expensive dresses and we could do our own make up.", "Spending almost \u20ac10,000 on someone else\u2019s wedding is insane. Your sister\u2019s response to your worry about costs is illustrative of how she\u2019s going to be throughout this process - don\u2019t change your mind on this. Even if you do absorb all these costs and participate in everything, you will be resentful (rightfully so), and she may not appreciate it, which will result in a ruined relationship regardless. \n\nI can\u2019t believe the sheer entitlement of your sister to request this. I don\u2019t understand people who think the entire world revolves around their special event.", "NTA. Most likely, she isn't being upfront about the costs to your other family, and is only saying you don't want to make the effort or buy a dress or something. Tell them you would love to help, but you're just not sure where you're going to get the 10 grand from (AKA the truth). I wouldn't be surprised your family will be just as shocked, and as soon as you're asking for financial help from them they'll get off your case real fast.   \n\n\nIf this is her step one, I wouldn't be surprised if the rest of her bridesmaids (and guests) begin bowing out once the details become known. Unless you're in a wealthy family, asking extended relatives to drop 1k+ to attend a wedding leads to a lot of empty seats.", "NTA. They\u2019re not going to have any friends left after this wedding.", ">\u201d\u2026when I found out what the expectations are I changed my mind.\u201d\n\nYour sister should want someone who embraces her expectations as MOH.  \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to do it justice, sis.\u201d  NTA.", "NTA your sister and BIL need their heads checked. Crazy, crazy shit to expect that stuff. I would absolutely not be doing that.", "Lol NTA. Look, you backed out quick. One day later. That\u2019s fair. Way better than waiting for a long time then doing so.\n\nYou also backed out after learning of the requirements. Had your sister communicated these requirements BEFORE you agreed that would have been a different story. \n\nI\u2019ll\u2026 reserve judgement on her choices. Since this is about whether you are TAH. Which imho, you certainly are not.\n\nIf your sister holds this against you, it\u2019s her issue. You aren\u2019t boycotting her wedding. Just saying you will attend within your means and at the level you can commit.", "[definitely not an \u201cAmerican thing\u201d](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_dance) , but definitely not uncommon all around the world. \n\nMy family is Polish-American, we ALL had dollar dances. I made $6K at my first wedding during mine. I eloped for my 2nd, so no dancing.", "I went to school in the Midwest and every wedding I've been to over there had a dollar dance, but the average amount per person was always like 5 dollars. Family would tend to give more, but its mostly just a fun little tradition, an extra \"I'm so happy for you\" to the bride and a chance to have a dance with her if you haven't yet.", "Yeah, I'm American and have been to exactly one wedding that had a dollar dance. It was really charming but I wouldn't recommend for anyone to do it if it's not actually part of their culture, because a) if I hadn't had a \"local\" friend to tell me what was happening I would have been confused, b) I wouldn't even necessarily have cash on me at a wedding unless I knew I'd need it, and c) part of what makes the tradition work is that it's reciprocal - you get money at your wedding and you give money to other people at theirs.", "This. Weddings are devolving into obnoxious expensive presents and cash grabs. Enough already. NTA op.", "You\u2019re right. In some communities, it\u2019s almost like we just bounce all the money around to whoever needs it at that particular time; engagement parties, weddings, baptisms, graduations etc etc we do it so we give enough that it covers the cost of us being there plus a cash gift. You get the same when it\u2019s your turn\u2026but almost $10K? If you can afford it and it\u2019s appropriate maybe but not if it isn\u2019t within your means financially.\n\n\nEdit: NTA !!", "And the cash is the wedding gift! You don't get both.", "Oh my\u2026haven\u2019t thought about dollar dances in years. It\u2019s pretty normal in my area but we decided against it. This was twenty years ago. We did a shot/dance with our guests. Take a shot with us then you dance with the bride or groom for a bit. It was our way of ensuring a little one-on-one time with the guests. Afterwards our maid of honor & best man (they were handing the shots out) handed us a stack of cash. lol Our guests took it upon themselves to have a dollar dance.", "My wedding was less than $300 and only lasted 2 years\u2026 this does not bode well for future relationships, because I don\u2019t know how much cheaper I could make a wedding", "Same. I just had to Google what it was.", "It was a thing growing up in south Louisiana.  It stopped being popular about 30 years ago, but maybe it\u2019s come back into fashion? Last time I saw one- it was about 20 years ago at a friend\u2019s wedding.  She was mortified about it, didn\u2019t want to do it, was scared no one would step up, but her mom raised all kinds of hell about it.  The idea of doing the money dance if you haven\u2019t grown up with it seems crazy to me. I didn\u2019t do it when I got married.  \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Someone else said nope, but sometimes the only other gifts were more sentimental/traditional items.", "I have only ever bought a dress and shoes. And those were pretty reasonable. \n\nShockingly enough, we were all capable of putting on our own make up and doing our own hair. \n\nHave i thrown many a shower as a bridesmaid? Yup.  Always at someone's house, and everyone made some food and got some drinks and some one fug out a box of shower decorations from a closet and you know, used stuff we own. People sit on folding chairs and visit and open presents and have fun and eat cupcakes.  And no one went into debt and no one had to take time off work and everyone had fun.", "And I doubt for all that time spent it'll even be as fun as a Bangladeshi wedding", ">\tI honestly think that social media and Pinterest have ruined wedding planning.\n\nYou are absolutely right. They have normalized rude behavior.", "Thanks!", "Exactly, this is insane, this must\u2019ve been from the insane laundry list of the Kardashians or Beyonc\u00e9 as her little daughter attends auction house events.", "Exactly! And gosh, I\u2019ve always wanted to go to a Bangladeshi or Indian wedding. They look incredible.", "I had the worlds oldest polka band.  On the plus side, they only cost $100, lol.", "We did ours at a library - it was a beautiful historic building overlooking a lovely park. The event space was $400!"]}
