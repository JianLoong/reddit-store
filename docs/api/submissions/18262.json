Why can't she do a small wedding in town and a desnation honeymoon like most people on a budget? If she can't afford fancy why the heck does she expect you to cover her wedding? Personally as I type this out it sounds like she doesn't want you as a maid of honor as much as she wants you to be her cash cow.

The wedding party\u2019s ONLY job is to show up for the wedding in the appropriate attire and stand next to the bride or groom.

Most people only give 1$ but you do get a few 5s and 10s maybe one or two 20s. Special person might give 50 or 100, but mostly a lot of 1s.\nThat being said, my generation is getting married now and a lot are skipping the dollar dance as it can be kind of tacky to ask guests for more money on top of travel to wedding, costs, and already generous gifts.
