I was raised with the rule that it\u2019s rude to even tell guests, \u201cIn lieu of gifts, please make donations to your favorite charity.\u201d  My mother said that saying that implies guest would otherwise give a gift, which one should never suggest to a guest at any event.

Out of 30+ weddings in five or six different states that I\u2019ve attended or been told extensively about/seen footage of, only like two have had the dollar dance, which I watched video footage of. So you can stand the fuck down with your highly exaggerated \u201cstatistic\u201d. It\u2019s highly dependent on your location and what culture you grew up in. If you grew up in the deep south among Creoles (edit: Louisiana specifically) your number makes more sense. But not for the majority of the country. The stat for the US overall is 50% or less, given that the statistic was provided by DJs, and not by the married couples themselves, and not every wedding uses DJ services.", "It's the \"stand the f down\"  for me with no facts, just anecdotal evidence. Because yeah, as I said on another one of your comments, I've even been to a Louisiana wedding and have made it 30 years with no idea what a dollar dance is.", "In the US the biggest chance for nonimmigrants would likely be Louisiana Creole populations, Polish-, Hungarian-, Balkan-, or Ukrainian-American communities, and likely Mexican-American (the ones I\u2019ve seen) communities.

Thank *you* for not being a rude asshole today, I hope today treats you well.", "Oh of course! You came armed with facts, and I always support the facts. Especially when they came onto your comment. I actually found this thread because they did the same thing on another post where I respomdd. Spouted out something as a fact and didn't back it up even a little so I was clicking through out of morbid curiosity. \n\nHell!
