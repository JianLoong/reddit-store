Him doing laundry for everything is not an issue. Except that you have stated your unease regarding it and requested her does nit do it, yet he continues to do so even though you do your own laundry. There is a simple answer to this though. Get a seperate laundry bag just for your underwear and keep it in a seperate area, like in a closet. Then do it yourself.

He intentionally goes into her room to do her laundry before she gets a chance, despite her saying she\u2019ll do her own laundry and doesn\u2019t want him doing this.

Put a small lock on the laundry hamper...?", "So, NTA. I find this kinda creepy, actually. I agree with someone else who said to separate out your undies and put them where they\u2019re not obvious. See if he looks for them or questions where they\u2019re at. If your mom dismisses his behavior, go to your school counselor and discuss this with them.", "Than you.\n\nTotally NTA!", "And he takes both hampers? Yeah, thats creepy as fuck.  Should tell all your family that he keeps doing it. If you feel violated, tell people.

I cried when he made those comments..", "I like running them on the gentler cycle as their fabric is more delicate. Also, some are hand wash only, and some require more steps (like removing cups/pads), so it's easier to do them separately.", "Gotchya. Still nta"]}
