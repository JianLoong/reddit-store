If he mistakenly sent it from his wife\u2019s account he needs to reimburse her from his account and he will be exactly where he intended to be\n3.

I mean, funny when it's not my phone blowing up. The stress would stop me sleeping.\n\nNTA. You checked. Three times.\n\nI'd be happiest if this was supposed to be some sort of scam - that they were fishing for your financial details - but anybody who scams a broke single mom is a complete idiot.\n\nBe aware that there may be an attempt to reclaim the money. If it had been his money, from the moment he told you \"it's a gift\", it was your money. The fact it's been declared that it was from his wife's account means it's less clear. If the account origin is his, though, it's completely not your problem. Even if he stole it from her, it doesn't mean it isn't now yours. Money is not like physical goods, like a painting etc. You can't be done for stolen goods when it's an electronic cash transaction. He took a thousand from her, and gave a thousand to you, but it's not the same money.\n\nThe fact they were rude and disrespectful is what's especially funny here. If you ever want to be treated well, paid back by someone, done a favor by service staff or a helpdesk, be \\*really nice\\*. Shouting obscenities doesn't help you.", "The money was given to you. You checked THREE TIMES. \nSo I\u2019d say at that point the money was yours to do with as you please.", "NTA - Hell no.  No takesy-backsy.  He sent it and you confirmed it three times with him.

Too bad.\n\nYou did exactly what you should have, it isn't your responsibility beyond verifying it was intended as a gift and to not send it back.  Too bad for him...should have made sure which account he was sending it from.", "NTA - You told him you couldn't accept it and he said it was a gift.  After that, it is not your responsibility.  He can't ask for it back now.  \n\n\nYou did nothing wrong.", "NTA. He's doing the hokey pokey with money.", "NTA. You double - and triple-checked, and he was clear that he was giving you the money.

OP, good lord, were you born yesterday? Why would a rando on the internet send you a thousand dollars? Why would you use this money immediately and not think anything of it? 10 bucks, maybe, a thousand? I hope this doesn't screw you over completely when he tries to get his bank to claw it back from you. (okay, maybe it isn't in USD because no one can be that naive, right?)", "I don't know, because then it relies on the recipient of the money (who desperately needs the money) to give back the money.\n\nAnd maybe I'm not as a nice person, but if I did all this, receive the money, and even try to say no no you don't have to and they keep telling me it's a gift, and then they ask for it back later cuz of their mistake.

Better off keeping the money and closing the cashapp account.  Start a new account later.", "I figured it was someone that wanted to do a good deed for the day.", "I've never heard of this either.\nToo bad he didn't tell his wife...if there is one.\n\nKeep the money !!\n\nNTA", "Report it to cash app and Facebook.

He was selling 4 brand new rims that he no longer needed.  He posted on FB and this guy agreed to buy them.  He sent my son $500.00 through PayPal, which was $200.00 over the amount my son was asking.  The man then turned around and told my son that he accidently sent too much and could he (son) reimburse him (buyer) the $200.00.  My son did and 5 business days later the bank issued my son an bounced check fee ($36.00) because the buyer's deposit was declined.  I wished my son had talked to me before he sent the buyer the $200.00 because that sounded like a scam.  I would have told him to wait until 5 day clearance from the bank before he sent any money.\n\nNTA but I really hope that this is legit for you since you already spent the money.", "https://reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/s/iIbKynQg2E", "That's the thing.  This woman probably isn't the only person they are scamming.  Sure he may not get the $1000 back from her, but it gets it back from the bank.  I'm sure there are other people out there where this has worked and the scammer gets double his money back.  To the scammer, it's all a numbers game."]}
