For example they got a small grocery cart with plastic groceries, and a train that can drive forward. They have been constantly fighting over the toys every single day since, because only one of the boys can play with the toy at a time. The cart is broken, because they kept fighting over it.

They may ask are they the only ones who aren't allowed to gift anymore, that answer would be yes, because they're the only ones to gift 2 kids with 1 toy, so in the future, no more gifts are necessary from the GPs.

Our older sister got a present and my twin and I had one to share that was equal to the cost of our sister's.  My dad told them to spend the same on all of us or buy nothing at all.

Grandparent got 1 toy and said \u201cfor x & y\u201d.  Other grandparent got 1 toy and also said \u201cfor x & y\u201d.

If kids were 3 and 4, they could very well still be having these very fights, unless the parents aren't going to have them share at all (it's not \"fair\" to expect them to?). They do need to learn and this is a prime age. Delaying it won't help them or their parents at all. Parents of more than one kid need to \"referee\", that's how kids work. Being weirdly jealous of a single 1yo that doesn't \"have to share\" when it's literally 1 kid at a different development stage in life in a different family situation is also sure something.", "Yep. I am in the midst of turn taking language with my two year old. We don\u2019t share in our house, we take turns. Of course the two year old throws a fit so we can either look around for something to play with until that other toy is free or we wait. She is learning but starting this mindset early is what teaches them. They don\u2019t just wake up as four year olds knowing how to negotiate play.", "They dont get a toy each though. They got a train from one set of grandparents to share. Then one shopping cart to share, from the other grandparents.", "I remember years ago reading about twin boys getting a joint present - they got a track suit. Not one each but one between them.

But that doesn't mandate duplicate/matching toys be given. We have young twins in the family too, and they get different gifts addressed to them specifically and always have.\n\nNOTE:  If you are saying that 2 families gave 1 gift each, then that's just odd and you can have that discussion.", "Thank you", "Ok that\u2019s different then. I could see it for something shareable like a playhouse or a Fisher Price kitchen or something. But not a train set. Even the shopping cart would be hard to share.", "Yeah, that makes a big difference to me too, compared to one set of grandparents buying 2 different toys for 2 kids.", "The problem is if Twin A gets a train set and Twin B gets a toy grocery cart, Twin A will be jealous of what Twin B got and vice versa. It\u2019s kind of a no win situation. It would be a lot easier for OP to teach the kids how to share and take turns. When my sister and I fought over toys, my parents took it away. OP\u2019s boys are at an age where they can learn consequences for their behavior.", "I think that is what needs clarification. I read it as each child is getting a separate gift, but OP wants them to be gifted the same gift.", "As I get it one set of grandparents gave the twins the train and another gave them the cart.", "No. Each set of grandparents bought one toy for the twins to share", "This is correct. My mom gave the cart, and the in-laws (the kids\u2019 grandma and grandpa) gave the train. Perhaps I should have stated that in my post.
