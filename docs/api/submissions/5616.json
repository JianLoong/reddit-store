Everyone at the dinner table starts gushing about their upcoming wedding and how he graduated salutatorian, blah blah blah. He now has a fancy job at a bank, and stepmom always goes out of her way to rub it in my face (I\u2019m still in school working on my doctorate so obviously I\u2019m dirt poor atm). I then reply that it\u2019s good for him he has his life all figured out, but because of how he\u2019s always treated me, he\u2019s not someone I care much for and therefore now have mutual indifferent feelings towards. Stepmom angrily demands I just let it all go but I then refused. It\u2019s not my job to have positive feelings for someone who couldn\u2019t care less about my existence.

She cannot force you to like someone, especially if that someone does not like you either. It's just what it is. She should let it go too!", "NTA he sounds like an insufferable ass, and your stepmom sounds like one too.", "NTA. It\u2019s not her place to tell you how to feel.", "NTA, but believe me, he doesn't have his life all figured out. \n\nWhere you end up is half chance and circumstances. \n\nEveryone has a plan until they get punched in the face, and life can deliver some damned good punches, especially when you're not expecting them.\n\nBy all means maintain your position, but don't let it drag you down or hold you back. \nDon't compare yourself to him and ignore those that do.\n\nJust live YOUR best life and continue to move forward.\nGood luck.", "You don\u2019t say where all this bad feeling got started. Do you not know?\n\nNTA as it stands, but it leaves me very curious.", "NTA: Stick to your guns!\n\nPeople should know by now not to put people on pedal stools. Oh wow salutatorian, so what? No one cares. I think getting a doctorate is much more impressive.", "YTA.  You sound jealous and competitive.  If you aren't interested in G, just be quiet when he's referenced.  You need to have a talk with yourself though about how his accomplishments don't make you less a worthy person.  \n\nPlus obligatory, no one has to hug anyone they don't want to.  We didn't even make our kids hug their grandparents.", "From your description it doesn\u2019t sound like anyone is comparing you but you. Talking about someone else\u2019s accomplishments isn\u2019t an insult to you. \n\nYTA just because it sounds like you are just jealous and creating drama where there doesn\u2019t have to be any.", "ESH except the cousins. You sound so jealous that your cousin has his life together while you don\u2019t. It\u2019s not his fault that your stepmom talks about him, it\u2019s not his fault that you got sad when he didn\u2019t want to have physical contact with you, and it\u2019s not his fault that he has friends that you don\u2019t want happening. Your stepmom is in the wrong IF she always talks about the guy and his achievements. You are in the wrong for being a judgmental asshole.", "NTA. But it really doesn\u2019t sound like anyone is comparing you too G but more like you\u2019re annoyed with the attention he gets from everyone else. Also who cares if your bio cousin hangs out with G and his fianc\u00e9 ? They have a better relationship then you do with him, would you expect your cousin to basically pick you over him? Becuse that\u2019s absurd.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
