No one cares. I think getting a doctorate is much more impressive.", "YTA.  You sound jealous and competitive.  If you aren't interested in G, just be quiet when he's referenced.  You need to have a talk with yourself though about how his accomplishments don't make you less a worthy person.  \n\nPlus obligatory, no one has to hug anyone they don't want to.

You sound so jealous that your cousin has his life together while you don\u2019t.

Your stepmom is in the wrong IF she always talks about the guy and his achievements. You are in the wrong for being a judgmental asshole.", "NTA. But it really doesn\u2019t sound like anyone is comparing you too G but more like you\u2019re annoyed with the attention he gets from everyone else. Also who cares if your bio cousin hangs out with G and his fianc\u00e9 ? They have a better relationship then you do with him, would you expect your cousin to basically pick you over him?
