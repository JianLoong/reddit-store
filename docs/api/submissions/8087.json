The main problem with our relationship is our financial differences. I make 90-100k and he makes 70-85k. He spends like he makes 200k+ in my opinion. But he thinks he spends like a normal person (maybe he does). I\u2019m pretty frugal bordering on cheap according to him. I think the difference comes from him being born and bred American white middle class and me being Vietnamese who immigrated at 11 and we had to struggle until I was in my early 20s.  \n\nMy lifestyle is pretty luxurious by Vietnamese standards but probably subpar to my salary by American standards. I own a nice SUV and my apartment in the city. But I don\u2019t eat out, I don\u2019t buy coffee, I make all my food from scratch. I have expensive hobbies like travel and biking but I don\u2019t even own a tv which my bf complains about a lot because even poor people own tvs. I don\u2019t own a dishwasher or air conditioner. I don\u2019t drink or smoke and I mostly drink tea or water. All my clothing and furniture is second hand. \n\nHe eats out 2-3 times a week, buys coffee at dunking donuts or Starbucks pretty much everyday. Rents a pretty expensive place because it has a dishwasher and air conditioner. I\u2019m so cheap (according to him) that I only have one subscription service Disney+ but he has 4 and pays $50 a month now. He owns more clothing than me. He still has student loans (way more than would be covered by loan forgiveness) and when he got a $5000 bonus last year I told him to put into a lump sum for his loans and he bought a new office chair and laptop setup. \n\nWe\u2019ve argued about it a few times. He thinks it\u2019s normal to live near paycheque to paycheque and only at my prompting now saves 10% of his income. I usually save 30-40%. That\u2019s even low compared to my parents who save 60-70%. I think it\u2019s because in Vietnam there isn\u2019t much of a safety net and if people don\u2019t have money or rich relatives they don\u2019t have other options. \n\nLast month his car broke down and the mechanic quoted him $4300 to fix. It\u2019s barely worth the cost of his car so he sold it for scrap. He has to take the bus which is now almost a 1.5h commute each way. So it\u2019s hard for him to get to work on him and he\u2019s late a lot. I work in the opposite direction so he doesn\u2019t have reliable transportation. He\u2019s asked me for $3500 for him to get a car. He has about $1500 saved and from scrapping his car. \n\nI don\u2019t want to lend it to him. I have the money and it wouldn\u2019t be a hardship to me to lend to him but I want this to change his money attitude. We are suppose to move soon and he agreed to pay half of my apartment expenses. Half the mortgage, utilities, condo fees which is $400 less than his rent now. I told him to use the savings to save up drop the extra spending and save up for a new car. Or get a loan. I told him already I\u2019m not helping. He\u2019s pissed because he know from prior conversations I have lots money saved and or invested and if we are moving in we are at the stage to help each other financially.", "created_utc": 1674499300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10jjwv1/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_bf_financially/", "score": 404, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The big problem here is that your bf is experiencing one of life's lessons - a cash flow problem - but it's not even that severe.  He still has a job, can afford food and has a roof.  The cause as you say yourself is he lives paycheck to paycheck.  \n\nI think whether you give him the money or not - I wouldn't either in this scenario - if you see a long term future with a marriage and maybe kids along the line in the years to come then you need to talk money.

There are several red flags here. \n\nMost people don't save 30-40% of their income (good for you), much less 60-70% so it's not realistic to expect anyone to meet your high saving standards.

He needs to buckle down and budget his income. He can get a loan from the bank and have a car payment.\n\nDo not help with huge purchases until you're married, unless you accept you'll never see that money again.", "NTA.

This won't be the last time he assumes he's entitled to your money.", "NTA  \nDO NOT combine your finances, EVER.  \nKeep everything separate and consider a pre-nup if you live in an area where they are legally binding.  \nIf he is going to live with you, make sure you have a rental agreement with him so he cannot claim any investment in your condo, if this is something that can happen where you live.", "i don\u2019t think you have compatible financial philosophies. personally i think it\u2019s NAH but he needs to budget more maturely and i\u2019m not sure you guys should be making your relationship more serious. this issue will stalk you for your entire lives, in every single facet of it.", "NTA.  Don't loan him the money.  if you really feel you need to help him out, give him a $1000 gift. He should be able to buy some sort of beater for 2500.\n\nAnd, for what it's worth, I don't see a bright future for the two of you. He is living beyond his means. And that's going to cause continuous friction between the two of you.\n\nBy the way, congratulations on your financial practices.", "NTA you two don\u2019t know each other well enough for you to be coughing up $3,500 in a loan that you will never see again. It\u2019s a omen if he can\u2019t afford the down pmt for the car he may not be able to afford the payments on the car.. stay away from his money woes and let him figure it out himself. And stop talking about your financials with this dude it\u2019s none of his business you aren\u2019t married and you may not be together long enough to have this matter but if you don\u2019t agree with how he handles his money why would you give him access to yours let along move in with him? If you give him a dime he\u2019s never going to stop asking for \u201cloans\u201d throughout the rest of this relationship.. you are right I\u2019m not giving him a penny.needless to say don\u2019t move in with this guy he is not financially responsible you will be paying for everything before you know it.", "NTA. You can probably treat yourself a little more, but he's a grown ass man. He was driving a car that was clearly on it's last leg and it never occurred to him that he might need a new one? He's behaving like a spoiled child. Don't loan him the money. Don't move in with him. It will only get worse.", "Nta, but if you are having disagreements about your financials after one year of dating, why are you moving in with him. \n\nFinancially, he's not compatible with you, not because of pay differences but because you both have two different philosophies regarding spending and saving. \n\nOnce you lend him money for his car, all you will become is an additional income source for his extravagant lifestyle.", "NTA. If you loan him money you will never get it back. You shouldn\u2019t move in with him either. He already feels he has a right to your income and it will only get worse once you live together. If he knows you can cover the bills he\u2019ll accidentally over spend and not be able to contribute and expect you to cover his half.", "That is a very important part of a relationship.  It sounds to me like neither of you agree on the topic at its fundamental level.  If your gut is saying don't lend him money, then don't lend him money.  He will only disappoint you.  YANTA!  He really isn't either.  It's just a matter of different styles of living.  I'd also go so far as to say look for someone else.  Someone that shares your values.  In the long run, it really matters.", "NTA - dont give him a cent.  Let him know why as well.", "NTA might want to consider someone closer to your lifestyle", "NTA do not give him any money he's using you if you give him anything he will just keep asking for more because \"girlfriend\"", "NTA  he is because he is going to want to live off of your income.", "NTA. He is not entitled to a dime of your money. He\u2019s just going to have to live scorched earth until he can get his finances in order and to buy his own car. You can offer to advise how he could cut down on his expenses and any sort of budgeting, but lending money will just enable. Can\u2019t he just take an earlier bus so he\u2019s not late to work?", "NTA\n\nThis is a big stumbling block and a good test for your relationship. \n\nDo you really want to spend more time - and live in the same space - as someone who will be pushing against and judging your (imo normal) lifestyle in favour of a more consumerist one?\n\nIs that really going to make you happy? Is this really what you want?\n\nBecause he's gonna be moving into this place you own without a tv, dishwasher or ac. You really sure you want a roomie like that?\n\nHow about prior to moving in, you and him sit down over a meal and go over your finances.\n\nIncome, expenses, statements, etc. Line by line.\n\nThen he can see how much he spends, and how much he actually has available if he knew how to budget.\n\nAs a first generation Canadian who has dated a few North American-born and raised white men of middle class origin, his lived experience has been very different. He does not understand hardship, limited finances, or lack of opportunity. It's just not something he'll have experienced enough of to get.\n\nAnd no, moving into YOUR APARTMENT YOU OWN is not \"in a position to financially help each other\". That's the line moochers use to leech money off others. I guarantee if you needed money he wouldn't give it to you.\n\nHelping him learn to budget is actually financially helping him. Giving him money is enabling him.", "NTA for not lending him the money, but this\n\n> I want this to change his money attitude\n\nis just so, *so* na\u00efve. \n\nAttitudes toward spending / saving money are really deep-seated, and *extremely* hard to change. Thinking this will change anything about his behavior in the future is unrealistic - especially because he doesn't see the need to change his attitude.  \n\nI don't think that the two of you will ever be compatible in terms of how you approach your finances.", "He is trying to use you. Do not allow it. Do not let him move in, do not loan him money. You will never get the money back.  In fact, dump him. You can do better.\nNTA", "This is your moment to stop and reevaluate before you make a serious mistake. You have different financial values and priorities. He is a liability. NTA.", "Money is one of the main reasons couples break up. If you both can't agree on expenses and spending habits, your cohabitation won't last 6 months, and you'll end up paying for all his debts. NTA. \n\nAnd living paycheque to paycheque is not normal, especially when you have the ability to save. It's what you do when you have no other choice.", "NTA. This is a recipe for financial abuse. He already feels entitled to spend your money and is not aware of how selfish he is. This kind of relationship sucks. Ask me how I know.", "NTA\n\nBut you do realize that when he moves in it will be YOU paying for everything", "NTA. Do not lend him the money and I would rethink this relationship. You have very different ideas of money management and I see you bailing him out again and again because he is your husband.", "Nta he's living way beyond his means", "NTA do not lend this person ANY money. you will never see it again\n\nyou're frugal, very.. but not *cheap*\n\nhe's irresponsible. blatantly wastefully foolishly irresponsible.  you should not be paycheck to paycheck almost anywhere in the US at $100k\n\nand I say that as someone who makes nearly $200k\n\ni encourage you to find someone more financially compatible with you", "NTA\n\nDon't let him move in.", "NTA.  Never loan money to family or friends - or romantic partners.  If you can\u2019t afford to just give it, don\u2019t do it.  OP, rethink this relationship.  One of the biggest causes of breakups - dating and marriage - is financial.  The two of do not have similar financial habits or goals.  You are opposite ends of the spectrum.  You\u2019re not going to be able to make this work the way you both are now.", "His poor decisions should not become your problem, which they will if you move in together. Give him a timeline to get out of debt and if he can't/won't you should move on. This won't get better with time. NTA", "NTA\nTo be honest you should seriously rethink this relationship. If he\u2019s spending his money this way now, how do you think he\u2019a gonna be if you two end up getting married and have a shared account?\nI\u2019ve cut ties with exes when they cannot get their spending habits under control and live beyond their means without understanding that they have a problem. \nI\u2019m no therapist but this is a huge red flag. If he thinks it\u2019s normal to live paycheck to paycheck while making 70-80k then he\u2019s in for a world of trouble in the future.\nDoes he have anything setup for retirement or does he think he\u2019s gonna be making the same or more money when he\u2019s 60+?\nComing from an Asian household myself we know how to save and prepare for the future. My student loans were the first thing I paid off even though it was a struggle.\nGood luck!", "NTA. Don\u2019t lend him the money. He will start to expect it from you every time something goes wrong. He\u2019ll start using you as \u2018his savings\u2019 rather than actually save money. If he was someone who was money smart and ended up in a struggle then yes. But this guy constantly lives beyond what he can afford and expects you to cover his ass when it goes wrong. NO. \n\nNot to mention the fact that it seems this car situation hasn\u2019t taught him anything as you are still having to suggest to him to save for the car and reduce expenses.\n\nAlso don\u2019t move in with him. He is not financially responsible enough and he most likely won\u2019t be able to afford it long term if he doesn\u2019t change and he\u2019ll end up being a financial burden on you. You saved and worked hard you get to enjoy that money in however way you see fit and don\u2019t let him decide that for you. He clearly isn\u2019t in a position to give advice.\n\nAlso we aren\u2019t talking about a person on a low/ minimum wage salary. So there really isn\u2019t a \u2018bread winner\u2019 situation - his bad habits led him to this. He has a good job and can afford to live financially stable. Being money smart requires you to be self aware and self motivated to learn because it requires a life style and habit change. Do you think he has that in him? You aren\u2019t the parent you don\u2019t need to be constantly parenting him to save?", "THIS.  LISTEN TO THIS!", "Actually from my read, OP already owns the condo. BF would just begin to contribute towards the costs once (if) he moves in", "While he's on the mortgage as co-owner of the condo! TERRIBLE situation in the making!", "Not sure that she's putting him on the mortgage or title. Definitely don't put him on the title."]}
