The problem is we already made these plans, spent money, and other people have made plans based on us going as well.

If they can\u2019t I totally understand if you want to see your friends but it would be rude for me not to go to this weekend we planned.", "Why dont you ask him ow he feels about rescheduling and see if its an issue. If its no issue for him then its a problem over nothing. If it is a big issue for him then it makes sense", "So she doesn\u2019t either. I\u2019m going with NTA because you are accommodating her, and she is simply dismissing you. If time is the only reason both of you aren\u2019t seeing these people, the first plans are the plans. Distance is the only tie-breaker.", "Because her friends aren't just \"in town\" they all live in the same town so it's not like a one off visit where they won't be able to reschedule.", "Because I don't want to reschedule and shouldn't have to.

Why does the compromise have to include rescheduling with my friends when we had already made the plans before my gfs friends?\n\nWhy should the compromise not be my gf telling her friends she sorry but forgot she had plans that weekend but would like to rearrange when they're meeting up?", "OP isn\u2019t being unreasonable at all. The plans with OP\u2019s friends were made first so those plans should take priority. All OP\u2019s gf had to do was tell them she can\u2019t make it on that date and suggest they pick another date. If they all live in the same city, it shouldn\u2019t be that hard to find a different date that works for everyone.", "Cause that\u2019s not a compromise, that\u2019s you getting your way. A compromise is both parties being willing to sacrifice a little for the greater good of each other. What is the harm in both of you calling your respective friends and seeing if a rescedule is possible?\n\nIt seems you are more concerned with soothing your ego because we are giving you solutions and all you want is your way or the highway.", "Well that\u2019s your opinion. It sounds like ops girlfriends are getting together a bigger group than 2 couples and rescheduling could disrupt many peoples plans. Vs calling one couple and asking \u201chey you free next weekend?\u201d, one just sounds easier. I\u2019m not saying ops girlfriend was justified just saying op does not seem willing to compromise.", "How is me rescheduling with my friend so my gf can see her friends not just my gf getting her way then? \n\nAgain it's got nothing to do with ego and its bizarre you keep bringing it up. If you make plans with someone its shitty to cancel the second something else comes along", "Just because OP\u2019s friend and his gf are only two people doesn\u2019t mean their time is less valuable and OP shouldn\u2019t respect it. OP is willing to compromise. They said they were still going to see their friend as planned and their gf could stay behind and see her friends. She wants them to reschedule. If she misses her friends so much she shouldn\u2019t mind attending this get together solo. OP isn\u2019t forcing her to go with them.", "It\u2019s not canceling, it\u2019s rescheduling. IF YOU BOTH CALL BOTH FRIENDS AND EVERYONE ATTEMPTS A RESCHEDULE THEN THAT IS A COMPROMISE OMG HOW DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND? SOMETIMES WE DONT GET OUR WAY. YOUR WILLFUL IGNORANCE SEEMS LIKE EGO PROTECTION.", "I missed that part I guess. Still tho I guess I would just handle this differently", "Yet again bringing ego into it when it is not relevant. And using all caps doesn't make your point suddenly correct.\n\nUsing your example if I had plans with my gf to go on a date and my friends wanted to meet up, I'd be completely fine telling my gf the date will have to happen another day because I've made other plans?", "You don't understand what a compromise is", "NTA. Does she demand priority in every aspect of your life?", "NTA. This just shows that she values her friends and time more than she values your friends and time.

Let them know what came up and IF a later time would work for them. The purpose of the call is to make sure their friendship feels valued and appreciated, life isn\u2019t always simple and people understand that. It would also give your gf a chance to explain herself, to your friend and his girl, why this is important to her.\n\nI think your both being stubborn but that\u2019s normal for a young couple.

She\u2019s the unreasonable one and rather rude I\u2019d say.", "Tip: don't marry the GF. \n\nShe sounds like she doesn't care about your needs, just hers. Very selfish and manipulative. Nice bit of DARVO by telling you that you were the one creating the argument. she is the one causing the argument. \n\nStick to your boundaries OP. And look out for any other signs of selfish behaviour from your GF.", "NTA, but she is. She had no right to blithely make plans with her friends after she already had plans with you. She didn't even discuss it with you first. She is absolutely TA.", "NTA, I get she hasn\u2019t seen her friends in awhile but neither have you. You already made the double date plans awhile ago she should\u2019ve talked to you about it before giving her friends an official answe", "NTA. No.  SHE's being unreasonable.  You made a prior commitment.  It was completely wrong of her to just ignore it in favor of her friends.", "INFO: is there a reason you can\u2019t go on your own to see your friend and she can go on her own to see her friends?", "NTA. \n\nYou already had plans, and she doesn't get to simply overrule that. She can bow out if she wants, rude, but she can't command your attendance.", "I agree with you on the communication and mutual respect. That OP is looking for validation here instead of asking for actual relationship advice on moving forward is telling. Relationships shouldn't be about pointing fingers at who is right and wrong. Also thanks for the popcorn haha.\n\nEdit: oh wait, popcorn was from u/legitimate_ninja_993", "I would agree with you maybe if she had brought it up to him BEFORE she told her friends yes. If she had said, we have a prior commitment,  but I'll see if it can be changed, then that's reasonable. She just agreed and told him to change the plan.", "OP would like to, but his gf wants him to cancel and go with her.", "You made a commitment,  and now you stick with it. People like your GF that are flaky with their plans are the worst. Good for you for sticking to the original plan and honoring your agreement to meet up.", "Hi, coming over from relationship sub, and I'm surprised you posted here too. When I see people post in r/amitheasshole about relationship problems, it usually is about ego. Plus you are only arguing back to those calling you YTA instead of responding to people giving you relationship advice.\n\n It's good to be firm and have good boundaries, but you are also in a relationship. Either break up, or work together. I'm not saying you need to compromise, but instead of focusing on being right and wrong, focus on being a team about it so that you two aren't hating each other from all the cold and resentment."]}
