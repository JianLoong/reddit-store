I do understand her frustration, and with family, especially younger kids that don't really \"get\" social conventions, it's hard - maybe you can do something else with your nieces another time, compromise like that? I think in this situation it's probably less helpful to think of who's \"right\" and more useful to look at all of the different emotions in play. there's no good answer here where no one will get hurt, save for her kids suddenly learning social rules that they probably wont actually understand for a while longer.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you won\u2019t have kid spittle on your cake, which is a solid win!\n\nKids will either be taught boundaries or they won\u2019t, but you are fully entitled to exercise yours.", "NTA.

I would understand if you didn't want kids at your birthday because it wasn't going to be age-appropriate. That would be normal, I think, I wouldn't expect a 22 year old's birthday party to be kid-friendly. The reason YTA is because this is about the candles.

No one wants to listen to a screaming child any day, least of all on their birthday and at 7 that kid should know better than to blow out someone else\u2019s candles when it\u2019s not her birthday (I\u2019m just assuming it\u2019s the 7 year old as the other one is 2 and probably can\u2019t blow out candles lol).

You\u2019re an adult and they\u2019re your nieces, is you not getting to blow a little flame out really that deep? It\u2019s not like she\u2019s stealing or ruining your presents or something.. you do know you don\u2019t actually get a wish every time you blow the candle, right?", "Kids gonna be kids, but it\u2019s your sister\u2019s job to teach them that this is inappropriate and that your birthday is not about them.

Is blowing out candles REALLY the best part of your birthday every year?", "YTA who the f cares about blowing out candles at 21?", "NTA but if this is a family party, you are being very exclusionary. Especially if there are any other younger kids there.\n\nPerhaps for this year you should consider not having a birthday cake at all at this particular party...  and doing the cake with your friends.  \n\nThat takes away the potential angst of what is going to happen when your niece has a hissy fit (and so does your sister)... because the reality is that the kids are going to be there because the rest of the family will wear you down about excluding the kids.\n\nShould you have to do this... no... but it depends on whether the potential ramifications of excluding them is worth it.  She'll probably gate crash anyway.\n\nYour sister is raising an entitled brat who doesn't appear to be getting any guidance about what is acceptable when you interact with others.\n\nAnd next year just celebrate your birthday with a party just for your friends.   You can just have dinner with your parents to celebrate rather than a party including the whole family.", "Agree! Plus who's gonna wanna eat the cake with kid spit all over it", "Both excellent choices. \nI came here to say do it at the kids party also. \nBut the adult in me tells me to talk to the kids, not the sister, and tell them it\u2019s not okay before the cake comes out. But if they do.. game on", "This is not child like. Children who are properly parented respect people's moment. \n\nThe sister found it normal that says she is not teaching thus kids what they are doing is wrong.", "Doesn\u2019t matter the house, it\u2019s still OP\u2019s birthday.

It\u2019s pretty unfortunate for the kids but that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen if they\u2019re left to do whatever they want. Ideally you\u2019d be able to say to your sister that she needs to stop her kids from doing that if she wants to be able to bring them, but given how she responded to your dad I can\u2019t see that going down well."]}
