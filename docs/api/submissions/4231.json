Why do I get the impression that you tell kids they are too old to be trick or treating too?", "Exactly. Kids are going to push boundaries because sometimes they fixate on getting away with something. But parents need to jump in there and make it a fixed boundary so they learn not to push it.", "It's about the kid's behavior. What stops this kid from deciding those are her present Apparently not her parents.", "But see.... I don't think it's the 2 year old doing this. *That* would make more sense. But OP says \"for the last 2 years.\" That means it's the **7 year old** doing this. \n\nOP's sister needs to parent their damn kid. NTA, OP.", "First thing I thought of. Give the kid a taste of her own medicine.", "Yeah, it\u2019s so weird that parents think that kids just magically stop doing bad behaviour one day, rather than thinking that maybe they might change because a loving adult teaches them a better way of being", "I saw it last year at a friend's daughter's birthday party. The parents seem very nice but acknowledged that the paternal grandparents provide a lot of childcare and basically give the kid whatever he wants. \n\nThe end result is that the kid is sorta a menace. He needs constant adult supervision and if he doesn't have it- there will be some sort of disaster.\n\nWhen it came to the cake, he blew out the candles. They had to be relit and he had to be restrained to prevent him from blowing them out again.", "Me too- all these responses were seriously freaking me out.", "Does your niece have friends her own age who invite her to their birthday parties? Does she blow out their candles too?", "Lol I\u2019m trying to imagine a baby just a few months old getting to the cake on her own, blowing the candles out, and knowing what it is to blow out the candles without ever even having a birthday yet. It\u2019s a funny picture in my head. It\u2019s definitely the 7 year old doing it.", "Well, now it's actually a viable option. LOL!", "Omg that would be pro revenge \ud83d\ude02 the kids would be left speechless", "That actually sounds adorable.  I hope you got that recorded. (It\u2019s cute when help is asked.)", "I honestly don\u2019t know anyone over the age of 21 who is so fixated on the experience of blowing out candles.", "Well the neiece was most likely doing it without permission. So that could be annoying."]}
