Cake fight 2. Blowing out my candles 3. Hiding all the presents at a place too high to get 4. Calling me into the kitchen for a quick \u201ccool down\u201d with the sprayer 5. Acting like he was gonna steal bites of my cake 6. Promised me an energy drink right before I left. I think it\u2019s super important for kids to have an aunt/uncle who does fun pranks like that. I think that\u2019s fine so long as ultimately the kids are safe, but they don\u2019t learn without consequences.
