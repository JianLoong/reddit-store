My dad died from cancer when I was 8. I was a real daddy's girl so it broke my heart and is probably why, no matter how loving and kind my stepdad is, he will never be able to earn the title of dad or take an equal place in my heart or life. And my stepdad is a lovely person. He wanted to be a second dad to me. We discussed this in therapy when I was a kid. He said he would love to have a dad title and nickname and he would love for me to embrace him as the dad my dad sent to me when he couldn't be there. It was during that whole discussion that I revealed dad wouldn't have sent me another dad, because he even said he would be my only dad, in one of our last full conversations, when I was really sad about losing him and I felt nobody understood. My mom and stepdad wanted to know if that was the reason I didn't want to call my stepdad a dad name and let him in as much as I did my dad. I told them even without that I wouldn't have wanted a new dad.\n\nWe came out of therapy where not everyone was entirely happy. My stepdad was unhappy that he would never hear me call him anything other than my stepdad or his name and that I would not want to work on building a father/daughter relationship with him that would be like what a normal father/daughter relationship would be. I was unhappy that in compromise, I would not correct and they would never correct people who mistook him for my dad and would say it to us. But I had to give something and that was my part of the compromise.\n\nEven though my stepdad has four bio kids with my mom now, he still feels a loss that we don't have what he wanted us to have. I love my stepdad. But it's very different from the love I have for my parents. It's closer to the love I have for my uncles honestly. And when my fianc\u00e9 and I started wedding planning I knew the whole walk me down the aisle/father daughter dance would be an issue. So my fianc\u00e9 and I planned something more unique. An immediate family dance. For me it would mean one big dance with my mom, stepdad and my siblings. With my fianc\u00e9 it would be his parents, grandparents (who lived in the same house as him growing up so were immediate family) and siblings.\n\nI asked my mom and stepdad if they would like to take part in the dance. My stepdad asked what about the father/daughter dance. I said this would be in place of that, so the whole family could take part. He told me he wanted the father/daughter dance. That he wanted a special moment for just the two of us. I told him I would rather the dance with us all and no father/daughter dance. We had already discussed that I would be walking down the aisle with my fianc\u00e9 so he was incredibly frustrated and upset that I didn't want a father/daughter dance. He and my mom told me I was wrong. They told me I should do the father/daughter dance and stop trying to come up with anything but.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701274518, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/186t5sp/aita_for_asking_for_a_family_dance_instead_of_a/", "score": 962, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I knew my stepdad would want a father/daughter dance. And I knew I didn't want it. So I figured out a compromise.

That's ridiculous.\n\nYou've said you love your stepfather but that he will never be a replacement for your father, and that is perfectly understandable and acceptable. This man also has FOUR biological kids of his own. The fact that he is STILL pushing your boundaries and demanding \"fatherly\" ceremonies **sixteen years** into your relationship is INSANE.\n\nHe really needs to get over himself and focus on being the ACTUAL father of his four biological children and let the 27 year old mature adult live her life.\n\nI think the \"family dance\" is an awesome compromise to include everyone and enjoy your day. Good for you for coming up with the idea. Anyone who doesn't like it can pound sand, frankly. It is you and your fiancee's day.", "NTA\n\n\nIt's not for them to decide which dance you have, and it's certainly very unfair if they try and get you to do something you aren't comfortable with.\nThis sounds like they are going to cause issues. \nIt's probably best to be firm and nip it in the bud so they don't keep trying to argue and essentially ruin what should be a special time(planning your wedding)", "NTA. If your stepdad really was loving, he would\u2019ve respected your boundaries during your childhood and been happy with whatever you decided to do during your wedding. \n\nDance with whomever you want.", "\"..he would love for me to embrace him as the dad my dad sent to me when he couldn't be there.\"\n\nThis is so gross. I can't imagine trying to emotionally manipulate a grieving child like this. Nothing wrong with trying to build a relationship and pledging to love a stepchild, but this statement, implying that dad can be replaced and is okay with being replaced, is invalidating and distasteful. It's good that you were able to move past this and love him, though.\n\nNTA for the family dance at all. Hopefully he can see it for the gesture it is.", "NTA. You've made your boundaries clear. If your mom and step-dad continue to going you, demote then to a guest or even uninvited them. They've had years to respect your feelings and boundaries, if they won't respect it now, let them know that they are ruining their relationships with you and there isn't a coming back from that.", "I think E S H *except* you. NTA by far.\n\nChildren should always take the lead when it comes to relationships with stepfamily members. The only thing that should be required of a child when it comes to any sort of step relationship is basic respect.\n\nI can\u2019t think of anything more manipulative than telling a young child that their deceased parent sent their new stepfather into their lives to be their new dad. That mindset should have been dismissed immediately. \n\nBoth your stepfather and your mother are at fault for trying to convince you of that belief, and they are both at fault for making you feel guilty for wanting something different than their dream scenario.\n\nI\u2019m adding the next part as gently and tactfully as possible: if the healthy thing to do is to allow children to decide their relationship to stepfamily members on their own terms then I think your father telling you that he would always be your only father was also an unhealthy choice. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean I think your dad was a bad person or trying to guilt or manipulate you. I am not comparing your conversation with your father to the obviously and intentionally harmful actions of your mom and stepdad. It simply means that I think your father was in a horrible, emotionally charged position and make choice that wasn\u2019t the best.\n\nI absolutely believe you when you say that you would have felt the way you do regardless of that conversation with your father. I also think that any chance of a loving, parental like relationship goes out the window the second someone uses a deceased family member to emotionally manipulate someone. \n\nHowever, I also think that conversation shaped your relationships going forward. I think deciding who and how to love when it came to caregivers should have been your decision alone.\n\nI hope that final comment doesn\u2019t take away from the main A\u2019s here: your mother and stepfather. The fact that your relationship with both is as close as it is (even if it\u2019s not what they want) is a testament to you.\n\nI would used this opportunity to think about if their reaction to this is part of a pattern of emotional manipulation and how you want your relationship with both of them to look moving forward.", "Yeah mom and step dad are so very wrong. He\u2019s not nice if it\u2019s always about him, his feelings and what he wants. This is emotional blackmail. You were the kid and even though you\u2019re an adult you\u2019re still the kid in this family dynamic. You have been honest and overly accommodating to people that don\u2019t seem to care about what\u2019s right for you and how you\u2019re feeling. You are not in charge of their happiness. Do not feel bad if you need to be firmer with establishing boundaries. What about how you feel? Why do your needs not matter? Is this not your wedding?", "NTA\n\nYou made your boundaries clear that no one will ever replace your late father. They need to respect your decision.\n\nIt's your wedding and you can do it however you want.", "NTA, but this is close to NAH.  You may never see him as a father figure, but that doesn't mean he doesn't view you as his daughter and that this whole situation probably hurts him.  He doesn't get to tell you that you are wrong for what you want to do with your wedding (emphasis on \"your wedding\").  That's where he's an AH.  \n\nPerhaps it might be nice to acknowledge him somehow, though.  You don't have to acknowledge him as your dad, but somehow, publicly acknowledge him that you appreciate all he's done for you since he's come into your life.  He's not your dad and never will be, but he WAS there to help raise you and love you like one of his own.", "NTA. Your stepdad is allowed to want to be looked at as your dad, he's allowed to feel sad that you don't see him that way.\n\nHe's not allowed to force you to see him that way against your will. Its been 16 years it's time he accepts how you feel and starts respecting it.", "NTA\n\nThe family dance is a wonderful compromise that should make everyone happy and honors your stepdad as well as your mother and the rest of your family. The fact that your stepdad can't just stfu and be grateful that he is included at all is wild and selfish.\n\nIt's ok that he is disappointed and sad. His feelings are valid and understandable. But trying to force this on you and change your mind is not ok.", "NTA\n\nThis is your wedding. What he wants is irrelevant.\n\nAttempting to force you to call him dad, and claiming he wants to be your dad, and have that relationship with you, only a couple years after you lost your father is probably a big reason why you never grew to do so. Literally every movie and show we have now has the stepparent telling the little kid, \"I will never replace your parent\" and what not, because that's how you speak to kids and allow them to emotionally grow.\n\nYou don't attempt to force them to accepting a relationship they aren't ready for. You don't force them to lie to strangers because HE wants to and because it would make HIM uncomfortable. They really fumbled the ball with you as a child, and that's their fault.", "Great reason to avoid step-children. They have everything figured out.", "NTA. I honestly cant with this step parents who want to force some kind of bond that simple doesnt exist, or at least doesnt exist from the step-kid -> step parent pov.\n\nIts ok for him to want this dance, its not ok for him to demand it. Like it was not ok for him to keep insisting in having a dad name. This is not something you can insist on. Its something that can only come from love.\n\nYou have a father. Sadly, he cant be here to walk you down the aisle and dance with you. Its your wedding, you get to decide how you wanna play it. This family dance seems very nice because you will include all the people you consider family, including the step father. Time for him to realise he cant push his wants into you.", "NTA at all. I\u2019m disgusted your parents are trying to force someone in your life to that extent. You don\u2019t have to see him as a father figure and you don\u2019t have to feel bad about it. You were a child who lost your dad and the remaining adults around you cared more about their emotions than yours", "NTA. Your feelings are your feelings and no one can force you to feel different feelings to spare their own feelings. There, I just used \u201cfeel\u201d five times in one sentence. That surely proves my point! I thought you were considerate, empathetic, and intentional with your alternative plans. You included your entire family without giving away your father\u2019s place in your heart/mind. \n\nIf this is upsetting your mom/stepdad, then this was never about finding a way forward as a family in whatever sense worked for everyone. This was only about one man\u2019s need to be and feel important. Now, his literal last hope to serve a role you\u2019ve made clear you don\u2019t want him to serve has slipped through his fingers. And, that point is going to be demonstrated at a public affair, your wedding. This is all on him and your mother. They did therapy with you. They know how you feel and have since you were a child. The fact that they are still pushing an attachment and feelings that you do not have in you to give to this man, makes them inconsiderate, pushy, assholes themselves.", "NTA  \n\n\nIt is YOUR wedding, and nobody but you and your fiance have any say on how YOUR wedding goes.\n\nWhen going into feelings, I understand why your stepdad would feel hurt, but I also understand that you still love him despite not viewing him as your dad. Both of you are valid in your feelings. However, as I said, it's your wedding, and you and your fiance are the only ones who have a say in how your wedding goes.

My father was a very loving man and so was my stepfather which is lucky for me because my mother wasn't. I cherish the only time I called my stepfather dad.

You seem to genuinely care about your stepdad and appreciate that he stepped in to fill the parental role even if it never felt like he was your dad. Given that you have a good relationship with him (dance thing notwithstanding), I assume he did lots of \"dad-like\" stuff along the way, like trick or treating, driving you to practices, helping with homework, whatever it was in your case. And that does deserve some acknowledgement. But you were also clear from the very beginning that \"Father\" was a boundary, and frankly, an understandable one.\n\nHe's allowed to feel the sting of that boundary, and it likely DOES sting. But I can't help but wonder if you might feel a little more accommodating of the dance now if he hadn't also made clear over the years that he wanted that last step you couldn't take. If you gave him 90% of what he was hoping for but couldn't do the 10% and were clear about that, then he should have dropped it and not brought it up again. If he had, who knows? Maybe you'd be fine with Stepfather/daughter dance. But it has continue to be \"a thing\" it seems, so why would you give now?\n\nWhich brings me back to the therapist. You say, \"I had to give something and that was my part of the compromise.\" I disagree. I don't think an 8yo (or 10yo or 12yo or whenever the therapy was) who lost her father to cancer has to compromise one bit on whether she has to call someone else her father. Show the parental figure in the house appropriate respect? Yes. Abide by reasonable rules he and your mom agreed on? Yup. Stepparents get a say. But unless you're framing this really favorably to yourself, you were doing that to a reasonable degree, and you were pushed into a compromise on someone being called your father. That feels wrong, or at least premature, and like it stiffened your back on the issue for good, hence no chance of softening now on a (presumably) one-time event.\n\nGiven that it IS presumably a one-time thing, I also get why he feels the sting of not getting to walk you down the aisle or dance with you. Even if it was called the stepfather dance to make it clear, if he was actually a caring, good parent from 8 to 18 (or whatever you want to call an adult), I can see thinking, \"Am I ever going to just get the tip of the cap without being treated like the interloper who can't measure up?\" That doesn't mean you owe it to him! But it does mean there are no AHs here. It's just a shitty situation because family is an emotional minefield, and the loss of a parent to cancer when so young just adds more mines.\n\nWhatever you decide to do, good luck with the wedding!

When their relationship ended and my mom started to date my now step dad I told her in no uncertain terms I would never play happy families and call another man dad not ever.

You get to decide what kind of relationship you have with your stepdad. It\u2019s very clear that you love and respect him as a member of your family. That is all that is needed. While he might have wanted a closer relationship with you and to be your \u201cdad\u201d that desire didn\u2019t go both ways. However he can still love and respect you in the way you do him. It\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t though. the fact he feels entitled to a father/daughter dance shows this. Even the fact you weren\u2019t allowed to correct anyone who called him your dad shows this. I personally find it creepy when stepdads want these close relationships with their stepdaughters. It\u2019s one thing to accept your significant others child into your life but a whole other thing to be so vocal about wanting to be their dad. \n\nI think you need to truly sit down and think about if you want to do this family dance because you wanted to avoid this conflict over a father daughter dance or if it\u2019s really something your and your fianc\u00e9 would want even if your dad was still around. It sounds like a nice gesture and could be very cute. My thoughts though are that those are more for when parents are blending families and it\u2019s going to be obvious that you planned it because you lost your father. \n\nI also lost my dad and my mom has been with someone for almost 20 years now. He\u2019s wonderful. While they aren\u2019t married I call him my stepdad. I know that he will be there for me no matter what, he\u2019s currently going through cancer treatment and I\u2019m there for him. But I also know that if I ever get married my mom would walk me down the aisle or I\u2019d walk down alone and I\u2019d either have a dance with her or want no dance at all. You only need to worry about what you and your fianc\u00e9 want in a wedding. You can have all the traditional things or none. Do not feel like you need to give into your stepdads wishes. \nPlease though if you and up having kids do allow them to call him grandpa and have that bond with him. My niece is currently 6 and her relationship with my stepdad is amazing! She knows that grandpa isn\u2019t mom\u2019s dad and that grandma and grandpa aren\u2019t married. She knows that \u201cgrandpa Larry\u201d is an angle. He got really really sick and died.

My mother is so happy I have the love of a mother close by and she would love one day to come visit and meet this lady who has taken care of her kid and grandkids. This has not diminished my mother\u2019s relationship and importance in my life one iota. Just as we love many of our children the same way, I feel like you can love and respect and appropriately honour different parents without diminishing either relationship.

But that therapist did you *and* your stepfather an *incredible* disservice. \n\nI am so, so sorry that three *grown ass adults* told a child who lost her father that she now had to publicly erase him from her life. And to add insult to injury, *you had to lie to do it.* A lie by omission, but a lie nonetheless. \n\nThe incredibly ironic thing is, if not for that compromise, you might have grown to love your stepfather in a way that is much closer to what he wanted if they hadn\u2019t done that. \n\nI\u2019m so proud of you for never letting them completely take your dad away from you.", "You're NTA at all, but I also think setting your expectations is important here.

My parents divorced when I was a baby, and my mom married my stepdad when I was six. I see and love him as my dad just as much as my biological dad. But, obviously I still have my bio dad around, so the trauma of losing a parent can definitely hinder a new step-parent relationship, even if they are really good to you, which it seems like this man is. OP even said so. Same thing with my nephew, and his mother got married when he was around 10, so a little older and definitely remembers his dad (who is no longer part of his life). He even calls his stepdad \u201cdad\u201d now, which he didn\u2019t in the beginning. It\u2019s almost as much of a roll of the dice situation as it is putting in the effort to be a good bonus parent. It\u2019s up to the child entirely. I found this really sad to read, and I hurt for the step-dad. Yeah, he said some things he shouldn\u2019t have, like their dad sent him to be a new dad, but that very much could have been him trying to comfort OP and it just backfired because of bio dad\u2019s words. I don\u2019t believe it was meant to be manipulative. He just wants a small portion of reciprocated paternal love and respect that he\u2019s been giving OP for over 20 years now.\n\nEdited for spelling", "Exactly! No matter how long he has been there he doesn't get to replace OPsdad. It would be totally different if she lost her dad as a baby and didn't know him or have the relationship they did. But he was/ is a very real part of who she is. The fact that she and her dad had a deep and loving conversation about how he felt about his passing, should mean something to her mother. She needs to tell them both that they can either get on board or they can just stay home. She won't be pushed to do something that she is not comfortable with just so he can show off to everyone in attendance,  how\n \" important \" he is. He needs to stop trying to compete with a ghost..", "You made that choice, gave that love freely. Love is great, but we can't choose who we feel it for, and in what way entirely. OP does love her stepdad, but being pressured into loving them in a specific way doesn't equal actual love, just obligation.", "Aww, that's great to hear!", "Yes! Family relationships are always difficult, especially in cases like this. I believe that the issue of expectations and what someone desires in their life is important because, in this case, OP always made their boundaries clear, which is healthy and correct. However, I can understand the stepfather and his feelings. It's not a rational issue but an emotional one, wanting that love to be reciprocated... but knowing for years that it won't be. \n\nI think that's why if someone wants to be a parent and comes across a situation like OP's, they should seriously consider if it's worth tying themselves emotionally.", "Sarcasm doesn't usually work for the ultra lame AITA commenters.", "I guess that\u2019s true, just a sad way to look at it. One of those situations where you may love someone so much, but you just aren\u2019t compatible for reasons beyond the relationship of just two people, no matter how hard you\u2019ve tried to make it work. Just like knowing you shouldn\u2019t be together if one of you wants kids and the other definitely doesn\u2019t. Or that you\u2019ve always wanted to pursue your dream job that takes you abroad, but your partner is a firm homebody that likes to stay close to their family.\n\nI don\u2019t blame the stepfather almost at all in this situation. In my opinion, the parents did everything they could to try and make this a comfortable situation for OP and OP just wasn\u2019t receptive to it. Sure, parents are people too and will make mistakes or say the wrong thing, but I do believe OP is not putting in enough effort here. While the stepdad could have looked at this situation years ago and said yeah, she\u2019ll never love me back and for that I should just stop trying, he didn\u2019t. And because of that, OP should\u2019ve tried a little harder themselves to form a better relationship with him. The only effort on their part was to not correct others that didn\u2019t know the situation when they called stepdad OP\u2019s dad. As a kid, I understand completely. But they\u2019re an adult now and that is just barely a mustard seed of empathy for stepdad\u2019s situation. I guess the \u201cfamily dance\u201d is better than none at all if they really want it, but still a knife in the stomach to SD and they should be more sympathetic to that. There\u2019s a way to honor both bio dad and SD in this situation, at least for all the effort he has put in, and OP chose instead to just rub a little more salt in his wound.\n\nI know it\u2019s their wedding, and a common agreement among most people is that absolutely no compromises for your wedding, but the lack of care for another person\u2019s feelings is very upsetting. Especially since OP knows, this man is a good man.", "Whew, sorry this all became so long. I just don\u2019t feel like all the NTA verdicts are warranted. At the very least I think ESH, with it mostly being OP and not the parents. They shouldn\u2019t push, and OP should recognize that even if they don\u2019t view SD as a parent, he has been for most of OP\u2019s life, a good one at that, and he deserves more appreciation"]}
