It bothers you that she calls someone else, but *not because you want her to call you*, seemingly you prefer she simply suffer silently so you don't have to be a better partner. I can imagine you make even activities she loves a miserable thing to do. Here's hoping she gathers her strength and gets the hell out.", "Sounds like emotional torture to be doing these activities with you so I don\u2019t blame her", "You don't really like her much, do you?", "Misread this as \u201cthrown up in my hands instead\u201d \n\nGave me a chuckle", "Absolute relationship goals!! We're almost to that point at 17 years of marriage, 20 years of being together.", "Fucking lmao \ud83e\udd23 \ud83d\ude02 \ud83d\ude06", "Yeah but she needed someone \n\nCan't she have friends ?", "You must have some of your taste buds back, because you are salty as fuck.", "you still can't smell or taste? how awful for you...makes a life threatening infection and its long term physical and psychological implications pale in comparison", "You know what's not fair? That you cannot have a mature (not accusatory!) conversation with her, that you don't try to continue working on your relationship, you just sneekily try to destroy a connection which you wife obviously enjoys.\n\nWhy? Because she might realise that there are better men out there than you? Your are kinda proving that.", "Did you make any effort to 'be' there for her...call, text, facetime?", "What's not fair?", "Even if you could have visited her, I\u2019m sure that you would just complain that you had to spend time with her while she was \u201ccomplaining\u201d. She\u2019s better off without you there.", "It's your fault she was in the hospital with a life threatening illness in the first place. If you had taken even a moment to prepare the most basic of supplies for camping then she wouldn't have gotten sepsis.", "\"It's not fair.\" Are you 6 years old? No, life isn't fair. You know what also isn't fair? You not showing her support even after you recovered and she was home. You're trying to sabotage the (apparently) only social support she has.", "Phones do work in hospitals\u2026", "Maybe Seth can come and comment because I'm sick of OP and scared for his wife \ud83e\udd23", "Why not both? Both is good.", "I swear, the more I read of OP's comments the wider my eyes are getting. Wtf.", "I can\u2019t \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02", "How is it that her new friend would be a better partner than her actual partner? \nDid you bamboozle her into settling for you?", "She has her own friends", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "New flash, she has made a new one.", "Yes. His name is Seth.\n\nEdit: in another comment you said that she should keep these things private so which is it: she can vent to friends or she cant?", "Huh I see why your marriage is failing", "So your friends can't also be her friends?", "Maybe consider divorce, she could already be having an affair with Seth, physically or emotionally\u2026I don\u2019t know your relationship dynamics but surly she should call her friends instead of your own right?", "Or a new potential affair partner.", "Ohhhhh, he just doesn\u2019t want HIS friend knowing how much he sucks.", "Anyone is a potential affair partner. Shall we now prohibit people having friends of the opposite sex? Or any friends at all? To spare the feelings of shitty, jealous, insincere spouses who cannot be bothered to even think about the reasons why their partners prefer someone else's company over theirs?\n\nSplendid way to try saving a marriage, indeed.", "That\u2019s the vibe it\u2019s giving me."]}
