No one should be pressuring you into marking your body forever. This sounds like one of those glass children situations where a special needs kid becomes the center of everything in a family, so the needs, wants and boundaries of the other children are completely overlooked.", "NTA. It is nice that they want to show their support for him in this way, but it's not the only way. Especially since you, too, are on the spectrum. \n\nPlus, puzzle piece is highly controversial among autistic people. Many don't see it as a good symbol. It is often used by parents and family, more than autistic people themselves. If you are on the spectrum, too, your feelings about autism matter more than that of your family. There are many different ways to show your love and support to your step brother.", "NTA - your skin your rules, but also the puzzle piece movement has really awful roots. I\u2019d recommend researching them. Their symbol was created without any input from autistic individuals, the puzzle piece came from it being a \u2018puzzling condition\u2019. The original puzzle piece even had a crying person inside to show the burden autism put on their family by being autistic. \n\nAutism speaks uses a puzzle piece as it\u2019s logo and they\u2019re known for being awful to autistic individuals. They researched a cure for a very long time, and most horrifyingly - encouraged research to be able to screen for autism in utero so the pregnancy could be terminated if autism was detected. \n\nMost autistic individuals do not support the puzzle piece logo, and instead prefer a butterfly as it symbolizes growth and hope for the future.", "NTA It's your body. They have no right to guilt you into permanently altering it. Plus when you take into account the controversy surrounding the puzzle piece symbolism for the autistic community, it adds an extra layer of potential issues. Especially since you yourself are autistic. (I don't know how you feel about it specifically.)", "Tattoos are permanent. If you don't want it on your body, then end of discussion. It's not up to anyone else.\n\nNTA", "NTA.   Tattoos are a big freaking deal!  It's YOUR skin!  They don't just wash off.  No is a complete sentence regardless of the other person's feelings.", "NTA. first of all because it\u2019s your body, second of all because autism speaks created the puzzle piece and the creator of autism speaks literally openly talks about how she nearly drove off a bridge with her daughter in the car because suicide + child homicide is easier than taking care of an autistic kid. \n\nkudos for not getting it. i\u2019m autistic and the puzzle piece is a fucking disgusting token that we\u2019ve never actually accepted. it implies we are challenging/challenged (which may be true at times but is incredibly ableist to point out and generalize. especially when there are some autists like me who are persistently independence driven who actively refuse outside guidance or support) , and that we don\u2019t fit into the bigger puzzle. it doesn\u2019t seem that way for most- it seems harmless- but it\u2019s also infantilizing for autistic adults. kids that are autistic grow up, we don\u2019t remain children and assigning a toy as symbolism for our disorder is Bad.", "NTA, it is your body.  No one has the right to make you put something on it you don't want there.  \n\nTell her no and feel confident in doing it that it isn't something you are willing to do.", "NTA. That's a big deal and it's your body. This isn't something random and arbitrary/petty like asking you to have a picture of him in your room. You should never get a tattoo you don't want. Not wanting it shouldn't be viewed by her as commentary on how you feel about him either. I love my wife and kids and I don't have tattoos related to them on my body.", "NTA - they don't get to brand your body. One no should have been enough.", "NTA I struggle to understand why permanently marking your body with something you don\u2019t want, no matter the familial importance, is even a question. It\u2019s your body, your choice.", "NTA\n\nIt's your body.  You don't need a tattoo to prove you love your brother.", "Having a tattoo is quite a commitment, and a really great sort of \u201ctribalism\u201d for declaring yourself a member of a self-made group of friends/relatives. I know a group like this who all got similar tattoos as a sort of modern family crest. Everyone\u2019s was slightly different, but it was all the same looking piece, and it was usually pretty big. \n\nThat being said\u2026.\n\nTattoos are a great way to belong, but they\u2019re not the only way, and wanting to show your commitment and affection in a different way shouldn\u2019t be viewed as a failing on your part. \n\nSay those exact words, or rearrange them slightly to tell your stepmother that you take both tattoos and family seriously, but you should not be pressured to get a tattoo to prove anything to them. That pressure, in fact, will cause the opposite effect, eventually, and if you get a tattoo in hopes that it will relieve you of the pressure, you\u2019re just going to resent both the tattoo and the family.\n\n\nNTA", "NTA.

That tattoo clearly means something personal and is special.\n\nBeing pressured into getting something with so much meaning isn't right.", "NTA. It's as simple as this, your body your choice. That should be the end of the discussion.", "NTA. if she wants ask her to get it again in any other place in her body", "NTA: Getting a puzzle piece tattoo for an autistic person is a big YIKES.
