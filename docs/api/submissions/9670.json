As you've likely seen.. yes, the Autistic community doesn't at all like the puzzle piece symbol; It's linked to Autism Speaks, a disgusting group. They believe Autism is \"curable\", which.. No?

Secondly, to not even do basic research and learn that the puzzle piece is a really harmful symbol that pretty much everyone in the community hates, is wild to me. Autism Speaks is a horrific organization that essentially just looks to \"fix\" Autistic people. \n\nYour family saying you're not Autistic because your diagnosis wasn't official is absolutely abhorrent to me. Most of the community is pro-self diagnosis because getting \"official\" diagnoses is so time-consuming, complex, expensive, and honestly just *purely* based on privilege. It has historically been, and still is, much, MUCH harder for female, BIPOC, queer, trans, low-income, and Disabled people to be diagnosed with Autism, simply because *the standard was not written for us.* Autism was studied in young, middle-to-upper class white boys--and we are judged by the diagnostic standards written from them. At every turn, we are cut out of the conversation, and medical \"professionals\" often will dismiss people upon *sight* if they are looking for a diagnosis and are not male, young, and white. I had a psychiatrist tell me I wasn't Autistic because I made eye contact with him. When I told my current therapist that (we are both Autistic--I love it!), she was *pissed.* Because, she says, Autistic people learn to mask to *survive.* And then when we turn around and finally express how much *effort* it takes for us to act normal, because we're *masking,* we're told we're not actually Autistic because we even have the ability to mask in the first place. \n\nThis stuff also goes back to childhood and, of course, basic misogyny. When a boy expresses \"Autistic traits,\" he's more likely to be taken seriously and diagnosed. Girls, on the other hand, are more likely to be told there is just something wrong with us, and that we need to adjust ourselves to fit in. Girls learn to mask more--and we get diagnosed less. \n\nSome things I would recommend--look up \"Devon Price\" and their book titled \"Unmasking Autism.\" You can read some of their articles on Medium--they are Autistic and I personally love their work. Also, you should take the RAADS-R test (Autism screener) and CAT-Q test (looks at how much you mask--essentially, potentially compensates for lower scores on other tests for Autistic people)\n\nFinally, just a note (also a tw// antisemitism and Nazis) Asperger's is a term that is now out of use--I'm not sure if you're aware, but it was named after a Nazi, who also decided whether Autistic boys lived or died based on their perceived level of usefulness. This is where the terms \"high-functioning\" and \"low-functioning\" come from--and why they are so harmful. \n\nBest of luck with your family. I am very sorry--things will get better! Love from a fellow Autistic teenager <3", "The puzzle piece symbol is far older and from a U.K. organization:\n\n\"The puzzle piece is so effective because it tells us something about autism: our children are handicapped by a puzzling condition; this isolates them from normal human contact and therefore they do not \u2018fit in\u2019. The suggestion of a weeping child is a reminder that autistic people do indeed suffer from their handicap.\n\nFrom a presentation by Helen Green Allison given in 1987\n\nThey actually changed their name from The Society for Autistic Children to The National Autistic Society in 1982, recognising that autism is a disorder that affects adults as well, something that several well-known organisations still struggle with today. But the puzzle piece with the weeping child remained in place until as late as 2002, around the same time they started making an effort to include autistic people on their board.\"\n\nhttps://autisticook.wordpress.com/2013/11/30/autistic-history-month-the-puzzle-piece/", "You are absolutely correct!

For example, being a precocious adult also means you are neurodivergent, and the assessment for it would be different than the assessment for autism.", "No, the diagnosis is for *you*. It doesn't make one whit of difference in their day if *you* get diagnosed and then can build and pursue a treatment plan. They're not going to suddenly have whatever it is you've been diagnosed with.\n\nGoing to let you think about that one for a bit. I know that the concept of actually seeking treatment and recovery as opposed to wallowing in dysfunction and using it to gain social standing on social media is alien but trust me it's a better way to live.", "I didn't sit in, I was in the waiting room with no wifi. It was a waste of time and money just to feel invalidated.", "Oh no, I'm getting anxious about the 700 dollar ADHD test I have coming up that's 2 hours long and not just a 2 minute conversation with me watching me not stop bouncing in my chair.\n\nAre they just gonna do research on me?", "> but also more likely to mask their behaviours to fit in (and being apt at doing so).\n\nAlternatively they're astronomically less likely to be pathologized just for existing inconveniently and are given staggering preferential treatment throughout the entire education system from kindergarten to postgraduate.... which lines up perfectly with everything from discipline and drugging rates to dropout and suicide rates.", "I believe the assessment was garbage. It was performed by a student with a professor, but asking ridiculous questions for actual hours, like I was there, I was sitting waiting in the office for moral support for what was supposed to be an hour and a half long session- turned into nearly three hours, the next session I was waiting for her to meet me afterwards and it was supposed to be two hours, turned into three and only stopped because I was worried about my friend not meeting me at the designated time. My friend was exhausted by these tests and didn't perform as well as if the tests were shorter, but I feel like this wasn't given any notice whatsoever.\n\nThey said she, a person diagnosed as having Aspergers as a child, didn't have any form of Autism, nor did she have any ADD (which, I know... that's also not true. She has the hyperfocused ADD and she gets the wigs when something isn't 'finished', and she can stay focused on incredibly detailed projects for weeks), by asking her questions about Cleopatra and maths questions. A person I have known for 16 years and I know she is Autistic, because she makes sense to me in a world where almost nobody makes sense to me.\n\nConsidering it was a student doing the test, I am of the opinion that they used a new or unconfirmed test, doing some form of experiment with my friend, which she wasn't aware of. She thought she was getting a diagnosis and trusted these people."]}
