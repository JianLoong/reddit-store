As you've likely seen.. yes, the Autistic community doesn't at all like the puzzle piece symbol; It's linked to Autism Speaks, a disgusting group. They believe Autism is \"curable\", which.. No?

Secondly, to not even do basic research and learn that the puzzle piece is a really harmful symbol that pretty much everyone in the community hates, is wild to me. Autism Speaks is a horrific organization that essentially just looks to \"fix\" Autistic people. \n\nYour family saying you're not Autistic because your diagnosis wasn't official is absolutely abhorrent to me. Most of the community is pro-self diagnosis because getting \"official\" diagnoses is so time-consuming, complex, expensive, and honestly just *purely* based on privilege. It has historically been, and still is, much, MUCH harder for female, BIPOC, queer, trans, low-income, and Disabled people to be diagnosed with Autism, simply because *the standard was not written for us.* Autism was studied in young, middle-to-upper class white boys--and we are judged by the diagnostic standards written from them. At every turn, we are cut out of the conversation, and medical \"professionals\" often will dismiss people upon *sight* if they are looking for a diagnosis and are not male, young, and white. I had a psychiatrist tell me I wasn't Autistic because I made eye contact with him. When I told my current therapist that (we are both Autistic--I love it!), she was *pissed.* Because, she says, Autistic people learn to mask to *survive.* And then when we turn around and finally express how much *effort* it takes for us to act normal, because we're *masking,* we're told we're not actually Autistic because we even have the ability to mask in the first place. \n\nThis stuff also goes back to childhood and, of course, basic misogyny. When a boy expresses \"Autistic traits,\" he's more likely to be taken seriously and diagnosed. Girls, on the other hand, are more likely to be told there is just something wrong with us, and that we need to adjust ourselves to fit in. Girls learn to mask more--and we get diagnosed less. \n\nSome things I would recommend--look up \"Devon Price\" and their book titled \"Unmasking Autism.\" You can read some of their articles on Medium--they are Autistic and I personally love their work. Also, you should take the RAADS-R test (Autism screener) and CAT-Q test (looks at how much you mask--essentially, potentially compensates for lower scores on other tests for Autistic people)\n\nFinally, just a note (also a tw// antisemitism and Nazis) Asperger's is a term that is now out of use--I'm not sure if you're aware, but it was named after a Nazi, who also decided whether Autistic boys lived or died based on their perceived level of usefulness. This is where the terms \"high-functioning\" and \"low-functioning\" come from--and why they are so harmful. \n\nBest of luck with your family. I am very sorry--things will get better! Love from a fellow Autistic teenager <3", "The puzzle piece symbol is far older and from a U.K. organization:\n\n\"The puzzle piece is so effective because it tells us something about autism: our children are handicapped by a puzzling condition; this isolates them from normal human contact and therefore they do not \u2018fit in\u2019. The suggestion of a weeping child is a reminder that autistic people do indeed suffer from their handicap.\n\nFrom a presentation by Helen Green Allison given in 1987\n\nThey actually changed their name from The Society for Autistic Children to The National Autistic Society in 1982, recognising that autism is a disorder that affects adults as well, something that several well-known organisations still struggle with today. But the puzzle piece with the weeping child remained in place until as late as 2002, around the same time they started making an effort to include autistic people on their board.\"\n\nhttps://autisticook.wordpress.com/2013/11/30/autistic-history-month-the-puzzle-piece/", "You are absolutely correct!

There's often some kind of self doubt though, especially with those who are able to pass as neurotypical with masking and a lot of compensatory coping mechanisms. Kind of an impostor syndrome? I.e. not autistic enough to feel truly autistic, but too autistic to be neurotypical. For those people getting an official diagnosis can help to reassure them that they aren't an impostor. But practically speaking, unless \"proof\" is needed for official accommodations, an official diagnosis doesn't really do much for the autistic person.

Thank you so much for your input! I really appreciate it!", "You are totally correct! Thank you for your input!", "You are 100% correct! I agree with you! Thank you so much for your input!", "That is such a smart idea! Thank you so much for your input!", "I have recently learned the meaning behind the puzzle piece (Thanks for the lovely people here) and I definitely do not want to be associated with a Nazi, especially one who was so terrible to the autism community! Thank you so much for your input!", "That is a way to look at it. Now it does sound super silly! Thank you for your input!", "Yeah I'd probably fight with anyone who tried to force me to put that awful puzzle piece on my body. It's a hateful symbol from a terrible group. They defend people who murder their autistic children because \"it's so hard to raise them\".\n\nSo yeah......", "Thank you so much! You are so kind! I really appreciate you!", "Wow! You are totally correct! Thank you for the kind wishes and I will be careful! Thank you again for your input!", "It is totally okay! Don\u2019t feel bad for voicing your opinion especially since you didn\u2019t know. I am trying to read everyone\u2019s comments but there are over 300 so I do understand as to why you didn\u2019t know! And everyone has been so enlightening so it\u2019s not a problem!", "I\u2019m really happy that my post helped uou understand the problematic history behind the puzzle piece! It has helped me understand, and I hope it helps many more to understand!", "It\u2019s okay! I mean it is an \u201cam i the asshole\u201d so I understand! No need to apologize! :)", "I am so sorry! I had no idea that you were being sarcastic. I do apologize! Sometimes it is hard for me to understand when people are being sarcastic or not especially through texts, so I am so sorry!", "Hey, you want credibility? Read the original documents. Which means getting the title right. Lol. Ha ha. I'm right, you're wrong and every downvote confirms that. Tee hee.", "I love the positivity! I know you can do it. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83e\udef6", "You're welcome.", "I have recently learned about the problematic history (thanks to all the lovely people here and I will not be getting it) Thank you so much for the input!", "Oh it\u2019s all good my dear foe. You are forgiven now carry on to the promise land. Thank you.", "You have eased my doubts so much in saying that! Thank you so much for the input!", "That is such a good way to look at it! I didn\u2019t realize how much could come from a diagnosis! Thank you so much for the input!", "Thank you so much for telling me that! I will definitely be checking that out! Thank you for the input!", "Thank you so much! \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb\ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "Thank you!", "Of course! I'm happy to help. Life is tough and it can be easy to doubt ourselves, but as corny as it is, the saying \"if at first you don't succeed, try and try again\" can be very true. It won't be easy, but you seem to be incredibly strong. \ud83e\udd70", "My pleasure! So you're aware, self diagnosis is valid within the autistic community and there's heaps of support out there for figuring out how to navigate life more easily. It's well worth getting involved with the community - I especially like the tiktok community. Chris GAD is my top recommendation for newbies, does very relatable and well thought out content on the lived experience, challenges and ways to accommodate needs. All the best!", "You are so very welcome\ud83e\udd17", "Thank you so much for saying that! I am trying to read through everyone\u2019s comments and just got a reply calling me selfish. But thanks to all the lovely people responding to me. I know that it is not selfish to not want it on my body! That is such and incredible saying too! You seem so strong too. Thank you so much for voicing your opinion :)", "Thank you so much I will check them out as well! I appreciate you greatly!", "Some people suck. I'm glad you're not listening to them! And thank you, I'm currently going through a lot so I appreciate you saying that I'm strong. \ud83e\udd70", "I really hope everything works out for you! You are a strong courageous person! Thank you again for everything :) \ud83e\udef6\ud83c\udffb", "\nIt turns out that they were being sarcastic. Sometimes I have problems understanding when people are sarcastic or not. I do apologize. I have apologized them as well. I feel so silly. \ud83d\ude05"]}
