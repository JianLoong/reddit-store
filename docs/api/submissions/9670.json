As you've likely seen.. yes, the Autistic community doesn't at all like the puzzle piece symbol; It's linked to Autism Speaks, a disgusting group. They believe Autism is \"curable\", which.. No?

Secondly, to not even do basic research and learn that the puzzle piece is a really harmful symbol that pretty much everyone in the community hates, is wild to me. Autism Speaks is a horrific organization that essentially just looks to \"fix\" Autistic people. \n\nYour family saying you're not Autistic because your diagnosis wasn't official is absolutely abhorrent to me. Most of the community is pro-self diagnosis because getting \"official\" diagnoses is so time-consuming, complex, expensive, and honestly just *purely* based on privilege. It has historically been, and still is, much, MUCH harder for female, BIPOC, queer, trans, low-income, and Disabled people to be diagnosed with Autism, simply because *the standard was not written for us.* Autism was studied in young, middle-to-upper class white boys--and we are judged by the diagnostic standards written from them. At every turn, we are cut out of the conversation, and medical \"professionals\" often will dismiss people upon *sight* if they are looking for a diagnosis and are not male, young, and white. I had a psychiatrist tell me I wasn't Autistic because I made eye contact with him. When I told my current therapist that (we are both Autistic--I love it!), she was *pissed.* Because, she says, Autistic people learn to mask to *survive.* And then when we turn around and finally express how much *effort* it takes for us to act normal, because we're *masking,* we're told we're not actually Autistic because we even have the ability to mask in the first place. \n\nThis stuff also goes back to childhood and, of course, basic misogyny. When a boy expresses \"Autistic traits,\" he's more likely to be taken seriously and diagnosed. Girls, on the other hand, are more likely to be told there is just something wrong with us, and that we need to adjust ourselves to fit in. Girls learn to mask more--and we get diagnosed less. \n\nSome things I would recommend--look up \"Devon Price\" and their book titled \"Unmasking Autism.\" You can read some of their articles on Medium--they are Autistic and I personally love their work. Also, you should take the RAADS-R test (Autism screener) and CAT-Q test (looks at how much you mask--essentially, potentially compensates for lower scores on other tests for Autistic people)\n\nFinally, just a note (also a tw// antisemitism and Nazis) Asperger's is a term that is now out of use--I'm not sure if you're aware, but it was named after a Nazi, who also decided whether Autistic boys lived or died based on their perceived level of usefulness. This is where the terms \"high-functioning\" and \"low-functioning\" come from--and why they are so harmful. \n\nBest of luck with your family. I am very sorry--things will get better! Love from a fellow Autistic teenager <3", "The puzzle piece symbol is far older and from a U.K. organization:\n\n\"The puzzle piece is so effective because it tells us something about autism: our children are handicapped by a puzzling condition; this isolates them from normal human contact and therefore they do not \u2018fit in\u2019. The suggestion of a weeping child is a reminder that autistic people do indeed suffer from their handicap.\n\nFrom a presentation by Helen Green Allison given in 1987\n\nThey actually changed their name from The Society for Autistic Children to The National Autistic Society in 1982, recognising that autism is a disorder that affects adults as well, something that several well-known organisations still struggle with today. But the puzzle piece with the weeping child remained in place until as late as 2002, around the same time they started making an effort to include autistic people on their board.\"\n\nhttps://autisticook.wordpress.com/2013/11/30/autistic-history-month-the-puzzle-piece/", "You are absolutely correct!

Feeling like an alien faking being a human, or not having the manual on how to human seems to be a fairly universal experience, at least when social functioning is enough to recognise those differences. Then when stumbling into or actively researching the lived experience of autistic people, they are suddenly like \"hey, that is totally me!\". \n\nGetting an official diagnosis is in many ways not needed for the person to know that they are autistic, because to the person it is usually obvious. There's often some kind of self doubt though, especially with those who are able to pass as neurotypical with masking and a lot of compensatory coping mechanisms. Kind of an impostor syndrome? I.e. not autistic enough to feel truly autistic, but too autistic to be neurotypical. For those people getting an official diagnosis can help to reassure them that they aren't an impostor. But practically speaking, unless \"proof\" is needed for official accommodations, an official diagnosis doesn't really do much for the autistic person. It doesn't open doors, there are no treatments, etc. The official diagnosis is to prove to others that the person is autistic.
