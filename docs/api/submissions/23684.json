Absolutely not. Keep your axe as a reminder that it\u2019s okay to cut people out when they treat you disrespectfully.

You even offered to let her have it and she couldn't be bothered to come get it.", "NTA. Block her and keep the ax. She will probably try to get back with you when she realizes why her now BF who was an ex, became the ex in the first place. Don't give in.", "NTA. You agreed to give your GF an old axe. You now have a partially restored axe and an ex-GF. Sounds like the promise doesn't hold anymore.", "I wouldn't worry - you're not going to hear from her again anyway", "NTA, if you have not yet gifted an item it remains yours to do with as you please.", "She already ghosted you. Where's the dilemma? Axe her from your life.", "NTA. Her boyfriend can buy her one.", "NTA. Block her and keep it. It's yours now.", "Def not. \nI\u2019d be keeping that shit for sure!", "It's an old superstition, that if you buy a knife for a friend or relative, you \"sever the bond.\" Must hold true for axes as well.", "NTA.\n\nNothing more to add to the discourse except I'm disappointed by the lack of axe/ex puns in the comments thus far. It's *right* there.", "Nope. Keep it.", "NTA. She broke up with you, ghosted you when she was going to pick it up so lost her opportunity.\n\nEnjoy restoring it", "NTA A gift ungifted is a gift not given.
