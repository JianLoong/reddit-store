She has manipulated you (and tried to manipulate your family).\n\nIt sounds like your family are kind of AHs for not following a dress code. Even quite poor people have 'Sunday best' or can get something within guidelines at a charity shop--unless your fiance is set on black tie/full-ball-gown, in which case the two of you should offer to cover at least rentals, and your family shouldn't refuse because this sounds like disrespect not principle.\n\nIf your fiance doesn't want to get married anymore, that resolves it. It sounds like you're at least not interested in the wedding itself.

She said she doesn't want the wedding was it just out of anger or does she mean it at the moment? If she means it i'd suggest delaying the ceremony if financially possible. Either way you both need therapy; she needs therapy for her need to control every detail and i think you may need therapy for your childhood if it was bed enough for you to cut family out of your life (you are not in the wrong for doing so)", "I think you may be using the word \"indifferences\"  in a way I am not used to. This may be the case for other readers, who are also trying to figure out why you wouldn't invite your family (the clothes not being the main reason, as you've clarified in some of the comments.)  Indeference implies apathy to me and that you and your family are neither close nor is their any desire to be closer on any side. To say you have your differences would lead me to think you've disagreements. But what you're describing in comments is more like estrangement.  There's some trauma history in the family which has resulted in your disconnecting from them intentionally. \n\nEach of those possible things you may be saying makes be think differently about your fiancees choices. If you're apathetic, I'd be annoyed at her, were I you. \n\nIf you've disagreements- I'd really wonder why she was butting in and what she hoped to accomplish.  If you're estranged though- I'd be questioning her motivations a lot more carefully- because if you're estranged from your family why on earth would she do that? Is she intentionally inviting chaos into her wedding? \n\nYour fiance didn't take into account your own wishes about your family's invitations?  That bodes...ill for your marriage. She doesn't get to complain if they show up wearing unapproved colors, or the wrong style of dress or anything like that. She apparently knows what your family is like after 10 years together. I'd say if she invited them *against* your approval, they're her guests now. \n\nEta: hit post on accident.", "NTA WTF?! She didn't care that you didn't want them at the wedding and still invited them. So your opinion and bounderie didn't matter. But as soon as they could ruin her nice pictures, they shouldn't come?! And now you should uninvite them or have the talk, when you have the conflict with your family. She invited them, she can do the shit.\n\nBut do you really want to marry someone who went over your head, gave a shit about your feelings and now cares more about optics and her pictures?
