I just wouldn't ride with them anymore, and tell them exactly why; you don't like them doing drugs, and you can't trust them.\n\nEdit to add: re-read and saw that this is your \\*partner\\*. Well, lying about being high would be a breaking up offense to me. Period.", "DUI is DUI. They're breaking the law.

Your partner is endangering everyone around you by driving under the influence of any substance, including you. It seems like your partner values driving high more than they do you and your relationship, so you need to ask yourself whether this is someone you want to be in a partnership with. I\u2019d also advise you to avoid being in any car they\u2019re driving since you can\u2019t trust whether they\u2019re sober behind the wheel.", "NTA \nThat\u2019s incredibly dangerous your parter could literally kill someone", "NTA. Even aside from any dangers or poor driving, your partner has completely disregarded your concerns and the lingering effects of your recent car crash. My condolences\u2014I hope you\u2019re able to get through this trip and move on. \n\nRegarding not giving them their dab pen, it\u2019s understandable from a safety standpoint, but bear in mind that two wrongs don\u2019t make a right.", "NTA - driving while high or impaired in any way is always a horrible idea. I am sure riding with your partner after a terrible accident is nightmare inducing without adding driving under the influence.", "NTA but you would be if you let this go. I would advise don\u2019t get in the car with them ever. They need to realize how serious this is. If they hurt someone while high they would ruin lives and possibly risk jail time. The risks are just way too high. \n\nAsk yourself this - could you live with yourself if they got into an accident while high and kill someone - knowing you knew they were high and could have potentially stopped them?  \n\nYou\u2019re not being a hardass and them dismissing that you are shows they don\u2019t respect you and how serious this is. I\u2019d be rethinking the relationship over something this serious", "NTA. Your partner is being irresponsible and disrespectful of your feelings and safety. Driving high is not safe, no matter how much they think they can handle it. It impairs your reaction time, coordination, judgment, and concentration. It also increases the risk of getting into a car accident. You have every right to be uncomfortable with your partner driving high, especially after you were in a near fatal car accident recently. You should not have to figure out if they are high or not by their bad driving choices. That is not fair to you or anyone else on the road. Your partner needs to respect your boundaries and stop driving high, or at least let you drive instead.", "No way you're the asshole, this person is putting their own life and yours at risk. \n\n\"they're not a bad driver\" until something happens, that's reckless. If it was me I'd stand my ground and be like \"you either drive sober or i'll catch a bus\", it's also a good opportunity for you to see if they care more about a high or you", "Ok your not the Ah you need to let the police know because this is illegal and people get killed .\n\nHere is a list of questions you should look into \n\n1.

Just a thought to consider.", "NTA. However Y W B T A, is you let your partner continue driving like that and didn't report it to the police.\n\nDriving under influence of drugs is just as bad, if not worse than alcohol, and no matter the legality of those drugs in your country/ state/ city, they shouldn't not be driving whislt impaired in any manner", "ESH, you for not driving while they got high, them for getting high and driving and blowing your concerns off.
