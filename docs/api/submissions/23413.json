Yesterday there was an incident where my dad told Liam to take his shower. Apparently Liam was on his Switch while pretending to shower. My dad told him to put it away and my son got mouthy. He took his Switch away and Liam threw something at my dad. So my dad said he was taking his Switch away. \n\nI came home late and my dad told me what happened. I said I'd talk to Liam tomorrow. I told Liam he was going to write an apology letter to my dad and clean his car to make up for throwing a marker at him.\n\nIt was then that we noticed his Switch was missing. I called my dad and he said he took it with him and he wasn't giving it back until tomorrow because that's what he told Liam. I said it's fine and to drop it off. Plus Liam wanted to apologize. My dad said no. He's not giving it back until tomorrow.\n\nI told my dad that he was pissing me off and making me look like a weak parent l. Just bring the fucking thing back.

That's all on you. You make yourself look weak. Your dad told you exactly what happened and how he enforced the punishment. You can't take care of your son without pacifying him with electronics? That *makes* you weak - not only look weak.\n\nThis is bad spineless parenting. \"Boys will be boys\" as an excuse was outdated even decades ago.\n\nIt'll get worse when he actually hits puberty if you continue like this. \n\nThrowing things is nothing to make light off. What comes next? \nAnd your son can't even be 24hrs without his games?", "YTA. you have a free baby sitter who has a proven track record with working with multiple children and you think it\u2019s ok that his own flesh and blood threw something at your father?! Absolutely not. 0 respect for your father and he\u2019s going to have 0 respect for you guys and his grandpa if he gets his switch Back. What if he threw a book or something bigger and harder? What if the marker hit your fathers eye? Take some PTO and spend it w your child as this is clearly a cry of attention. I nor any of my siblings were violent during puberty. \n\nAlso the fact you told HIM to bring it back instead of going over there to apologize and speak to him adult to adult just shows the amount of respect you have for you father. \n\nMaybe you should find a baby sitter you pay to deal w your child. \n\nThis just made me so sad to read. I would never allow my child to treat my parents this way.\n\nEdit: you\u2019re a weak parent by not disciplining your son and somehow making this your fathers fault.", "Your dad is parenting better than you, he\u2019s punishing Liam and going through with the punishment. Absolutely the right thing.\n\nYour dad didn\u2019t make you look like a weak parent, you are one for not backing up Dad. Your son THREW AN OBJECT AT ONE OF HIS GRANDPARENTS !!\n\nIf I was your Dad I wouldn\u2019t look after Liam again unless I got an apology from both of you. \n\nJust, just seen your further updates.\n\n1. your Dad is lucky to babysit Liam, what the fuck? You entitled AH. \n2. 10 year olds act up? If my 10 yr old threw something, at any one, they would lose a lot more than their switch.\n3. Your son feels safe acting out his emotions around his grandpa? HE THREW A FUCKING OBJECT AT HIM!\n\nYou\u2019re making excuses for your sons shitty behaviour. \n\nYTA", "Why on earth did you chose this hill to die on? Your dad is parenting for you so let him parent. He's doing a good job don't undermine him....YTA", "You are a weak parent. Your dad is doing all the parenting right now. Actions have consequences, ffs. YTA", "YTA. Big time. You can't have someone be responsible for your kids without giving them authority over them. You're undermining your father's authority and teaching your kid that he can behave badly without consequences. If I were your father, I would decline any further babysitting.", "Liam lied. He threw something. And so he lost a privilege. For what a couple of days???? I think a week would be generous. You look weak because you want to write this off as him going through puberty. Saying sorry is a cop out. You didn't give him any consequences. You are wrong. You apologize to your dad and stop wussing out. You are teaching Liam that he can act abominably and just say sorry. YTA.", "YTA\n\nEither you support your Dad, when you have left him in charge of your child, or you find someone else to watch your child.\n\nIf you dont support your Dad, then your child will take advantage of that and your Dad wont be able to discipline him at all in future. Your child wont respect your Dad and will play you off against your Dad.\n\nIt would be different if the consequences of the bad behavior was abusive, but it wasnt. Taking away the switch for a day was a perfectly acceptable disciplinary consequence.", "YTA \nAs a parent a 10 year old tossing things to someone it\u2019s quite severe on my book. Also answering back in a disrespectful way, to anybody.\nRemoving the switch for a day it\u2019s really the minimum. And you should also write a letter to your father and thank him for all the parenting he is doing for you.", "YTA\n\nYou are leaving your kid with your dad all day, and then undermining him when disciplining the bad behavior?\n\nI would tell you to start babysitting and parenting your own damn kid. Seriously entitled and clueless parenting.\n\n10 year olds need to learn about hygiene. Kinda important, dude.", "It\u2019s hard for me to understand why it is such a big deal that your dad kept the Switch with him overnight. It seems like you are the one who turned this into a power struggle with your father. Is it because you couldn\u2019t stand going one single night without a video game to keep your kid occupied? That\u2019s not great man.", "YTA.\n\nLiam can go without his switch for a single day as punishment for lying to your dad about him taking a shower and then throwing something at him.\n\nIf my parent was babysitting my child while I worked and my child threw something at him for making him come off his switch to shower, I'd be taking the switch off him myself anyway and likely for much longer than a day.\n\nIf you're not going to be there to parent your child yourself, you don't then get to make demands of your parent when he punishes him for misbehaving while he's looking after him. The fact you wanted your dad to return the switch that night, which presumably means you was also giving it back to Liam that night, is probably why he acts the way he does. \n\nTalking to him is hardly a punishment. What if the object had hit your dad and injured him? (e.g. caught him in the eye) or what if it damaged something expensive you cared about like a TV or PC? Would he have been getting just a talk and his switch back the same day then?", "A child showing anger at reasonable expectations being asked of him and not wanting to stop gaming needs to be nipped in the bud. \n\nGaming addiction is real. A female friend of mine was assaulted by her son because she pulled the plug on his internet. The kid played GTA constantly, was failing school, was acting out when he couldn\u2019t game. Etc. \n\nParent your kid. Place strict limits on gaming time. And back up your Dad. Otherwise you will pay the price. So will your son. \n\nYour Dad should pull the plug on any further child care. Both you and your son need to grow the fuck up. YTA", "YTA - How do you look like a weak parent by sticking to the punishment your father set? Your son is 10 and should not be throwing tantrums and throwing objects at people. That is way way out of line and I think taking the switch away for just a day (or two) is actually a pretty lax punishment.", ">I told my dad that he was pissing me off and making me look like a weak parent\n\nYou are a weak parent and YTA. Your father is watching your son because you and your wife work. Your son mouthed off and threw something at your father, he can manage live a whole day without a Switch. Your father doesn't have to drive over to your home and drop off your son's Switch so he can apologize.", "YTA\n\nIf you're going to leave your dad in charge, you have to give him permission to discipline your son. The punishment was reasonable and fit the crime.", "YTA. Your dads message to his grandson \u201cyou can\u2019t disobey me and expect mommy and daddy to get you out of it\u201d leave the switch with grandpa and he can return it when said punishment is done, along with a stern talking to.", "YTA. Listen to your dad. He put a reasonable punishment in place based on Liams behavior while he was in charge.  \n\nYou are the one trying to undermine and make your dad look weak, not the other way around. If your dad is going to continue to watch him, then he needs the authority to discipline.  It sounds like he has an abundance of good sense.\n\nGetting mouthy and then throwing a marker is not acceptable for a 10 year old.  Hopefully, after he apologizes, cleans the car, and gets his Switch back tomorrow,  he will have learned a lesson.", "Yta. You aren\u2019t even around and you are attempting to usurp the power of the person who is the primary care giver. You need to re-evaluate your relationship with your child and you need to show some appreciation to the people working to raise your kid", "YTA. You kid doesn't get emotional. He threw something are your dad. Even if it's still just a marker that's not ok. \n\nYou rely on your dad for child care, either backup his discipline or find a new baby sitter.", "YTA. I'll usually say you're the parent so what you say goes. However in this instance your dad is helping you out and set a very reasonable consequence. Losing the switch for one day is not some extreme punishment for disregarding instructions to put it away and then throwing something at grandpa. I'm sympathetic to kids and puberty and emotions and all that but it's not a get out of jail free card. Also by making him bring it back you would be making things harder on grandpa when he watches your son bc your son would get the message that he can behave however he wants without consequences bc dad will just cave. If anything makes you appear weak it would be having grandpa give the switch back. Also for grandpa to come back over for son to apologize? That's not how life works. If your son does something hurtful to someone,  say a friend, they're not just going to cater to his whims and be like ok let me jump to come accept your apology. People need time to get over their anger and an apology helps but doesn't automatically make things new again. That's a lesson worth learning.", "Your comments are a joke. Your dad should feel grateful to have his poorly disciplined grandchild throw a tantrum after not listening and then actually throw something at him? Even if you were paying him, he doesn't deserve this. Get your head out of your ass. I hope he stops babysitting for you. YTA and get your kid under control", "YTA. First off, do you ever even see your son or does you dad basically raise him? \nSecondly, you son lied to your dad and then threw an objective at him. \nIt sounds like you need the Switch you babysit your son and instead of backing up your dad you are throwing him under the bus. \nWhy did you have a kid?", "YTA. You work long hours and when you're home your son has unlimited screen time? Your son is lucky he has a grandparent who loves him because his parents obviously couldn't give a crap", "YTA, \nYour 10-year-old is not throwing shit at your father because he is hitting puberty. He is a little entitled asshole and you harbour this behaviour by leaning tpp much to please him. Your dad did the right thing. He won't die without a game for a day. You should punish him for such a behaviour. It is crazy that you are not embarrassed that your father's generosity was met by your son's bratty behaviour.", "Good lord I\u2019m reading some of your replies to people and you are not a good parent. The fact that your son think it\u2019s ok to talk back and throw something at your dad just because he told him to take a shower. He probably stinks from the hot weather and being on the switch for so long. You are also disrespectful to your dad. He helped you watch your unfilial son and now you\u2019re trying to go over him by making him comply to your request even though your son is in the wrong? It\u2019s like an employee (son) ratting out a store manager (your dad in this case) to a district manager (you). If anything your dad should be the highest position. \n\nAnd what others are saying, your son can survive a day without the switch. He needs to learn his lesson.", "YTA.", "YTA. Your son can go one night without the switch. It\u2019s not as if your dad was refusing to ever give it back.", "The ONLY reason I would call into question your father's disciplinary actions is that he raised you, and you turned out like this. You ARE a weak parent, he's not making you look like that. You excuse your soon's childish tantrums as being \"emotional\". Yeah, that emotion is \"tantrum\". If he's lying about basic hygiene and throwing things at people, he needs discipline, and it sounds like you aren't enacting that. Your child needs discipline, and if he knows daddy will get him out of it, he knows daddy is weak and he can do what he wants. That's the lesson your 10 year old will learn and retain and it'll only get worse.", "YTA this is not how you show solidarity in disciplining your child. And his switch is exactly what he was using to avoid the shower, so it is an appropriate thing to withhold. if you can't think of ways to keep your child occupied for ONE DAY, it speaks more about your parenting skills than your insistence that he immediately get it back.", "YTA I'm glad your father knows how to parent because you haven't got a clue, your son lied, attacked someone and you're trying to reward him. Disgusting.", "YTA. And your Dad isn\u2019t making you look like anything. YTA for letting your son be abusive towards a caregiver in his life.

He took his Switch away and Liam threw something at my dad. So my dad said he was taking his Switch away. \n\nI came home late and my dad told me what happened. I said I'd talk to Liam tomorrow. I told Liam he was going to write an apology letter to my dad and clean his car to make up for throwing a marker at him.\n\nIt was then that we noticed his Switch was missing. I called my dad and he said he took it with him and he wasn't giving it back until tomorrow because that's what he told Liam. I said it's fine and to drop it off. Plus Liam wanted to apologize. My dad said no. He's not giving it back until tomorrow.\n\nI told my dad that he was pissing me off and making me look like a weak parent l. Just bring the fucking thing back.

Do you even hear yourself? \n\nBe the freaking parent and give your child real consequences for throwing an object at his own grandfather!\n\nBy the way, if this is how your 10 year old is treating someone who loves him, just wait until you start getting calls from the school and other parents regarding your son\u2019s actions.", "What else do you plan as punishment?

Taking the switch away is an actual repercussion and one that might help him control his behavior knowing gramps doesn\u2019t mess around. And, since your dad is doing the watching, I think it\u2019s good he is establishing boundaries with your son. 13 is just the start of puberty madness haha. I think you need to switch your gears from child to teen parenting now.

One big key is that you can't \"unpunish\" them for doing something good. Seriously, that's how you get escalating worsening behavior.\n\nHe did something bad, he is being punished for it. He did something \"good\" that he was forced to do and his reward for that is maintaining a good relationship with his grandpa.

Which is it?", "somewhere else you said, it wasn\u2019t a tantrum, he got emotional.\n\ntantrums, are result of feeling an inability to control a situation  and emotional response to it", "No, it's not.

She's got me all the way fucked up. Your kids cannot act like that because as they get older it's going to get harder and harder to deal with them.\n\nAt 11 it shocks me that he's throwing fits like that and you think it's okay that he's throwing stuff! And I know parenting is a hard job, I do it 24 hours a day with three kids, but I believe that you're trying to take the easy way out.\nYou're also seriously demeaning your father when he is the only one that's actually there for your son on a regular basis.
