It was around 8pm in a rural town so the Walmart was relatively empty and me and my friends decided to divide and conquer. I was in charge of snacks and a few other small things. When in the Snack aisle, i overhear two people approaching in the aisle. One was a M75ish and the other was an employee who was M16ish. \n\nThe teenage employee was leading the older man into the aisle helping him find what he was looking for. The first thing I noticed about this dynamic was that the older man was being short/demanding and the employee was  very sheepish (which is understandable as it was probably their first job). The employee scouted the aisle and said \u201cSorry sir, we must be out of the bulk pack of coke zeros\u201d the old man got pissed and replied \u201cwell isn\u2019t that convenient, the one good item on sale is all gone. How are you going to make up for this inconvenience?\u201d The employee stuttered a little and said \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, we should be getting a shipment in tomorrow and there might be more in stock\u201d the older guy said \u201cWell you\u2019re going to have to make this right somehow, I see that Diet Coke bulk pack is also on sale *then he starts trying to barter with the employee like it\u2019s a pawnshop*\u201d After a good 2-3 minutes of the older guy barrating him, I spoke up and said \u201chere\u2019s 3 damn dollars, (the price difference between two smaller packs and the sale bulk pack) now stop harassing this guy.\u201d The older guy froze and told me to F off and that I was an entitled asshole. Luckily my comment stopped the interaction. The kicker is, when in my car, I saw the old guy get into a brand new Escalade  which made me question a lot about this guys intentions to start with.

If you did not, the young employee might not even recognize they should not be treated this way\u2026 maybe they weren\u2019t trained in the difficult customers or those who simply cannot be satisfied, and there are so many of those these days.  The older dude was offended because you called him out on his cruelty.  He was talking to a mirror: wasn\u2019t he acting like the entitled one?  Some people are just unhappy and it can overflow to others.  Thank you again for stopping his verbal abuse.", "NTA\n\nThat man sounds insufferable. Why harass a teenage employee over a few dollars?

I am curious though, did the old guy take your $3?", "NTA, old dude wasn't at a flea market. That kid does not have the ability to \"make it right.\" You buy what's there at the price that's listed or get something else. A friend of mine was at a store and went through this very scenario. She was at the checkout behind a guy doing the same thing. She finally got tired of it and said, \"sir, this is not a bartering system. Either pay the price or leave it behind.\" The only entitled asshole was the old dude.", "NTA though I think you should've been less aggressive about it. And I have to add, you took a huge chance, because it sounds like you were in the US and what you did was very dangerous. You could've ended up getting shot by the guy. Last July for ex, a fight broke out at a Walmart in Florida City and a man was shot dead. It's not safe to confront people in the US; it's a dangerous country.", "INFO: How do you expect confrontations with old guys driving Escalades and shopping at Walmart to end? Personally I\u2018d assume he was armed and stay clear.", "i'll take sh- that didn't happen for $400 Alex", "Old man sounds terrible, but one thing I have noticed about a lot of older people. They watch their money. We younger people might think it's only a few dollars, but an older person with ten million dollars wants the deal that was advertised. It can be annoying.", "Ugh. YTA. You make so many judgments about this man with zero evidence (did he buy that Escalade, or was it a gift from a child who wanted something dependable?)\n\nYou **were** behaving as an entitled asshole. Leave the man -- and the WMT worker -- alone. \n\nBe better.\n\nETA: welp, waiting on the karma hit.", "NTA.  Ever since I stopped working retail I really enjoy stopping other customers from being assholes.", "YTA\n\nThe only thing I hate more than shitty employees is customers going out of their way to stick their nose in to things that's literally not your business.\n\nAlso this reads like some child writing fiction.", "NTA.  After a weekend of watching some older people take advantage of some stuff, I think you did that poor kid a favour.  Just because you got old doesn't automatically mean the world owes you something......", "I think the reason why I stepped in (I never usually do) is because it hit home. I think a lot of people can relate to working in customer service jobs when they\u2019re younger and getting mistreated. I worked at a Subway for most of highschool and I still to this day have never felt so dehumanized.", "Nope. To clarify, I never pulled out the money I just said that while actively fumbling with my wallet and the interaction was basically over before I knew it.", "Actually Florida is the most dangerous state with their stand your ground law.   Several years ago a retired police man was acquitted of murder in the shooting death of a theater patron. The captain I believe, felt threatened when the victim allegedly (eye witness accounts vary) threw popcorn at him. \n\nMore recently two individuals got into a road rage incident that resulted in them firing at each other. They did miss each other but managed to wound each others daughter that was in the car with their father. One won\u2019t be charged based on stand your ground. I bet the other will get off based on the same law.", "If I was shot over offering someone money and to leave a kid alone, that says a lot more about him than me. From my experience, I don\u2019t know why I see many comments jumping into him shooting me. I\u2019ve grown up in very rural communities and also in the city and neither time did I assume some random person is going to pull out a gun over something like that.\n\nEdit: I worked at an actual gun chain in college as they paid well and even tho some people were weird, I also never felt endangered there either.", "Idk what to tell you, it did happen. It\u2019s not even that far fetched of a story I feel like stuff like this happens all the time", "I agree 10000%. My grandparents were both teachers and because of saving they were able to have children and a nice retirement. I kinda lose all\nEmpathy tho when he has a 100,000 SUV that depreciates thousands a year.", "That is very likely because of the economic situation they dealt with as kids/young adults. Also remember inflation is *huge* - I'm in my 30s and even still part of my brain recoils constantly when I see prices on things because it's so much more than it was when I was a kid. Multiply that by like 2.5 times, and I can absolutely understand why an elderly person would be very frugal. $1 to them is not the same thing as $1 to us, in their mind it's worth a lot, lot, lot more.", "I\u2019m genuinely curious what I did that was entitled? You aren\u2019t being very specific. Also, I didn\u2019t judge this man at all. He was being overtly verbally aggressive for the situation and wouldn\u2019t take no for an answer. I did however judge him a lot after the fact. I feel like your example of a child buying them a car is a far outlier and an escaldade isn\u2019t a \u201cdependable car\u201d it\u2019s a 100k luxury car with a giant engine that gets terrible gas mileage/depreciates poorly.", "I was going to take you seriously than I saw your reply history. Nice troll account", "found the old man's reddit account", "The only thing I hate more than people harrasing other people, is people with 0 civic sense, preferring to mind their own business, than helping people in need.\n\nThose people are cancer.", "Putting assholes in their place is everyone's business. Sucks if you are the asshole, but who cares about them.", "I could the same thing for you.", "[removed]", "Hey now, I was on your side, but you don't wish people get cancer.\n\nAnd the old man made it everybody's business by griping so loudly about it."]}
