I hands down know his daughter is priority over his parents, but I don\u2019t feel like I am as much as I should be. \n\nExample - his parents watch our child sometimes, and we often end up arguing with them over the fact they\u2019ve ignored our wishes and requests when it comes to what to feed her etc. Another example the first time they watched her overnight and for more than a few hours they drove her half an hour down the motorway to their family without telling me. I found out accidentally 4 days later. But also they\u2019re very intrusive when it comes to our home and cross boundaries.

It\u2019s only making his life harder because without his parents we would have to pay more for childcare, and he wouldn\u2019t be able to have as much freedom. That is what he means by that. \n\nThe outcome is that his parents get away with crossing boundaries and doing whatever the fuck they want with my daughter and in my home. I\u2019m not ok with that!\n\nEvery time he\u2019s gone through a period of fighting my corner and acting like a team, they\u2019ve actually listened and respected it. So it works!

You seems tired of losing so why chose to battle that you seem to lose repeatedly and the repeat again.", "NTA. You are not overreacting.  They drove your child to a location without letting you know.  And they are reorganizing your house.  You need to be firm with your request that they leave your home alone.  They are disrespecting your boundaries.", "NTA, that's *exactly* the way it should be. Maybe it's time to reconsider this relationship, because if he won't back you up, snaps at you for wanting to enforce the rules both of you had made, and has made it clear that he has no interest in committing to you, you are looking at this being the very best years of your relationship.", "I was also thinking something similar. It seems that some of this is an overreaction unless there are specific reasons for it. Unless the child isn't in a proper seat then why does it matter that they drove 30 minutes to see family while they have this kid?", "No allergies that I know of, but I\u2019m allergic to peanuts so I do worry she we be allergic too. We haven\u2019t tried her with nuts yet. What I worry about with food is then not cutting up up safely to prevent it from being a choking hazard, such as grapes. But also, we want to feed our daughter healthy food. The odd treat is fine but if they\u2019re watching her on a regular basis (the goal) then we don\u2019t want her eating biscuits and chocolate 3x a week and it being a regular thing. It\u2019s just how we have BOTH agreed we want to raise her. \n\nThey have a car seat yes but I do have concerns that they don\u2019t tighten her straps enough. I have raised this to my partner and on another occasion his dad got all funny with my and offended. I\u2019d literally seen the straps so loose though when he took us to the airport. My partner says I\u2019m overreacting to the car seat thing and that they\u2019ve driven their nieces kids around before. He doesn\u2019t get that that doesn\u2019t mean they did it safely, they just got lucky!", "Like your points here!\n\nWe all need to be a little flexible in family relationships but being a first-time parent is harrowing enough experience without in-laws disregarding your preferences.\n\nMy parents are around 15 years older than my wife's parents, so we never left our kids with my Dad alone EVER, not once.  My Dad was a loving, kind man and loved all his grandchildren immensely, but he was just too old school for us to feel comfortable with him watching our kid(s).  **I only bring this up because** most grandparents will try to bend your rules a little. AND the thing is, to them, they are often not doing anything they consider to be bending any rules.  If they are not willing to stick to **the rules you find most important**, then you have the choice to not have them watch your kids.\n\nAlso, the in-laws MAY be a smaller problem.  Wait until you have a teenager on your hands, then you will know the value of a partner that is on the same page.\n\nIf at all possible, the OP should try to put aside all their hurt feelings and ultimatums before embarking on a campaign to improve healthy communications.  **Easy to type, almost impossible to do.**  However, as human beings, we can choose to try to do this communication thing better.  It's never going to go exactly right but with love, patience, and the effort of a parent who would never give up trying to make life better for their kid(s) you can chip away at this because it matters that much.  Start with your partner, they are the parent of your child, so you need to improve this the most.  Just remind yourself that your listener is not always going to be at fault for not understanding what you want or mean.  So, I suggest you keep at it and try again with kindness and patience.\n\nWith understanding and encouragement, I say... OP, you decided to bring a little life into this crazy world and now you will forever be responsible for making the world, as good a place for your child to live in as humanly possible.", "Thanks for your honesty. I\u2019ve heard this before tbh but that\u2019s usually after me explaining EVERYTHING. Hearing it after just sharing this tiny piece of info means more than you realise", ">Things other than your daughter, I would advise you to choose your battles wisely.\n\nDid you miss the \"I know hands down that his daughter is a priority over his parents\"?", "OP is NTA for wanting her home respected but I feel this is more a control thing on her side.\n\nMy wife was similar with my parents when we had our first but by the time we had our second she had realised that kids won't die for not eating organic vegetables.", "It was the fact that they had already gone against a lot of requests in the past. She was 11 months at this point and I was anxious about leaving her overnight for the first time as it is. We had a wedding though that sa requested no children, and my partner was best man. They had never driven her anywhere before. Then 4 days later I find out. They hadn\u2019t even told me, I hadn\u2019t checked the car seat or anything. And when I\u2019d got back the day after wedding, I asked them if they\u2019d had a nice time together and what they got up to. His parents said \u201cnothing much\u201d and never mentioned it.

Unless they are complete morons , your daughter will be fine.", "Wow. You are very welcome. I've been there and it hurts, but please value yourself. You deserve so much better than this.", "Did you miss that I was saying when it comes to things OTHER THAN YOUR DAUGHTER choose wisely what you want to fight about?", "Boundaries are obviously important, but in the end, does any of this actually matter? They are grandparents babysitting doing grandparent things. Unless they are explicitly putting your child in danger by feeding her things she can't eat or not actually strapping her in the seat I think you need to ease up. \n\nYou cannot control every action all the time and will send yourself into a state by trying to. Even worse, you'll end up a helicopter parent with your daughter posting about you on here in years to come.", "You said \"you need to put your foot down when it comes to boundaries with your daughter\" insinuating that he is not prioritizing the daughter", "Really sorry that's how you misinterpreted what I said.", "Ok fair enough. What is the correct interpretation of what you said? If he already prioritizes the daughter, why does she need to \"put her foot down\" in that regard?", "That taking a stand for the daughter is fine, but otherwise they need to choose wisely."]}
