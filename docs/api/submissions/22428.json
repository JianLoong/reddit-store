I'd cancel his family's part of the vacation and use the refund to enhance my own.", "NTA. What a bunch of entitled nonsense. Cancel the trip yesterday, omg.", "NTA Dollars to doughnuts, your friend never mentioned to his social media \"friends\" that he was tagging along on your family's vacation because you paid for them to join you. I don't understand why TikTok and other social media platforms turn people with a few likes or views into nitwits.", "NTA - I would disinvite him and go with my family on the trip without him and his TikTok gang.  Save money and your sanity.", "NTA.  Cancel their tickets, their new friends can pay for it.", "NTA. Your friend is right, you don't control where people decide to spend their holiday, but I would tell him you can control who you treat to take on a holiday with you and you will remember this the next time you take a holiday and feel like being generous and want the company of friends.", "NTA\n\nCancel it.  Doubtlessly you're expected to pay for this horde of folks you don't know.", "NTA. He has made his family the centre of the trip even though it was initially your trip and you did a nice thing by inviting and paying for his to accompany you. It\u2019s a bit tone-deaf on your friend\u2019s part.", "NTA - He takes a gift and grifts to inviting others. He wants what he wants and does not care about you or your opinion.\n\nThis is not the holiday you planned so change any detail that would create a chilled time.", "NTA cancel the tickets and accomm for your \u201cfriend\u201d. He has taken advantage and these are the consequences of his actions. Maybe he\u2019ll learn, maybe he won\u2019t but at least your holiday will be more relaxing without him and his TikTok nuttery. The friendship will likely be over once you do this but let\u2019s face it, what sort of friendship was it if he\u2019d do this to you?", "NTA. It\u2019s an AH move to be an invited guest and then invite others without the okay of the host. You don\u2019t do that to a meal, a home, and event, and surely not a holiday!", "NTA \n\nTell him you are no longer paying, his new friends can foot his bill.", "NTA.   \nIf you don't want to cancel the paid vacation for your \"friend\" in its entirety, you can still change the dates you go so you won't overlap with his tiktok friends. If he doesn't like it he can go ahead and be mad about it.", "NTA. Cancel his tickets and reservations, there is plenty of time. You could change the dates of yours if you like.

Maybe to another location, if possible. When you are an invited guest, it is **never** okay to invite others or suggest that they tag along at the same time on their own dime. You did a kind thing, inviting that family at your expense so that you could enjoy a holiday with them, not a bunch of people whom you do not know who will feel like it is okay to crash all of your activities because they were \"invited\".", "He met them on Tik Tok?

So we are canceling everything. Which you can't control where people holiday or if they do, so it's OK.\" Wink, wink.", "INFO: What does that even mean? These other five families will vacation at the same spot as you? And will \u201ccrash\u201d your dinners, hangouts, etc? I assume that they\u2019re not invited to your home, but I\u2019d like to understand more.", "NTA. I refuse to believe that this is actually something a grown ass adult would do. Tell him you've cancelled the damn vacation, then reschedule just for your own family.", "NTA. I would be inclined to cancel the whole thing. A bunch of internet randos know where you're vacationing and plan on joining you!", "NTA- can you reschedule the holiday?", "NTA.  Let his new friends take his family on vacation.  What presumption of him to invite others in a holiday he is a guest at himself.  Time to get new friends."]}
