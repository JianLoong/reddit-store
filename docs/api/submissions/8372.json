It was a fairly small event but it was everything me and my husband dreamed of and there wasn\u2019t a single moment I\u2019d have done differently, until yesterday. For context, I have a 5 year old daughter from a previous (very short) relationship and her mother is no longer in the picture. My now-husband is the only other parental figure she\u2019s ever known and their relationship with each other is similar if not the same as mine is with her. We\u2019ve had a few conversations about how it was becoming time to officially make them father and daughter too, and I figured what better time to do that than our wedding day? After us and our wedding party had made their speeches, I gave my daughter an envelope of adoption papers (she of course knew what was in it) and had her give them to my husband as a \u2018wedding present\u2019. He was over the moon when he opened them and everyone else, apart from my mother-in-law, congratulated us on making our little family official.\n\nNow, for more context, my mother-in-law has never been my biggest fan for as long as she\u2019s known me (since my teens) and after many failed efforts to get along with her better I\u2019ve simply chalked it up to us just being different kinds of people and haven\u2019t let our not so great relationship get in the way of her involvement with my family and become a big deal. Yesterday when she was round for tea she pulled me to the side and asked if the adoption papers were real and I said yes, of course. She was silent for a moment and then said \u201cDid you really have to do it like that?\u201d, and when I asked for clarification she monologued for about 3 minutes about how I overshadowed her son\u2019s big day by making it all about my daughter, and how something like that should have been a private affair. This was my first time questioning if it was a good idea since a) my husband couldn\u2019t have been happier and would have 100% told me afterwards if he felt blindsided but since I know him I knew it wouldn\u2019t be an issue and b) the day was already about the union of me and my husband, and in turn the union of our family. However having slept on it, I\u2019m wondering if I went about it wrong and should have done it another time. So, am I the asshole or was what I did okay?", "created_utc": 1674769601, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10m3hva/aita_for_ruining_my_own_wedding_with_adoption/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Evil mother in law is grouchy and not for first time by the sound of it. Tell her to suck a lemon and shut up :) congrats btw", "> how I overshadowed her son\u2019s big day \n\n*snort*\n\nYou didn't overshadow it, you made it that bit more brilliant.\n\nYour husband was, in your own words, over the moon.\n\nThat was perfect.\n\nNTA and MIL needs to focus on her son's happiness.", "NTA. Your mother-in-law's feelings about this are irrelevant. What matters is that both you and your husband are happy about this. Congratulations!", "NTA. It's not her wedding. You liked it, your spouse liked it, she's just putting her nose whwre it doesn't belong.\n\nAnd I also love your sentiment. A marriage is a union of two families becoming one, and I think it was a great time for the adoption to be presented as official.", "NTA.  You did what would make your husband and daughter happy.  Obviously, you MIL isn't so concerned about that--since she isn't nice to you and you make your husband happy!", "What happens at your wedding is for you and your spouse to decide. NTA", "NTA, it sounds like it was a beautiful moment for you, your husband, and your daughter! What a wonderful gift, and it sounds like you all are so happy as a family! The MIL is the asshole, and it's sad that she can't be happy for the 3 of you!", "NTA. You and him had already discussed him adopting your daughter, so it's not like you blindsided him or something. That's a very touching wedding gift, and he was clearly thrilled to receive it. Don't listen to your meddling MIL - a wedding is about your union, not you as individuals.", "Nta, you're husband and daughter were happy. Your wedding about about your family and future together,  not your mil. Sorry you have to deal with that.", "NTA - your husband was happy with it. If his happiness that day was the most important thing, then sounds like it still worked out\n\nAlso if he hasn\u2019t been happy with it that would have been a red flag\n\nWouldn\u2019t worry about the MIL, some just can\u2019t be pleased", "NTA\n\nLike you said, your husband would have said something. And you are correct, marriage is about the unity of two people and two families, what better way to start off married life than to make it legally official your daughter has two fathers and not a step dad. \n\nSounds like MIL just wants something to complain about \ud83d\ude44 \n\nYou're a trooper for not letting her affect your relationship with your husband, and you both sound like wonderful parents. Congratulations on your marriage", "NTA sounds like the perfect wedding gift.\n\nYour mil has issues", "NTA! If your daughter was happy to be adopted, and your husband was happy to adopt her, then you created a beautiful moment to solidify your family unit - which is what the wedding is all about anyway. I can't think of a *more* appropriate place for this.", "NTA, but it sounds like she is more concerned with the \u201cetiquette\u201d of the situation than being unhappy with it, which makes her an annoying MIL and not a monster- or at least that\u2019s what I\u2019m hoping for you!", "NTA My husband knelt down after exchanging vows with me, and said vows to my son who he adopted shortly after.  It completely overshadowed the ceremony and was the most beautiful thing I've ever experienced.  20 years later, it still chokes me up.", "NTA. Your MIL is a narcissist that was mad that the spotlight and attention was not on her.", "NTA\n\nWhat a wonderful wedding gift.", "NTA. Not her wedding, she doesn\u2019t get a vote.", "NTA. Your husband was over the moon and it probably meant a lot in terms of commitment, not only from you but from your daughter also. What a lovely way to start a marriage! Your MIL can go and suck a lemon. She can take that bitterness all the way back down the aisle and home - where she will be all alone,", "NTA. Excuse me for being rude but i believe the people that it was meant to make happy MADE them happy. Your MiL can dig for dirt in sand.", "NTA. The only people this matters to are your daughter and husband, and both enjoy it. It makes the wedding even more special because it makes him more part of the family. Your MIL is annoyed her son is showing more commitment to your relationship than she's willing to tolerate.", "NTA  i think thats really sweet what you did!", "NAH. Extending MIL grace that maybe she was concerned her child was being pressured in to it, no assholes here. General rule is do not surprise folks with adoption papers publicly; that is a private convo. That said, doesn't seem like hubby was offended so who cares if you broke this \"rule\". I could presume MIL is just being an AH cause of your history, but she honestly could just be thinking what if it was forced upon her child? Absent any reason to doubt that, she's just lightly, privately questioned. A non-asshole move.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I would take her criticisms with a mountain of salt and a lot of sage.  It sounds like a beautiful moment for your family. Congratulations!", "NTA. That sounds lovely. I\u2019m happy for you and your family!", "NTA- mil just wants to comment on anything she could to try and ruin your memory of the day. Your husband was very happy. That\u2019s all that matters. \n\nMil can go suck a lemon.", "Just : are you happy about it? Is your hubby happy about it?\n\n Then what's the matter?", "NTA - sounds like MIL is jealous that she had no idea it was going to happen before it happened!\n\nNot that you needed to tell her, some mothers are just like that, they feel left out (even if it has nothing to do with them, they feel like it should be).", "NTA\n\nLOL I love how she said you \u201covershadowed her son\u2019s big day\u201d, like you were just some random guest at her son\u2019s wedding\u2026", "Definitely NTA the only opinions about your wedding that matter are between you and your husband. If he loved it then it\u2019s perfect; congratulations!\n\nEdit: than to then", "No NTA. She's out of line. Since you were sure daughter and husband were both on board even if it was a surprise timing for him you did nothing wrong. Now if he had been on the fence about it, yall had never talked about it that could be an issue. But as it was it was YALLS big day getting married and HIM becoming a father. That. H's not just about yalls kid but him as well and he was happy. Write her off or have your husband deal with her nastiness.", "NTA\nYou knew your husband wished for it. And you made his wedding day complete with this. Congratulations!", "NTA.   Apparently your MIL saw this Wedding as a huge Accomplishment for her son - does that makes you a trophy? - and you somehow stole his 'limelight' with the adoption gift? Uh, wtf.. ?  Your Wedding was a celebration of *your Love and Life together*; your 'gift' was very fitting, and as long as your husband was happy about it - that's all there is to it. Don't second guess yourself now. It sounds like MIL was a former bridezilla, and still sees things through *that* lens.", "NTA", "NTA, it's not her damn business, to me it sounds like she just wants to stir up drama, talk about it with your husband so she doesn't go behind your back, the three of you were happy and that's all what matters.", "NTA.  I think it's worth celebrating that your new husband is also a new, legal father to the child he loves.  I bet there weren't many dry eyes when this part of the ceremony happened.\n\nMIL sounds like she has some neurotic nonsense to cope with, but that's her problem.\n\nCongratulations to all 3 of you!", "NTA. You made his big day even bigger. MIL is no longer the main focus of her son\u2019s life and reeling from it. Don\u2019t give her the satisfaction of getting upset. Congratulations on your marriage and family!", "NTA. As long as your husband is happy with how it went, that's all that matters. You can't overshadow his day if he doesn't feel overshadowed.", "Ha, yeah, I felt myself preemptively wincing until that part got done and then breathed a massive sigh of relief.", "Great point of view, she is sort of protective of him in a way that even he finds overbearing at our age so i guess that\u2019s where she could be coming from. I would however like to say of course I\u2019d never present him with those papers without being certain he wanted to take that step, like I said this is something we\u2019ve discussed previously", "> maybe she was concerned her child was being pressured in to it\n\nBut she didn't raise that concern with her son first? Even extending that grace it seems an extremely tactless and rude way to address the concern.", "How would OP know what/if any convo took place between MIL and Hubs? Thats not a convo that needs to be shared. I certainly wouldn't tell my spouse that my mom dared question if I wanted to adopt my daughter/spouses child. I would tell mom I knew and make it be known this is to never be questioned again.\n\nSo either we presume a situation we don't know.\n\nI don't think its tactless, it was sheer tact. She didn't do it at ceremony, she didn't do it in front of son, she didn't do it in front of daughter. She waited for a private 1v1 convo. That is tactful.\n\nRude, I agree but, and this is my bias, you get to be rude to protect your kiddo.", "But if she asked husband, and husband is all good with it, why would she then confront OP? If husband told his mom that there's no problem, and she then insists to OP there's a problem?? She's being shitty. \n\nHer \"kiddo\" is a grown ass man and a parent to boot, she doesn't need to fight his battles for him, and she especially doesn't need to create battles for him and then fight them.", "I can't argue with you (cause I agree) but I can't make that leap based only on what OP said. Do I think you are right? Yes. Do I know you are right? No. So in that absence, I have to give her benefit of the doubt.", "Just realized you are right! She said OP ruined the wedding. That\u2019s like an ultimate asshole move removing the doubt!"]}
