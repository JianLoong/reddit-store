I will fall behind and productivity will suffer during these meetings due to having to continuously having to take my focus away to deal with him. \n\nHeck, if possible interrupt the meeting and state, \"I'm so sorry coworker X keeps messaging/calling despite the fact I told him I told him I was in this meeting. Give me a moment I need to mute him, he's literally messaging me every x minutes and it's extremely distracting. OH I'm so sorry, he's calling now. I need to send him to VM. He always does this and its all minor stuff. So sorry. Oh there he goes again.\" Basically, make him everyone's problem.\n\nIt's not MC but being petty AF so that way that'll hopefully light a fire under their ass. Especially if these meetings are with clients.", "I get it. I was pissed off just reading what the coworker was doing and I\u2019m not even OP, but that does not excuse the type of language OP used. I\u2019m glad your self employed and don\u2019t have to follow company rules. You\u2019re free to do what you want and that\u2019s honestly the dream.", "Yeah coworker would likely just get a reminder that others are busy, but it seems like they are contacting about actual work. \n\nOP would 100% get written up at most workplaces with actual HR depts for the response", "Yeah I'll allowed to cuss with coworkers not at them.  Big difference.", "This can backfire spectacularly if your management sucks.  Very short sighted or lazy supervisors will just conclude that you the complainer are the and just give you shit for speaking up instead of the actual problem coworker.", "He\u2019s been asked repeatedly to stop, so I disagree on your point about harassment.", "I'm with you. I'll purposely close out of email for an hour every now and then so I can get some work done without distraction. Email is the easiest thing ever to ignore until you're ready to deal with it.", "Ignore them? But then how can I whine on the internet?", "I don't understand where OPs own manager is in all this. If a co-worker did this to me multiple times I'd just show this insanity to my manager. OP claims in another post the co-worker once sent SEVENTY FIVE emails. There is no way management knows the extent of this but now OP has screwed it all up by one-upping the inappropriateness by cursing the guy out.", "Why can\u2019t the person stop harassing OP when he\u2019s busy?", "Yes, I have a coworker who leaves theirs on DND pretty much all day, none of us would get any work done if we respected it as don't even send an email. \n\nSounds like coworker goes a bit further than that but without knowing their roles, perhaps coworker needs the answers to complete work to their deadlines too", "This is what I don't understand, what is it that's so frustrating about the co worker sending multiple emails and phoning?  Turn off your notifications, put your phone on silent and job done.  It's not as if the coworker is standing behind OP poking him in the neck constantly.  \n\nIs coworker's behaviour annoying?  Yes.  Can OP do something about it?  Also yes.  But instead OP has gone nuclear and will be scanning the want ads this weekend.", ">Honestly, I never look at a coworker's status before sending an email.\n\nThat would be because DND doesn't make the requirement of working with coworkers disappear, which seems evade OP.", ">Honestly, I never look at a coworker's status before sending an email. \n\nNo one does. That's not how email works. What does this person thinks happens when it's someone outside of the company that receives the email? Are you calling to see if now is a good time to email? \n\nOP should be hitting the unemployment line.", "OP being written up is best case scenario honestly. Not only did OP cuss out a fellow employee, but they did it in writing. As much as I get their frustration (and I really do, I've had to work with my fair share of ass weasels), that type of behaviour is never appropriate in the work place. Full stop. \n\nThat's a really easy path to getting fired immediately depending on the job.", "It creates additional problems, and usually the consequences are worse for the person who lost control. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if OP\u2019s job was on the line over this.", "The problem with him is that he repeatedly bothers me when I'm clearly not available. \n\nI don't reply until I have the time, but he doesn't get that. I've told him multiple times \"If I'm on do not disturb, that means you're not getting a response from me until I'm ready to look at your email. You get to wait.\"\n\nHim spamming me is the problem. My phone constantly ringing while I have better things to do messes with my ability to work.", "Not at 15, and not at 20. I was unexpectedly out one day and he'd called my phone nearly 80 times.", "This is the question that needs an answer", "Where is your own manager in all this? They're aware this person is carpet bombing you with emails and voicemails all day and they're doing absolutely nothing to help you?", "Just screen his calls and put filters on his emails so they don't show up on the inbox. He can have a special folder to himself. You need to handle it better. I understand it can be tough - I have someone at work who is likely autistic cos there's so many behavioural issues that are incredibly annoying, and I've been trying my best to get on with him cos I know he doesn't do it intentionally necessarily, as he's not a bad guy, just an annoying one. You have to figure out a way to cope without being an AH yourself, and also without putting yourself in trouble professionally. ESH", "I can give you a nice tip - set his email into it's own folder, hidden somewhere in the outlook (I have a colleague who spams unimportant things often - there's folder \"Jared\" (not his name) hidden in 4 other folders/subfolders and it's hidden so I don't see how many mails I got. And I believe you can mute people in Teams so their notifications don't show up and at worst you'll have a number with messages there.  \n\n\nAnd yes if it's important he can visit me and I'll answer.", "And not only that\u2014it seems to me that being the target of an abusive email like this may actually make it *harder* to fire the annoying guy, because he can say he wasn\u2019t given a fair shot, his coworkers were hostile, etc. That\u2019s especially concerning if he has some kind of protected status; like, if he\u2019s disabled (eg, not getting social cues), an email like this might be read as showing bias on the part of OP. \n\nImagine this argument: \u201cmy client has a mild neurodevelopmental disability, and from this, his coworker assumed he was so stupid he couldn\u2019t read, and quickly became abusive in refusing to answer reasonable workplace questions.\u201d\n\nMight not convince a jury, but it\u2019s not something the company is going to want out in the world either.", "Turn off (or snooze) notifications", "Can you transfer the call to either his manager or your manager? I'd just transfer it every time he calls.", "Is it your personal phone or a work phone? Can you just block his number?", "We don't have a way to batch-delete voice mail with our system. I wish to god we did. I have to listen to each one of them and delete them.", "Idk. I\u2019m in HR and it would be a tossup between a final written warning and a term. They were very inappropriate and did it in writing so they have proof of it. If they just said leave me  alone without the rest, it would be a verbal coaching. But asking if they can read, saying eff off, it might be a term.", "Swearing at coworkers can backfire even more.", "Exactly.\n\nIf someone sent me 75 emails I'd tell HR that I was seriously worried about his mental health. That sort of harassment would not be ok in most workplaces", "OP\u2019s co-worker needs to learn emailing etiquette but OP needs to learn to ignore emails and not to blow up at colleagues. Only one person in this situation is potentially going to lose their job and that\u2019s OP", "Why turn it back on? Mine's been off for years. It annoyed me, so I changed my settings to what works better for me. \n\nI did not go off on a tirade on those that send me emails.", "It's also worth questioning why the OP and the coworker have different ideas about what's important. Maybe the coworker feels like they're unable to move ahead with tasks without answers from the OP, so they're anxious to get those responses so as not to get in trouble for being unproductive. They could have very good reasons for being stressed about getting those responses in a timely manner. Though pinging someone repeatedly in a short timer period is obviously not the right way to respond to that stress.", "He\u2019s in meetings, though. OP isn\u2019t trying to get out of working with his coworkers, he\u2019s trying to be productive and meet his responsibilities. In fact, it\u2019s probably hurting other coworkers when OP has to stop and decline a phone call. OP is being distracted, either by declining the call or the buzzing/ringtone. Clearly Joe isn\u2019t in these meetings, otherwise he wouldn\u2019t need to bombard OP during them.\n\nA before anyone says it, it doesn\u2019t matter if many meetings are pointless. They\u2019re still a dedicated time you\u2019re committed to focusing on and talking with coworkers in other departments, other offices, or people in different companies.", "Then maybe the job isn\u2019t for you if you can easily lose your shit over an email (or multiple emails)", "So block him or turn of notifications when you have DND on.", "Irrelevant. Grow up and stop being unprofessional", "That's harassment!", "Right? some days I don't even get 75 emails total. Nothing would be easier for me as a manager than telling an employee \"hey, sending 75 emails to your co-worker is insane, stop doing that immediately or you're fired\".", "We share the same manager. The manager has had talks with him ranging from the polite to just shy of actually yelling, but can't move forward with actually terminating him on their own.", "Oooh now here's an idea, divert the call to his own  number.  He'll get a permanent engaged tone.\n\nEdit: scratch that idea, Im not sure if you can divert individual numbers in Teams.", "Don't listen to his voicemail messages. Just fast forward and delete. If you have the option to fast foward.\nHR really needs to deal with  this properly. The guy seems unhinged", "If you terminated me because I repeatedly asked you to help me with a coworker harassing me and you refused to give me any reprieve resulting in my frustrated defense of myself I\u2019d sue you into oblivion.", "What about if you call, they decline and you call back? Because it\u2019s not just emails. And OP even mentioned the person was spoken to.", "His level of contact *is* relevant, though. He leaves a voice mail every time he calls. I have to listen to them to delete them - there's no way to just delete them unheard. \n\nHe's ignored management's direction to slow his roll, too.", "Indeed. And HR doesn't seem to give a damn, which is why I exploded at him. \n\nMy manager's on my side, but can only do so much.", "Ok, but setting aside the other person, what is your manager doing for YOU? Are you saying \"manager, I can't get any work done because my inbox and voicemail is filled with all this spam, what do I do?\" and the manager is just telling you to deal with it?", "That's what I do. I still have to *play* the messages, but I don't pay the slightest bit of attention to what he says.", "Oh for sure. The coworker's overall behavior is frustrating and inappropriate and the OP was right to complain to a supervisor. I was specifically talking about the emails, not the whole situation.", "Stop arguing with me. YTA. Accept that and accept you are about to fired for your unprofessionalism. Again grow the fuck up.", "Oh, I certainly won't get fired. HR doesn't do jack here. \n\nMy manager has already said \"Consider this me technically scolding you for swearing at him.\"", "How much trouble will you get into if you completely block him? I know this isn\u2019t an advice sub but I do have an idea. People often don\u2019t want to do anything unless they feel the pain (HR, the managers) so they have to experience the harassment before they\u2019ll make it stop. My suggestions: you completely block/ignore all his phone calls and make an outlook rule that anytime he emails you his email is deleted unread and an auto response is sent \u201cI\u2019m unavailable, route all requests through (Manager)\u201d. \n\nOr - set up a rule that all emails are immediately deleted, unread unless his manager or HR is cc\u2019d. \n\nOne of three things will happen - he\u2019ll message less because he doesn\u2019t want them to get so many emails or they\u2019ll be bombarded by his messages and feel the pain, or you won\u2019t get any messages because he doesn\u2019t cc them and his emails are deleted. \n\nBut you are going to have to accept that you cannot control him or is behavior. We know your goal is to make him be reasonable. But he sucks and you can\u2019t force him not to suck. It\u2019s not possible.", "Well, the problem arises when someone files a complaint with an outside agency about a hostile work environment. In my jurisdiction it would be the Commission of Human Rights and Opportunities and your emails will be exhibit one."]}
