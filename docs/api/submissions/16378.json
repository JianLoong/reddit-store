I'll get to it when I get to it.\n\nYou should have continued to inform your boss or HR. Now he has this email of you being unprofessional that he can go to HR with.

It\u2019s really not hard to ignore emails or messages that come through while busy. Calls are more of an issue, but it\u2019s still just a click and it goes away. How you react to a situation is 100% up to you. \n\nUnless this is an every minute of the day kind of thing, if you are getting so frustrated by these things that it\u2019s affecting your work then you may need to take some personal inventory and get better at managing stressful situations.", "You can add a rule to Outlook to add a 5 minute delay on outgoing email. \n\nRealize you forgot something?

Unless they are multiple emails about the same thing, I guess.\n\nBut if OP is annoyed by the alert that he has an email, that's OP's problem.\n\nInstant messaging is generally for direct contact and email for \"answer when you can\".

Respond to the initial email when you have the time. Trash the rest.\n\nHonestly, I never look at a coworker's status before sending an email. Unless it's flagged as urgent, it should be understood that an email doesn't need to be responded to immediately. If I need an immediate response to something, I'll ping them, which I obviously wouldn't do if they were set to Do Not Disturb.

So no he\u2019s not the AH. he did everything he could and cursing was the last resort he had to take. I\u2019m sorry but your point is invalid as he tried everything before cursing at him.

But if their on the same level professionalism is no longer important? \n\nThis guy was annoying and can be considered an AH. But so was OP response of cursing them out. They aren't a child, they're an adult.  That's the thing here if this was some 16 old kid ill get it. Not an adult with a professional job. \nBut hey let's agree to disagree. \ud83d\ude01\n\nETA:   love when people get butt hurt reply and than block lol", "No the difference is the manager can fire someone as opposed to two coworkers.
