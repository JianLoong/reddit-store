She said it looks very serious so I drove over to her house right away. I took them to the animal hospital. During the ride I asked her if something happened before he started throwing up. At first she said nothing but then she told me that she shared some chocolate with him.\n\nFortunately, the vet was able to save his life. Never been more appreciative of charcoal. After paying the bill and taking her home, I started snapping at her that she should have known better after owning a dog for three years and was a bad owner for doing what she did. She broke down into tears, saying I didn't have to remind her of how badly she messed up when she already knew and was feeling bad enough about herself already.\n\nWe still talk but I think I might have really damaged our relationship by reaming her when she was already in a fragile state like that.

She should have known better.", "NTA\n\nDogs not being able to eat chocolate is a VERY well known fact. It would be hard to not have a strong reaction to your sister\u2019s failing here.", "Hi OP,\n\nNTA. \n\nYou were right and didn't know whether or not she felt bad or had learned her lesson. \n\nChocolate being deadly for dogs is common knowledge so her behavior was incredibly reckless as an owner who should be educated in dog care needs. \n\nYou drove them to the vet and covered the bill.\n\nYour sister being more emotionally sensitive/expressive than you and taking longer to move on from the situation doesn't mean you are in the wrong and you shouldn't feel guilty.", "NTA, maybe not the right time but someone had to tell her. \n\nThere are things you NEVER feed a dog and as a dog owner of 3 years she should know better.", "Let's all be grateful that she didn't give him Tylenol for pain after the chocolate. \nNTA!", "NTA she screwed up. You had a reaction. Come on everybody knows chocolate and dogs don\u2019t mix. \nYou can apologize for upsetting her but you don\u2019t need to apologize for what you said to her.", "NTA\n\nWhat kind of idiot gives chocolate to a dog\u2026", "Oh, are her feelings hurt? Did you raise your voice to her at a fragile moment? Good grief. If I do something that dumb and almost kill a pet, yell at me all night. NTA", "I have never had a dog in my life and I still knew you don't give a dog chocolate bc it's poison to them by age 10 at the latest. What's your grown-ass adult sister's excuse? NTA. If she can't remember basic animal safety facts like 'Don't Poison Your Pet' she is not capable of owning any animal let alone a dog.", "Even my 7 yr old knows that chocolate is bad for the dogs.... Nta.... That's a special kind of stupid.", "NTA \n\nBefore I got my dogs, I looked up all the foods they shouldn\u2019t have, and if something new comes up, I look it up just in case.  I also looked up plants and medications that were harmful. Maybe you could have waited until the next day, but better hurt feelings than a hurt/dead dog.", "NTA.\n\nYou were not out of line. \n\nShe could have killed her dog.", "NTA. We all get the stupid. But part of that is accepting we get called stupid. Just watch your back because if you ever come down with it, she's gonna enjoy pointing it out.", "INFO: Did she know chocolate was toxic for dogs and fed the dog chocolate anyway, or did she really not know?", "NTA. \n\nCats > Dogs \n\nThat being said, your sister was foolish.", "The funny thing about chocolate is it depends on what kind it is. My pomeranian got in to and consumed an entire bag of kisses with the foil on and the vet didn't seem to give two shits. He said bakers chocolate is the stuff that'll kill dogs. \n\nI want to say chocolate being toxic to dogs is common sense, but here we are, apparently she didn't know any better.\n\nI think you flying off the handle like that did nothing to help the situation at all.\n\nESH", "Soft YTA. She just way her dog almost die, she already knew she was a bad owner and that it almost killed her dog. You yelling at her was totally unnecessary and unkind.", "NAH. People are mean and stupid by nature sometimes. You were mean; she was stupid. Don't apologize for what you said, exactly (it is true: she should have known better), but do apologize for being too rough about it, when you were both upset.", "YTA. \"You're a bad dog owner\" is completely unconstructive. Yes, she messed up, yes, she should have known better than to give chocolate to a dog but bertating a person who already knows they just fucked up bad is not the way to go.", "The part where you snap and let your emotion fly was out of line. But on the bright side, you did saved the dog. Hopefully the Vet know about that especially dogs I consider are family members too. I think being the better person might help here such as apologizing to her for snapping and helping her for the future rather then reminding the difficulty she had.", "Soft YTA. You did a good thing saving the dog. But people can't do anything about what they don't know that they don't know. If your sister had a habit of being careless around animals or neglectful, then I would say NTA, but it sounds like she just didn't know. There are many common household items which can be poisonous to pets, and most people only know one or two. If you look up a list I'm sure you will be surprised by at least a few. \n\nIf you are afraid you've damaged your relationship with your words, I don't think it would hurt to have a heart to heart with her. I don't know that an apology is required here, but it might not hurt.", "If the thing you wanted to teach you sister is, 'never make mistakes and definitely don't ask your sister for help,' congrats!\n\nYou did it!\n\n\nMore productive would have been, after all was calm, to spend some time together looking at common dog no-nos and helping her avoid a similar mistake.", "YTA that was not the time for it. Even though lots of comments are claiming that this is common knowledge, there are lots of people who don't know this. \n\nShe had just been through the stress of taking the dog to the emergency vet. I'm sure the vet told her about chocolate being bad for dogs. Yelling at her was just rubbing salt in the wound. \n\nShe isn't a bad dog owner because she didn't do it on purpose. She is an uneducated dog owner. Big difference.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

FYI", "I don't particularly like dogs (especially my sister's evil spawn), but even then I always remind my kids and mom not to feed it chocolate, milk, cooked bones from their plates etc. Even tho it's not mine I still keep track of what could kill/make sick the little demon, as an owner there's no way she didn't know chocolate is bad for the dog. Op's sister is some kind of human.", "It has to do with the amount of theobromine. Baking chocolate and dark chocolate can have a range of 130 mg per ounce all the way up to 450 mg per ounce. Hershey's kisses, as milk chocolate, is much, much lower. Though I suspect the caffeine in purer chocolates doesn't help either.", "My friend\u2019s dog (beagle) did that when we were kids.  Apparently poop patrol was easy for the next few days, given the shininess.", "yeah I feel like OP should've gave her sister a little bit of time before talking about it with her.

Sometimes it has chocolate in it, it always had sugar. She didn't think it would hurt the dog and was offended I said she was!\n\nThankfully the internet was able to back me up and I also pointed out the dog always had an upset tummy on the days she got the milk.
