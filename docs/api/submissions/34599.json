I have no siblings. Amy has a brother (Max - 40M) who has three kids, two sons (Leo 6 and Ryan 5) and a daughter (Anne 8). We have two kids (Sarah 7 and Ava 5). \n\nNow I love all of Max's children. And they get along really well with our kids. They constantly have sleepovers and play together, etc. Leo and Ryan are walking earthquakes. They're pretty active kids who enjoy physical activities much more than anything else. Anne is more laid back, and we have a special bond.\n\nFor example, my wife and I have a thing where we play chess or do crafts with our girls. Anne usually joins and asks us to sit with her. She also likes my profession (I'm an ENT doctor) and asks me all kinds of questions. (She loves the idea of being able to see inside one's nose and ear).\n\nFor Christmas, we got all of Max's kids a special gift. They came over for dinner one day during the holidays. Now I'd already gotten Anne her very own chess set around a month ago, and hadn't been able to give it to her because I kept forgetting it and it was in my office for a good while.\n\nHowever, I thought I'd just give her the gift while she was with us. Amy also agreed and said it would be a good idea and she could play chess with her friends etc. Max seemed to hate the idea. When the kids were gone he told me I was being sexist for clearly favoring his daughter, and said I needed to treat his kids equally.\n\nI said I just wanted to give a special gift, Amy took my side and said Max was being very petty about something as innocent as this. He is still upset with me. I wanted to apologise but Amy said I don't need to because I didn't do anything wrong. Was it an AH move to give her the chess set then?\n\nEdit: I got Leo all kinds of baseball stuff like bat, jersey, ball, etc. I got Ryan a bike. I knew they specifically like those activities. The original gift for Anne was a barbie dollhouse since she loved the movie, and I gave her this chess set later as something I bought a month ago", "created_utc": 1704715361, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/191jpk7/aita_for_obviously_favoring_of_my_niece/", "score": 781, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So it was obvious you had favored her.", "Reading your comments I say NTA\n\nYou bought the boys plenty Christmas gifts too so I don\u2019t see why an extra chess set gift is an issue.

I\u2019m sure those boys sometimes get things she doesn\u2019t.", "I think YTA in this situation. May be unpopular opinion. The reason is you shouldn\u2019t have excluded the other children if you are giving to one. You should have just made it it a gift to all 3 instead of just anne.

It sounds like the boys got a different number of gifts too -- one got multiple baseball things and one got a bike.

It's not like the dollhouse and chess set sound like something either boy would be jealous of in particular, since you describe them as being outdoorsy, active types", "NTA.

He has offered to take my daughter too, but she always nicely refuses because she\u2019s not interested. \n\nBecause my son loves fishing with him, my grandfather bought him a fishing rod as a random present. \n\nHe was worried my daughter would feel upset she wasn\u2019t getting something, but I used the opportunity to say sometimes people get an extra gift or present because of similar interests. \n\nMy son has also had this talk because my daughter has medical issues and has often received special presents from people, and my son didn\u2019t. \n\nThat\u2019s life, and while it\u2019s nice to do our best to be fair, it\u2019s an invaluable lesson to know life isn\u2019t fair and sometimes it\u2019ll be in your favor and sometimes it won\u2019t.", "NTA. I really don't think this was a big deal but you should have just lumped it in with the Christmas gifts. Were the other kids upset? If they were I assume you would have included that in your post. That is the only thing that could make you TA, but if they kids were fine then your BIL is making something out of nothing.", "NTA....  Why should you be forced to gift each child a gift, when you want to give one a special gift.  It's unreasonable.  In life ppl don't care if you get what you think your owed.  It's a good lesson for the children", "NTA. You are not the parent of these children. Of course you are allowed to have a favorite!", "Max talking about it being sexist is ridiculous. So he is an AH.\n\nAt first I was gonna say the jury is still out for you, but I decided soft NTA. You already bought gifts for all the kids, right? Then it is ok. The chess set is a specific gift for your niece who likes chess, the rest of the gifts are Christmas gifts. It is okay. Maybe you could have given it some other time so it does not look like your niece received more Christmas gifts than your nephews, which does show favoritism. \n\nIn general specific nephews/nieces can get different amounts of gifts through the year. You know, today you buy your niece a chess set, tomorrow you can take your nephews to a sports-game\u2026 In the end it does not need to be %100 equal, but it is important to keep track of it and not make it so blatantly unequal. This is just because they are kids. People are right that they will get hurt by this. If they were adults, I would say relationships are always different and some may involve more gift-giving than others\u2026 \n\nYou not being an asshole does not mean there would be no consequences, to remind you. If you have a favorite, then the nephews may rightfully get distant from you. Also, if their parents think their kids are affected by this, they may reduce your time with all of them. So I think you should not think about this in the context of being an asshole, but in the context of what you want and expect from your family. They are the way they are, if they feel you hurt their kids, you should make amends somehow. This may include talking with the parents and if necessary, the kids. If you took the nephews to a game, if you did other stuff for them, you can say \u201cI did give an extra gift to niece, but do you remember when we went out for the game? It is hard to compare time, energy and attention spent on relationships. We have a different bond with you then my niece, so what you receive from me will be different than her.\u201d \n\nThis depends on what kind of relationship you actually have with the nephews.", "YTA. You already know that, the title says it all. The father of the kids was right. It wasn't a bad thing to buy her a chessboard. Gift her that in Christmas gifts context was the AH move.\n\nEdit: typo.", "Either gifts for all of equal value (whether sentimental or financial value) or no gifts for all kids. You especially do not give one person a gift in front of everyone else. How would feel if someone gave one of your kids a present and nothing to the others in front of everyone?

Because that would be exactly the same situation, so just let yourself and Amy think about that for a moment before you both play innocent and pretend that the obvious favoritism isn\u2019t happening. Example - You\u2019d feel terrible and saddened on Ava\u2019s behalf if Sarah was gifted something extra and Ava just sat there puppy eyed waiting for a second gift that never came, but watching her elder sister getting something else. But maybe Max should do that, then maybe you\u2019ll see your own wrongdoings", "YTA\n\nIs it too much to ask for you to hang on to this cherished chess board for an extra month and present it to the golden child during Christmas, sparing us all the unnecessary drama? Oh, and of course, **your brother's brilliant insight is spot-on**. It seems you're ~~un~~intentionally contributing to the stereotype of the man-hating lesbian. You \"totally\" aren't playing into that toxic lesbian stereotype of only wanting to engage with female kids, and totally not exclude the male kids.", "yta", "You got his son a bike and he\u2019s upset you gave his daughter a chess set? As far as favoritism goes that\u2019s pretty mild. ESH", "ESH except the kids\n\nYou because imagine it was reverse. What if Max got Ava a super special gift but not Sarah? You'd be mad about it\n\nMax because you and her get along well and are close and came down kinda hard \n\nBasically everyone except the kids suck\n\n*Edit for positing too early*", "NTA. You're the aunt. Aunts are definitely allowed to have favorites lol. Plus, it was a chess set, not a laptop. I do get that that won't keep siblings from complaining that big sis got something they didn't, but by 3 kids you should be able to handle when things aren't 100% equal between them.", "Yta simply because those other kids didn't know that the chess set wasn't meant as a Christmas gift. So to them... you (a f with a f partner, who has f children) gave their sister 2 special gift and they only (the only 2 m children) got 1. Even if your intentions were 100% pure, it's really easy to have misconstrued the intention.", "Let me ask you this, if Max got one of your girls an extra thoughtful gift that she really wanted and gave it in front of your other daughter while she wondered why her uncle didn\u2019t care for her as much as for her sister - would you think that is fine? Would you think it was fine when you had to explain to your other kid that her uncle does love her, it\u2019s just that in his eyes she is second rate compared to her sister? \n\nYTA OP. The fact that Max said something means that this isn\u2019t the first time you and your wife have been thoughtless about your favouritism and that the kids have noticed. They most likely don\u2019t understand or know how to express what they are noticing but it is there like landmine waiting to go off.\n\nThere is no shame in having favourites. It\u2019s natural. But there is every shame in rubbing that favouritism in other kids faces. I have to wonder though, was your wife the golden child in the family?", "YTA - you should never give a gift to one child and leave out the others. That causes resentment. \n\nYou should\u2019ve given the chess set for \u2018the house\u2019 and then your niece could\u2019ve used it without causing issues.", "This would have been really easy to not be TA. Give all 3 kids their gift in front of each other, everyone is currently even. Then just pull their dad aside, \u201cHey I got this for niece a little bit ago but I forgot to give it to her until now.\u201c See what he thinks. Maybe he tells you it\u2019s okay, maybe he tells you to wait until a birthday or until christmas has passed, etc.", "YTA \n\nThe boys got a one special gift. Anna got two. There was no reason to go out and get Anna a second gift when you already had the chess set laying around for her.\n\nAlso OF COURSE Anna\u2019s gonna be more inclined to hang out with you, your wife, AND YOUR DAUGHTERS! Not only is she the older of her siblings by two years, but she\u2019s also the GIRL. \n\nThe boys who are similar in age have each other. Anna doesn\u2019t have the same bond with them as they have with each other. She doesn\u2019t have a sister of her own so obviously she\u2019s gonna gravitate towards you and your girls when she\u2019s at your house. It doesn\u2019t mean she loves you more her brothers do.", "YTA", "I don't see you as the AH but I don't see you as NTA\n\n\nAll of these people in the comments saying that you're favoring the girl too much is a little off to me, I don't really see it, but albeit I wasn't raised in a good setting for women. My younger sister and older brother were always favored more than me.\n\n\nYou bought it for her previously, and you kept forgetting, that's understandable.\n\n\nI had a lot of elderly neighbors that got me stuff for a few different Christmas, and yes they favored me over my brother, but he always received more. Yet my grandma would get upset when I'd get something and he didn't because it \"wasn't fair.\" But then again, if you wanted to get her something else and not her brothers, that's fine, kids don't need to get the same amount of presents. \n\n\nYou treated those kids equally, I'm sure the baseball stuff and bike both cost more than the doll house and chess sets, only the really nice professional chess sets and glass ones are at least a little expensive from what I remember. \n\n\nMax is definitely being petty, you don't need to apologize.", "NTA I don\u2019t see the favoritism but being that you have daughters I can see why the relationship would be different", "Well I think your bro is the AH here but I think it might be more to do with the fact that your a girl, married to a girl & have 2 girls.. \ud83d\ude02 I'm just putting it out there but maybe he either never liked your orientation (maybe he might even blame himself for it as some do) or maybe feels that you might end up influencing his only daughter esp since she seems to be fond of the both of you a lot.. \ud83e\udd14\n\nI'm just calling as I see it since I can kinda see how he might feel that your like totally a girl ally..

I don't feel that you overtly played favorites with the niece but pretty sure it didn't go down too well with your bro..\n\n1. I do think that favoritism is a very shitty thing esp when it comes to kids or parents but that's my view.\n2. Maybe you might change your view when those two grow up (though I have a feeling that they won't get a chance to be especially sensitive with their dad's mindset already)\n3. I feel max might have very much taken this out of context unless you clearly stated that you prefer the niece over the nephews in which case the gifts don't justify the sentiment though I doubt you would be that callous towards your brother.. \ud83d\ude05\n\nAnyway, think it might be a good time to ask him if he has anything deeper to share..\n\nHope things work out!
