The older gentleman immediately snatched his hand back and apologized profusely, which wasn't necessary but appreciated. On the other hand, the older woman sucked her teeth at me and threw the treats to my dog. Since he has training and a good \"out\" he just ignored them and came to me. I reiterated my request and why as politely as I could but she, instead, went on a tirade about how I shouldn't be moving into a neighborhood with dog lovers if I don't want my dog to be loved by them, that I was rude and that my dog was \"too skinny and looks abused\". Yes, he looks too skinny, he is. He was poisoned and lost a ton of weight! This sent me over the top and I yelled that I was going to build a privacy fence along our property lines so that she could never interact with my dogs or family again. This apparently wasn't the correct response, according to the person I'm buying the home from.

But you could provide neighbor with approved treats to give to your dog.", "I have this problem all the time. I live on a park and people are always feeding my dog treats. I think everyone thinks they're the only one who does it. They think they're being kind but the fact is the owner should ALWAYS be asked before treats are shared. I think it's sweet that you have neighbours who would love your dog. There was no need for the yelling. The lady was just surprised by what you said and reacted emotionally. Cut her some slack. It must have been shocking to have her new neighbour rejecting her kindness even though it was for a good reason. Maybe you can try to reset things with her. Write her a nice card with an apology for being so gruff and let her know you only reacted because you were so worried about your dog and how he is still recovering. Be sincere and be clear that your vet says no treats. Hopefully, it will help soften the first impression.", "I am so glad your dog survived being poisoned! Poor pupper. I hope he recovers well!\n\nAlso absolutely NTA. Being old doesn't excuse bad behavior, and trying to feed someone's animal without permission is not acceptable. You never know if someone's dog is allergic to something, for example! And as you said in an edit, your dog is on a special diet because the poisoning damaged his organs. Whatever this granny tried to give him could have made him worse!\n\nAnd your yelling was okay too, as you did it after explaining yourself first and she was being disrespectful.\n\nBut I don't think you should move there. I wouldn't want neighbours that intentionally put my dog in danger. And yes, as soon as you said no and she *threw the treats* she was being intentionally malicious. You didn't need to explain the poisoning or anything about the special diet, she should have done as you requested from the first time.", "NTA.   \n\nI sure hope your pup has a full recovery! \n\nI was staying at a friends home with my two dogs for the weekend.  We went out for dinner.   The home has a doggy door and a fenced yard.  The little one must have gotten out  by squeezing under the fence in one spot where a slat was broken.   A neighbor found him and called my host.  We rushed back - he was acting funny.   Then he was vomiting and with diarrhea.   He died !

Of course cars, predators and cats eating endangered animals are also major reasons, but cars are accidental and predators kill quickly (except cats, who play with their food). Humans intentionally torture cats with cruel methods.\n\nJust last year there were bunch of teens who hung a cat to a traffic sign, and blew one's head up with a firework. It's not known if the cats were alive at the start of those ordeals.", "  I  feel the woman would just feel like she could give any old treat or give too many if he did this..", "You know, of all the things you'd think would cross my mind in my profession, it didn't even occur to me in the moment that I had some in the car and could have offered that as an option.", "They were still very rude and disrespectful.

I love animals but understand they can have allergies or a reason the owner doesn\u2019t want them having something. It isn\u2019t her place to question that. And especially with the special diet, treats could be putting him at risk. I would write her a letter with certified mail and explain the situation more clearly if you want to clear the air. Apologize for blowing up, but be firm that he can not have treats due to the special diet after being poisoned. You are now very protective of him because he is a member of your family and would appreciate if she respected not giving him treats. Offer a compromise of petting him if you\u2019re feeling generous maybe, but definitely no food or treats. Again, this is only what I\u2019d do to clear the air but it might also make her feel vindicated and feel entitled to continue trying to feed your dog so tread carefully. \n\nAt the end of the day, though, I\u2019d build that fence. Good fences make good neighbors is a saying for a reason.", "NTA. For many owners, their dog is their child. I would be fucking furious if a stranger tried to feed my child something.", "NTA.  Put up the privacy fence.  She could have given your dog something deadly and you've delt with that scenario already. \n\nSend her a copy of your poisoning treatment vet bill.  If she's willing to reimburse for that, *then* she can give your dog treats.  If not, feck off!", "NTA. Her being there and the family not visiting isn't your problem in the slightest. If anything there's probably a reason the family doesn't come around (Like not respecting people's boundaries.) So what you need to OP, she doesn't own your property or your dog.", "Wow, way to introduce yourself to your soon-to-be neighbors before moving into their established neighborhood. I bet they're super excited to have you there. Don't get me wrong, I totally understand your side, and that one of your new neighbors essentially shrugged you off, she was probably embarrassed as well as taken aback by your reaction, but you could have handled it much better, especially being the newcomer.

Hmmm\u2026but, what I might do, to try and make good neighbors and stop over, introduce myself and explain why you are with your dog, the way you are.  And you would think, that being the dog lover that she says she is, she would not want to harm your dog by giving him treats he should not have, would she?  Said with smiles and politeness.   Do you have to do this?  No, but it might help living in a new neighborhood. Now, depending on her response is how I would proceed from here.  If she is still a beyotch, than install that fence and live your life.  If she is nice, you just might get home baked cookies.", "NTA\n\nNOTHING SWEET ABOUT HER BEING DISRESPECTFUL.\n\n\nBUILD THAT FENCE", "NTA\n\nThere is a reason her family don\u2019t visit.", "Well said. I can't add anything except NTA.", "OP asked them not to give treats to his dog. The lady then *threw them into the yard*. Yet OP stayed calm and repeated that his dog had just been poisoned. To which the lady said to not move there if you don't like dog lovers, and that *the dog is too skinny and looks abused*. After literally just being told he had been poisoned.\n\nI would say that yelling after that was absolutely justified. Not to mention that the dog is on special diet, and feeding him just whatever might cause his situation to get worse. Even without the poisoning, many dogs have allergies and it's just never a good idea or acceptable to feed someone's dog without permission.", "Yeah but you were already stressed in this situation because of what  your dog has been through. And then being accused of abusing him, I\u2019d go on the defence too.  \n\nMaybe you could try to make amends with the neighbour, to ease the tension, by writing a letter explaining what happened to your dog. It seems that despite her inappropriate behaviour, she likes dogs and hopefully would want the best for yours. \n\nIn any case, you were just protecting your dog, and people really should ask before giving a strange dog anything. \n\nNTA", "It sounds like you panicked a little all things considered. I could only imagine the fear and trauma you went through not sure if your boy would be okay or not so your reaction is understandable. Giving them a single treat to give him when you see them is a good idea so you have control over how many and what treats he gets but it might also open the door to them thinking if you\u2019re not there, their treats would be fine. The man sounds very respectful and nice but the woman concerns me that she would not be.", "That's not a bad idea. I certainly don't want unnecessary tension between us.", "NTA. While you probably shouldn't have exploded I get it. It's annoying repeating yourself especially about something serious. I would just make a peace offering, maybe flowers, and maybe offer to give her a bag of treats you pick out. So that way she can give your pup treats. And maybe you'll feel more comfortable b c you know it's the ones you got?", "NTA with small exception.  First, your dog is absolutely a priority here, and frankly, the neighbors should NEVER have offered him treats.  Attempted an introduction, a little love, yes, but even a non-dog person like me knows not to offer food to dogs that don\u2019t belong to you.  And definitely get that fence!  But you are new in that neighborhood and maybe - just maybe - you could have not yelled at the little old lady.  Not gonna deny that she was wrong in every way, but maybe a little less aggressive with the senior citizen.  Just a thought.", "NTA at all but I think I\u2019d have just said \u201cdon\u2019t feed him, he\u2019s in a special diet.\u201d", "Bulshit. And I'll tell you why. \n\nI am a dog lover. I just finished a 10 month internship in a dog groomers. I spent my whole life around dogs. I volunteer at the shelter and have worked in homemade pensions through out the summer. \n\nI never had a dog as I live in an apartment with my parents and they don't appreciate the idea of a dog in the house. Hence I'm not putting a platonic dog in such an environment as I see dogs as sort of equals rather than \"animals that have to stay out of the house\". \n\nMy neighbor has a 13 year old terrier mix. I grew up with her. I'd go to her house everyday as I was growing up and was like a human sister lol.\n\nI still ask her owner if I can give her a treat and show her both the ingredients on the package and the treat density as I would HATE to be the reason this dog gets ill. \n\nDogs can have health issues and allergies just like us. Aside from the poisoning part no person should ever give a dog a treat if not instructed from an owner. Just as much as no one should pet a dog without the owners permission. \n\nI am 25 years old now. I learned to ask to pet the dog when I was 2.5 as my mother tried everything to discourage me from petting unknown dogs as she didn't want me to get hurt. So I'd just ignore her when she'd say \"he's aggressive don't go there\" and ask the owner if the doggy was a good boy and could I pet him.\n\nI WAS TAUGHT BY THE OWNERS TO PET THE DOGS IN DIFFERENT WAYS THEY LIKED BASED ON THEIR DOGS. I now have a magic connection (I like to think that) where its based on respect with almost any dog. Because I eont go to them. I crouch down to their level while relatively far (at least 3 or 4 big steps away) and offer my hand. If the dog feels comfortable he'll walk over and smell my hand (yeah not always that happens. Most dogs find it trusty to see you at their level and I have been knocked over multiple times from playful pups.\n\nI also laugh when the owners are apologetic that their dog jumped on me and \"got me dirty\". As I honestly wouldn't expect anything different from an animal interaction. \n\nThis is loving dogs. Being respectful of the fact that they are living creatures that deserve a say in wether they want to be touched or not. \n\nAs per food, I wouldn't genuinely allow anyone to give my dog a treat. If they wanted to feed him a treat I'd happily give them a handful of the treats I buy for him as I cannot request them to buy the brand I get him. I also don't want my platonic dog to get sick due to some chemicals in the treats as I am very peculiar when it comes to dog treats. (No purina, pedigree or major cheap brands. I always check the ingredients and if they're not detailed to the percentage of which meat goes in it I don't get it. And all the treats I have in my bag (in the hopes of meeting dogs when I'm out) are single protein based and all in their packages with list of ingredients so I can ask and show the owners. Most don't really care for what I give them as \"they love food\" but I still try to be considerate of the dog. \n\nI know maybe I am a bit mental but I genuinely think it would be much better if everyone had a bit more consideration for other peoples feelings. \n\nAlso on another note, I'd like to point out that that nosy neighbors behaviour is probably the reason she has no one and no one visits.", "NTA. She has no this right to undermine you. If she continues notify the police and build your fence.", "NTA. I have a dog with an iron stomach who can (and will) eat anything. I still expect people to ask if they're allowed to give him treats. Our postie has only just started giving him treats when she delivers to us, and only after I said she could, and she makes him sit for them as I requested. Your dog needs a special diet due to kidney damage, and you are understandably not trusting a person you don't know who refused to listen to you.", "NTA.  Sit down with her and start the conversation with \"Look we got off on the wrong foot, however, you didn't listen to me when I shared that my dog had just been poisoned by a person in my old neighborhood.  That is why he looks so skinny and unhealthy.  He has organ damage and is now on a special diet.  Your treats aren't a part of his veterinary approved diet and could have caused a setback if he'd eaten them.  I was coming from a place of *protecting* my dog from another potential poisoner.  I didn't know who you were, can you really blame me for my reaction based off of what had already happened to my dog?\"\n\nIf she tries to defend herself and/or claim she didn't hear you say that your dog had been recently poisoned point out that the other neighbor heard what you had said about the dog being poisoned and stopped trying to give your dog treats.  She has no excuse.  If she doubles down, build the fence and put up a net to either catch the treats she tosses, or blocks them from going into your yard.\n\n> her family doesn't come around\n\nI wonder why.  I bet she boundary stomps with them as well and they cut her off.", "NTA but if you want to try and repair the relationship so you aren't living next to someone that hates you, you can try and bring over a baked good or something and just explain that your dog is skinny because someone in your old neighborhood poisoned him and now you're extremely cautious about people giving him food of any kind and that he needs to be on a special diet because of what that other person did. \n\nI know you said all this already but if you come from a point of \"I'm overly cautious about my dog\" in a measured way where she won't mistakenly think you're attacking Her, it could be best for everyone. But that's only if you want a relationship.", "NTA.  Get the tallest fence you can get.", "NTA  I am a dog lover and will pet anything that moves.  That being said, I never offer treats to another person's dog.  You will feel better, if you talk to her and apologize for yelling.  \n\nA tall fence when you have a dog is a good idea.  It will reduce unnecessary barking.  Limit the possibility of squirrel chasing, etc.  Make sure you know where your property lines are.  Check to see with your jurisdiction whether the next door neighbor's approval is necessary if you build on the property line (mine does).  Buy some Cat Fence In to stop the woman from throwing treats over the fence.  \n\nGood luck.", "Exactly. Hell, one of my dogs is allergic to chicken. I'd be annoyed if this lady gave him a treat without my permission. It causes him stomach issues, and he gets super itchy. Ever dealt with Great Dane diarrhea? It's not fun.\n\nEdit- added a line.", "You''re absolutely correct about most dogs here and I also appreciate speaking with a fellow handler. This guy is just my buddy, not one that I work with aside from demoing. Ironically, he's better with the elderly than I am apparently \ud83d\ude05. Typically I don't mind him getting treats but I've been pretty strict since there are millions of treats out there and I can't know all of their ingredients. The fence would just be a preventative measure and I'm sure if she wanted to she could find ways to get around my request. I'm definitely still going to put it up but I'm also going to try to have a reasonable conversation with her first. and the height of the fence would be determined by her response lol", "One of my dogs has IBD. If some asshole ignored me and fed my dog non-hypoallergenic treats I'd be shoveling the diarrhea onto their porch.", "lol, yeah she probably would.

I'm going to try to have an adult conversation with her rather than a screaming match.", "it's my fault for not making that clear in the post but we had the full discussion about why and that he is on a diet for it", "The gentleman lives on one side, and the lady lives on the other side.", "The end of our interaction, sure. I'd like to clarify that I was completely cordial up until she started berating me though. But thanks for your input!", "Put up a net to catch the treats she tries to chuck over the fence.", "Perhaps you could offer a way for her to play with your dog instead of feeding him treats. Does he like to play fetch?  Could she have a tennis ball she throws for him sometimes instead of treats?  That could ease your mind in that he\u2019s not getting unknown food (understandably frightening after the poisoning!) and your neighbor who loves dogs would have a way to positively interact with your dog that would make both her and the dog happy.", "Thanks for explaining all that. It seems like some have the impression thar I just started yelling, lol", "Cat Fence In has netting."]}
