I'm a K9 trainer and bring my dog pretty much everywhere so, of course, I brought him with me to our most recent inspection of the property after some work was done. The back yard is pretty sizable but it only has a 5ft picket fence. While I was inside I left my boy to roam the yard and caught my elderly neighbors on both sides trying to give him treats. I immediately paused the inspection and asked them not to feed my dog anything because he had recently been poisoned by a lunatic in my current neighborhood that targeted all the houses with dogs. The older gentleman immediately snatched his hand back and apologized profusely, which wasn't necessary but appreciated. On the other hand, the older woman sucked her teeth at me and threw the treats to my dog. Since he has training and a good \"out\" he just ignored them and came to me. I reiterated my request and why as politely as I could but she, instead, went on a tirade about how I shouldn't be moving into a neighborhood with dog lovers if I don't want my dog to be loved by them, that I was rude and that my dog was \"too skinny and looks abused\". Yes, he looks too skinny, he is. He was poisoned and lost a ton of weight! This sent me over the top and I yelled that I was going to build a privacy fence along our property lines so that she could never interact with my dogs or family again. This apparently wasn't the correct response, according to the person I'm buying the home from. He said that she's just a sweet old lady and doesn't get much interaction since she's a widower, her family doesn't come around, and she's the last house on the block that backs up into the woods. That I should have just let her give my dog treats and start off with a good relationship. I'm aware that my proposal was a bit extreme/abserd but I refuse to allow my dog to be put in that situation on top of the disrespect.\n\nTLDR: My new neighbor ignored my request and berated me after asking her not to feed my recently poisoned dog, so I threatened to build a fence and isolate her from interacting with my dogs or family.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that he's on a special diet because of the damage to his organs.", "created_utc": 1667820047, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yojsp4/aita_for_threatening_to_build_a_privacy_fence/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would would be pissed.\n\nI have a working dog.   My K9 has food allergies.   The wrong food can cause allergy flair ups, that mean week-long medical issues.    You had no idea what was on the treats she tried to feed your dog.   For me that is a total no go.\n    Second, in the program I work in, only the handler rewards the dog.    If too many people provide treats, the dog can loose motivation to do required work, if just anyone can give treats.    \n     Third, my dog is a true healthy weight.    You can see an outline of his ribs and feel them lightly if you rub your hand over the ribs.   He is at the perfect weight according to his vet, who praises his body condition.  Most American dogs are slighty overweight.   Many are obese, because their owners overfeed,, with out knowing it.    I have been told on numerous occasions my dog is too skinny or underweight.  \n   And yes your dog was skinny due to being poisoned but feeding rhe wrong thing then was even more critical.    Sorry but being a sad old lady doesn't excuse this.    Will a private fence keep her from free feeding treats all the time anyway?

But you could provide neighbor with approved treats to give to your dog.", "I have this problem all the time. I live on a park and people are always feeding my dog treats. I think everyone thinks they're the only one who does it. They think they're being kind but the fact is the owner should ALWAYS be asked before treats are shared. I think it's sweet that you have neighbours who would love your dog. There was no need for the yelling. The lady was just surprised by what you said and reacted emotionally. Cut her some slack. It must have been shocking to have her new neighbour rejecting her kindness even though it was for a good reason. Maybe you can try to reset things with her. Write her a nice card with an apology for being so gruff and let her know you only reacted because you were so worried about your dog and how he is still recovering. Be sincere and be clear that your vet says no treats. Hopefully, it will help soften the first impression.", "I am so glad your dog survived being poisoned! Poor pupper. I hope he recovers well!\n\nAlso absolutely NTA. Being old doesn't excuse bad behavior, and trying to feed someone's animal without permission is not acceptable. You never know if someone's dog is allergic to something, for example! And as you said in an edit, your dog is on a special diet because the poisoning damaged his organs. Whatever this granny tried to give him could have made him worse!\n\nAnd your yelling was okay too, as you did it after explaining yourself first and she was being disrespectful.\n\nBut I don't think you should move there. I wouldn't want neighbours that intentionally put my dog in danger. And yes, as soon as you said no and she *threw the treats* she was being intentionally malicious. You didn't need to explain the poisoning or anything about the special diet, she should have done as you requested from the first time.", "NTA.   \n\nI sure hope your pup has a full recovery! \n\nI was staying at a friends home with my two dogs for the weekend.  We went out for dinner.   The home has a doggy door and a fenced yard.  The little one must have gotten out  by squeezing under the fence in one spot where a slat was broken.   A neighbor found him and called my host.  We rushed back - he was acting funny.   Then he was vomiting and with diarrhea.   He died !  My vet said someone must have poisoned him.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop threatening, start doing.", "NTA - But you can give her the treats that your dog can eat without problem", "The biggest reason my cats are indoor-only is because of cruel humans. Of course cars, predators and cats eating endangered animals are also major reasons, but cars are accidental and predators kill quickly (except cats, who play with their food). Humans intentionally torture cats with cruel methods.\n\nJust last year there were bunch of teens who hung a cat to a traffic sign, and blew one's head up with a firework. It's not known if the cats were alive at the start of those ordeals.", "  I  feel the woman would just feel like she could give any old treat or give too many if he did this..", "You know, of all the things you'd think would cross my mind in my profession, it didn't even occur to me in the moment that I had some in the car and could have offered that as an option.", "They were still very rude and disrespectful. They should have absolutely asked you first if it's okay to give him anything. Your reaction was justified."]}
