The older gentleman immediately snatched his hand back and apologized profusely, which wasn't necessary but appreciated. On the other hand, the older woman sucked her teeth at me and threw the treats to my dog. Since he has training and a good \"out\" he just ignored them and came to me. I reiterated my request and why as politely as I could but she, instead, went on a tirade about how I shouldn't be moving into a neighborhood with dog lovers if I don't want my dog to be loved by them, that I was rude and that my dog was \"too skinny and looks abused\". Yes, he looks too skinny, he is. He was poisoned and lost a ton of weight! This sent me over the top and I yelled that I was going to build a privacy fence along our property lines so that she could never interact with my dogs or family again.

But you could provide neighbor with approved treats to give to your dog.", "I have this problem all the time. I live on a park and people are always feeding my dog treats. I think everyone thinks they're the only one who does it. They think they're being kind but the fact is the owner should ALWAYS be asked before treats are shared. I think it's sweet that you have neighbours who would love your dog. There was no need for the yelling. The lady was just surprised by what you said and reacted emotionally. Cut her some slack. It must have been shocking to have her new neighbour rejecting her kindness even though it was for a good reason. Maybe you can try to reset things with her. Write her a nice card with an apology for being so gruff and let her know you only reacted because you were so worried about your dog and how he is still recovering. Be sincere and be clear that your vet says no treats. Hopefully, it will help soften the first impression.", "I am so glad your dog survived being poisoned! Poor pupper. I hope he recovers well!\n\nAlso absolutely NTA. Being old doesn't excuse bad behavior, and trying to feed someone's animal without permission is not acceptable. You never know if someone's dog is allergic to something, for example! And as you said in an edit, your dog is on a special diet because the poisoning damaged his organs. Whatever this granny tried to give him could have made him worse!\n\nAnd your yelling was okay too, as you did it after explaining yourself first and she was being disrespectful.\n\nBut I don't think you should move there. I wouldn't want neighbours that intentionally put my dog in danger. And yes, as soon as you said no and she *threw the treats* she was being intentionally malicious. You didn't need to explain the poisoning or anything about the special diet, she should have done as you requested from the first time.", "NTA.   \n\nI sure hope your pup has a full recovery! \n\nI was staying at a friends home with my two dogs for the weekend.  We went out for dinner.   The home has a doggy door and a fenced yard.  The little one must have gotten out  by squeezing under the fence in one spot where a slat was broken.

I love animals but understand they can have allergies or a reason the owner doesn\u2019t want them having something. It isn\u2019t her place to question that. And especially with the special diet, treats could be putting him at risk. I would write her a letter with certified mail and explain the situation more clearly if you want to clear the air. Apologize for blowing up, but be firm that he can not have treats due to the special diet after being poisoned. You are now very protective of him because he is a member of your family and would appreciate if she respected not giving him treats. Offer a compromise of petting him if you\u2019re feeling generous maybe, but definitely no food or treats. Again, this is only what I\u2019d do to clear the air but it might also make her feel vindicated and feel entitled to continue trying to feed your dog so tread carefully. \n\nAt the end of the day, though, I\u2019d build that fence.

Do you have to do this?  No, but it might help living in a new neighborhood. Now, depending on her response is how I would proceed from here.

To which the lady said to not move there if you don't like dog lovers, and that *the dog is too skinny and looks abused*. After literally just being told he had been poisoned.\n\nI would say that yelling after that was absolutely justified. Not to mention that the dog is on special diet, and feeding him just whatever might cause his situation to get worse. Even without the poisoning, many dogs have allergies and it's just never a good idea or acceptable to feed someone's dog without permission.", "Yeah but you were already stressed in this situation because of what  your dog has been through. And then being accused of abusing him, I\u2019d go on the defence too.  \n\nMaybe you could try to make amends with the neighbour, to ease the tension, by writing a letter explaining what happened to your dog.

I could only imagine the fear and trauma you went through not sure if your boy would be okay or not so your reaction is understandable. Giving them a single treat to give him when you see them is a good idea so you have control over how many and what treats he gets but it might also open the door to them thinking if you\u2019re not there, their treats would be fine.

While you probably shouldn't have exploded I get it. It's annoying repeating yourself especially about something serious. I would just make a peace offering, maybe flowers, and maybe offer to give her a bag of treats you pick out. So that way she can give your pup treats. And maybe you'll feel more comfortable b c you know it's the ones you got?", "NTA with small exception.  First, your dog is absolutely a priority here, and frankly, the neighbors should NEVER have offered him treats.  Attempted an introduction, a little love, yes, but even a non-dog person like me knows not to offer food to dogs that don\u2019t belong to you.  And definitely get that fence!  But you are new in that neighborhood and maybe - just maybe - you could have not yelled at the little old lady.  Not gonna deny that she was wrong in every way, but maybe a little less aggressive with the senior citizen.  Just a thought.", "NTA at all but I think I\u2019d have just said \u201cdon\u2019t feed him, he\u2019s in a special diet.\u201d", "Bulshit. And I'll tell you why. \n\nI am a dog lover. I just finished a 10 month internship in a dog groomers. I spent my whole life around dogs. I volunteer at the shelter and have worked in homemade pensions through out the summer. \n\nI never had a dog as I live in an apartment with my parents and they don't appreciate the idea of a dog in the house. Hence I'm not putting a platonic dog in such an environment as I see dogs as sort of equals rather than \"animals that have to stay out of the house\". \n\nMy neighbor has a 13 year old terrier mix. I grew up with her. I'd go to her house everyday as I was growing up and was like a human sister lol.\n\nI still ask her owner if I can give her a treat and show her both the ingredients on the package and the treat density as I would HATE to be the reason this dog gets ill. \n\nDogs can have health issues and allergies just like us. Aside from the poisoning part no person should ever give a dog a treat if not instructed from an owner. Just as much as no one should pet a dog without the owners permission. \n\nI am 25 years old now. I learned to ask to pet the dog when I was 2.5 as my mother tried everything to discourage me from petting unknown dogs as she didn't want me to get hurt. So I'd just ignore her when she'd say \"he's aggressive don't go there\" and ask the owner if the doggy was a good boy and could I pet him.\n\nI WAS TAUGHT BY THE OWNERS TO PET THE DOGS IN DIFFERENT WAYS THEY LIKED BASED ON THEIR DOGS. I now have a magic connection (I like to think that) where its based on respect with almost any dog. Because I eont go to them. I crouch down to their level while relatively far (at least 3 or 4 big steps away) and offer my hand. If the dog feels comfortable he'll walk over and smell my hand (yeah not always that happens. Most dogs find it trusty to see you at their level and I have been knocked over multiple times from playful pups.\n\nI also laugh when the owners are apologetic that their dog jumped on me and \"got me dirty\". As I honestly wouldn't expect anything different from an animal interaction. \n\nThis is loving dogs. Being respectful of the fact that they are living creatures that deserve a say in wether they want to be touched or not. \n\nAs per food, I wouldn't genuinely allow anyone to give my dog a treat. If they wanted to feed him a treat I'd happily give them a handful of the treats I buy for him as I cannot request them to buy the brand I get him. I also don't want my platonic dog to get sick due to some chemicals in the treats as I am very peculiar when it comes to dog treats. (No purina, pedigree or major cheap brands. I always check the ingredients and if they're not detailed to the percentage of which meat goes in it I don't get it. And all the treats I have in my bag (in the hopes of meeting dogs when I'm out) are single protein based and all in their packages with list of ingredients so I can ask and show the owners. Most don't really care for what I give them as \"they love food\" but I still try to be considerate of the dog. \n\nI know maybe I am a bit mental but I genuinely think it would be much better if everyone had a bit more consideration for other peoples feelings. \n\nAlso on another note, I'd like to point out that that nosy neighbors behaviour is probably the reason she has no one and no one visits.", "NTA. She has no this right to undermine you. If she continues notify the police and build your fence.", "NTA. I have a dog with an iron stomach who can (and will) eat anything. I still expect people to ask if they're allowed to give him treats.

Your dog needs a special diet due to kidney damage, and you are understandably not trusting a person you don't know who refused to listen to you.", "NTA.  Sit down with her and start the conversation with \"Look we got off on the wrong foot, however, you didn't listen to me when I shared that my dog had just been poisoned by a person in my old neighborhood.  That is why he looks so skinny and unhealthy.  He has organ damage and is now on a special diet.  Your treats aren't a part of his veterinary approved diet and could have caused a setback if he'd eaten them.  I was coming from a place of *protecting* my dog from another potential poisoner.  I didn't know who you were, can you really blame me for my reaction based off of what had already happened to my dog?\"\n\nIf she tries to defend herself and/or claim she didn't hear you say that your dog had been recently poisoned point out that the other neighbor heard what you had said about the dog being poisoned and stopped trying to give your dog treats.

That being said, I never offer treats to another person's dog.  You will feel better, if you talk to her and apologize for yelling.  \n\nA tall fence when you have a dog is a good idea.  It will reduce unnecessary barking.  Limit the possibility of squirrel chasing, etc.  Make sure you know where your property lines are.

Typically I don't mind him getting treats but I've been pretty strict since there are millions of treats out there and I can't know all of their ingredients.

Does he like to play fetch?  Could she have a tennis ball she throws for him sometimes instead of treats?  That could ease your mind in that he\u2019s not getting unknown food (understandably frightening after the poisoning!) and your neighbor who loves dogs would have a way to positively interact with your dog that would make both her and the dog happy.", "Thanks for explaining all that.

I would bring her pastries or cookies and explain the full situation with the dog and that your reaction was due to that.  The poisoning, special diet, training to not accept food from strangers for it, etc.   She can easily throw things over a fence for your dog to find,  just isn't worth it IMO.", "Nta.

But aside from all that - it is not their dog, so not their decision to make.\n\nWe had problems with some guy feeding our dog (and other people's dogs) in a park near our home.  He had a bag of dog treats but we didn't know where they were from or if anything harmful had been added.  Our dog had a problem with salt crystals forming in her kidneys and was on a special low salt diet.  This guy would ignore any dog owner who asked him not to feed their dog, so we simply left the park if this idiot showed up.\n\nThe other downside to this is that if dogs are used to receiving treats from strangers, they will start to beg/demand treats from random people - and it is difficult to break this habit.  \nNTA", "NTA my neighbors give my dogs treats and now if they're outside I can't let him out to potty because he goes wild for them expecting more treats.

Then... let them get involved.  Let them know what IS safe for your dog and bring treats that ARE safe and allow her to offer them.

I live out in the country so my neighbors are few and far between but I wanted them to know who had moved in, what my dogs looked like, and how to contact me if they for some reason ended up seeing my dogs on their property. You don't want to create animosity with people you have to live next door to and even with 50 foot fences you've still created a hostile environment for you and your dog.

I know pretty much all the dogs in the neighborhood and their people, and both my dog and I are on very good terms with almost all of them. \n\n\nNo one in my neighborhood, regardless of how well they knew and got on with a dog and their people, would give any kind of food to a dog without explicitly clearing it with their person first, and definitely not after being told not to. \n\n\nWithout seeing it myself, I can\u2019t judge whether you\u2019re response was a little harsh, but clearly the old woman was not going to listen to anything gentle. I have a good friend who trains K9\u2019s, and I can\u2019t see him being any more gentle than you.", "NTA\n\nYour dog could have an allergy or be on a diet or on a training regimen. No one one is entitled to feed your dog. Most \u201cdog lovers\u201d know that you should always ask the owner before feeding or even interacting with a dog you don\u2019t know.", "Given the circumstances you describe.   Take her the special treats your dog is allowed and have a conversation with her to see if she can build your respect by only giving him the special treats he can have.", "NTA and your real estate agent is clearly bsing you because guess what \"sweet old\" anythings don't go on tirades when politely asked to respect boundaries and given a good reason.  Considering she's willing to respond this way to a complete strangers boundaries how do you think she treated her family back when they did come around?", "NTA.  \n\nLet's say she loves kids.  Would you want her going to your kid at the playground and saying 'here's a big plate of cupcakes, eat as many as you want?'  Of course not.  \n\nThis isn't really about dogs or loving dogs though.  It's about respect and boundaries.  You calmly asked her to please not feed your dog.  She apparently feels she has a right to treat YOUR dog.  If she wants to play with a dog she should get a dog of her own.  \n\nI'd suggest talk to the man-- try to impress on him how important it is that neither of them feed or treat your dogs.  Tell him you don't want to build a fence, and you want to be friendly neighbors with them, but it is absolutely essential that neither of them feed or treat the dogs.  So if you and them can have an understanding that the dogs get left alone, you won't need the fence and perhaps can even have some structured playtime with the dogs and his wife.  Have him talk to his wife and see if she agrees, and if she does agree you need to hear it from her that she promises to never give the dogs any food or treats without your permission.  \n\nAlso get some cameras.", "NTA my son's neighbors fed his dogs all sorts of stuff including the foil containers over the fence too, and one had to be put down likely due to issues from them.", "This! But also I always find it pretty telling when someone older doesn\u2019t have any family or friends to come around, either. Sounds like boundary stomping might be a hobby of hers.", "WTF, I just\u2026I hate humans sometimes, the level of cruelty that humans are capable of is just sickening. You have to be very mentally sick or a horrible human being to gain the trust of an animal so you can then hurt it. How did you find out it was your neighbor and did you ever confront them or report it? I\u2019m curious about what repercussions for some mthing like that would be.", "> I was coming from a place of protecting my dog from another potential poisoner.\n\nYour heart is in the right place but if you think calling the woman a \u2018potential poisoner\u2019 isn\u2019t going to set her off again then you\u2019re mad. I think you have the right approach but the wording here will need considerable work. The objective should be to try and get the neighbor onside with protecting the dog, not further antagonising her.", "Lol, well don't be like me and wind up yelling, but your bf is absolutely wrong. It's not rude to ask them. It's clearly created behavioral issues that affect your lives now. Hopefully you all can figure out a way to stop this. it's not safe or healthy.", "Thank you, we got so lucky. A few of my neighbor's dogs didn't make it through. I'm so sorry you had to experience this and that your little baby was taken from you. People are so cruel, and for what?!", "It seems you're under the impression that I didn't explain the situation calmly. I did, twice, before she started berating me and threw the treats in the yard anyway. I do plan to go over and have a conversation with her though. FTMP I stay to myself and don't really engage in neighborhood politics, but i'd prefer not to have any unnecessary tension.", "A few years back after I adopted/trained Andy, he and a few clients worked the crowd for a dinner event. It was going great (He wound up sticking his head up a woman's dress. it was hilarious, she died laughing) but this guy started following one of my clients and her Dane around. He was convinced that, for some reason, the woman was mean to her dog because he hadn't seen her give the dog treats or table scraps. So he literally jumped in front of her with a plate full of food and gave it to the dog. The Dane went into anaphylaxis because of her severe allergies. The dog was even wearing a vest that said \"Don't feed me\" and an allergy warning. She survived though! There are some people out there that feel so entitled to your dog and think they know what's best. Been doing this for close to 15 years and I'm still surprised.", "As someone who has, in fact, dealt with Great Dane diarrhea in both a private setting and during a brief stint as a vet office assistant, you have my condolences! Hope the big good boy is doing ok!", "Oh God, I have. It's more effective to just grab a hose rather than a mop lol", "I have two Danes, both are allergic to grain, one is also allergic to chicken. \n\nIt's SO. MUCH. POOP.", "If you are worried about her throwing things over a higher fence... I recommend planting a dense hedge. They can get very tall without getting you in trouble over height limits.", "Oh my God! I'm going to hug my kitties. That's awful.", "You're not lying, I have literally done that.", "NTA. Did you tell her about the special diet because of the damage to his organs? I agree with you not wanting extra treats. She might not be as offended or nasty. Some people don't get pet owners. Had the same issue with poison where I live.", "NTA. Never, ever, ever feed someone else\u2019s animals without express permission and even then I would ask before every instance. This includes dogs, cats, horses, cows, goats, sheep, pigs, birds, anything breathing that is on the other side of the fence from you. There is zero excuse. \n\nBuild the fence. And put a net along the top to catch whatever treat she throws over.", "NTA, I kind of feel like one though now. My neighbor has a little dog that barks all. The. Time. And I got a big dog recently and the poor little thing went from barking to just yipping and crying when my dog would approach the shared fence (always friendly and wanting to play) so while I was training my dog I\u2019d sometimes give the little neighbor dog a treat as well when my dog came up to the fence to say hello. They are both happy with each other now and neither of them bark much anymore and the little dog is always happy to see either of us now. I probably should have asked my neighbor permission though in hindsight\u2026", "NTS but if you want to mend fences with your neighbor (I'm so sorry for the person I am with that joke) I would head to her place with a plate of homemade cookies. And explain to her that your dog was recently deathly ill from a \"treat\" a malicious neighbor fed him and now you're extra sensitive to who feeds him and what. Maybe gift her treats you approve of and give her a limit for how many a day?", "NTA, but you've gotten off on a terrible footing with your new neighbors. Is it too late to cancel the sale and look for a home in a different neighborhood? You've likely made an enemy of that lady, unfortunately.", "ESH.\n\nShe's being shitty by refusing to respect you with regard to your dog's training (poisoning completely aside, \"leave it\" and not taking treats from strangers should be part of any training program).\n\nBut really? Jumping straight to \"I'mma build a privacy fence so you can never interact with my family or my dog again\" before you've even moved in... is frankly kind of a psycho move. \n\nI mean, there has just GOT to be a better way for civilized adults to have that conversation.", "NTA, I don't care how nice she is you don't feed someone else's animal without their permission.  You have no way of knowing what issues they have and what decent person would risk hurting a dog especially one who claims to be a dog lover. If she wanted to be a good neighbor she would have done as the other gentleman did.", "NTA. We built a privacy fence because our neighbors wouldn\u2019t stop having conversations with each other over our yard.", "NTA, but your delivery sucked.  The correct response would have been to go over and let them know that your dog was recently poisoned by someone in your old neighborhood who targeted all dogs.  That you were extremely lucky he survived, but he is now on a very specialized diet due to organ damage and anything that may contain something he can\u2019t have could cause him further injury or death.  Let them know that with the vet\u2019s guidance, you are working on rebuilding his weight safely.  That you would be happy to bring him to meet them another time, but please don\u2019t feed him anything.  Yes, people like that don\u2019t often listen.  You went on an accusatory rant the first time they met you and your behavior sounded psycho.", "NTA. Old lady is unhinged. It was a simple request and SHE turned it into this sh\\*tshow. She owes you an apology.", "NTA\n\nBut I'd approach the neighbor again and explain your reaction.\n\n\"I wanted to explain my side of our previous meeting. You noticed my dog was skinny, the reason for this is my previous neighbor used treats to maliciously poison my dog and other dogs in the neighborhood. I spent many many hours at the vet's office trying to keep my dog alive, and seeing someone unknown giving him treats brought me right back to that time I thought I was going to lose him. I understand that you probably were not trying to poison Fluffy, and I apologize if my reaction upset you. But because of the poisoning, Fluffy is on a very restrictive diet because his organs nearly shut down. If you really want to give him treats on occasion, I can tell you about/ buy you a bag of the veterinarian approved treats that won't make him sicker, and you can occasionally give him treats if you promise to only use that brand. Using another brand might literally kill him, and I love my dog very much. Would you like to come on a walk with us sometime?\"", "NTA. I\u2019ve never had someone offer a treat to my dogs (I\u2019ve had more than a few) without asking permission first. \n\nOn the other hand, this neighbor could have been my 92 yo nana before she passed. There was no convincing the woman that feeding treats to neighbor dogs or ducks at the lake was a bad idea. Even when her neighborhood banned feeding the ducks explicitly\u2026she would still do it! Even roped me in once\u2026of course that\u2019s the time a cop is there enforcing the rules lol. That woman was so stubborn!\n\nEdit: typo", "8", "NTA. Mines currently on a diet (oops), and while we occasionally give her things off the diet, I was beyond pissed when friends just handed her food off their plate. \n\nWithout asking \n\nAnd then told me I didn't see that.

My gf also suggested that I should offer to bring her along to one of the homes we do therapy work at once he's fully recovered so she'll get some dog love and possibly make some friends.", "I did, and I explained the situation and why I was against treating him...twice.", "Hindsights 20/20 \ud83d\ude05. I never really judge someone when they do these things unless they've been asked not to, obviously. it's social conditioning. My mentor used to say \"you're not wrong until you've been told not to but you do it again\".", "His training was only referenced to say that he didn't eat the stuff she threw. Leave it commands are definitely important skills, but unless you're training your dog for work or show there's no real reason to teach them not to take treats. It's up to their handler to decide if they can and advocate for them if they can't, imo. Let's be honest, they're opportunistic creatures. Unless you're around to stop them, the dog is taking the treat. Training be damned. \n\nAside from that, I do agree that I chose the nuclear option. To me, her \"good intentions\" were just threatening my dog's life. In that moment that's all that mattered. I will be attempting a civilized conversation when I go back next Monday", "\"I reiterated my request and why\"\n\nI don't think you understood my post. I explained those things twice, politely.

And start looking for a lawyer. Hopefully it's just a waste of money and your neighbor calms down. But get cameras and a lawyer immediately. \n\nIf nothing else, you might need to get lawyer to send her a registered letter so you can get her charged with animal cruelty if she poisons your dog with the wrong treats. Otherwise she will turn up the waterworks and claim she didn't know.", "The thing is she can't argue with the facts, and I bet that's why she went off on OP already.  OP told her that his dog had been poisoned and she *heard* him say that.  She heard him because the other neighbor also heard him, and the other neighbor stopped trying to give treats to the dog and apologized.  I bet what was running through her mind was \"He's accusing *me* of trying to poison his dog!  How dare he!  I'm going to give this dog these treats to prove I'm not a poisoner.\"  People like her you can't win with, but you can cause them to lose credibility with their friends when they complain to them about it and get the response \"Can you blame them.

I'm a fur mommy myself and I'd probably be the same way. But I also have a soft spot for older people, and while it doesn't excuse her response to you, I also get why she herself got irked.
