I'm a K9 trainer and bring my dog pretty much everywhere so, of course, I brought him with me to our most recent inspection of the property after some work was done. The back yard is pretty sizable but it only has a 5ft picket fence. While I was inside I left my boy to roam the yard and caught my elderly neighbors on both sides trying to give him treats. I immediately paused the inspection and asked them not to feed my dog anything because he had recently been poisoned by a lunatic in my current neighborhood that targeted all the houses with dogs. The older gentleman immediately snatched his hand back and apologized profusely, which wasn't necessary but appreciated. On the other hand, the older woman sucked her teeth at me and threw the treats to my dog. Since he has training and a good \"out\" he just ignored them and came to me. I reiterated my request and why as politely as I could but she, instead, went on a tirade about how I shouldn't be moving into a neighborhood with dog lovers if I don't want my dog to be loved by them, that I was rude and that my dog was \"too skinny and looks abused\". Yes, he looks too skinny, he is. He was poisoned and lost a ton of weight! This sent me over the top and I yelled that I was going to build a privacy fence along our property lines so that she could never interact with my dogs or family again. This apparently wasn't the correct response, according to the person I'm buying the home from. He said that she's just a sweet old lady and doesn't get much interaction since she's a widower, her family doesn't come around, and she's the last house on the block that backs up into the woods. That I should have just let her give my dog treats and start off with a good relationship. I'm aware that my proposal was a bit extreme/abserd but I refuse to allow my dog to be put in that situation on top of the disrespect.\n\nTLDR: My new neighbor ignored my request and berated me after asking her not to feed my recently poisoned dog, so I threatened to build a fence and isolate her from interacting with my dogs or family.\n\nEdit: I forgot to mention that he's on a special diet because of the damage to his organs.", "created_utc": 1667820047, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yojsp4/aita_for_threatening_to_build_a_privacy_fence/", "score": 87, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I would would be pissed.\n\nI have a working dog.   My K9 has food allergies.   The wrong food can cause allergy flair ups, that mean week-long medical issues.    You had no idea what was on the treats she tried to feed your dog.   For me that is a total no go.\n    Second, in the program I work in, only the handler rewards the dog.    If too many people provide treats, the dog can loose motivation to do required work, if just anyone can give treats.    \n     Third, my dog is a true healthy weight.    You can see an outline of his ribs and feel them lightly if you rub your hand over the ribs.   He is at the perfect weight according to his vet, who praises his body condition.  Most American dogs are slighty overweight.   Many are obese, because their owners overfeed,, with out knowing it.    I have been told on numerous occasions my dog is too skinny or underweight.  \n   And yes your dog was skinny due to being poisoned but feeding rhe wrong thing then was even more critical.    Sorry but being a sad old lady doesn't excuse this.    Will a private fence keep her from free feeding treats all the time anyway?

But you could provide neighbor with approved treats to give to your dog.", "I have this problem all the time. I live on a park and people are always feeding my dog treats. I think everyone thinks they're the only one who does it. They think they're being kind but the fact is the owner should ALWAYS be asked before treats are shared. I think it's sweet that you have neighbours who would love your dog. There was no need for the yelling. The lady was just surprised by what you said and reacted emotionally. Cut her some slack. It must have been shocking to have her new neighbour rejecting her kindness even though it was for a good reason. Maybe you can try to reset things with her. Write her a nice card with an apology for being so gruff and let her know you only reacted because you were so worried about your dog and how he is still recovering. Be sincere and be clear that your vet says no treats. Hopefully, it will help soften the first impression.", "I am so glad your dog survived being poisoned! Poor pupper. I hope he recovers well!\n\nAlso absolutely NTA. Being old doesn't excuse bad behavior, and trying to feed someone's animal without permission is not acceptable. You never know if someone's dog is allergic to something, for example! And as you said in an edit, your dog is on a special diet because the poisoning damaged his organs. Whatever this granny tried to give him could have made him worse!\n\nAnd your yelling was okay too, as you did it after explaining yourself first and she was being disrespectful.\n\nBut I don't think you should move there. I wouldn't want neighbours that intentionally put my dog in danger. And yes, as soon as you said no and she *threw the treats* she was being intentionally malicious. You didn't need to explain the poisoning or anything about the special diet, she should have done as you requested from the first time.", "NTA.   \n\nI sure hope your pup has a full recovery! \n\nI was staying at a friends home with my two dogs for the weekend.  We went out for dinner.   The home has a doggy door and a fenced yard.  The little one must have gotten out  by squeezing under the fence in one spot where a slat was broken.   A neighbor found him and called my host.  We rushed back - he was acting funny.   Then he was vomiting and with diarrhea.   He died !  My vet said someone must have poisoned him.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nStop threatening, start doing.", "NTA - But you can give her the treats that your dog can eat without problem", "The biggest reason my cats are indoor-only is because of cruel humans. Of course cars, predators and cats eating endangered animals are also major reasons, but cars are accidental and predators kill quickly (except cats, who play with their food). Humans intentionally torture cats with cruel methods.\n\nJust last year there were bunch of teens who hung a cat to a traffic sign, and blew one's head up with a firework. It's not known if the cats were alive at the start of those ordeals.", "  I  feel the woman would just feel like she could give any old treat or give too many if he did this..", "You know, of all the things you'd think would cross my mind in my profession, it didn't even occur to me in the moment that I had some in the car and could have offered that as an option.", "They were still very rude and disrespectful. They should have absolutely asked you first if it's okay to give him anything. Your reaction was justified.", "NTA, but you know she will throw the treats over the fence, right?", "NTA. I love animals but understand they can have allergies or a reason the owner doesn\u2019t want them having something. It isn\u2019t her place to question that. And especially with the special diet, treats could be putting him at risk. I would write her a letter with certified mail and explain the situation more clearly if you want to clear the air. Apologize for blowing up, but be firm that he can not have treats due to the special diet after being poisoned. You are now very protective of him because he is a member of your family and would appreciate if she respected not giving him treats. Offer a compromise of petting him if you\u2019re feeling generous maybe, but definitely no food or treats. Again, this is only what I\u2019d do to clear the air but it might also make her feel vindicated and feel entitled to continue trying to feed your dog so tread carefully. \n\nAt the end of the day, though, I\u2019d build that fence. Good fences make good neighbors is a saying for a reason.", "NTA. For many owners, their dog is their child. I would be fucking furious if a stranger tried to feed my child something.", "NTA.  Put up the privacy fence.  She could have given your dog something deadly and you've delt with that scenario already. \n\nSend her a copy of your poisoning treatment vet bill.  If she's willing to reimburse for that, *then* she can give your dog treats.  If not, feck off!", "NTA. Her being there and the family not visiting isn't your problem in the slightest. If anything there's probably a reason the family doesn't come around (Like not respecting people's boundaries.) So what you need to OP, she doesn't own your property or your dog.", "Wow, way to introduce yourself to your soon-to-be neighbors before moving into their established neighborhood. I bet they're super excited to have you there. Don't get me wrong, I totally understand your side, and that one of your new neighbors essentially shrugged you off, she was probably embarrassed as well as taken aback by your reaction, but you could have handled it much better, especially being the newcomer. YTA because you behaved like an asshole.", "NTA\u2026but who was the older gentleman if she is a widower?   Hmmm\u2026but, what I might do, to try and make good neighbors and stop over, introduce myself and explain why you are with your dog, the way you are.  And you would think, that being the dog lover that she says she is, she would not want to harm your dog by giving him treats he should not have, would she?  Said with smiles and politeness.   Do you have to do this?  No, but it might help living in a new neighborhood. Now, depending on her response is how I would proceed from here.  If she is still a beyotch, than install that fence and live your life.  If she is nice, you just might get home baked cookies.", "NTA\n\nNOTHING SWEET ABOUT HER BEING DISRESPECTFUL.\n\n\nBUILD THAT FENCE", "NTA\n\nThere is a reason her family don\u2019t visit.", "Well said. I can't add anything except NTA.", "OP asked them not to give treats to his dog. The lady then *threw them into the yard*. Yet OP stayed calm and repeated that his dog had just been poisoned. To which the lady said to not move there if you don't like dog lovers, and that *the dog is too skinny and looks abused*. After literally just being told he had been poisoned.\n\nI would say that yelling after that was absolutely justified. Not to mention that the dog is on special diet, and feeding him just whatever might cause his situation to get worse. Even without the poisoning, many dogs have allergies and it's just never a good idea or acceptable to feed someone's dog without permission.", "Yeah but you were already stressed in this situation because of what  your dog has been through. And then being accused of abusing him, I\u2019d go on the defence too.  \n\nMaybe you could try to make amends with the neighbour, to ease the tension, by writing a letter explaining what happened to your dog. It seems that despite her inappropriate behaviour, she likes dogs and hopefully would want the best for yours. \n\nIn any case, you were just protecting your dog, and people really should ask before giving a strange dog anything. \n\nNTA", "It sounds like you panicked a little all things considered. I could only imagine the fear and trauma you went through not sure if your boy would be okay or not so your reaction is understandable. Giving them a single treat to give him when you see them is a good idea so you have control over how many and what treats he gets but it might also open the door to them thinking if you\u2019re not there, their treats would be fine. The man sounds very respectful and nice but the woman concerns me that she would not be.", "That's not a bad idea. I certainly don't want unnecessary tension between us."]}
