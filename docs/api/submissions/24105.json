Good luck and I think everything will work out.\n\nAlso, your stepdad has paid your bills for 8 years and you shouldn't speak to him like that.", "INFO: What was the stupid mistake that sent your dad to prison?

You are very young and although he may have been blackmailed, he is just around the wrong people, and if you were with him, you would be around the wrong people.\n\nJust as a matter of course, you may want to be wary of people who are THAT unlucky.", "Need more info before i can descide.

I know it\u2019s an emotional issue, but accusations and raised voices (by you and them) will not accomplish your goal. If you really get shut down, just hold on because in 4 years you\u2019ll be free to do what you want. Keep your head down, get good grades, save money if you can, so you\u2019re in a good position to decide your future. If you get mad and act out, you\u2019ll just put yourself in a bad position to control your life (Ask me how I know this lol).\n\nIf you can\u2019t live with your dad, just do your best to talk to him as much as you can. Text him, game with him (if you\u2019re both into that), and it\u2019s old school but maybe even sit down and write him letters. That shows effort and trust me, you\u2019ll both treasure them years from now. \n\nTLDR If things don\u2019t go your way with custody, just do your best to put yourself in a position to move on with your life when you turn 18.

Does that mean your father has been showing up at your home unannounced and expecting to see you? If so, that's not acceptable unless your mother has agreed to it.\n\nWhy do you want to stay with someone who hasn't been there for you over the years, who cared so little about his family that he got himself sent to prison? \n\nYou mention he was blackmailed, and since going to prison has cut off contact with the people who did it. If he's capable of cutting them off now, he'll have been capable of doing it back then. It's as simple as that, he always had that choice but he chose a criminal lifestyle over you. Someone who cared that much about their child wouldn't allow themselves to be blackmailed into 8 years away from their child. If he truly was being blackmailed, he could've gone to the police before committing the crime. His actions suggest that he was in on it, and hoping to get a cut of the money.\n\nMy father was in and out of prison for most of my childhood, but I'm glad my mother allowed us to see him (never in prison though, she didn't want her children in that environment.) It meant I could learn firsthand how unreliable and selfish he was, because my siblings and I had all gone through a phase where we thought my mum was in the wrong. Before we knew my father properly, he seemed like a good person (he was incredibly charming) and that my mother was being spiteful. When we had the chance to see how he dealt with things, we all soon realised otherwise, and I'm forever grateful that it was my mum who raised us. \n\nI know it's not nice being told that your father doesn't care about you as much as you thought, but actions speak far louder than words. Have you spoken to a therapist, counsellor or friend about this? Someone you can discuss it with that isn't one of your parents. I don't want you to make a rash decision that you'll regret, and it seems your mother has your best interests at heart.", "If your mother didn\u2019t love you, she would let you go live with a violent criminal who has shown he will pick a chance at quick money over being an active parent in the life of his child. She is fighting to keep you safe.

That you believe your mom will take out her anger with your dad on you whenever you have been with your dad.", "YTA. How has your mom lied? You say he was convicted for assisting in an armed robbery. You say he trusted the wrong people (aka hung around with criminals). Could that have had anything to do with her not thinking well about him? If I had an ex who hung around criminals (even if he was just too naive to understand how dangerous they were), I'd be pretty worried and not particularly exited to have my kid around that.\n\nI understand you love your dad, but your mom loves you too, and she's clearly afraid for you whether that is required anymore or not. If home life is OK, I'd really recommend asking to live one week in one house and one week in the other. You get to deepen your relationship with your dad and feel out how living with him is without cutting your mom off. Unless there are other underlying issues with your mom, I'm afraid you'll regret hurting your relationship with her after feelings have cooled down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

That's a completely unreasonable request of her and not something you should be holding up as an example of her malice.\n\nSecond, if your mum permitted you to visit your father's family every weekend then she's definitely been at least passively supportive of you forming strong family relationships - a court order wouldn't have granted them anywhere near that level of access. \n\nThird, ppl don't fall into armed robberies. They aren't mistakes. At some point your father made choices that lead down this road. Those choices meant that unless your father was a very wealthy man that your mother has been solely supporting you - probably with significant financial support from her husband - the entire time your father has been incarcerated. Your father's 'mistake' put a horrible burden on your mother and while you might forgive that she doesn't have to.\n\nFourth, if your father was involved with ppl that would use blackmail to coerce a person to assist in committing a violent offence then your mum had a very good reason to try to deny him access to you as a child. \n\nFinally, there are two sides to every coin. Your paternal family are probably predisposed to being more compassionate and forgiving of your father - after all they don't really suffer the consequences of his actions. Your mother - who probably didn't receive any child support the entire time he was locked away - is not going to view him with the same rose tinted glasses. Just because they tell different stories does mean your mother is lying, I'm positive she saw a completely different side to him then they did.\n\nI've been a family lawyer a long time. I know very few ppl who after such a long period of incarceration are ready to resume parental responsibility of a minor after only 6 months released. Your mum is entitled to be very angry at your father. You may love him and forgive him, she's doesn't have to. His mistakes affected her more than anyone and if you don't understand that then one-day when you have to pay your own rent, electric and food you will. Nothing you have said suggests your mum hasn't at least tried to act in your best interests. Please consider whether your father is actually ready to be your primary carer - does he have his owned seperate accommodation, well paying job, vehicle, bank account, is he on probation or subject to any restrictions in movement that will impact his ability to care for you.

I can see why your mom is worried.", "Yeah, going to prison tends to have that effect.  Usually you break contact with almost everybody.  Your father participated in an armed robbery.  You are unequivocally taking his version of the account and disbelieving all others.  I have a tough time calling a 14 yr old an asshole, but you seem blinded by the lost love of your father.  He has been locked up for 7 years, and is in no position to raise a daughter.  YTA", "A simple smash and grab would not net 7 years even if he had a long criminal record.", ">  I don't think he's the good guy here.   \n    \nWhile that may be true, we only know that he was in prison, not what he is like now.  He may still be a deadbeat, or he may have turned his life around, it is obvious that the OP doesn't think he is an issue.   \n    \nMeanwhile, we have a mom who has done everything to alienate her kid, and when she doesn't get what she wants from the kid, punishes them.  It doesn't surprise me the OP wants out.", "\ud83d\ude02 you have no idea how the justice system works in a \u201ctough on crime\u201d jurisdiction. Especially if you\u2019re poor. \n\nJust one example is of Timothy Jackson who in 1996 was sentenced to life in prison without parole at 36 for stealing a $159 jacket. Granted with inflation the cost is that jacket would be higher. According to the BLS that amount is up to a whopping $314. In prison for life. \n\nSo no, I have little to no faith that if someone is convicted and sentenced harshly that they actually deserved it. There absolutely have been people put to death in the US that were innocent. Some of which there was known evidence supporting their innocence prior to their execution, but the justice system doesn\u2019t care if you\u2019re poor. \n\nEspecially in a trigger happy state like Texas. The example I\u2019m thinking of was a guy convicted of murdering his family based on junk science and murdered by the state of Texas in 2004. They knew it was junk science and they wanted to kill him so they did.", "Just doing a very quick google search shows Timothy Jackson had already committed 3 felonies at the time of stealing that jacket.\n\nNot saying i agree with the sentence  he got, but that's a very crucial piece of information to miss out. If he didn't commit three felonies prior to stealing the jacke,  he wouldn't have been convicted as a habitual offender, and the sentence would have been much more lenient.", "He must have had a criminal record already. Someone with a clean record doesn\u2019t get life for simple theft in a Western jurisdiction without other factors.", "Do you have a case in mind?", "You initially said he was blackmailed to do it. Then you said he trusted the wrong people. So you keep changing the reasons why armed robbery getaway driver is somehow \"not actually his fault\" but I doubt he was told to drive at gunpoint, so on some level he did *choose* to do this crime \n\n...I feel like you're whitewashing it because you want your dad back in your life. It's an understandable desire, but he can be back in your life and also be a very flawed human who made a huge mistake that cost him his relationship with you for seven years. I'm sorry he wasn't there for you because of it OP, and I'm sorry your mom didn't let you visit him.", "The US courts also stole my grubhub order", "So THAT'S where my Crunchwrap Supreme went last Friday"]}
