So I would not expect your mom to have visited him in jail. In fact, that would have just been awkward.  I am glad you got to visit your dad with your uncle.\n\nI feel like I don't have enough information to say who TA is, or if anyone is in this situation. \n\nGood luck, OP.", "There are things you don't know. I'm not saying I do know them, I'm just saying that no one in these situations tell an accurate story. Your dads family will always think he is better than he is and your mother will always worry about your safety. I think the best thing you can do is stay with your dad before a custody hearing and see what it's like to live there  because it may be a case not getting what you think you're going to get. Good luck and I think everything will work out.\n\nAlso, your stepdad has paid your bills for 8 years and you shouldn't speak to him like that.", "INFO: What was the stupid mistake that sent your dad to prison? How long was he there? Is it possible your mother is actually trying to protect you?", "I don't really think there is an asshole here. All I can say is that if my ex-husband was an accessory to armed robbery and spent 7 years in prison, I wouldn't let him be alone with our child for at least a year, after prison release.\n\nSure, I would let you visit him in prison because he's your father and I would let you see him with me, but no way alone. You are very young and although he may have been blackmailed, he is just around the wrong people, and if you were with him, you would be around the wrong people.\n\nJust as a matter of course, you may want to be wary of people who are THAT unlucky.", "Need more info before i can descide. Why did your dad go to prison? How do you know what your mom is saying about him is all a lie? Maybe she is trying to protect you?", "NTA you are old enough to determine where you\u2019d like to live. That being said, please be prepared for your dad not to get custody because of his prison record. That situation will be a consideration among all of your parents\u2019 separate circumstances that the judge will take into account. \n\nIf it doesn\u2019t go your way, try to sit down with your mom and explain to her why it\u2019s important for you to see and hang out with your dad.  I know it\u2019s an emotional issue, but accusations and raised voices (by you and them) will not accomplish your goal. If you really get shut down, just hold on because in 4 years you\u2019ll be free to do what you want. Keep your head down, get good grades, save money if you can, so you\u2019re in a good position to decide your future. If you get mad and act out, you\u2019ll just put yourself in a bad position to control your life (Ask me how I know this lol).\n\nIf you can\u2019t live with your dad, just do your best to talk to him as much as you can. Text him, game with him (if you\u2019re both into that), and it\u2019s old school but maybe even sit down and write him letters. That shows effort and trust me, you\u2019ll both treasure them years from now. \n\nTLDR If things don\u2019t go your way with custody, just do your best to put yourself in a position to move on with your life when you turn 18. Don\u2019t sabotage your chances to be in total control of your future because you want to punish your mom.", "ESH\n\nIf your father was a good parent, he wouldn't have committed a crime that lead to him going to prison.\n\nYour father was committed for a violent crime so it's understandable she didn't want his influence in your life, and it's to be expected that she didn't visit your father (she divorced him, why would she?)\n\nYou say that your mother wants him to have supervised visitations, but that she's prevented him from seeing you in the past. Does that mean your father has been showing up at your home unannounced and expecting to see you? If so, that's not acceptable unless your mother has agreed to it.\n\nWhy do you want to stay with someone who hasn't been there for you over the years, who cared so little about his family that he got himself sent to prison? \n\nYou mention he was blackmailed, and since going to prison has cut off contact with the people who did it. If he's capable of cutting them off now, he'll have been capable of doing it back then. It's as simple as that, he always had that choice but he chose a criminal lifestyle over you. Someone who cared that much about their child wouldn't allow themselves to be blackmailed into 8 years away from their child. If he truly was being blackmailed, he could've gone to the police before committing the crime. His actions suggest that he was in on it, and hoping to get a cut of the money.\n\nMy father was in and out of prison for most of my childhood, but I'm glad my mother allowed us to see him (never in prison though, she didn't want her children in that environment.) It meant I could learn firsthand how unreliable and selfish he was, because my siblings and I had all gone through a phase where we thought my mum was in the wrong. Before we knew my father properly, he seemed like a good person (he was incredibly charming) and that my mother was being spiteful. When we had the chance to see how he dealt with things, we all soon realised otherwise, and I'm forever grateful that it was my mum who raised us. \n\nI know it's not nice being told that your father doesn't care about you as much as you thought, but actions speak far louder than words. Have you spoken to a therapist, counsellor or friend about this? Someone you can discuss it with that isn't one of your parents. I don't want you to make a rash decision that you'll regret, and it seems your mother has your best interests at heart.", "If your mother didn\u2019t love you, she would let you go live with a violent criminal who has shown he will pick a chance at quick money over being an active parent in the life of his child. She is fighting to keep you safe. I won\u2019t call you an asshole because it sounds like you are being manipulated by your father and his family.", "NTA, and tell the judge when he asks that your mom asked you about what you wanted, and then punished you by grounding when you said what you wanted.  That you believe your mom will take out her anger with your dad on you whenever you have been with your dad.", "YTA. How has your mom lied? You say he was convicted for assisting in an armed robbery. You say he trusted the wrong people (aka hung around with criminals). Could that have had anything to do with her not thinking well about him? If I had an ex who hung around criminals (even if he was just too naive to understand how dangerous they were), I'd be pretty worried and not particularly exited to have my kid around that.\n\nI understand you love your dad, but your mom loves you too, and she's clearly afraid for you whether that is required anymore or not. If home life is OK, I'd really recommend asking to live one week in one house and one week in the other. You get to deepen your relationship with your dad and feel out how living with him is without cutting your mom off. Unless there are other underlying issues with your mom, I'm afraid you'll regret hurting your relationship with her after feelings have cooled down.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

He has a serious criminal charge with a good amount of prison time now. It will be difficult for him to find a job that can support himself, let alone you. You don't know how he will adjust to life outside of prison walls either. Not to say that he will hurt you, but for some people it's a really big struggle. Letting him have a private space may make that transition easier. It may be better to give him 6 months or a year to find his feet again before trying to live with him. That sets everyone up for success. And a court order would mean your mom can't legally prevent you from seeing and maintaining your relationship with your dad.", "Thanks!
