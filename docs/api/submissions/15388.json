I always wanted to be a dad but never found my other half. So I decided why wait when I have a great job, own a house and plenty of money to provide on my own. I had my daughter be carried by a surrogate and it\u2019s been the best decision of my life. It felt like my world was finally completed when I first held her in my arms. \n\nAbout four years ago when 28 and Sam was only two was when I met (24f at the time) Jane. She was a new hire in my job and was one of the most smartest women I have ever laid my eye on. At the time I wasn\u2019t looking for anyone as I just given up, but the more I talked to her at work the more I liked her, though I wasn\u2019t sure if she felt the same, but after half of a year of dancing around each other she was the one to ask me out for drinks and I gladly accepted. \n\nRight of the bat she knew about Sam as my daughters nanny would come around to surprise me at lunch with my daughter once in a while. Jane like everyone else fell in love with Sam but Sam took an extra liking to Jane. One day at a company picnic and I saw Jane play with Sam and the other kids just sealed the deal for me. \n\nA year of dating we moved in together. After two I proposed. Finally just last spring I got to call this wonderful woman my wife. Her family took to liking Sam as well as Jane\u2019s parents couldn\u2019t help but but spoil Sam when they got the chance. Jane\u2019s older brother always jumped into the chance to hang with Sam too, one night on a date night Jane and I came home to find BIL and Sam asleep on the couch both dressed in matching tutus and tiaras. I even took a picture and BIL has is framed in his home office next to his kids. \n\nEverything is just perfect and as of last month Jane found out she was Pregnant. She used this as an opportunity to bond with Sam as she would let Sam decide on little things for their sibling and seeing them has made me so happy but I couldn\u2019t help but feel guilty that my youngest will have maternity ties with Jane but Sam never would. \n\nJane and I have talked about her adopting Sam before but she is admitted that it should be Sam\u2019s choice when she is older which I did agree to at the time but now I worry that Sam would grow to recent Jane and her new siblings if we don\u2019t do it sooner rather than later and I expressed my concerns to Jane but she still sticks to her last statement saying it would be wrong if we forced this on her rather than let it be her choice which I understand but on the other hand it could still blow up in our faces. \n\nThe talk came to be a heated argument which caused Jane to leave for the night to her parents place. Later I got a text message from BIL letting me know Jane was fine but I was asshole for dumping all of this on her while she is pregnant and this could have been brought up in a better way.

Jane is right, it should be up to Sam. Your concern seems to be that Sam would be upset... but Sam seems too young to really comprehend adoption, and if she's as loved by the rest of the family as your post makes it seem, I wouldn't worry about it. And if she does become bothered by this as she gets older - well then Jane seems open to adopting her then?", "YTA \n\nYou don\u2019t get to make that decision for her and she has good reasons for waiting", "I'm a child therapist who works with domestic violence and therefore I have a lot of experience helping families navigate unique custody dilemmas. NAH. \n\nListen, if there were any indication that Jane was going to care less for Sam as her bio baby grows, I'd hear you, but it's 100% clear to me based on the info you've given that isn't the case. She and her family love Sam and it's very sweet how they've involved her in baby prep already Jane's decision to let Sam decide this for her own when she's old enough is coming from a place that I respect, and you two had come to an agreement on this before; you're not honoring that. Maybe, despite all your amazingness as a dad, you need to reflect on how impacted you might be the stigma society places on children \"out of wedlock.\" Ask yourself why it's so important that Sam gets adopted now, and why your opinion changed.\n\nAt the same time, your grief around Sam not having connections to her bio mom and your concern for her emotional state through all this transition is totally valid. You're looking out for your little girl and I would probably lean towards wanting Sam to be adopted too if I were in your shoes. So I get where you're coming from.\n\nMy advice is twofold:\n\n1) See if Jane would agree to a compromise position of letting it be Sam's choice now. Kids are smarter and more mature than we give them credit for. Sam can probably handle it. Just be prepared to back off if she doesn't react how you expect.\n\n2) Learn to argue a little more diplomatically. This is a very valid, understandable source of tension, and all couples fight sometimes. Things shouldn't get so heated that Jane needs to leave your shared home, ESPECIALLY with kids in the mix. Without being in the room I'm gonna charitably assume you both own some blame around this, but YWBTA if you're not prepared to take accountability for your own role in the fight and apologize for changing your mind on the issue. Again, it'd be one thing if you and Jane got pregnant before you could talk about this but you did have the discussion and so you need to own the fact that you're the one who's changed their mind.\n\nY'all are gonna be fine.", "You're letting your anxiety push you into forcing your choices onto your wife.\n\nIt maybe intended out of love, but YTA.\n\nDo apologise and respect her choices.", "YTA - as a donor conceived person, you should have thought of all of this 7 years ago before you brought your daughter into this world. \n\nYou are changing the rules suddenly on your wife. You had agreed it should be your daughters choice and it should.", "YTA. Sorry, but I side with your wife on everything. You chose to have your daughter, not Jane. It's great that she's on board with adoption(in general), but it should be your daughter's decision (when she's quite a bit older) to choose your wife as her legally adopted mother. As for the whole bonding issues, well, that's just how it is. I'm sure you're wife and daughter have a wonderful bond with our without adoption paperwork. You're likely overthinking it a bit and wanting the whole 'perfect' family scenario.", "She told you her conditions; yet you persisted.  YTA.", "YTA\n\nJane is not Sams biological mother.  Jane adopting Sam isn\u2019t going to change that.\n\nIf you are 32 now, with a 6 yr old, that means you were 25 when you had a surrogate.  Did you think that through?  Did you discuss this with Jane before she moved in to your house?", "YTA softly. You mean well but Jane has a more pragmatic outlook. You should never try to force such an important step on someone who is not ready. Sam is still very young and there is plenty of time for her to learn about adoption and make a choice. Sam is not going to feel different about the baby unless someone makes her feel left aside. Listen to Jane as you say she is the smartest woman you know. She has good instincts.", "YTA. You had discussed this in the past and changed your mind later. She stuck with the OG plan. \n\nI say this assuming Sam has a guardian in the event anything we\u2019re to happen to you. And I assume that person is your wife. So what does it matter if she is legally adopted.", "YTA.  You both agreed on one path for Sam's adoption and now you want to force your wife to take another, while she's carrying your 2nd child.  Now it may never happen, good work, AH.", "ESH just ask Sam.", "Saying you're the ah may be a little harsh in this situation. I think it's sweet, and I do agree with your wife about waiting until Sam is older. Don't push it, stressing a pregnant woman is not a good idea. I get both reasonings, but I see her side more.", "INFO: Sam is 6. Why can't she be asked about her feelings regarding adoption now? She apparently has a great relationship with Jane, she has no loyalties to her bio mom to complicate things, and she is old enough to understand \"forever families\" and adoption. \n\nI see your concerns regarding possible resentments, though they seem unfounded as Jane is bonding more with Sam than before, so I doubt resentments will occur more than normal if Sam is being included. But it's not okay to try and force the issue. \n\nI don't understand all the reasonings here.", "YTA", "Can Sam make that choice now.  Does she see Jane as her mum  I agree with Jane it should be sams choice \n\nI think your panicked over the what ifs. But clearly Jane and Sam are bonding and it\u2019s naturally growing \nGood luck with all the things to come and the family growing", "NAH", "YTA. This needs to be your daughter's choice. You can't force it. Even though they have a great relationship, she could actually grow up resenting that the adoption was pushed. You, Jane and Sam need to sit down and have the discussion. Maybe wait until after the baby is born as this is a very delicate situation. She doesn't need the added stress right now.", "YTA\n\nJane is absolutely right that Sam should have a say on adoption when she is older. Jane seems to be sensitive to Sam's feelings and I think that's wonderful. You and Sam are fortunate to have her.", "YTA. It'll blow up in your face if you force it now. And if your daughter says no to the adoption later on, don't force her. I've read so many posts on here about kids whose stepparents forced or tried to force adoption on them and it ruined their relationships with their parents. Jane said no, so stop harassing her.", "YTA. You changed the rules here. Your wife has respect enough for your daughter to want to wait so she can make an informed decision herself. I get your concerns, but these are YOUR concerns, your fears, but that doesn\u2019t negate the decision you came to as a couple previously. You discussed a change in that decision and she was not willing to, that needs to be the end of it. \nDouble AH points for stressing out your pregnant wife when she\u2019s doing what\u2019s best for your daughter in the long run.", "YTA\n\nAnd Jane is being more respectful to her step daughter than you are. She is a great (step)mom. Listen to her.", "Why don\u2019t you and Jane present it to your daughter and see what she has to say? How old do you want her to be when she makes the decision? ESH", "YTA for trying to pressure your pregnant wife into changing your original agreement about a huge life event.\n\nI see you come from a place of love and concern for Sam, which is great. But parents are humans and humans are not perfect. You might mean well but your execution sucks. \n\nWhy would Sam even really see a difference? Just because you're afraid your wife will treat her differently doesn't mean she will. Take some deep breaths, calm down, remember why you married your wife in the first place, put your faith and trust back in her and apologize.", "YTA.\n\nIt's impressive that Jane isn't Sam's biological mother and is still a better parent to Sam than you.\n\nYou you you you, it's all about *you*. You're not thinking about Sam at all. You're only thinking about what's easier for you, what you want, what *you* want Sam to have. You're not thinking about what Sam actually wants at all, or even what Jane wants. Jane is thinking about what Sam wants, and what is best for the relationship between her and Sam.", "Your writing is atrocious. But yeah, YTA.", "YTA absolutely. Sam doesn\u2019t know or care shit about an adoption - she already has a great relationship with Jane. Let it go. Sam will make the decision when she\u2019s older. You\u2019re the one causing resentment and stress to your pregnant wife.", "YTA - this is not your decision to make. You asked, she answered, drop it. It doesn\u2019t sound like this is affecting Jane and Sam\u2019s relationship at so don\u2019t let your feelings ruin a good thing.", "YTA Jane sounds just as amazing as advertised- she must love your daughter a lot to allow her to make that choice on her own. And if she decides not be adopted? So what? It will not make anyone love less. You're being a massive asshole not only to Jane but your daughter for forcing the issue. I expect to see you in 12 years on Reddit wondering if you were an AH when Sam goes NC on you. Leave them alone, they're both happy with the status quo", "YTA. Jane is right. It should be Sam\u2019s choice. Just because there isn\u2019t a signed piece of paper stating Jane is Sam\u2019s mom doesn\u2019t mean that Jane isn\u2019t her mom. Doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t be close or Sam will resent Jane.", "Yes YTA She told you how she felt regarding the matter not once but twice and you\u2019re still bringing it up. This is her decision and you have no right to pressure her, especially while pregnant.", "Imagine telling sam both stories when she\u2019s older, one about why Jane adopted her, and why she did not\u2026 which story do you think will make sam feel better? Do that. NTA", "YTA", "Yta", "YTA. If it's going to happen let it happen organically, like Jane wants. Stop obsessing over it and creating dissension in your family, there's no need to push for this now.", "YTA. You can\u2019t force these things, and she has a good point about Sam getting to decide", "Pregnancy is a rough time. Been there done that. Apologize and be extra patient with your wife. As long as they all continue to treat your daughter as well as her siblings she will not feel any different than if her mom adopted her at a young age. Make it a point that family is about love and you\u2019re golden. Don\u2019t let this be a bigger issue than it really is. NTA but you probably did come off as one accidentally", "ESH. You\u2019re freaking out. Apologize. Maybe talk to couples counselor. They are great to help work out these situations especially because wife is pregnant. Even if she doesn\u2019t adopt now, she needs to sign guardianship papers if anything happens to you.", "I had to make an account to respond on this post as I know for a fact that this is my husband.

I agree with Jane that as Sam grows she should make that decision herself. It will be much more special for both of them when she does.

Your wife is correct and that it is not a decision to be based on the practicalities you think are the obvious choice at the moment and as your little one is still 6 and more than likely unaware of the the legalities I think this is very important for your wife and you knew it always has been. You have now shifted the goal posts and decided that Janes reasons are no longer valid because of the new baby and don\u2019t see that it\u2019s not about her not wanting to adopt her or love her less because that\u2019s unfair and you are seeing this from a different perspective that is why she is so upset with you likewise her family. She has already decided that Jane is her daughter and she wants Jane to understand what it means and why she wants to adopt her and that Jane understand why she needs her to understand and want her permission and not just yours. You are pushing her to hard to agree with you that you don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary but your daughter isn\u2019t the only person who is involved in the adoption process and just because she\u2019s a child doesn\u2019t make her approval less valid for your wife.

It's going to feel so much more special to your daughter when you all have a special day and allow her to choose Jane.

You need to heal yourself to be the best you in your family.", ">never thought so far as other kids were added into the equation\n\nSo, no, you didn\u2019t think everything through when you had Sam.  Not saying you should regret her at all, but not thinking the future through is on you and you shouldn\u2019t guilt Jane into something to make you feel better.", "I don't think you regret Sam at all but I think you kinda regret how she was brought into this world. Seeing Jane be even more maternal now not just with Sam but also with this future baby. Seeing Jane already bonding with the unborn baby in ways Sam may or may not have had with the surrogate. Knowing that the baby will have be mom's biggest focus and have the lion's share of her attention because that's what happens with babies makes you feel like Sam missed out on something precious in having a maternal bond with someone since even before day 1.\n\nJane adopting Sam now you hope that since she'll be legally mom from here on out they have a guaranteed mother daughter bond like if it was always there. Except Sam knows Jane isn't her bio mom and wasn't in her life until later. That's something that'll always be there but that doesn't mean they can't have a familial bond of their own. Jane is right Sam should be able to decide if she feels like Jane is her mother and wants to make it official when she's old enough to understand what that means.\n\nJust talk to a lawyer about making sure Jane gets legal guardianship should the worst happens before Sam is old enough to make her decision.", "OP you didn't think everything through and for sure you don't really see it from Jane's side because if you did then you would have dropped the topic.", "Start the talk now as age appropriate as it is there will be talk to a therapist about it and just be prepared to Support you all through the process", "What evidence do you have that this is from the OP? Literally, this sounds like two non-fluent english speakers from Europe! Maybe they learned english together because of work, perhaps they had to go aboard or something! When people learn from the same source, they are going to sound the same when it comes to writing AND speaking! This is common knowledge!", "Weird you guys type in the exact same way.", "None of that now, it\u2019s late so let\u2019s talk in person in the morning.", "Is the potential that you might die without a legal plan for Sam part of what's driving this? If so, you should talk to Jane then, if she agrees, talk to a lawyer about drawing up a will that ensures Sam stays with Jane in the event of your death", "That\u2019s not really how it works with kids.   You can\u2019t \u201cinherit\u201d children like you inherit a sofa.   Although parents *can* (and *should*) make provision for their children in their will, they can\u2019t actually dictate who their child goes to.\n\nIf a living relative says they want to take the child, that will supersede a will.", "I am in therapy, have been since I could afford it. Had to be in order to have my daughter and glad I did because I never had a father figure in anyone before I met FIL. I just know of what my mother showed me when I still had her. So I had to learn how to become a father from scratch but also be a mother role in the first few years of my daughters life as I never thought I would settle down until I met Jane. I was ready for my daughter never to know what a mother\u2019s love that I couldn\u2019t provide, but some how God gave me something that I always wanted and it was a big family from my wife.", "She is the one who taught me English, so I hope I did learn a thing or two from her.", "Like I said she is REALLY smart! Hell our daughter knows more English and our native language better than I do because of my wonderful wife.", "Hey dumbass, when people attend to learn a language together, they are going to end up sounding pretty damn simular, so lay off and get a hobby because you suck at this one!", "Yes ma\u2019am", "You misunderstood me...\n\nIn our will, we have a designation for who we want to appoint as guardian(s) for our children should we both die. In our case, they are part of our extended family - but not our immediate family.\n\nYes, that means another family member could contest our choice and try to fight in court. And we can't dictate the results. But given that the guardians are the closest to our family, we expect courts ruling in favor of what's best for our child would consider our wishes and the reasons why.\n\nThe same should be true for OP.\n\nObviously an adoption provides a level of \"certainty\" that a will doesn't. And again, I'm pro adoption here. But the question wasn't should OP's wife adopt OP's daughter (I hope she does some day). It was is the OP an AH for PUSHING his wife to do so at a time/circumstance that she isn't comfortable with.  (Again, she hasn't stated she's uncomfortable with adoption - she just feels there's a right time/way to approach it - and it isn't right now.)", "No you already knew english but sucked at it and still do!!! I just helped you with your writing skills even though you can\u2019t speak it for the life of you!", "And suddenly the typing is different. Must be an odd coincidence", "Sooooo, this person is just having a conversation with themselves in the comments, got it.", "More like we both have have sleeping problems and both read Reddit when we can\u2019t sleep.", "I think this person thinking we\u2019re trying to pull something or that we are the same person. \n\nI can see why people say not to go looking for advice on here but if you do than be careful. Welp who cares what others say because I\u2019m gonna go to bed now.", "yta - listen to your BIL and tone down the intensity that's *everywhere* in your post", "YTA  Have you read any of the threads on here about kids who didn't have the choice and were just adopted by Dad's new lady?  It's a nightmare.  The difference is that those kids had Moms once and Sam hasn't had one.  \n\nAfter your baby is born and Mom has gotten back on her feet and isn't overwhelmed, revisit the issue.  Ask if you could talk to Sam together and see what she thinks.  She's 6, probably 7 by that time.  And this may be the most magical idea she's ever heard if it's presented correctly.  But forcing it on your pregnant wife was a bad idea.  I get where you're coming from and it's from a place of love and concern.  But your approach was too pushy.  \n\nGood luck.", "NHA, as this is a tough situation and it seems emotions are running high here on both sides. Yours because of your worry about your daughter and your wife because she is pregnant. So all I can say is get off of this subreddit and find professional help for your family and work it out together, though it seems you are already on the right track as I saw your exchange with your wife and I actually read them, so don't worry, I believe you guys and understand, though may I suggest that you make your own habits when you are learning English, perhaps a professional on that as well? I always encourage my students, to whom I teach English, to find outside sources so it doesn't feel like I'm reading over twenty copies of the same report. So good luck, and please don't come back on here, trust me, a lot of people on here suck.", "How much does Sam understand of this? Two is pretty young, my stepdad married my mum when I was two and I honestly wouldn't have remembered he wasn't always my dad if I hadn't been told when I was older.\n\nDoes Sam clearly understand that Jane isn't her bio mum and how she came into the world? If so then I'd ask Sam if she would like Jane to be her legal mum too and get it done when the new baby arrives or before if possible.\n\nIf it has never been discussed in front of her and Jane just blended into the family when the child was very young, and Sam has asked no questions, I'd maybe wait a little while longer and then sit down and talk about it. The fact that Jane wants to wait would suggest that she isn't sure Sam understands it all at present. Every child is different and there's no 'right' age for this kind of discussion.", "Yes. YTA. Your Jane is a fine and lovely person, and you should listen to her. She's absolutely right. \n\nGo apologise and a bit of grovelling wouldn't go astray either.", "Love this post.", "Whoever thinks this sounds like the OP, well, let me make it clear, apparently, the OP learned from his wife, so of course he is going to sound pretty darn close! I teach english to Chinese foreigners, and every single one of them will sound and write just like me because I'm the one who taught them. It takes practice to get into your own habits when it comes to language learning, hell even if I end up sounding like the person I learn Chinese and Japanese from but doesn't mean we are the same person, just taught by a simular source!", "Uf, this was embarrassing to read."]}
