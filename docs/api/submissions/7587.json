We\u2019ve been dating since May of last year and are pretty happy together excluding some relatively minor incidents around my ex girlfriend, Kelsey (28F) and my family. \n\nLauren\u2019s holiday was planned but not booked when we got together as she had previously had to cancel when she and her ex broke up, and then COVID happened so she never got around to rescheduling.  She said that the plan had been 2 weeks travelling around continental Europe with a week in England sandwiched in the middle, and asked me to book to come with her. I told her I wasn\u2019t going to do that, and she understood.  \n\nLast week, before she left, Lauren asked me once again to come with her. I refused, told her we\u2019d talked about it and that we\u2019d been on the same page, and she understood why. \n\nShe got frustrated at this point and said \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t be Kelsey!\u201d And then locked herself in the bedroom for a few hours to pack and cool off.  She came out and said that she was going to sleep at her best friends house until she left, or until I booked to come with her. \n\nI said we could talk about it when she got back and that I wasn\u2019t going to just go no contact with her for 3 weeks over something so stupid, especially whilst she was so far away and this would be the longest we\u2019d gone without seeing each other since we started dating. \n\nWhy I won\u2019t go: Kelsey and I were long distance. She was primarily based in the UK for the majority of our relationship. I have a lot of happy memories, and I would like that to remain untainted and remember them for what they are. I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to Kelsey given there are hundreds of other countries in the world for me to just turn up in her specific city. I am happy to never go to the UK again but Lauren was insistent and so I refused. \n\nLauren obviously told her parents and her friends and her mother called me to bribe and then attempt to berate me into going citing Lauren\u2019s Autism and how she might struggle on her own. I stood fast in my decision and now they are all giving me the cold shoulder.\n\nPersonally I find this matter trivial, so I\u2019m asking here, AITA?", "created_utc": 1673983468, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ekvup/aita_for_letting_my_36m_gf_31f_go_on_holiday_alone/", "score": 49, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If you werent going because of not having that flexibility at work or finances or other responsibilities, I would have said you were definitely not the AH.\n\nBut you're so caught up on your ex that you refuse to enter the entire UK over her?

She clearly isn't a priority to you.\n\nEdit - looking at your post history, I was clearly right. Still hung up on Kelsey, still texting her and using her as an emotional crutch while dating Lauren.

YTA\n\nIf this was because of financial reasons or not having leave days, fair enough... \n\nBut not to tarnish your memories with an ex-girlfriend?

It would be a massive fuck you to her to do that now, and Lauren is the kind of petty she would find a way to let Kelsey know she was there with me just for the sake of hurting her or pissing her off. \n\n>Kelsey has connections to all 4 of the cities that Lauren wants to go to and texting her to ask her not to be in a certain place when we don\u2019t talk anymore is not something I\u2019m willing to do.\n\nYTA\nYou don't want to reflect on your history of being an asshole, so you're doomed to repeat it, as you doing here.\n\nQuote is from [his comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10ekvup/aita_for_letting_my_36m_gf_31f_go_on_holiday_alone/j4rkewc?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3)", "This is somewhat confusing. So the issue here is that you do not want to go to London because your ex girlfriend lives there and you think visiting would somehow \"taint\" your memory of that relationship?\n\nI think YTA, not because you don't want to go - but because of the reason why and the fact that you told your gf that reason. \n\nIf you just said \"I can't afford it\" or \"I can't get 3 weeks off from work\" then fine, that would be understandable. But it sucks to tell your current GF that you don't want to spend time with her on vacation because it would taint the happy memories you have of your ex gf!\n\nAlso, you could have easily just said you didn't want to take 3 weeks off but would travel with her for either the first or third week.", "YTA.\n\nYou\u2019re still thinking about your ex? Bro Lauren is going to eventually get fed up with this and leave you.

Yikes. You're avoiding an entire country over an ex? Who cares if you show up? You could be staying in a hotel right down the street from her house and walk by her every morning and wave while holding your girlfriends hand and it wouldn't matter. She's your ex ffs. I mean, it's up to you and nobody can force you, which is why you had my support for most of the post, but damn dude, that's a shitty reason to not want to go.", "Are you afraid if you go to the same city, you\u2019ll search out Kelsey and confess your love for her? Your reasoning is interesting\u2026. YTA", "YTA. Not for not going on the trip - your title is misleading. But because there is so much buried storyline for WHY that amounts to 'I can't be in the same CITY as my long-distance ex because no actual reason that I actually lay out in my AITA post and my gf is obviously pissed off about something I'm not being honest about'. I mean, lots of people spend their whole lives in the same town as all their exes, good or bad.", "YTA. Sounds like you\u2019re still holding on to Kelsey.\n\nBut in case you\u2019re not: a friend of mine was in your girlfriend\u2019s position a few years ago. She begged her boyfriend to come on an euro trip with her, and he refused even though he was on vacation and could definitely afford it.\n\nShe went by herself, met up with old friends from that country.

You really shouldn\u2019t be with someone if you are still so wrapped up in your ex. And honestly, what are the actual odds of bumping into your ex when you are in the UK. It\u2019s a ridiculous excuse and you should do your gf a favor and break up with her.

Based on this and your last deleted post, you obviously still have feelings for your ex.\nLauren, Kelsey, you both deserve better", "YTA - the UK is a massive place, with a population of 67 million, unless your ex lives in a tiny village the chance of bumping in to her is nil. You are just making excuses and looking at your prior post stringing both of these women along, you need to grow up", "Info: does your ex own the British Isles somehow? Is your current gf going to a village of 100 people that happens to be the tiny village your ex lives in?", "Dude, that is lame AF. You won\u2019t go to the U.K. because you don\u2019t want to risk tainting your memories of time with Kelsey? That is weird as hell and presumably you would make even more good memories with your current girlfriend. WTF? YTA. It\u2019s completely understandable if you couldn\u2019t afford it or the time off, but it\u2019s an AH move to not go because of good memories with your ex?", "YTA obviously. \n\n\"I have a lot of happy memories there, I don't want to taint them.\" \n\nSo traveling and making new happy memories with your girlfriend would be TAINTING.

If your experiences with your ex still have such a major impact on your life, I would go as far as saying you shouldn\u2019t even be in the relationship you are now. If you went with your current gf, you wouldn\u2019t be \u201crewriting\u201d memories you\u2019d be making new ones. YTA", "I was going for N T A until I saw your reasoning. Worrying that being in a city with your current gf will taint memories you have with your previous one is laughably stupid and honestly pretty mean to your current partner.

If that's really your reasoning, YTA for sure.", "There are lots of good reasons not to go on a trip (e.g., money, insufficient PTO, dependents, pets, etc.)\n\n\"My ex lives in that country\" doesn't really sound like a good reason to me, though.\n\nGonna go with YTA.", "Sounds like you're not over kelsey and your partner knows it, YTA.", "YTA, it sounds like you're still hung up on your ex, and that you're doing all this to save face with her in case your currently girlfriend doesn't work out *( \"..The reason I didn\u2019t want to go is because Kelsey used to beg me to come and visit and I very rarely did for various reasons, some of which were just me being an asshole and refusing because I didn\u2019t want to spend the effort and time.

Wow. I hope she dumps you.", "I do hate it when people tell on their SO's to family and friends.", "The common denominator in these two (yes, two) failed relationships is your lack consideration and compromise. YTA and I think you need to get some help for these issues.", "YTA, but only for the reason that it sounds like you aren\u2019t over Kelsey.  If you are actively thinking about her and the happy memories that you had together and cannot even fathom travelling to a spot you shared those memories with your new partner, then you aren\u2019t ready for another serious relationship.", "I'm going against the grain here and say NTA. You've been together a while sure, but it's still less than a year and she had this trip planned before... Her demanding you go I don't think is really fair\n\nIs your reason for not going good? No. But I don't think you should be shamed for not wanting to when it sounds like your new gf is planning on going to the same city where you have painful memories", "Lauren when you do see this, please come back from Europe single and happy", "dude. if you\u2019re still hung up on kelsey, *let lauren go.* if not, then *let kelsey go.*\n\nYTA for refusing to go to an ***entire country*** just bc of your ex and memories. that\u2019s also not fair to lauren aka ***your current gf*** who wants to visit the country and make memories with you.", "YTA jfc why do you care so much about your ex??!! Worrying about your GIRLFRIEND hurting your EX\u2019S feelings is just absolutely bonkers. Your gf\u2019s feelings should be more important that your ex. You seem to not even like your gf at all. You\u2019re clearly still *obsessively* enamored with Kelsey. You literally obsess over how she\u2019ll feel about things and think that going ON VACATION WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND IS A BIG SLAP IN THE FACE TO YOUR EX????? I mean wtf dude do you even hear yourself. What are you even in a relationship for when at the end of the day you\u2019re Kelsey\u2019s dog?? Just dump Poot Lauren already, you\u2019re obviously in an emotional relationship with Kelsey no matter how you slice it. You talk about how Kelsey deserves more respect then being blocked (\ud83d\ude44 btw) but refuse to give your gf any respect. You don\u2019t care about her very valid feelings of unease and you continue this emotional affair while you string the poor girl along. At least respect her enough to stop putting her through all this bs, or is Kelsey the only human you believe is deserving of respect??? Your behavior is sickening and you have an extremely unhealthy obsession with her that\u2019s honestly kinda creepy. \ud83e\udd2e", "YTA - I\u2019m confused, what does you having memories with an ex have to do it with? Kelsey is an ex for a reason. I would of course happily make new memories with my CURRENT partner.", "NTA\n\nYou're not keeping her from going.

You are not her babysitter but she sound immature enough to need one.", "Look kids, Parliament, Big Ben, Kelsey's vagina.... your comment is GOLD!", "It isn\u2019t London. If it was London I was thinking of going and just staying in Paris.", "I think it means that the reason why he won't go shouldn't be the ex-gf, but I agree that it reads weird.", "Oh wow really?? Jesus", "YTA. A major one. Are you never going to anywhere ever again that you went with an ex?", "The reason I didn\u2019t want to go is because Kelsey used to beg me to come and visit and I very rarely did for various reasons, some of which were just me being an asshole and refusing because I didn\u2019t want to spend the effort and time. It would be a massive fuck you to her to do that now, and Lauren is the kind of petty she would find a way to let Kelsey know she was there with me just for the sake of hurting her or pissing her off. \n\nKelsey has connections to all 4 of the cities that Lauren wants to go to and texting her to ask her not to be in a certain place when we don\u2019t talk anymore is not something I\u2019m willing to do.", "I\u2019m not going to deny I\u2019d be tempted to see Kelsey if I was in the UK, but that isn\u2019t really relevant, and it wouldn\u2019t be sneaky if I did.

Because OP is YTA.", "What's weirder is I LIVE in the UK and most of my exes are in the same city.  Never run into them either!", "Check his post history", "what the fuck", "To be fair, its the reasoning that makes him suck. He pretty much implied that he would go if it werent the UK because he doesnt want to taint memories with his ex from the UK.\n\nAs in both implying that his memories with his ex are more important that making memories with her, all while also saying going with her would also *taint* those good memories. Sounds like he is not over his ex at all.", "No he doesn't. Move on from your ex or dont start a serious relationship with someone else.\n\nLike a lot of people have said, hes not the AH for not wanting to go. Hes the AH for not wanting to go because he's still hung up on his ex. Because if hes hung up on his ex, he shouldnt be stringing this poor girl along in the first place", "No he doesn't. Look at his post history, he's still hung up on his ex", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc80", "I'm still confused.

Cities are large and easy to avoid others in. You are showing your ex more consideration than your current gf.\n\nYou don't need to text Kesley anything. If you would see her, youre with your gf. Youre both adults. You can both just keep it moving. If it hurts Kelsey to see you there, that sucks. But her feelings arent your priority. They shouldnt be. Are you just going to be a low effort bf to every girl youre with because \"it wouldn't be fair to Kelsey\"?\n\nGo date Kelsey. Leave Lauren to find someone who actually prioritizes her.", "This is some important information.\n\nYou don't want to go because you don't want to have to do some self reflection on what an asshole you were.\n\nSorry dude, if you can't reconcile the past you future will be difficult. As they say, those that turn a blind eye to history are doomed to repeat it.", "Dude you are not going to run into her at all. If you don\u2019t want to go for any other reason that is fine. But stating that the sole reason you don\u2019t want to go is because of your ex-girlfriend is petty af as well. So what that Kelsey has connections in those cities you were going to see. You are acting like those connections will deny you trying to enter the city or make your life a living hell there. You are acting like Kelsey is the CIA and has agents looking for you.", "You literally talked a week ago dude", "So you admit you wouldn't travel to visit Kelsey because you were an asshole so your solution to your girlfriend wanting you to travel with her is to... be an asshole and refuse to travel? Lmao YTA again. Doesn't seem like you know how to learn from past mistakes.", "Is making up the past to your ex more important than showing up for your current partner?\n\nYou and Kelsey are no longer together, so the extent of the respect you need to have for her is not being outwardly disrespectful to her by for example showing up to her home or job in the country that she lives in to antagonize her, but that does not mean completely removing a country from the map because she lives there. **You are being unreasonable. And you are holding on to valuing and respecting your ex and her feelings above the feelings of your partner.**", "Just based on\u2026everything\u2026you\u2019re not that big of a catch that Kelsey is sitting at home worried about her ex showing up in her country.

Which is a massive city where you're unlikely to run into anyone you know unless you plan on running into them? Also, if you're just friends with your ex, why wouldn't you propose to meet up for a pint to catch up?

Sounds highly functional and manipulative for her mom to be using the autistic card.. I think your full of crap. And still in love with your ex and making this up. \n\nYTA.", "It seems like you care more about not upsetting your ex than you do about making your current partner happy... should be the other way around if you care about your current relationship.\n\nAlso, you didn't say what cities you would be going to, but unless they are tiny little villages, 99.9% chance that you won't run into your ex anyways, and frankly, she has probably moved on and wouldn't care much even if she did.  \n\nMaybe you just breakup with your current GF if you aren't over your ex.\n\nYTA", "Is that why Lauren wants to go to those cities, to piss of your ex?", "That's extremely relevant. You got busted a week ago talking to her behind your girlfriends back", "Wow. You're such a huge asshole. I hope Lauren finds this post and sees how little you care for her.", "Not over Kelsey?", "what i need to ask is if you\u2019d be tempted to see kelsey, would you also be tempted to sleep with her? even if lauren did know you were meeting up with her, it\u2019s still weird you\u2019d feel tempted to interrupt your trip with your girlfriend for an ex. you\u2019re clearly not over kelsey so do your girlfriend a favor and find a new place to live and let lauren find someone who\u2019s not going to veto an entire trip to a country.", "INFO: Why are you okay with dragging Lauren along when you cannot move past your ex? Why are you okay being this kind of person? \n\nYou are *that* guy who can't see past himself. Not over his ex but doesnt want to be alone so he invades someone else's life under false pretenses that he is ready. Your care for Kelsey shouldn't be a burden to Lauren.", "All three of you are entirely too old to have this level of relationship chaos, but you especially should be more mature than this. You\u2019re 36 and still stringing one woman along, overlapping relationships, and treating both women poorly.

Your reason to skip the trip is absurd.", "Same!\n\nETA: YTA", "No no, his asshole girlfriend will make sure Kelsey knows they're there. /s(about the girlfriend being an asshole)", "Ha! Actually yes, he is!\n\nMy friend had been dating for 5 years and the guy kept leading her on. He assured her they\u2019d be together forever, but didn\u2019t want to take additional steps.

And married in 6 months. This was a few years ago. Her career took off, he relocated to be with her without hesitation, and also got a good job here.\n\nLast I heard from the ex: his mom gets in touch with my friend from time to time. Still single. Still regretting not committing to my friend.", "Damn you got lucky, I went back to visit in a big city and freaking ran into my ex there haha", "good looking out, reread it while I was at it lol", "I agree. But he has the right to decide he doesn't want to go", "He's not. He called her last week.", "One of them is, yes. I tried asking Lauren if she would just not to go to that specific place and she flat out refused so then the whole of the UK was a no for me.", "So yeah, totally hung up on his ex, to the point he can't even go to her city anymore.

Wanted to see if he'd answer the question", "YTA -Read that back to us and try to understand how ridiculous you sound. \n\nWhy are you stringing poor Lauren around when you clearly are still in love with poor widdle Kelsey who you cannot step foot in the same country as out of respect for her.  That\u2019s literally what you\u2019re saying.", "How small and why does she want to go there? \n\nWhy does your memory of Kelsey get to dictate that you won't go to England, Wales, Northern Ireland, or Scotland? You're surely not going to run into her outside of this very specific small town. WTF?", "How long is she spending in this very very small town she\u2019s insisting on going to? Is it a touristy area?", "Would be true if that were the case, but he isn't hung up on her, just on himself.  It's a problem because he would look like a huge asshole to his ex, not because it would hurt his ex.", "That's a good point. Maybe he is more worried about his image in this case. Who knows, either way the dudes a dumbass and doesn't deserve either of them imo", "Solidly agree on that point!"]}
