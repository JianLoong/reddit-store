I thought that they would look so lovely in our nursery, and they are up on a shelf away from any baby hands.\n\nRecently, my friend (F28) was over with her son (M7), and she asked to see the progress on the nursery. She was specifically looking at the little book display we have, and saw the bunny bookends. Obviously, being cast iron, they are very heavy but somehow in reaching for them, she knocked one off the shelf. Unfortunately, her son was underfoot and the bunny ended up breaking two of his toes as it landed. Her son was obviously in a lot of pain, and my friend very quickly bundled him up and took him to the hospital, but she has since texted me saying that I am responsible for any and all medical costs as I chose to have dangerous items in the house and did not properly childproof.\n\nI am obviously quite sorry that this happened, but I told her that she was the one who knocked the bunny off the shelf, and I couldn't have childproofed against an adult dropping something. I said that I feel terrible about all of this, but this is not my fault at the end of the day.\n\nMy husband agrees with me, but my friend's husband (M29) has texted me saying that I am \\[a very unkind word\\] for hurting their son and choosing not to take responsibility. He also threatened to call the police, but I told him that I was no where near the bunnies or their son, so I did not do anything wrong. He said my inability to childproof my home is reckless endangerment and they cannot afford the medical bills.\n\nI am so topsy turvy right now, and I feel like the AH for allowing my friend's son to be hurt like this, but I don't know if I am even the right person to blame. Was I the AH for not childproofing my nursery and by extension, hurting a child?\n\nAs an aside, the bookends have been returned. I don't want anything else to go wrong.", "created_utc": 1693121803, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/162jvz1/aita_for_not_child_proofing_my_home/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She literally dropped it on her own child and is blaming you. That\u2019s beyond bonkers. Do not feel bad. At all. It\u2019s not on you to child proof for someone else. I\u2019d never expect that and I\u2019m always on my kids if we are visiting somewhere. \n\nCongrats on your first!!! You\u2019ll quickly learn you can never 100% childproof. Accidents happen. And even if you tried to childproof everything, they have a habit of finding weird shit to get into anyway.", "NTA: they're trying to extort you for the medical bills. Don't contact them anymore except through a lawyer, in case the sue.", "NTA. If anyone hurt the kid it was his own mom. The room was childproof as the bunnies were out off reach from the child. The room was just not clumsy adult proof. \n\nI don't know how big the medical bills are as we have free healthcare for kids here. I feel like this was an accident and if they were nice about it I would help out a little just because it happened in my home but they are not being very nice.", "NTA - childproofing is making sure that children can\u2019t injure themselves in a space. Putting heavy items out of reach counts as childproofing. Childproofing doesn\u2019t include magically preventing clumsy mothers from dropping cast iron on their child\u2019s foot.", "NTA - nor is it negligence.  An adult clumsily dropped a heavy item on her own kid\u2019s foot.  Tell them if they feel differently, to get a lawyer and sue your homeowner\u2019s insurance\u2026 because if anyone, that\u2019s who would pay for a personal injury on your property.", "NTA, this was obviously her fault and they\u2019re probably just blaming you because they don\u2019t want to pay, and/or they\u2019re delusional.", "NTA, cut off all contact.", "NTA. Accidents happen. You can child proof all you want and accidents can still happen. There was nothing intentional on your part. She was clumsy, it happens. She\u2019s is projecting her guilt on to you instead of accepting responsibility.", "NTA. Your problem isn't that the nursery wasn't childproof, your clumsy adult \"friend\" knocked it off the shelf. Childproofing doesn't mean \"don't have any objects in your house.\" *You* didn't hurt their son. Never talk to these people again, and if they do call the police (which, let's be real, they won't), contact a lawyer.", "NTA. She hurt her son, not you. You have no obligation to child-proof your home for another person's kid, and the kid didn't reach the bunny, mother did", "NTA. But would suggest you seek legal advice. If they can\u2019t afford the medical bills, it sounds like they\u2019re looking for someone else to blame so they can get them to pay the bills.", "NTAH  They can not press charges or force you to pay their medical bills. You did not touch your \"friend's\" child or the object he was hurt with. Breaking bones is severe, but this reaction is ridiculous if the situation is clearly an accident. I feel bad because you just completely lost this person as your friend.", "NTA. The mothers actions caused the accident.  If you are in the US,  you may still be on the hook  for medical bills because the accident happened in the home.  If they get a lawyer, you can involve your home owners insurance.", "NTA - your friend is upset because of the money, but you are not responsible for her injuring her own child, even if it was in your home. If you have the money, it would be nice to split the costs, but not required.", "As you said, you cannot child proof your house against adults dropping things. Had your friend splashed her child with hot water while tea that wouldn't be your fault either. There was no reason for her to assume that the bookends would be secret plushy toys.\n\nI don't think your friend or her husband genuinely believes it's your fault, they're just in shock at both the injury to their child and the unexpected medical expenses. I'm guessing you live somewhere where unexpected medical expenses can cause a lot more stress than they do in places with socialised healthcare.\n\nI'm sorry you had to return the bookends, I hope you are able to repair things with your friends..NAH", "Keep in mind, people overreact when kids are hurt. You need to also step back for a moment. They may be thinking homeowners insurance covers this. \n\nThis was an accident. Unforeseen. Simple. Yes, you are sorry their kid got hurt. That much is true. However, make sure you do not text stuff like that as they could now potentially use that if they are going to try to get you to pay anything.   \n\nI\u2019d recommend either waiting to see what they do, or talk to a lawyer. Be careful with your words over text and phone as they could be recording you and depending on your state only one parties consent is needed.", "NTA  Report it to your homeowner's insurance carrier and let them deal with it.\n\nI can tell you from experience, there isn't a lot that can be done for broken toes.  The hospital or their doctor may have taken a couple of x-rays, perhaps taped the toes and advised some children's Tylenol.  It's not like the kid had major surgery.", "NTA - but also you need to speak to a lawyer. It was probably a mistake to return the objects at the center of what may become a lawsuit.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You didn't say how this woman managed to knock the bookend off the shelf.\n\nWas she semaphoring? And why did she have to touch the bookend at all? Why do people have to touch things that aren't theirs? Couldn't she just have admired them from afar?\n\nShe's the one who did this, not you. It was a good idea to send the bookends back, truly, but meanwhile who asked her to go feeling up the furniture in the first place? And she grabbed the iron with her kid right there, which makes her extremely culpable.", "NTA. sorry to your friend\u2019s kid but this is quite frankly insane. are you responsible if your friend drops a knife or a heavy pan or scissors or any of the many potentially dangerous everyday household objects that every person owns that are safe for adults but not kids? no, your friend is responsible for picking up something and dropping it. if it were within reach of the child that would be different, but this is all on your friend.\n\nthat being said, in practice people do tend to blame property owners for things that happen on their property\u2014a) if you have homeowners/etc insurance, that might cover something like this and you could look into that, though whether or not you want to have a claim on your file is another thing for you to decide. but before you go anywhere with that b) you may want to actually talk to a lawyer to see what\u2019s best, especially if you think your friend will take legal action. \u201cfriends\u201d or not, if they\u2019re desperate for money you never know how far they\u2019ll go. good luck to you OP", "NTA. It's normal to feel guilty over it, since no sane person wants to see small children hurt, especially not in a simple accident.\n\nAt best your friend is just panicking over their child being hurt and how to pay for it, at worst they're going to turn into malicious liars and come after you for some kind of payment. Be careful what you say to them, if anything, just to avoid giving them fodder for any kind of bogus case.", "Sounds like your friend is running a game. NTA", "NTA I have an 8 year old and 8 month old but my house is full of stuff that could be dangerous to them. Not just ornaments but things like tools, a vacuum cleaner, cleaning products and a hot oven :o\nThat is entirely what high shelves, cupboards and safety gates are for. The thing is accidents happen.", "NTA. She\u2019s a dumbass holy. It was her stupidity that hurt her son, not you. I would honestly drop and block these people.", "NTA. They are just trying to get money from you. They don't have a case. Should supermarkets stop selling heavy canned goods in case a parent drops one on their kid?", "NTA as it was her who couldn't handle something properly and as a result hurt her child but I hope it's eye opening to you and you childproof your child's room better. Everybody make mistakes, it could be you and your child. It broke 2 toes of a 7 year old, it could harm a 10 month old even more. Just be careful. I remembered how a 3 year old died because the TV fell on her... that's a much more serious situation but yeah, be cautious.", "Unless your friend is a child, that room was child proof.\n\nYour friend is redirecting her guilt to you because she hurt her child by being careless when she knocked something from a shelf. \n\nNTA", "NTA- You are not responsible for your friend dropping the bookend. It sounds like her and her husband can\u2019t afford the medical bills and are trying to extort money from you. Calling the police was obviously an empty threat since it\u2019s not your fault.", "That's on them.\n\nNTA", "NTA. I get everyone feels bad but..it\u2019s an accident. It\u2019s normal to have a nursery set up for aesthetics and not a baby, toddler or older child. \n\nTo add one time when my daughter was like 11m old old I left an unopened can of Pepsi on the table thinking it was no big deal. She grabbed it while I wasn\u2019t looking and dropped it on her foot and I felt like such an asshole. She ended up temporarily losing her toe nail. It grew back and we are all ok. \n\nMy son also tore his toe nail off at school when he was 6. No one\u2019s fault he just wasn\u2019t paying attention. \n\nI dropped a knife on my foot before because someone startled me. I needed crutches for weeks. \n\nMistakes happen and so do accidents. This is not a Police worthy matter. Keep those cute bunnies out of reach of small hands in the future! And tell your friend that lots more accidents are bound to happen. Learn to roll with the punches. Not someone I think I would wanna be friends with.", "Why should you childproof your apartment when your child is not even born?! Should all people in the world child proof their homes to accomodate other people kids?! \nIts not your fault, you were not the one who dropped it. The mom did it and the mom should be the one looking up to her son who was at a strangers house. \nIf they cant afford the medical bills, sucks for them. Its their son, it was the mothers fault, its their problem to deal with. And cut contact with this people.\n\nNTA", "NTA, not your fault. I am in the UA, I think my home insurance covers this.", "NTA\n\nIf the bookends were out of the reach of a child then you *did* childproof your home.\n\nWhat you cannot do is remove every item of risk from adult reach as well - or do they expect you to remove every knife from your kitchen just in case an adult is clumsy enough to knock one off of the countertop as they prepare food?", "NTA at all. First off all, it was definitely mommas fault. Secondly, accidents happen. There is no way to completely baby proof a home. Kids will find a way. Can't have anything anywhere ever. I understand feeling bad, but those bills are not your responsibility.", "Exactly this. It could just have easily been a money box or book. Believe me, I easily broke a toe dropping on of those noisy books on my middle one. \n\nOP she is responsible, no one else.  No amount of childproofing stops all accidents. You are not responsible, she is. Either she's spun a rubbish story with lies or the husband is a grabby entitled person like his wife.", "OP can involve her HO insurance regardless.", "I doubt they would have even taped the toes, mine weren't as it causes healing issues. The only extra expense toes wise may have been if the big one or baby one broke, a boot may be needed as they do affect balance. But again, they are just as likely to be left to heal alone especially in kids.\n\nCast iron dropped from a height though, may have been crushed not just broken. Poor kid. His mum's fault though, 100%."]}
