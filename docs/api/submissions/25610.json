She was specifically looking at the little book display we have, and saw the bunny bookends. Obviously, being cast iron, they are very heavy but somehow in reaching for them, she knocked one off the shelf. Unfortunately, her son was underfoot and the bunny ended up breaking two of his toes as it landed. Her son was obviously in a lot of pain, and my friend very quickly bundled him up and took him to the hospital, but she has since texted me saying that I am responsible for any and all medical costs as I chose to have dangerous items in the house and did not properly childproof.\n\nI am obviously quite sorry that this happened, but I told her that she was the one who knocked the bunny off the shelf, and I couldn't have childproofed against an adult dropping something. I said that I feel terrible about all of this, but this is not my fault at the end of the day.\n\nMy husband agrees with me, but my friend's husband (M29) has texted me saying that I am \\[a very unkind word\\] for hurting their son and choosing not to take responsibility. He also threatened to call the police, but I told him that I was no where near the bunnies or their son, so I did not do anything wrong. He said my inability to childproof my home is reckless endangerment and they cannot afford the medical bills.\n\nI am so topsy turvy right now, and I feel like the AH for allowing my friend's son to be hurt like this, but I don't know if I am even the right person to blame.

First and foremost, this friendship is probably over. Your adult friend dropped a heavy object that was placed high up out of her child's reach on her child, broke two of his toes, and blamed you. Take some time and write down your personal account of what happened. Hopefully, you have some pictures of the room and the bookends. Stop communicating with them. Save all communication. All this is to prepare for a lawsuit. They will sue you against your homeowner insurance. All the record keeping is to show that you did your due diligence to prove that this accident was not due to your neglect. \n\nSince your friend went nuclear so quickly, make sure you keep copies of all this in case of a CPS investigation. Don't worry too much, but they might be forced to look into an accusation from the friend if she calls. Her son will have medical records about the injury, it's best to be prepared.\n\nEventhough, you've done nothing wrong, you could try to pay the medical bills to salvage the friendship. I don't suggest this though. This family is wildly inappropriate in attacking you. This mom could have taken responsibility for the accident, got her son taken care of, and informed you they'll need to sue your homeowner's insurance over the medical bills they can't afford. That's what it's there for. Accidents happen. This friend doesn't value the friendship if she's willing to blame another for her clumsy grasp.\n\nAnd really?
