{"id": 24238, "submission_id": "15mb8ih", "title": "AITA for telling my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 that we don\u2019t owe her a family?", "selftext": "My (F25) (step)brother Nico (29) has recently got engaged to a woman called Jenny after dating for two years. We all tried to welcome Jenny, especially knowing that she grew up in the foster care system and didn\u2019t have family. We tried to get to know her, but she seemed to want an instant intimate connection rather than building one. Me and my younger (step) sister Chelsea (22) bore the brunt of her neediness but our parents have also expressed concerns. \n\nSince she met us she has been trying to insert herself into pictures, family disputes, and social events. She has no boundaries. We\u2019ve all talked to Nico about it so many times, even sitting him down as a family and he keeps saying he will talk to her but nothing changes, and it\u2019s got worse since the engagement. She tried to make me her Maid of Honour, demanded my mother throw her a bridal shower, started calling my parents Mom and Dad even though they asked her not to, and reached out to distant family members that we don\u2019t even talk to to tell them about the engagement. \n\nLast week we were all (Chelsea, Nico, me, and our partners) staying at our parents\u2019 place. Jenny, Nico, and my bf were the only ones not up yet and the rest of us were in the kitchen. Chelsea, my mum, and I were talking about taking a weekend trip. Jenny came in, having overheard us, saying it sounded like fun and proceeded to invite herself along. I was pretty annoyed by this and said she couldn\u2019t just invite herself. Jenny said why wouldn\u2019t she be invited, and I said because marrying Nico doesn\u2019t give you a blanket invite to every single thing all his family does. Jenny got upset and said she would really like to be included in our family, since it was the only one she knows and she doesn\u2019t have a proper family. I said I know that and we all sympathise but that doesn\u2019t mean we owe you a new one. \n\nThe whole room was silent and Jenny got up and went back upstairs. She didn\u2019t come out the rest of the day but Nico came down to chew me out over what I said. Our parents defended me saying he had an opportunity to talk to Jenny and he didn\u2019t. He and Jenny left the same day and he\u2019s now only keeping low level contact with everyone.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve spoken to him since he\u2019s just said I went way too low with what I said to Jenny and that I\u2019ve set her back mentally and that she\u2019s really down. I do feel bad, but I also feel like Jenny has been overstepping. We are all open to a relationship with her (we all have good relationships with partners in the family) but she never really made a genuine effort to build relationships with us, she just decided she was entitled to them, which I think isn\u2019t fair. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should reach out to Nico or Jenny with a more fervent apology, which I will if I have really screwed up here. I don\u2019t want to be the reason Nico stops talking to us. I just feel like he dropped the ball by letting it get to this point.\n\nEdit - okay I\u2019m adding this because I thought it was implied but maybe not. We do push back when Jenny is being intrusive. I can\u2019t count how many times I have said \u201cJenny I\u2019m not comfortable talking about my sex life/therapy/medication etc., it\u2019s really personal, can we just change the subject\u201d. We move on from the conversation but the next time I talk to her it\u2019s back to square one. Same with my parents, they politely ask her not to call them mom and dad, and she stops for the duration of that conversation, and then starts again next time. We\u2019ve never had a more in depth conversation with her, we offered, and Nico said no, he would talk to her.", "created_utc": 1691576313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mb8ih/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_that_we_dont/", "score": 162, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wants everyone to say nothing. NTA.", "NAH. I can not blame you for snapping and I can not blame Jenny for wanting a close family. Growing up in the way she did can result in an intense longing for connection and safety and a lack of proper communication skills. \n\nShe shouldn't insert herself in everyones business like that, but she also seems to not understand why. I hope she and your brother can work through that together. \n\nOn the other hand, I completely understand that it feels very invasive if someone does this to you, even if you understand where they are coming from. The way you said it was a bit harsh, but I assume tension has been building up over time. \n\nI do think its good to talk it out with her oncr all the emotions have settled and I hope your brother can facilitate the process. She needs to learn the nuance of being welcome, but not overstepping boundaries and it not being a sign of people not caring about you.", "I guess the AH here is Nico. He didnt tell her wife that making family relationship doesnt work that way. Jenny didnt know and only do what she can to feel having family. I feel her. But maybe if you have more compassion tell her that family didnt work that way.", "Well, Jenny was just going to keep pushing until *someone* pushed back, so this moment was more-or-less inevitable. You named the elephant in the room: Jenny's neediness, which your whole family had noticed.\n\nI don't know whether Nico failed to talk to her in private, or whether he did and she failed to heed his warnings. I also don't know if getting to join what she perceived as a close-knit family is a large part of what makes Nico attractive to her.\n\nBut I do know that your comment stung deeply, and Jenny won't stop feeling it for a *long* time.\n\nIt's not impossible that this precipitates a break-up between Nico and Jenny, and if it does, it is highly likely that the blame is going to come your way, so an apology is in your strategic interest, regardless of whether your comment was justified, or not.\n\nI think my final vote is going to be ESH; Jenny for being pushy, Nico for not warning her that her pushing wasn't going unnoticed, and you for saying something really wounding.", "I had to double check how long they were dating for since I expected this to be a quick courtship.\n\nNTA. I sympathize with her but your brother has had his chances to talk to her and either he's not actually talking to her or it isn't actually sinking in.\n\nI do feel a bit sorry for her with her wanting you to be MoH. It must be awkward not to have a strong friend/family base who can help out with things especially since she wants it so bad but it has to happen organically.. it can't be forced or fast tracked unless there is mutual trauma that affects both you and her.", "How would you have wanted her to build a relationship? It sounds like she was trying", "As an only child, I can relate to Jenny. I don\u2019t try to insert myself into my wife\u2019s family like Jenny is, but I really can understand where she\u2019s coming from. Some families are more in line with what she imagined. My mother in law acts like she\u2019s my mom, and I doubt I know her much better than Jenny knows yours. I\u2019ve had girlfriends in the past (not a spouse, just a girlfriend) who\u2019s siblings or cousins fully embraced me as part of the family, pretty much the reverse of what Jenny is doing.\n\nNTA because you guys are allowed to live your own way. But maybe cut her some slack. If she\u2019s acting like one of the family, just roll with it. Unless there are some other problems you haven\u2019t mentioned, there\u2019s no harm in humoring her most of the time, especially if it leads to a deeper connection.", "NTA", "NTA your brother should have had a talk with her long ago about overstepping. Much like when step parents come into a situation, you can't force a relationship. She needs to take time to actually establish relationships instead of trying to force her way in.\n\nI sympathize with her situation but that doesn't give her the right to suddenly shoehorn her way into your family. If she had taken it slowly or if your brother had given her the guidance of taking it slowly she could have worked her way into a closer bonds but now I doubt it will ever be what she wanted it to be.", "NTA- it\u2019s like that saying \u201cyou have to earn respect before you get respect\u201d\n\nShe did none of that", "NTA-its your family and she needs to respect that! It is a harsh situation but she needs to take responsibility of her own life.", "If she\u2019s engaged to him why would she need to \u201cinsert herself\u201d into family pictures, isn\u2019t she just part of the family? When she tried to make you her maid of honor does that mean she asked you? There\u2019s some stuff here that has some subtext of you all just being mean. Did your family not like that he was dating someone \u201cwithout a family\u201d?", "Ok, the fact that you finally snapped, and NOBODY: Your sister, your mother, your father, said anything, in fact they supported you, speaks volumes. Jenny was really pushing it, and your reaction (concluded by everyone elses reaction) was in no way, shape, or form out of line.\n\nNTA.", "NTA, I feel sorry for the girl but sounds like she needs to learn social skills and boundaries. I can't imagine what she went through, but that is what counseling is for, not your in laws. You can't expect people to just act how you want them to act.", "You know, harsh as it was, the OP might have done Nico a favour. It is starting to sound like Jenny was more interested in marrying into a family than she is in marrying her fiance, and getting that into the open may cause a rethink.", "INFO: How is the relationship between stepbro and his stepparent? It's weird that you don't want to include someone in a photo unless your family is going to a studio to take one, it's also weird that ur family has disputes near someone that it isn't close to u all, it's also weird that u guys keep talking about events near someone u don't wanna invite, It's weird that u are upset that she reached out to people in ur family to announce her engagement, it's her engagement not urs, this just sound like 'how dare her, talk to someone we didn't allow'. Ur stepbro is engaged to this woman if you all don't like her it's understandable that he goes LC. what did u expect that he would come see u all and leave her alone? NTA.", "NAH, maybe the lightest of Y-T-As. You weren't wrong, but you could have been gentler. \n\nThe real issue is that it's obvious that Jenny doesn't KNOW how to build a relationship gradually -- this is very much an effect of growing up in foster care. I mean, it was true of me and I didn't even grow up in foster care, I just grew up in a weird crappy family environment. Doing this kind of thing gradually is a skill that a person has to learn, and no one taught her. That's not her fault. I think it might benefit everyone here if you don't think of her as entitled, but instead as naive. The good news is that naivete is much easier to fix than entitlement! It's a skill she hasn't learned and people learn new skills all the time. Has anyone considered actually talking to her or trying to teach her instead of putting it all on Nico?\n\nI'm not saying it's necessarily your *responsibility* to teach her, but when it comes to family, as long as we're not talking about abuse it's generally better not to die on the hill of whose responsibility it is to fix something and just get to fixing it.", "NTA\n\n She sounds exhausting to be around honestly. I'm surprised no one snapped before now", "Query: has no one spoken directly to Jenny about this? Why leave it to Nico?", "NTA- your brother had the chance to talk to her and tell her she\u2019s being to much , but he didn\u2019t\u2026 why should you and the rest of your family be left feeling uncomfortable", "NTA. When you enter a family you wear your dancing shoes, to learn to dance to their tunes while teaching them yours and see if you can harmonize. \n\nWhat Jenny did was show up in armored clocks and proceeded to stamp on every single toe that was unfortunate enough to be near her, never thinking of the fact that nobody else knew her dances nor where they wearing armored shoes.", "while i can understand your feelings i have to say YTA.\n\nThis is a woman who has never lived a normal family life. she doesn't understand how to have and make family connections like you or i might. she has spent her whole life craving a family and her last chance (beside making her own) was joining into whoever she marries family.\n\ni could understand if she had any sort of ill intentions- but i think she means well and is just having a hard time at it. and unfortunately like it or not- once they marry she is technically family either way. she must have seen how you are with other partners and thought she can do the same.\n\ndo anyone elses partners call your parents mom and dad? to me this is a completely normal thing. my mother calls her husbands mother \"mom\". Many people practice that and i cant see how its that big of a deal if it makes this woman feel apart of the family. Im not sure by this story that you've all made her as included as you say you have.\n\nIf i have to be honest, it sounds like your STEP brother is already a black sheep of some sort and no one really cares for jenny and she can feel it. i think your comment towards her was completely inappropriate. \n\nif you want them both as apart of your family, it many be time for everyone to accept that she is family. that means shes included in photos, disputes, trips, etc. theres 100 million ways you could've handled this differently.\n\nFor example- when she tried to invite herself on the trip you could of said \"Jenny- we would love to go on a trip with you but we have planned this as a mom and daughter trip. Lets plan a trip together for all of us to go on afterwards (including any other female spouses) \n\nhave you thought maybe she's trying to force herself in somewhere she doesnt feel welcome because she is desperate to be liked and accepted into a family? i think you all need to have more compassion", "She sounds like someone with a few mental problems. Good luck to your family.", "YTA. You lost me at \"She tried to make me her Maid of Honour\". Your future sister-in-law asked you to be her Maid of Honor, and not only were you honored but you declined, and not only did you decline you are actually blaming her for asking. I really feel sorry for Jenny. After all those years in foster care she ended up with your unwelcoming family. Had she married into my family or any of my friend's she'd be included and we'd be happy to have her.", "ESH \nShe seems to be so entrenched with the idea of having a family that she skipped a couple of steps and is now crossing boundaries.\n\nYou could've said it better. You do not owe her a family - she has now gone low contact and hopefully she stays that way. She is your brother's fiancee and hopefully when she goes low contact it stays that way along with her future kids.\n\n\nThere's nothing worse than staying where she is not wanted which is what your message is. - We don't owe you a family.", "I\u2019m sorry, but I have to say YTA. I get your frustration with with how she pushed herself in to everything, but she doesn\u2019t know better, because she doesn\u2019t have family so she can know the proper boundaries. That isn\u2019t her fault and now you\u2019re making her feel unwelcome because of it. You could have said, \u201chey, this is only a trip for just us, next time maybe?\u201dThere\u2019s ways to handle this and you chose to hurt her. YTA.", "YTA, you know she's never had family and most likely has no idea how to interact with one. All she knows is what media and social influence portrays families to be. \n\nTo sit and berate a person for wanting to be close to the family they're marrying into is just assinine. \n\nI imagine you owe her an apology and explanation on where you're coming from. And maybe as her FSIL you could help her meld with your family rather than just be the back end of humanity.", "NTA - Jenny is sympathetic and needs a therapist, but Nico is an AH for not cutting this off beforehand.\n\nI have no problem being direct with pushy people who don't understand when someone is trying to be subtle. You weren't even unkind.", "YTA  All of you.  She probably has no clue how to do this family stuff.   Her fiance and all of you let her go on thinking she was ok. Thinking she had a family.  None of you tried slowing her down.   None of you gave her any sort of idea she was wrong.", "YTA you know she comes from foster care. You say you have empathy for her but you don't. You just decided long ago that because she was persistent on having a relationship you wouldn't let her have one. Shame on you!", "Major YTA", "OP you are unkind. It is normal for people to want to be included. Inviting you to participate in the wedding is an  honour not an insult. Of course you are not obliged to be in it or have her on trips. But it sounds like you enjoy being nasty and ganging up her for the audacity to want to belong to your family.\n\nNot to worry. I think she might have caught on. I suspect that you won't be seeing a lot of your brother or his family in the future. That's your loss not hers. YTA.", "YTA\n\nNothing you\u2019ve listed seems unreasonable of her.  It all is normal things that a new person coming into a family would do.\n\nYou\u2019ve had two years to get used to the fact that she is part of the family.", "It's tough, but imo YTA, you could have used more tact.  I see where she is coming from, it's like giving a kid candy for the first time, they want it so badly.", "YTA. \n\nYou complained about her trying to build a relationship with you in her way, then said she never made a \"genuine effort to build relationships\" with you all. \n\nShe even asked her future SIL to be her maid of honour and you react like it's weird. You know she doesn't have a relationship with her biological family! Of course she asked you! \n\nAnd to tell her that even after she marries your brother, she won't actually be family (at least I'll bet that's what she heard, and how I read it), is incredibly low. Your brother is right to go low contact until you ALL apologize for how you've treated the person he loves. \n\nSuck it up, apologize, and actually give Jenny a chance.", "YTA.\n\nGrowing up in the foster care system may be the least of her problems.... why was she there in the first place?  \n\nIt's miserly of you to come from a place of such wealth (I mean emotional wealth,  knowing you are loved, have a place, surrounded by family) and yet be so lacking in empathy or compassion for this girl who's had none of that.  She hasn't 'decided she's entitled' to your family.... what a Scrooge thing to say.  She just desperately wants to fit in and ....gasp...even feel a little of the love you obviously show each other.\n\nOf course she hasn't learned your family's boundaries.  Of course she's over the moon about maybe having a family for once.  Of course she's overstepping trying to learn how to love and be loved.\n   \nAnd thinking that you can talk to your brother...who will then talk to his fiance... and this will be enough to 'fix' her.  The lot of you sound like you've no emotional intelligence,  except your brother. \n\nYou *have* seriously screwed up, and your excuses are painful to hear.  Since you think it'll work towards your brother's fiance... let's see if this approach works for you.  I'll simply tell you what to feel and do and you will yeh?.... be curious about this girl, put aside yourself while you listen to her and wonder how you could've coped with what she's been through.   Gently show her where there are times she isn't included and ensure you include her wherever possible *as a member of your family*.  Love your brother enough to respect his choices and not set him up to be the go-between.   Look for the good in everyone.   Oh...and stop and be truly grateful for what you've had and what you've got.", "YTA. And your brother will probably end up going no contact with you after a while if you don't accept her as family now. Sure she has boundary issues but as a family, you should be gentler in your responses than being as stone cold as you are. You feel she's acting entitled. Fair enough. But at this point, she's going to married to your brother and will be officially family. You might as well act like it now. Instead of waiting for a piece of paper. That's your problem.\n\nAnother problem, I think you guys just don't like her and trying to give rather benign reasons for it. Which is sad. Your brother probably suspects it and will probably further pull contact with you. How sad you can't open your hearts up to her, whether or not she had a bad background. It doesn't matter. Your brother loves her and you guys should be making an effort while also reinforcing boundaries:\n\n\"Sweetie, I appreciate the thought but please call me ____ and not mom\"\n\n\"Jenny, I'm uncomfortable talking about my sex life with anyone, that's just a me thing\".\n\nEtc etc.", "YTA\n\n>Since she met us she has been trying to insert herself into pictures,\n\nHow weird.

Almost everything she's doing is perfectly normal, and while a few things are overstepping boundaries, you could gently push back instead of blowing up and rejecting her.", "I will say ESH. It sounds like she is not reading the situation correctly and being overly friendly, but that is not a reason to be mean. Nothing you are listing here is so over the top that it warrants a reaction like yours. Lots of people refer to their in laws as mother and father, and asking the grooms sister to be in the wedding, even a maid of honor, is quite nice. Also, if she has no family to do it, throwing her a bridal shower would actually be a nice thing to do. \n\nWhat it sounds like is she is being genuinely friendly and nice, and you are rebuffing her attempts and talking behind her back about her \"flaws\" often till they become a bigger deal to you guys than it actually is.", "NAH, except maybe your brother. He failed his fianc\u00e9e by not telling her to slow things down and to watch people boundaries. I mean reaching out to family you barely talk about is to fucking much. You could try talking to her but I wouldn\u2019t frame it as an apology more as you don\u2019t want this fight to ruin your relationship because you still value her. Tell her that family doesn\u2019t do everything together and to slow things down a bit.", "ESH-  \n\nShe is overstepping and there is a lack of self-awareness, there is no need for her to involve herself in family disputes and Inviting yourself to events is not polite. \n\nYour brother ignored the concerns when brought to him\n\nYou yourself have put expectations on how she should get close to you without communicating that to her. She will be a part of your family whether you like it or not. You can not gatekeep the access here. \n\nFacing facts- \n\nAs she doesnt have family, she probably isn't aware that she has to make 'friends' first or build that relationship. OR she got excited by the idea of an instant family and didnt reality check herself. Don't blame her for her lack of understanding or her excitement. The only thing you can do is communicate with her directly. She might have thought by going to all family events she was making that effort.  The way it came out in front of everyone, would be embarrassing. Would you like your future in-laws to say that to you?  Even if u probably knew it was right, would you not feel slightly humiliated?\n\nAnd yes, your brother should have stepped in and said something when it was voiced, stopping any involvement in disputes or drama. \n\nMaybe an apology is needed for how it came out, but to explain the frustration and why it was there in the first place.  To be honest you need to talk to her, not your brother. \n\nI do think you should ask to talk/sit with her and communicate that to her,  you need to feel friendship first to create a familial bond. She is a part of the family and she is very welcome, but sometimes you and certain members have traditions that will exclude her and not take it as a slight. Also say your own personal boundaries, that you do not want to certain discuss things and that is just you as a person.  Suggest something bonding for the two of you to do....and hopefully, she takes the bate. Her asking you to be MOH might have been her way of doing so.  But give her the road map to being someone you care about- I'm sure she'll do it. If she doesnt take the advice, you have literally given her the key to the kingdom. \n\nIf she doesnt respond reasonably, you can say wholeheartedly you tried. \n\nCan I ask a question- why wasn't she invited to the cabin? was it a mother-daughter thing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have sister in laws- and it would also be annoyed if they there acting this way , but if no one has said anything to her, you can not expect the behaviour to change.", "ESH\nYou are plain rude\nShe can't resoect boundaries\nHer husband did not comunicate well your concerns", "Wow first off all she has never had a family and is maybe a little over excited to be a part of one this is new to her she will not understand boundaries yet she will have seen on screen family's and want what they have bless her and fir you to be so uncaring is shocking she sounds a little lonely but lovely at least she is trying maybe you should too", "YTA\n\nPerhaps not for what you said but how you said it.\n\nJenny probably doesn't understand the boundaries and is desperate to feel like being part of a family and is now feeling intense rejection.

Maybe just approach her and tell her gently how she might need some therapy and how her behaviour is unnatural because I don\u2019t think this chick knows how to be a part of a family or build relationships. Still, nta for snapping finally because that\u2019s natural too", "YTA. Apologize. Jesus christ. She's trying hard. Can you blame her? She doesn't know how to family, and you totally steamroll her.  \nYou should have talked to your brother about this, and urged him to make her take a more humble approach to you, if that is what you desire.\n\nI've seen the foster system from the inside. Lived it to, for all my childhood.  \nPeople like you... yeah. You're the asshole.", "YTA - this person has a mental illness. Be cool for god's sake.", "ESH - this all sounds quite messy.\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a family and perhaps her understanding of what a family is and what she wants is different than what yours which is okay.

YTA for that comment but not on putting in some boundaries.", "You should have talked to her way earlier about this in a more friendly way. \nYour brother failed talking to her (if he even did).\nBut your reaction was just cruel. There is no excuse for that.\n\nEven if she didn\u2019t grow up without a family, this is a really mean thing to say. It will sting for a long time if not even for ever.\nMaybe she is pushy, maybe she oversteps, but I think she is just excited and thinks that this is something that family does. Why not have a normal talk with her? \n\nShe even wanted to make you her maid of honour like a sister. She is desperately trying.

We all tried to welcome Jenny, especially knowing that she grew up in the foster care system and didn\u2019t have family. We tried to get to know her, but she seemed to want an instant intimate connection rather than building one. Me and my younger (step) sister Chelsea (22) bore the brunt of her neediness but our parents have also expressed concerns. \n\nSince she met us she has been trying to insert herself into pictures, family disputes, and social events. She has no boundaries. We\u2019ve all talked to Nico about it so many times, even sitting him down as a family and he keeps saying he will talk to her but nothing changes, and it\u2019s got worse since the engagement. She tried to make me her Maid of Honour, demanded my mother throw her a bridal shower, started calling my parents Mom and Dad even though they asked her not to, and reached out to distant family members that we don\u2019t even talk to to tell them about the engagement. \n\nLast week we were all (Chelsea, Nico, me, and our partners) staying at our parents\u2019 place. Jenny, Nico, and my bf were the only ones not up yet and the rest of us were in the kitchen. Chelsea, my mum, and I were talking about taking a weekend trip. Jenny came in, having overheard us, saying it sounded like fun and proceeded to invite herself along. I was pretty annoyed by this and said she couldn\u2019t just invite herself. Jenny said why wouldn\u2019t she be invited, and I said because marrying Nico doesn\u2019t give you a blanket invite to every single thing all his family does. Jenny got upset and said she would really like to be included in our family, since it was the only one she knows and she doesn\u2019t have a proper family. I said I know that and we all sympathise but that doesn\u2019t mean we owe you a new one. \n\nThe whole room was silent and Jenny got up and went back upstairs. She didn\u2019t come out the rest of the day but Nico came down to chew me out over what I said. Our parents defended me saying he had an opportunity to talk to Jenny and he didn\u2019t. He and Jenny left the same day and he\u2019s now only keeping low level contact with everyone.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve spoken to him since he\u2019s just said I went way too low with what I said to Jenny and that I\u2019ve set her back mentally and that she\u2019s really down. I do feel bad, but I also feel like Jenny has been overstepping. We are all open to a relationship with her (we all have good relationships with partners in the family) but she never really made a genuine effort to build relationships with us, she just decided she was entitled to them, which I think isn\u2019t fair. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should reach out to Nico or Jenny with a more fervent apology, which I will if I have really screwed up here. I don\u2019t want to be the reason Nico stops talking to us. I just feel like he dropped the ball by letting it get to this point.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

An apology is probably in your best interest though to be fair", "YTA. You lack empathy for someone who never had a family and is trying to figure it out. I hope you and your family are ready to lose a relationship with your brother and their future kids. OMG your parents need to get over themselves\u2014don\u2019t call me mom and dad. She is going to be married to their son. I would never tell my future son in law or daughter in law they can\u2019t call me mom. Some of my adult kids friends call me mom it\u2019s not that big of a deal.", "Yeah honestly I really feel bad for OP, the family and Jenny. Nico set them all up for this inevitability instead of talking to his partner about boundaries and not approaching things so intensely. \n\nI can see how Jenny saw this new family as finally hers. I get how she likely came on too strong and too fast. And I can see how it would be overstepping and creating uncomfortable situations for the others involved. Frankly if Nico had talked to Jenny she probably could have gotten the relationships she wanted with these people because it would have developed organically. \n\nThis all boils down to Nico not wanting to have the uncomfortable conversation that he needs to have to make this situation better for everyone.", "This. His strategy was to placate his family with empty promises until they just give up and accept Jenny the way she wants to be accepted. A new version of \"fake it till you make it\", I guess. And now he's pissed because that blew up in his face.\n\nOP is NTA; it's on Nico for not having handled the situation earlier.", "I would\u2019ve been frustrated to in Op\u2019s position but I do feel bad for Jenny. She\u2019s been annoying, not malicious, and I think that comment will stay with her for a long time.", "This is really well said. I feel for everybody in this situation.", "I disagree, Jenny has crossed way too many lines at this point and op's response while undeniably harsh, was also justified. She overrides and ignores the wishes of every one around her, makes people uncomfortable and continues even when those people ask her to stop. The gentle approach has not worked, she needed the reality check. She can\u2019t just invite herself along to things, start calling her in-laws mom and dad even when they've expressed it makes them uncomfortable, try and talk about her sex life with op when they've expressed it makes them uncomfortable, and expect no consequences and everyone to pander to her just because her childhood sucked. NTA.", " Edit: OP actually *did* say something similar to what I said below, so props on that. It sounds like she got frustrated and said the harshest version of what everyone was thinking, but it's not the \"is it understandable that I got frustrated\" sub, it's \"am I the asshole\", so still ESH.        \n     \nAgreed on all of this. Personally, I think OP could have said something about how being part of a family doesn't mean being invited to every single family activity, which is true; while I wasn't in foster care, my husband's family has very much become more of a family to me than my blood-related parents because of how they treat me, but that doesn't mean I have to be invited to Every Single Thing my MIL does by herself or with my SIL because Family.", "What else should OP have said?", "The same way you build a friendship. You start with casual conversation, you find some common ground, and you build it like a Lego. Frankly, Jenny has friends, she should know how to do that. \n\nFor example, the second time I met Jenny she said I should feel comfortable telling her about my sex life because \u201csisters tell each other that stuff\u201d\u2026like\u2026no? I just met you. Honestly it\u2019s likely not something I\u2019ll ever share with her because I don\u2019t want her reciprocating given she has sex with my *brother* but again, second time I\u2019ve ever seen her. She\u2019s not my \u201csister\u201d.", "We have humoured her. We\u2019ve humoured her for two years, but since the engagement it\u2019s gone into overdrive. It was embarrassing for my parents to get messages from their cousins and second cousins who they see once every five years asking who Jenny was because she was sending them Facebook messages. It\u2019s hard to not be able to have any conversation with a family member where she can see you because she has to know the details of what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think Jenny needs to know about my sex life, just because I\u2019m telling Chelsea. It\u2019s not the same. \n\nAgain, I understand she\u2019s not used to the dynamics but at the same time, she has friends. She built those relationships why can\u2019t she build these ones?", "She is in family pictures, but sometimes my parents want pictures of just me, Nico, and Chelsea, and she insists on being in them, even when our other partners aren\u2019t. She\u2019s not not in any pictures, she\u2019s just not in all the pictures. \n\nNo, no one is upset about her background.", "Nico is really close to my mom. \n\nWe don\u2019t have disputes near people, and they\u2019re not big arguments. We bicker. Me and my mom will be bickering about something irrelevant in the kitchen, Jenny will come in, demand to know what\u2019s going on, and try to mediate. Like, even if it were Chelsea doing that I\u2019d be like, this has nothing to do with you. Or Jenny will hear about some random (again small) issue Chelsea is having with our parents and start texting our parents and Chelsea her thoughts on the argument\u2026why? \n\nWe *want* a relationship with her, but we just want to build it over time, and we try to do that. But if it\u2019s not instant Brady Bunch she doesn\u2019t want it.", "Thank you!! Its norma to throw a shower for your brother. They are obviously around a ton. OP just sounds jealous to me.", "You hit the nail on the head. I think that\u2019s what bothers me the most about OPs take on this-she\u2019s acting like Jenny is an entitled AH. Jenny isn\u2019t an Ah, she just doesn\u2019t know how to forge family relationships. and she IS family, as soon as they are officially married it\u2019s real. she desperately wants family. she might be annoying and doing it wrong, but she\u2019s not a monster.  I think OP acted like an ass/mean girl, but OP is also not an asshole, if that makes sense.", "No. We offered to talk to her, but Nico didn\u2019t want us to.", "Yep, my thoughts exactly.", "I get that she\u2019s going to be family, but I don\u2019t have intimate relationships with all my family either. And even the ones I do, they don\u2019t insert themselves into my life or relationships. Nico is my family, but if I\u2019m arguing with my mother, I don\u2019t expect that he will come in and try to mediate, because family or not that has nothing to do with him, whereas Jenny will come in and decide she needs to know all the details of what we\u2019re arguing about and start giving unsolicited opinions. That\u2019s not really the kind of family we are. \n\nNo, none of our other partners call our parents mom and dad and in our area/culture that\u2019s very unusual. I know from friends I have who come from different cultures that it\u2019s more common but to us it isn\u2019t. And common or not, my parents have asked her many times not to do that. \n\nNico isn\u2019t the black sheep, Chelsea and I are just very close to each other. Nico is very close to my mom and as close to his dad as the rest of us are. And no one dislikes Jenny, we\u2019re just uncomfortable with some of her actions. \n\nI have a great relationship with Chelsea\u2019s boyfriend, he\u2019s like an extra brother to me, but that developed over a period of time. He didn\u2019t come to one dinner and then think we were literally siblings. Similarly, I\u2019m close to my boyfriend\u2019s sister, but again, it happened organically, and gradually. We built a foundation for a friendship. Jenny isn\u2019t interested in that. If she\u2019s not like bio family today it doesn\u2019t have value to her. Or at least, that\u2019s how she presents it. \n\nAt the end of the day, I feel it\u2019s a compromise, and thus far she hasn\u2019t really compromised, she\u2019s just pushed.", "Sounds like Jenny doesn't take no for an answer, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn\u2019t a question, and she just said \"and you'll be my maid of honor\". She's no respecting boundaries which makes Jenny an undeniable ah. She calls her in-laws mom and dad even though they said it makes them uncomfortable, and just steamrolls everyone else's emotions because she thinks her sense of belonging is more important than anyone else's comfort which makes her an automatic ah", "I don't perceive OP's family as unwelcoming. It's also really weird you are giving yourself a compliment and saying you would definitely be welcoming. It's like \"nice guys\" saying they're nice.\n\nIf someone you know but have not built a relationship with is asking you to be MOH, dont you think that's odd?", "I agree. She sounds like she is eager to find a family. However, growing up in foster care, she didn't learn much about dynamics. Calling your parents Mom & Dad-What's wrong with that? I mean, unless she started doing that the 2nd time she met them, this is something that happens with in laws. I wouldn't be surprised if: once they have their own family she & Nico don't see your family much because of y'all's rejections (and there are many). OR she breaks up with Nico.\n\nMOH is a role that can be politely declined. I hope you didn't tell her your real reasons. They've been together for 2 years. When  is your family going to quit gatekeeping the family and let her in? Yes, she is overly eager. Maybe you should chat with her, apologize, and ask if she can move more slowly.", "The parents asked her many times not to call them Mom and Dad, how is that not trying to slow her down?", "She insert herself in family disputes that don't concern her, she reached out to family they aren't in contact anymore, she keeps inviting herself to stuff. At some point, someone needed to tell her to stop doing that. And her coming from foster care is not an excuse for being intrusive and not respecting people's privacy", "Would you say the same thing if it was a stepmother who wanted to force a mother/daughter relationship because she couldn't have children of her own?", "How is reaching out to my parents\u2019 second cousins who they haven\u2019t spoken to in five years and messaging them on Facebook not unreasonable? How is telling my mother to throw her a bridal shower while my mom is helping out her dying BIL already not unreasonable? Like\u2026", "Both my parents have asked her many many times politely not to call them that, she stops for the duration of that meeting and starts doing it again the next. It\u2019s the same with asking probing personal questions, be that about my sex life, my therapy, my medication.", "[deleted]", "I feel like if my parents want one picture of their three kids, that should be allowed. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s not in any pictures, but why can\u2019t we just have one with the three of us? \n\nNo, she demanded the bridal shower. She asked, my mom said no because she has work commitments and her BIL is sick so she is going back and forth helping out her sister, and Jenny just said \u201cbut you have to. I don\u2019t have a mom to do it so you have to\u201d. \n\nI get that it\u2019s normal some places, but it\u2019s not to us. And again, they\u2019ve asked her to stop several times. \n\nShe\u2019s announcing her engagement to people my parents haven\u2019t talked to in years. My parents got calls from their second cousins asking why Jenny was messaging them in Facebook. How is that not invasive?", "It\u2019s not fair to say we haven\u2019t tried. We have. We are trying to establish a genuine relationship with her but if it\u2019s not instant she doesn\u2019t want it.", "She is a grown woman who went to school, works and socialised with friends. She bloody well understands boundaries. She just doesn't want any when it comes to the family she is marrying into. And her partner did little to help his family or his fiance to build a bridge. OP is not at fault here. A grown woman with no respect and a weak willed man are the two most at fault.", "But that\u2019s the point. She isn\u2019t trying to *make* anything. She arrived and just thought she can take what\u2019s already there. I *want* a relationship with her, I have a great relationship with my boyfriend\u2019s sister for example, but we built that over time. I didn\u2019t arrive at her house, say \u201chey sis, tell me your darkest secrets\u201d. The second time I met Jenny she told me I should tell her intimate things about my sex life because we\u2019re \u201csisters\u201d. She\u2019d been dating Nico for three months and I\u2019d only ever seen her twice. I\u2019m not saying one day we won\u2019t be close but you have to build it, and she doesn\u2019t want to.", "Because when I was writing it I thought I might say stepdad at some point and then I figured someone would ask which of us are bio related, same reason I mentioned Chelsea is technically my stepsister. I consider both Nico and Chelsea my siblings so it doesn\u2019t matter it was just how I started it and then didn\u2019t delete it.", "We did talk to him. We\u2019ve talked to him multiple times. He always says he will talk to her but nothing changes. We offered to talk to her directly and he didn\u2019t want us to.", "They did talk to the brother, he said he would handle it, but didn't.", "Why do you think that? We have zero evidence nor have we been told that, why would you assume?", "Maybe I should put this is in an edit because I thought it was obvious but apparently not - we do try to tell her. I have told her many times \u201cJenny I\u2019m really not comfortable discussing my sex life/ therapy/ medication etc. it\u2019s personal, can we just change the subject\u201d. Just like my parents have asked her many times not to call them mom and dad. She stops for the duration of that meeting and just starts again next time.", "Not that we have ever been told.", "The problem is that it's clear that Jenny wasn't responding to subtle.", "Nothing. Jenny wasn\u2019t gonna stop until she got her way or got checked.", "I am with you. I HATE people like this who have no boundaries.", "Yikes", "Woof. That\u2019s rough.", "Sounds like the people who try to force kids to call the new stepmom \"mom\" right away. Never ends well. I'm extremely introverted, among other things. I do not warm up to people quickly and keep most at arm's reach (or farther, lol). I can count the number of people I truly consider friends on one hand. But those people are as much my family as my biological one.\n\nI can understand not wanting to be the MOH. Is there something you have in common that you could, very carefully, use to get to know her  and let her get to know you? I don't think you said anything but the truth, but it did hurt her feelings. I'm not about to say you *should* apologize, but it's the kind of situation to consider one. \n\nHow do you balance your need to get to know her and her overarching *need* for the family ties you have always had? I have, well, not really ideas. Notions, maybe? Make plans for lunch? Neutral ground? Strict time limit unless you BOTH agree to extend it? Picnic? An afternoon at a museum or zoo or something you both find interesting? Having something neutral in front of you to talk about might take some of the edge off. I dunno, I'm just spitballing to see if anything sticks.\n\nIf her heart is in the right place and your brother can get her to understand she's been pushing too hard, maybe you can start over. Bro really needs to step up and have that very difficult conversation. That part is his responsibility, not yours. Good luck!", "What would you like the game plan going forward? I get the reaction if that is how she is out of the gate but it sounds like there is some trauma surrounding her actions. She isn\u2019t reacting rationally. NTA on your part, \n\nAlso, I would hope you see your brothers part in this if he never brought your concerns to Jenny. Was this the first time she was hearing that she is too much and too pushy? It might be good for you and your family to set the boundaries with her and not use your brother as a go between since he may not be conveying your concerns and boundaries to her. I think it would just be sucky if the situation was left like this.", "kinda going against the grain here, but growing up in foster care and without a \u201creal\u201d family sucks ass. having a *family* versus having *friends* is a totally different level of love that jenny has never had. imagine if you\u2019d gone your whole life without that type of unconditional support and love, then one day you think you might finally have a chance at that. i probably would\u2019ve been a bit much if i were her, too. i\u2019m not saying that she wasn\u2019t going a little overboard, i\u2019m just saying that i think some more empathy is due. what you said stung her and it\u2019s going to stay with her, especially if she was a foster kid.", "But saying \"no, I just met you\" at that early stage would have had a better outcome with less sting.\nAlso how did she \"make\" you her MoH and why is that a bad thing?   \nNTA btw, you had no other options at thay stage", "Yeah it sounds like your brother *really* needs to talk to her about boundaries. It seems like her problems are more social than familial. Jumping in on someone\u2019s conversation like that is never cool, regardless of how related you are to the people.", "So you have known her for two years, she\u2019s engaged to your brother, yet you still want to exclude her from photos and the regular things you do with family? What happens when she gets married? Is she still not considered family until you decide it?", "OK I feel for both,  but this statement of its embarrassing for my parents to get messages from cousins asking which Jenny is, that's just bullshit, there is NOTHING to get embarrassed about if she was inviting extended family, are they so pathetic they can't ask themselves?\n\nI get you frustrated but it also seems you are really set in your ways and Jenny better learn to let things happen the way we want them to, so everyone here is the asshole, I don't give a damn how frustrated people are you were being unnecessarily harsh, yoy and your family need to getba reality check as well, yoy are not royalty that should expect things only their way.\n\nESH", "This isn\u2019t an odd request.. my husbands family takes pictures like this all the time. One with just the adult kids and ones with their SO. It would be absolutely bizarre if anyone ever insisted on being in every photo", "All that needs to be said is- next pic we will take one with you and the kids.", "It sounds like you aren\u2019t engaged to the \u201cother partners\u201d. There is a difference.", "Have any of u talked about this issue with her beforehand?", "> We *want* a relationship with her\n\nLol you absolutely don\u2019t, but go off queen", "Probably because he knew you'd be an asshole about it like you were here.", "I think you need to take the time to explain this to her. Apologise for your comment because I don't think you wanted to make her feel that way. It was in the heat of the moment and lacked the nuance the situation deserved. You need to have an honest sit down about this, talk about your feelings and how it makes you feel. She may react badly at first due to rejection and embarrassment but if she is worth having a relationship with then you guys will be able to navigate this moving forward, like adults.\n\nWith regards to the butting into arguments, Jenny may have often had to play mediator growing up and thinks that is how to handle situations in every family. Tell her that it's not that you don't want HER opinion, but that it isn't how arguments are handled in your family. You don't want her to involve herself the same way you wouldn't want Nico to. \n\nTalk about the time thing. She may have observed all of these close relationships between your family and partners but explain how it wasn't instant. If you can, add specific examples of when you started to specifically include them in outings, hang out or communicate outside of their connection to your sibling, it may help her understand a more appropriate timeline. Let her know that her pushing has stalled a more genuine connection forming on your end but you would like to let one develop. Maybe come up with something (a group  chat, outing, activity etc.) that is casual, low-key and a compromise to help provide her with a way forward so she doesn't retreat entirely.", "Im not going to knock you for not being overly fond of someones partner choice. But we cannot choose who our loved ones choose to marry.

I get that Nico didn't want you to, but couldn't you be kind?  Have a sit down and talk to her about what you are and aren't comfortable with?

Yes, your brother should\u2019ve talk to her I totally 100% agree with that. But you are all adults and any one of you could\u2019ve sat Jenny down and told her what she was doing how she was coming off and how she needed to back off a little bit and slowly build relationships with everybody.", "It's not instant I agree but the poor lass as never had a family and has probably craved what you have had all her life she will have boundary issues as she has never been a part of a family before by the sounds of things she has fell in love with you all give her a little patience and she might turn into a wonderful addition to your family", "[deleted]", "If you love your brother, you will bring this girl into the fold. Don't you see she wants to belong so bad with you guys? You truly have no clue what it is like to be brought up in the system. It's more than not having a family. There's severe abuse, neglect, fighting for resources. You guys have a chance to show this girl the world isn't just one big sh\\*thole. At the moment, all you are doing is reinforcing whatever abandonment issues she's got going on. \n\nAnd before anyone comes on here crying tattoo tears and spewing a bunch of mush mouth bs,  you all need to be better people. Put yourself in her shoes. Don't sympathise with her, actually empathise. Imagine how you would feel if this were you. I think if you guys give her a chance, she might be receptive to therapy. EMDR therapy can help her deal with the abandonment issues. That's if you want this woman to be part of your family, which in all honesty, sounds like you don't.", "If she grew up in the foster system she has some trauma either parental death or abuse.\n\nFrom context I gather she either had a poor or distant relationship with her foster family or she moved around a lot either way she didn't have a \"family.\" So that no or poor emotional development and nurturing.\n\nNeediness and rapid intense emotional bonds are signs of mental illness. Particularly borderline personality disorder. Though you didn't mention other signs of that specifically here.\n\nNico said you \"set her back mentally\" set her back on her recovery or development I would understand that to mean. Also being down all the time, is depression. If she used to be down all the time she's depressed.\n\nTldr: because she has a history of trauma and your brother basically told you she does.", "I have two sisters and we never talk about our sex lives.  There\u2019s no doubt Jenny has had a tough go, but she needs to read the room.", "Not all photos. But if my parents are like \u201cokay just one of the kids\u201d meaning the three siblings, she\u2019ll insist on being in it, even when none of our other partners are. It\u2019s not like she can\u2019t be in any photos, but I don\u2019t think she should have to be in all of them. \n\nThere\u2019s nothing we do as a family that she isn\u2019t invited to. She\u2019s not invited to every bilateral hangout I have with my mom or my sister, but neither is Nico. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s weird.", "So my parents are never allowed to have pictures of just their kids ever again?", "No. Just with Nico. We offered to talk to Jenny directly but Nico told us not to and that he would handle it.\n\nETA: we have given pushback on individual situations, like my parents asking her not to call them mom and dad or me saying \u201cJenny I don\u2019t really want to discuss my medication with you, it\u2019s private\u201d but we haven\u2019t had a larger conversation about the overall vibe.", "I wouldn\u2019t either. She sounds annoying and invasive as fuck.", "I have friends that call their in-laws Mom & Dad, usually interspersed with calling them by their 1st names. Growing up, all of my 2 boys friends called me Ma. That has evolved into their spouses doing the same. Their friends still cal me Ma. In my opinion, I am blessed by this. It's an honor.", "OP stated so in a comment.", "Uh, no. I\u2019m saying why would you look up my parents\u2019 second cousins, who you\u2019ve probably never heard of because again we don\u2019t talk to them much, and start messaging? Like\u2026why?", "Actually OP clarified why she called him step-brother under my original comment, so I am going to remove my snarky remark.", "No. We offered to, but Nico said no because he was afraid it would embarrass her.", "Don't do this. In-laws have friction. Let the person who wants to make things work be the intermediary. This is in-law rule number one. If you try to lay down the law, you will become known as the evil in-law. You might even make Jenny reject your whole family, which seems like maybe you'd be fine with, but she'll take Nico with her.", "We push back on individual instances when she\u2019s overstepping, yes. She stops and then next time we see her it\u2019s back to square one. We offered to have a more in depth conversation with her but Nico said no, he would handle it.", "It\u2019s not weird but underlying this is your gatekeeping of what you consider family. The way you treated her could have been handled in so many better ways.", "This family is just as toxic as poor Jenny trying to fit in, they have zero concept on what it feels to be kept out of things, I understand the frustration but if they really wanted her to be family, they could sit down all of them and explain this to Jenny as well, to me it proves they really don't want to try", "Apparently not, according to some of these gross responses.", "No you\u2019re right. That\u2019s not how extended families work. There are still instances where it will be just the immediate family minus the partners. Frankly it\u2019s healthy, now if you are excluding the partners a lot that\u2019s a different story. But that\u2019s not what\u2019s going on here. Honestly it\u2019s really on Nico to have had this conversation. But I think now that you\u2019ve said what you did it\u2019s worth reaching out and asking if you could take her to lunch to apologize and talk. You where a bit harsh but maybe by opening that door you can now talk with her about the boundaries. Bring up the sex life thing, express you want to become close with her but it\u2019s not an automatic process and it takes time like good friendships do. Idk this is a really difficult position to be in and it shouldn\u2019t be put on you but your brother really screwed the pooch on this one and dropped the ball (to toss in a few colloquialisms)", "Question: because I know another family like this, who will take pictures with the (grand)parents and the adult kids, and the grandkids, but leave the partners to the side watching. It comes off as \u201cpartners aren\u2019t blood or real family\u201d. So when kids are introduced into the mix, do you think photos will be taken where everyone is in them or where partners are still left out so the parents can \u201chave pictures of just their kids\u201d and grandkids? \n\nI hope this doesn\u2019t seem like an unfair question but it at least serves as a thought exercise as to where this practice is going as everyone ages and the family continues to expand.\n\nAlso curious about the answer to the question a few other people asked above: when she \u201ctried\u201d to make you MOH, does that mean she asked you?", "Changing my vote to n t a, I know there's limitation on how much u may write, but it wouldbe good to add this ETA, I thought you came out of nowhere when confronting her", "Ok, thanks.", "So basically, his plan was never to talk to her and just hope you all continue to just humor her and nobody ever said anything to her? Yeah, you didn\u2019t do anything wrong she needed to hear it from somebody.", "Yeah like maybe talking to her partner to get him to gently tell her to watch people\u2019s boundaries\u2026", "Yea but honestly if she was like this from the be very beginning and for over two years it likely ended backfiring and working against her. People who trespass boundaries make the people around them protect their own boundaries even more. \n\nAnd the OP is describing isn\u2019t gatekeeping. In any family you\u2019re allowed to still have 1:1 or sub-group socializing. Not every single thing has to include every single person.", "They did that\u2026 repeatedly", "Yeah I should have added a /s"]}
