{"id": 24238, "submission_id": "15mb8ih", "title": "AITA for telling my brother\u2019s fianc\u00e9 that we don\u2019t owe her a family?", "selftext": "My (F25) (step)brother Nico (29) has recently got engaged to a woman called Jenny after dating for two years. We all tried to welcome Jenny, especially knowing that she grew up in the foster care system and didn\u2019t have family. We tried to get to know her, but she seemed to want an instant intimate connection rather than building one. Me and my younger (step) sister Chelsea (22) bore the brunt of her neediness but our parents have also expressed concerns. \n\nSince she met us she has been trying to insert herself into pictures, family disputes, and social events. She has no boundaries. We\u2019ve all talked to Nico about it so many times, even sitting him down as a family and he keeps saying he will talk to her but nothing changes, and it\u2019s got worse since the engagement. She tried to make me her Maid of Honour, demanded my mother throw her a bridal shower, started calling my parents Mom and Dad even though they asked her not to, and reached out to distant family members that we don\u2019t even talk to to tell them about the engagement. \n\nLast week we were all (Chelsea, Nico, me, and our partners) staying at our parents\u2019 place. Jenny, Nico, and my bf were the only ones not up yet and the rest of us were in the kitchen. Chelsea, my mum, and I were talking about taking a weekend trip. Jenny came in, having overheard us, saying it sounded like fun and proceeded to invite herself along. I was pretty annoyed by this and said she couldn\u2019t just invite herself. Jenny said why wouldn\u2019t she be invited, and I said because marrying Nico doesn\u2019t give you a blanket invite to every single thing all his family does. Jenny got upset and said she would really like to be included in our family, since it was the only one she knows and she doesn\u2019t have a proper family. I said I know that and we all sympathise but that doesn\u2019t mean we owe you a new one. \n\nThe whole room was silent and Jenny got up and went back upstairs. She didn\u2019t come out the rest of the day but Nico came down to chew me out over what I said. Our parents defended me saying he had an opportunity to talk to Jenny and he didn\u2019t. He and Jenny left the same day and he\u2019s now only keeping low level contact with everyone.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve spoken to him since he\u2019s just said I went way too low with what I said to Jenny and that I\u2019ve set her back mentally and that she\u2019s really down. I do feel bad, but I also feel like Jenny has been overstepping. We are all open to a relationship with her (we all have good relationships with partners in the family) but she never really made a genuine effort to build relationships with us, she just decided she was entitled to them, which I think isn\u2019t fair. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should reach out to Nico or Jenny with a more fervent apology, which I will if I have really screwed up here. I don\u2019t want to be the reason Nico stops talking to us. I just feel like he dropped the ball by letting it get to this point.\n\nEdit - okay I\u2019m adding this because I thought it was implied but maybe not. We do push back when Jenny is being intrusive. I can\u2019t count how many times I have said \u201cJenny I\u2019m not comfortable talking about my sex life/therapy/medication etc., it\u2019s really personal, can we just change the subject\u201d. We move on from the conversation but the next time I talk to her it\u2019s back to square one. Same with my parents, they politely ask her not to call them mom and dad, and she stops for the duration of that conversation, and then starts again next time. We\u2019ve never had a more in depth conversation with her, we offered, and Nico said no, he would talk to her.\n\nEdit 2: for everyone saying I should consider Jenny family because she\u2019s engaged to Nico, that isn\u2019t what I meant with that comment. I commented this elsewhere but I\u2019m copying because it encapsulates when I was trying to get across. \n\nI never said or meant that she isn\u2019t part of the family. I guess what I meant with what I said was, you can\u2019t parachute yourself in and expect us to be the family you deserve. Because the family every person deserves is one with their mom and their dad and it\u2019s happy and it\u2019s from birth, and you don\u2019t have do anything to earn it. Sadly, not everyone gets that. I know I didn\u2019t. And I know how much it must suck for her to feel like she has to work for what other people got for free. I have a shitty bio dad, so I kind of know. You think \u201cwhy do I have to be good and clever and kind and a million other things to have a good family while all anyone else has to do is just be born\u201d, and it\u2019s the worst. But when you come into a family that already exists that\u2019s the way it is. They learn to love you and it takes time. My stepdad didn\u2019t love me the second he met me, or love me just because he loved my mom, he got to know me, and figured out who I was as a person and he loved me for me. We wanted to have that opportunity with Jenny. And maybe that doesn\u2019t feel good enough for her and I guess it\u2019s not really fair that she doesn\u2019t have the other kind of unconditional love but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s up to us, or anyone, to fix. That\u2019s just my view.", "created_utc": 1691576313, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mb8ih/aita_for_telling_my_brothers_fianc\u00e9_that_we_dont/", "score": 9843, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He wants everyone to say nothing. NTA.", "NAH. I can not blame you for snapping and I can not blame Jenny for wanting a close family. Growing up in the way she did can result in an intense longing for connection and safety and a lack of proper communication skills. \n\nShe shouldn't insert herself in everyones business like that, but she also seems to not understand why. I hope she and your brother can work through that together. \n\nOn the other hand, I completely understand that it feels very invasive if someone does this to you, even if you understand where they are coming from. The way you said it was a bit harsh, but I assume tension has been building up over time. \n\nI do think its good to talk it out with her oncr all the emotions have settled and I hope your brother can facilitate the process. She needs to learn the nuance of being welcome, but not overstepping boundaries and it not being a sign of people not caring about you.", "I guess the AH here is Nico. He didnt tell her wife that making family relationship doesnt work that way. Jenny didnt know and only do what she can to feel having family. I feel her. But maybe if you have more compassion tell her that family didnt work that way.", "Well, Jenny was just going to keep pushing until *someone* pushed back, so this moment was more-or-less inevitable. You named the elephant in the room: Jenny's neediness, which your whole family had noticed.\n\nI don't know whether Nico failed to talk to her in private, or whether he did and she failed to heed his warnings. I also don't know if getting to join what she perceived as a close-knit family is a large part of what makes Nico attractive to her.\n\nBut I do know that your comment stung deeply, and Jenny won't stop feeling it for a *long* time.\n\nIt's not impossible that this precipitates a break-up between Nico and Jenny, and if it does, it is highly likely that the blame is going to come your way, so an apology is in your strategic interest, regardless of whether your comment was justified, or not.\n\nI think my final vote is going to be ESH; Jenny for being pushy, Nico for not warning her that her pushing wasn't going unnoticed, and you for saying something really wounding.", "I had to double check how long they were dating for since I expected this to be a quick courtship.\n\nNTA. I sympathize with her but your brother has had his chances to talk to her and either he's not actually talking to her or it isn't actually sinking in.\n\nI do feel a bit sorry for her with her wanting you to be MoH. It must be awkward not to have a strong friend/family base who can help out with things especially since she wants it so bad but it has to happen organically.. it can't be forced or fast tracked unless there is mutual trauma that affects both you and her.", "How would you have wanted her to build a relationship? It sounds like she was trying", "As an only child, I can relate to Jenny. I don\u2019t try to insert myself into my wife\u2019s family like Jenny is, but I really can understand where she\u2019s coming from. Some families are more in line with what she imagined. My mother in law acts like she\u2019s my mom, and I doubt I know her much better than Jenny knows yours. I\u2019ve had girlfriends in the past (not a spouse, just a girlfriend) who\u2019s siblings or cousins fully embraced me as part of the family, pretty much the reverse of what Jenny is doing.\n\nNTA because you guys are allowed to live your own way. But maybe cut her some slack. If she\u2019s acting like one of the family, just roll with it. Unless there are some other problems you haven\u2019t mentioned, there\u2019s no harm in humoring her most of the time, especially if it leads to a deeper connection.", "NTA", "NTA your brother should have had a talk with her long ago about overstepping. Much like when step parents come into a situation, you can't force a relationship. She needs to take time to actually establish relationships instead of trying to force her way in.\n\nI sympathize with her situation but that doesn't give her the right to suddenly shoehorn her way into your family. If she had taken it slowly or if your brother had given her the guidance of taking it slowly she could have worked her way into a closer bonds but now I doubt it will ever be what she wanted it to be.", "NTA- it\u2019s like that saying \u201cyou have to earn respect before you get respect\u201d\n\nShe did none of that", "NTA-its your family and she needs to respect that! It is a harsh situation but she needs to take responsibility of her own life.", "If she\u2019s engaged to him why would she need to \u201cinsert herself\u201d into family pictures, isn\u2019t she just part of the family? When she tried to make you her maid of honor does that mean she asked you? There\u2019s some stuff here that has some subtext of you all just being mean. Did your family not like that he was dating someone \u201cwithout a family\u201d?", "Ok, the fact that you finally snapped, and NOBODY: Your sister, your mother, your father, said anything, in fact they supported you, speaks volumes.

I can't imagine what she went through, but that is what counseling is for, not your in laws. You can't expect people to just act how you want them to act.", "You know, harsh as it was, the OP might have done Nico a favour. It is starting to sound like Jenny was more interested in marrying into a family than she is in marrying her fiance, and getting that into the open may cause a rethink.", "INFO: How is the relationship between stepbro and his stepparent? It's weird that you don't want to include someone in a photo unless your family is going to a studio to take one, it's also weird that ur family has disputes near someone that it isn't close to u all, it's also weird that u guys keep talking about events near someone u don't wanna invite, It's weird that u are upset that she reached out to people in ur family to announce her engagement, it's her engagement not urs, this just sound like 'how dare her, talk to someone we didn't allow'. Ur stepbro is engaged to this woman if you all don't like her it's understandable that he goes LC. what did u expect that he would come see u all and leave her alone? NTA.", "NAH, maybe the lightest of Y-T-As. You weren't wrong, but you could have been gentler. \n\nThe real issue is that it's obvious that Jenny doesn't KNOW how to build a relationship gradually -- this is very much an effect of growing up in foster care. I mean, it was true of me and I didn't even grow up in foster care, I just grew up in a weird crappy family environment. Doing this kind of thing gradually is a skill that a person has to learn, and no one taught her. That's not her fault. I think it might benefit everyone here if you don't think of her as entitled, but instead as naive. The good news is that naivete is much easier to fix than entitlement! It's a skill she hasn't learned and people learn new skills all the time. Has anyone considered actually talking to her or trying to teach her instead of putting it all on Nico?\n\nI'm not saying it's necessarily your *responsibility* to teach her, but when it comes to family, as long as we're not talking about abuse it's generally better not to die on the hill of whose responsibility it is to fix something and just get to fixing it.", "NTA\n\n She sounds exhausting to be around honestly. I'm surprised no one snapped before now", "Query: has no one spoken directly to Jenny about this? Why leave it to Nico?", "NTA- your brother had the chance to talk to her and tell her she\u2019s being to much , but he didn\u2019t\u2026 why should you and the rest of your family be left feeling uncomfortable", "NTA. When you enter a family you wear your dancing shoes, to learn to dance to their tunes while teaching them yours and see if you can harmonize. \n\nWhat Jenny did was show up in armored clocks and proceeded to stamp on every single toe that was unfortunate enough to be near her, never thinking of the fact that nobody else knew her dances nor where they wearing armored shoes.", "while i can understand your feelings i have to say YTA.\n\nThis is a woman who has never lived a normal family life. she doesn't understand how to have and make family connections like you or i might. she has spent her whole life craving a family and her last chance (beside making her own) was joining into whoever she marries family.\n\ni could understand if she had any sort of ill intentions- but i think she means well and is just having a hard time at it. and unfortunately like it or not- once they marry she is technically family either way. she must have seen how you are with other partners and thought she can do the same.\n\ndo anyone elses partners call your parents mom and dad? to me this is a completely normal thing. my mother calls her husbands mother \"mom\". Many people practice that and i cant see how its that big of a deal if it makes this woman feel apart of the family. Im not sure by this story that you've all made her as included as you say you have.\n\nIf i have to be honest, it sounds like your STEP brother is already a black sheep of some sort and no one really cares for jenny and she can feel it. i think your comment towards her was completely inappropriate. \n\nif you want them both as apart of your family, it many be time for everyone to accept that she is family. that means shes included in photos, disputes, trips, etc. theres 100 million ways you could've handled this differently.\n\nFor example- when she tried to invite herself on the trip you could of said \"Jenny- we would love to go on a trip with you but we have planned this as a mom and daughter trip. Lets plan a trip together for all of us to go on afterwards (including any other female spouses) \n\nhave you thought maybe she's trying to force herself in somewhere she doesnt feel welcome because she is desperate to be liked and accepted into a family? i think you all need to have more compassion", "She sounds like someone with a few mental problems. Good luck to your family.", "YTA. You lost me at \"She tried to make me her Maid of Honour\". Your future sister-in-law asked you to be her Maid of Honor, and not only were you honored but you declined, and not only did you decline you are actually blaming her for asking. I really feel sorry for Jenny. After all those years in foster care she ended up with your unwelcoming family. Had she married into my family or any of my friend's she'd be included and we'd be happy to have her.", "ESH \nShe seems to be so entrenched with the idea of having a family that she skipped a couple of steps and is now crossing boundaries.\n\nYou could've said it better. You do not owe her a family - she has now gone low contact and hopefully she stays that way. She is your brother's fiancee and hopefully when she goes low contact it stays that way along with her future kids.\n\n\nThere's nothing worse than staying where she is not wanted which is what your message is. - We don't owe you a family.", "I\u2019m sorry, but I have to say YTA. I get your frustration with with how she pushed herself in to everything, but she doesn\u2019t know better, because she doesn\u2019t have family so she can know the proper boundaries. That isn\u2019t her fault and now you\u2019re making her feel unwelcome because of it. You could have said, \u201chey, this is only a trip for just us, next time maybe?\u201dThere\u2019s ways to handle this and you chose to hurt her. YTA.", "YTA, you know she's never had family and most likely has no idea how to interact with one. All she knows is what media and social influence portrays families to be. \n\nTo sit and berate a person for wanting to be close to the family they're marrying into is just assinine. \n\nI imagine you owe her an apology and explanation on where you're coming from. And maybe as her FSIL you could help her meld with your family rather than just be the back end of humanity.", "NTA - Jenny is sympathetic and needs a therapist, but Nico is an AH for not cutting this off beforehand.\n\nI have no problem being direct with pushy people who don't understand when someone is trying to be subtle. You weren't even unkind.", "YTA  All of you.  She probably has no clue how to do this family stuff.   Her fiance and all of you let her go on thinking she was ok. Thinking she had a family.  None of you tried slowing her down.   None of you gave her any sort of idea she was wrong.", "YTA you know she comes from foster care. You say you have empathy for her but you don't. You just decided long ago that because she was persistent on having a relationship you wouldn't let her have one. Shame on you!", "Major YTA", "OP you are unkind. It is normal for people to want to be included. Inviting you to participate in the wedding is an  honour not an insult. Of course you are not obliged to be in it or have her on trips. But it sounds like you enjoy being nasty and ganging up her for the audacity to want to belong to your family.\n\nNot to worry. I think she might have caught on. I suspect that you won't be seeing a lot of your brother or his family in the future. That's your loss not hers. YTA.", "YTA\n\nNothing you\u2019ve listed seems unreasonable of her.  It all is normal things that a new person coming into a family would do.\n\nYou\u2019ve had two years to get used to the fact that she is part of the family.", "It's tough, but imo YTA, you could have used more tact.  I see where she is coming from, it's like giving a kid candy for the first time, they want it so badly.", "YTA. \n\nYou complained about her trying to build a relationship with you in her way, then said she never made a \"genuine effort to build relationships\" with you all. \n\nShe even asked her future SIL to be her maid of honour and you react like it's weird. You know she doesn't have a relationship with her biological family! Of course she asked you! \n\nAnd to tell her that even after she marries your brother, she won't actually be family (at least I'll bet that's what she heard, and how I read it), is incredibly low. Your brother is right to go low contact until you ALL apologize for how you've treated the person he loves. \n\nSuck it up, apologize, and actually give Jenny a chance.", "YTA.\n\nGrowing up in the foster care system may be the least of her problems.... why was she there in the first place?  \n\nIt's miserly of you to come from a place of such wealth (I mean emotional wealth,  knowing you are loved, have a place, surrounded by family) and yet be so lacking in empathy or compassion for this girl who's had none of that.  She hasn't 'decided she's entitled' to your family.... what a Scrooge thing to say.  She just desperately wants to fit in and ....gasp...even feel a little of the love you obviously show each other.\n\nOf course she hasn't learned your family's boundaries.  Of course she's over the moon about maybe having a family for once.  Of course she's overstepping trying to learn how to love and be loved.\n   \nAnd thinking that you can talk to your brother...who will then talk to his fiance... and this will be enough to 'fix' her.  The lot of you sound like you've no emotional intelligence,  except your brother. \n\nYou *have* seriously screwed up, and your excuses are painful to hear.  Since you think it'll work towards your brother's fiance... let's see if this approach works for you.  I'll simply tell you what to feel and do and you will yeh?.... be curious about this girl, put aside yourself while you listen to her and wonder how you could've coped with what she's been through.   Gently show her where there are times she isn't included and ensure you include her wherever possible *as a member of your family*.  Love your brother enough to respect his choices and not set him up to be the go-between.   Look for the good in everyone.   Oh...and stop and be truly grateful for what you've had and what you've got.", "YTA. And your brother will probably end up going no contact with you after a while if you don't accept her as family now. Sure she has boundary issues but as a family, you should be gentler in your responses than being as stone cold as you are. You feel she's acting entitled. Fair enough. But at this point, she's going to married to your brother and will be officially family. You might as well act like it now. Instead of waiting for a piece of paper. That's your problem.\n\nAnother problem, I think you guys just don't like her and trying to give rather benign reasons for it. Which is sad. Your brother probably suspects it and will probably further pull contact with you. How sad you can't open your hearts up to her, whether or not she had a bad background. It doesn't matter. Your brother loves her and you guys should be making an effort while also reinforcing boundaries:\n\n\"Sweetie, I appreciate the thought but please call me ____ and not mom\"\n\n\"Jenny, I'm uncomfortable talking about my sex life with anyone, that's just a me thing\".\n\nEtc etc.", "YTA\n\n>Since she met us she has been trying to insert herself into pictures,\n\nHow weird.

It sounds like she is not reading the situation correctly and being overly friendly, but that is not a reason to be mean. Nothing you are listing here is so over the top that it warrants a reaction like yours. Lots of people refer to their in laws as mother and father, and asking the grooms sister to be in the wedding, even a maid of honor, is quite nice. Also, if she has no family to do it, throwing her a bridal shower would actually be a nice thing to do. \n\nWhat it sounds like is she is being genuinely friendly and nice, and you are rebuffing her attempts and talking behind her back about her \"flaws\" often till they become a bigger deal to you guys than it actually is.", "NAH, except maybe your brother.

You could try talking to her but I wouldn\u2019t frame it as an apology more as you don\u2019t want this fight to ruin your relationship because you still value her. Tell her that family doesn\u2019t do everything together and to slow things down a bit.", "ESH-  \n\nShe is overstepping and there is a lack of self-awareness, there is no need for her to involve herself in family disputes and Inviting yourself to events is not polite. \n\nYour brother ignored the concerns when brought to him\n\nYou yourself have put expectations on how she should get close to you without communicating that to her. She will be a part of your family whether you like it or not. You can not gatekeep the access here. \n\nFacing facts- \n\nAs she doesnt have family, she probably isn't aware that she has to make 'friends' first or build that relationship. OR she got excited by the idea of an instant family and didnt reality check herself. Don't blame her for her lack of understanding or her excitement. The only thing you can do is communicate with her directly. She might have thought by going to all family events she was making that effort.  The way it came out in front of everyone, would be embarrassing. Would you like your future in-laws to say that to you?  Even if u probably knew it was right, would you not feel slightly humiliated?\n\nAnd yes, your brother should have stepped in and said something when it was voiced, stopping any involvement in disputes or drama. \n\nMaybe an apology is needed for how it came out, but to explain the frustration and why it was there in the first place.  To be honest you need to talk to her, not your brother. \n\nI do think you should ask to talk/sit with her and communicate that to her,  you need to feel friendship first to create a familial bond. She is a part of the family and she is very welcome, but sometimes you and certain members have traditions that will exclude her and not take it as a slight. Also say your own personal boundaries, that you do not want to certain discuss things and that is just you as a person.  Suggest something bonding for the two of you to do....and hopefully, she takes the bate. Her asking you to be MOH might have been her way of doing so.  But give her the road map to being someone you care about- I'm sure she'll do it. If she doesnt take the advice, you have literally given her the key to the kingdom. \n\nIf she doesnt respond reasonably, you can say wholeheartedly you tried. \n\nCan I ask a question- why wasn't she invited to the cabin? was it a mother-daughter thing?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI have sister in laws- and it would also be annoyed if they there acting this way , but if no one has said anything to her, you can not expect the behaviour to change.", "ESH\nYou are plain rude\nShe can't resoect boundaries\nHer husband did not comunicate well your concerns", "Wow first off all she has never had a family and is maybe a little over excited to be a part of one this is new to her she will not understand boundaries yet she will have seen on screen family's and want what they have bless her and fir you to be so uncaring is shocking she sounds a little lonely but lovely at least she is trying maybe you should too", "YTA\n\nPerhaps not for what you said but how you said it.\n\nJenny probably doesn't understand the boundaries and is desperate to feel like being part of a family and is now feeling intense rejection.

But I still feel kinda sorry for her. Maybe just approach her and tell her gently how she might need some therapy and how her behaviour is unnatural because I don\u2019t think this chick knows how to be a part of a family or build relationships. Still, nta for snapping finally because that\u2019s natural too", "YTA. Apologize. Jesus christ. She's trying hard. Can you blame her? She doesn't know how to family, and you totally steamroll her.  \nYou should have talked to your brother about this, and urged him to make her take a more humble approach to you, if that is what you desire.\n\nI've seen the foster system from the inside. Lived it to, for all my childhood.  \nPeople like you... yeah. You're the asshole.", "YTA - this person has a mental illness. Be cool for god's sake.", "Based on OPs reply to my comment, editing/changing to NTA. - this all sounds still sounds quite messy, however, given that you have tried to talk to her, asking for your brother to intervene makes sense. It\u2019s a tricky situation all around regardless and while your response may have been a bit harsh, it makes sense that something has to give at some point. It could be worth apologizing and saying acknowledging you reacted out of frustration and said hurtful words in large part because you\u2019ve tried to discuss things with her and nothing has changed. \n\nShe doesn\u2019t have a family and perhaps her understanding of what a family is and what she wants is different than what yours which is okay. ~~You should have talked to her and put up boundaries and said \u201chey, I\u2019m not comfortable with talking about X quite yet, let\u2019s chat about Y so I can get to know you a bit better.\u201d Instead, you decided since she made it clear she wanted a relationship and you weren\u2019t comfortable with how she went about it, that it\u2019s too bad so sad for her, she\u2019s not family and you\u2019re indifferent to her.~~\n\n~~Some of the things, like contacting extended family, does cross a line and your brother should address that. I\u2019d say she/he are slight AH in some of these instances.~~", "I think it\u2019s fine you pushed back on her being pushy. But I do think it was a low blow and it will cause permanent damage to your relationship with her and your brother. YTA for that comment but not on putting in some boundaries.", "You should have talked to her way earlier about this in a more friendly way. \nYour brother failed talking to her (if he even did).\nBut your reaction was just cruel. There is no excuse for that.\n\nEven if she didn\u2019t grow up without a family, this is a really mean thing to say. It will sting for a long time if not even for ever.\nMaybe she is pushy, maybe she oversteps, but I think she is just excited and thinks that this is something that family does. Why not have a normal talk with her? \n\nShe even wanted to make you her maid of honour like a sister. She is desperately trying. So think about how you would feel if someone reacted like that. \n\nYTA\n\nEdit: Wordcorrection.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We all tried to welcome Jenny, especially knowing that she grew up in the foster care system and didn\u2019t have family. We tried to get to know her, but she seemed to want an instant intimate connection rather than building one. Me and my younger (step) sister Chelsea (22) bore the brunt of her neediness but our parents have also expressed concerns. \n\nSince she met us she has been trying to insert herself into pictures, family disputes, and social events. She has no boundaries. We\u2019ve all talked to Nico about it so many times, even sitting him down as a family and he keeps saying he will talk to her but nothing changes, and it\u2019s got worse since the engagement. She tried to make me her Maid of Honour, demanded my mother throw her a bridal shower, started calling my parents Mom and Dad even though they asked her not to, and reached out to distant family members that we don\u2019t even talk to to tell them about the engagement. \n\nLast week we were all (Chelsea, Nico, me, and our partners) staying at our parents\u2019 place. Jenny, Nico, and my bf were the only ones not up yet and the rest of us were in the kitchen. Chelsea, my mum, and I were talking about taking a weekend trip. Jenny came in, having overheard us, saying it sounded like fun and proceeded to invite herself along. I was pretty annoyed by this and said she couldn\u2019t just invite herself. Jenny said why wouldn\u2019t she be invited, and I said because marrying Nico doesn\u2019t give you a blanket invite to every single thing all his family does. Jenny got upset and said she would really like to be included in our family, since it was the only one she knows and she doesn\u2019t have a proper family. I said I know that and we all sympathise but that doesn\u2019t mean we owe you a new one. \n\nThe whole room was silent and Jenny got up and went back upstairs. She didn\u2019t come out the rest of the day but Nico came down to chew me out over what I said. Our parents defended me saying he had an opportunity to talk to Jenny and he didn\u2019t. He and Jenny left the same day and he\u2019s now only keeping low level contact with everyone.\n\nWhen I\u2019ve spoken to him since he\u2019s just said I went way too low with what I said to Jenny and that I\u2019ve set her back mentally and that she\u2019s really down. I do feel bad, but I also feel like Jenny has been overstepping. We are all open to a relationship with her (we all have good relationships with partners in the family) but she never really made a genuine effort to build relationships with us, she just decided she was entitled to them, which I think isn\u2019t fair. \n\nI don\u2019t know if I should reach out to Nico or Jenny with a more fervent apology, which I will if I have really screwed up here. I don\u2019t want to be the reason Nico stops talking to us. I just feel like he dropped the ball by letting it get to this point.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

An apology is probably in your best interest though to be fair", "YTA. You lack empathy for someone who never had a family and is trying to figure it out. I hope you and your family are ready to lose a relationship with your brother and their future kids. OMG your parents need to get over themselves\u2014don\u2019t call me mom and dad. She is going to be married to their son. I would never tell my future son in law or daughter in law they can\u2019t call me mom. Some of my adult kids friends call me mom it\u2019s not that big of a deal.", "Yeah honestly I really feel bad for OP, the family and Jenny. Nico set them all up for this inevitability instead of talking to his partner about boundaries and not approaching things so intensely. \n\nI can see how Jenny saw this new family as finally hers. I get how she likely came on too strong and too fast. And I can see how it would be overstepping and creating uncomfortable situations for the others involved. Frankly if Nico had talked to Jenny she probably could have gotten the relationships she wanted with these people because it would have developed organically. \n\nThis all boils down to Nico not wanting to have the uncomfortable conversation that he needs to have to make this situation better for everyone. NTA Op.", "This. His strategy was to placate his family with empty promises until they just give up and accept Jenny the way she wants to be accepted. A new version of \"fake it till you make it\", I guess. And now he's pissed because that blew up in his face.\n\nOP is NTA; it's on Nico for not having handled the situation earlier.", "I would\u2019ve been frustrated to in Op\u2019s position but I do feel bad for Jenny. She\u2019s been annoying, not malicious, and I think that comment will stay with her for a long time.", "This is really well said. I feel for everybody in this situation.", "I disagree, Jenny has crossed way too many lines at this point and op's response while undeniably harsh, was also justified. She overrides and ignores the wishes of every one around her, makes people uncomfortable and continues even when those people ask her to stop. The gentle approach has not worked, she needed the reality check. She can\u2019t just invite herself along to things, start calling her in-laws mom and dad even when they've expressed it makes them uncomfortable, try and talk about her sex life with op when they've expressed it makes them uncomfortable, and expect no consequences and everyone to pander to her just because her childhood sucked. NTA.", " Edit: OP actually *did* say something similar to what I said below, so props on that. It sounds like she got frustrated and said the harshest version of what everyone was thinking, but it's not the \"is it understandable that I got frustrated\" sub, it's \"am I the asshole\", so still ESH.        \n     \nAgreed on all of this. Personally, I think OP could have said something about how being part of a family doesn't mean being invited to every single family activity, which is true; while I wasn't in foster care, my husband's family has very much become more of a family to me than my blood-related parents because of how they treat me, but that doesn't mean I have to be invited to Every Single Thing my MIL does by herself or with my SIL because Family.", "What else should OP have said?", "The same way you build a friendship. You start with casual conversation, you find some common ground, and you build it like a Lego. Frankly, Jenny has friends, she should know how to do that. \n\nFor example, the second time I met Jenny she said I should feel comfortable telling her about my sex life because \u201csisters tell each other that stuff\u201d\u2026like\u2026no? I just met you. Honestly it\u2019s likely not something I\u2019ll ever share with her because I don\u2019t want her reciprocating given she has sex with my *brother* but again, second time I\u2019ve ever seen her. She\u2019s not my \u201csister\u201d.", "We have humoured her. We\u2019ve humoured her for two years, but since the engagement it\u2019s gone into overdrive. It was embarrassing for my parents to get messages from their cousins and second cousins who they see once every five years asking who Jenny was because she was sending them Facebook messages. It\u2019s hard to not be able to have any conversation with a family member where she can see you because she has to know the details of what you\u2019re talking about. I\u2019m sorry, but I don\u2019t think Jenny needs to know about my sex life, just because I\u2019m telling Chelsea. It\u2019s not the same. \n\nAgain, I understand she\u2019s not used to the dynamics but at the same time, she has friends. She built those relationships why can\u2019t she build these ones?", "She is in family pictures, but sometimes my parents want pictures of just me, Nico, and Chelsea, and she insists on being in them, even when our other partners aren\u2019t. She\u2019s not not in any pictures, she\u2019s just not in all the pictures. \n\nNo, no one is upset about her background.", "Nico is really close to my mom. \n\nWe don\u2019t have disputes near people, and they\u2019re not big arguments. We bicker. Me and my mom will be bickering about something irrelevant in the kitchen, Jenny will come in, demand to know what\u2019s going on, and try to mediate. Like, even if it were Chelsea doing that I\u2019d be like, this has nothing to do with you. Or Jenny will hear about some random (again small) issue Chelsea is having with our parents and start texting our parents and Chelsea her thoughts on the argument\u2026why? \n\nWe *want* a relationship with her, but we just want to build it over time, and we try to do that. But if it\u2019s not instant Brady Bunch she doesn\u2019t want it.", "Thank you!! Its norma to throw a shower for your brother. They are obviously around a ton. OP just sounds jealous to me.", "You hit the nail on the head. I think that\u2019s what bothers me the most about OPs take on this-she\u2019s acting like Jenny is an entitled AH. Jenny isn\u2019t an Ah, she just doesn\u2019t know how to forge family relationships. and she IS family, as soon as they are officially married it\u2019s real. she desperately wants family. she might be annoying and doing it wrong, but she\u2019s not a monster.  I think OP acted like an ass/mean girl, but OP is also not an asshole, if that makes sense.", "No. We offered to talk to her, but Nico didn\u2019t want us to.", "Yep, my thoughts exactly.", "I get that she\u2019s going to be family, but I don\u2019t have intimate relationships with all my family either. And even the ones I do, they don\u2019t insert themselves into my life or relationships. Nico is my family, but if I\u2019m arguing with my mother, I don\u2019t expect that he will come in and try to mediate, because family or not that has nothing to do with him, whereas Jenny will come in and decide she needs to know all the details of what we\u2019re arguing about and start giving unsolicited opinions. That\u2019s not really the kind of family we are. \n\nNo, none of our other partners call our parents mom and dad and in our area/culture that\u2019s very unusual. I know from friends I have who come from different cultures that it\u2019s more common but to us it isn\u2019t. And common or not, my parents have asked her many times not to do that. \n\nNico isn\u2019t the black sheep, Chelsea and I are just very close to each other. Nico is very close to my mom and as close to his dad as the rest of us are. And no one dislikes Jenny, we\u2019re just uncomfortable with some of her actions. \n\nI have a great relationship with Chelsea\u2019s boyfriend, he\u2019s like an extra brother to me, but that developed over a period of time. He didn\u2019t come to one dinner and then think we were literally siblings. Similarly, I\u2019m close to my boyfriend\u2019s sister, but again, it happened organically, and gradually. We built a foundation for a friendship. Jenny isn\u2019t interested in that. If she\u2019s not like bio family today it doesn\u2019t have value to her. Or at least, that\u2019s how she presents it. \n\nAt the end of the day, I feel it\u2019s a compromise, and thus far she hasn\u2019t really compromised, she\u2019s just pushed.", "Sounds like Jenny doesn't take no for an answer, I wouldn't be surprised if it wasn\u2019t a question, and she just said \"and you'll be my maid of honor\". She's no respecting boundaries which makes Jenny an undeniable ah. She calls her in-laws mom and dad even though they said it makes them uncomfortable, and just steamrolls everyone else's emotions because she thinks her sense of belonging is more important than anyone else's comfort which makes her an automatic ah", "I don't perceive OP's family as unwelcoming. It's also really weird you are giving yourself a compliment and saying you would definitely be welcoming. It's like \"nice guys\" saying they're nice.\n\nIf someone you know but have not built a relationship with is asking you to be MOH, dont you think that's odd?", "I agree. She sounds like she is eager to find a family. However, growing up in foster care, she didn't learn much about dynamics. Calling your parents Mom & Dad-What's wrong with that? I mean, unless she started doing that the 2nd time she met them, this is something that happens with in laws. I wouldn't be surprised if: once they have their own family she & Nico don't see your family much because of y'all's rejections (and there are many). OR she breaks up with Nico.\n\nMOH is a role that can be politely declined. I hope you didn't tell her your real reasons. They've been together for 2 years. When  is your family going to quit gatekeeping the family and let her in? Yes, she is overly eager. Maybe you should chat with her, apologize, and ask if she can move more slowly.", "The parents asked her many times not to call them Mom and Dad, how is that not trying to slow her down?", "She insert herself in family disputes that don't concern her, she reached out to family they aren't in contact anymore, she keeps inviting herself to stuff. At some point, someone needed to tell her to stop doing that. And her coming from foster care is not an excuse for being intrusive and not respecting people's privacy", "Would you say the same thing if it was a stepmother who wanted to force a mother/daughter relationship because she couldn't have children of her own?", "How is reaching out to my parents\u2019 second cousins who they haven\u2019t spoken to in five years and messaging them on Facebook not unreasonable? How is telling my mother to throw her a bridal shower while my mom is helping out her dying BIL already not unreasonable? Like\u2026", "Both my parents have asked her many many times politely not to call them that, she stops for the duration of that meeting and starts doing it again the next. It\u2019s the same with asking probing personal questions, be that about my sex life, my therapy, my medication.", "[deleted]", "I feel like if my parents want one picture of their three kids, that should be allowed. It\u2019s not like she\u2019s not in any pictures, but why can\u2019t we just have one with the three of us? \n\nNo, she demanded the bridal shower. She asked, my mom said no because she has work commitments and her BIL is sick so she is going back and forth helping out her sister, and Jenny just said \u201cbut you have to. I don\u2019t have a mom to do it so you have to\u201d. \n\nI get that it\u2019s normal some places, but it\u2019s not to us. And again, they\u2019ve asked her to stop several times. \n\nShe\u2019s announcing her engagement to people my parents haven\u2019t talked to in years. My parents got calls from their second cousins asking why Jenny was messaging them in Facebook. How is that not invasive?", "It\u2019s not fair to say we haven\u2019t tried. We have. We are trying to establish a genuine relationship with her but if it\u2019s not instant she doesn\u2019t want it.", "She is a grown woman who went to school, works and socialised with friends. She bloody well understands boundaries. She just doesn't want any when it comes to the family she is marrying into. And her partner did little to help his family or his fiance to build a bridge. OP is not at fault here. A grown woman with no respect and a weak willed man are the two most at fault.", "But that\u2019s the point. She isn\u2019t trying to *make* anything. She arrived and just thought she can take what\u2019s already there. I *want* a relationship with her, I have a great relationship with my boyfriend\u2019s sister for example, but we built that over time. I didn\u2019t arrive at her house, say \u201chey sis, tell me your darkest secrets\u201d. The second time I met Jenny she told me I should tell her intimate things about my sex life because we\u2019re \u201csisters\u201d. She\u2019d been dating Nico for three months and I\u2019d only ever seen her twice.

We have zero evidence nor have we been told that, why would you assume?", "Maybe I should put this is in an edit because I thought it was obvious but apparently not - we do try to tell her. I have told her many times \u201cJenny I\u2019m really not comfortable discussing my sex life/ therapy/ medication etc. it\u2019s personal, can we just change the subject\u201d. Just like my parents have asked her many times not to call them mom and dad. She stops for the duration of that meeting and just starts again next time.", "Not that we have ever been told.", "The problem is that it's clear that Jenny wasn't responding to subtle.", "Nothing. Jenny wasn\u2019t gonna stop until she got her way or got checked.", "I am with you. I HATE people like this who have no boundaries.\n\n\nAlso, having a traumatic past does NOT give you an excuse to behave like this. As a fully functional adult and a member of a society, you have the responsibility to deal with your shit for YOUR SAKE.", "Yikes", "Woof. That\u2019s rough.", "Sounds like the people who try to force kids to call the new stepmom \"mom\" right away. Never ends well. I'm extremely introverted, among other things. I do not warm up to people quickly and keep most at arm's reach (or farther, lol). I can count the number of people I truly consider friends on one hand. But those people are as much my family as my biological one.\n\nI can understand not wanting to be the MOH. Is there something you have in common that you could, very carefully, use to get to know her  and let her get to know you? I don't think you said anything but the truth, but it did hurt her feelings. I'm not about to say you *should* apologize, but it's the kind of situation to consider one. \n\nHow do you balance your need to get to know her and her overarching *need* for the family ties you have always had? I have, well, not really ideas. Notions, maybe? Make plans for lunch? Neutral ground? Strict time limit unless you BOTH agree to extend it? Picnic? An afternoon at a museum or zoo or something you both find interesting? Having something neutral in front of you to talk about might take some of the edge off. I dunno, I'm just spitballing to see if anything sticks.\n\nIf her heart is in the right place and your brother can get her to understand she's been pushing too hard, maybe you can start over. Bro really needs to step up and have that very difficult conversation. That part is his responsibility, not yours. Good luck!", "What would you like the game plan going forward? I get the reaction if that is how she is out of the gate but it sounds like there is some trauma surrounding her actions. She isn\u2019t reacting rationally. NTA on your part, \n\nAlso, I would hope you see your brothers part in this if he never brought your concerns to Jenny. Was this the first time she was hearing that she is too much and too pushy? It might be good for you and your family to set the boundaries with her and not use your brother as a go between since he may not be conveying your concerns and boundaries to her. I think it would just be sucky if the situation was left like this.", "kinda going against the grain here, but growing up in foster care and without a \u201creal\u201d family sucks ass. having a *family* versus having *friends* is a totally different level of love that jenny has never had. imagine if you\u2019d gone your whole life without that type of unconditional support and love, then one day you think you might finally have a chance at that. i probably would\u2019ve been a bit much if i were her, too. i\u2019m not saying that she wasn\u2019t going a little overboard, i\u2019m just saying that i think some more empathy is due. what you said stung her and it\u2019s going to stay with her, especially if she was a foster kid.", "But saying \"no, I just met you\" at that early stage would have had a better outcome with less sting.\nAlso how did she \"make\" you her MoH and why is that a bad thing?   \nNTA btw, you had no other options at thay stage", "Yeah it sounds like your brother *really* needs to talk to her about boundaries. It seems like her problems are more social than familial. Jumping in on someone\u2019s conversation like that is never cool, regardless of how related you are to the people.", "So you have known her for two years, she\u2019s engaged to your brother, yet you still want to exclude her from photos and the regular things you do with family? What happens when she gets married? Is she still not considered family until you decide it?", "OK I feel for both,  but this statement of its embarrassing for my parents to get messages from cousins asking which Jenny is, that's just bullshit, there is NOTHING to get embarrassed about if she was inviting extended family, are they so pathetic they can't ask themselves?\n\nI get you frustrated but it also seems you are really set in your ways and Jenny better learn to let things happen the way we want them to, so everyone here is the asshole, I don't give a damn how frustrated people are you were being unnecessarily harsh, yoy and your family need to getba reality check as well, yoy are not royalty that should expect things only their way.\n\nESH", "This isn\u2019t an odd request.. my husbands family takes pictures like this all the time. One with just the adult kids and ones with their SO. It would be absolutely bizarre if anyone ever insisted on being in every photo", "All that needs to be said is- next pic we will take one with you and the kids.", "It sounds like you aren\u2019t engaged to the \u201cother partners\u201d. There is a difference.", "Have any of u talked about this issue with her beforehand?", "> We *want* a relationship with her\n\nLol you absolutely don\u2019t, but go off queen", "Probably because he knew you'd be an asshole about it like you were here.", "I think you need to take the time to explain this to her. Apologise for your comment because I don't think you wanted to make her feel that way. It was in the heat of the moment and lacked the nuance the situation deserved. You need to have an honest sit down about this, talk about your feelings and how it makes you feel. She may react badly at first due to rejection and embarrassment but if she is worth having a relationship with then you guys will be able to navigate this moving forward, like adults.\n\nWith regards to the butting into arguments, Jenny may have often had to play mediator growing up and thinks that is how to handle situations in every family. Tell her that it's not that you don't want HER opinion, but that it isn't how arguments are handled in your family. You don't want her to involve herself the same way you wouldn't want Nico to. \n\nTalk about the time thing. She may have observed all of these close relationships between your family and partners but explain how it wasn't instant. If you can, add specific examples of when you started to specifically include them in outings, hang out or communicate outside of their connection to your sibling, it may help her understand a more appropriate timeline. Let her know that her pushing has stalled a more genuine connection forming on your end but you would like to let one develop.

Being a part of a family is something you learn to navigate as a child, and even then families can be tricky. She never learned this so she's trying to find her place in the family by force. However, she is going to have to learn one way or another. Maybe you were a bit harsh and I suggest you learn a different approach in terms of dealing with her, but ultimately everyone has an emotional bandwidth when it comes to boundary breakers so I can understand why you said what you said.\n\nWhen you lay down a boundary, the boundary breaker will look for opportunities to test it and break it. It sounds like you and your family try to enforce a boundary *sometimes* and other times you make exceptions. This is highly confusing to a person who doesn't understand boundaries. There has to be consistency. If you meant what you said, don't apologize or backtrack. In the future, be more precise with what you mean without taking a dig at her.\n\nExample: \"hey Jenny, we're taking a photo with just us siblings, we'll bring you in for the next one.\" If she said something like \"but I'm married to your brother and technically a sibling\", you can say \"this one is just for us, but we'll definitely do another one with you\". \n\n\"Hey Jenny, I'm planning this trip with just my mom and sister. I'd be down to do something separate with you tho. Maybe we can do a day trip to the beach\". If she says \"but I should be included in the girls trip.

Either way, Jenny needs to see a professional to help her work through everything.", "NTA but what you said was really mean and unnecessary, and the fact that the entire family was even agreeing with what you have said to her, I can say that Definitely you ruined your relationship with your brother forever.\nYou know that unfortunately she didn't have a family and that situation could have been handled in 1000 different and better ways.\nIf any person in my family would say something like that to my partner, I would never see them again, no matter the apologies, the lack of compassion is really bad.", "NTA. Your brother chose to ignore the concers of your whole family time and time again. This was bound to happen.", "NTA. Jenny is the asshole in this instance of course, but this is really your brother\u2019s fault. I can understand how somebody who grew up without a family might not understand family dynamics, but he should\u2019ve grabbed the bull by the horns after the first time she overstepped. I\u2019ll bet he\u2019s never even broached the topic with her, because it was easier in the moment to just put it off. And now it\u2019s too late, because if he brings that topic up two years into the relationship she\u2019ll think he\u2019s a major asshole for not bringing it up sooner (and rightly so).", "OP is NTA HERE, but she definitely needs to apologise for the way she talked to jenny. Ofcourse they don't own her a family but she also don't deserve to be constantly reminded that she is from a foster care system. Since the brother is the AH and just wouldn't man up, I think it's time the parents and OP talk to Jenny about the boundaries, if she really is a good person she will understand.", "This falls on Nico to deal with.  The only major issue is that she doesn't know what a family dynamic works and doesn't understand that the relationship that was built within a family is over many, many years. Although both are a united front (Nico and Fiance) Nico's family is his family and when it comes to family planning, it's Nico that is the middleman and he is the one that should bring up her joining.\n\nFamily doesn't always do things together. siblings and parents do things in smaller groups or one on one and talk about it. This is what is missing. Your brother doesn't understand this because he sees it like when he was growing up and it's just second nature to him. \n\nI think it's time to have a talk directly with him and help him understand that his inaction is what is causing all of these issues. He needs to understand that when he sees his SO do something, he needs to see it from if he was with her family, how would he react, would he interject himself into the convo or self-invite? or would he let it be and understand that it's not his place?\n\nWe as siblings that grew up with each other, we can be direct and sometimes rude to each other but we know that we all love each other and just making a point about a specific situation. She on the other hand has never had that kind of interaction so I feel bad that she is getting thrown into the lion's den without a lion tamer to help protect her by telling her when not to poke a sleeping lion.\n\nNTA - In reality, she is getting how a family acts together when someone is out of line. But in her special situation, it's best to use explanations and make sure your brother is in the room when you explain these things as he might now see exactly how she acts and what triggers she might be pulling. It's a way for your brother to see first hand what he needs to work on with her.", "Nico is TA", "I've never had anybody have a problem with me calling them mom or pop. Maybe one guy with pop.

I\u2019d be upset if my mil took her daughter and other dil on a trip and left me out. \nFeels like you and Jenny need to have a really good heart to heart, forget Nico he\u2019s not done his job, set your boundaries with her and tell her you\u2019ll try to include her more as a way to give and take.", "Yeah he really dropped the ball with this.

NTA OP", "This and more importantly, what is Nico saying to her?\n\nI'm wondering if in trying not to hurt her or be the bad guy he's just not saying anything or did he promise her an instant family?", "I understand OP's (and her family's) frustration with the situation - I would definitely feel frustrated to in their situation. However, I can't help feeling a little sorry for Jenny. She apparently wants to be part of a family so badly that she comes on way too strong and Nico, probably, doesn't want to crush her hopes by telling her to take it down a notch. Yes, her behaviour is not okay, but I find it hard to see them as assholes.\n\nOP, maybe if you and your family are open to it, you could have a serious conversation with Nico and Jenny about this, since Nico clearly isn't having it or isn't getting through to her. Explain how you/the family would love to get to know her better and want her to be part of the family, but that it takes time and that she can't insert herself into everything. That she's coming on too strong and it's having the opposite effect of what she wants. Tell her which topics/behaviours are off limits (sex life, calling your parents mom and dad, etc.) and suggest some low key things you could do together to get to know each other better (go for a coffee every once in a while, do something one on one with her if you're open to it, etc.). \n\nI understand your comment, but it was very harsh and I can see why that really hurt Jenny's feelings.

Calling future in laws mom and dad when they\u2019ve expressed discomfort with, ask someone about their sex life the second time meeting if extremely invasive and comfortable and assuming that you could just include yourself in everything makes me think she lacks self awareness.  Nico should have spoken to his fianc\u00e9 like he\u2019s promised and set boundaries.  He can\u2019t expect his family to continue to deal with the invasive behavior behavior and hope he\u2019d step in.  I think it just became too much, too overwhelming and OP expressed what everyone felt, albeit in a harsh way.  I\u2019d say NTA.", "This. If Jenny grew up in the foster system and never had a real family of her own, she most likely simply doesn't know any better. She didn't have the opportunity to learn the required social skills when she was younger, and now she's apparently desperate to be part of a family (can't say I blame her).\n\nAnd even if she's told, lifelong longing will be hard to overcome and will take time. \n\nNot saying that I don't understand OP because I do. But I feel for Jenny.", "I agree that it's either NAH or ESH. Not sure which because everyone involved could have handled it better. Things came to an ugly head because no one prevented it from coming to an ugly head.\n\nJenny doesn't understand family dynamics and interpersonal boundaries because she's never experienced those things. She's probably seen families on tv and movies and thought those depictions were normal and that was the ideal that she too wanted to have.\n\nWhy she would insist on calling her fiances parents Mom and Dad when they expressly asked her not to, I can't understand. Though I also can't understand parents telling their kid's fiancee \"Don't call us that.\" Especially having grown up in foster care, she likely called a lot of parental figures Mom and Dad, and to her, that's just what you call parental figures.\n\nJenny's probably used to trauma bonding with whoever is around her in a familial situation. Quick, deep bonds formed from shared experience. She may not be able to comprehend a different way of gradually forming family bonds. Not without really heavy guidance, at least.\n\nEveryone involved should have dealt with this sooner, before a history of bad feelings began to accumulate. It's hard to develop a good relationship once a bad one has already taken root.\n\nNow, the family might end up losing Nico because Jenny and his family are setting him up to have to make a choice between them. \n\nIt didn't have to be this way. If there's still a chance to change things and be gentler with one another, everyone should try really hard to do so. This is how enduring rifts begin.", ">I think my final vote is going to be ESH; Jenny for being pushy, Nico for not warning her that her pushing wasn't going unnoticed, and you for saying something really wounding.\n\nNowhere did OP say what you've decided is fact below -\n\n>Nico for not warning her that her pushing wasn't going unnoticed", "She apparently has friends. The problem is she wants OP to be her sister and the MOH thing was part of her pushing that.", "By actually building a relationship through respect for boundaries, genuine interest in similar things, reciprocal communication that doesn't make someone uncomfortable, and taking time to let things happen casually. You have to literally *make and build* an intimate bond. Both parties have to share mutual affection and agree on the nature of the relationship. You can't just walk up and announce that you're someone's family. You have to develop it, and it has to be reciprocated. I have people in my life who behave like this SIL. I can promise you that when you have been raised with really healthy boundaries, it is extremely upsetting and violating to have someone just force themselves on you and demand a bunch of affection that takes years to develop. It's creepy.", "A lot of the examples gives feel like something normal. Maybe it's cultural but where i live calling in laws Mom and Dad is expected.", "I agree with a lot of what you said. But I think the difference here is that SIL isn't responding when people try to teach her. When her ILs say, \"Please don't call us Mom and Dad. We're uncomfortable\" she needs to stop. When OP says that she wants to spend time alone with her sister, she needs to respect that. She might not know how to do this well, but she does know to be respectful when people tell her they have a boundary. That's where people are getting entitlement from. Struggling to do something well doesn't entitle you to force folks to pretend you did it.", "But if you call someone mom and dad, they correct you and say stop, you STOP. Continuing isn\u2019t naive - it\u2019s not respecting boundaries.   Period.", "NAH. Thank you for this!  All the people calling Jenny an asshole have no idea how traumatic her life has been, she has no idea how to build healthy relationships or what healthy boundaries look like.  Not saying it's all on OP to deal with this, but instead of looking for absolution as being the wronged party she should be looking for ways to find a solution to this situation since this woman is joining her family whether she likes it or not.", "This is a good point, it\u2019s not that she\u2019s entitled necessarily but doesn\u2019t have the skills of developing closeness with family", "I couldn\u2019t put my finger on what was bothering me about the post but I think this is it. I understand OPs frustration but the lack of compassion in communication is astounding.\n\nMy MIL and I have different life stories that led to me being weary of ILs and her wanting a close relationship with her DILs. We don\u2019t hold this against one another though. She knows that by no fault of her own it will take a long time for me to get to know and trust her intimately and she\u2019s expressed why it\u2019s so important to her that we have a good relationship. Occasionally, she might push me to hangout a bit much for my comfort, but because I know where her needs are coming from I\u2019m able to meet them with kind and understanding boundaries. \n\nGetting to know ILs is super hard already, even when you have your own family. New family dynamics that you don\u2019t fully understand and certainly don\u2019t understand the backstory on. You both know this one human in different but very intimate ways. It\u2019s like when you meet your best friend\u2019s other best friend. But this aspect is really on Nico in my opinion. He failed to protect Jenny from this dynamic that she didn\u2019t understand and didn\u2019t know was as big of a problem as it was. \n\nThis was a very low blow to someone who grew up like Jenny and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a justifiable one just because OP was frustrated. By many peoples logic, Jenny and Nico also don\u2019t owe his family \u201ca family\u201d either. I think those words are going to ring in Jenny\u2019s head for a long time to come, regardless of what apology she is given. Whether that leads to a break up or just their future nuclear family being more distant from OPs family, who knows.", "A better analogy given her background in foster care is probably that Jenny doesn\u2019t *have* dancing shoes and has never seen anyone dance, but desperately wanted to participate in it anyway.", "Nico not talking to his partner is the reason they\u2019re in this mess in the first place.", "If that's the case, go with ESH as it seems like all need to loosen TF up. \u2661", "My mom is helping care for her dying BIL, she really doesn\u2019t have time.\n\nI wasn\u2019t offended she asked, I was offended she bombarded me for a week when I said no until I sent her my six month diary to \u201cprove\u201d I didn\u2019t have time.", "Read some of ops responses. There was no effort just the immediate expectation that they would have a sisterly relationship. Jenny pushed and ignored boundaries that they were trying to set. I get that she had a shitty childhood but that\u2019s not an excuse to step over people and make them feel uncomfortable. Op doesn\u2019t think they can be considered sisters yet because there isn\u2019t an existing foundation for their relationship that has been mutually established and maintained.\n\nOp wants to take their time building the foundation. Build it brick by brick. Jenny wants to rush it and slap some cement on it call it done.

We don't see eye to eye on anything politically, socially et al and that's also ok.

She\u2019s definitely trying, she\u2019s just getting it wrong. It sounds like they haven\u2019t been trying and she\u2019s responded by trying harder.

When someone says I'm uncomfortable with this, I wouldn't like to be called this, etc. etc. you don't just bulldoze those boundaries.\n\nOPs parents have told her that they don't like her calling them Mom and Dad but she continues to do so. That's not just not understanding how families function, that's just being disrespectful. For *some* reason SIL thinks that because they're a family she can just ignore them when they say, \"I don't like this.\" It's not that she hasn't been taught familial boundaries, it's that she's explicitly disregarding them even when they make it known to her.", "While I do agree with therapy, I also understand that unfortunately not all therapists are trauma competent when it comes to foster care and adoption.\n\nI\u2019m an adoptee and had to intentionally seek out a therapist that has specialized in adoption therapy.

So they stop letting themselves feel like they have a permanent place.\n\nJenny likely views her relationship with Nico as the first permanent family relationship she's ever had.

Now it's blown up and is out in the open - which, ironically, happens in a lot of families, so Jenny got that part of her wish, at least.\n\nI agree that an apology makes sense, especially since OP clearly feels bad about it. But as you say, it has to come with a serious discussion about boundaries and the building of relationships.\n\nSeriously, if any of my siblings' partners had come up to me at our second meeting and said, \"Hey, you can totally tell me about your sex life, you know?\", then I'd be putting some distance between us, too.", "Yeah this is my feelings too. I knew a girl in college who was a little older than the rest of us who behaved very like this.

It was super uncomfortable but I found she responded well to gentle turn-downs or redirections, and after a few months got easier to deal with. \n\nJenny has never had a family, she\u2019s never had sisters or a mom or anything and has likely spent her whole life fantasising about it and taking info from media about what family does and is like. Her behaviour isn\u2019t good and I don\u2019t blame OP or the family for being annoyed, but I think it\u2019s important to understand that you *will* be her family when they\u2019re married (so long as you want Nico in the family), you just need to establish what being step-in-laws (i think) is going to mean for you and how it\u2019s going to differ from her idea of it. \n\nOp and family have only really considered how her behaviour is annoying them and not where it\u2019s coming from and what she\u2019s been through *at all*, and it sounds like Nico has done the opposite, not wanting to upset Jenny without thinking about her behaviour and how that\u2019s affecting his family (and, inevitably, their view of her).

I may be a Reddit minority here because brutal honesty is the wrong way to go about creating change. The cruelty of those comments shows a lack of empathy and usually damages relationships - if you want to burn something down, that's the route to take. You can be direct and blunt without being mean.", "Agree with all the above. And also just to add, OP does mention '(step) siblings' specifically, twice, so this is already a blended family through marriage. To someone like Jenny who already doesn't have any experience of a real and loving family, I can understand how this might be an extra step in confusing boundaries. It could just look to Jenny like, 'look, they're not even related by blood either, they're just step siblings, but they love each other and treat each other like real family.' She's obviously not understood that their relationships are built up over many years, but I can see how looking in from the outside Jenny might've assumed she'd fit in easier than she has in a family she's not related to by blood.", "I fully agree. Nico and Jenny have been together for 2 years. It kind of seems to me that the family has been annoyed from the get go and maybe Jenny feels she has to insert herself because no one is giving her the chance to build a relationship with them. That comment was hurtful and I think an actual conversation/apology is the way to go here. Invite Jenny along for lunch or coffee here and there, give her the chance to build relationships with the family.

They're not supposed to allow all her intrusiveness just because she didn't have a family, everything has a limit. \n\nHer husband had the opportunity to tell her to be it down also but did nothing. You're making it seem like they're villains for being fed up on their privacy being intruded just because someone has a sad/traumatic life doesn't mean you should allow them to do what ever they want to you.", "The empathetic thing was to talk to Nico and have him say these things to her. OP and family tried that, and Nico didn\u2019t follow through. OP mentions that they themselves have repeatedly tried to establish a boundary with Jenny during the conversations where Jenny is crossing the line. OP states that the family has offered to sit down and have this discussion with Jenny themselves, what would\u2019ve been an empathetic, measured,and gentle establishment of boundaries because they could think about how they\u2019d deliver their message. Nico refused this as well. \n\nI don\u2019t think that people are AH when they\u2019ve tried all other avenues and are still having their needs dismissed and boundaries ignored consistently. \u2018She comes from foster care\u2019 isn\u2019t a reason not to set boundaries, in fact within your family is where you\u2019re supposed to learn how to set and respect boundaries and the family would be performing their duty to Jenny in setting them. Sometimes people need a wake up call to see what\u2019s going on around them, this one is Jenny\u2019s. Nico could\u2019ve avoided this and now he has to explain to Jenny that his family has resented her overstepping for a long time and she didn\u2019t know about it because he\u2019s a wuss.

You can't just start declaring someone is your mum.", "I can't believe it took me this long to find someone else who found this off-putting.  \n\nThe family seems very closed off to Jenny and the mom/dad thing is weird.  It's completely normal for long time partners to call their partner's parents mom/dad - even if they aren't married.  I'd love to know what all the other partners call them.  Do they all call them mom/dad?\n\nI've dealt with large close families like this and they can be very closed off and cliqueish to \"newcomers\".  It definitely sounds like that's what's going on here.", "I'm guessing it was a cherry in top situation.

If my brother gets married i wont expect to be the maid of honour or even a bridesmaid unless i am actually friends with the girl. It sounds like Jenny saw some hallmark movies where the husbands sister automatically gets included as a bridesmaid because .. family? Like its weird that she has no close friend who would want to plan the bachelorette events for her and instead wants someone who she is arguably not close to to do it. Nowadays i also see sisters being in the \"groomsmen\" party because they are sister of the groom.

MoH is usually your best friend or your sister, but it's always someone you're really close to so asking your sister in law who you actually don't know well is strange.

It\u2019s not normal but not creepy or unheard of", "I feel like being asked to be a bridesmaid is one thing, but I do think that being asked to be MOH is too much. That should be reserved for someone you're really close to - it's asking someone to dedicate months of their time to The You Show, it's a lot of work and commitment. That makes me wonder why Jenny doesn't have anyone in her life that she feels comfortable asking to be MOH. Huge red flag.", "MOH is supposed to be given to the person you\u2019re closest with, even if not a family member then an extremely close friend. I understand Jenny doesn\u2019t have any family but does she also not have a single friend?

If you don\u2019t have someone that fits that bill it\u2019s perfectly fine to just not have one and have only bridesmaids.", "Um... Yes? Of course it's weird! No matter what Jenny wants so badly, the truth is, OP doesn't have the relationship with her that would make her being asked to be MOH the natural choice. Jenny is putting pressure on OP and forcing an intimate friendship where one doesn't exist, and for OP to accept would be to display a level of closeness that doesn't exist. It's an uncomfortable situation and I don't blame OP for feeling like an arsehole, but Jenny has forced her to be the bad guy.", "Yeah, I have far less pity for Jenny than others ITT do. Obviously she can't understand the dynamics of a family having never had a stable home situation in her childhood.

Sometimes people need to hear a harsh truth so that they can finally back off. OP and her family have told her multiple times that she's overstepping and she ignored them.

This statement sounds like OP putting her foot down once and for all, and I honestly can't blame her for doing that when Jenny refuses to listen to her.", "She has told her off more gently before, but it clearly wasn't working. Sometimes harshness is necessary, especially when a person is aware that they're overstepping your boundaries and don't care enough to stop. In this instance I fail to see how OP telling the truth makes her an AH, considering Jenny is aware that her behaviour isn't welcome and has been told as much by OP and her parents. Maybe now she'll finally get the message.", "But isn\u2019t there a middle ground between subtle and stab you in the heart mean?", "That doesn\u2019t make what someone said not AH-ish. A regular adult would have a full conversation with her about it. \u201cHey, I know you really love our family and we appreciate that. We want to get to know you and have you be a part of our family, but we need time to grow and foster that sort of close relationship. We aren\u2019t comfortable speaking about intimate/private details and need you to please stop asking about them unless we offer that information. I know this might feel like rejection, but please understand it isn\u2019t, we just need to hit the brakes a bit so can you please follow our lead from now on with personal conversations?\u201d \n\nShe\u2019s was a foster kid and it\u2019s normal to assume that she didn\u2019t receive the best examples of boundaries and a reasonable person who grew up in a healthy household should be able to realize what she\u2019s lacking. She\u2019s not a kid, but she\u2019s an adult who lacked many of the very important building blocks we learn as kids to ensure we are good adults. You can say you\u2019re empathetic and such as much as you\u2019d like, but reasons should be given and POVs explained. It\u2019s likely her idea of a happy family or relationship with in laws comes from media and therefore she\u2019s trying to replicate that. It would be so easy to just have a real conversation about it with her, not simply a passing comment whenever she brings its up. And people asking her partner if they can talk to her is so fucking weird man. Just be an adult, and calmly approach the topic. There\u2019s no taking it well when you really like and want to be close to people and they shut you down, but I\u2019d say she did pretty well by just keeping to herself to feel her emotions and not taking it out on everyone. \n\nOP is allowed to have a reaction and so is FSIL. And they should accept that it might change their relationship with their brother if they are getting married. You can\u2019t reject someone\u2019s friendship and then expect their life partner to remain just as close with you. Just like you can\u2019t expect to have a close friendship with your in laws. It seems like they want to remain very close with brother and still keep his future wife at arms length and I just don\u2019t see that as reasonable. \n\nBut this was honestly just a rant so take everything I said with a grain of salt. Because if you\u2019re biggest qualm with your future in law is that they want to be your friend too much, sign me up. I just definitely think this is ESH.", "I\u2019m not sure if jumping to family therapy is the answer. I think she needs individual therapy.

The same way my husband doesn\u2019t get in touch with my uncle that we are NC with. \n\nShe just went and contacted these people, possibly inviting them to wedding stuff when it\u2019s likely OP\u2019s family didn\u2019t want them there as they had little contact. \nShe\u2019s overstepping big time.\n\nNTA, OP. The irony is Jenny trying so hard is what is making it difficult for her to become part of your family. If she was more chilled and took a step back it\u2019s likely the relationship she wants would have evolved over time naturally.", ">OK I feel for both, but this statement of its embarrassing for my parents to get messages from cousins asking which Jenny is, that's just bullshit, there is NOTHING to get embarrassed about if she was inviting extended family, are they so pathetic they can't ask themselves?\n\nI disagree, it is weird as hell... Maybe not embarrassing but weird. \n\nIt also may be the cultural issue / difference, but I honestly can't imagine myself reaching out for my partner's cousins, aunts, uncles etc like \"hey, I am your relative's new fianc\u00e9, you don't know me, but now as we are almost family I want to invite you to our wedding\". \n\nIt's not how it's done, it's really strange to go find these people on your own. A good way to meet them would be if Nico introduced Jenny to everyone on a family event/meeting or some other way, like videocall or so. The same with invitations - why is she doing it alone? Not as a couple. Or why  not Nico texting - it's his relatives... If I were one of these relatives I would be at least puzzled and yeah, I would call parents to ask who is she, because it's strange to receive such messages if you don't know that this person even exists and her fianc\u00e9 haven't said a word... \n\nI have a feeling that the girl got too excited and doesn't know what is considered to be appropriate and what's not...\n\nAll in all I would say she is not a bad person and didn't do anything too wrong but she may be super hard to handle... Especially if the family is more of a closed type where members generally are not too intrusive and respect boundaries.", "Yeah. Yeah it is too soon to talk about my sex life. How is that not a choice I get to make? How come it\u2019s wrong for me to decide who knows what medication I\u2019m on?", "And that's her right the hell \n\nWho just openly talks to people about their sex life family or not, seems like you'd allow anyone to steamroll you", "Yeah, they seem to also be the type of people who can dish it out but can't take it. The \"brutally honest\" people who complain that everyone else is rude to them because they are \"so sensitive.\" The only real thing they are is brutal and like a bull in a china shop when it comes to boundaries and other people's feelings or preferences.", "She needs people to strongly assert boundaries with her so she learns to behave appropriately and develop the ability to form strong bonds. \n\nIt's not kind or empathic to allow her to steamroll over everybody with her fantasies because the nicer and more indulgent people are, the further she will push until eventually, everybody has to cut her out for their own sanity.", "There is literally no excuse for attempting to initiate a conversation about OPs sex life ever.  While empathy is always important when dealing with humans, Jenny went way past \u201ca little overboard.\u201d  Having trauma does\nNot give you the right to cross other people\u2019s boundaries.  Consent is always important.  Jenny wants empathy but doesn\u2019t give it as she violates healthy boundaries for her own gain.", "OP comments above that *on their 2nd meeting*  Jenny tried to discuss OP's sex life \"because that's what sisters do\". She told her no, they don't.\n\n Apparently parents and OP have tried to gently dissuade this behavior and it was too subtle.. or Jenny is just a boundary pusher and won't back off until situation becomes nuclear.", "She didn\u2019t force me to do it. She asked me and I said no and she was super insistent about it and mad when I wouldn\u2019t do it.", "She asked me, I said no, citing other commitments. She got mad, then upset, then mad again. It was a text and call onslaught for about a week before I literally gave her my itinerary for the next six months to prove I was not able to do it, then she finally left it alone.", "You're acting like they speak in code around Jenny so she doesn't get it\n\nJenny is shoving pash boundaries!!", "To be fair, just for the sake of analogy, dancers who step on others' toes don't do so intentionally. That's why stepping on toes during dancing is associated with a lack of skill, and not associated with malice.", ">how is she supposed to know?\n\nBecause they've told her before. Not all their grievances at once, but have told their boundaries whenever she did something they weren't okay with. i.e. OPs parents have told her that they're not okay with her calling them Mom and Dad, but she continues to do so. Even if she doesn't know how families work she could just *listen when they tell her no* like you would do in any other relationship. \n\nShe's made friends, and she probably wouldn't have any if she stomped over their boundaries like she does OPs family, so she assumedly knows how to respect people and is just not doing that for whatever reason. She shouldn't really need any explanation not to do something when someone asks her *not to do something*", "Because when you\u2019re having an issue with someone\u2019s partner, you normally talk to the relative before you talk to them. You don\u2019t call up someone\u2019s girlfriend and be like \u201cwe need to have a talk with you\u201d without telling their partner?", "The moment Nico and Jenny got engaged, he pushed the responsibility onto himself.", "I get what you\u2019re saying, and I\u2019ve been in therapy for five years, I\u2019m not ignorant to how trauma responses can work. But does Jenny at no point have to also give something? We want to support her but I\u2019m not sure that has to/ should mean we always have to put aside our own boundaries to triage her trauma.", "trying to blame this on trauma make it sound like your implying the presence of trauma gives adults permission to completely ignore social cues and lash out whenever someone tried to redirect them. she is entirely out of line. i had a similar upbringing as her and have plenty of friends who grew up in the same situation, yet all of us have managed to fair just fine at developing healthy familial relationships with people we meet later in life. giving her an excuse to act like a literal toddler when it comes to her interactions with people who are allowed to express healthy boundaries isn\u2019t cool.", "That's a little unfair.  I agree that her behaviour is likely to be a result of childhood trauma, but most people are not trauma informed and would have no idea how to handle this level of intrusion into their personal lives.  \n\nTrauma can explain the behaviour, but it does not excuse it.  It appears that the family has tried to set boundaries, and Jenny has repeatedly ignored them.    You appear to be implying that the family are at fault for refusing to accept behaviour that clearly makes them uncomfortable.  \n\nWhat would you suggest they do?  Fulfil Jenny's needs at the expense of their own?  No reputable therapist would sanction that.", "Just because something is not within your personal experience doesn't make it \"weird\". There are literally BILLIONS of people in the world who are not you, whom you do not know, and whose experiences and cultural practices differ from yours.  Billions. Your entire circle of friends and acquaintances AT MOST probably numbers in the couple-of-hundred, if that, and it's unlikely that you even know what most of your casual acquaintances call their in-laws. \n\nFor the record, my dad called my mum's parents \"Mum and Dad\" because his own parents weren't particularly nice, and he was incredibly close with his in-laws and felt really loved by them. I know LOTS of people who call their in-laws \"Mum and Dad\" for similar reasons. In many cultures it's not uncommon at all.", "IMO, it depends if the other in laws call them Mom & Dad", "this is some really nice advice, i hope OP reads it. It's time for open but gentle communication, if Nico won't do it, someone else will have to.", "OP is not being harsh. OP is asking for basic boundaries, which is normal, even among blood relations and romantic partners. OP TRIED to be 'gentle' and 'kind' by speaking to her brother, and requesting that he speak to Jenny about boundaries. He didn't. The issue persisted. And now it's reached a breaking point.   \n\n\nThis has nothing to do with misogyny, as you imply with the comments about Jenny being the partner of the 'only son'. And it doesn't seem like OP even personally dislikes Jenny on a personal level, as you also implied. OP just wants some personal boundaries to be respected, which is NOT UNFAIR. Jenny inserts herself into conversations and arguments that she is not involved in. OP can't even talk to her sister or mother about anything ACROSS A ROOM because Jenny will come over and insert herself into the discussion. That is RUDE! If the OP says she doesn't want to talk about her sex life with Jenny, that's totally fair and not exclusionary, just because she is comfortable speaking to her sister about that. Everyone has their own personal boundaries regarding what they are comfortable with, and family or not, it's important that they are respected. Do YOU share everything with your siblings' partner? Do you tell them everything and jump into their conversations when you see them talking to someone else? Do you want them to get involved in your disagreements with your parent that they don't even know the entire context of?   \n\n\nIt doesn't matter if Jenny is her brother's partner, or the mother of his children, should they have any. That doesn't entitle her to overstepping OP's boundaries.", "This is bad advice.", "Jenny issues are not their's to fix, yes can make her part of their family but what Jenny wants is unrealistic no family is that enmeshed in each other and if their are its a very unhealthy family.   \n\nEven within families their are boundaries.   \n\nWhen 2 siblings are fighting doesn't mean ever other siblings start fighting as well.    \n\nWhen disputes are happening everyone doesn't  need to get involved and give their 2 cents worth.", "Hopping onto this to also say that if and when OP has the conversation with Jenny, it needs to be supportive but firm and talk about real boundaries to keep with the rest of the family. \u201cJenny, we are tired of asking for you to stop calling Bob and Marla your parents.\u201d \u201cJenny, as much as I want a relationship with you I will never want to talk about my sex life or my medications with my siblings. That\u2019s not something siblings discuss.\u201d \n\nYou need to put it in the larger context of \u201cthat\u2019s not how things actually work in the real world.\u201d", "Not all foster kids do, and not all kids recieve or recall skills that way, especially kids dealing with continuing trauma. Saying this to her could backfire.", "Exactly, it is not all lost for Jenny to have a good relationship with her in laws.", "I\u2019m sticking with NTA since I think the blame lands on Nico. If it where NAH there\u2019s really no fault and I think Nico has caused this issue.", "I came to the same conclusion.", "Exactly.  I think what\u2019s at the crux of the issue is that Jenny has assumed that extended family is supposed to function like immediate family. And that\u2019s not how it works. Now Jenny can get that close relationship. But it takes time and organic growth and also not talking about your sex life to the literal siblings of your partner. \n\n But Jenny doesn\u2019t know that. And should have been told that by Nico. Maybe another option is OP could ask if they look into family counseling. Essentially a safe environment for them to all have this discussion. And maybe a sneaky way for a professional to suggest Jenny do some individual therapy. But that\u2019s kind of underhanded to push for therapy hoping for a specific outcome so maybe not the right choice. \n\nWhat I do know is Op is NTA and ultimately I don\u2019t think Jenny is really either since she hasn\u2019t been given the conversation on boundaries and she wouldn\u2019t know better. I think Nico is the problem here.", "People are way too in favour of brutal honesty on here sometimes, but to be constantly speaking that way to your loved ones is cruel and doesn\u2019t help or change or accomplish anything except damaging your relationships. There\u2019s times people need some harsh truths, but that time isn\u2019t when a woman who has been through a lot and is about to marry your brother is well meaning but coming on too strong. That\u2019s a great way to ruin your relationship with said brother forever if you\u2019re not careful.", "I agree. Too bad the family can\u2019t bend a bit to include Jenny. She\u2019s supposed to fit into a particular role they have for her.", "Or people are in their right to not like it?", "This is what I read from that also.", "That actually makes sense. If she hasn't seen how a family functions or been involved in real life weddings, the movies would be her closest reference point to what she should expect. Which sets her up for spectacular failure.", "And truthfully Jenny and the family where only out here because Nico refused to say anything leading up to this point. It sucks. But Nico put Jenny in this situation by not having the uncomfortable conversation and clearly Jenny wasn\u2019t picking up on the subtle. So what was the family supposed to do? We all hit a breaking point at some juncture. OP\u2019s came now.", ">sometimes harshness is necessary \n\nI think it\u2019s really giving OP the benefit of the doubt while simultaneously assuming the worst of Jenny, which is a pretty biased assessment if you ask me. OP never tried to be less gentle yet not harsh, so of course there\u2019s no way to know how she reacted. Just because you relate to the feeling or something doesn\u2019t make it not an AH thing to do. YTA.", "In this case, I think whether or not OP is an ahole or not is really dependent upon all of the other interactions they have had over the course of them knowing her. OP was harsh but that harshness could have been completely justified or not. There's clearly a lot going on here and Jenny has some attachment issues, however, just because Jenny has things to work on doesn't mean OP is in the right to tell her off in the way she did. It's very hard to place this on the ahole spectrum without actually seeing their relationship and knowing more about them.", "I feel like this would have been Nico talking to her.\n\nEdit: to clear up confusion, my judgment is ESH, but mostly Nico. I do think OP went nuclear immediately and shouldn't have. But I also think she thought Nico was taking care of it when he clearly was avoiding having the difficult conversation with his own partner.", "I think for people raised in a normal supportive family environment, yes, there is a good middle ground between too subtle and \"stab you in the heart\" (love that btw). But it's pretty clear that Jenny doesn't get it. \n\nWe give our daughters such bifurcated messages - Be Strong! Don't take crap! No means No! and also.... \"Couldn't you be nicer? Be Sweet! Don't be mean!\". I mean, what is it? which one? Sigh. OP is young, I'll give her the benefit of that, and as a quiet private person myself, I sympathize with being fed up when your hints and pushbacks just don't work and needing to just get LOUD and stand your ground. \n\nSome people just keep riding roughshod over allll the subtle polite hints.", "I get this.  \n\nI've been with my fiance for 3 years.  Engaged for 1.  When photos happen I wait to be called on when people are gathered.  I'm not in the family yet, even though I basically am.  They treat me like a son and even call me their son.  I've spend the past 3 years building a relationship with them by visiting them, cooking for them, bringing them gifts and including them in my life.  However I don't know what kind of pictures they want so I try to be respectful and listen to their wants.", "The more context I get from your comments, the more I wonder if this is tied to the way she grew up. If you think about it, foster care sort of forces kids to join a family overnight. It would make sense if the siblings she's used to being around were always expected to just jump right to accepting her, accommodating her and calling her a family member. Maybe she hasn't figured out that that wasn't exactly a normal family, either. I really feel for you and your parents, OP. I have some people like this in my life, too, but they're not my family so I got to just cut them off. I wonder if there's a way for you guys to just... keep stuff from her? I know that's shady but maybe it would be a plan B for if she just won't stop? She can't invite herself to something she doesn't know you're planning. She can't jump into sister selfies that aren't in front of her. It seems to me she needs a strict info diet for a while so that she can learn how to work her way up to the intimacy she's creepily demanding.", "Well, at least you won't have to worry about her showing up to family events anymore.", "I agree, I wonder if anyone has suggested this as an option to Nico.  His response was to go LC, which is the exact opposite of what Jenny wants.", "It may not be ideal, but I noticed that you mentioned you are in therapy yourself.  Could you maybe ask your therapist for advice?", "Why is it nuts? It's similar to couples therapy.   The therapist acts as a mediator", "It is her wedding she can invite who she wants no? The Parents are embarrassed because they have said nothing about her and now they will look bad that's all this is", "i don't really understand this person's take because you don't have to feel open and comfortable talking about everything with everyone because it's your information to share as you see fit, if at all...\n\nmeaningful bonds do not have to be formed solely through gossip and secrets or whatever - oftentimes, it's through quality time or adventures or shared interests \n\nyou're nta for wanting to keep these things to yourself and you'll never be! people are entitled to their own privacy, autonomy, and choices about their lives and it's odd that people are disagreeing about that\n\nyou may, however, be ta for hurting her feelings like that but even then, this all could've been avoided by nico just talking to her in a more effective way. maybe you guys should have a family meeting with her where you can have a firm but loving conversation about boundaries so she can see where the disconnect is without feeling attacked or hated. good luck, op x", "I never said it wasn't her right, nice straw man though.\n\nI openly talk about anything with anyone because I can handle socializing with other beings, without feeling the need to be private over matters I find inconsequential - like my medication for my depression and my amazing sex life with my wife.\n\nSorry you are uncomfortable over conversations regarding sex and mental health. It's 2023, get over it.", "Lol I agree.  my sister and I are very close and if the subject is leading up to my bedroom life she will yell out \"I don't want to know.\"  She's known my husband since she was 11 and she sees him like a big brother.", "Same. I have a sister and our relationship is such that we'll happily talk about our emotional problems or medical issues, but at no point do I want to hear about her sex life or share details of my own. \n\n\nJenny seems to have a bit of a skewed idea of what the average siblings share.", "Yep, I've known both my sisters in law for nearly 30 years, & would never discuss sex lives with either of them", "Yeah I don't want to talk about anyone's sex life, no matter how close I am to them. It's just not something I feel comfortable discussing.", "yeah, \"reading the room\" on how a family behaves isn't something you are born with. You were taught that your family doesn't do that. \n\nShe probably grew up wanting to share these things with some family and believes it's normal. And it actually is, to some families.", "To be fair, not everyone can \u201cread the room\u201d since many conditions (which go undiagnosed) make social cues impossible.

They are also all up in your business and use it against you later. Just pathetic kinds of people. They need to stop making these kinds of people.", "I think that\u2019s on Ops brother.

My heart goes out to her though because it doesn\u2019t seem like their was ever malice in her actions.", "i think that there\u2019s a difference between strongly asserting boundaries versus being somewhat cruel, especially in the context of dealing with someone who has early childhood trauma (like foster care). personally, i feel that it\u2019s unfair to expect the same relationship-building strategies and tact from a person who has not experienced early childhood trauma versus someone that has. i mean, it\u2019s not even just my opinion, there\u2019s a wealth of literature and research that supports the fact that early childhood trauma inevitably impacts your long-term ability to connect with others and can negatively affect physical health outcomes, too. i never said that jenny is in the right, nor did i say that OP was in the wrong, but i do think OP and her family need to do some research on trauma to better understand why jenny acts the way she does when it comes to the concept of \u201cfamily,\u201d and hopefully speak to her with more empathy.", "Wrong. She has been thrown away by everyone in her life so far. The comfort of everyone around her has always been prioritized above her feelings. That's why her concept of family is so idealistic and childlike. She had no experience or wisdom of family dynamics to mature her imaginings. \n\nWhat she NEEDS to heal is to feel safe and secure in her relationships. Obviously healing her is not OPs responsibility, but being cruel and ignorant only works against her. Unless SIL completely shuts down...I wonder OP, was that the goal? To retraumatize her into submission? Shutting down is her only other option given her (lack of) experience.", "People also have to think about the future. If Jenny and Nico have kids, she will also be super invasive and boundary stomping with them too, unless someone puts her in check now. What's going to happen is she'll want to be deeply involved in her children's lives, to the point of smothering them. She will be invasive and domineering with her children and their privacy to the point that they will also push her away. She will become \"that mother-in-law\" when her children start dating. This needs to be nipped in the bud NOW.", "Good thing OP and her parents are neither nice nor indulgent then? Just cuz they\u2019re right doesn\u2019t mean OP had to be cruel about it.

Jenny was being annoying, not evil", "While being raised in foster care is an obvious reason for this behaviour, as a neurodiverse person I'm wondering if Jenny may be neurodiverse?\n\nShe doesn't seem to be picking up on social cues and inserts herself into conversations and events. She seems to follow a perceived idea of how something should be (a \"rule\" of what sisters are like) rather than considering the nuances of the situation.\n\nShe seems like she's being unintentionally intense and invasive.\n\nThese jumped out at me as possible indicators of ASD and/or ADHD. u/fsinlaw, do you think that may be at play here?\n\nThat said, while neurodiversity may be a reason for behaviour, it doesn't excuse it or require that OP accepts things as they are. However I thought it could help shape a conversation with Jenny to set boundries and expectations in order to reach a compromise.", "And Jenny got mad about the refusal.

I do believe what OP said will stick with her. Anything that someone says that\u2019s harsh is not easily forgotten. A lot of people don\u2019t know the effects foster care has on children growing up. We have no idea what her experience in foster care was like either. For me, I was adopted with my 2 siblings by my first and only foster family so I don\u2019t have experience myself with how toxic it is.\n\n\nMy older sister, who was adopted a year after us, went home through home and been abused. She lost her baby sister, I think she was about 7, due to the family adopting the two since they were a packaged deal and after the adoption went through they put her back in the system. She been sexually abused by a foster dad before and lived in group homes where it was common for girls to prostitute themselves for drugs. \n\nSo depending on the environment Jenny grew up in, talking about sex early on wouldn\u2019t seem like a issue especially if it\u2019s normal for foster kids to talk about. Attachment issues are another thing so it would make sense if she got attached quickly to the family especially with getting engaged. \n\n\nShe been dating Nico for two years so it\u2019s possible the family didn\u2019t set boundaries early on so she may not be aware since they allowed her to act a certain way for a long time. I don\u2019t see why Jenny can\u2019t call the parents mom or dad. Maybe because in high school all my friends would call each other parents mom and dad.

First impressions are everything, and because of her brother reluctantance to have his family do one on one talks with Jenny they're in this mess", "NTA - with a butt.\n\nNormally, the way you de-escalate an argument with someone who's mentally unstable is to focus on the here and now, on the matter at hand, and refuse to follow them in their deflections towards their trauma, which they understandably will quote and use as framework, because they are drawn to relive their emotional state from their trauma and interpret their surroundings according to the trauma.\n\n**Please consider the unfair imbalance between yourself and someone whose trauma is an open wound, common knowledge and exposed for anyone to poke at. That is extremely uncomfortable and vulnerable. Even stable survivors who have built a strong character on top of a traumatic event carry shame, guilt and fear from past trauma, and especially so when said trauma originates in child abuse and/or abandonment.**\n\nYour knowledge and understanding of her trauma is not a means to put her down. I do believe that was never your intent, but the thing with notorious open wounds is that it's always KINDA THERE. It's like she has a creepy Dementor following her around, and you can't separate her from her Dementor yourself, because it's always there for you to see.\n\nUnderstanding where she comes from, however, doesn't mean letting that ghost define who she is in relation to you, nor should it be the sole prism through which you see her actions.\n\n**When you said that marrying your brother didn't grant her access to the family, that's in essence what she heard. That's not exactly what you said btw, but that's what the discussion became about and you let the discussion be about that.** She doesn't have the tools to identify her triggers and disengage herself, so she reciprocated in kind and escalated.\n\nHowever, I want you to consider that conversely, you have no control over her joining your family, if your brother decides to marry her. The conversation about joining the family was therefore moot. She asked for inclusion based on marital status, you argued for her exclusion by dismissing that parameter. **You BOTH put your brother on the spot and their relationship in question, you were BOTH mistaken.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n***Next, you have to accept her.*** I disagree with you there, you MUST accept her. You brother chose her, and it's not looking as if they'll break up soon -- although that altercation will have strained their relationship, not doubt.\n\nYou have to stop expecting your brother to address these things after the fact, and yet, when you do address them on the spot, you should not drag the whole context together with the point you're driving. Most importantly, do not frame it as US AGAINST YOU, with your brother being the triangulated pivot. The reason why your logic pivots on your brother, is BECAUSE you haven't accepted her.\n\nAre you sure, deep down, that you do not have reservations against her BECAUSE she doesn't have a family ?\n\nThere lies your opportunity to built a teensy bond with her. Apologize for telling her she's not owed a connection (because the connection will be inevitable, but don't say it like that), tell her you wanting to go somewhere with SOME of your family members was not about pushing her away from the family, **and that you understand that you were the one who triggered her, that you were wrong (you were), that people don't have to work to deserve love and acceptance, that that was mistaken and hurtful.**\n\n**Your family gave you** ***unconditional*** **love and acceptance, and when you tell a traumatized child that** ***they have to work to deserve love and affection when all the effort in the world could not have prevented them from being abandoned in the first place*****, not only is it cruel but it goes against your purpose : you are in fact reinforcing her maladaptive thought patterns, and telling her all her efforts weren't enough, that she'll never be enough. You're creating cognitive dissonance in her, and that's on you. That's what your brother meant by setting her back.**\n\nI say NTA because you gave a strong rebuke, and she pushed on anyway. She doesn't know when to let go, and she went straight for the self-victimization and the emotional blackmail. That's not OK. But you have to understand that **you triggered her by referencing her trauma and putting into question the legitimacy of her bond with your brother.**\n\nI hope your brother is understanding, and understanding means he has to ground her and offer her the security she needs, on his own. It'll be a terrible let down for her if the engagement is ever called off.\n\nMy opinion is this : **the common ground you and your maybe future SIL share is your common belief in a fair world.** You are securely attached to the notion, while she is emotionally challenged by the same. When you reference fairness and logic (you have to build a relationship brick by brick and deserve a connection), she hears trauma (maybe if I reach this milestone then I'll finally be enough). Whilst she mistakenly sees your brother as a stepping stone, you mistakenly present her a mirrored image of her beliefs in order to invalidate her.

The fundamental relationships she had - her parents - were ripped apart from her.\n\nShe seems needy because she is needy - there is a basic and fundamental need for attachment that has been stolen from her.  That is not an excuse for her to skip over social norms, but she very likely just does not have the social skills to pick up on those social queues.  \n\nNico sucks for not working better to facilitate the relationships.\n\nYou suck for throwing her lack of family back in her face.\n\nMy suggestion is that, if you have it in you, read up on foster care and what it does to people.  You have an opportunity to be what is likely Jenny's first real and true friend, but it's going to take effort.

She is your family, not some person who\u2019s started squatting in your home. This is why in laws get such a bad reputation- stuff like this.

It\u2019s really weird and hurtful considering her past that they insist she not call them mom and dad.  It\u2019s like unnessecarily hurtful.  The lesson to learn here is that you can\u2019t hurt and push away a man\u2019s fianc\u00e9 and expect things to stay the same with you relationally.  She\u2019s probably annoying.  You should have learned to deal with it.  She wanted a big, open, whole hearted relationship with you.  You guys said nah.  She may never speak to you again.  Good luck with  trying to see your brother in the future.", "ESH. I think your family are a bunch of jerks. Why can't Jenny call your parents Mom and Dad?

Why can't you be her MOH, since she has no siblings? Etc. Etc.  \n\nJenny came on strong, but you guys are REALLY SUPER determined to keep her out.

Congratulations on creating newer, stronger trauma for your sister-in-law which, btw, is family no matter how much you want to deny it since the very moment Nico and her got married. She was pushy and should have respected boundaries, that doesn't give you the right to nuke your relationship with her (And everybody else for that matter) in one swoop.

It's not what you said, it's how you said it that makes you the asshole.", "I don\u2019t know. It feels like you guys see her in a different light because of her being in foster care. You say you guys generally have good relationships with partners that come in the family but it seems as though you guys are being a bit tough or distant with her. \n\nI know if I were her i would definitely feel left out and sad. \n\nI understand that she doesn\u2019t need to be insistent and pushy about things that make other people uncomfortable, but maybe boundaries need to be set. \n\nI do not see an issue with her wanting to be in the family picture\u2026 that sounds like a petty thing to be upset about. In my family on both sides we treat the in-laws as they are family and are allowed to be in family pictures. I was in family pictures when me and my BF were dating in HS. While I am included and he is included in family pictures, we also take picture of the parents with their husbands and kids alone. No in laws, no aunties, no cousins nothing. \n\nFamily disputes things your brother should definitely tell her to keep her thoughts to her self. I am married. When there is a family dispute on either side my husband and I discuss things in between each other and who ever family it is that is the person involved who speaks out. You need to talk to your brother about that and set a firm boundary.\n\nIt sounds like she had trouble reading the room. \n\nMaybe you can have a conversation with her saying hey I don\u2019t want you to feel uncomfortable but I would love get you know better. I do however have boundaries on topics of discussion. \n\nOr something of that sort,", "If I was OP I would call Jenny and ask her out for coffee.

It sounds like she\u2019s too much work for you guys and you just want to stay away from her.  And that\u2019s okay.  But realize that she and your brother are a unit now.  If you exclude her, you exclude him.  You have to learn how to deal with having an in law you don\u2019t get along with.  We all have them.  You\u2019ve got to be tolerant, respectful, and keep stuff to yourself.  If your family starts ganging up on her, you\u2019re gonna hurt her.  And all of that pain is going go hurt your brother too.

Hell, my kids could bring home a casual friend who didn\u2019t have a mom and they would be part of the family. This family is so cold.

It doesn't sound like her intent was malicious whereas yours was. You knew what you said was a low blow. \n\nAlso, how long have you and your step family been blended? Could it be it took time for you each to feel and act like family?", "YTA here.  This is kind of the way significant others of siblings work.  You accept them as family until you have a reason not to.  I don't love everything about my siblings spouses, but you better believe they are included in everything possible.  They tend to say no quite often, especially as they're acclimating to our family dynamic, but they are always invited.", "YTA the poor girl grew up without a family, finally found one with her partner, she even wanted you to be her moh, now you\u2019ve gone and made her feel even more unloveable. she was annoying not malicious, you could\u2019ve approached this in a more compassionate manner.", "Soft YTA because you guys never had a true sit down conversation with Jenny and explained to her that familial relationships are built and that the way she's going about getting them is actually pushing them away. She's an adult. She could probably handle it. Instead what she got was some one off comments she probably thought just meant in that moment and then a really harsh comment seemingly out of nowhere that basically told her you guys don't want her as family. \n\nAnd yes, I am giving her a little bit of a pass because she probably really doesn't know how families work or how family is built and with Nico not saying anything and more than likely reassuring her that you guys like her, it's entirely possible she didn't know. \n\nThis shouldn't have been something you guys left up to Nico. If you saw he wasn't speaking with her, you guys should've spoken to her directly. His trying to protect her and you guys trying to be polite instead of being direct is why this situation is occuring now. I'd even argue ESH. \n\nI'd sit down with Jenny and explain where you guys are coming from because it seems like you STILL haven't done that.", "I'm going to say ESH, leaning towards YTA because it seems like there's more reason to it on her side.  \n\n\nIt's quite normal to include a spouse / fianc\u00e9 as part of the family, like being included in family pictures and family wide social events for example, and seems like you guys are intentionally excluding her from that. Yes relationships take time to build but two years has given you time to do that and you aren't going to build a relationship by excluding her whenever you can. Maybe she came on a bit strong, and I guess her history explains why, but I'm not convinced there isn't at least as much blame on both sides of this one and your assumption that it all needs to be down to Nico speaking to her, and her updating her behaviour, rather than you as a family being more welcoming is probably part of the issue.", "YTA. Her requests are reasonable", "So hang on...a nice lady with no other family wants to be a loving member of your family, but because family relationships were never modelled for her she doesn't know how and now she's been rejected by the only family she thought she would ever have and so her fiance is trying to defend and support her? And you think they're in the wrong?\n\nYTA and so is your whole family.", "You and your brother suck. She needs to learn boundaries but she IS trying to build a relationship, she just doesn\u2019t know how to do it how you want her to. I do understand how awkwArd and frustrating it would be for someone to elbow their way into a relationship, I probably would have snapped, too, but I\u2019d still be the ah if I did", "Yea, going against the grain here. YTA, biiiiig time. This isn't some brand new relationship, she's been around for over two years now and is engaged to your family.

Sure it may have been awkward at first as most people don't form those connections overnight but it's been two entire years. At what point have you known her long enough to love her?\n\nThere are some people in my family I don't care for. That doesn't mean I don't welcome them with open arms and love them anyways. It's just personality quirks, you're not dealing with anything malevolent here.", "YTA deffinently. You have known this person for 2 years and you still treat her like she's a stranger to your family. It's to the point where she is actually marrying your brother! She has pushed every avenue to try to build a connection with you which you consistently reject so your statement about how she hasnt earned it doesnt make sense. You are a bully and it's hard to believe that your whole family is \"on your side\" . Sounds like a fib.  What does she have to do? Give you gifts and kiss your feet? She can invite anyone she wants to HER wedding. If you don't like her, that's ok but making it out like the whole family doesn't like her and doesnt consider her as member of the family is narcissistic. You're weird.", "Esh\u2026\u2026honestly, that was harsh. All this girl probably ever wanted was a family that loves her and as your future sister-in-law. Sure, she may have pushed the boundaries but no one ever told her about boundaries with family. While she may have overstepped, I don\u2019t think she is the a hole here. You, your brother and mom/ dad\u2026. In my opinion- kinda TA here. Your brother being the biggest AH. This woman is family now and you need to accept her and teach her the proper ropes to navigate your family unit.", "YTA\n\nIt seems like she doesn't understand where the boundaries are because she didn't have a family, so she doesn't have a lifetime of knowing where the lines are. It's entirely possible that what you interpret as \"entitled\" is simply her acting on her understanding of how family works from TV/Movies. \n\nSet your boundaries, of course, but you can do it kindly. And you definitely need to apologize to her.", "YTA - you\u2019re pretty blatantly hostile to a new member of the family.", "Yes, you're quite insensitive and rude. You're 100% the A here. Shame.", "YTA- this is a vulnerable person who has gone through trauma. kindness and patience are free.", "I\u2019m probably going to get downvoted but, YTA. So is Nico, but you say you understand how excited she is to have a family, but do you?  You are coming at this with tools she apparently doesn\u2019t have. It makes sense to the rest of us that these relationships need to build over time, but maybe you should consider that she will learn these things over time and continue to cut her some slack.  Yes it\u2019s awkward to be maid of honor and throw a bridal shower for someone you just met, but how much worse is it to be someone who doesn\u2019t have anyone to do those things?  You could have welcomed her with open arms and, while understanding she\u2019s not your BFF, treated her like someone who likely is going to be part of your family forever and showed her some grace.", "Well if he's anything like my brother \"I'll talk to her\" is his code for -I'll never mention it and hope everyone else gets over it-\n\nShe's coming in too hot, someone has to cool her approach before she burns everyone out.

Why would you feel off put when she asked you to be her maid of honour? That\u2019s a huge compliment. Why wouldn\u2019t you invite her on family trips when Nico is making her a part of the Family?

Even still, that doesn't give her a free ticket to grossly overstep boundaries and make things uncomfortable.

He'd rather let this rift between the two of you grow ever wider.\n\nNTA, but I think it's really time you and your parents sit them down - Nico and Jenny, and explain that Jenny's actions are hurting her chances to build a true bond with your family, and that this needs to change. Don't sweep this under the rug; all parties will only end up miserable otherwise.", "I think her lack of having a family of her own means she doesn't know how to act when presented with one through her fiancee and it's unfortunately rubbing people up the wrong way.\n\nI wouldn't say you're an asshole, but I would encourage you to spend more time with her and allow her the opportunity to become closer to your family.\n\nI think your brother didn't speak to her at all despite being given opportunity to do so on more than one occasion, and the behaviour hasn't been addressed so this isn't her fault. She's only responsible for being wanting to be accepted, loved and to belong, and at its core - don't we all?", "YTA\n\nI'm editing my original post from the far more brutal tone I had before. And while I better understand where you're coming from, at the end of the day your reaction in this particular scenario was cruel. There were far better ways to voice that building frustration", "Seriously, why can\u2019t you just be kind? Maybe she oversteps occasionally because she never had a family before, all of this is new and kind of wonderful to her, probably what she dreamed of her entire life.  The \u201cMom\u201d and \u201cDad\u201d thing made me want to cry. And wonder why your parents could not just be kind and let her, finally, for the first time in her life, call someone that. She IS family now, or will be if you don\u2019t drive Nico away.\n\nYou say she hasn\u2019t \u201cearned\u201d it, like there are some prerequisites that she must jump through before you are willing to treat her like family. What have you done to meet those prerequisites? How hard have you tried to get to know her? It was pretty shitty to be planning a family trip in front of her and then tell her to her face she wasn\u2019t family and wasn\u2019t welcome.\n\nYTA. Try harder.", "I'm not going to judge here, but rather give a little advice: I read your edit especially what you really meant. Maybe you should sit down with Jenny and explain it to her exactly that way. Because what you said to her didn't give that away.", "YTA, there are so many other ways to have phrased that comment but hitting her with YOU HAVE NO FAMILY AND YOU DONT DESERVE THIS ONE was exactly what not to say. Put yourself in her shoes. Avocate for yourselves, let her know where the boundries are. The poor girl doesn\u2019t even know. I feel for her. She is looking to be accepted and for the unconditional love she never had and you just confirmed that she is not either.", "100% YTA. Just because you had to earn your way into your step family and do due diligence, she should too? Sounds like spite more than concern to me.", "YTA and so is your family.", "YTA. When in doubt, be kind. Maybe she is feeling excited about finally having a family, and being that for her could help her feel less anxious in her attachment style, instead of repeatedly being cruel. Keep holding boundaries when needed, but no need to engage in low blows or say things that will wound her. You are the one who has a loving family; good to be the one to take the high road.", "Good God what a long post. So  I'll give the long answer. You do realize that few will read such a long post. People have very, very shot attention spans. Most people really don't care about your life story. Your future SIL needs help to learn how to be family. You need to take out your understand and set some boundaries and help her learn what it mean to have a family. Foster kids are needy because they never had their needs met or had boundaries set. MOST families are dysfunctional. Sorry, you sound selfish, makes you the asshole. Past foster kid.", "YTA.  Family should be shared.  Just because it wasn\u2019t easy for you right away doesn\u2019t make it ok to gate-keep.

Welp, you ARE about to be the reason Nico doesn't talk with your family.", "YTA\n\nI get where you are coming from, but your phrasing was very hurtful. She needs to learn boundaries and build up a relationship, and she's struggling with that. The harder she tries to insert herself, the more resistant you are to her. Yes, she's family, but you aren't close yet and she needs to understand these things take time and effort. Respect is earned, not forced upon.\n\nTalk to her directly and explain these things. It's obvious your brother isn't doing a good enough job himself and it doesn't look like she's going away anytime soon. It'll be uncomfortable, but she needs to know.

So now you have the consequences of that.  \n\nYou and your family are cold people and it's clear you don't want Jenny around. Nico has some responsibility here, but not all of it.  What you did was so unkind.  You've done some damage here.", "YTA. It's called communication, and you don't have to be insensitive and cruel to achieve it.", "YTA, that was a rude and cruel thing to say.", "YTA - if you think you won't lose Nico over this, you are wrong. You have a new family member,  that is what marriage means. Besides wanting to be involved, there isn't a single mean thing Jenny has done. You are really lucky for that. Nico chose her. He did not choose his family, and he could certainly abandon you all for your selfish behavior. It happens all the time. So the real question is if you want a relationship with Nico. If so, you're going to need to change YOUR behavior and get along with Jenny. You may not get the chance to now because of your severe rejection of her. Poor lady lives a life of misery and you just piled on some more. Shame on you.", "YTA, she is actually going to be family, unless you reject outright like you just did. You *really suck* actually.", "While boundaries are absolutely necessary, you could help shape her behavior and what being a family entails by leaning into it and being welcoming.

His boundaries are not great and he doesn\u2019t have any close friends, really, he doesn\u2019t have any real friends. It breaks my heart because while he does have a great family with me and my husband and his two younger sisters I worry about his future and if he will push people away. I worry that when he does make a friend he will come on too strong and push them away. Even when we have a pep talk before an event and we remind him it\u2019s really hard for him and he\u2019s not perfect. I guess I just can\u2019t help but wonder what he life has been like. People can be so nasty and I see it as she just has so much excitement and hope that her life is finally changing and that excitement of feeling like she belongs that she has trouble controlling it and just wants to jump in. \n\nHave you ever asked her uncomfortable questions like \u201cwhat was it like for you growing up in foster care?\u201d She may be triggered but it could also really help you understand her, from her perspective directly rather than hearing through your brother.

I have lots of brothers who are all now married and when you marry in, you are family. Some call my parents mom and dad, some don\u2019t.

The better course would have been to have a heart to heart with her in a calm moment, although I know that as tension builds it\u2019s hard to handle situations perfectly. But OP, what you said was pretty harsh, and it honestly will likely affect her. \n\nParental/caregiver love and security is *foundational* to our sense of selves as humans, and if Jenny didn\u2019t have that at points in her life, then she\u2019s struggling to overcome a big hurdle.

I can see she\u2019s too pushy about things, but also OP and her family sound cold and unwelcoming.", "There is a flaw in your reasoning. You are saying that someone defending themself sucks. Let me put it to you another way. Every time someone walks up to Jenny, she punches them, then defends her action by saying she doesn\u2019t know any better because she grew up in the foster system. So you rightfully ask her not to do that. But she keeps doing it. Every. Single. Time. Sometimes it\u2019s a hard punch, sometimes it\u2019s a light punch, but you always get punched if you talk to her. So you stop walking up to her, but she follows you and punches you anyway. What are you supposed to do at that point? Just keep letting this woman punch you? Or do you maybe finally punch back because you\u2019ve had enough? That\u2019s what Jenny is doing to the whole family, emotionally. \n\nI, personally, have learned to avoid the Jenny\u2019s of the world because I don\u2019t like being punched. I don\u2019t care how pathetic they are, they don\u2019t have the right to punch me. I grew up in an abusive household and I have trauma associated with that. It doesn\u2019t give me the right to vomit my trauma all over the place instead of learning to deal with it, like an adult.

I go to therapy and take medications and do the hard work.", "Lol, no. Inviting yourself to other ppls plans is not an attempt at building a relationship.

She\u2019s trying to browbeat them into making her family, and that\u2019s not okay.", "I agree with this. Families on TV are romanticized and remained. Kids in foster care or in rough families watch what a \"real\" family looks like. They see families come together for every moment. They see families support each other by being moh, having hard conversations, and being there for every moment. It's not always glorious with the door slamming, \"I hate you's,\" and grounding. But when the chips are down, the real love, even if it is tough love comes forward. People who grew up in foster care didn't experience that. That's what TV teaches you about family, and if you didn't have it growing up, you believe it is real.\n\nMy friend grew up in and out of foster care. It was brutal. She practically lived at my house to have a normal family. She craved it desperately. She didn't have healthy family boundaries and had to learn. She wanted what others had so bad. There were so many things she had to learn. \n\nNAH", "I wasn\u2019t mad that she asked.

She needs therapy asap", "Sounds like OP and OPs family has made many reasonable and normal attempts at having a normal gradual relationship with Jenny in the same way they have with other partners that have married into the family. It also sounds like Jenny bulldozes past those social norms each and every time and makes ppl extremely uncomfortable and ends up being annoying and not likeable. It sounds like OPs family has tried to have an accepting attitude about this while also getting Nico to have a talk with Jenny about boundaries and how to be slightly more appropriate in general but the issue has persisted to the point that Jenny has now put herself in a bad light. I don\u2019t understand how ppl like you skate right past all the boundary issues that have been stated like the whole \u201ctalk to me about your sex life\u201d shit (hell no you weirdo). OPs family have seemingly been patient and not been rude and have definitely taken Jenny\u2019s past, perspective, and emotions into consideration on multiple occasions where she has overstepped and they\u2019ve appropriately asked Nico in private to have a talk with her to resolve these issues without the family having to do something more confrontational. It just appears that Nico hasn\u2019t done that and Jenny hasn\u2019t gotten a clue. If I\u2019m in the kitchen making plans with my cousin my brother in law doesn\u2019t get to waltz in and invite himself and thankfully for me my brother in law is a normal guy and doesn\u2019t do this nor need to be told not to do this.

According to OP, he never had that conversation with her, though. \n\nThere is an AH here, and that is Nico for not speaking to Jenny about how she's trying way too hard, and it's pushing the rest of the family away. I do agree with your suggestion of one-on-one time with Jenny, though.", "That's on Nico, actually.

But when someone's trust in people is badly damaged, it's hard to believe that people might be more drawn to them if they do *less*. \n\nAll she sees is that she's doing *so much* and being rejected. She doesn't understand that the \"so much\" is actually the problem. She thinks it's effort that they should reward her for.\n\nI'm not sure it's something her fianc\u00e9 is equipped to help her change.", "> However, I can't help feeling a little sorry for Jenny. She apparently wants to be part of a family so badly that she comes on way too strong \n\nI do too. She definitely needs to respect boundaries, but I understand feeling left out. Like I know the future MIL isn't obligated to throw her a bridal shower, no one ever is, but given that she doesn't have her own family to do that for her, why not? (My mom and sister threw me one and then my MIL/husband's aunt threw me one in her hometown, where all her family is from, and it was really lovely and everyone was so excited for us). So I feel bad for her there. \n\nHer fiance definitely needs to have a real talk with her. But I feel sad for her. She needs to respect boundaries but it would also be nice if the family tried to get to know her a bit. Do their weekend trip without her but maybe arrange a lunch or dinner to spend time with her?\n\nBut I'm kind of a bleeding heart when it comes to this stuff since I lost my parents. Kind of feels like I lost most of my family/siblings aren't as close without that \"glue\" that held us together.

I'd  say N A H but Nico has created this situation by not stepping in and helping Jenny understand that his family needs time and that by becoming engaged she doesn't suddenly get the same \"perks\" that come with having always been a part of the family. I'm sure it would be a difficult conversation but Nico is 100% the AH for not doing it. He owes that to his family and Jenny.", "Right - saying NTA is saying Jenny is an asshole. I don\u2019t think she is. She\u2019s so eager for family - and that\u2019s kinda sad more than assholic.

Asking you to be the MoH without knowing you well makes that seem suspect.", "I wonder if Jenny is used to having to trauma dump. \n\nMy sister went to theater school for her undergraduate degree and one thing that became a big issue for her was the trauma dumping. My sister was raised in a family with healthy boundaries and initially was trying to fit into this group dynamic at school where whoever had the most trauma or the most \u201cfeelings\u201d was elevated a bit. For a few months my sister was insufferable.  Finally we all talked to her individually about how we wanted to not have her trauma dumping on us and it was like a lightbulb went off in her head. Suddenly she realized how uncomfortable she was and how crazy the currency of trauma was at her school. She ended up finding a group of friends who didn\u2019t trauma dump and they\u2019re all really close because they where the only people in her class not dumping on each other. \n\nI wonder if Jenny\u2019s blueprint for friends too is intense trauma bonding. Same with romantic partners (ie she and Nico are a bit enmeshed with eachother) \n\nSo if her roadmap is already unhealthy or requires a level of trauma bonding that could be a contributor to why she\u2019s not getting where she wants to be.

Some families are in each other's pockets all the time and others, no matter how much they love each other, are more casual about when they see reach other/message each other. Some people are huggy and others aren't. It all varies so much.\n\nJenny needs to find her place in how this family works, rather than trying to superimpose a storybook ideal over the top of it.", "Agreed with all of this.  And most therapy that foster care kids get, when they actually get it, is \"is this child's foster parents doing anything to be blamed for\" therapy.  The therapists employed by the state literally only care if the kids are showing a \\*current\\* problem, like signs of new abuse.  They don't sit them down and do talk therapy and teach them how to communicate or how to better process/handle their emotions, like real therapists will try to do.", "I wish I had an award for you because you hit the nail on the head. There's no free therapy or counseling available to *most* of the foster kids I've seen.  As a former nurse, the things I've seen have stuck with me through the years and it isn't pretty. I have seen more harm done in the name of religion and *family secrets* than should be ever allowed. They want to control every aspect of your life without ANY kind of support and that's just not feasible or sustainable.", "also to add...you're 100 percent right, if abortion bans were really about kids those same people would be DEMANDING that the CPS/Foster system be adequately staffed and funded and that there be more oversight. It's ludicrous to even pretend this country cares about children while we have kids sleeping in offices.", "THIS, thank you for sharing your experience. People tend to make blanket statements based on limited experience and that's just not the reality. Kids in foster care are getting the bare minimum for the most part and that doesn't include intensive therapy.", "yes! this. I grew up in foster care, they made me go to therapy - it was an awful and judgemental experience that also made me weary of going back. She may have gone to therapy while she was in foster care but we cant know her experience, if it hurt or helped her. \n\nThis whole situation sucks, I think Nico should be doing more to create a bridge that helps his fianc\u00e9 and his family come together. He should be helping his fianc\u00e9 in becoming close with his family.

One of my close friends went through the foster care system, and she DID have therapists- so many, in fact, that she ended up getting a court case specifically to stop mandating it for her because it just wasn't working. None of her therapists were willing to meet her on her level and got frustrated that a traumatized teenager was taking so long to open up to them that they would give up on her within months. The mental health field can have a lot of the same problems that social work does regarding coming in with big aspirations and the subsequent burnout, especially so when you're a mental health worker IN social work systems. I'm studying to be a therapist and I'm a huge proponent of mental health counseling, but it's still important to recognize its limitations.", "You make a really good point. Poor girl.

Ever since I left home, I LITERALLY would imprint on people I liked after one or two pleasant interactions. I would try to speed run through like 5 years of relationship building in 1 hour because I was already envisioning every way this could all end, so I need to make as many good memories as possible to get me through the next inevitable drought. \n\nI say this because I actually LEARNED something about what healthy bonds look like from reading your post. It actually made me feel better to hear such an insightful, understanding point of view from an outsider with a healthier mindset. \n\nIf this Jenny girl is anything like me, she\u2019s probably seeing marrying into a big family as a LEGIT dream come true. She likely ALREADY loves you, just by virtue of the fact that you haven\u2019t outright rejected her, and she\u2019s probably pestered your brother for enough family stories to get ready for meeting you. Her behavior, while absolutely unhealthy and needs to be worked out through professional help (might I recommend DBT), is probably coming from a place of legitimate excitement to get to know you all! This is a whole new world to her! Whole new possibilities! I know I\u2019d be making an ass of myself if I were in her shoes, and if it were me, I\u2019d probably be thinking that I\u2019d messed up enough that I\u2019d never have a shot in your lives again. \n\nI bet if you invite her out for coffee and told her all the things you\u2019ve written here, she\u2019d really appreciate a second chance with you all.

He married your mom, guess what that means automatic daughter, not I\u2019ll get to know her and see how it pans out. That\u2019s actually a really sad way of thinking.

Personally if I was Jenny I would have stopped trying with you people a long time ago. If anything I think THIS is the part where being a foster child is clouding her judgement. I have a bio family and we don\u2019t treat people like that, we welcome you right in until you give us a reason not to. I would never let someone treat my the way ya\u2019ll are treating her and still want to be around. It\u2019s weird.

Your brother is looking to start his own family (or so it seems) and that family will take precedence over a brother and sister relationship.

How is she supposed to know your expectations?", "NTA I suspect she talked about her wishes for a family and he said she\u2019d have it in you guys.

But I very much feel like the more the merrier and if she hasn't done anything bad (sorry but I dnt see her wanting to just be included and part of the family she is marrying into as bad) then she should be involved included etc. And I'm sure by stiff arming her it didn't help. I'm sure it's just a difference in how I was raised, see family, etc but I dnt think her just wanting to bond, spend time w ppl she will be family w etc was soooo out of bounds esp knowing how she was raised I feel y'all could have been a little more inclusive/courteous.

The people that is calling OP and the other in her family TA after having read the post, you might want to reflect on your own behavior towards your own family and friends.

I know you used terms like \"demanded,\" but honestly why didn't your mom or someone else \\*\\*offer\\*\\* to throw her a bridal shower? Is it possible that your family isn't nearly as warm and welcoming as you think?\n\nAlso, the sex question you mentioned in comments is super weird and invasive, but it also strikes me as odd that you left that out of her initial list of offenses and opted for \"she tried to force me to be part of her wedding party!\" instead. Kinda makes me doubt how objective you're being with this story, which is why I tend to think that you are more of the AH than Jenny, who missed out on really critical social-emotional development opportunities as a kid.", "Jenny sounds a lot like my brother\u2019s girlfriend.

His ex passed a few years back. And his current girlfriend moved to our city and she got really weird and almost clingy like she kept trying to force a relationship on me and that\u2019s not how I felt. I was barely close to my brother at this point. What really sealed the deal for me was her getting drunk and implying she knew how close the ex/baby mama and I were (she didn\u2019t) and that she didn\u2019t want me to think I was replacing her. I never thought that, and she never could. Bottom line relationships take time to build you can\u2019t force your want of a relationship on someone. That\u2019s how to get the opposite of what you actually want. NTA. You could have been nicer in the delivery sure but clearly being nice wasn\u2019t working.

I asked him to come shopping for groceries with me and again, he had some good jokes, but he was noncommittal. We kept it surface level. And it was harder for him because he knew who my boyfriend was before they even met (he knows of him through work) but he didn\u2019t even bring it up. It was like that the first two times we met him. He was just \u201ca nice kid\u201d. Then the third time we met him we opened up a bit more, teasing, joking etc., and he just did what we did. And slowly it developed. Six months later, my boyfriend agreed to sponsor Ollie\u2019s career. Nowadays, both me and my bf help him out with work stuff, we\u2019ve had him over to stay at our place without Chelsea, because he\u2019s in our city for work, my stepdad has helped both him and Chelsea set up investment portfolios. All because we eased into it, he let the situation progress naturally, no pressure. He didn\u2019t come into the house wanting to be an extra sibling, but he is now. Even my bf over time has become close with the family, my stepdad keeps a closer eye on my boyfriend\u2019s career than I do at times \ud83d\ude02\n\nNico isn\u2019t lazy or selfish, I just think sometimes he oversells the family dynamic a bit? He used to do this as a teenager, bring gfs home really quick and kind of flash my stepdad\u2019s money or stuff at them, because he thought it was more interesting than just being himself. Even as adults he would tell people he was dating more about me than he would about himself because he thought I was more successful.

I can either let it drag me down or I stand up and take the steps to move on for now. May not be the healthiest form of coping but with 14+ years of therapy it\u2019s the only one that works for me. I feel bad for Jenny and can relate to her but she also needs to learn to listen to others when they aren\u2019t comfortable with her yet, but on the flip side too, isn\u2019t two years long enough to know if someone \u201cfits\u201d into your family dynamic or not? Like especially if the family gets together often? Am I crazy for thinking that?", "Adding on to this comment. \n\nJenny has likely grown up having to form relationships very fast. A lot of foster kids get yanked around and pulled from place to place. New \u201cfamily\u201d, new school, new friends. \n\nShe might have grown up forming fast but intense relationships because she never knew when they would be over. It may have been the only way to feel closeness because of things formed at a normal pace then she would be yanked away while feeling alone the whole time. \n\nI\u2019d try to reassure her that while she\u2019s coming on way to intense, your family isn\u2019t going anywhere and you\u2019re in this for the long haul. \n\nHow often do any of you initiate contact with her? If the answer is never then she\u2019s also likely overcompensating out of fear of being abandoned and forgotten. \n\nIt\u2019s a lot of trauma that is ultimately hers to deal with. But kindness and patience could help a lot.", "I think this is great advice, but I do wonder if Jenny will take it and move slower or just maintain a polite distance from here on out.

She then takes it upon herself to repeat what she's learned to her classmates, which is fine for a few people, but she starts getting upset when her classmates are completing their tasks a different way. Basically at the end, everyone has a perfectly fine basket of apples, and she learns that there isn't always one right way.

OP, YTA.\n\n*Try to have some fucking empathy.* She grew up in foster care and probably dreamed of having a close family someday. Sure, she's overly enthusiastic, and akward about it, but what examples does she have to draw from?

Your whole post is incredibly negative about her  when she's doing things to try to be part of the family, and what you said cuts particularly deep, even if she overstepped in places.

Have a look at the relationship objectively, are you just purposefully leaving her out because you don't like her? \n\nShe's been around for two years and is marrying your brother; she's part of the family. Step up your sisterly game!", "YTA.  This girl not only has no family but no experience of how a family operates.  Give her a chance or help her to figure it out. If she has no family then why shouldn't she ask you to be her Maid of Honour or hope that your mum would offer her a bridal shower.  Who else can she ask? You all sound really mean.", "YTA, but only because you didn\u2019t tell Jenny directly what you said in Edit #2. \n\nI understand that you expected Nico to communicate with Jenny, but she\u2019s your future SIL and she deserves a direct conversation about the situation. Instead of talking to her and expressing your feelings, you let them fester until you blew up at her. She had no idea you felt this way and it\u2019s fair for her to feel blindsided and extremely hurt.", "Clearly in the minority but YTA for **how** you enforced a boundary. The boundary itself is not the issue, it is reasonable to not feel comfortable discussing certain topics and not having the ability to be her maid of honor, etc. However, it is **not** reasonable for you to require her to pass your OWN tests to be welcomed into a family your brother ALREADY invited her into. His engagement to her was all your family should need to welcome her, she is your family. Yes, in-law relationships look different in every family but how is she supposed to know what yours are ahead of time? This isn't even taking into account her trauma which doesn't give her a pass to crossing boundaries but certainly should allow for room to learn and a KIND conversation rather than a dismissive one. \n\nBased on how you have described this story I wouldn't be surprised if this dismissive and \"you better work for our love\" isn't apparent to her and has made her go into overdrive trying to become a part of your family. You have an opportunity to be a bigger person as someone who is likely more emotionally secure to set an example on how to have a healthy conversation around family conflict/dynamics. Instead you took the opportunity to be blatantly mean, it sounds like you wanted to make her feel unwelcome not on the trip but into your family (whether subconsciously or not). That intent behind your words is what makes you the YTA. Do better. No one should be treated this way and I would take a second look at how you have tried to welcome her into the family and if there is room for improvement. \n\nFully aware there is room for improvement on both sides (Jenny, Nico, etc) but you're asking if YTA in the context of this conversation and the answer is yes.", "Would you say something along the same lines to Chelsea? Like you\u2019re my step sister not my real sister so I Dont owe you anything? If you wouldn\u2019t do that to the family you already have then I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say something so low to your stbSIL. \n\nI get that she\u2019s jarring you and you all find it annoying at best and unbearable at worse but I think there\u2019s nuance to how you communicate with care and respect. I don\u2019t think anything Jenny did from your post warranted that reaction so I\u2019m gonna go with YTA.", "NTA. This is 100% Nico's fault. Nico is enjoying being her knight in shining armour saving her from the 'bad bad world' as she's had 'such a tough life'. Nico needs to grow some balls and chat with his wife-to-be. Meanwhile, this fully adult woman should learn how to respect boundaries. There is no need on your end to apologize for anything. I'd not invite them to anything for sometime until they reach out to apologize to your family for not respecting boundaries.", "This is complicated but it sounds like Nico is the AH. \n\nIt sounds like growing up without a family took a mental toll on Jenny and made it extremely difficult for her to understand appropriate boundaries. Nico should have talked to her about this and given her at least some guidance.", "I keep thinking I want to give Jenny a hug.\n\nI think what op and family should be focusing on isn't Jenny's actions, but the intent behind them before they react. Someone else commented that she's being annoying but not malicious. That's exactly what op needs to remind themselves of.\n\nI take this same approach with my daughter. She's only 5, but I think it applies with Jenny in this situation:\n\nOP - It can be really easy to resent someone and feel angry toward them when they are like an annoying little bee buzzing around your head nonstop, but that's when you need to take a breath and step back. She's not being annoying because she *wants* to annoy you. She's not trying to make you angry. Are you punishing her because she needs to be punished/ashamed etc. due to her actions and needs to learn a lesson? Or are you punishing her because of the way it makes *you* feel? \n\nShe's not feeling entitled *at all* - I'd wager it's probably the opposite. She feels unworthy of your time and familial bonds, and is subconsciously doing whatever she can to prove that she wants to be a part of your family. She doesn't realize that it's annoying you because she's that desperate to feel accepted. She's grasping at anything and just pushing forward with that singular thought in her mind - \"this will make them love me.\"\n\nWhat you've said will stick with her for the rest of her life. Even if things blow over. Even if you forgive each other. Even if you become best friends and she joins your family for real. Even if you all grow to accept her. Even if everyone eventually loves her and she loves you back. \n\nThe damage from that statement is done.\n\nYour last edit would be a good place to start if you want to begin any kind of reconciliation with her. Tell her all of these things. You could write it in a letter even, to ensure you have time to get it right and she has time to absorb the information.   If you don't want to have a relationship with her, that's acceptable. You still need to apologize, and you also need to accept that you probably won't have a relationship with Nico, either. \n\nExplain to her what you've explained to us. Then have a talk with your brother about what he needs to do as the connection been Jenny and the rest of the family. He doesn't get to bring her into this situation and then sit back and expect everyone else to do the work. \n\nJenny sounds like a wounded soul who is reaching for any kind of warmth from the only semblance of family that she has a chance at joining. She wasn't given the tools needed to understand those kinds of relationships. She clearly has no idea about boundaries. It also seems that your resentments have festered to a point that you may not be able to return from. The is a lot of work ahead of everyone if there's any hope of turning things around. It can be done, but you need to have a real heart to heart. Be open, be honest, and set your emotions aside temporarily. \n\nBlending families can be a very delicate situation. There are so many differing personalities, opinions, and personal boundaries that there is a high chance that not everyone will understand one another. Just remember the big picture - we're all here together. We're all deserving of the same things. We all want to be loved. Approach life with that mindset, and hopefully your family will become a little bigger and provide a lost soul with a safe haven. \n\nNAH", "I'm curious what Jenny's background ethnically and that of the family is she stayed with because it could be that for her this behavior is normal. As someone of the Latino community we tend to take spouses rather quickly into the family. And no hate to you but I can't imagine saying that comment to someone because family is a very important thing in my culture. So to basically tell someone that they aren't owed family is almost the same thing as telling them they don't deserve one. And I disagree with the family people deserve being a biological one because I also have a lot of family that is not biological but we have a stronger bond than some of my biological family and I.\n\nI will say soft but firm YTA because I find that comment unnecessary. I can synthesize with the frustration but this was a public humiliation with the people that she wants to be family with. Also I don't believe it's a fair comparison with you having a struggle with your bio father to her being in the system, especially if she did not grow up with her bio family for the vast majority of her life, because you still had a blood tie to your mother and your siblings.  While she was with strangers and many foster kids are moved over and over with little belongings and little time to form bonds.  So many foster kids form close bonds with people early on because they don't know how much time they'll have with people and a need to have that connection is very innate and humans. \n\nAlso if her behavior didn't change when you asked your brother it probably would have been best if someone had a one on one with her instead of such a public thing. Obviously if she didn't cause a scene but just left it means your words hurt her very much. Also your brother going low contact with you guys is also a clear indication of how much it hurt.\n\nI feel like everyone was put into an incredibly uncomfortable situation and your brother could have handled things better but so could you. Ultimately she is clearly  very important to your brother so I think everyone needs to have an open conversation and see how you're going to fix this. Also I do feel like an apology is old for the aggressiveness but that's just how I would deal with the situation.", "YTA. But I get how this level of neediness and social awkwardness is irritating to deal with. She\u2019s coming into a family situation with trauma and not great social skills or understanding of how family dynamics work. You can be patient and understanding and show really good boundaries. Just don\u2019t be cruel or reject her. She\u2019s not acting entitled, she just needs to learn in a loving environment. She\u2019s also still really young. Make an effort, tell her you all love her and want her to be part of the family but you all have to figure out what that looks like over time. She won\u2019t be included in every single thing, she doesn\u2019t get to call your parent\u2019s mom and dad, but she does have a loving family now. People who have never had a securely attached relationship need time and patience to navigate it. She\u2019s just emulating what she\u2019s idolized looking at perfect families. You want this to be a successful navigation and her to integrate into the family, but she\u2019s not going to be easy to get to know or responsive without feeling like she can be safe and vulnerable with you.

Jenny didn't ask you for a kidney, or to inherit the family jewels.  She only asked to go on a trip with her future MIL and SILs.  You want her to develop natural relationships with you all.  That happens by being in contact, discussing family news, attending family events, going on trips etc:  unfortunately these are some of the things that you are objecting  to .    She is inexperienced in family interactions (missing decades of family life) , and you apparently need to be consistently clear and non-judgmental, over time, about the things your family does and doesn't do.

What do you and your family do to \"try to get to know her\"? \n\nI think you guys are just cold-hearted people and are possibly looking down on her because of her childhood. She has rules to follow to become one of you, but is that true for all in-laws or friends or do those people magically fit the mold of your family?

Sounds like never to me. You all seem a bit icy, to be honest, at least to Jenny and maybe to Nico, too, who must feel the (step) you put between yourselves and him. \n\nI suspect Nico has known from the beginning you all don\u2019t like her and that probably hurts him. It may feel to him like he now has to choose between his family and his girlfriend.

Two years is a decent chunk of time, how much more time do you need to form a relationship?", "So this is a tough one. She's definitely crossed some boundaries but it also seems like you guys are giving her no feedback beyond \"no\" and \"back off\" or just timidly talking to Nico behind her back?

We\u2019ve been together for so long now and they are so integrated into my life now that it\u2019s weird to remember back to what things were like at the beginning. I desperately wanted their acceptance and was worried I would never feel like part of the family. It was the security of my own family and my own childhood that made it possible for me to take things slowly and not try to push it.

Unless they never met before hand the first two things on their list to get to know each other should have happened by now.", "Yeah I don\u2019t see Jenny as a bad person either. Though I do think Nico is completely failing his partner and even setting her up for failure with his reluctance to do anything of significance despite the very visible issues that even his family has asked him to course correct.", "100% agree with you on this as someone who was once in Jenny's position. Went through foster care, when I met my now husband in high-school, he was the only thing I had. His family would leave me out of a lot and it was very, very hurtful. We are very close now and have that family aspect, but it took a long time and a lot of hurtful things. Tbh... it sounds to me like this is OPs problem with Jenny. She's saying Jenny hasn't created a connection, but it sounds like Jenny is trying and they're rejecting it because of their own hang-ups and trying to place the blame on Jenny. I feel sorry for her and wish nothing but the best and that she is able to find that family connection one day with people who aren't stuck up assholes.", "Genuinely I am surprised at the comments here. As soon as I read that comment I was like \"Surely she is the AH\" but I guess not. I get it though - it's just that there are so many other ways to say something without being an asshole yourself. You don't need to be blunt and rude to make your point. All she wants to do is be included and tbh annoying or not, the whole thing feels exclusionary to me simply because they don't like how much she wants to have a family herself/don't like her clinginess. I get not liking someone but especially if it's a family trip, why wouldn't you invite her? Were any other girls in the family not going or was it just her, for example? It also comes across to me like OPs family isn't doing much/anything to actually \"try\" and include her which could be why Jenny is pushing as hard as she is. It feels like OPs view is \"we had to work to be accepted, why shouldn't she?\" which tbh I don't agree with that at all. I think both sides need to put in the work. She is clearly putting in her side, and I read this story as OPs family not wanting to put in the work because they are \"already part of the family.\"", "Totally agree. For a lot of people family (and the ideal of family) means love no matter what. So I totally understand in Jenny really wanted that, she wouldn\u2019t see the need to go slow in her approach. She\u2019s family therefore you all love her. Super harsh reaction to someone who clearly just wants to be included. YTA", "YTA is my vote also. I agree there\u2019s a lack of empathy here. It\u2019s comes across in the way OP words a lot of the post too. I also don\u2019t think it was necessary to call her out in a room full of people and make it an \u201ceveryone thinks\u201d vs Jenny making it clear she\u2019s an outsider. The way OP writes that Jenny just expected to be part of the family without trying enough to \u201cbuild\u201d the relationship rubs me wrong as well. That\u2019s exactly what she was trying to do\u2026 she didn\u2019t go about to the way OP wanted so now she\u2019s screwed? And what has OP and her family done to welcome Jenny and \u201cbuild\u201d a relationship?", "i agree with this. i have bpd, and things people say (especially mean things) can stick with me for a long, long time due to the attachment issues that come along with bpd. i'm sure this girl has attachment issues as well, after growing up in the foster system. although it's clear this conflict has been building for a while and there were attempts to resolve the issue more civilly, i can't help but imagine how hurt jenny must feel and how this comment will stay with her for a long time, even if relations with op's family improve and they can build a true relationship. she will likely never be truly comfortable around op's family again. to me it almost feels similar to the way that a \"weird\" kid might think they have friends at school, only to find out that people are only tolerating them and no one thinks they're friends. op says they understand, but i don't think they truly do.\n\ni think what would've worked better is to have the same whole-family sit down they had with nico, but with jenny there as well. it would've sounded better coming straight from the horse's mouth, i think, instead of nico watering it down or not telling jenny at all for fear of hurting her feelings.\n\nalthough, as a final piece, i am also curious what measures the family took to include jenny proactively, instead of jenny always tagging along. if she doesn't feel like she's actively wanted as part of the family, she may be grasping at straws to cling to the potential for a relationship.", "They've tried for years.  Enough is enough.", "For real, they're all acting like it's Jenny's job to make herself feel welcome while they act like the popular clique in high school. Just snobbish behavior.", "I really can\u2019t imagine how the others want Nico to say. Exactly what would he say? \u201cHey sweetheart, we\u2019ve been engaged for two years now. But the truth is my sister is still holding you at an arms length because you haven\u2019t \u201cearned\u201d your way in yet. You need to stop trying to be yourself and get close to them to build a relationship, yet at the same time, earn your place and their trust by stepping aside during family photos and outings because you don\u2019t belong and you need to show that you know you don\u2019t belong.\u201d\n\nWhat a hard and unnecessary conversation to have? OP is a standard issue Mean Girl. YTA!", "Yes! The part missing from this post is when has anyone in the family tried to get to know her, include her, invite her (and not as the automatic plus one of Nico)? From the start it\u2019s as if all she\u2019s heard is what she\u2019s doing and saying wrong, and how she doesn\u2019t belong. It\u2019s just Jenny vs. this big family. It would be perfectly acceptable for a family to reach out to an incoming member and give a little grace. It looks like she was never granted that from the start.

They definitely don't as a matter of course where I live. And they certainly don't get therapy specifically to deal with the trauma of being separated from their families and living with strangers, much less whatever trauma their families went through that got them placed in care in the first place. At best, they have a case manager who checks up on them as often as they can, but usually only every few weeks, and they'll get court ordered into therapy if they start running away or otherwise acting out, but it's not part of the routine process if the kid's trauma shows up in ways that are quiet and well-behaved.", "A lot of commenters keep saying to \u201clet things grow more organically\u201c.

There has been major drama and I'm pretty sure I will never see my brother again other than at family events, once things are settled.\n\nHe went against the wishes my mom wrote in her will right from the very day after her funeral.

Relying on individual social workers to check that the kids are actually benefiting from therapy is a bad system, imo. Same with relying on individual states to enforce federal requirements (I mean, look at ADA compliance lol it sucks even here in California).", "NTA and I say this as someone who had an abusive, neglectful single mother addicted to drugs and alcohol and was put into The Foster Care System at 8 years old, separated from my 2 younger siblings, till I aged out at 18.\n\nYes, Jenny has been with your brother for 2 years and usually that is enough time to form some closer bonds with people and really get to know eachother. But not the way she did it. She tried to push connections too fast. She wanted to immediately be as close as sisters or best friends upon first meeting you and your family. Relationships that close take time and real effort. You don't automatically get treated like a close relative by getting engaged to someone. Yes you're technically apart of the family once married but the bonds and feelings of closeness take time and effort on everyone's part and can't be rushed or forced.\n\nI don't agree with all these comments saying she just doesn't understand how a family works because she was in foster care. It doesn't matter if she's never had a blood family, you take cues from the people around you, you listen to them when they tell you that they are uncomfortable with something you are doing. You don't ignore them and continue doing things your way. It's clearly having the opposite effect from what she wants. \n\nPushing boundaries and constantly ignoring what you and your family are telling her is not ok. You don't need to be brought up with a family to understand that. \n\nI'm also a person who is off put by people who try to immediately be close to me upon the first time meeting me. It feels weird and intrusive and very uncomfortable because I just do not feel the same as they do. Even if I initially like the person and think we could become friends, the intrusiveness of their immediate strong feelings turns me away and makes me want to avoid them. \n\nFrom Jenny's perspective, what you said was definitely very hurtful and will stay with her a long time, but It came after you and your family have tried to tell her calmly that she's being too much too fast and pushing boundaries and trying to force closeness. There's only so much people can take before they snap and say something harsher then necessary. \n\nUpon your second meeting with this woman, she immediately says it's ok to talk about your sex life with her because that's \"what sisters do\", she's not your sister and she's not letting you build up those feelings naturally and pushes the topic when you've told her it makes you uncomfortable. That's rude and ignores your boundaries.\n\nShe asked you to be MOH, which would have been amazing had you felt close enough to her to want to take on that responsibility, but your schedule was packed and you didn't feel close enough to her to accept the honor. Which is your right. But instead of just taking your no as an answer, she hounded you for a week and became upset and bombarded you with text messages until you felt the need to show her your schedule to proved that you were too busy to do this for her. And yes it is common and normal for the SIL to be asked to participate in the wedding party but again that's usually because there is an established bond between the bride and SIL, which she has not let form naturally and is actually pushing you away because of her insistence on forcing the bond.\n\nShe seeks out and friends random distant family members that you and your family don't even talk to that often and tries to insert herself into the family dynamic, again, without actually letting that closeness manifest naturally. These people don't even know her even a little bit and had to reach out to you and your family for why this seemingly random stranger was messaging them on Facebook. \n\nShe keeps insisting on referring to your parents as \"Mom\" & \"Dad\" even though they've told her they are uncomfortable with this. Again, marrying into a family does not afford you closeness and family intimacy. Some families are perfectly ok with this but your's has specifically said they don't like it and that's what matters. She needs to respect boundaries.\n\nIt would be great if you could apologize to her but also explain to her again that she needs to let these relationships form naturally and listen to you and your family when they tell her your boundaries and what you're uncomfortable with. Let her know that you do genuinely want to make a connection with her and become a true family but that she needs to stop forcing the interactions and the level of closeness. \n\nTry and plan some outings with her to show her that you mean it when you say you want to get to know her. Go on lunches and ask her questions about her interests, music she likes, and movies she's interested in. Ask her about hobbies or activities she likes. Basically, lead by example. And if she still tries to force things to be closer then you're ready for, gently let her know that she's crossing boundaries.", "YTA all the way. It's normal to be frustrated in this situation, but what you said was intentionally hurtful. Your callous disregard for her feelings is disgusting. You were cruel, when instead you could have been considerate of her feelings while trying to make your point.", "YTA. Even though everyone deserves a proper family as a child, not everyone gets that opportunity. That is a low statement to say to someone that doesn\u2019t know their parents. You guys made her more of an outsider to your family now, by making that statement.", "Yta massively", "YTA\n\nYou all know she grew up in an emotionally traumatizing foster environment without a foundation for relationship building skills and yet you seem to expect her to act as if she grew up like you did. Just cause she has a friend or two doesn\u2019t mean she knows how to avoid social mistakes all the time. \n\nYou\u2019ve been expecting her to mind read and just \u201cget it\u201d instead of explaining gently how she is making everyone feel. For someone who\u2019s going to marry into the family, the subtext of your attitude toward a new family member is rather cold and callous. It\u2019s not entitlement. It\u2019s chronic loneliness and never having been taught people skills. It\u2019s social naivety from a lifetime of neglect.\n\nI grew up an isolated only child in a cult and I had similar socially needy behavior as an adult until I got therapy and built a new support network. Y\u2019all sound really callous and lacking in understanding of how horrible her background likely is. She was probably excited to finally have a family and a stable support network and instead she gets shit on and rejected.\n\nIt\u2019s on you guys to communicate clearly even with someone who doesn\u2019t have these struggles. No one should expect others to mind read off indirect signals. When I was in her shoes I would have done anything for people to just be honest and direct about what I needed to fix about my behavior to be included, or to explain how and why I was making them uncomfortable, because I didn\u2019t know I was doing so and didn\u2019t mean to. The last thing I wanted to be doing was making anyone I cared about uncomfortable, but people acted as if I were doing it with ill intent.\n\nTrauma causes neurodivergence. ND people often people have a hard time reading social hints. People who grew up in fucked up family environments or with neglect don\u2019t understand boundaries because they never had any. They don\u2019t know what normal looks like. \n\nMost families I know are a LOT more welcoming at the start to girlfriends and fianc\u00e9s than you describe your family\u2019s behavior. She was likely expecting that as well but instead is being treated almost like an enemy invader to the family, judging by your wording. \n\nMy own partner\u2019s mom and sister were telling me they love me after less than a year of him and I dating, despite my oversharing and missing social cues, they invite me to all family functions and even on a week international vacation with them. You guys just sound mean and unwelcoming by comparison.\n\nShe\u2019s going to be family. Care enough to HELP her instead of judging her and excluding her.  She doesn\u2019t know she\u2019s pushing for artificial intimacy. From her perspective this treatment probably feels cruel and isolating.\n\nIt really sucks that symptoms of loneliness (desperation, inviting self, getting too close too fast) are often what keeps one lonely, and nobody even tells them why.", "You and your family are the assholes; she may have friends but that doesn\u2019t mean she understands relationships (HELLO she\u2019s never had a family, where most relationships are learned by experience). No idea if your brother spoke to her, he likely did, but the person with the problem is you- are you not an adult?? \n\nLike it or not, if they do get married she will be your family and I don\u2019t think you understand how truly disrespectful to your brother it was that you 1) asked him to squash your issue for you like a schoolyard child and 2) that you would degrade his life partner that he chose for not having boundaries for something she\u2019s never had. She\u2019s no doubt learned the hard way that she\u2019s been ignorant and overbearing, but if this is what your family is about then I think y\u2019all are red flags- since it seems you know your family and upbringing is a privilege yet you emotionally abused someone for approaching it the wrong way even though they clearly value both the literal and conceptual family albeit romanticized. You owe and the entirety of the family that sat down with your brother owe them both an apology; you may not agree but you can take my guarantee to the bank that your brother and his fianc\u00e9e WILL NOT forget this for a LONG TIME. \n\nYou all have created a schism within your own family bc it couldn\u2019t be just how you like it, ironically family seems to always show you life is rarely like that so maybe there\u2019s some things y\u2019all need to work out outside of this new drama this family now has. To quote another comment on this post: \u201cwhen Jenny and your brother quit coming around to any family functions, just remember, \u2018They don't owe you a family\u2019\u201d", "Hmm... I'm going with YTA. You have mentioned very concrete things that you don't want her a part of -- everything from photos to conversations to trips. But while you say you've tried to make her feel a part of the family, you don't list anything concrete at all. What have you done to make her feel a part of your family that doesn't include your brother? My guess is not much. Also, if you know she has issues with feeling left out, why are you discussing a trip that she's not included in in front of her? I mean, sure, you have every right to, but you already know she's going to feel hurt and left out by it. I think there's more going on here. I wish we could hear her side of it.", "YTA. I feel so bad for her. I know very well how it feels to be the outsider in a cliquey family. You reminded her that she isn\u2019t wanted by ANY family.", "YTA - you are always the AH when you throw someone's trauma in their face. Whether you agree with her ways or not, you KNOW that Jenny is desperate for a family. How can you say you are open to a relationship with her, but have not made one in TWO years. You act like they just started dating. You say that you want her to build a relationship organically, but she asked you to be her MOH and you told her she wasn't worth your time. She asked your Mom to throw her a wedding shower (which is sad, because knowing her situation one of you should have stepped up and offered before she had to ask) and she told her that she wasn't worth her time. \n\nYou have said often in your replies to comments that you feel like you are compromising and she has not done anything... but what exactly have you compromised? You say you have told her multiple times that you don't want to talk about certain subjects, but obviously the topics are being brought up by someone in front of her. Your parents, knowing that she doesn't have a Mom or a Dad of her own, could come up with another name that feels OK to them, but makes Jenny feel special and part of the family. \n\nIt feels from your post and replies that you put her in a box when she offended you during your second meeting and she has been fighting your entire relationship to get out of that box.  That's not fair, and effectively made it impossible for a friendship to grow. All this to say, you are going to lose your brother if you don't apologize. You hit her deep, and for that you owe her an apology. I hope you can find a way to make amends and put the past in the past and start anew.", "YTA - I'm sure I'll get downvoted, but I don't care.  This forum acts like not being legally obligated and not being an AH are same thing.  \n\nThis girl grew up in foster care.  She never had a stable environment and longs for a family.  Are you legally obligated to provide her with one? No.  But that's not the forum. \n\nHave you considered that what you are perceiving as intrusiveness is just her trying to fit into your family?  Have you pulled her aside and said \"look, I want to be close, but I'm uncomfortable talking about XYZ, can you please respect that?\"  \n\nYour perception is really the key here.  She \"tried to make me the maid of honor\" instead of \"invited me to be her maid of honor\"  Did she demand a bridal party or just expect it because no one else was going to do it, and she thinks you're a good family? (Newsflash: bridal parties aren't just for the bride, the man uses home items too) She attempted to call your parents by \"Mom and Dad\" to show affection, and they don't want that either.  It sounds an awful lot like she's trying to bond with you, and show you love the best way she knows how, and you all for whatever reason want to reject it.  \n\nIt really feels like, to me, based on your words and edits, that you always felt you had to prove yourself to be loved.  You don't think your stepdad offered love willingly, you had to earn it.  You didn't get dropped into a perfect, loving family, you had to earn it with your mom and (step) family.  And you now think it's outrageous than some other person, who has never had anyone, walks into a good family and hopes and tries her best to fit in, and wishes to be accepted without \"earning it\"  That's really not a big ask.  If you love Nico, and will love your future nieces and nephews, then you should probably accept the woman he wants to marry without conditions, until she gives you a reason not to accept her.  And attempting to fit in with you, and be a part of your family after TWO YEARS and an engagement, is not unreasonable.  You all learning a tad bit of empathy, is also not unreasonable.\n\nBut for her to say \"well I would hope i get invited to FAMILY Activities\" and you to immediately try to tell her, \"sorry two years isn't enough time to earn our love\" makes you an enormous AH\n\nIf you value the family you had to earn, and want your brother in your life, I would recommend apologizing, explaining why you had irritation, and maybe work on learning that love can be given willingly.", "YTA imo. You can say \"no\" nicely. Even 100 times. Even 1,000 times. There's no limit to how long a person can be nice to another person (especially one who is practically family whether you like it or not), so why are you entitled to be mean now? *You* lost patience. It's as simple as that. She's not great, but it doesn't entitle you to snap.", "NTA.  It was a low blow and I think you do owe her the kinder explanation you put in the edit, but honestly nothing *less* than that sounds like it worked.  Nico stepping up maybe would have, but... then he didn't.\n\nFor the record I don't think Jenny is either, everything you described would be understandable bordering on predictable from somebody who didn't have a chance to learn family dynamics the right way but always really wanted one.  Like what you were saying about how she can't just \"parachute in\" -- It's not like foster parents meet kids and hang out with them for a couple months before moving on to the next stage of becoming their foster parents... She basically *was* parachuted into each family unit she's had, and they basically went \"Well, we're a family now.\"  That's her entire experience.\n\nNico, on the other hand, had a very clear view into the situation, what with your entire family trying to get him to talk to her about it.  He saw the poop, the fan, and the orangutang and thought \"if I ignore it long enough, nothing bad will happen.\"  Nico's TA.", "Honestly NTA, but I do think this is a bad situation. She is desperately longing for a family, but pushing herself in instead of building relationships naturally over time. \n\nI car deeply for my SIL in a way I didn\u2019t 10 years ago. Shared history and mutual respect is important. \n\nNico needs to be more honest with her that her attempts aren\u2019t being well received and perhaps inviting his family to some therapy sessions with her would help explain some healthier boundaries and expectations.\n\n\nOP I do think an apology for her feelings being hurt might go a long way.

Maybe you should tell her that, while she\u2019s indeed welcomed into the family, she\u2019s trying way too hard and it\u2019s coming across as a bit pushy. Tell her to relax and just be herself. To take her time and let things gel. There are more appropriate ways to get to know each other. \nYour brother, however, is TA. You went to him with your concerns and trusted him to handle it discreetly. And he knowingly buried his head in the sand. His negligence has stitched both parties up for this to happen. Jenny needs to know that you did try but he didn\u2019t bother. \nMaybe offer her an olive branch to start again with the reasonable terms mentioned above. Reassure her that you\u2019re not a family that she can lose to the system and that you hope to be in her life for a long time as long as she just calms down and finds her feet.", "Yeah, for sure. I remember being told about something that was said about me that wasn\u2019t even totally unfair it was just super harsh and it made me so sad\u2026 I was definitely having the hardest experience of my life at that time and I didn\u2019t come back around for a couple years despite regular invitations. Even after that I wasn\u2019t cool with anyone quite the same way, not out of spite but I just\u2026 can\u2019t feel comfortable anymore. It\u2019s awkward because they\u2019re gonna be tied together in that way through marriage but it\u2019s entirely possible that she\u2019ll hold onto feeling unwelcome on some level for a very long time if not forever. She\u2019s experienced a certain amount of trauma and feeling unwanted is probably a core fear and insecurity of hers. \n\nI can understand OP feeling how she feels but she absolutely did damage with her choice of words and her choice of delivery.", "Yeah it\u2019s been two years, Jenny shouldn\u2019t still be like a stranger to them that only entered the picture some months ago.

Gatekeeping is exactly the word for it. \"You can't just parachute your way into a family\" tbh yes you can, by marrying into it. I think OP's family has some fucked up dynamics of their own.", ".... today I found out my family is abnormal", "Yeah and TV isn\u2019t exactly the best teacher, because how dramatic is healthy coping mechanisms and boundary setting? We would have very little story if none of that were an issue. We\u2019ve NEVER seen a toxic couple on TV before. /s\n\nI\u2019m glad you\u2019re getting help and learning how to recognize cues, and happy to know I\u2019m in the ballpark here.", "OP thought she was going to put Jenny in her place once and for all for the whole family and clearly feels justified. She\u2019s only asking here because step bro has gone low contact and who can blame him. I don\u2019t know, feels like she\u2019s hoping to get a verdict in her favor so she can show step bro and maybe he\u2019ll even agree how much Jenny sucks and dump her. Maybe that\u2019s what she wants\u2026since all of these other \u201ctalks\u201d with him about Jenny haven\u2019t worked. Op really needs to let stepbro (and Jenny) go.", "Yeah, this family thinks too highly of themselves, when they're no better than bullies.", "Agreed. The only person who I suspect is TA is Nico, and that's assuming he hasn't actually made the effort to have the hard conversation with his fiance, which we just don't know the answer to since it seems like OP herself doesn't know either.", "It also really depends on the family - I would have no issue discussing medication with my siblings, and I went to \u2018magic dyke\u2019 a trans/drag show with my wife (gay) and sister in law (bi but only realised that as a result of coming to these things with us and married to a man) which was a pretty raunchy show to say the least. They also shared a flat when me and my wife first started dating and she once had to tell us we needed to tighten the screws on our bed up because the noises of what we were doing had put her off what she was doing. That was pretty embarrassing. I would discuss sex with my brother in general terms, to a pretty explicit level but wouldn\u2019t go in to specifics of my sex life. My parents in law are catholic and didn\u2019t even let us share a bed until marriage, my mum likes to pretend she\u2019s outraged by lewd conversations but can make a smutty joke like the best of them. So even if you\u2019ve grown up in a \u2018normal family\u2019 your \u2018normal family\u2019 and the \u2018normal family\u2019 you marry in to might be wildly different anyway.", "I have a friend who doesn\u2019t call her FiL anything because he once instructed her then bf, now husband, to tell her to call him Mr. Lastname after she called him by his first \u2026 seven years into dating while at the same time her MiL was trying to get her to call her mom. She just \u2026 doesn\u2019t address him by anything. People are weird.\n\nPersonally, I\u2019d never be able to call in laws mom and dad, but I also don\u2019t see it as being a huge deal."]}
