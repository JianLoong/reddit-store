I'd also like to preface that we already have matching sisters tattoos.\n\nThis all came about a few months ago when one of my sisters (F31) wanted to get a new tattoo and said we should get a matching family tattoo. I was already turned off by the idea as we already have matching tattoos and I'm not close with my brothers or parents. I said right off the bat that I will not get something that I don't like.\n\nRecently, she brought up the idea of a flower bouquet where we all draw our own flowers. I suggested we all draw something else because l've seen that done so many times already, but all my ideas were immediately rejected. I also hate flower tattoos, I think they're corny. After that, no one talked about it.\n\nA couple of days ago my sister (F29) texted me a picture of birth-month flowers and a bouquet drawing from a jewelry ad and said this is our tattoo. I said I rather we draw them, at least that's a little more original. She didn't care. That's also when I found out only half the family would be getting this \"family\" tattoo. My older brother is stubborn and would never get a tattoo he didn't pick himself (known knowledge), my other brother is too young, and my parents are too old. That's when I said count me out too. I don't like the design and the sentiment isn't there if we don't all get it. \n\nNow my sisters are being passive aggressive towards me.

If it isn't already designed, a \"Family tattoo\" should be something that everyone in the family gets a say on, not just your sisters.\n\nIt sounds like only your sisters are wanting this.

They will be regretting those tattoos next family feud LOL. Tell them its a nice sentiment but if she was going to get something everyone has, the least they could have done is pick on they can all AGREE on, who the hell wants a random tat their sister picks out, ew. She made NO effort to try to find something everyone would like and got a tattoo for herself, not \"for the family\". She needs to stop pretending like this tattoo is for anyone other than herself. \n\nMaybe you could have tried to suggest things you would have liked but if you didnt like the idea to begin with, I can understand why you didn't try and no one should fault you for that.  It kinda strikes me a cult-like that she would want a family tattoo that no one has a say in, like a weird power trip.\n\nI like the idea of tattoos that aren't the same but follow similar styles and themes for matching tattoos WAY better. Maybe your family would be open to everyone picking their own design to get done by the same artist your sister used. Its like you have a family tattoo but its unique to each person and you dont have to gett something you dont want.", "NTA . Tattoos are a personal and to force someone to get inked with something they aren't happy with is an AH thing to do.", "NTA\n\nGetting a tattoo is a very personal and permanent choice.

Your sisters sound like they are 15. Isn\u2019t it kind of embarrassing to passive aggressively try to neg a family member into getting a corny flower tattoo? This is corny as hell. I like your stubborn brother who made a very independent decision to unilaterally reject tattoos, and also your other brother who rejected it due to corniness.

No family, or friend has a right to ask you to do that. \n\nI absolutely know that this is wildly a different situation and I'm in NO WAY comparing your family to this but, in my opinion as a Jew - there is a type of  tattoo that was forced and was branded upon people during the war.   As such we should all learn from this that all human beings should and do have the right to total autonomy over their own body - because no one should ever be coerced into branding themselves with something they do not want. \n\nI am also very heavily tattooed so my opinion is not based upon any dislike of body art.", "NTA, this is your decision only that matter.", "You aren't obliged to get any more tattoos.nta", "NTA\n\nThis is your body they are demanding you decorate permanently with the design they choose.
