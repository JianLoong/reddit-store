We are doing a very small ceremony and originally wanted only 25 people (both due to cost and just that we wanted something more intimate). My family and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family are located in different states. The ceremony is in neither of those states, but we have been clear that people don\u2019t have to come if the travel is too much. Despite it being a very small event, my mom has been in sort of a craze. One thing we have been arguing about consistently is the guest list. Before you ask, yes, she is contributing to the wedding. As is my father (they are divorced) and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s father. It is not a whole lot of money as it is not a big wedding, but with those contributions we are paying for almost nothing ourselves. My mom seems to think that by contributing to the wedding, she gets to decide who comes from her side of the family. I have been open to hearing her out, and as a result my list has already increased from 25 to about 40. I am trying not to be close-minded, but I also feel like as it is my wedding, it should be my choice. \n\nHere is where I may be the AH. I have gotten very sick of the arguments about guest lists. This has been going on for months and I have conceded almost every time. The other day, she texted me to ask if I invited a distant family member who lived far away that I hadn\u2019t seen or heard from in probably 10 years. I said no. She called me immediately and said she was confused because she knew we talked about it and she couldn\u2019t remember where WE had landed. She went on to say that she found it hard to believe WE hadn\u2019t included that distant family member as WE had talked about maybe inviting him. I finally lost my composure, and said, \u201cNo, I did not invite him because I never see or talk to him, so that is what I decided.\u201d (Very large emphasis on the \u201cI\u201ds). She sorta scoffed and expressed confusion, and I told her that she keeps saying \u201cwe\u201d and that it is MY wedding and \u201cI\u201d will decide. She went silent and I changed the subject. I\u2019ve hardly heard from her since (though she has been very busy with work). \n\nI\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the AH because she has expressed to me that \u201ctraditionally, if the parent is contributing then they have a say in who is invited.\u201d I told her I understood where she was coming from, but if her contribution was conditional and came with stipulations on who I need to invite, I don\u2019t want it. She hasn\u2019t brought that specifically (contributing to the wedding) since. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1691594851, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15mignq/aita_for_telling_my_mom_that_we_didnt_invite/", "score": 2320, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Be it the guest list, the caterer, photographer, etc. But you are willing to not accept money if your mother forces these stipulations.

I suspect that you mother is well-meaning and I hope this doesn't put a strain on your relationship, but parents often forget that they can't just dictate decisions to their adult children. Weddings can be stressful and people with grand ideas tend to heap the stress onto the situation without realizing it. You set a boundary with your statement, and while it may be construed as \"rude\", you were putting your foot down and sometimes it needs to be done with some hard truth.   \nI don't know your relationship with your mother or how you've historically handled conflict with her, but I think maybe just a conversation aside from the actual wedding planning is in order. Just something to explain your perspective and set your boundaries. Remind her that an entire **other** family is involved and you're trying to keep things uncomplicated, fair, and comfortable for **you and your partner.** I'm sure that you want her to enjoy the wedding as well, but it isn't a family reunion.

Honestly, she shouldn\u2019t be forcing any invitations on to you and your guest list should still be 25.\n\nWhen I got married (my husband and I paid EVERYTHING), I asked my parents if they wanted to invite someone (I was prepared to give them 10 receptions) they said no, just asked about 3 specific family friends and I said I had already considered them so they left it at that.\n\nApart from my parents I have an aunt who I used to love like a second mother, she has this micromanaging problem, also she believes that if she contributes financially to something she is entitled to do her will. Reminder: husband and I paid our wedding. \n\nWell, I invited everybody on my family except this one cousin, like I invited her parents and siblings but not her specifically. She knows why. My aunt made a huge deal about this and tried to convince me of changing my mind, which I was very loud and clear. She then proceeded to visit my parents house and talk to my mother who firmly said she is behind me and will respect my wishes. As she didn\u2019t get what she wanted she proceeded to talk to my dad (her brother), my dad was firm too and said that it was my wedding, my decisions and that they respect that and that she wouldn\u2019t convince him of anything and to drop the subject.\n\nBefore all this went down I had already talked to my husband and my parents so they were so ready for this to happen.\n\nI had very valid reasons to not invite her. At the end, her parents and all her 3 siblings (with their spouses) attended my wedding.\n\nMy parents always backed me up, and I highly value that.", "NTA. \n\nAs someone who went through this, my biggest piece of advice is stand your ground and hold firm that you and your fiance only want those who are nearest and dearest to you. This is a wedding, not a party or an opportunity to show off. \n\nEven if she was offering to pay for all those people that she is inviting, no, why would I want someone there that I haven't seen in 10 years? just to never see them for another 10 , 20 years?", "Nta and I'm so happy I paid for my own damn wedding.", "NTA- some parents are weird about this. My grandparents were adamant when my parents got married about inviting certain people.

Crazy to me but different generations see things differently.", "When I get married (things may change depending on who I marry) my intention is give my mother a table to play hostess. She can invite whoever she wants as long as she keeps them at her table.", "NTA - it's YOUR wedding, it's YOUR big day, you get to make the calls on literally everything. The money she contributes is a gift to you as her daughter, not a buy in. You might also explain to her that it's time for ridiculous traditions to die and they are and have been for a while now. So basically no, contributing doesn't mean she can take over your wedding.", "NTA.\n\nI am of the camp that thinks if parents contribute money to the wedding, they do have a right to say they want some guests invited whom the bride/groom wouldn't have invited. This shouldn't be about forcing unwanted guests on the couple, obviously - but if the parents are paying for a big party, yeah, they do get to say \"sure, you wouldn't have thought inviting Aunt Mildred, but I'm paying for a large number of people to have a meal and I should get to choose a few relatives that wouldn'r have occurred to you\".  Anyone who doesn't like their parents inviting distant relatives should pay entirely for their own wedding, and that removes that problem.  \n\n\nBut.

At this point I'd ask myself \"can we do it *without* her contribution?\" and if the answer is YES, return the money to her and go back to the original list.", "NTA, but you need to have a conversation with your mom about how many people she can invite. Please set a max number, and don't allow anyone after that.", "She already has \u201chad a say.\u201d", "If you haven't sent out the invites, remind her you only wanted 25 and if she is adamant she can have 10.

NTA", "NAH\n\nGiven the fact that you're not having to pay for your own wedding, it strikes me that your families may have a bit of an old fashioned view when it comes to weddings. Traditionally, the people getting married, especially the bride, were passengers in the occasion, with the majority of the organising being done by the families of the couple. As much as it was for the couple, it was also for the families involved to project status, by showing off the marriage to relatives and such.\n\nSo I honestly think this could just be a case of mis-matched expectations. Your parents wanted to fund the wedding and also have some say in it, whereas you thought they just wanted to pay for it and you could have whatever you wanted, as a gift to you and your soon-to-be-husband or soon-to-be-wife.\n\nI don't think your Mum has done anything drastically wrong here and I think you have pent up your frustrations to the point where you finally said something that wouldn't have been particular hurtful, just a shock.\n\nYou need to get your fiancee and your parents together and have a conversations about what the expectations are for all of you. If that means that your parents don't contribute in order fr you to have the wedding you want then so be it. It seems like you're prepared for that outcome from the post so it should hopefully work out. You just need to all communicate with each other.", "NTA \n\nShe did have input into who was invited. \n\nAdvice, not that you asked for it: \n\nRemind her that your original goal was 25 people, total.

It really bothers me when people contribute money to weddings conditionally like this. If you don't want to contribute, fine, but don't act like giving some money means you get to dictate the planning. It sounds like you've already made some concessions, which to an extent, I think is appropriate, but you're absolutely right. It's your wedding.

We are doing a very small ceremony and originally wanted only 25 people (both due to cost and just that we wanted something more intimate). My family and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s family are located in different states. The ceremony is in neither of those states, but we have been clear that people don\u2019t have to come if the travel is too much. Despite it being a very small event, my mom has been in sort of a craze. One thing we have been arguing about consistently is the guest list. Before you ask, yes, she is contributing to the wedding. As is my father (they are divorced) and my fianc\u00e9\u2019s father. It is not a whole lot of money as it is not a big wedding, but with those contributions we are paying for almost nothing ourselves. My mom seems to think that by contributing to the wedding, she gets to decide who comes from her side of the family. I have been open to hearing her out, and as a result my list has already increased from 25 to about 40. I am trying not to be close-minded, but I also feel like as it is my wedding, it should be my choice. \n\nHere is where I may be the AH. I have gotten very sick of the arguments about guest lists. This has been going on for months and I have conceded almost every time. The other day, she texted me to ask if I invited a distant family member who lived far away that I hadn\u2019t seen or heard from in probably 10 years. I said no. She called me immediately and said she was confused because she knew we talked about it and she couldn\u2019t remember where WE had landed. She went on to say that she found it hard to believe WE hadn\u2019t included that distant family member as WE had talked about maybe inviting him. I finally lost my composure, and said, \u201cNo, I did not invite him because I never see or talk to him, so that is what I decided.\u201d (Very large emphasis on the \u201cI\u201ds). She sorta scoffed and expressed confusion, and I told her that she keeps saying \u201cwe\u201d and that it is MY wedding and \u201cI\u201d will decide. She went silent and I changed the subject. I\u2019ve hardly heard from her since (though she has been very busy with work). \n\nI\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m the AH because she has expressed to me that \u201ctraditionally, if the parent is contributing then they have a say in who is invited.\u201d I told her I understood where she was coming from, but if her contribution was conditional and came with stipulations on who I need to invite, I don\u2019t want it. She hasn\u2019t brought that specifically (contributing to the wedding) since. \n\nAITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

My dad paid for half of my wedding because he insisted hard. I didn't need his money. It was a big wedding and he and my mom were allowed to invite some people (mainly their friends, people I didn't even know). Fine, it was agreed. 2 weeks before the wedding I discovered that my dad and stepmom printed extra invitations and handed them to guests not on the list. How I discovered? Someone RSVP \" no\" and I had no idea who that person was. That led to a massive argument, with him shouting things like \"I'm paying for the wedding\", \"I can pay for the extra guests\" (it was at that point a problem of capacity at the venue). I, like you, said it was my wedding and I didn't ask for the money, he offered, and I could pay him back if that was the case. The call ended with him saying that he wouldn't come to my wedding and me telling him not to come then.\n\nHe did come and walked me down the aisle, though I was not sure of his presence until a few days before. He never apologized in person, he wrote an email with a half ass apology, which I read and deleted.\n\nWhy am I sharing this story?

He's not allowed to comment on anything to me the entire day. And if he tries his usual moves and gets under my skin I'll throw him out myself.

That should be enough.\n\nShe is entitled to the courtesy of at least considering her requests, but she is **absolutely not** entitled to change the entire nature of the wedding you want, and adding guest after guest will do just that.\n\nIs the overall cost of the party to other contributors growing with each guest?

We did have disagreements about who to invite but not that many since it was popular for us to invite people to the reception only (after dinner) so there was no cost.  (Open bars were not a thing either).\n\nAnother big discussion we had was how to address the invitations.  My mother was adamant that the proper way was to send them to \"Mr. and Mrs. Bill Smith\".  I argued that using Mrs Bill Smith was antiquated and misogynistic, and there's no way I was using that formula.  It would be Mr Bill Smith and Mrs Rita Smith.  And going forward, I was not ever to be referred to as Mrs John Doe either.  I was Mrs Jane Doe!", "It might just be me, but it really bothers me that the \u2018traditional\u2019 wording had the husband\u2019s full name and the wife was an accessory.
