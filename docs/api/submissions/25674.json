I've heard a lot of people tell stories when they do their speeches at AA and NA! The things that happen to them when they were little and they're parents were addicts, or to their children while they were using are absolutely horrifying!\n\nYou have no idea what is happening to that child when you're not there. She might not even know what's happening to her own child! Especially if she's passing out! I 100% do not think you should ever give your sister money.

We all had a pretty negative childhood which of course the cycle continues. I'd love to help break it but I don't think I'm in a position to do a better job myself so I do feel guilty judging from the outside but on the other hand I never decided to have kids. She loves her she just really struggles with her behaviour sometimes and doesn't know what to do so when the ipad doesn't work it gets hard for her. My experience with the father was he never left his room and wouldn't participate in anything. Even going to the shops she had to put her at the neighbours house. I don't want to deal with all of this at my house. I'm already in a vulnerable position myself.", "I know it\u2019s her niece and family, but taking in a child or even sending money is a big commitment"]}
