She'll get better when (if) she wants to, but until that time you need to distance yourself from her.", "NTA-You had me in the first paragraph.  You need to worry about making sure you and your wellbeing and finances are good before you can even think of having the capacity to handle not one but two people and their issues.  Your post says you are not so the answer is No with no additional explanation required.", "NTA block her and her some peace", "NTA and quit giving her money! What happens if she overdoses after you give her money? Just stop that! Make it as hard as possible for her to get more of whatever she's using.

From my experience cps isn't much different.", "Others have offered them a place to stay but when she couldn't make sales due to having no car and they said no guests could come she didn't want to stay there. There isn't much other family we try to help for a few hours at a time, I think when she starts school it will be less stressful for her as it won't be full time any more.", "That might not be enough if her mother is an addict. Could you take the daughter? At least you\u2019d get some money from the state to help with her care? Is the father horrible as a parent?", "That's what you think, but that's not necessarily what's true! Look I'm an alcoholic and I've been in the rooms for... Oh hell, since 2002! I've heard a lot of people tell stories when they do their speeches at AA and NA! The things that happen to them when they were little and they're parents were addicts, or to their children while they were using are absolutely horrifying!\n\nYou have no idea what is happening to that child when you're not there. She might not even know what's happening to her own child! Especially if she's passing out! I 100% do not think you should ever give your sister money.

We all had a pretty negative childhood which of course the cycle continues. I'd love to help break it but I don't think I'm in a position to do a better job myself so I do feel guilty judging from the outside but on the other hand I never decided to have kids. She loves her she just really struggles with her behaviour sometimes and doesn't know what to do so when the ipad doesn't work it gets hard for her. My experience with the father was he never left his room and wouldn't participate in anything. Even going to the shops she had to put her at the neighbours house. I don't want to deal with all of this at my house. I'm already in a vulnerable position myself.", "I know it\u2019s her niece and family, but taking in a child or even sending money is a big commitment", "YTA for giving her rides and money.\nAre you trying to $!(( her?", "NTA and stop giving her money.

You and your kitties need a safe place.", "Didn\u2019t even read it. Title alone makes it an easy NTA.", "As someone who has had addicted family members, you are absolutely NTA. You have to put yourself first in this case, and from my experience I wouldn\u2019t even let her in the front door to visit.", "NTA. It\u2019s important to keep your safe space safe. The fact that your sister is a user is enough reason to not have her in your home. When you have someone living with that have issues like that it will eventually put you in a heightened sense all the time and will be impossible to relax. After awhile you will feel stressed all the time. It will be detrimental for your overall health.", "Only being yelled at.  Hell, that's totally fine.  Emotional abuse doesn't exist at all and doesn't harm children. /s\n\nFfs.  Listen to yourself.  That poor kid.", "I definitely understand where you're coming from! I know my sister loves her daughter she's just caught up in her own head so just gives her the ipad or TV and gets frustrated when that stops working. I think when she starts school it will be less pressure for her. \nMum definitely is not an option. Only family was mentioned above to take them both in but she didn't accept their offer.", "Watching the violence, horror, gore, & sexual depravity in R rated movies & TV shows can mess a child's head up for YEARS, and there's no way mommy is supervising her shows adequately while she's getting high. Internet predators are thrilled to find kids desperate for adult attention left unsupervised on the Internet, which is exactly where your niece is headed (if she isn't there already). School isn't guaranteed to be a refuge; in fact it might quickly become a nightmare for a child with delayed social skills from lack of practice & who expects to be handed a screen every time she screams. And teaching her child to steal & shoplift is one short step from what your sister is already doing herself.\n\nThis is NOT about your sister \"just yelling\" at her. This is about a serious pattern of neglect. Calling CPS is a gamble but so is leaving your niece in her current risky home situation.", "NTA, as a sister of someone with issues they have to hit rock bottom before they see they need to change.  Think about if you take two people in, feed them, clothe them, pay for all thier needs.  How many times will you be able to miss work because your sister doesn't come home and you have her child to look after.  Are you willing to have her dealer show up demanding money? Are you ready to get evicted when she brings drugs into your apartment?", "NTA for not wanting to help  you can't help others til you help yourself  She will never get better if you guys keep bailing her out... I was a bad addict and my dad had to send me 1500 miles away to my mom to get better but that was after 4 OD and rock bottom. It has to happen sometime. I'm sorry your going through this. But do try to help your niece.", "NTA. If you let her move in she will never leave. Don\u2019t give her anymore money for drugs either.", "NTA...and as someone who has seen relatives deal with addiction issues since I was a small child DO NOT LET HER MOVE IN WITH YOU! Under no circumstances; you will regret it and it might end up being a financial and emotional breaking point for you, so don't do it.", "NTA she\u2019ll just bring chaos into your serenity", "That you think that verbal abuse isn't real abuse makes me sad.", "Please be careful with your niece. Who knows what bad people she may be introduced to or left alone with. Try to find someone who can take the kiddo in if possible. But your sister should stay with the family who place limits. That\u2019s safer for everyone. \n\nNTA.", "I didn't say verbal abuse wasn't real abuse. \nBeing yelled at is different to being abused. She is telling her to stop running  stop jumping, yelling her name etc. She is not calling her names, abusing or threatening her in any way shape or form.\n It is just how she treats unwanted behaviour. 'Hey stop running!' Is what I mean. She just yells it and it annoys me because I like quiet. That is why I mentioned it.\n\nIn my experience verbal abuse constitutes as much more than just being yelled at for being naughty. \nShe just shouldn't yell at her as much,  because then when she does need to be yelled at, she laughs at her. which is why I included it as the post it frustrates me and I don't want it in my house and I would treat her differently but she is not my child. \nThe household we grew up in displayed real abuse, emotional, verbal and physical.  I would have stepped in if this was real. She is loved and cared for my sister just struggles when the ipad doesn't keep her distracted and she wants to play up.", "NTA, you have to do what's best for you.  A lot of my clients are active in their addiction and I know how difficult they can be.  I also know how mean and manipulative they can be when wanting money from their loved ones.  Keep a list of resources to redirect her to any time she asks for something.  Don't feel bad for looking out for yourself.", "NTA, I have a brother who is a lot younger than your sister but definitely tends to end up jobless and homeless due to his drug addiction. I got guilted into taking him in and it was living hell. He just stole most anything not locked up or bolted down. When he eventually left after police intervention, he tried telling the police about drugs in my room that I stashed. The cops didn't believe him but, it really was the last horrible fuck you he did to me. Don't let an addict move into your place under any circumstances.", "Being yelled at is different to being abused.

Your drug addicted sister is not capable of providing a sane living environment and you know it.  Read what you wrote about her lifestyle and understand that it is undoubtedly causing harm to your niece. You must feel conflicted about your need for stability and the opportunity to help her and so you minimize the chaos she is enduring. Is there anyone to take that kid in?", "Ok, that's fair.  I retract my snark.  Apologies.", "Call CPS ffs.", "Yes you're absolutely right, It is causing some harm to her development of course.\nAside from calling authorities there would be no other suitable carer in our family that would be acceptable for it. I'm conflited because that would mean us aunties would lose our visits with her which we try to maintain to be there for her. Only other option would be a foster family but she has behavioural issues. It would be a hard journey for her coming from being an only child.", "I think you need to go back and read what you wrote.  You absolutely should not prioritize the hours you get to visit with your niece over her 24/7 existence.  \n\nYour niece is being neglected, full stop.  The yelling is not the same as physical abuse but it\u2019s breaking her psyche in ways that take far longer to heal.  \n\nI think what would be best would be to involve social services and then qualify for placement and receive the financial assistance to raise your niece.  Hopefully losing parental rights will snap your sister out of it and motivate her to take the steps needed to sober up.\n\nIf you can\u2019t or won\u2019t do that, then your niece is better off in foster care than with her biological family.  Don\u2019t prevent her from having a safe, stable household just because you wouldn\u2019t get your auntie visits when you want them.", "NTA, you need to make sure you are healthy and well in order to help other people.", "NTA my step-sister has a drug problem as well and I absolutely would not let her live with me. If she wanted to get clean and could accept boundaries that\u2019s one thing. But her only asking for money and refusing to live with someone who sets boundaries means she has no intention of getting clean and getting her life on track. You are protecting yourself", "Of course you can't have an active drug addict who lies and manipulates family, steals and scams, living with you.  Say no, and feel zero guilt.\n\nThe person I'm worried about here is the 5 year old.  It's hard to imagine that your sister, as you've described her, is taking adequate care of this child.  I wonder if there's someone else in the family who could take care of this child, at least while your sister is still using drugs.  It sounds like you're struggling right now, but is there another sibling, an aunt, or a grandparent who could provide this child with a home?\n\nIf not, as a last resort if the child is actually unsafe, please call DCS.  Don't allow this child to be abused or dangerously neglected.\n\nNTA", "NTA Do not give in. She will use you for everything you have, time and money. And once you stop being useful you will be disregarded. The addiction has taken over, your sister might be in there, but she is not in charge. Do not let her use your niece as a guilt trip either. The only reason she took her is likely that she can score pity points and use her own kid to get people to support her.\n\nIf anything report her to CPS.", "Emotional abuse can take many forms, and yelling at your child and having the attitude that you want your kid to leave you alone is *absolutely* child neglect and emotional abuse. I literally have PTSD because of the shit that my family's done to me, and I still get triggered if anyone raises their voice at me (thankfully, this doesn't happen now that lost of my family isn't in context with me).\n\nIf you're a child and you have a parent that just starts screaming whenever they get frustrated, or whenever they're upset about something else, it's impossible to feel safe around that parent. You never know what to expect from them, and the slightest thing (including imaginary issues) can set them off. The person who is supposed to protect you and keep you safe is a source of fear, anxiety and even danger.\n\nI'm not saying that CPS should take away her kids, but mandating therapy for mother and daughter (not together) would be good. I dunno if that's a thing, but yeah. That's gonna be one fucked up kid.\n\nSure, you might have gone through worse than this child is going through, but that doesn't mean that they aren't being abused. My childhood involved >!false imprisonment, medical neglect that almost killed me several times, parents who thought that they could harass me and beat me to cure my learning disorders, drowning (once), theft...!< All sorts of insane stuff. You still won't see me telling people that anything less serious than my own experiences doesn't count as a heavy dose of abuse or trauma. This stuff isn't a competition, but any amount of abuse on a regular basis is really damaging, especially if it takes place during your formative years.", "Jesus christ, what the hell is wrong with you? Just call cps like a normal person.", "Where do you think these 'behavioural issues' stem from? Could they have anything to do with having an active addict for a mother?"]}
