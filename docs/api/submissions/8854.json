Right before any visit, my mom like all was only comes to me not to start drama with my brothers family. She even told my newly wife not to start drama, but doesn't tell the same story to the other family.\nBit of back story, my sister in law is one of those people that will say the nastiest thing to you but in a polite manner. My mom has known about how I can't stand her and her comments.\nGetting back to the story, they are in town and we being family go to visit. We brought our female husky over for the girls to play but all they did was run and scream when the dog ran past them. But they got mad and called our dog bad because she didn't listen to you. So as usual the SIL is talking behind our backs about our dog to my mother. Mom didn't say anything to SIL so me and wife leave. Parents wondering why and we told them that the SIL doesn't like our dog so we are leaving. \nOn sunday,Just me and the wife go to parents house for mother's day lunch. Brothers family still there, me and the wife were still upset about yesterday but we moved forward and tried to ignore the SIL. As the day went on the girls would only play Christian music and it made me and my wife uncomfortable listening to the music so we had Alexa to stop the music. I stepped outside to vape because I needed the nicotine, as my wife was getting asked left right and center about why she isn't Christian. My wife came to me and told me what was going on. She stepped outside because she was so flustered. So I tried to have a conversation with the 7Y. When I walked up to her and said I need to talk to you. The 7Y replied back saying I'm not going to listen to you. At that point the SIL yelled at me saying I will not talk to her kids like that, and then I lost all patience and yelled back saying you will not talk bad about my wife anymore, mind you keeping the curse words out because the kids. But me and my wife left again not saying bye to any family.

Just take a look at the way you are reacting here, if you do that irl also you are not likeable and people react to the way you behave.", "YTA. Honestly, you and your wife sound very high-maintenance and dramatic. Not everyone is going to love your dog, FFS. Not liking the music fine, but you should not be addressing the  seven year old with your grievances - you should have spoken with her mother first before attempting to confront her.", "So let me get this...\n\n\n1. You brought an untrained dog to \"play with the girls\" but the girls were scared because the dog wouldn't listen.\n2. You then leave in a huff yet return the next day knowing they were still there visiting. \n3. You then both you and your wife get upset over the CHILDREN listening to music so you stop them from doing so.\n4. You then decide to try and confront the 7yo because your wife was flustered.\n\n\nNo wonder your SIL talks crap about you, if it kept you away from me and my kids I'd do it daily and loudly.\n\n\nYTA", "YTA stop causing drama", "YTA. Your mother has to tell you and your wife not to start drama... because you clearly love to start drama. LOL. \n\nYou get mad because two little kids didn't like your dog. So you dramatically leave the gathering. \n\nYou get mad because two little kids play Christian music. So you proceed to turn the music off (rude as hell, it's not your house and they're not your guests, but your mother's. If she wants the music on, then it stays on). \n\nYour wife gets upset because two little kids ask her questions about her religion. So you proceed to... try and address the issue with the little kids?! All you had to do was tell the parents to make sure their children don't question your wife about the topic anymore. \n\nYou got told not to be aggressive to two little kids (and rightly so), so you yelled and then dramatically left, again. \n\nThe fact you can't see how the only problematic people here are you and your wife, makes everything a bit funnier.", "YTA - You brought dogs to someone else's house... Did you ask permission? It's not out of the realm of possibilities that small children might be scare of a big dog, especially if they aren't around large dogs normally. Then you get all butt hurt because they called your dog a bad dog for not listening and decided to leave. Then the next day you don't like Christian music so you turn it off. And instead of dropping it and moving on, you decide to try to chastise a child over them listening to music. Your SIL didn't like how you were speaking to her child and tells you that, and instead of understanding because you had the same situation except it was a dog, you decided to yell at her about talking bad about your wife. And at no point in the story did you say that they talked bad about your wife. You've only said that they asked her why she isn't a Christian. IDK unless there's more to this story it points to you being the asshole.", "ESH", "YTA.\n\nThe kids didn't like your dog. That's life - not everyone likes dogs, especially not big dogs like huskies. It doesn't exactly sound like you had the dog under control. \n\nYou didn't like the music so you turned it off...kinda rude, it's not your home so generally you should ask before doing this. The kids were bothering your wife with their questions- perfectly valid, so address it with their parents. Don't take it up with a 7 year old, that's ridiculous. \n\nI can kinda see why your mother told you not to start stuff because it comes across as you and your wife looking for things to be offended by.", "What were you trying to talk to the 7-year-old about?   as for being berated for not being Christian, I would just tell them to shut up about their fantasy life. I wouldn't tell Alexa to stop the music though; their house, their music.", "NTA\n\nAnyone with a bit of brains knows a dog wil run and not play when kids will only scream and run.\n\nTheir kids are not brought up right if the first thing they say is \"I'm not going to listen to you\".\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone saying you are the A is probably Christian and get over the fact that you are not.", "YTA. If you feel this way. Don't go anyplace SIL is. The 7Y replied back saying I'm not going to listen to you. The adults already told them you don't matter. LC with mom and No contact of any kind with SIL and her family. Stop with the drama.", "God, this gave me a headache, trying to comprehend what's going on. There's absolutely no structure to the post", "I think this is more of a YTA.\n\n1. It sounds like perhaps your nieces are a bit scared of dogs and like your husky doesn't necessarily have a good recall. That would understandably bother your SIL if your dog will not leave her children alone. \n\n2. The music is a bit whatever, but you're also at someone else's house who seems to be okay with playing that music for the girls. You could have politely asked to change/turn off the music. \n\n3. Your wife being flustered about the Christianity convo is completely fair but you address that with the adults in the room, not a 7 year old. Children that grow up in a faith based family often don't understand *why* someone else practices a different faith or none at all. They're not intending to be rude or mean, they're kids and they're curious. \n\nI can understand why your mom asked you not to kick things off. It sounds like you've made up in your mind that you're the black sheep of the family when in reality, it's likely that you have an inflated sense of people being against you.", "Sounds like mom was right for asking you not to cause any drama, and YTA for not honoring her request especially on Mother's Day of all days.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Also, why would you bring an animal somewhere without checking with the other attendees first?\n\n>girls would only play Christian music and it made me and my wife uncomfortable listening to the music so we had Alexa to stop the music\n\nSo, again, you took it upon yourselves to make decisions for EVERYONE without so much as a conversation, like \"Hey, can we listen to something else?\"\n\n>When I walked up to her and said I need to talk to you\n\nNo, absolutely not.  You handle issues with adults, not the 7 year old child.", "You brought an unexpected dog to someone's house first visit and second visit you turned off an their Alexa. Honestly you sound like a terrible guest. YTA", "YTA. You failed to train your dog. Then took it to someone else\u2019s house. Why would two young girls want to play with an untrained dog. Clearly you and your wife cause drama since you had to be warned not to\n\nWhat were you even planning to talk to the 7 year old about? That her parents and grandparents allowed her to choose the music until you rudely just turned it off. Or that she ignored your poorly trained dog?", "ESH\n\nMy knee jerk reaction was that you're the AH. But I think I'll go out on a limb here instead. \n\nFirst things first. Leave your dog at home. It doesn't need to go everywhere with you.\n\nSecondly, you don't get to just turn off music in someone else's home. That's so utterly rude. \n\nHowever...your SIL shouldn't allow her children to pester people about their religion either so she's partially to blame imo. She should have interjected into that conversation way before you tried to discuss it with the child. She should have either distracted the kid from the topic entirely or just shut it down. \n\nSo thirdly, don't attempt to parent someone else's child. \n\nHonestly, I think you and your wife should just stay home when they're visiting.", "Yes I clearly hate my Christian family. Thanks", "You completely missed the entire story but ok have a nice day.", "My thoughts exactly. \n\nI think they can all use some communication lessons.\n\nESH", "I totally agree. Bringing a dog over who has maybe not met these children before and maybe the kids have not had much experience around dogs was not a smart thing to do.", "It was grandma's house, not the in-laws'.", "Same thoughts I actually add more context in one of the comments", "I wanted to talk and explain that's not appropriate", "It doesn't say anywhere the dog is untrained...small children running around will excite the dog whether trained or not", "Well you said your SIL was passive aggressive, you got freaked out by Christian music and your wife didn't like being asked why she wasn't Christian. \nYou were annoyed by the kids not liking your dogs, what music they played, then tried to confront one of them. \nYour words. \nLet's rephrase- you appear to clearly dislike your Christian family.", "Are you here to get judgments or are you here for people to tell you that you are right?  From what I could tell, the other commentor register the same way that I did. You had an unleashed dog that scared little kids. And then you\u2019re mad that those same kids are playing Christian music. That\u2019s YOUR hangup. \n\nTypically, Christian music is fairly mild in terms of the style of music and the tempo, etc. It\u2019s not like thrash metal, which is loud and jarring or rap, which has a lot of curse words and violence.", "Well you clearly didn't tell it properly because u had the same reaction as the above OP", "The fact that your mother had to do this:\n\n>my mom like all was only comes to me not to start drama with my brothers family. She even told my newly wife not to start drama\n\nproves that my assessment is correct.", "No I think they were very accurate", "They're not your child. Speak to their mother about it. What you did was not appropriate.", "That would also be very inappropriate", "They said the dog didn\u2019t listen. That is called untrained", "The OP said that the dog wasn't listening to them, so I think that's where the \"untrained\" bit is coming from.", "Nobody in their right mind likes being asked why they aren't Christian, just accept the fact not everyone has the same belief system and stop pushing it down their throats.", "1. We never said freaked out yours words sir.\n2. The kids liked dogs and even had a golden retriever just didn't know how to act around other dogs\n3. Lastly how else are you to teach someone if you don't confront the issue", "Ok let me explain it this way and maybe you might understand.\nI'm not looking for Justification for my actions. If I'm the asshole, I want a fair understanding of why.\n\nSo starting over maybe with more context.\n\nThe reason my mom comes to me is because she knows what my SIL does and says is horrible but still allows it to carry on and sweep it over the rug. This has gone on for about 5 years, and still nothing done about the situation.That is why she comes to use and everyone around. Waring them about what the SIL does and says and doesn't want anything to start because of what she says and do.\nThe dog situation, my wife is a professional dog trainer and our dog was being playful as usual, and the kids were \"having fun\" it's just we heard the comments the SIL was making about our dog. Made you we look at our dog as a kid of our own. So instead of starting drama we left. The only reason we came back on Sunday was what little respect I had for my mother on mother's day.", "How?", "Not necessarily, if the environment is too noisy and the small children are still running around it will choose not to listen. I have a fully trained dog and having small children around excites her it takes a fair few tries to get her to listen, and that's being fully trained", ">They're not your child.\n\nHow is it that you need this explained to you at your age?", "Because you confronted a 7 yo child instead of their parents?", "You wanted to explain that what wasn't appropriate? Playing Christian music? Because if so that's not something to tell a child is inappropriate, and is actually the most appropriate music that they can listen to besides kid songs (which I'm sure you also wouldn't have wanted to hear). You don't want to listen to it then you turn it off and have a conversation with the parents.", "Then they shouldn\u2019t be allowing the dog off leash to run past children who clearly were uncomfortable", "Why should the dog be punished?", "Being kept on a leash isn't a punishment FFS. The dog also didn't have to attend, since they left them at home during the next visit.", "The dog isn\u2019t being punished. Clearly if the environment is too noisy and small children are running around and the dog isn\u2019t listening, this is a sign of sensory overload. The dog needs a calm space. Being on a leash with understandable boundaries is not a punishment at all", "What punishment??", "The dog was joining in with the children running around, so being put on a leash for having fun is seen as a punishment for the dog, which is unfair to them seeing as all they are doing is exactly what the children are doing. As stated in the OP, they brought the dog with them for the children to play with and all they did was scream, a dog will see that as excitement and will carry on.", "Being put on a Leash is punishment, no matter what you say.\n\nSure they need a calmer environment when having a \"sensory overload\" but being put on a leash does not do that. They did the right thing by leaving.", "Your being put on a leash, must stay in one spot, while others are screaming and running.\n\nTry it and see how you feel."]}
