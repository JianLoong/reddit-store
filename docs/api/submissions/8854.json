My mom has known about how I can't stand her and her comments.\nGetting back to the story, they are in town and we being family go to visit. We brought our female husky over for the girls to play but all they did was run and scream when the dog ran past them. But they got mad and called our dog bad because she didn't listen to you. So as usual the SIL is talking behind our backs about our dog to my mother. Mom didn't say anything to SIL so me and wife leave. Parents wondering why and we told them that the SIL doesn't like our dog so we are leaving. \nOn sunday,Just me and the wife go to parents house for mother's day lunch. Brothers family still there, me and the wife were still upset about yesterday but we moved forward and tried to ignore the SIL. As the day went on the girls would only play Christian music and it made me and my wife uncomfortable listening to the music so we had Alexa to stop the music. I stepped outside to vape because I needed the nicotine, as my wife was getting asked left right and center about why she isn't Christian. My wife came to me and told me what was going on. She stepped outside because she was so flustered. So I tried to have a conversation with the 7Y. When I walked up to her and said I need to talk to you. The 7Y replied back saying I'm not going to listen to you. At that point the SIL yelled at me saying I will not talk to her kids like that, and then I lost all patience and yelled back saying you will not talk bad about my wife anymore, mind you keeping the curse words out because the kids.

The music is a bit whatever, but you're also at someone else's house who seems to be okay with playing that music for the girls. You could have politely asked to change/turn off the music. \n\n3. Your wife being flustered about the Christianity convo is completely fair but you address that with the adults in the room, not a 7 year old. Children that grow up in a faith based family often don't understand *why* someone else practices a different faith or none at all. They're not intending to be rude or mean, they're kids and they're curious. \n\nI can understand why your mom asked you not to kick things off.

As stated in the OP, they brought the dog with them for the children to play with and all they did was scream, a dog will see that as excitement and will carry on.", "Being put on a Leash is punishment, no matter what you say.\n\nSure they need a calmer environment when having a \"sensory overload\" but being put on a leash does not do that. They did the right thing by leaving.", "Your being put on a leash, must stay in one spot, while others are screaming and running.\n\nTry it and see how you feel.", "YTA. Thanks for being very honest in your post. Most OPs leave a lot out and it's obvious there is a whole different perspective being left out. You need to apologize to your sister. Apologize for not being nice to the kids, for bringing your dog, and for not being nice in general. \n\nDon't. Discuss.Religion. Nobody is going to change their religion for you. Nobody is going to respect your beliefs. It makes people defensive and angry. Stop it. \n\nYou should also Apologize to your mom. \n\nIf you feel uncomfortable, just say it's time for you to go, say your kind goodbyes, and thanks for having us over... and leave. No need for yelling or dramatic flouncing out the door. \n\nNext time, you should invite everyone to an event that is on neutral turf. Perhaps invite them to 4th of July parade or something. \n\nMy brothers are Tin-hatters, and one is Fringe Religious, and they have raised their 8 kids that way. I'm glad I live in another state and only text with them, send their little kids gifts, and see them every few years. My husband is good at being a buffer when he sees I'm getting uncomfortable. \n\nWatch youtubes on how to set and maintain healthy boundaries with family.

It sounds like your brother and SIL are more in line with your Mom's way of life and you and your wife feel left out. You bring your dog who misbehaves and stop the music the children want to listen to. I wonder if the question about not being a Christian was a simple one that upset your wife. Also, your Mom having to ask you to behave makes me think that this isn't the first time you stirred up trouble.", "There's a reason you get a talking to before visits. YTA", "YTA.

Why are you engaging with your brother and his family when it\u2019s obvious that these relationships are toxic?  Step away from these inevitable conflicts and only visit your mom when your brother, SIL and nieces are not around.", "YTA. When your mother has to ask you (and only you) to not start drama before a family gathering, that\u2019s pretty telling, and the rest of your story confirms why she feels compelled to do so. \n\nI\u2019m not Christian, and don\u2019t like Christian music. But your wife being so \u201cuncomfortable\u201d by the music, to the point where you turned it off while others were enjoying it seems extreme. Do you normally live in a bubble? \n\nMore importantly, you and your wife displayed a lack of emotional maturity to understand that kids are not adults. First, you were upset by their reaction to the dog. Then, your wife became offended by a child\u2019s questions, and you came in to save her or something by having a \u201ctalk\u201d with said child. \n\nI have a feeling these kids could be annoying as hell, based on some of things they said. But they are kids. You continued to make every little thing a huge deal, and then when you really did something wrong, and were understandably called out, you dramatically left.", "Yta. You brought a loud, excitable dog to someone else's party, where it scared small children, then got offended because the mother of this kids, whose job is to protect those children, complained to her hostess about the dog that as upsetting her kids. The dog that should have been left elsewhere instead of being taken to an environment where it was guaranteed to be overstimulated, and become over boisterous, which is a problem where there are kids who could very well be hurt by accident by said dog.\n\nYou then get offended by the music in someone else's house, and so turn it off (rude), and then your wife complains about not being able to defend her own beliefs, and so you decide to confront one of the smallest and youngest people present. Why would you confront the children, and not the adults? That's massively inappropriate. You come across as a bully, a reasonable person takes it up with the adults, not against a powerless child.", "Yta. Are you guys like 14 or something?", "YTA - I have a husky, she's amazing, very quiet in the house with us, basically a cat. However, I wouldn't bring her to my family's house without permission or around small children. She can be clumsy, huskys generally have terrible recall and when excited she jumps and can accidentally injure kids. Either way, a small phone call to ask if the dog could come would have been ideal or simply not bringing it would have been ok too, you don't need to bring it everywhere and not everyone needs to or will like your dog.\n\nRegarding the music, you could have just asked to change it instead of stopping it yourself. It wasn't your home so who are you to make unilateral decisions. Also, it's just music, you could have ignored it.\n\nFor the christian conversation with wife, it's not for you to go up to a child and tell him to quit the christian talk with your wife. You and your wife should have spoken to SIL and brother and asked them to stop.\n\nI know how hard it can be to deal with people who make snarky comments or that we generally don'T like but sometimes for the good of everyone it'S better to just keep quiet and let live, unless it's really an issue like the christian talk. It jsut seems like you are extremely entitled (perception from what you wrote), the dog, the music, the conversation, etc. We are not always going to be put in ideal situations regarding choice of music and conversation but there's no need to get into a fight over it. Try and find some middle ground or some diplomacy in all this.", "YTA\n\nYour mom told you not to start drama.  That statement tells me everything I need to know for the reminder of your write up.  Did you ask to bring your dog or did you just show up with a dog?  What gives you or your wife the right to stop playing music that was played?  Why do you think you can talk to a 7 year old about things without discussing it with their parents first? \n\nFrankly, you and your wife sound very entitled here, and your mom's comment supports this assumption.", "What was he trying to have a conversation about with the 7 yr old?", "Yta. Why would you take your dog without being asked to or asking beforehand if you can. \nI'm not christian but I wouldn't have a problem with children playing their music. \nYou should have spoken to the adults.", "YTA. \n\nYou confronted a 7 year old about asking about religion. Your automatically the AH. \n\nYou speak to the parents. \n\nThe fact your mum comes to you and also warned your wife off tells me you are both highly strung AH.", "YTA. \n\nWhich is weird, because I would have thought a post about kids AND christians would have definitely put me on your side. \n\nDid you ask the kids if they wanted to meet your dog? No, and clearly the kids don't like dogs. That doesn't make them assholes. Your mom didn't say anything to SIL because the dog WAS bothering them, you left with the dog, which is what you should do when it is clear people don't want to be around your dog. \n\nNext, playing Christian music all day would annoy me too. When you stopped it, there was no fight, it was just stopped. So great, problem solved. Plus, you were at someone else's home, so the polite thing to do would be to ask the host to change/stop the music, and if they refuse, then you either put up with it or leave. In this case, you were slightly rude to stop the music, but no one raised a fuss about it, so not sure what you are complaining about. \n\nAnd ya, having people ask you about your religion and trying to convert or shame you is annoying. But what exactly were you going to talk to the 7 year old about? I can't imagine you approaching that conversation with any type of love or reasonableness, and the kid nailed it when they said they don't need to talk to you, because they don't. Kids can be annoying about all sorts of things, and while I agree being annoying about religion is particularly grating, you either talk to their parent about asking them to stop, or you ignore it. You don't approach a 7 year old, tell them \"we need to talk\" and then expect everyone to just be fine with you what....telling the kid they are rude, not to talk about religion? What conversation do you think you could have appropriately handle with a 7 year old when you can barely put together a coherent story on reddit?", "Paragraph. Learn it. Use it. Live it.

Why did you take a dog around kids who clearly don't know how to act around dogs.  That's a recipe for disaster.  Does your brother's family have dogs?    \n2. Why did you think it was ok to change the music in someone else's home?  Totally cool that you don't like Christian music.  Not cool that you think you can take control of Alexa and it's not even your own home.  \n3. If you have a problem with a 7 year old, you go to their parent.

Also it's not your house.  This is a you problem.  I would be upset if you tried to confront my kid for playing Christian music.

It can be utterly terrifying to a child to have this pushed at home and find out that people they love are apparently going to be tormented for all eternity.   \n\n\nSource:  was once that confused kid", "> If I'm the asshole, I want a fair understanding of why.\n\nThat's fair. You say your mom knows your SIL is horrible. But in the entire description of the day *you* provided, your SIL did nothing wrong.\n\nYou brought your dog unannounced to an event with *someone else's children*. It's obvious (by your own shock at their reaction to your dog) that you don't know how these children react to animals which are not their own. You don't know if they have phobias with certain breeds, if they're okay with dogs that jump up, if any of them have allergies to certain types of hair/dander, etc. It would be common courtesy to ask if it was acceptable to bring your dog over *prior to the event*. Doesn't matter if you look at the dog as if it's your child. It's not a child. It's an animal. OTHER people don't have to treat an animal as if it's a human child.\n\nEven if you did ask, and they agreed (doesn't sound that way in your post, but I could be wrong), it's inappropriate to bring your dog to a space which is not your own private property, or around other people, and allow the dog to run freely, if the dog will not listen to commands. (This part was unclear in your post. Your SIL says the dog did not listen. Why?) Your dog should not be playing with these children who are not your children if the dog will not stop when they tell it to. It doesn't matter if the children were having fun, or the dog was behaving within the realm of reason. That parent gets to decide if it's appropriate/safe for their child. \n\nAnd everyone has a right to hold their own opinion. Doesn't matter if wife is a dog trainer and thinks your dog is perfectly behaved. SIL has a right to disagree. Some might consider it rude to express that opinion the way she did, but others would not, and frankly, it's nowhere near assholish enough to justify the level of contention you display in your post.\n\nNext, the music. You do not have the right to turn off music in anyone else's home without permission. It's rude to turn off something someone else is listening to/watching even in your own home, without notice. You were entirely out of line here.\n\nYou most certainly do not have the right to censor the entertainment provided for *other people's children*. And the comfort of the children takes priority over the comfort of you/your wife who are adults, and can leave the room. \n\nIt's also childish that you were made so uncomfortable solely based on the music which children were listening to. They preaching or forcing their beliefs on you. They were listening to music. If you don't like it, don't listen. This was childish. Frankly, as someone who was raised around religious zealots and has a lot of associated trauma, I *still* find your reaction here absurd.\n\nI agree that in a normally functional family environment, children shouting \"I don't have to listen to you!\" would be rude. And that doesn't matter. First of all, even in that situation, you don't get to make the rules/expectations for other people's children. \nIn that situation, if you're hurt by their rudeness, you're an adult, and capable of walking away. You do not have the right to tell other adults how to parent, and you do not have the right to parent other people's children. Ever. EVER.\n\nAnd your family is not that normal functional family environment. Children DO NOT have to listen to every adult who attempts to talk to them. Not even if they are relatives. It's up to individual parents to decide who *their* children have to listen to. This parent has obviously decided her children are not required to listen to you. \n\nWhen an adult with no authority over a child attempts to assert authority, the children are well within their rights to assert their rights and their boundaries. ie: \"I don't have to listen to you.\" It's not rude, it's a statement of fact. You chose to ignore that fact, and that puts you squarely in the wrong.\n\n>as my wife was getting asked left right and center about why she isn't Christian. My wife came to me and told me what was going on. \n\nThis is a lil rude. Your wife should have asserted her boundaries. \"I don't feel this is an appropriate topic.\" and if those boundaries were asserted and ignored, left the situation. Which she did. If the people asking her were adults, then they were rude. If (as it seems from your phrasing) it was the children asking, this is natural curiosity for children, and was not rude. \n\n>So I tried to have a conversation with the 7Y. When I walked up to her and said I need to talk to you.\n\nNo. Absolutely not. You do not address other people's young children this way. If you felt the children had stepped over a line, and wished to establish your own boundaries, you should have addressed it to the parent(s). \n\nYou do not instruct other people's children.\n\nYou do not chide other people's children.\n\nYou do not interrogate other people's children. \n\nYour SIL had every right to react the way she did in this instance. I might not have been as calm as she was, in this situation. You definitely *would not* talk to *my* child like that.\n\n>The reason my mom comes to me is because she knows what my SIL does and says is horrible but still allows it to carry on and sweep it over the rug. \n\nHer house, her choice who she allows over. She chose to have SIL there. If what you're saying here is true, your mother asked you for help. She asked you to be the bigger person. You chose not to be. That's fine. You don't always *have* to be the bigger person. This part wouldn't make you the AH, on its own. But it certainly wasn't kind. Especially as a request from your mother for mother's day. I think it's really sad that while she's dealing with a house full of guests, her child could not give her the one thing she asked for: to simply not add to the drama. So yeah, the day, the request, it being in her home/not in a public place... also AH behavior.\n\nIf your SIL really is that horrible, normally, I can understand that you'd be frustrated, and react poorly. That's okay. It's normal and natural to make mistakes. To react poorly sometimes. To sometimes inadvertently be an AH. But at least own it when you do. There's a time and a place to address an on-going problem like this. This was not the time and place. Even if it was, you didn't actually address the problem. Nothing was resolved. Nothing has changed. Except... well... *you* spoiled your mom's day. Maybe that's okay with you. I get the feeling there might be some history with your mom, and maybe you don't feel she deserves much respect/consideration. I don't know the past, so I can't form an opinion on that. But ...\n\nfor everything else listed above, yes, most rational people would believe you'd been an AH. Repeatedly. Extremely. \n\nI hope that helps you to have a fair understanding of why you're getting the responses you are: YTA", "you literally said you wanted them to play with the dog but they just screamed instead and it wasn't listening????", "I'm sorry but your dog is not your child, it doesn't need to go everywhere with you and your wife's profession has nothing to do with it.

Not everyone likes having or wants dogs around.\n\nAnd yes I have a husky and cats and horses, and no, I don't bring my husky everywhere.", "Don\u2019t put your story on aita and be mad when people say that you are an asshole", "The Christian music I\u2019ve heard sounds mostly like soft rock or easy listening.

How lucky for you!", "i don't think anyone's arguing otherwise, nor was that the point being made that i responded to?", "Ok let me explain it this way and maybe you might understand.\nI'm not looking for Justification for my actions.

Leashing them teaches them that running around and barking as being naughty, this isn't bad behaviour, it's a dog's natural behaviour, barking to let everyone know they are having fun and running around for fun, exactly the same as the children were. Maybe if the parents explained this to the children they'd be able to understand the dog's natural behaviours and realise the dog is just having fun same as them.", "Being a dog \u201ctrainer\u201d doesn\u2019t mean the dog is fully trained.

I notice a lot of people in my environment do not teach this to their children anymore. When they see a dog across the street they are yelling and running, sometimes to try and excite the dog.

There are some people out there who have animals and claim to be a trainer, yet have no knowledge of what to do, the breed etc. I would always go to a certificated trainer and watch how they work with the animals before allowing them to work with my animals, but that's just me. A family member was a horse and dog trainer, one of the best I've ever seen, dogs listened straight away and loved her to bits brilliant with any age group no matter what, and the horses were amazingly well behaved around any aged person. Sometimes it's the owners that are the problem, but in this situation I don't think it was the OP at fault or his wife."]}
