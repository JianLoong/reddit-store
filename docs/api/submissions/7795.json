{"id": 7795, "submission_id": "10gfh3p", "title": "AITA for telling my husband thay his grandmother is not my responsibility?", "selftext": "My husband (39M) and I (37F) got into an argument because I told him that this family, OUR family is not responsible for his grandmother. He told me that I was selfish and I only cared about my needs only.\n\nThe problem is this argument was because I had a job interview to work at a hospital. It paid double than what I was getting in my previous job and would help us out greatly. The thing is we only own one car. I used to take the bus to my previous job alot but this time the hospital job is a 30 minute drive and I want to be there on time. My husband takes the car for him to go to work.\n\nThe issue was his mother called him to ask if we can take his grandmother to her doctor appointments on the same day of my interview. His mom \"could not take her\" because her excuse was that she had already made plans to meet up with her friends. So basically she prioritized her friends over her own mother.\n\nThe doctor appointment was scheduled an hour after my interview was scheduled and the clinic is at least an hour away (the grandma used to live in the area and is very adamant to keep going to that same doctor). When my husband asked he needs the car to take his grandmother to the appointment, I told him no because I need the car for the job interview. My husband suggested I take the bus since I already know how to use the routes and that I need to wake up earlier to arrive on time.\n\nI got super upset and told my husband that why should I risk the interview and that we really need the job so we don't have to struggle anymore? My husband then says that his grandmother's health is more important than money.\n\nWith that I told him that his family he married with and have children with is his responsibility and why does his mom get a free pass if \"health is more important?\"\n\nHe got upset and told me to do what I want and how selfish I was. He told his mother about the situation then I got a call from my MIL that I am a terrible wife and that family is important. I told her off and brought up that why is she not taking care of her own mom then? Her response was she doesn't want to fail her friend. Like seriously???\n\nSo my husband and his mom made arrangements that he would take his mom's car and drop his mom off with the friend and take his grandmother to the clinic while I take our car to the job interview. Since the my husband wouldn't speak to me and even sometimes ignore our kids. He even locks himself in his own office to play video games.\n\nAITA for prioritizing the job interview than my husband's grandmother's health?", "created_utc": 1674167690, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10gfh3p/aita_for_telling_my_husband_thay_his_grandmother/", "score": 106, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
