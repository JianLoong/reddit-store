It is a parents job to protect their child.", "NTA\n\nYou are just looking out for your kid.", "NTA but this really SHOULD NOT be a decision that you make for both of you, it should be something you and your partner agree on.  You may think she's worse than your partner thinks and that's an issue, but also if your partner doesn't agree with you and you just declare a Law About Grandma, you risk your partner thinking of you as overbearing and going behind your back.", "I think I need more info - when/why/how is she trying to use her mother as a babysitter? Is there another viable option? Do you care for the children alone as often as she does? Do you have money for an alternative option?

As the man in your relationship, it is up to you to make these decisions about who gets influence over your daughter. The grandma sounds abusive and it is your responsibility as a father to ensure the safety and security of your daughter.
