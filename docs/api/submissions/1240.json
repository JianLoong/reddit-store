He travels for work when he is gone ,he is gone for about a week, but when he is here it\u2019s usually 4 days to two weeks he is around. We have a lot of pets and my stepson is over every weekend. My husband works hard and I do appreciate everything he does, however based on his actions I think he thinks he does not have to clean up after his son, the animals, or even himself.\nFor example, my dog has mega esophagus which mean he throws up. My husband will see a throw up mess that is clearly there and just not clean it. Mind you I have carpet so throw up will just sit in the carpet until I find it. When I confront him he claims he didn\u2019t see it. That\u2019s always the defense \u201coh sorry I didn\u2019t see it\u201d. It\u2019s funny because when his son pulls the same crap he gets really mad at him, but when I say hey just check next time apparently I\u2019m berating him. \nHe leaves his stuff everywhere his shoes and socks are always on the couch, I have pillows and blankets and decorative crap on the couch so I understand moving them to sit down however he throws every single one of them everywhere, like it seems intentional. The excuse is the same \u201csorry, I didn\u2019t see it\u201d.\nMy husband leaves cups on the counter, half empty water bottles everywhere, wrappers, never empties the trash can on his side of the bed. If I say anything I\u2019m berating him and he \u201cshuts down\u201d, I have abandonment issues so I think he gives me the silent treatment to punish me. When he comes home the house is clean, it\u2019s easy to keep things clean if everyone just picks up after themselves and I do all the deep cleaning. But as soon as he is home from work it\u2019s like a tornado went through my house and if I say anything I\u2019m berating him and making him feel bad.

I suggest you try out this other sub", "INFO: How far are you willing to push this? Are you willing to let his and stepson's mess lay where they dropped it and only clean up after yourself? It seems this has gone on for awhile and when you try to talk to him he says sorry or accuses you of berating and shuts down to avoid doing anything. \n\nI can only see 3 ways: \n\n1. Don't pick up after him/stepson and let it pile up until they are forced to deal with it. Clean only for yourself. \n2. Take your dog and leave. \n3. Tell him that if he is not going to help keep things clean, HE has to pay for a maid to do it. \n\nSee, he thinks because you don't work it's your job to clean up behind him & stepson. You have done so. He shuts down or makes excuses not to help so you've wasted your breath. \n\nNTA but I don't see any other way than above.

I actually did let the mess accumulate and it took us 4 days to clean the house. That helped for a bit. I think I\u2019m gonna do the maid thing"]}
