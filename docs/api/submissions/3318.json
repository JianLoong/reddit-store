{"id": 3318, "submission_id": "z5n9qg", "title": "AITA for telling my brother's GF that Christmas isn't the meal to be cheap?", "selftext": "I (47M) spend Christmas with my parents. My dad passed away earlier this year, so my brother (40M) and his GF (32F, I'll refer to her as Eve) have said they will cook for Christmas, Eve is the cook. It's their first Christmas with their infant son, so they are very excited for it.\n\nWhen I was visiting brother and Eve, they were talking excitedly about Christmas. This will be the first time Eve has cooked Christmas, and the first time she has ever cooked a turkey. Brother said they had already bought the turkey. I frowned as we always had a fresh turkey from the local butcher's, never a frozen turkey. Eve said that she had gotten a frozen turkey crown as it was cheaper and that they didn't need a large turkey with legs. She started talking through her plan, saying she had already bought turkey gravy mix as she didn't want to cook gravy from scratch, using tinned potatoes to make the roast potatoes, had already made stuffing balls and they are in the freezer. I know that she is struggling for money at the moment as she is on maternity leave and is not returning to her job as nephew has additional needs. I was appalled when she said that she was going to cook Christmas dinner at their house the day before and then bring it to mum's to heat up. Mum is unable to do stairs, so we have to go to her. Eve tried explaining that due to the cost of living going up, she didn't want mum to have the additional cost of cooking a Christmas dinner. They are having their own meal on the 24th, so Eve is cooking two dinners at once. I snapped at Eve. I told her that I know she was being frugal with not going back to work, but that Christmas dinner wasn't the meal for her to be cheap on. Especially mum's first Christmas after her husband died. I told Eve that if she wasn't prepared to make a fresh meal that wasn't full of frozen food that's god knows how old, then she shouldn't have offered to cook Christmas. Eve then left the room with nephew, saying she needed to feed him. My brother got annoyed with me, telling me that I was being rude. He said that he was the one paying for the Christmas meal. They had bought the turkey before dad died and had only gotten one big enough to feed them with leftovers. He had been the one that suggested including mum and I for Christmas to Eve. Eve had been making things like stuffing balls and her home made pigs in blankets in advance and using tinned potatoes was to make her life easier. He argued that Eve is the primary caretaker for nephew so she takes shortcuts when she is home alone with nephew so she could focus on him.\n\nMum has called me and had a go at me for making Eve cry, especially when I know that she's stressed from looking after nephew. Apparently she had taken nephew to go and cry upstairs, but I had no idea. I do feel bad that she got upset but at the same time, I don't think Christmas is the one meal to be cheap on. Am I the asshole?\n\nEdit: I have always and will be supplying the dessert and making a dairy free one for Eve. Me making the dessert was the agreement I had with my parents.\n\nEdit:  They aren't actually struggling. They can and do live comfortably on my brother's wage. We work in the same field and are paid well. They chose to live well below their means. \n\nOk, I am the asshole. I will call my brother in the morning to apologise and see if I can come around to apologise to Eve in person and I will offer to help her cook if she wants. I'm not going to turn up uninvited if Eve doesn't want to see me. I don't want to upset her more, she's a sweet girl and well suited with my brother.

Heres an idea instead of being rude and demanding an expensive meal offer to help her and offer to do some of the dishes yourself if you are so keen on it being perfect. You are being so selfish. She is a new mom and she has a huge pile on her plate taking care of an infant. You should be grateful for even being made a meal.

Or don't attend. \n\nBTW, Christmas dinner doesn't have to be a large expensive meal.

Why they do certain things and behave certain ways will suddenly make more sense. Perhaps that insight will help you help them one day.

I think you should ask yourself if there was some of that vulnerability in this response and if so, seek some support. There\u2019s a great book by Julia Samuels on grief which is British.
