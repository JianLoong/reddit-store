She uses the account to follow me because I live abroad and some cooking/baking accounts. She's of the mentality that women shouldn't upload  photos and if they do they should be ultra-modest. We're Middle Eastern and Muslim, but she's very socially conservative and can't seem to comprehend the fact that younger generations have changed. I have a cousin (28f) who is a newcomer Instagram influencer in my home country. She's a beautiful young lady and Im so proud of her for creating a decent source of income for herself. My mother disagrees and thinks she's exposing herself to harms way and the \"life of sin and danger\". My cousin lost both parents at a young age and her family, including my mother, hardly stepped in to provide any kind of support. Ive been abroad for over a decade and still helped my cousin out mentally and financially and we have a good relationship. \nMy mother added my cousin on her fake account and claimed to be a 40 yr old woman who knows me and follows my work (Im a journalist). I didn't know any of this and thought my cousin was aware of my mother's account. Last week my cousin asked me if I knew this woman and I told her it's my mom using a fake name. My cousin laughed and asked why she made up a whole character to talk to her. I didn't understand but I dropped it. Well my mom is calling me an AH for exposing and embarrassing her. I asked her why she hid her identity and she said \"I wanted to create a safe account and befriend your cousin so she can talk to me because she has no one. She's on a path of destruction and needs guidance so I pretended to be a woman closer to her age who can comfort her\". I told my mom that it's ridiculous she thinks someone like my cousin who is Instagram savvy wld open up to a complete stranger that is asking intrusive questions. She said well many ppl form friendships online. I said why not just be her aunt instead of trying to be her friend? My mon said she had a real account a while back but my cousin blocked her because she kept asking her if she had a boyfriend, and she'll be more comfortable talking about her personal life with a younger stranger than her aunt. I told my mom that's basically catfishing and creepy af. Even if her intentions were good in wanting to offer guidance, she overstepped. That she was never there when my cousin was orphaned but feels entitled to project her righteousness on a young woman making a name for herself. Mom got very upset and isn't talking to me. I think she needed to be called out but my dad and brother think I was too harsh.\n\nEdit: by influencer I mean my cousin does ads for products and restaurants, cafes, etc. She's in full dress code, but doesn't wear hijab. It's not like she's showing any skin though I would still support her if she did!", "created_utc": 1672057257, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvm2qe/aita_for_accidentally_exposing_my_mothers_alt/", "score": 632, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I don't care much for religions but there is merit to some of what they preach. \nCousin didn't do anything\nOP you telling your cousin it was you mom wasn't wrong. Though the way you're using catfishing is very open ended. There are many, many, \"fake\" people online but not all of them are out to hurt you. Some are shy, some have religious reasons, some have family reasons you can call them catfish but they aren't all bad. \nPersonally I prefer using catfish for devious people.

I forget too often that in a lot of cultures, what I do on an everyday basis are things that cause concern.", "If she us genuinely doing it becuase she feels morally superior then feel free to write her off. Moral superiority is pretty gross and I'm pretty sure most religions comdem that. \nIf she's being genuine just let your cousin (if she's okay with that) then let her down gently. If she becomes pushy though just put a full stop on her. \nYou'd know your mother best and if she speaks in a backhanded way or with a condescending tone you're probably right, and if she is doing it for selfish reasons I could agree with you.", "I don't see how it's a good place tbh.

We all have family members that still live as if it was 30years ago and do things that they believe are good even though by modern society\u2019s standards are not.

Maybe both?", "I think it's less religious motivated these days. Culturally conservative because she fears something my cousin would post would be  scandalous hence impact the family's reputation. By scandalous I mean wear a miniskirt or halter top.", "Maybe I didn\u2019t catch it, but while I know you said you\u2019re from a middle eastern family, do they live in the Middle East or are they transplants to the west? The only relevance of that is I\u2019m curious if the home country sees the same level of \u201csex sells\u201d advertising that the west does.  \n\nDo they cluck their tongues and wag their fingers at billboards like that or would they see it as normalized?", "I live in the West but my family is still there. I'm absolutely liberal in everything from dress to lifestyle but I don't share any of it online. Yes sex definitely sells there too but how influencers use sex in the west is extremely different than it's used over there. My cousin wears jeans and long sleeves in the ads she does with her hair done and nice makeup. That's also how a significant percentage of young women dress over there. Even hijab is becoming less prominent and more young women are choosing not to wear it.", "Thanks for the replies! Always curious how youths come to age in backgrounds dissimilar to my own."]}
