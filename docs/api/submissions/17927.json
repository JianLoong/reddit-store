Let them know that your fine with keeping it in the past, but if they ever try this again - even one peep - you will bring it up in front of everyone.

Its not your fault they got embarrassed by your reaction. I hope you enjoyed all your presents!", "NTA\n\nYou stated a boundary, they felt they had the right to ignore it, you reminded them they do not.

I seriously doubt the kids even cared since they had stuff to play with.

And make sure in your will you leave all your money and collectibles to that young relative who alerted you, with a spiteful note to the rest of your family.", "NTA and good for you for calling them out on their shit parenting.  Sounds as though your grandson is well behaved and knows the rules", "NTA. My parents bought me the usc falcon for my 40th birthday, they think it\u2019s fun that I started collecting Lego again as an adult. Lots of people collect stuff and everyone\u2019s collections are stupid to those that collect something else lol. I\u2019m sure even your mom collects glass figurines of moose or something.\n\nEdit: I do have toys of his own for when my nephew is over so it\u2019s easier for him to stay away from the Lego display cases.", "NTA, what\u2019s wrong with Toys at 50\u2026 you\u2019re allowed them and tbh most legos are made for adults too!", "NTA you did not go too far. good for you on calling them out. There is nothing wrong with getting collectible toys. They gain value when they are discontinued.  No one is entitled to anything that belongs to you. Just to ignore what you say and to go into a room in your house and try to give your collectibles to others is worse than disrespecting you. It is actually stealing which is what you said your parents did many times when you were young.", "NTA anyone thinking they can dictate to me what I do with my own things in my own home would find themselves outside the door with a \u2018friendly reminder\u2019 to get lost and not come back until they are ready to genuinely apologize and Never try to put their will above mine in my home or when dealing with my things.", "NTA. Your 5 year old grandson knows and respects your boundaries. It's a shame your parents don't. You didn't embarass them, their actions did. I'm sorry you had to have parents that didn't respect your things.", "NTA. They don\u2019t like that you have boundaries and in the grand tradition of narcissist assholes everywhere are now trying to cross them so you\u2019ll roll it back. Don\u2019t. They can be permanently disinvited from your home and life if they can\u2019t be respectful.", "NTA.\n\nAlso, get some ice cream for that 5 year old. We stan a prince.", "I would be no contact if that was my mom. NTA", "NTA, but your parents are! TRAUMATIZE YOUR PARENTS RIGHT BACK! Also, who goes into someone's private office and takes something without your permission? Your parents have boundary issues and still see you as a child. Tell them that if they can not respect your rules and ESPECIALLY not going into your space and taking your things then they can just not come to your house. It's not up to them to dictate to tou what you share and what you don't. The audacity!", "WTF are the parents thinking?  Not their gift.   Not their house.  Not their kids.  Not their birthday! OP NTA!", "NTA. I'm 53 and I love lego. I just built James Bond's Aston (I bought at Lego store at Disney), A Jedi Star Fighter my son got me for my birthday, and the Japanese skyline set. I consider them the same as plastic model cars and planes, etc.  \n\nThat must have sucked to see a present you got handed to someone else...good thing your grandson has your back!", "NTA. But you might reconsider having your parents visit.", "NTA.\n\n>When I was out back my mom went into my office and grabbed my new X-Wing set for the grandkids and great grandkids to play with. My grandson came and got me because he knows my rules. He is five. \n\n>I came into the house and took the box back before they got any of the bags out.\n\nI audibly gasped and was on the edge of my seat when I read this part and only exhaled when I saw that the bags hadn't been opened.  Those kits are not meant for little kids to play with.  Also that fact that your parents see no problem meddling in your life like that and deciding they know best when you're 50 and seem to know what's going on is ridiculous.  The fact that this opens up childhood trauma is just the shit icing on this shit cake.", "NTA.  Your folks gave you a shitty childhood.", "If he meant the newly released x-wing that thing is over $200 too.", "Can we call out his parents for literally mentally and emotionally abusing him aswell \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d NTA OP and my heart currently breaks for you!", "It was given to OP for him to enjoy, also X-Wing lego sets can be seriously expensive!", "Right?? I'm not a LEGO collector but I have friends that are and just the idea of taking this to give it to a kid is crazy.\n\nNever mind the fact OP \\*directly told her to leave it alone\\*. I sorry, but she was trying to take away something that belonged to OP so his story about having toys taken away when he was little was very relevant to the situation.", "NTA your parents are terrible parents.", "NTA - your mom sounds pretty awful.", "OP had his tub of miscellaneous legos to be played with.\n\nMeaning going into his office and stealing a new gift was way over the top!", "Great answer!", "I'm wondering whether it was only his toys that was given away, or was it his sister's too? Her response makes me think it was only his.", "Flowers on her birthday - then take them to your wife/to the hospital/to a cemetery - say it\u2019s bc \u201cflowers are for wives/patients/gravestones\u201d", "Also-side note- if parents and other people in your life don't want to be embarrassed by the way they treated you growing up, maybe they should have been better.", "It\u2019s was at his 50th Birthday party. Not Christmas.", "You know it's May, right? You know Christmas is in December, right?", "Because the parents are made of glass and might die from hearing a couple of truths", "NTA. Similar age and collect Lego as well.", "Can we also praise the Grandson who KNEW to get OP before shit got destroyed and saved the day and probably hundreds of someones dollars.", "You may appreciate this.\n\nAbout 10 years ago I was Christmas shopping and I was carrying a collectible Bat Man. A young guy in his 20s saw me and was telling his GF, \u201cI want one of those.\u201d She replied \u201cThat\u2019s for a kid.\u201d I turned and said \u201cThis is for a 45 year old man.\u201d\n\nThe now 55 year old man still gets collectibles, Legos, Hess Trucks and anything else that strikes him. And trust me, he ain\u2019t no kid.\n\nNTA. Enjoy your hobby.", "u/Creepy-Road-3172\n\nTotally off topic here but I'm dying to know..... what kind of planer did you get \ud83d\ude01", "Yea she has the kind of \u201coh it\u2019s not that bad\u201d attitude that makes me think she didn\u2019t experience it at all.", "That's so freaking petty. And I LOVE it! Be still my petty heart lol! \u2764\ufe0f", "It is? I operate by the Discordian calendar. But thanks for letting me know.", "I don\u2019t collect Lego but I\u2019ve bought my son a few of those really ridiculous sets (including a pirate ship for his birthday that I was up until 2 am building for him) so I know that if those bags were opened it\u2019s going to make it so much more difficult to build. They\u2019re in separate bags for a reason. They\u2019re age rated for a reason. \n\nNTA at all.", "I'm 41, I collect it through my son. It's all his but I do enjoy finding and building the retired / rare sets with him.\n\nLast year my husband got me the buildable Groot. My first and only set all of my own. I love him (Groot, and husband) and he's displayed, out of the sun, in my crafting room.", "Omg yesss! A 5 year old more respectful of rules and boundaries than OP'S own mother \ud83d\ude2d whole post had me crying", "I got a 3D printed Captain Rex helmet for my birthday. And new tools, air gun and paint to make it up with. I am a 41 year old woman. It was a gift from my 45 year old husband.\n\nYou enjoy your hobby too. Cos I sure as shit painted the fuck outta that. Looks like Rex just came back from Umbara.\n\nAnd no way anyone is touching it uninvited.", "I'm betting she's a golden child of sorts. I agree with you.", "You display your husband in your craft room?", "Right. My partner and I are into warhammer and he's really into collecting transformers. We also have a friend who does warhammer with us who has a 6 y/o who's also pretty good about rules cause he loves Legos but also has a 2 yo baby brother.", "Out of the sun. He's fine.", "Your friend is raising good kiddos \ud83d\ude2d now stop making me tear up I just finished wholesome crying \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude0d\n\nETA before I'm marked as a psycho or somethin- I have SERIOUS hormone issues right now lmao \ud83e\udd23 I cry at literally anything", "They are both very good kiddos. But the Legos need to remain contained when they are still a choking hazard for your baby brother.", "Also nose hazards. Learned that the hard way with my baby sister who would shove ANYTHING up her nose \ud83d\ude2d"]}
