Let them know that you're fine with keeping it in the past, but if they ever try this again - even one peep - you will bring it up in front of everyone.

I hope you enjoyed all your presents!", "NTA\n\nYou stated a boundary, they felt they had the right to ignore it, you reminded them they do not.

Knew about boundaries, rules and respect for property. Had the courage to go against elders and go get the OP. \n\nThe kid needs to be rewarded and shown positive reinforcement!", ">your parents need to figure out that they were done parenting you 30 years ago\n\nThe irony that the issue parents are complaining about, is OP bringing up how they used to give his gifts away when he was a kid, when its 40 years later and they still feel like they have the right to give his gifts to other people.", "Parents have to be in their 70s at least, and still boundary stomping.\n\nIt's unclear whether OP only recently started enforcing boundaries or whether he's been fighting the good fight his whole life, but either way, it's never too late to develop a backbone...", "Even if they were cheap, they didn\u2019t belong to Mom so she had no right to take them for any reason.", "They're also not actually that fun for little kids. They're also not *made* for little kids. Preteens, maybe, but 5-year-olds? What 5-year-old wants to follow all those painstaking instructions? \n\nI haven't built that many LEGO sets, but I've done one of the architecture/city skyline ones, and I would NOT have enjoyed that shit at all as a child. Those pieces wouldn't even have been fun to make random other stuff out of, because they're so small and precise. They're not building blocks, they're more like pieces of an intricate 3D puzzle. \n\nPlus, those sets are a MAJOR choking hazard for little kids. So many tiny and thin pieces. \n\nI'm with you. If Mom wants to buy the kids a $200+ toy that might kill them and that they won't even enjoy playing with, that's her prerogative. But she's got some serious introspecting to do when her 5-year-old great-grandkid understands and respects other people's belongings and boundaries more than she, a 65-70+ adult, does.", "That's a good Idea.\n\nMom: Honey, Where's the InstantPot?\n\nDad: Isn't it on the shelf.\n\nSon:  I gave it to the neighbor kids.

During one Passover seder, one of the kids showed my husband a toy box and asked Michael to open it for him. The package was yellowed and the toy inside was brand-spanking-new. \n\nMichael thought better of it and showed it to Larry. Larry paused, shook his head and gave the kid different toy to play with. Nothing was opened and everyone was happy.", "You\u2019d be surprised-or maybe not-at how entitled some family members can be in someone else\u2019s house/with someone else\u2019s stuff.", "Yes! It\u2019s exactly what I also take from that! OP still isn\u2019t entitled to his own presents in his parents minds!!! Astonishing!", "If I ever reach an age where it's inappropriate for me to play with toys, shoot me", "So...she broke your toy so she could give it to another kid? She wasn\u2019t even smart enough to say that it got destroyed somehow instead of breaking it? And she thought someone else would be happy getting a used and broken toy?\nWow.", "Do you not?  \n\nI'm 43, my mother is in her 70s, my partner is 45, his mother is in her 80s, and we all give each other gifts for our birthdays.", "I would hate to have taken the time and expense to buy a nice birthday present, only to have some idiot turn it over to some kids to play with it. Thank goodness for the 5-year-old grandson who knew OP's rules.", "I wouldn't even limit it to being terrible parents, they sound like all round terrible people.", "Yes, but for some reason some reason just won\u2019t learn. I mean it\u2019s possible that they can\u2019t because they lack the ability to really look at themselves and be critical. I highly doubt it, though. In this case I think they were just always used to getting their own way and never realized that their kids are actual adults now.", "Amen. My parents never messed with my stuff but my mom would sometimes move and clean even though I asked her not to. She finally stopped when I blew up after she accidentally vacuumed up some small parts I had left off to the side.\nWhy did I leave them there?\nBecause I didn\u2019t expect someone to vacuum there and thought it was safe.", "My husband will be turning 50 soon and he has a room full of Star Wars collectibles ( a few of the Lego sets)\u2026 the things that he has I would never buy for a little kid! Way too expensive! Nta! Collect whatever makes you happy", "NTA\n\nThey had it coming to them.", "Right? How is OP supposed to stop bringing up behavior from \"decades ago\" if it's behavior that they *still* engage in *now*?", "My wife is addicted. I\u2019m almost embarrassed to say how many sets we have. It\u2019s\u2026. A lot. Storage racks full, a lot. She\u2019s currently building the grand piano, and while I think the sets are a nightmare, she loves them! \n\n100% not kid friendly, best you can hope for is they don\u2019t break or lose parts.", "Same here.", "I got my husband a Ninja Turtles Party Wagon for Christmas last year. Brought back a ton of memories from his childhood, and he was so excited about getting an actual toy for Christmas for the first time since he was a kid.", "I believe the boxes say they're for ages up to 99.", "I\u2019m 64 and collect Legos.", "Yep, turned 50 a few weeks ago and the Fam sent cash, because they were too obtuse to talk to my wife about what I would actually like.  Spent most of it on Lego!\n\nBest purchase this year for sure!", "We can certainly praise the grandson - he should be applauded because he has more concern and respect for rules that OP's parents!", "Yes!  OP, buy that kid some age-appropriate Legos!", "Miserable even.", "Seriously. Turning 45 this year. Just completed the LEGO Grand Piano model, the Starry Night, and the Bonsai Tree. Up next...maybe the Viking Ship w/sea serpent? Or the Succulent plants.\n\nOh, and...got a Christmas tree for the first time in a decade or more. You guessed it...Lego. Next year I might kick in for the corresponding lighting set.\n\nThat's the thing about first-gen Lego kids: we didn't grow out of them, they grew up along with us. Now, they're for all ages (depending on the model, o/c).", "That sounds awesome!
