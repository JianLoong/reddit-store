Let them know that you're fine with keeping it in the past, but if they ever try this again - even one peep - you will bring it up in front of everyone.

I hope you enjoyed all your presents!", "NTA\n\nYou stated a boundary, they felt they had the right to ignore it, you reminded them they do not.

I seriously doubt the kids even cared since they had stuff to play with.
