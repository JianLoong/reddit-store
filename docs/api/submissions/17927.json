A. That is a choking hazard and B. ZERO FUN FOR A KID. NTA, your parents need to figure out that they were done parenting you 30 years ago. Hell, it doesn't sound like they did a great job when you were an actual child.", "Mom messed about and found out.\n\nLego sets aren\u2019t cheap, are highly collectible, and all that aside\u2026 it is yours. If you don\u2019t want someone else messing with it, that\u2019s your call to make.\n\nMom can run on down to Walmart and buy all the sets she wants for the kids to romp on.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour parents made an issue of it, your mom escalated it by stealing your present, and you explained perfectly why you keep your toys to yourself, as if it was any of their weird busybody business anyway, which it isn't. If they didn't want their shitty past parenting conduct brought up, they should have left it deep in the past. \n\nIf she brings it up again in public, just say loudly \"You took away my toys when I was a kid to give them to other kids but I'm damned if your going to do it when I'm an adult!\" each and every time. Let them know that your fine with keeping it in the past, but if they ever try this again - even one peep - you will bring it up in front of everyone. Then do it.", "NTA, your parents need to learn to respect your stuff. As simple as that.", "NTA. Jesus Christ the audacity of your parents. They don\u2019t know boundaries. It\u2019s not even the toys/collectibles at this point, its about the principle of not respecting YOUR things. \n\nMaybe give away their valuable things lend it and/or give it away and see how they feel.", "NTA and this is probably what they needed to hear. The fact it was public is going to make the lesson stick harder or at the very least make your point that much more pronounced.\n\nThey obviously have no respect for you or the things you cherish and that was started at a young age. They deserve to know that what they did was wrong and how it effected you. They also chose to try and violate that respect in a public way in your own home, so when the clapback happens publicly, they honestly shouldn't be surprised (stupid games, stupid prizes).\n\nStand your ground OP, they're 100% in the wrong and they know it. Otherwise they wouldn't be so scandalized for being called out.\n\nAlso good catch on saving that set, those Star Wars sets can be crazy-priced! Your grandson is a good kid for having the good sense your parents don't.", "NTA. Your parents have never learned to have respect for other people's belongings. A lesson your grandson has already learned at 5yo.", "NTA. Your parents keep on judging what YOU like and they look like they are not keen on discussing about your boundaries and are just mad that you called them out. Public calling or not, that\u2019s the consequence of their actions and they should deal with them as adults do (if they mention immaturity so much).", "NTA\n\nYour mom went into YOUR office, in YOUR house and took YOUR birthday gift that you specifically told her why they could not play with it and she expects you to be all cool?", "  NTA. Good for you! To answer your sister, you wouldn\u2019t have had to call your parents out \u2018in public,\u2019 if your mom hadn\u2019t shown her ass in public.", "NTA, \n\nNot their toys and no one cares about their opinion", "NTA-The fact that a five year old has more insight into how wrong this is, is scary. Next time your mom gets a gift, take it from her and see how she reacts. Then remind her of this situation.", "NTA. Its weird to go to someone elses birthday party, and try to dictate what they do with their presents. Lots of adults collect legos, action figures, comic books etc.. its a hobby. They were shaming you at a public party for what you received and what you chose to do with them, and tried going behind your back doing what they wanted with them. You even offered a different option for the kids! There wasnt any reason the children couldnt have played with what you said was okay to play with and not your new sets. Its not your fault they got embarrassed by your reaction. I hope you enjoyed all your presents!", "NTA\n\nYou stated a boundary, they felt they had the right to ignore it, you reminded them they do not. They have a history of disrespecting boundaries like the one you stated, so you gave them examples of their blatant disregard of boundaries; their relevance to the matter at hand doesn\u2019t wain simply because it occurred in the far past as they have shown that they still don\u2019t think they need to respect your boundaries.", "NTA If you don't want other people hearing about the things you do, then you shouldn't do those things. This isn't a you problem, it's a them problem. And you can do whether the hell you want with your own gifts. I also have some collectibles that kids can't play with. I seriously doubt the kids even cared since they had stuff to play with. They're free to share their own gifts with the kids.", "NTA\n\nYour parents didn't respect your things when you were little and they don't respect your things now. I wonder if she would like you re-gifting her new clothes or old jewelry.", " NTA your parents are terrible parents. You\u2019re 50 and they\u2019re STILL stealing from you. I\u2019m so sorry!", "NTA \nGood for you,  this confrontation was well overdue", "NTA Why don't they bring toys for the kids if they are some concerned? Or the or the kid's parents should bring toys. From your post it's possible only your parents have this issue though. You also offered toys they could play with. What was wrong with those?", "NTA I can't believe your parents are still giving away your toys! the only difference is you're 50 not 6, so you get to be in control. Good job locking them out of your space. An X-Wing is NOT FOR KIDS.", "NTA. Similar age and collect Lego as well. AND my mother doesn't get it when I don't build some of them.", "NTA your parents suck.", "NTA\n\nIt's your property and you don't have to justify not sharing it with anyone.\n\nYour parents are ignorant for looking at your interests as \"just toys\" and not understanding the concept of being a collector.", "NTA - your mom sounds pretty awful. Is she capable of being nice? Or is this the norm?", "NTA. Toys are meant for children? Well shit nursing homes are meant for seniors too senile to remember the past. They're just mad that you destroyed the illusions they have built up over the years that they  weren't mediocre parents at best.", "NTA-they need to respect boundaries and your decisions.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nthe fact the 5yo knew doesn't reflect well on the parents here.", "NTA -  WOW your mom has no boundaries.\n\n>my mom went into my office and grabbed my new X-Wing set for the grandkids \n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My parents just kept at it telling me that toys were meant for children and that I was being immature \n\nOP you are NTA but your parents are pretty big AHs.", "NTA and I hate this idea about \u201ctoys\u201d and adults.

They are yours and you\u2019re not obligated to share them with anyone.", "NTA", "NTA and it doesn\u2019t even matter that the gifts were toys; they are yours and you get to decide who has access to the", "NTA", "NTA my egg donor would do the exact same thing, if i got a present at all. I will never forget 1995 i got a tiny tears for Christmas, that i had begged for all year but she mysteriously broke overnight so egg donor said she would exchange it, i am still waiting all these years later. \n\n\nIt sounds small in comparison with the other abuse i suffered but it still sticks with me that i wasn't even good enough for a simple toy.", "I was going to say totally not TA, because taking one of your collectibles to give away is acctual theft/vandalism - but - bringing up what your parents did 40+ years ago is something you save for family therapy, not a Christmas party.
