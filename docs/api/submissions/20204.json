I\u2019m(29F) a cloud architect at a tech company and currently making ~180k a year. And yet he has still made remakes that I might be a gold digger. I own the house we live in together. I own most of the furniture and my car and I helped him buy his car at a discounted price because I have a close relationship to a dealership because my family has bought cars from them for decades. \n\nRecently he bought up signing a prenup saying when he graduates from residency he wants to keep our finances separate and protect himself. I got so mad because I\u2019m charging him far less rent than he would be paying normally (800 for his share when a place in my neighborhood is 3000 so he would normally be paying 1500 or more) and he would be paying 5000 more for his car if not for me. I told him ok sure I will sign but in return from now on you are paying the going rate for rent and you will do at least 50 percent of the housework. I do at least 70-80 percent of the housework plus I do most of the cooking even though he argues mowing the lawn or shoving snow once a week makes it equivalent. I do more because he works long hours and is on call every other week but now it\u2019s clear he doesn\u2019t appreciate it I have no reason to do it. \n\nI also told him he needs to back pay the different in rent and be paying me for all the extra hours of housework and cooking Ive been doing. He got angry and told me that\u2019s \u201cin the past\u201d and I can\u2019t ask for backpay. I said I could because this relationship is clearly him gold digging because I make 3X his salary and I\u2019m giving him discounted rent so if I was a man and he was a women he doubt he would say he himself was the gold digger.

Make him sign the prenup now and separate your finances.  He will leave you.  You will be sad for a minute and then find someone who sees your value for more than a paycheck.", "NTA\n\nCut your losses. This guy is an absolute fool.", "NTA. He is accusing you of being a gold digger when he is literally living off of your money. I\u2019m sorry, but I feel like this relationship won\u2019t work out  due to his behavior. He is 100% acting like you two aren\u2019t equal a treats you like shit. After he graduates he will act even worse. He will try to guilt trip you so he doesn\u2019t have to pay much etc\u2026 and he will want you do all the housework home. And if you decline he will say you are a gold digger.", "NTA. You held up a mirror and he didn't like the truth he saw.", "NTA\n\nI have weirdly seen a lot of guys with no money talking like this. I think there are particular misogynistic internet circles that feed this kind of rhetoric. This kind of thinking can very quickly lead to the dehumanisation of women and is reflective of a larger issue. \n\nI also don\u2019t understand his obsession with gold diggers being after him if he is an committed relationship. Especially when he is in a committed relationship with someone who is making more money than him and is paying his way through medical school. \n\nYour response was perfect. You aren\u2019t the asshole for telling him the truth. He needed to hear it.\n\nI would personally be seriously questioning the relationship if I were you. The whole thing is entirely unhinged. He has some serious ego problems and a really skewed view of women", "Your comment was precisely on the nose. He's hypocritical, insulting and weirdly punishing. If I'm you I'm looking for a boyfriend who isn't caught up in an insulting victim complex. NTA", "NTA and be wary.  He\u2019s going to come back and be apologetic, and say that you\u2019re right that your relationship doesn\u2019t need a prenup.  And then y\u2019all will set the wedding for a few years from now and he\u2019s going to spring a prenup on you a week before your wedding.\n\nHe\u2019s going to let you support him throughout medical school and then dump you when you won\u2019t sign the prenup.", "NTA. He sounds like a selfish person. He is only interested in what you can do for him. Why do you want to be with him?", "NTA. He is clearly projecting.", "NTA\n\nI can't even believe that you're even talking about marriage with someone like him. \n\nI don't even know you guys, but with the info provided, this relationship is toxic and will DEFINITELY get worse if (with his attitude) he graduates and you guys are still together. \n\nIf he's like this now, making 60k to your 120k, then he would definitely start showing his ass if he makes it to 300-500k.", "NTA, everything you said was spot on", "NTA and honestly, still good idea to go for prenup that separates the assets and debts you acquired prior marriage (you will have more prior than him for sure, but the high doctor salary is conditional to a lot of things and he probably will still have to clear his debt) and have some % of the income after marriage go into shared account. Otherwise you owning your accommodation means he is living rent free, as you rightfully pointed out.", "NTA\n\nWhile prenup is always a good idea, it's weird he wants it only when he is the one earning more. As in it's okay for him to use you for your money and household labour but is scared money might be the reason you were with him?", "NTA. While not romantic, prenups are practical when there's lots of assets involved. That being said, his constant comments about you possibly being a gold digger are completely unhinged and would be enough for me personally to walk away. But no you're in the right", "NTA. Pay everything equal.

Why are you with him?", "NTA your response to him was so satisfying. He stormed out because you were completely right. Hilarious how it's always the broke men complaining about women gold digging them", "NTA and girl please drop him, he is not worth a single second of yours. Also, please tell him on my behalf too - he is a good digger and an a$$hole.", "NTA.  So much abuse in one post.  It sounds like he is projecting on you.  Forget the prenup;  seems it might be in your better long-term interests to keep your finances very separate.", "NTA. What\u2019s sauce for the goose\u2026\u2026", "NTA. It is quite unfair for him to pay so less and still expecting you to go out of your way by getting him discounts.", "NTA You wouldn't be the first woman to help her man through med school only to be dumped at the end. I would think strongly about my future.", "NTA - why stay? He clearly has doubts about you, and wanting to support you and has taken your support for granted. Red flag and it shows he doesn\u2019t trust you. Also the fact that he\u2019s talking about gold diggers wanting him when he\u2019s in a relationship with you is a huge sign that he\u2019s looking elsewhere. I\u2019d drop him now bc he\u2019s shown his true colors and he doesn\u2019t deserve you. If you go along with his lame ass behavior and end up breaking up later, it will support his twisted gold digger narrative.", "NTA, I bet the farm that within a year of graduation he will find someone new.  He is using you   big time.  Who knows where your income will be in four years.  It could be as high or higher than his.  There is no guarantee he will graduate.  Your best bet is to serve him with eviction papers.  If your name is not on the title of the car stop paying for it. He needs a wakeup call.", "NTA. He technically is a gold digger, and him calling you a possible one is messed up. Drop him and kick him out if you can because it's obvious that he's a self-centered prick.", "I've seen anecdotes from doctors that it's common for new male docs to break up with the partner who supported them through their studies.\n\nThe money lets their values change.\n\nDon't be taken for a fool.", "NTA  You wouldn't be the first woman to help her man through med school only to be dumped at the end.

If you want to have children, please do not have them with this man. You will not have a happy experience of motherhood with him. \n\nI love being a mum so, so much.

Were you wrong? Nooo. Do you think this dynamic is gonna change?", "nta - but in theory you should put a pre nup in place becuase from what your saying is u basically own you own the home and make tons more than he does and u own the furniture. i personally would have him sign one so u dont lose the house and contents if he wants to behave that way.", "NTA but why would you be with someone calling you a gold digger?\n\nLike, you're clearly a successful person and I'm sure you have plenty to offer in a relationship. Why be with someone who's comfortable insulting you like that, let alone be discussing marriage with them? Not to mention the complete lack of common sense he displays, along with the fact he's happy to dish it out and then throw a tantrum when he's told he's wrong.\n\nI spent years of my life just letting someone say horrible things about me and what kind of person I am. I can't imagine being with someone who'd believe something so bad about me and treat me with suspicion like that.", "NTA. He's showing you who he is. Believe him. His plan is to mooch off you until he graduates, then either dump you or restrict your ability to benefit from his higher income. He's just too stupid to keep it to himself (or maybe he's so proud of his plan that he can't keep himself from telling you about it). The fact that he doesn't contribute his fair share of the household work, on top of not contributing financially, is another red flag. You can do better.", "NTA, but he\u2019s planning on leaving you once he reaches his full salary potential. Please plan accordingly. Good luck, you deserve an equal partner who appreciates you and I hope you find him. Please do not entertain this fool any longer, he has clearly told on himself.", " Girl get rid of him like trash. He is garbage. No more stupidity he is yesterday\u2019s hero", "Watch.  He's such an idiot, he will wind up with the biggest gold digger ever.

Who needs that in your life?", "Truth hurts and he just got whacked with a big one!\n\nWhy is he worried about gold diggers if he's in a committed relationship with you?\n\nDefinitely planning on dumping you when he's done mooching off you.", "idk but whatever else, you and him seem to have a rather toxic relationship with money", "Interesting that no one commented on her making 3 times his salary but expecting 50/50. The double standards keep on doubling! On all post I have seen when the woman is the lower earner it is all percentage earned which here would be 75/25 and financial abuse paying50/50 would impact on her saving etc! Thanks for being hypocrites almost every single time! OP also the uneven split in chores is that because of how ungodly hours and the sheer number or is he lounging around because if he is doing 15 hours a day you moaning about chores but you only do 9 hrs looks real petty imo but hey you should break it off and find someone who matches you now not who will out strip you in 4 years!", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
