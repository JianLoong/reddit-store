On the day they're supposed to pay rent, we wake up and the car is gone with no explanation. We drive all over trying to find them, but we find nothing. They're not answering calls or messages.

They say that since I've never been addicted to anything that I can't judge their situation. They say that they're good people who just fell on hard times, and that if I were in their shoes that I'd want someone like my gf to help me out. \n\nThey also are calling me the asshole because they say that no one deserves to live on the streets, no matter what their past is like, and that I overreacted instead of trying to meet them in the middle\n\nHelp keep the sub engaging!\n\n#Don\u2019t downvote assholes!\n\nDo upvote interesting posts!\n\n [Click Here For Our Rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules) and [Click Here For Our FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\n\n##Subreddit Announcement\n\n###[The Asshole Universe is Expanding, Again: Introducing Another New Sister Subreddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/128nbp3/the_asshole_universe_is_expanding_again/)\n\nFollow the link above to learn more\n\n ---\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Your GF didn't seem to understand that, she's enabling their behavior big time. Your GF's sister and her partner are toxic af and you don't need that in your life. If your GF didn't see that, that's on her tbh. You deserve to have stability in your life, sorry that happened OP and I hope things get better.", "NTA you did the right thing for you.

It\u2019s a difficult cycle, my heart goes out to everyone affected by their actions.", "NTA  as someone married into the family of an enabler, I say get out ,stay out, keep far far away, do not listen, do not take calls or messages, block everything,  do not have money or valuables anywhere - lock them up in storage-  or move.  Do not listen to any sob stories. Do not believe they've changed. \nMy bil is finally in jail, and slowly beginning to realise he has been a piece of s..t, but enabler is still doing all the wrong things.", "NTA. Your gf is not willing to stop enabling them. Don't get dragged down too.", "NTA - I'd stay as far away as possible from all of these people. Your life will improve greatly.", "NTA you did the right thing for you. It will take longer, maybe much longer for your ex to realise the same thing as you, but that\u2019s her path to walk and you do not need to have yourself involved in all the drama and money-leeching if you choose not to. \n\nYour ex chose her sister over you anyway. Now you are choosing you. Good move. You deserve better and you have been more than generous snd understanding already with these people.", "NTA your girlfriend will keep giving her sister money.

You are very intelligent to leave now, rather than later, because these people, including your gf, will make you homeless with their B.S.\nYou ex will probably try to convince you it was just once, she didn't mean for you to leave, etc., but that's her addiction to the Savior complex taking, not her .  Meth addicts don't care who they take down with them. You did more than you should. It's over. Your ex was never going to stop engaging them.\nBest wishes for your continued success! Take care.", "NTA, \n\nShe is enabling them.", "NTA.  Nobody should ever enable addicts.  Addicts will lie, steal, or cheat to support the habit.  Nobody should participate in a relationship with a person who is enabling an addict.", "Well there's not much to be said here, nta.

She\u2019ll probably be funding her sister for eternity.", "Also don\u2019t listen to the sob story of your girlfriend.( that she believed they would change, she\u2019s so sorry, you\u2019re not supportive etc).She might feel an obligation to her sister, but it is better to frame it that way ( she\u2019s family, I\u2019ll help her no matter what) rather than say sister has changed. And if girlfriend wants to help, she could do so without your involvement at all. From her own money ( as long as you don\u2019t need to subsidise her contribution to the relationship because she spent all her money on her sister, )not get them to live with you and use your home and vehicles ( I\u2019m so glad you weren\u2019t more involved with the police to prove your innocence). And sometimes the best help is cutting them off, people sometimes will rise on their own if are no extended arms to pick them up."]}
