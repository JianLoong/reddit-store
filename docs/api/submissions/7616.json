You mentioned she was married.", "Why is your daughter so upset?

I'm going with ESH, because I do get a sense that you paid more attention to Penny because she only has you as a \"father figure.\" 26 is a little old to be holding grudges against a step-sibling, unless they were deliberately making your life hell.", "NAH, damned if you do and damned if you don't.\n\nHad you gone to your daughter's wedding, your wife would feel (justifiably) abandoned by her husband and I'd say your marriage could be at very real risk, especially if she didn't survive. You'd be leaving your wife at probably the most vulnerable moment in her entire life.\n\nHad you chosen not to go, your daughter would also feel (justifiably) abandoned by her dad on what's meant to be the happiest day of her life.\n\nMy heart goes out to you OP, there was no way you were coming out of this looking good.", "NAH, at least at first.\n\nI'm so sorry, you had no good option there.  Even if you'd gone to the wedding, you'd have been an emotional and psychological mess thinking about Penny in the hospital.  You went to the hospital, and you missed Jess' wedding.  \n\nYou made the right decision.  I imagine there's a lot more family history here, but you know that better than any of us.  Between one daughter's wedding, and another potentially dying in the hospital?  I'd have to pick the one potentially dying in the hospital.\n\nToo bad your daughters have such a toxic relationship.  If my sibling or I got into an accident on the other's wedding day, the weddings cancelled, or at most, really rushed to exchanging vows.", "NAH because there were no good options, but choosing to sit at a hospital and waiting to see if you would be allowed to see your stepdaughter instead of walking your daughter down the aisle deeply wounded Jess. If she does ever speak to you again, please start by apologizing profusely.\n\nShe may have already decided that you are dead to her as a way to protect herself from being heartbroken over your choices in the future.", "I could not imagine my own father not walking me down the isle. You could have taken separate cars and went to the hospital later. You chose your step-daughter over your real daughter. My heart hurts for her. She will never forget this and I don\u2019t believe she will ever forgive you. I hope your step-daughter is worth it to you because that is the only daughter you have now.", "NAH.

Just time handle it.", "NAH, but I can understand why Jess was devastated. \n\nYou've been Penny's dad since she was what, 6? She's your daughter too, and you thought she was going to die. That trumps wedding, unfortunately. It was a true life or death situation, as you have described it and you needed to be there for her. It's so shit, and the timing is just heartbreaking, but like all parenting - Penny's accident and subsequent condition was the glass ball that day, and the wedding was unfortunately plastic. \n\nThat said, Jess' feelings are entirely valid - she missed out on something that was incredibly important to her in having you walk her down the aisle and miss her wedding. Getting this news a few hours before your wedding would be so heartbreaking, and even worse if there is existing rivalry/hurt there. \n\nIt sounds like it's really compounded some existing issues of favouritism for her, and that's the crux of what you really need to deal with and work on with your daughter. When she is ready to speak to you, you need to tread incredibly carefully and start by just listening. \n\nIs it possible also that your daughter is feeling awkward about her reaction on the day, especially given the your other daughter is still in a coma?", "Most likely the AH, How long have you been putting you wife and stepdaughter ahead of your daughter?  How many firsts have you done with your stepdaughter and not your daughter?  This wasn\u2019t just about missing the wedding it\u2019s about you missing all the important things in your daughters life but not your stepdaughters.", "YTA. Sounds like there must be a lot of history of choosing your SD over your daughter based on her reaction. You could have gone to the wedding while your wife went to the hospital and joined her after.  I'm sure your daughter would have understood you leaving straight after the father/daughter dance instead of abandoning her altogether.  I think your relationship with your daughter may have now come to an end.", "YTA. Never put anyone above YOUR child. Here\u2019s the thing\u2026reality is you Couldn\u2019t see Penny anyway. You were just outside of the hospital waiting. What good does that do? You should have been there for your daughter. My guess is you\u2019ve always put other people before her and this is why her reaction was so big.", "Mmm I don't think this is really about the wedding itself, your daughter is probably angry that you have put more attention/effort into SD, (not in this specific situation which was a life threatening one) but in general, unfortunately for your daughter your SD is a stranger and from her point of view you preferred that over her, not saying is the correct thing but that's all the problem here, I say NTA in being next to your SD in a critic moment, but you have a lot to catch up to do with your daughter, if she is ever willing to talk with you.", "[deleted]", "NTA. I could understand Jess being disappointed and angry at the situation, but you thought your other daughter was going to die, and you needed to be there to support her and your wife. Jess is being unreasonable.", "NTA - I know Jess must be upset as it's her big day (and probably once in a lifetime) especially she doesn't really like Penny so I can understand Jess' feeling even though that is inappropriate. However you're the father figure for both of them, and I'd do the same if I were you. Especially if one of my kid is involved in a serious accident. Give Jess some time, and talk to her nicely. Best of luck, and speedy recovery for Penny.", "NTA.  \n\nAt the end of the day, the only people that NEED to be at a wedding are the Bride and Groom. I am heartbroken for anyone who thinks their wedding day is their \"most important moment of her life\", thus I have little sympathy for many of these AITAs.  It's NOT \"the most important day\" because there are there are 100x many more, esp when you have children. \n\nHowever.  I think this relationship is more strenuous that written here.....", "NTA - you were put in a horrible situation, and im glad to hear Penny is doing better. Jess has every right to be upset as it was her wedding day, but I would hope she would have at least a little sympathy for Penny. She should not have yelled at you like that and hold this against you.", "Oofff NAH this one unfortunately may not be fixable. If it is fixable it is completely up to you to repair the damage with your daughter. While I fully understand you being at the hospital you still missed one of the most important moments of your daughters life. By her reaction it seems she feels like she\u2019s been slighted before. Apologize, repeatedly, write her a letter apologizing, discuss how you can mend the relationship. You can\u2019t make up for missing her wedding, that\u2019s not possible but you can try to do something special for her.", "This was a no-win situation for OP. \n\nHe had to choose between missing his daughter\u2019s wedding or leaving his wife alone in a hospital waiting room while her daughter (his stepdaughter) was potentially dying. \n\nThis sub would\u2019ve crucified OP either way. \n\nNAH", "NTA.\n\nYou were put in a difficult situation and chose (in my opinion) correctly.\n\nYour daughter isn't an AH for being upset about her wedding day being overshadowed. That's understandable.\n\nBUT she is the AH for being a complete cock about it. She's STILL refusing to talk to you? Is she five years old? Has she even once asked if her step-sister is ok? She's showing her true colours and it ain't a pretty picture, OP.", "YTA- you could have walked jess down the aisle then gone back to the hospital. It really sounds like you have a history of favoring penny over jess. You mention you're the only father penny has ever had but what about jess? Does she have another father? Have you ever been there for her?", "NTA\n\nLife hanging in the balance absolutely takes precedence over a wedding.", "NTA. You were exactly where you needed to be. If your bio daughter was in the same situation you were have been at the hospital for her.", "NTA - and Jess is an AH. Yes a wedding is an important day, it celebrates a beginning and is for family and friends. \n\nBut it does not decide everything in life. It is a luxury and a gift to have a beautiful wedding, but it is not essential for a love/ marriage and a family - many bridzillas forget that.\n\nThis was about the death and life of your daughter. Of course you go to the hospital! Of course you stay there and by her side and support your wife. It could well have been a goodbye.\n\nI wish your one daughter a good recovery and your other daughter more humility and compassion.", "YTA\n\nYour lack of answering questions, plus your daughter's comments, led me to the conclusion this had happened before.\n\nMaybe you feel like a hero to your stepdaughter, so you always put her first. Who knows.\n\nYou couldn't help this situation, but you obviously have a deep problem with being a father to your daughter. You've probably lost her. You don't seem capable of doing what she would need to allow you back into her life.", "YTA, why couldn\u2019t you walk her then leave after the ceremony? I really hope your step daughter pulls through, because she\u2019s your only daughter now", "NTA. I was nearly killed in a car accident, my sister was at the hospital that night and every day for the month after while I was in a coma. Fair enough the two don't get along, but to want to leave somebody laying dying in the hospital all alone? That's nor okay, she doesn't have to go to the hospital if she doesn't want to, but she has no right to tell other people they're wrong for going.", "NTA", "NTA. A wedding is an important party, but a party nonetheless. Someone hospitalized may literally die because someone wasn\u2019t there to make sure they get the care they need.", "With the context you've provided, NTA. It was a sucky situation, however I cannot fault you for running to your daughter's side once you found out. All the other commenters saying that you should've stayed and let your wife go don't seem to understand that when a loved one is that touch and go, that critical, any moment could be a goodbye. I would've made the same decision and I would've wanted my parents to make the same desicion, god forbid that ever happen. \n\nYour daughter is valid in how she feels, however her wedding is insignificant compared to this medical emergency. I sympathise, however this is not a competition. She cares that you walked your other daughter down the aisle first and that she won't get the chance. She's allowed to feel sad, but being jealous over something like this when her step sister is fighting for her life? not a good look. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope your daughter recovers and your other daughter comes around to you. Maybe ask if you can make it up by doing a dinner for the newly weds where you do a father daughter dance.", "YTA. You completely ignored and abandoned your daughter on her wedding day.

Penny was hurt and in hospital but when you left you didn't know her condition. Your wife could of gone and you could of joined her later but you didn't even consider your daughter at all.\n\nThere was a way for you to walk your daughter down the isle and still be there for Penny and support your wife.\n\nBut you decided that Jesse wasn't important enough to even consider that. \n\nI can understand the tough predicament you were in and the worry that you must of felt, but you had to of known how much you not being there for her would of hurt Jesse and you still did it anyway.\n\nThen sat in a hospital doing absolutely nothing.

You need to ask what that was about.", "YTA. You had plenty of time to walk your daughter down the aisle.", "NAH. The only thing I would have done differently is leave my wife at the hospital and head to the wedding, be part of the ceremony and then head back to hospital after explaining the situation to my daughter.", "NAH.\n\nThis is such a complicated situation and I can't imagine being put in this position. You had to choose between walking your one daughter down the aisle and potentially saying goodbye to your other daughter. Both are momentous occasions in someone's life. While it is sad that you missed out on walking your daughter down the aisle, you would have been there physically but you wouldn't have been *present*. Your other daughter was fighting for her life and you didn't know if you would ever see her alive again. Not getting to say goodbye can be earth-shattering and something that you might not come back from emotionally.\n\nThat being said, your older daughter was entitled to her reaction, especially if there have been other occasions in her life where you put your younger daughter first. Also, her anger may be masking tremendous disappointment. Anger is a lot easier to connect to on a primal level than disappointment. I like what someone else said about potentially having a dinner for the newlyweds where y'all have a father daughter dance and see about making up any missed wedding photos, on your dime. Your relationship may never recover from this, but you did what you felt was right at the time. I hope though that in time your older daughter can see that you were in an untenable position.", "NTA. It could have been you in that car accident, would Jess still pitch a fit then? A wedding is one moment in a lifetime, it really has little standing in the overall picture of life.

Trust me, I know how important it is to have your father walk you down the aisle. But this was out of your control. Jess can be upset, she can be angry, but it wasn't your fault. Hopefully she will realise her overreaction at you.", "I think it's kind of telling that he hasn't responded to any questions pertaining to this.

It\u2019s one of the unspoken effects of even the most amicable divorces - the children of the divorce lose time with both parents when they are no longer together/custody means x time is spent with one parent, y time with the other. Any steps or half siblings that are full time in one home get both their parents full time, which causes a divide and a difference in the relationships between the children and their parents. \n\nThe only way to counter this has to be to proactively make it clear to the \u2018part time child\u2019 from the start, that you will make up for this comparative lack of time, by being there for the important events, giving them one on one time with you and not the steps/halfs- because they got that one on one time when the part time kid was away. Slotting the part time kid in with the full time household is not enough, and if anything contributes to conflict between kids. \n\nI\u2019m projecting like crazy here but I do hope you read. It is too late to mend old hurts if such slights have been felt by Jess since childhood. But if anything I\u2019ve written hits close, please take into account that this is likely not about the wedding for Jess, but about a pattern of treatment since childhood, relative to her stepsister (who she does not view as her family and possibly even sees as the one who \u2018stole\u2019 her dad all her life. Because you weren\u2019t able to make sure both were comfortable and safe to be secure enough to build a relationship without resentment). And if so, it is on your mistakes that this sad state has eventuated.", "You\u2019re not the asshole. I also understand Jess\u2019 initial reaction given the history. Maybe to her it just sounded convenient, in terms of timing. I hope she comes around to at least have a conversation with you!", "NTA- a big accident like that? You\u2019re at the hospital. Even if you hate the person to the depths of your soul, you at the very least ask if they\u2019re ok, ask what you can do to support the person and their family. Whilst I can get there\u2019s a LOT of resentment between Jess and Penny (don\u2019t know what\u2019s happened there, and if Penny fully recovers you really need to look into family therapy), doesn\u2019t excuse Jess not recognising that someone important in her Dad\u2019s life nearly died.", "I have doubts about this.

But you also love your daughter, and you realize your presence will have less effect on her marriage than it will the life you will continue to live with your wife and stepdaughter, if she does live through this.

But that doesn't make you an AH I think it makes you human.\n\nYour wording of several things and lack of info combined with your daughter's reaction makes me wonder how normal disappointing her or choosing your stepdaughter over her is, though. Specifically the wording of having given up meshing of the family. Or how you mentioned in her yelling at you she did bring up that you choose the stepdaughter over her in other situations. The thing is, even in the hypothetical situation that it's not totally accurate, her perceptions are valid and if she's not feeling your love and acceptance on an equal level then you're not doing something right if your actions have not successfully come across as care. The fact that you let her feelings of being undervalued even get to this breaking point over time is what I think makes you the potential AH. \n\nThe point is, *she* may think you're the AH, and that matters more than what what a group of internet strangers will have to say about it.\n\nEDIT: Just wanted to also add I'm very sorry to hear about the state of your stepdaughter, I'm sure that's a scary thing, but I'm happy for you that she's on the road to recovery now!", "I'm so sorry, this is just a horrible situation where literally there is no winning for you.

His wife needs his support because who the fuck is she gonna lean on if they tell her (his WIFE), her baby stopped breathing.

Also people can pick up on other people\u2019s emotions or \u201cvibes.\u201d People would pick up on his anxiousness, if he\u2019s uncomfortable, how he\u2019s behaving  and that will definitely clash terribly so with the feelings of happiness and whatever else people feel when they watch people get married. \n\nAnd even if he left right after walking her down the aisle or sneaking out after the ceremony it\u2019s still the possibly. Who wants to DRIVE in such an altered state of mind? That\u2019s an hour away from the hospital NTA. Op did what he thought was right and you can\u2019t shoot him for it cause to most people accidents will forever trump a day where They know their loved ones are safe and sound. \nAnother point to add. Imagine getting ready for a wedding and getting that call. Imagine hearing your daughter has been in an accident and the doctor/first responders aren\u2019t given you any details. You\u2019re mind would go blank, any previous engagements honestly would sound trivial in the moment the person on the phone gave vague details on their child\u2019s health and quality of life.

But frankly, when the police wouldn't tell them much beyond that they had to get to the hospital ASAP, that was a pretty damned good indication that it wasn't a minor fender bender.", "If they don\u2019t give info over the phone it\u2019s generally bad", "So, based on the fact that police won't tell you how bad it is, you'd decide a party has precedence, and you'd go find out what the situation with your kid was later? Ok then.", "a) the police not giving that info and being the ones to call said it was serious.\n\nb) it was five hours before the wedding, even with the travel time to the hospital and to the wedding he would have had three hours before the ceremony left.

Your biological child comes before your STEP-DAUGHTER always. He has continuously chosen Penny over Jess, which I know since Jess never liked her, why do you think that is????? Fact is he chose another woman and HER child over his own children. So many men do this I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s just easier or they just don\u2019t give a fuck about their own children. \nIt seems you are one of these step-moms who expected her husband to chose her children over his own.

I would like to hear her side.", "It's a horrible situation, no one is denying that. And if he has always treated the girl's equally, he did the right thing but, jess's reaction and the way he worded  things make me suspicious he's always put penny first.

It still might have left her upset but it would at least prove to her he loves her equally.", "Why do you get to decide what matters and doesn\u2019t matter in this situation? This story has holes in it that makes me wonder why the daughter doesn\u2019t get along with the step daughter.

The celebration of marriage. It pales in comparison.\n\nNot to mention the absolute, utter, patriarchal bullshit of having one man give a woman to another man, even only as a ritual. I have a daughter, and I would never do that.\n\nIronically, the rituals do have meaning for me, and so there are things I won't do. I wouldn't cut the umbilical cords when my kids were born either. \n\nSo, yes, I get that it's important, but it's not nearly as important as teetering on the brink of death.", "Clearly, this family has dysfunctions.

If he has always favored Penny, then that's a completely separate thing and he's the AH for that specific thing. But in no way should he leave a daughter on her deathbed to \"make it up\" to a daughter by attending her wedding while the bride's sister could be passing right at that very moment, alone.
