You mentioned she was married.", "Why is your daughter so upset? On the surface it seems like a very reasonable reason to miss an event.\n\nDoes your daughter feel you habitually choose your wife\u2019s child over her?", "You were really in a tough spot. I wouldn\u2019t say you\u2019re TA, but it doesn\u2019t matter what a bunch of internet strangers think.  You made the decision you did and it\u2019s obviously has affected your relationship with your eldest. Making the right choice doesn\u2019t mean you get off the hook for that choice hurting others.

You walked your SD down the aisle, but decided sitting in a hospital where you couldn\u2019t do anything was better than showing up for your own kid.

I'm going with ESH, because I do get a sense that you paid more attention to Penny because she only has you as a \"father figure.\" 26 is a little old to be holding grudges against a step-sibling, unless they were deliberately making your life hell.", "NAH, damned if you do and damned if you don't.\n\nHad you gone to your daughter's wedding, your wife would feel (justifiably) abandoned by her husband and I'd say your marriage could be at very real risk, especially if she didn't survive. You'd be leaving your wife at probably the most vulnerable moment in her entire life.\n\nHad you chosen not to go, your daughter would also feel (justifiably) abandoned by her dad on what's meant to be the happiest day of her life.\n\nMy heart goes out to you OP, there was no way you were coming out of this looking good.", "NAH, at least at first.\n\nI'm so sorry, you had no good option there.  Even if you'd gone to the wedding, you'd have been an emotional and psychological mess thinking about Penny in the hospital.  You went to the hospital, and you missed Jess' wedding.  \n\nYou made the right decision.  I imagine there's a lot more family history here, but you know that better than any of us.  Between one daughter's wedding, and another potentially dying in the hospital?  I'd have to pick the one potentially dying in the hospital.\n\nToo bad your daughters have such a toxic relationship.  If my sibling or I got into an accident on the other's wedding day, the weddings cancelled, or at most, really rushed to exchanging vows.", "NAH because there were no good options, but choosing to sit at a hospital and waiting to see if you would be allowed to see your stepdaughter instead of walking your daughter down the aisle deeply wounded Jess. If she does ever speak to you again, please start by apologizing profusely.\n\nShe may have already decided that you are dead to her as a way to protect herself from being heartbroken over your choices in the future.", "I could not imagine my own father not walking me down the isle. You could have taken separate cars and went to the hospital later. You chose your step-daughter over your real daughter. My heart hurts for her. She will never forget this and I don\u2019t believe she will ever forgive you. I hope your step-daughter is worth it to you because that is the only daughter you have now.", "NAH.  You certainly did the right thing.  But Jesse's wedding certainly was impacted.  She has a right to her anger but you HAD to go to the hospital.", "You could have at least walked her down the aisle. I\u2019m sure your daughter has a long list of times where she felt second. Yes, the accident was terrible but you didn\u2019t have to attend the reception. There\u2019s no coming back from this. \n\nYTA", "YTA", "This is beyond this Subs judgment. Just time handle it.", "NAH, but I can understand why Jess was devastated. \n\nYou've been Penny's dad since she was what, 6? She's your daughter too, and you thought she was going to die. That trumps wedding, unfortunately. It was a true life or death situation, as you have described it and you needed to be there for her. It's so shit, and the timing is just heartbreaking, but like all parenting - Penny's accident and subsequent condition was the glass ball that day, and the wedding was unfortunately plastic. \n\nThat said, Jess' feelings are entirely valid - she missed out on something that was incredibly important to her in having you walk her down the aisle and miss her wedding. Getting this news a few hours before your wedding would be so heartbreaking, and even worse if there is existing rivalry/hurt there. \n\nIt sounds like it's really compounded some existing issues of favouritism for her, and that's the crux of what you really need to deal with and work on with your daughter. When she is ready to speak to you, you need to tread incredibly carefully and start by just listening. \n\nIs it possible also that your daughter is feeling awkward about her reaction on the day, especially given the your other daughter is still in a coma?", "Most likely the AH, How long have you been putting you wife and stepdaughter ahead of your daughter?  How many firsts have you done with your stepdaughter and not your daughter?  This wasn\u2019t just about missing the wedding it\u2019s about you missing all the important things in your daughters life but not your stepdaughters.", "YTA. Sounds like there must be a lot of history of choosing your SD over your daughter based on her reaction. You could have gone to the wedding while your wife went to the hospital and joined her after.  I'm sure your daughter would have understood you leaving straight after the father/daughter dance instead of abandoning her altogether.  I think your relationship with your daughter may have now come to an end.", "YTA. Never put anyone above YOUR child. Here\u2019s the thing\u2026reality is you Couldn\u2019t see Penny anyway. You were just outside of the hospital waiting. What good does that do? You should have been there for your daughter. My guess is you\u2019ve always put other people before her and this is why her reaction was so big.", "Mmm I don't think this is really about the wedding itself, your daughter is probably angry that you have put more attention/effort into SD, (not in this specific situation which was a life threatening one) but in general, unfortunately for your daughter your SD is a stranger and from her point of view you preferred that over her, not saying is the correct thing but that's all the problem here, I say NTA in being next to your SD in a critic moment, but you have a lot to catch up to do with your daughter, if she is ever willing to talk with you.", "This is a really unfortunate situation and I\u2019m so sorry for what you\u2019re going through. You are obviously a loving dad to BOTH of your daughters. Biology is inconsequential here. They are both your daughters, period. It\u2019s sad that they don\u2019t get along, and sad that your older daughter doesn\u2019t seem to care how your younger daughter is doing, but what else could you have done? Walked her down the aisle KNOWING your other daughter was at death\u2019s door, pretending everything was fine. Left your partner of 15 years (the person you should prioritize most, in my personal opinion) alone at the hospital in such a situation? This was life or death, and you had zero control over the situation. NTA.", "NTA. I could understand Jess being disappointed and angry at the situation, but you thought your other daughter was going to die, and you needed to be there to support her and your wife. Jess is being unreasonable.", "NTA - I know Jess must be upset as it's her big day (and probably once in a lifetime) especially she doesn't really like Penny so I can understand Jess' feeling even though that is inappropriate. However you're the father figure for both of them, and I'd do the same if I were you. Especially if one of my kid is involved in a serious accident. Give Jess some time, and talk to her nicely. Best of luck, and speedy recovery for Penny.", "NTA.  \n\nAt the end of the day, the only people that NEED to be at a wedding are the Bride and Groom. I am heartbroken for anyone who thinks their wedding day is their \"most important moment of her life\", thus I have little sympathy for many of these AITAs.  It's NOT \"the most important day\" because there are there are 100x many more, esp when you have children. \n\nHowever.  I think this relationship is more strenuous that written here.....", "NTA - you were put in a horrible situation, and im glad to hear Penny is doing better. Jess has every right to be upset as it was her wedding day, but I would hope she would have at least a little sympathy for Penny. She should not have yelled at you like that and hold this against you.", "Oofff NAH this one unfortunately may not be fixable. If it is fixable it is completely up to you to repair the damage with your daughter. While I fully understand you being at the hospital you still missed one of the most important moments of your daughters life. By her reaction it seems she feels like she\u2019s been slighted before. Apologize, repeatedly, write her a letter apologizing, discuss how you can mend the relationship. You can\u2019t make up for missing her wedding, that\u2019s not possible but you can try to do something special for her.", "This was a no-win situation for OP. \n\nHe had to choose between missing his daughter\u2019s wedding or leaving his wife alone in a hospital waiting room while her daughter (his stepdaughter) was potentially dying. \n\nThis sub would\u2019ve crucified OP either way. \n\nNAH", "NTA.\n\nYou were put in a difficult situation and chose (in my opinion) correctly.\n\nYour daughter isn't an AH for being upset about her wedding day being overshadowed. That's understandable.\n\nBUT she is the AH for being a complete cock about it. She's STILL refusing to talk to you? Is she five years old? Has she even once asked if her step-sister is ok? She's showing her true colours and it ain't a pretty picture, OP.", "YTA- you could have walked jess down the aisle then gone back to the hospital. It really sounds like you have a history of favoring penny over jess. You mention you're the only father penny has ever had but what about jess? Does she have another father? Have you ever been there for her?", "NTA\n\nLife hanging in the balance absolutely takes precedence over a wedding.", "NTA. You were exactly where you needed to be. If your bio daughter was in the same situation you were have been at the hospital for her.", "NTA - and Jess is an AH. Yes a wedding is an important day, it celebrates a beginning and is for family and friends. \n\nBut it does not decide everything in life. It is a luxury and a gift to have a beautiful wedding, but it is not essential for a love/ marriage and a family - many bridzillas forget that.\n\nThis was about the death and life of your daughter. Of course you go to the hospital! Of course you stay there and by her side and support your wife. It could well have been a goodbye.\n\nI wish your one daughter a good recovery and your other daughter more humility and compassion.", "YTA\n\nYour lack of answering questions, plus your daughter's comments, led me to the conclusion this had happened before.\n\nMaybe you feel like a hero to your stepdaughter, so you always put her first. Who knows.\n\nYou couldn't help this situation, but you obviously have a deep problem with being a father to your daughter. You've probably lost her. You don't seem capable of doing what she would need to allow you back into her life.", "YTA, why couldn\u2019t you walk her then leave after the ceremony? I really hope your step daughter pulls through, because she\u2019s your only daughter now", "NTA. I was nearly killed in a car accident, my sister was at the hospital that night and every day for the month after while I was in a coma. Fair enough the two don't get along, but to want to leave somebody laying dying in the hospital all alone? That's nor okay, she doesn't have to go to the hospital if she doesn't want to, but she has no right to tell other people they're wrong for going.", "NTA", "NTA. A wedding is an important party, but a party nonetheless. Someone hospitalized may literally die because someone wasn\u2019t there to make sure they get the care they need.", "With the context you've provided, NTA. It was a sucky situation, however I cannot fault you for running to your daughter's side once you found out. All the other commenters saying that you should've stayed and let your wife go don't seem to understand that when a loved one is that touch and go, that critical, any moment could be a goodbye. I would've made the same decision and I would've wanted my parents to make the same desicion, god forbid that ever happen. \n\nYour daughter is valid in how she feels, however her wedding is insignificant compared to this medical emergency. I sympathise, however this is not a competition. She cares that you walked your other daughter down the aisle first and that she won't get the chance. She's allowed to feel sad, but being jealous over something like this when her step sister is fighting for her life? not a good look. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope your daughter recovers and your other daughter comes around to you.

You need to ask what that was about.", "YTA. You had plenty of time to walk your daughter down the aisle.", "NAH. The only thing I would have done differently is leave my wife at the hospital and head to the wedding, be part of the ceremony and then head back to hospital after explaining the situation to my daughter.", "NAH.\n\nThis is such a complicated situation and I can't imagine being put in this position. You had to choose between walking your one daughter down the aisle and potentially saying goodbye to your other daughter. Both are momentous occasions in someone's life. While it is sad that you missed out on walking your daughter down the aisle, you would have been there physically but you wouldn't have been *present*. Your other daughter was fighting for her life and you didn't know if you would ever see her alive again. Not getting to say goodbye can be earth-shattering and something that you might not come back from emotionally.\n\nThat being said, your older daughter was entitled to her reaction, especially if there have been other occasions in her life where you put your younger daughter first. Also, her anger may be masking tremendous disappointment. Anger is a lot easier to connect to on a primal level than disappointment. I like what someone else said about potentially having a dinner for the newlyweds where y'all have a father daughter dance and see about making up any missed wedding photos, on your dime. Your relationship may never recover from this, but you did what you felt was right at the time. I hope though that in time your older daughter can see that you were in an untenable position.", "NTA. It could have been you in that car accident, would Jess still pitch a fit then? A wedding is one moment in a lifetime, it really has little standing in the overall picture of life. I'm sure you weren't happy about missing the opportunity but my gosh, your other daughter could have DIED. \n\nThe good news is, you made the right decision. Trust me, I know how important it is to have your father walk you down the aisle. But this was out of your control. Jess can be upset, she can be angry, but it wasn't your fault. Hopefully she will realise her overreaction at you.", "I think it's kind of telling that he hasn't responded to any questions pertaining to this.

It was his stepdaughter who was in the accident.", "Exactly, this is a damned if you do and damned if you don't situation, there's no way he was winning this.", "this sub is full of psychos", "I have a feeling he's lost Jess after this.", "Yes I want to hear the answern to this too.", "Thank you!", "I am also wondering why he called Jesse instead of calling her mother or her groom or even a cousin or someone about him not attending. Someone else giving the news gently would have possibly went a lot better than the OP calling the already stressed out bride and then expecting her to immediately be concerned about someone she has no relationship with.", "His wife\u2019s daughter was potentially dying. A wedding doesn\u2019t compare.", "Penny is just as much as his daughter as Jess is as per the post and she was potentially on her death bed, why wouldnt he be focused on that?!", ">His stepdaughter\n\nThis is irrelevant, Penny is his daughter.", "Trying to imply that OP should be less important because shes not biologically related? Dont do that.", "If this was a one time thing, i'd say he made the right choice, but jess's reaction makes me wonder if this is typical of him, to favor penny.", "Apparently", "No, I think that's exactly fair, as a bride I would also like to hear it directly from my father. Otherwise it would have been cowardly of him.", "Plus he should have called in the moment the crash happened to let someone know what was up", "I'd like to know if his wife would have abandoned Penny's wedding if Jess was injured.", "I feel like everyone else in these replies are fucking insane! *His daughter might have been dying!* There is no universe in which anyone's wedding is more important than your child's life. Holy shit these replies are *unhinged!*", "Even so, why not split the tasks? Especially when the parents aren't even next of kin any more", "He says the police would not give him info about the severity.", "So is Jess. What else has OP missed that's important to Jess? I bet we never find out as he won't reply", "Even if she's his biodaughter, if he has a history of favoring one child over the other, this may be the straw that broke the camel's back.", "Now that I am thinking about it..Penny is married so why were the police calling OP and his wife? The police would call the husband unless the husband was also in the car. OP only mentions the husband when stating he walked Penny down the aisle but makes no further mention of him at all.", "Why?", "Welcome to AITA. Hell, reddit in general", "And then implying she\u2019s somehow less important because she\u2019s his stepdaughter. Its callous.", "Because the last thing youd be thinking about if your child was potentially dying would be\u2026oh idk, partying?", "You have no children right?", "Do you expect she would rush to Jess's bedside, or maybe stay behind as she's hosting the wedding and it would be rude...", "I think Penny has always been OPs focus. Even now", "He didn't need to stay for the reception, he could have just walked jess down the aisle then left after the ceremony. It sounds like they were just sitting in a waiting room most of the time anyway.", "2 daughters. I'm deadly serious.", "To be with her husband who might lose his child? Yes, I think any normal person would do that.\nStrange that you don't see it that way...", "Okay but we\u2019re judging an actual situation that happened  - not a string of hypotheticals.", "Well shit she should be the focus when she is in the ICU in a life or death situation", "So a wedding is more important then a death/life situation for you? If she would have died, and he couldn\u2018t say goodbye it would have been better?!? \nAs a mom this seems crazy and heartless.", "Sure, and If it were my girls the whole wedding would be postponed as the bride would rush to the hospital with us.\n\nI'd like confirmation of that from OP", "Fair enough, but this post smacks of consistent favouritism, something about the way OP says he's Penny's only father figure.  What if rhe tables were reversed?", "Not to mention failing to be by his wife\u2019s side to support her and help.", "As a mum I'd want both my daughters supported and loved. \n\nMy question to OP is what if rhe tables were reversed? If Jess had an accident I'm pretty sure his wife would have stayed at the wedding with Penny to support and comfort her daughter.", "Agree there's something else going on that we are not being told about, but I hate to speculate what.  I think he could have made an effort to go to the hospital and still come back for walking his daughter down the aisle.", "Exactly! What an AH-husband-move that would be\u2026", "That is an interpretation, and a rather blatant one at that. Why would she not want to go to the hospital to support her husband who might lose his child? On the basis of what evidence do you believe that? Just because the stepmother doesn't have a close relationship with Jess doesn't mean you don't care or hate each other. Especially in a life-threatening situation."]}
