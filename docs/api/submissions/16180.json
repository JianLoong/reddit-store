This was a first for me from them", "Ya it should make me feel more safe but the fact that this happened just makes me wanna give up. It was already so hard for me going to the gym that I ruin my sleeping schedule just so there\u2019s less people in there \n\nBut I\u2019m happy they took action and I will try to keep going :)", "Sounds like a supportive gym. Just know every person in there was once new to the gym as well. \n\nKeep it up and you'll find that the gym will become more comfortable to you as you get more comfortable in your own skin.\n\nYou can do it OP!", "It wasn't the gym environment that caused it. You already had experience of these girls from school so that trouble followed you in. They are now removed and the strangers who are most of the people in the gym couldn't care less about you. So please keep going and improving yourself. But NTA.\n\nYou didn't get the girls banned. They did by sending nasty messages. And that isn't something you should have to put up with.", "Don't give up.", "Keep going, the problems are gone. Also get new friends, yours sou d awful.", "DUDE! You stood up for yourself after a soul punching experience.  That takes WAY more balls than turning up to the gym.\n\nI'm so impressed you told the manager.  I probs would have just run home crying and cancelled my membership on the spot.  You completely advocated for yourself.  You can absolutely keep going to the gym.  You're deserving of self care and you fucking earn those work outs. Go out there and kill it man!", "\"Snitching\" doesn't exist outside of school and maybe gang life. Adults don't care about snitching. That's for children. The gym handled the harassment appropriately, and the girls learned a lesson about behavior.", "Keep going! Improve your health by going to the gym every other day like you were! That gym is awesome for supporting you by banning them! Don\u2019t feel bad AT ALL! You did nothing wrong, all the wrong doing was by those AHs!", "Don't  quit the Gym and don't  give up.  You are stronger than this and can do it.  Why let them win.  You aren't a snitch.  You paid for your membership and went at a time you least expected to be bothered.  You did the right thing and your friends are in the wrong.  You had every right to stand up for yourself and the Gym  handled it properly. Ignore & block the unknown calls. Change the time you go and see if that helps.  Sadly you will he faced with other incidents like this.  Don't let them hold you back.  You have nothing to be embarrassed about.  Be proud if yourself for going.  I'm proud if you.  Keep up the good work!+", "Think of it this way: If you stop going, those bigots win. Keep going and you'll be giving them the one-finger salute.", "I can tell you no one really cares about what you do in the gym.  No one is paying attention. Have good gym etiquette, workout and leave.", "If your feelings tell you that, then your feeling are not on your side. Learn to move past them.", "Keep all the Evidence they\u2019ve been doing it\u2019ll help with a RO. Having that stuff pile shows how crazy they are.", "That\u2019s true. I haven\u2019t truly experienced the gym environment since I go at 2 am and there\u2019s usually only 5-10 people haha it\u2019s more my fear and anxiety of working out in front of people. Thank you and thank you to everyone else :))", "You know most people in the gym don't even notice others, right? They are so focused on themselves that they aren't looking around judging others. \n\nIt's ok to be new at something. Regular gym goers might think 'good for you, keep coming back' IF they think about you at all, which is unlikely. \n\nKeep going!", "Consider joining a YMCA if there is one nearby. I know the hours are a bit limited compared to 24 hour ones, but people are older usually, less competitive and nicer. From my perspective at least.", "If you can afford it, I\u2019d also get a few personal trainer sessions, will give you a programme to really focus on :) and a bit of support"]}
