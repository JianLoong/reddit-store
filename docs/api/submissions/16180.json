Anyway, I saved it and showed the worker and they just told me they are going to deal with it. Today I got a text message from the girl saying I\u2019m a snitch and I got her banned from the gym. I keep getting unknown calls too and I think it\u2019s them. I told my friends and they told me I should\u2019ve left without snitching\n\nI definitely don\u2019t feel accepted in the gym environment now and I\u2019m thinking of canceling my membership.

Block all fucked up messages sent, they're homophobes. Fuck 'em.\n\nIt's easier to leave. And I would never blame you for doing that. We all have our limits of what we can handle in the current moment and if this is too much PLEASE do what is best for you and doesn't make you feel unsafe and unhappy \n\nYour gym would rather have you than people who vocally tear down others! Whoever is shitting on you about being the tattler is also a dick. \n\nSo I hope that if you decide that you're too upset about what happened there and decide not to go back you will let them know (and maybe leave a review) but I also hope you will be able to take heart in the rejection of bigots and remember that some businesses do give a fuck about you.", ">I feel horrible for getting them banned now and people are telling me I shouldn\u2019t have snitched \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d \n\nYou didn't get them banned.

Just make sure to thank that worker when you leave because he did the right thing. Ignore the people telling you to turn the other cheek. You're the one dealing with it, not them, so you get to decide how to handle it, and you handled yourself way better than I would have.", "NTA, the gym is one of those places where you will find the kindest and super supportive people.

The gym is a place for self improvement. If they're there to be hurtful and bring people down they can fuck off.\n\nAlso keep at it. I just started at the gym again and I'm loving it. You'll smash ya goals!", "People who use the word snitch are cowards. If you don't think what your doing is wrong you would own it", "NTA.  You are valid and important. They were harassing you. If they didn\u2019t want to have consequences for their actions they shouldn\u2019t do things that have consequences. Good for you for standing up for yourself and establishing healthy routines for continual growth.", "NTA\n\nHey mate,\n\n1. You did nothing wrong. \n\n2. You need to find better friends. \n\n3. It's not a snitching when YOU are the victim.\n\n4. Your gym is certainly doing things to make it a better place. They banned the girl. So please don't give up. Your gym sounds to be a good place if they are taking action so promptly and it's not just warning unlike some other gyms. They listened to your feelings. I'm sure you can find much better friends in gym.", "NTA. \n\nFirstly, you didn\u2019t get them banned, their homophobic bullying did. \n\nSecondly, you didn\u2019t only protect yourself, but do you truly believe that you are the only \u2018target\u2019 they have there?

You simply told an employee someone was sending homophobic slurs to you. They dealt with it as they saw fit. \n\nThe girls and your friends are in the wrong. You have every right to feel safe at the gym. They made it unsafe and got banned .That's a them problem not a you problem.", "NTA. Not at all.", "NTA.  You did the exact right thing.  That crap shouldn\u2019t be tolerated and those girls deserved to be banned.   Walking away and not saying anything is the worst advice your supposed friends can give you.", "NTA, bullies rely on you not telling people or putting their behavior under a spotlight, you were just showing them that their hateful actions and words have consequences.\n\n And anyways, it sounds like that behavior is normal for them, so maybe you've preemptively stopped them from bullying others at that gym. If you don't feel comfortable there anymore, you should definitely change gyms, but I would feel good about that being one place they now can't spread their toxicity. \n\nAlso your friends sound like AH why are they taking her side, when you were the one being bullied? I think you did the right thing speaking to management, walking away would've made you feel like crap, and confronting her on the spot would have made things messy, quietly speaking to management was the way to go. Good job for standing up for yourself in a non-escalating way.", "NTA! Don\u2019t let them deter your hard work. Sometimes you have to find a gym that has the right people and eventually become some of your best friends. You got this!", "NTA.\n\nThose girls are such creeps.", "NTA. You didn't get them banned. They got themselves banned for being homophobic bullies. You have every right to go to the gym and workout without being harassed. Don't let a bunch of mean girls get in the way of that. I'm proud of you for making the commitment to sticking to a routine of self care. You're doing something so good for yourself. Don't let AHs steal your thunder.", "NTA who tf said you should not have snitched? Anyway it isnt a friend.", "NTA.  You did the right thing and should not give it a second thought.  They harassed you.  It is no different than if they had sent you a racial epithet to get you out.  Your friends are either cowards or not good friends at all for their advice.", "NTA. It\u2019s also not snitching. I really hate that term. It\u2019s you calling out their disgusting and toxic behavior. Your friends being telling you to keep quiet are not helping. The girls were being AHs and I\u2019m glad you reported it. \n\nIf anything, you should be glad she got herself banned for her behavior and at least you know the gym will back you up and try to make it comfortable for you to workout.  Don\u2019t cancel the membership. \n\nIf your friends don\u2019t understand the hurtful behavior, reevaluate those friendships too. Your feelings are COMPLETELY VALID and understandable.", "NTA \n\nyou are paying to use a gym, they should take your safety and comfort serious. \nif they harassed you, who is to keep them from pushing boundaries with other people, ie taking pictures or shaming people.\n\nyou did the right thing, certain things are a privilege and if you fuck up then thats on them.", "NTA. What kind of person uses a homophobic slur in literal 2023? They got themselves banned by their behavior. And you have no duty to not snitch on someone who aren't your friends and they clearly aren't and never were your friends. So I'm not seeing why anyone would expect you not to 'snitch' on them.", "NTA \u2014 You have been getting harassed. Are they going to hound everyone they think/know/assume is gay? Congratulations for getting them forced to leave when they\u2019re the ones who wanted you to leave!", "NTA, they are bullies asnd you did the right thing. It wasn't you who got them banned it was their own actions. And congratulations to you working out in gym, it takes courage to show in place like this.", "NTA\n\nI hate mean girls. I'm very glad the gym had your back.\n\nYou matter.", "NTA\nyou did the right thing, those immature girls were harassing you, the only ones to blame for being banned from that gym are themselves", "NTA even in the slightest. Those girls are immature and need the face the consequences of their actions.

Oh no!  Wow! I wonder why they did that? Could it be because you're a homophobe bully? Or maybe because you harass other gym members? Naw, that's impossible, because you always mind your own business and treat others with respect! Gosh, we'll miss you! Ta ta!\"", "NTA\n\nYou need new friends. If I was the victim of deliberate homophobia and someone told me I should have just tolerated it they wouldnt have a place in my life anymore.", "I actually didn\u2019t talk to management. There\u2019s only one worker at night and it\u2019s like a teenager haha I guess he told management! It was a surprise to me they actually did something tbh"]}
