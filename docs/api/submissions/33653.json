{"id": 33653, "submission_id": "18per1d", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay at a restaurant", "selftext": "Couple of days ago, I went out for dinner with some friends at a local spot that's known for it's reasonably priced alcohol. We spent around 3 hours at this place ordering food and drinking alcohol. It was a weekday night, so the restaurant wasn't packed, yet we had to call out to the waiters multiple times to remind them of our orders. The food also wasn't very great, barring one or two dishes, and was mostly bland (fish and chips and chicken wings were the worst of the lot). We finally called for the bill around midnight. \n\nWhile going through the bill, my friend and I noticed that they had tacked on an additional service charge for both the food and alcohol. Now here's the point. The restaraunt puts up in bold that they levy a 10% service charge, which would be considered fine, if the literal government had not come up with a law stating that paying service charge is no longer mandatory and one can ask for it to be removed from bill. Since we ordered quite a bit of food and alcohol, the service charge was also substantial (around $11-12). Now where we are, thats quite a hefty amount, and this was on top of the tax for alcohol we had to pay.\n\nWhile two of my friends didn't care about the service charge, me and the guy who went through the bill asked for it to be removed. The waiter then told us that we had to ask for it to be removed before the bill comes, which is bogus considering the norm is to usually ask to remove the service charge AFTER the bill arrives. When we argue with him, he then asks us if the service was bad and why we want to remove the service charge  My friend then gives in and says that let's just pay the service charge, stating that they've been working for midnight so it's fine. However, I stand my ground and say that it isn't fine for them to argue with us about this when it isn't compulsory, more so when the service wasnt the best (it wasn't bad, but for a not-so-packed restaurant, we had to call them multiple times to come to our table and they served the same dish twice as well). My friends told me that arguing wasn't worth it as it was not a big deal, and I got outvoted 3-1 when it came to paying the extra. A couple of days later, when I asked a couple of other people if I was in the wrong, one said that I was acting entitled, while another said that while I wasn't completely wrong, I had to stop fighting with everyone and needed to resolve it amicably. So AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: No, tipping doesn't exist where I am from. Yes, people usually ask to remove the service charge over here when presented with the bill and if service charge is mentioned.", "created_utc": 1703364687, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18per1d/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_at_a_restaurant/", "score": 94, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
