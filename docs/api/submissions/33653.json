{"id": 33653, "submission_id": "18per1d", "title": "AITA for refusing to pay at a restaurant", "selftext": "Couple of days ago, I went out for dinner with some friends at a local spot that's known for it's reasonably priced alcohol. We spent around 3 hours at this place ordering food and drinking alcohol. It was a weekday night, so the restaurant wasn't packed, yet we had to call out to the waiters multiple times to remind them of our orders. The food also wasn't very great, barring one or two dishes, and was mostly bland (fish and chips and chicken wings were the worst of the lot). We finally called for the bill around midnight. \n\nWhile going through the bill, my friend and I noticed that they had tacked on an additional service charge for both the food and alcohol. Now here's the point. The restaraunt puts up in bold that they levy a 10% service charge, which would be considered fine, if the literal government had not come up with a law stating that paying service charge is no longer mandatory and one can ask for it to be removed from bill. Since we ordered quite a bit of food and alcohol, the service charge was also substantial (around $11-12). Now where we are, thats quite a hefty amount, and this was on top of the tax for alcohol we had to pay.\n\nWhile two of my friends didn't care about the service charge, me and the guy who went through the bill asked for it to be removed. The waiter then told us that we had to ask for it to be removed before the bill comes, which is bogus considering the norm is to usually ask to remove the service charge AFTER the bill arrives. When we argue with him, he then asks us if the service was bad and why we want to remove the service charge  My friend then gives in and says that let's just pay the service charge, stating that they've been working for midnight so it's fine. However, I stand my ground and say that it isn't fine for them to argue with us about this when it isn't compulsory, more so when the service wasnt the best (it wasn't bad, but for a not-so-packed restaurant, we had to call them multiple times to come to our table and they served the same dish twice as well). My friends told me that arguing wasn't worth it as it was not a big deal, and I got outvoted 3-1 when it came to paying the extra. A couple of days later, when I asked a couple of other people if I was in the wrong, one said that I was acting entitled, while another said that while I wasn't completely wrong, I had to stop fighting with everyone and needed to resolve it amicably. So AITA in this situation?\n\nEDIT: No, tipping doesn't exist where I am from. Yes, people usually ask to remove the service charge over here when presented with the bill and if service charge is mentioned.\n\nEDIT 2: This is not the USA, Canada, Europe or Australia, it's an Asian country. I used $ signifying USD because I know that's the currency most people would be able to relate to. Also, quite a few people said that I inconvenienced my friends by arguing. This whole situation lasted less than 2 minutes, and was a forgotten afterthought once we left the restaurant.

Ditto at the Chinese buffet where we tip 10% as very little service is provided. We normally just hand the cash to the wait staff when we're leaving.", "Is there anywhere in the US that has a law about removing service charges? (Genuinely curious, since once I saw that I automatically guessed they weren't in the US.) \n\nEither way, I kind of disagree. People on this sub have a really bad habit of making assumptions when the 'INFO' option is literally right there. Expecting every single person posting here to just magically 'know' that Reddit will assume they're from the US is peak American-centrism, too.", "While it's true America is the most represented country on reddit, it's less than 50% of users. So no, most redditors are from outside of America.\n\nI also got the feeling that he isn't from America, mainly due to the price for 3 hrs of eating and drinking.", "[removed]", "The world doesn\u2019t revolve around you. Maybe Americans should learn to default to everything online NOT being American.", "And the US (not including all the countries that use US currency)  has about 9x the population of those two countries added together. So sheer statistical probability....", "So let's take into account the population of those places and  percentage of English fluency, of all those places added together vs the US. \n\nAnd there has yet to be any definitive statement suggesting exactly which place is being mentioned. \n\nSo I will let statistical data do it for me", "Service charge \u2260 tip", "It doesn't have to be a tradition to give someone money for a service. I doubt someone will turn down 5 usd because there culture didn't tell them to", "this depends on the location and the system used. the place i work adds an automatic 20% for large parties and it is listed as \"service charge 20%.\" we obviously explain it to the parties that it is an automatic gratuity, but it's listed as a service charge nonetheless", "My man felt justified and I did too in that moment but after I felt so guilty but the way she was hovering and slamming things had me super uncomfortable.", "She was very entitled and according to the reviews it wasn't the first time either.", "Don't know. I've never seen a service charge unless it's a really large party and multiple staff are required to service the group. But we are notified in advance and it's posted in writing. I'm in the USA and have only had to pay this two times off the top of my head. I get why it's required for large parties so I've never had a problem with it.", "Then literally every judgement would have to be \u201cINFO\u201d.", "I'm not entirely agreeing with OP, but he said most reddit users are American, not everyone online. And, he is right about that. About half of reddit traffic comes from the U.S. with the U.K. coming in at second with about 8%.\n\nI do agree with you that it's obvious to tell this didn't happen in the U.S.", "Sorry, we can't hear you over the sound of all this freedom ringing!", "Funny, if you use US dollars in the OP, people are going to believe it's in the US, especially not given any information suggesting otherwise", "I said majority of *reddit*, not the entire internet. \n\nGoddamn, European schools are supposed to be better than American public schools, I thought they actually taught reading comprehension over there?", "Again, it's just statistics. The site is mostly Americans. The default assumption is Americans because that's where most Redditors are.", "But statistically Americans can\u2019t write as well as OP so no", "They would, and they do. Why would you need to pay someone extra for doing their job? Serving a table for 3 hours or serving 4 different tables over 3 hours is no different, the waiters etc are doing their job and get paid to do it. Not everyone is from America and thank fuck for that.", "Sure, but you inferred he was an indecent human being by not doing so which is completely wrong.", "I mean obviously due to the character limit sometimes people just have to go with what is written. But in this case a pretty obvious question would be 'is tipping normal where you are' because that weighs hugely in the judgment. \n\nThe other day there was a post where the commenter talked about the OP's daughter being 'out all day shopping' when actually they'd been out for two hours. If the length of time was relevant to their judgment then *that* would be a scenario where they could ask INFO rather than just running with an assumption. \n\nIt's amazing how many times people make (wrong) assumptions and get thousands of upvotes for it, and then the correction gets ignored or isn't taken into account by the top comment because so many people just drop judgments and don't ever come back.", "There are other countries that use the dollar sign you know.\nr/USdefaultism", "The US is he most represented country on reddit, but it's under 50%. So no, the majority of reddit is not from the US.", "And what evidence do you have for that? Oh again nothing. Just throwing out more hate without proof.", "There are, but again the story doesn't line up with those places. But by all means, prove me wrong", "Doesn't the price for 3 hours of eating and drinking indicate somewhere cheaper than the US?", "The standard tip is more than 10% in the US, and I'm not aware of any governments in the US that have recently highly publicly legislatied around service charges. It was very obvious they weren't American. I thought Australia at first, since they have controls on additional services charges being tracked on without customer's being informed, but apparently not so it's likely Singapore, who fit everything mentioned.", "Singapore?"]}
