Recently, my brother and parents got into a petty fight that has needlessly escalated and they are basically not on speaking terms.

I asked if I could at least swing by to just drop off the gifts, and he said I should just mail them instead. I told him I would prefer not to mail them, since it's a hassle and expensive to package everything and mail them (especially since one item is fragile), and said I would just hold on to them until the next time I see them, whenever that might be.
