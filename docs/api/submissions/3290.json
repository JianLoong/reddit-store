My marriage is great right now, so now idea why we need counseling. I had a great childhood and my mom wasn't even with Rose's dad at the time.

It sounds to me like she was choosing responses that would avoid Rose having a meltdown at the party, so she could stay and enjoy her grandson's party.  A brat like Rose probably behaves far worse when told no.  Teens like her are prone to smashing things when they dont get what they want and although most 15 year olds can be left alone at home, Rose probably can't be.

Is you mum usually like that- I feel for you if she has always been that kind of way- or has this husband played everyone off against each other, now leaving your mum trapped raising a brat (although sounds like this is all pretty much the dad\u2019s doing)? What do you think of your stepdad?", "My interpretation:  Mom said yes as a way to keep Rose behaving, like a bargain, you behave at the party and I will take you to Michaels.  If mom said no, Rose may have started throwing things.  \"Telling dad\" is Rose trying to exert power over her step mom, it was a threat from a brat whose dad always takes her side.  Plus it is likely dad that doesnt like his wife spending time with her family and bad mouths not OPs mom. And the final straw, mom laughing was probably because mom actually hates Rose.  The only thing she could do was laugh at the ridiculousness of the question. Mom is trying to survive Rose not parent her. It is way too late for a step parent to fix Rose, only her parents have that ability or professional therapists", "I can't stand him. He thinks he's better than me because he was running a company at 19. All he did was get born into the right family, have his father disowned, and his grandfather die. He is extremely reactive and hates my guts because he claims I've hurt my mother. He can't really be around me anymore because he can't control his emotions apparently. However I do think his ex is worse when it comes to parenting and she is more to blame. My mom is difficult but not usually manipulative. She just really wanted another child"]}
