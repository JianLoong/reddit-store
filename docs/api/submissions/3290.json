You were supposed to coddle the brat, rather than support your wife? A 15 year old girl who needs to learn sooner than later that her current attitude will get her only so far in life? Yeah, your grandparents really do have a point, she says sarcastically.\n\nNo you are NTA. If anything your mother should be ashamed of herself for not caring about her grandson enough to shut her stepdaughter's shit down.", "NTA\nRose is awful", "NTA. People seem to think \u201cbut they\u2019re family\u201d should cover all abuse and I just don\u2019t understand. I can\u2019t see myself allowing anyone to make my child\u2019s mother uncomfortable at the child\u2019s bday party", "NTA. Rose should never be around y\u2019all again !", "NTA but I wouldn\u2019t let rose or your mother over anymore . Rose was rude and mean for no reason , your mom allowed it  and you are so used to your mom acting this way it\u2019s normal to you.", "NTA", "Everybody sucks here. Rose sounds like a brat, BUT her relationship with your mom is not your business. Neither is her marriage. You should have acted like an adult and ignored Rose; your mom should have told Rose to shut up. Instead you made a bigger deal out of it than this was worth. Do you REALLY care that much about what a stupid kid says, for the love of God??? You have a real issue now.", "NTA - Rose was creating a lot of issues and needed to be asked to stop by so one.\nBut poor Rose - she's in competition with a baby about being loved and she views love in purely materialistic terms. You spent X on baby so need to spend more of me to show her she's loved. She's living with a Disney Dad and constant indulgence likely tailed off. Why did she leave her Mum's? Suggest to your mother that she get her into therapy.", "\u2026why are there so many MILs with sensory food issues?", "ARE YOU KIDDING, you are SO NTA. Your family sounds like a nightmare. Good luck to you, your wife, and your baby. I hope you can all have a very happy life together despite those ridiculous folk.", "Oh good another fake MIL post complete with a birthday party and mystery food sensory issues. At least she's not sitting in her petulant second husband's lap this time!", "She is!!! \n\nAnd I hate these sentences like \u201cthey\u2019re just a teenager\u201d or \u201cthey\u2019re just kids\u201d or \u201cboys will be boys\u201d (in other cases) whatsoever. \n\nThose are just very petty, unacceptable excuses. \n\nYes, puberty is hard. Yes, hormones can be confusing. \n\nNo, this is still not a free pass to treat everyone else like shit. \n\nEven teenagers are old enough to understand what decent behavior is and what isn\u2019t and that their words and actions have consequences on others. That their words and actions can hurt others. \n\nThey should know so as teenagers just as much as kids should already know that. Even smaller kids can and should learn that other people have feelings too. \n\nIf someone doesn\u2019t know this stuff as a teenager at all, then this isn\u2019t due to being a teen. It\u2019s due to the fact that they haven\u2019t learned or known that beforehand to begin with and that is just poor parenting. \n\nHuman beings don\u2019t turn 18 and are all of the sudden reasonable, responsible, well-behaved grown-up adults. \n\nYou grow into being an adult by learning. \n\nParents who refuse to parent just because \u201cthey\u2019re kids\u201d whatsoever and \u201cthat they will grow out of it eventually\u201d totally fail at their job as a parent. \n\nAnd this is how we end up having adults who are absolutely nasty and unpleasant to be around with. It\u2019s others, at work, at the gym etc., who do have to put up with a nasty adult that isn\u2019t an adult, but just a huge un-parented, misbehaved baby in the body of an adult. \n\nNo one is doing their kids a favor by spoiling them rotten or not parenting them at all. It makes their kids turn into this adult no one wants to interact with. Because they\u2019re spoiled, misbehaved, not self-reflective at all and do not know how to cope with anything because they never had to, leading them to not have developed any coping strategies. \n\n\nRose is awful, her parents are awful and you had every right to throw her out!!!", "I don\u2019t think there was any abuse but her mom seems to only love her husband and doesn\u2019t like being a mother. She\u2019s also very emotional and hot and cold. Rose probably has to realize that we are in a liberal state where 50/50 is the default and her dad chose to only have her on the weekends. He definitely loves her but is only interested in the fun stuff and pays a lot more attention to my mom. My moms the only person who seems to actively want her. She likes her stepdad a lot too. I don\u2019t think she respects her parents because they are both so emotional and immature", "My moms the one who wanted custody and bribed Rose into moving. She knew at that point she\u2019d be doing most of the work. She seems happy", "That is not your business. That relationship is up to your mom, and you should stay out of it.", "I\u2019m really curious what \u201cdaddy\u201d is gonna do with all these tattled tales??!!  Like WTH is she even telling him and from the sounds of it it doesn\u2019t sound like this guy gives much of a shit about anything, so what is he gonna do, not allow Mom and Rose to go to OP\u2019s anymore?  Hallelujah!!", "That is a tough position to be in. I am wondering if she is feeling very insecure about her own status in the world and is feeling rejected by her parents. It isn\u2019t your responsibility, but I would encourage you to talk to your mom about getting Rose into therapy. It sounds like she would really benefit processing all of those emotions instead of coping by creating an unhealthily dependent relationship with her step mom. The whole asking if she likes the baby more seems so deeply upsetting, like it is coming from a place of feeling no one in the world loves her and is so insecure about that. She shouldn\u2019t act the way she does but it seems to be a result of issues and situations shoved upon her that aren\u2019t her fault. She is just a kid and needs help managing that", "I can\u2019t control them. I know my wife should try but I can\u2019t control every little thing my own mom says or does either", "WHy didn't you kick them out?", "Because that would have hurt my wife and I don\u2019t like being petty", "OP=NTA\n\nYour mother is a lousy grandmother. I was ready to say a gift for a 1yr old isn't a big deal-kid would be happy with anything a step up from a chew toy.  But it shows a lack of care for you and family.\n\nY'all should rename Rose--Dudley Dursley.  I could almost feel sorry for your MIL, because I wouldn't want to have to put up with that spoiled brat.\n\nIf she couldn't control the brat and who was making lousy comments about your Wife's food(and the love me more garbage) then asking them to leave was reasonable.  Why should you wife be forced to HOST these females?  It's not like you could send Rose home WITHOUT your mother.", "Rose is a piece of work, isn't she?\n\nI'd be banning her until she learns some manners.", "NTA. Thank you for standing up for your wife.", "NTA - thing is even though your mom \u201cdidn\u2019t do much\u201d that is a big part of the problem. She didn\u2019t do anything to shut her step daughter\u2019s comments down, didn\u2019t tell her she was being rude, didn\u2019t even think to leave her SD at home while she attended the party. I\u2019m glad you did what you had to for your wife and child, but please remember that her not doing much is the problem.", "NTA... but I bet Rose is going to learn some harsh truths about the world when she leaves the bubble nest. I know a relative who was raised without any discipline whatsoever and she barely got a job at 50 and no one really wants to be around her", "NTA You need to remember that your wife and baby are your priority. Rose needs Boot Camp.", "YOUR MOTHER IS IN AN ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP", "ESH Sure Rose sounds bratty but you are all too toeing around her. If she is just a kid, you can correct her behaviour. If she is nearing adulthood, you can be blunt and tell her that her behaviour is inappropriate. Use your words!", "OP's mum is about to learn what happens when you're caring for an unparented child: you stop getting invited. It's one of the strangest experiences I've had as a parent that some of your friends/family become too much work because their parenting style doesn't fit with yours. It's hard.", "...Good effin' riddance.", "I have to disagree. What happens in 5-10 years when the OP's baby can understand what is being said. When Rose pulls this \"do you like me more than OP's baby?\" and everyone just ignores it?? That doesn't work. That's not something you let slide.", "Why would she just ignore it?? That\u2019s what everyone does and that\u2019s why rose is such a btch. they need to go low/no contact.", "My mom bribed her to leave her moms. She wanted custody for some reason and promised her gourmet food and unlimited rides to Michaels. The mom does sound like kind of a mess but it really came down to the bribery", "And where are you getting that from? My mom not caring that rose acts this way is in no way an indicator of abuse. My moms the one who wanted custody", "I refuse to deal with the fall out of what her father would say to us if I did that and it isn\u2019t my job. I\u2019m still half expecting for him to call me and blow up when he hears my mom didn\u2019t eat", "Exactly. Rose knows how to get her way without consequences and make people around her miserable in order to do so. NTA. No way to be around that creature if she's not reigned in by parents.", "No that\u2019s not what everyone is doing.  Rose\u2019s dad is giving in, MIL is reporting the stories to OP or OP is observing, and on baby\u2019s first bday OP and wife are preoccupied by this.  Literally *no one* has tried not accommodating Rose and also being so over it she is a nonfactor, including bystanders who cared if she was thrown out.  \nThis is why ESH.  \nThat does not mean they shouldn\u2019t reduce contact.  They might.  Or maybe they should visit only at a coffee shop while Rose is at school.", "For no good reason?! Unless I missed something, OP and his wife ignored MIL and Rose the whole time and didn't fuel it until they took it too far. Why do they have to tolerate such behaviour in their own house just to try to teach a girl a lesson when she hasn't enjoyed good parenting in her whole life?! \n\nMy son turned one earlier this year and his first birthday was very special to me. I could have ignored such behaviour every other day, but not that day.", "Rose sounds like a rich but neglected kid who is acting out; I honestly feel bad for. I think many commenters are forgetting that this is a 14 year old kid. She seems rather unpleasant, but it sounds like OP's mom realized that this kid desperately needed some love, attention, and to feel wanted. Hopefully, OP's mom can help nurture her, teach her some boundaries, get her the support of a mental healthcare professional and hopefully curve that AH mentality before she becomes an adult.", "I can't imagine anyone wanting Rose's type of personality anywhere near them. \n\nRose is financially abusive", "Yeah but they don't have to tolerate it wt their own house while celebrating their son's first birthday (which is very special for a new parent btw)", "Found the stepdaughter", "Financially abusive? She\u2019s a teenager and they give in. They taught her to demand money. I certainly wouldn\u2019t call that an abusive relationship", "Her demanding jewelry equal to mom's engagement ring sounds like she showed up with her training already in place. The \"I'm telling daddy\" is a threat for your mom, not you.\n\nI'm adding NTA because I forgot to put that on my first comment.", "She was absolutely threatening me. She was upset because there wasn\u2019t food for my mom. She was being protective of my mom. She also didn\u2019t just show up one day. He\u2019d raised her her whole life to think demanding things was ok because he could afford them", "Geez she's a mess", "I don\u2019t think they were disrespecting his mom. I think they were happy the awful child was finally gone. Unchecked, poorly behaved children are aggravating.", "Your inlaws were cheering on when your mother and a child were getting kicked out. That's not OK. Rose may be unplesant, but she is still a child. Your inlaws are adults. Their behaviour is arguably worse in my books since they should have the benefit of maturity and self control on their side.", "NTA. Rose was shockingly rude and your mom should have told her so, not laughed with her. They both behaved badly. You were right to ask them to leave.", "NTA.

It's your wife not liking her.", "NTA if I acted like rose I\u2019d get my ass beat.", "NTA.\n\nRose is not '\"just a bratty kid.\" She's a practiced manipulator.  I'd seriously limit her access to your kid and your home. She's also a major AH. \nYour mom \"didn't do much,\" and that's exactly why she's another AH. She's enabling Rose's behavior.", "ESH. Your mom didn't have a bad attitude, Rose did, and Rose wasn't even doing anything to your wife. Rose isn't the only brat, your wife is as well. You're right, your wife IS always looking for reasons to be mad with, by the sounds of it, someone who doesn't antagonize her but merely isn't of the same mold as your wife. Maybe your mom wouldn't be with a 'lazy' man and bratty stepdaughter if her own son would grow a spine and defend her from his awful wife.", "Rose sounds like she needs therapy.

This does not help unless you enjoy being a door mat.", "Or the mother. One of those two:)", "So why didn't you kick your wife or your in-laws out? So you can't control what your mom says or does, but you'll let your wife and her family shit on her? You don't want to hurt your wife but you're fine with your wife hurting you and being petty toward you? You should really re-evaluate babying your brat of a wife so much, she's on her way to isolating you from your family and hers isn't any better.", "NTA.
