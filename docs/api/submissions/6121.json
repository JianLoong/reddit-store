I was trying to be a little more careful because I'm a bigger guy and couldn't take all those falls, and she started to get annoyed saying I wasn't ever gonna learn if I didn't take some risks \n\nThis week, we started rock climbing and were taking a class on belaying, and each time the instructor showed us a new knot, she just did it instantly right along with the coach. \n\nAnd when we were setting up to climb, she kept on being like \"no not like that\" when I was tying in and when I got frustrated she'd just reach over and redo my knots she got mad and told me that if I was holding her 40 feet up I better start paying attention. I felt frustrated and hurt because I was doing my best, I would have just preferred if she let the coach correct me\n\nI got home after climbing and told her that I was getting frustrated that just because stuff comes easy to her and she gets it instantly doesn't mean she can talk down to me.

You're jealous of your girlfriend, and you're being an asshole about her ability to learn quickly.", "YTA - so you have landed a smart amazing woman who works hard and succeeds and you have the nerve to be angry and jealous about it instead of just being grateful you get to be a part of her life.", "YTA sorry.   Climbing is serious stuff - do it wrong and someone gets hurt (or worse).  So your girlfriend attempting to correct you is perfectly okay in this environment.   Your post sounds like you are just jealous of her abilities.   You should be proud and supportive of her amazing skills.", "YTA. She just is smarter than you. Suck it up and be grateful that she still wants to be with you. As for the rock climbing debacle: Would you rather have you both kill yourselves than take directions from your girlfriend? That is extreme!", "Yta \n\nYou wanted to climb with an incorrect knot? Or did you want her to climb with an incorrect knot?  That could have killed or seriously injured one of you. And you got mad because she doesn't want someone to get injured?", "YTA. It\u2019s okay to be frustrated because stuff comes easier to her but you should be happy for your SO and you sound envious. It doesn\u2019t sound like she rubs it in and she only called you out when it was regarding her safety. Regarding everything else, she shouldn\u2019t have to be less or herself to make you feel better. Maybe look into a therapist to help change your view of the situation and know that we\u2019re all different and that\u2019s okay.", "YTA, sounds like you are jealous of your girlfriend for being so smart and picking things up easily, and then to cry about her making sure the knot is ok, would you have preferred for both of you to be injured to prove a point?", "Gentle YTA. Who do you want to be partnered up with in life?  Someone who is intelligent and competent?  Or someone who can\u2019t get out of their own way?  Life is much tougher with the second option. \n\nYour response is one of jealousy. You should be proud of her.", "YTA. \n\nThat's a whole lot of resentment and jealousy you have there. Sounds like some time for some personal improvement and individual therapy. \n\nUltimately, she's right - she's depending on you for her safety and if you don't know what you're doing then you need to speak up and ask for help.", "YTA. Stop being jealous of her and be proud. Not everyone learns the same way and at the same rate. There\u2019s a conversation you two can have but it\u2019s not her fault she learns fast.", "YTA. Sounds like you feel threatened by her being better at learning.", "Soft YTA mostly for the whole insecurity towards your girlfriend\u2019s natural ability to pick up new things. Is not something to be frustrated about, you should be proud of dating someone with a full brain in this day and age . \n\nAlso sounds like you\u2019re trying to be that couple that does everything together which is really cool on social media but doesn\u2019t work for everybody in real life. Maybe you need to do your own thing , get good at something at your own pace n build up your confidence so you can stop comparing yourself to her. You don\u2019t need to be super involved all the time, just being there and show support is enough sometimes", "Honestly just break up with her and let her find someone who appreciates her instead of resents her. YTA", "Kinda E S H, but more YTA. You should have been honest that you couldn't remember how to tie in, and called the instructor over instead of faking it because you're jealous of your gf's competency.", "Very gentle YTA. I understand exactly how you feel. Some people just don\u2019t even seem real, they\u2019re so stupidly blessed at everything, and it\u2019s hard not to resent that. I relate to that, too. I have a friend who makes me feel inferior like this. Im sorry you\u2019re feeling this way.", "ESH\n\nI feel like most of the y t a s are overlooking the fact that the girlfriend is upset with him for not picking things up as fast as her. He clarified in a comment that his mistake with the knots would have been corrected by the instructor before they ever climbed. It wouldn't have put her in danger. Even so, insulting your partner and immediately criticizing their efforts isn't the way to communicate if she's nervous about it. She could have politely said \"hey OP, I think this knot is tied a little incorrectly. Could I show you how I did mine or did you want to ask the instructor to review it again?\" I don't think she needs to pander to his insecurities or jealousy, but I also don't think she's showing him much respect or compassion. \n\nIt sounds to me like you're both frustrated with the other for not understanding each other's learning ability. She's naturally gifted and it sounds like she has a lot of practical intelligence. You take more time to pick things up and it sounds like new skills don't come as intuitively to you. I think you do sound jealous of your girlfriend, but she's also inconsiderate of the fact that you take more time to learn things. \n\nShe shouldn't belittle you and you shouldn't resent her. You need to have an open conversation about how you feel. Don't attack her for her success, but explain how her disparaging remarks make you feel. \n\nMaybe you can also reach out to her for help more in the future. Rather than being upset that she's progressing faster, ask her if she could explain something or request a little support until you catch up. You need to get over your insecurities and she needs to understand that not everyone has the same level of ability. Now if she's still belittling you for not being as quick/talented as her, then it's not on you. Have a conversation and see where it goes.", "NAH sounds like the climbing trip brought this issue to a head, and it's a tough one! It's hard on both sides, I am sure. She has probably noticed that it takes you a little longer to get things, and worries that in a crisis that requires quick-thinking she won't be able to rely on you. You probably worry that you'll feel left behind, and that your own good qualities are overshadowed.\n\n\nYet if she's with you, there must be something she values in you. What are your good qualities that you bring? For me my husband's steadiness, kindness, and good humor are my rock. Achievements come easily to me, much like your GF, but it would all be pretty hollow without love.\n\nAlso,  a lot of us quick thinkers have brains that work like \"catch and release \" fishing. I learn quick,  then let it go. But my husband jokes his brain is like Fort Knox. Its hard to get new stuff in there, but once learned its locked in forever. So as we age I find myself turning to him more and more for his repository of knowledge, just as he relys on me to grasp and interpret new things.\n\n\nI hope you too find a balance that works for you!", "Gentle YTA. It\u2019s okay to get frustrated if your girlfriend catches onto things quicker than you. That\u2019s just who she. You need to either accept this or cut her loose of you can\u2019t because it\u2019s going to breed even more resentment. Ask yourself, would you rather she dumb herself down to spare your feelings? \n\nThe rock climbing situation is a safety issue. If those knots weren\u2019t tied correctly, there\u2019s a big chance of someone getting seriously hurt.", "Yeah, light YTA.\n\nYou're letting your jealousy and insecurity affect how you feel, and she has a legit point that if she's relying on you for safety, YOU need to get your head in the game so she doesn't get hurt.", "ESH. You're clearly jealous of her achievements in life despite her lack of effort, which is understandable, but something you should work on overcoming. Ideally, you should be *proud* of your partner for succeeding and doing well in life, and you're clearly not capable of that at this point in time. \n\nThat being said, she also shouldn't be getting frustrated at you for not being able to pick things up as quickly as her. Sh needs to understand that everyone has their own acclimatization level. \n\nRegarding this specific issue, I actually think you're mostly NTA. You could have done better in relaying your feelimgs (probably should have allowed yourself time to calm down and plan out what you wamted to say), but part of being in a relationship is communicating issues you have-with the mindset of working on them together. If you feel patronized, it's fair to express that, but again, better to have done so in a more constructive manner. \n\n>I told her most people aren't like her, I feel like she's been able to do anything she actually paid attention to, but for some of us it takes a little more time.\n\nThis is where I'm a little pessimistic about your judgement. Given the nature of the argument, I wonder if you worded this worse in the moment than you're relayimg, bc you clearly have hangups over this ability of hers. \n\n>I feel frustrated because I wasn't trying to screw around, and I feel like she always looks down on me or thinks I'm not trying\n\nHave you had a conversation with her about this before? If not, I suggest waiting until you both have calmed down and try to approach the topic again with a clearer plan of qhat you want to say to get your point across. Let her know that you don't appreciate her getting upset with you when you don't immediately succeed when you try something new, and that you want to learn it at *your* pace and not hers.", "YTA,for how you reacted to her and for your envy of her abilities and talents. But maybe take a smidgen of comfort in knowing she isn't great at everything.  She isn't a great teacher.", "This is your ego talking.\n\nLook at this way you\u2019re not mad at her ability to get things quickly you\u2019re upset at your inability to get things quickly.\n\nThis is about you and your insecurity about\nYour abilities. \n\nAlso she\u2019s not depending on you for safety you are depending on her and that\u2019s another thing your ego (and societal upbringing) is telling you is wrong. \n\nAlso a key point you keep bringing up she gets it when she PAYS ATTENTION. Sounds like you\u2019re so worried about her you\u2019re not focusing on the task at hand \n\n\nWork on that and stop comparing yourself and you might enjoy yourself in life more \n\nYTA", "YTA of course; correcting your mistake isn't \"looking down on you\", that's just all in your head", "YTA. If this guy's girlfriend is free on Thursday I got dibs on taking her out.", "YTA. I hope your girlfriend stops settling and finds someone that deserves her.", "NTA, but your title doesn't accurately convey the situation. You're not upset that she picks up on things faster, you're upset that she is actively rude and condescending to you. \n\nShe needs to learn to be more patient, and interact with you in a kinder way. Plus, as someone else mentioned, her taking it away from you and doing it for you keeps you from learning how to do it correctly, which is more dangerous in the long run. \n\n(Some Y T A for saying you think she has it easy; that part just made you sound jealous and resentful. We all have different struggles; if you love her, don't get bogged down in comparisons,  just be happy for her.)", "INFO: Was the instructor going to check the knots before the climb?", "I kinda agree with your girlfriend in this, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole. I don\u2019t really think anyone is an asshole here. She\u2019s right that you learn faster taking risks, and sometimes it\u2019s the only way you can learn something. You\u2019ve gotta risk falling down to get better. Also it *is* important that you learn to tie in correctly, that could very well be life or death in a real-life scenario. It\u2019s normal for you to be frustrated that you\u2019re not understanding something, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to take that out on your girlfriend just because she does understand it", "It\u2019s strange that you\u2019re frustrated over this. She\u2019s with *you*. You should be proud that you have a girlfriend who is motivated and quick to pick up on things. That\u2019s an awesome trait.\n\nI pick up on things quickly as well. It\u2019s because I\u2019m determined to do my best no matter what I\u2019m doing, and I throw myself into everything I do.\n\nBut what you *do* have a right to get frustrated about is that she talks down to you as if you\u2019re ignorant just because she picks up on something before you did which is not right. Everyone learns at their own pace. Some are quicker to pick up on things than others, and she shouldn\u2019t talk down to you like you\u2019re an idiot. Everyone learns at their own pace.\n\nHowever, you being frustrated because your girlfriend is more determined than you sounds like jealousy and makes you an unsupportive boyfriend.\n\nYTA.\n\nEdit: changed my vote because a kind Redditor helped me to think about this from a different perspective. Thanks!", "NAH. \n\nI relate a lot to your girlfriend in the sense that I\u2019m a natural learner. It\u2019s very easy for me to pick up new hobbies and skills quickly, and I often (unfairly) get frustrated when people don\u2019t understand something that seems so simple to me. It\u2019s fair for you to feel annoyed when she\u2019s constantly good at things that you struggle with. \n\nI think you should communicate more and ask more questions when you\u2019re struggling with something. There\u2019s no shame in it, especially when most ppl don\u2019t pick up as quickly as her. When you\u2019re in a higher stakes environment like rock climbing it\u2019s important to be transparent about what you\u2019re capable of and what you still need to learn. The lack of communication may be why she\u2019s frustrated, not your lack of understanding.", "NAH. Both sides are entirely fair. You don\u2019t learn the same as she does and that\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s entirely fair for her to be frustrated about you not being transparent about not getting the knots right when her safety is in your hands.\n\nEdit - Actually reading that rationale I gave I lean a bit towards YTA for disregarding her safety", "YTA. I rock climb and she\u2019s right; if you mess up you could seriously injure her. Do it as many times as it takes to get it right. Man, I hope you\u2019re using some auto locking belay device because I wouldn\u2019t trust you otherwise.", "NTA\n\nI not do these more technical activities with her.\n\"99% of the world isn't as gifted and lucky as you are.

If OP's girlfriend had shown him how to do it property, or let the instructor show him, then OP would have had the chance to learn; instead, OP didn't learn this key bit for the climbing lesson for both their safety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~INFO~~: Given this was a class, before you climbed did the instructor check your knots and ropes etc were all right? Just asking because if you were putting her at risk, AH territory because it is a safety issue, but if everything was being inspected by a qualified instructor before you touched a rock then her frustration wasn't entirely justified.\n\nBeyond that, I have to ask, if she is so good at stuff and gets things right first time, have you ever asked her to pick your lottery numbers?\n\nEdited for typos.", "ESH. She definitely should have had more patience with you since it was your guys' first lesson and she shouldn't have expected you to perfect. You getting frustrated about her being good at everything is valid, but not something that is necessarily a fault of hers. Be glad your girl is killing it! I feel like you saying she's living life \"on easy mode\" is discrediting her work.", "I had a long time friend. One time it suddenly occurred to me that this friend made me feel badly about myself.

It reads to me that you were getting frustrated with her before this incident as she can work less than you and achieve more. Maybe communicate this with her?", "YTA.

It seems like you were secretly hoping she would get fired, because she wasn't working the way you wanted her to, and were disappointed she was actually offered a promotion. You sound bitter that she gets her work done really fast and has the day off after only a few hours. \n\nI think you need to go to another rock climbing course on your own, because your resentment toward her blocks you from learning when she shows you how it's done. And she's correct, you HAVE TO learn the knots and every detail correctly, because rock climbing when your partner is half doing it is incredibly dangerous.", "YTA. Damn.

And you know what? I felt grateful for him. He also dropped out of high school, by the way. And then when he finally wanted his GED at 35 years old, he wrote it without studying *anything* and finished in the 98th percentile across the board.\n\nYou seem to have some self esteem and confidence issues.

I suffer from a learning disability that makes it hard for me to understand and interpret visual-spatial processing. The result is people getting very frustrated with me when I struggle to learn \u201cbasic\u201d sports stuff like OP describes, despite being obviously smart, My high school guidance counsellor even told me I was just lazy and trying to make excuses when I asked if a learning disability was why I was suddenly struggling in courses I never had had issues with before. People can\u2019t seem to realize that I have a very uneven cognitive profile, which makes me extremely exceptional in some areas while in the lowest 5th percentile for stuff like visual memory.\n\nETA: The above impacts me in many ways aside from sports. It took me years of driving lessons and many attempts to pass my driving test when most people I know got their license within a year.

The climber is still supposed to check that the belayer has tightened/locked the carabiner. It\u2019s annoying for me and my friends sometimes because we already know what we\u2019re doing and it seems repetitive, but it\u2019s an official safety recommendation.

That's not the thing of \"oh you can just take another class to make up for it.\"\n\nIts more of this type of activity isn't suited to OP, where you need to be actively able to make quick decisions to be able to keep your partner safe, as well as be able to be consistent in taking care of the safety equipment and not have a fit if your partner checks it and finds fault (partners are meant to check the equipment and knots of their partner as it directly impacts their own safety). This isn't the type of activity where a mistake is no biggie, you'll get it next time, as the mustake puts another person at risk. A Solo-climb class might be better suited to OP, not one where a human belayer is required.", "The main thing here that a lot of people miss is that this is the type of rock climbing where you work as a duo - one climber and one belayer (the person who stays on the ground and is tethered to the climber with the ropes and has the ability to stop the climber from falling if they happen to slip and such). And one thing that is common in this type of climbing is... checking each other's equipment/knots! Even the duos that have been together for years will still check each other's stuff incase the other one missed something by accident. \n\nA other thing that I picked up on in OPs post is how he shows this heavy resentment for what his gg has and how she quickly learns, but the only example we see of her giving him crap for not learning at a good pace was when it directly affected her safety. He doesn't mention another time where she chastised him for not being a quick learner, only the rock climbing incident.\n\nEdit: Reread the post and OP does mention she gets annoyed and frustrated at him during some of the other classes, but doesn't mention that she gave him crap for it. (He states she was annoyed during the rollerskating attempt, but with how op decribes what he was doing it sounds like my ice skating attempt - me near the edge of the rink with legs stiff af and not moving an inch due to being scared of falling - I could understand her annoyance)", "Reading the single comment he posted, the instructor was letting the pairs set up and then he would come check what they had done before allowing them to climb. \n\nThe thing with this type of climbing is:\n\nA. It is normal for the climber to check what the belayer had done, and vice versa. Expert climbers who have been partnered for years still check each other before each climb for their own safety, even if it's a slow and pain the the ass process, as the one time they decide not to check could very well be the time something wasn't done properly.\n\nB. OP wanted to half ass the knot and wait for the instructor to tell him he did it wrong, which isn't the best attitude to have in this case (if you struggle, call the teacher over). \n\nC. This isn't solo climbing, this is the type where a fuck up from you or your partner could mean serious injury or even death. His attitude of \"the instructor would have seen it\" isn't a good one, as if he is the belayer, he will have to pay attention to the climber to be able to stop a fall if it were to happen, and not being able to react quick enough will cause an injury.", "You may want to edit your original comment to reflect your judgement. The bit only reads parent comments.", "He commented on one of the info comments that the instructor was busy doing his rounds and still had to check them when GF noticed he did the tie off incorrectly.

This is essentially a form of abuse.  \n\nPeople are saying stuff like you should've spoken up if you didn't know how to tie the knot correctly. But a key part of not being good at something, is not being able to recognize whether or not something was done correctly. If you could tell if the knot was right or not, you could probably tie it correctly in the first place. Additionally, a learning environment with a coach or teacher is the exact place to make mistakes.    \n\nReceiving constant criticism and being made to feel incompetent also makes it harder to identify and take good advice as well. Since you are made to feel bad when your girlfriend sees your mistakes/lack of ability (which is the natural state!), you are more likely to hide your mistakes.

It's okay to be talked down to and belittled, just because she's smarter than him? NTA, op.", "I understand your girlfriend very well, because I'm very similar, though much older. Things come easily to me. When I was young someone would teach me a new game and I'd beat them at it first time. I'd usually grasp things the first time they were explained. But, like her, I had the emotional and social intelligence of a gnat.\n\nShe needs to recognize this shortcoming in herself and work on being kind and more patient. I wish I had a sure fire way to make this point to her, but not sure how (again, low social intelligence, sorry). If I were you, I would not stay with someone who is so condescending unless she makes an attempt at change. NTA.", "ESH. Her comment that \u201cyou need to pay more attention\u201d was pretty tone deaf. It assumes you weren\u2019t trying, where maybe you just needed more practice. Ditto for the roller skating thing, which made me kind of angry on your behalf. I also would be very nervous about falling. She has a different approach but yours is legitimate.\n\nLook, your gf is smarter than you, or at least better than you at practical skills. And maybe more fit. Or she\u2019s more tenacious, like she\u2019s used to trying and failing and then getting back on the fucking horse. I honestly kind of love her a little bit from your description.\n\nBut you are who you are. If you\u2019re doing your best, she needs to meet you where you are. If you don\u2019t understand how to belay and SHE KNOWS IT because she retied your knots, she should have refused to climb until you got it.\n\nI think you could both work together better as partners and treat these things as problems to be solved together. She can slow down and let you learn at your own pace. And you can speak up for yourself if you need a bit more time. Letting her climb when you KNEW you didn\u2019t know how to belay was a truly terrible choice.\n\nGetting frustrated is a completely normal reaction, but the question is how you handle it after.", "INFO: Why would it have been okay for the instructor to tell you you were wrong, but not her?", "YTA.

Additionally, just because she learns it quicker doesn't mean you'll never learn it or will always need help.\n\nThe more you reject her help - the more likely it'll be that you'll need help. \n\nShe doesn't need to correct you everytime though. For example, the roller skating was not an area that she should have said anything because it's just a fun little activity to do together...who cares how fast you're going lol.

Is that seriously the argument you came here to make?", "NTA . She should take into account how not everyone functions in the same way as her. Some of us require a different method of learning and have to do it in our own pace. We shouldn't be shamed for it. It reads more like you're asking for empathy from her, but she's focused on getting the job done or getting to the fun part herself but you're there to enjoy it together. \nMaybe avoid taking classes for the time being or atleast not something like rock climbing where you have to depend on each other.", "NTA for climbing class.\n\nI think it's reasonable to be frustrated in her situation on this specific occasion, because if her safety depends on it, she does NEED you to get it correctly. And if it's not correct, you do need to ask the teacher guy. Should she have been nicer about it? Absolutely, but I'd be pretty scared if I was doing rock climbing and the person holding me up was holding me up wrong.\n\nBUT if she acts like this in other scenarios, you need to run from her. Because it's not acceptable behaviour. Like, ok if it's during something high stress, if she was scared for her safety, etc. It's still not an ideal reaction, but at least understandable. But if she acts like that doing other things, she's very toxic.\n\nEdit: But you need to work on your jealousy towards her success. The fact she learns quickly is not a slight to you. It's not an attack, a competition or anything.", "Don\u2019t know why there are so many y t a. You acknowledge how smart GF is. Smart doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s ok to be rude and impatient. I\u2019d reconsider a relationship with someone who puts you down when you catch on slower than they do. That gets old fast. Your frustration is justified. She could choose to be encouraging and/or step back and take the pressure off of you instead of looking down on you. It makes me wonder how she would handle a child. NTA.", "Hard call. I'm going to say ESH. She needs to understand that things don't come easily to everyone and to stop condescending to you. But I think you need to work through your jealousy of her intelligence before you're too far into resentment. I don't think it's healthy to feel the need to compete intellectually with your partner.\n\nI have a mild developmental disability so I kind of fell off the curve after high school. I married someone who's much smarter than me and didn't have the same obstacles I did. Long story short, I was really jealous of his achievements and he didn't understand why things didn't come as easily to me.

That's not why I think she's also at fault. \n\nMy point is that most partners would provide a basic level of support for eachother.

I was watching a youtube trying to learn them(can't learn from printed directions) and failed Miserably.  Over and Over...", "NTA", "Some just have mad comprehensive skills\u2026way above the average person. But she seems to be a bit impatient with you for not getting it as fast as she does. \n\nIt may be frustrating for you, but she appears to have frustrations with you as well. You two just need to talk it out.", "Are you the AH for all of your question marks?  Like maybe you are?  Who writes like that?", "I suggest asking her to coach you on the knots, at home where you can practice without making her feel unsafe. Knots can be difficult for some people.\nFocus on the look and feel of a correctly chosen and tied knot.  Practice feeding the rope through your fingers while belaying. Give her just enough rope to move in any direction. Pulling her off is bad form.\nAs a bigger guy you are not likely the best climber, but as a bombproof belay you have potential. If she belays you then there is a good chance she will leave the ground unless she is not massively lighter than you and has superb technique.\n\nThe trick is to not compete with her, but rather explore other activities where you can shine. Tramping could be a good option.  You can likely carry twice as much, and she will appreciate your effort the first time she tries picking up your pack. Many outdoors climbing venues have a good long hike, so as long as you make her adventures easy, fun and safe you will be golden.\nNever, let go of the rope with your live hand -the rope tail- until she is safely on the ground.  \nNote I once taught my my to belay me in an afternoon of me jumping out of the top of pine trees. All I did was make sure she was correctly set up, and never let go of the rope. She wasn\u2019t climbing, but she made a very good belayer. In contrast a world class climber broke her back because she failed to check her harness, and another their collar bone because they filed to check his partners harness. Climbing is mutual care for each other, and trust is hard earned.  Your girlfriend was most likely expressing her own insecurity, combined with overconfidence and bravado. My best non climbing friend once dropped me 17m. He mastered the knots, but because bored and distracted and pulled me of the rock. His expresi\u00f3n as i plummeted past him was golden, because he was hoisted 5m off the ground. He then let go of the rope. And hurt himself. \nSo the answer is simple, pay close attention to your girlfriends form as she climbs, and give her 1.5m of slack at all times, and shorten the rope immediately as she falls. To level up; imagine how you would complete the same moves. Complement and encourage her to keep moving. \n\nChances are if we went climbing together I would trust your hands before hers, even despite your lack of confidence because I have the experience to know, and check both our gear and your attitude. \n\nExplain how you felt over over a meal, and have another go.  And always do your best to prepare ahead of time for her next big thing to do. If you both end up doing something your expert in, just do it without expressing anything more than confidence, and joy. At the very least watch a YouTube video and play it back in your head dozens of times while imaging the feeling of doing the action. \n\nIn WWII a American prisoner of war in a Japanese camp taught himself golf by playing in his head. Shortly after the war he became a world class golf champion. Prior to the war he had seen a golf tournament, but never played. The key is practice in your mind, if not physically. Repetition is key, even if only in the mind.  If you watch other climbers you will see, them watching other climbers intently. Though they are standing looking up at the rock they are climbing hard in their minds, practicing every move, feeling the rock, the muscle strain, and the balance.  By the time they are showing their skills to their girl and boy friends they have no fear of falling or failure and often make the climb look effortless. But any good climber will double check by eye and hand both their gear, and that of their climbing partner. It\u2019s one way of assuring your partner that you know what your doing. \nClimbing instructors come in all types, some are very effective, others play to the clients fear. To learn knots stand beside, not in front of your instructor so the knot is right way up. At the beginner level only three knots are useful a figure-8, a thumb knot (locking knot) and a clove hitch.  Climbers practice until they can tie one handed, in the dark, and able to identify a correctly tied knot by touch. And they learn to tie both he easy way, and the hard way.  All you need to know is a figure 8 knot should lie completely flat in the hand, and be symmetrical with the load on the outside strand. If the instructor is teaching you to use bowlines, he is an alpine climber or a boating fanatic. A bowline is useful, but not so much in a gym context.", "YASOTA.

I'm not going to berate this man, i'm not going to try and fix it.

And thirdly, *again*, she was right: if you're going to tie a knot when belaying for someone, you need to do it right, because otherwise someone is going to get hurt.

If you read praise into that, that's on you, but personally I would re-evaluate your standards for praise. Praise usually isn't so heavily layered with open jealousy and incredulity.

Maybe she\u2019ll recognize that her approach isn\u2019t helpful.  But if she doesn\u2019t, it\u2019s a sign of a lack of empathy that you shouldn\u2019t ignore.", "NTA - The things your girlfriend is saying to you are both unhelpful for your learning process and downright mean. If she doesn\u2019t trust you as a good climbing partner and you can\u2019t learn with her constant criticism of you, then honestly don\u2019t do that activity together. \n\nI won\u2019t go so far as to call it abusive, but you absolutely should not put up with it and a serious discussion is in order for you two.", "I personally think, NTA. There are things that I'm good at that and pick up quick that my husband doesn't, and vice versa (even though it sounds like you are constantly struggling, she's not). I get really frustrated when my husband corrects me on stuff in a way like this, as he does me. If you know you have a hard time picking up stuff like this, perhaps take a class or two before going together to get the 1-on-1 you need to pick up without the frustrations of of her over-correcting. I understand she was trying to help, but it also sounds like she was just trying to correct the knot instead of helping you understand how you were doing the knots wrong. I think she went about helping in the wrong way. Everyone learns in a different way (some hands on, some visual, etc) and at a different pace. You two learn both differently. It also sounds like it may become a problem in the relationship, if it already hasn't. I don't know if you're just upset from the situation and just hurt she picks up quick and goes quick, but you seem to not like how she goes about things. You don't like how she half-assed school and still flew through, how she gets things DONE quickly at work (yet believe she's not doing all she should and that she's setting herself up for failures and will be fired), amongst other things. Maybe you need someone more at your pace...", "NTA. Losing faith in this sub the day. If you read this and thought this dude was the AH please don't give advice on this sub.", "Is she ADD? This sounds exactly like my brother. Super ADD, never did homework but passed every test in high school, when he found something he actually liked in college he got straight A\u2019s. Everything he actually liked and focused on he mastered. He was just naturally incredibly smart as long as it held his attention.", "NTA OP.  I think your frustration comes from your GF constantly belittling you because you can't learn or catch on as quick as she can.  All the YTA commenters will downvote me and reason that your GF's life could potentially be in danger (which could be true) but they are deliberately choosing to ignore how your GF **CONSTANTLY** **BELITTLES** you over just about everything you try and she succeeds.  Exercise classes, she aces, you don't, she belittles.  Skating, she aces, you don't, she belittles.  Now with this climbing class, she aces, you don't, she belittles.  \n\nSorry OP but you are a man, so this automatically makes you a AH in here.  If this was a woman typing that her man was great at everything he does but you as a woman, gets frustrated because he is so good at everything that he puts her down when she can't catch on or learn as quick as he does, there would be \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9's all over the place.\n\nInstead of her realizing that you learn at a different pace and **PATIENTLY** try to let you learn at your own pace, is putting you down on **EVERY** endeavor the two of you try together.  Why do you continue to put up with this?  Not only is this controlling but it's mental abuse.  If you were a woman, commenters would be telling you to run and not walk away from this relationship.  The majority of the human race have to practice, practice, practice before they can become sufficient in a skill.  Some catch on quicker and some it takes a bit of time.  You need to focus on what you are very good at doing and stop comparing yourself to your GF (this is what is frustrating you).  If you intend to stay with your GF, then don't participate in activities that are competitive where she won't have any excuses to belittle you.  Also may I state that NO kitty cat is worth the price of abuse.", "NTA - wow these comments. There are two issues here: 1) you generally do seem to have some level of resentment for her talents. That isn\u2019t good, and is something you need to deal with. 2) She did not hear your concern, and treated you with condescension when it came to rock climbing stuff. I climb, I get it. We need to be sure. We do always have someone else check our knots; we absolutely do not interject with an exasperated tone and berate each other. \n\nIf the teacher said: come on ive shown you five times already what the fuck, we would all agree that this is unacceptable. Why is it ok for his loved one to treat him like shit? People are faulting you for the first issue without recognizing that she did in fact treat you poorly in that context and was entirely unreceptive to your communication afterwards.", "You seem angry not because she\u2019s smart but because she makes you feel dumb by talking down to you. NTA.", "NAH.\n\nI feel like what you actually have is not a problem with her being a jack of all trades, and more with how she speaks to you when you fall short.\n\nBut you won't be able to communicate that to her (which is a totally valid conflict) if you keep getting hung up on your jealousy surrounding her skillset and ability to easily master things.\n\nSort your feelings out and face your frustrations head on.", "NTA. She seems like a jerk, she\u2019s a bit of a bully. Some people take longer to pick up things and that\u2019s okay", "Some people are missing the key complaint in this post, and that is that the GF is being condescending and impatient with how long it takes OP to understand a concept or perform a skill. Of course that would make OP (or anybody for that matter) feel bad and maybe a little insecure if all she does is get frustrated with him that he doesn\u2019t get it as quick as her. Does she have amazing qualities and has probably figured out the system? Sure. Is it possible that OP is being too sensitive and probably insecure about his abilities vs hers? Sure. Bottom line though, the GF should be more patient with his learning style and be a more supportive partner and he should try to emulate her a little more if he actually does recognize that she is doing something right. \nSo I would say NTA", "NTA. She\u2019s condescending and rude, y\u2019all need to communicate.", "I had an ex who would treat me this way. Very condescending & irritated by my learning style. It severely impacted my self esteem & self worth for a long while. I\u2019m **not** a man & I feel that a lot of the Y T A comments here are sexist .. I really feel if the genders were reversed it would be a resounding NTA.", "NTA. OP communicated maturely how he is feeling about this, its okay to not approach things the sane way and the GF seems to not be accepting or understanding that she copes with things very differently. She is being pushy because she is not taking the time to understand that you learn at a different pace.\n\nI would say it's natural to feel some jealousy when someone grasps things so quickly and it doesn't seek like OP is being nasty about this, there's no indication of not supporting her just context that she is a high achiever! If she wants to be in this relationship she needs to take the time to understand how OP learns.\n\nAlso this climbing is in a setting where the instructor will be there to ensure safety- she seems fine to just go for things like the rollerblading, she is just being unnecessarily rude here, undermining you by not allowing you to get instruction from the coach, who knows better than she does. While she might have some level of anxiety surrounding it she needs to take OPs feelings into account too and stop putting him down as this is discouraging and likely to make things even harder to grasp.", "All these comments absolutely reeks of toxic feminism, and before anyone goes off at me, I'm a woman. People see a woman doing well, and a man struggling with the same tasks. Instead of realizing how condescending she's being it immediately falls back onto OP for being insecure. \n\nIt seems like they only took one or two classes so these mistakes are justified, especially with knots. For some people it is difficult to wrap your head around it, and that is okay, everyone learns at different rates. \n\nIt seems like OP communicated his feelings in a respectful way, no matter what circumstance you're under it isn't fun being belittled and someone shouldn't be put into AH territory for simply communicating their feelings. \n\nIf the genders were swapped these comments would be very different, and it's honestly so sad to see that men are still being ridiculed for simply sharing their feelings. OP is NTA, even if he is feeling insecure which so many of these comments are saying, he still has every right to communicate it.", "NTA because you don\u2019t seem to be upset that your gf is good at everything, but how she treats you when you\u2019re learning. It\u2019s important to be able to learn and grow with support in a relationship, and it appears you\u2019ve been trying a lot of things with her and haven\u2019t gotten the feelings of togetherness and learning that you\u2019d like. You Y W B T A if you were just upset that she was good at everything and you weren\u2019t, but there\u2019s more more there, especially with how you have tried to vocalize your needs and she hasn\u2019t really appeared to listen and chastises you for it when you are trying. \n\nMy husband picks things up very quickly, way quicker than anyone else I\u2019ve really known. It is hard to adjust sometimes when something you love and worked hard at is mastered quickly by another, and it\u2019s something I worked on when it came to reframing my perspective. But my husband never expected me to learn anything in five tries or less, and in fact, realized with his own socioemotional work that expecting perfection without patience or practice is really hurtful and unproductive to everyone involved.", "Might get downvoted but NTA\u2026 \n\nI would be frustrated too if I was getting  berated by someone I love on a day-to-day basis. And you went to a class to LEARN, not to rock climb from the get go. Learning certain skills usually takes time and practise so it sounds your gf just lacks some empathy and patience. \n\nWhere you might be the AH though is that you sound kind of jealous of your gf instead of being proud of her (e.g. the part where you talk about engineering school or getting promoted). \n\nYou both need to work on this relationship if it is to last. Your gf needs to learn some compassion and understand that to most people taking up a new skill takes time. And you should do something about your frustration that she\u2019s instantly good at things because that is not gonna change and if you let this feeling build up, you\u2019ll start resenting her. Not a good trait for long-term relationships", "NTA. It\u2019s one thing if she\u2019s just really good at everything. It\u2019s a completely different story when she starts mistreating and belittling you because you aren\u2019t picking things up as quickly. Her lack of patience with you sucks and is a red flag. If I was struggling with something my partner was good at and they made me feel like shit because I wasn\u2019t as good or picking it up as quickly, I would loose interest in the activity and, over time, them.", "I think A LOT of you all are missing the entire point of this post. He\u2019s not upset she\u2019s smart or picks things up fast, he\u2019s upset because of the way she treats him when he doesn\u2019t. He communicated how she\u2019s making him feel and she doubled down with her behavior towards him and why she feels justified treating him this way. It\u2019s not ok to be rude and degrade your partner just because they aren\u2019t as as smart as you or pick things up as fast. NTA OP you are understandably frustrated with her treatment of you and she should have listened when you told her how you felt. You were in a class! That\u2019s what a class is for, to learn. If everyone was supposed to know it and be an expert already it wouldn\u2019t have been necessary for the instructor to check the knots but since he was I\u2019m going to assume it isn\u2019t unreasonable to assume you weren\u2019t the only one who didn\u2019t have it down yet.", "NTA. She's smart. That's great. She's also rude and condescending. Not great.", "NTA if it is because of the tone that she used with you.

Gf is belittling you when you don't get things as quickly as she does. That's BS and you shouldn't have to put up with that mess. Tell her to either talk to you like she has some got damn sense or shut up. Or lay it all out like you did here and make sure she understands that the way she talks to you is unacceptable and you'll be ignoring her from now on.

Your girlfriend is a dick. Smart and talented. And a dick.", "NTA i dont fets all the y.t.a. it is obvious that the problem isn't that she is smart but the way she talks to you.

Heck yeah she's amazing! \n\nBut she also needs to learn how to treat other people better.", "I feel kind of bad for OP, not because their GF is good at thing, not her fault, but because it seems like they is letting their insecurities decide how they treat the people in thier life. It is clear that OP is frustrated with themself that it them longer to learn things and most likely ignores anything that they are actually good at. Seeing their GF like an obstacles however is no way to react.\n\nBeing frustrated with yourself doesn't mean you get to take it out on other people. Especially someone that you love who has done nothing to you. YTA but you should take this time to reflect on what the real issue is. Is it really because your GF is good at things or is it because you were more like her? And don't forget that your GF is a real person too! She has her own insecurities just like everyone else and is not the perfect person you're imaging in your head.", "Honestly I think NTA.\n\nI've had ex's and friends do this to me and it was so infuriating. You shouldn't be angry because she gets things easily esp with work it is incredibly infuriating but it does happen. My friend is like that he flits thru life not putting in effort and still makes it on top. He literally got a promotion to second to the boss only after a week and a half being there. \n\nHer putting you down does make her one tho. Alot of people who do this tend to get annoyed with everyone else for not going their speed all the time. She needs to learn that not everyone is like her.
