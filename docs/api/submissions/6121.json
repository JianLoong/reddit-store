And she did fine and got high honors every year? \n\nLike i genuinely don't know how she does it but she doesn't pay attention or try at a lot but when she actually does pay attention to something she masters it pretty fast. \n\nLike I swear she lives on easy mode, she works like 1 or 2 hours a day at her job, makes a full-time salary, and says she gets everything her bosses ask for done in that little time so why work more? She's been doing this for like 6 years across different jobs and for a while I thought she might be getting close to getting fired, but no she got offered a promotion? \n\nAnd this year we've wanted to get more fit together and it's a little frustrating because whenever we sign up for a class together, or try something new together, she is like instantly good at it and gets frustrated I'm not. \n\nLike we went roller skating and she just threw herself into it, wiped out like 10 times, then got it down. I was trying to be a little more careful because I'm a bigger guy and couldn't take all those falls, and she started to get annoyed saying I wasn't ever gonna learn if I didn't take some risks \n\nThis week, we started rock climbing and were taking a class on belaying, and each time the instructor showed us a new knot, she just did it instantly right along with the coach. \n\nAnd when we were setting up to climb, she kept on being like \"no not like that\" when I was tying in and when I got frustrated she'd just reach over and redo my knots she got mad and told me that if I was holding her 40 feet up I better start paying attention. I felt frustrated and hurt because I was doing my best, I would have just preferred if she let the coach correct me\n\nI got home after climbing and told her that I was getting frustrated that just because stuff comes easy to her and she gets it instantly doesn't mean she can talk down to me. She got frustrated and said that's fine if we're talking about painting or some shit, but when she's depending on me for her safety, I can't screw it up, I need to pay attention. \n\nI told her most people aren't like her, I feel like she's been able to do anything she actually paid attention to, but for some of us it takes a little more time. She was like \"He literally showed you how to tie off 5 times, like if you can't get it by then, maybe you should of told me instead of just screwing around\n\nI feel frustrated because I wasn't trying to screw around, and I feel like she always looks down on me or thinks I'm not trying \n\nAITA for how I acted at the climbing class and for my frustrations with my girlfriend?", "created_utc": 1672509329, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zzzo2z/aita_for_getting_frustrated_with_my_girlfriend/", "score": 357, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You're jealous of your girlfriend, and you're being an asshole about her ability to learn quickly.", "YTA - so you have landed a smart amazing woman who works hard and succeeds and you have the nerve to be angry and jealous about it instead of just being grateful you get to be a part of her life.", "YTA sorry.   Climbing is serious stuff - do it wrong and someone gets hurt (or worse).  So your girlfriend attempting to correct you is perfectly okay in this environment.   Your post sounds like you are just jealous of her abilities.   You should be proud and supportive of her amazing skills.", "YTA. She just is smarter than you. Suck it up and be grateful that she still wants to be with you. As for the rock climbing debacle: Would you rather have you both kill yourselves than take directions from your girlfriend? That is extreme!", "Yta \n\nYou wanted to climb with an incorrect knot? Or did you want her to climb with an incorrect knot?  That could have killed or seriously injured one of you. And you got mad because she doesn't want someone to get injured?", "YTA. It\u2019s okay to be frustrated because stuff comes easier to her but you should be happy for your SO and you sound envious. It doesn\u2019t sound like she rubs it in and she only called you out when it was regarding her safety. Regarding everything else, she shouldn\u2019t have to be less or herself to make you feel better. Maybe look into a therapist to help change your view of the situation and know that we\u2019re all different and that\u2019s okay.", "YTA, sounds like you are jealous of your girlfriend for being so smart and picking things up easily, and then to cry about her making sure the knot is ok, would you have preferred for both of you to be injured to prove a point?", "Gentle YTA. Who do you want to be partnered up with in life?  Someone who is intelligent and competent?  Or someone who can\u2019t get out of their own way?  Life is much tougher with the second option. \n\nYour response is one of jealousy. You should be proud of her.", "YTA. \n\nThat's a whole lot of resentment and jealousy you have there. Sounds like some time for some personal improvement and individual therapy. \n\nUltimately, she's right - she's depending on you for her safety and if you don't know what you're doing then you need to speak up and ask for help.", "YTA. Stop being jealous of her and be proud. Not everyone learns the same way and at the same rate. There\u2019s a conversation you two can have but it\u2019s not her fault she learns fast.", "YTA. Sounds like you feel threatened by her being better at learning.", "Soft YTA mostly for the whole insecurity towards your girlfriend\u2019s natural ability to pick up new things. Is not something to be frustrated about, you should be proud of dating someone with a full brain in this day and age . \n\nAlso sounds like you\u2019re trying to be that couple that does everything together which is really cool on social media but doesn\u2019t work for everybody in real life. Maybe you need to do your own thing , get good at something at your own pace n build up your confidence so you can stop comparing yourself to her. You don\u2019t need to be super involved all the time, just being there and show support is enough sometimes", "Honestly just break up with her and let her find someone who appreciates her instead of resents her. YTA", "Kinda E S H, but more YTA. You should have been honest that you couldn't remember how to tie in, and called the instructor over instead of faking it because you're jealous of your gf's competency.", "Very gentle YTA. I understand exactly how you feel. Some people just don\u2019t even seem real, they\u2019re so stupidly blessed at everything, and it\u2019s hard not to resent that. I relate to that, too. I have a friend who makes me feel inferior like this. Im sorry you\u2019re feeling this way.", "ESH\n\nI feel like most of the y t a s are overlooking the fact that the girlfriend is upset with him for not picking things up as fast as her. He clarified in a comment that his mistake with the knots would have been corrected by the instructor before they ever climbed. It wouldn't have put her in danger. Even so, insulting your partner and immediately criticizing their efforts isn't the way to communicate if she's nervous about it. She could have politely said \"hey OP, I think this knot is tied a little incorrectly. Could I show you how I did mine or did you want to ask the instructor to review it again?\" I don't think she needs to pander to his insecurities or jealousy, but I also don't think she's showing him much respect or compassion. \n\nIt sounds to me like you're both frustrated with the other for not understanding each other's learning ability. She's naturally gifted and it sounds like she has a lot of practical intelligence. You take more time to pick things up and it sounds like new skills don't come as intuitively to you. I think you do sound jealous of your girlfriend, but she's also inconsiderate of the fact that you take more time to learn things. \n\nShe shouldn't belittle you and you shouldn't resent her. You need to have an open conversation about how you feel. Don't attack her for her success, but explain how her disparaging remarks make you feel. \n\nMaybe you can also reach out to her for help more in the future. Rather than being upset that she's progressing faster, ask her if she could explain something or request a little support until you catch up. You need to get over your insecurities and she needs to understand that not everyone has the same level of ability. Now if she's still belittling you for not being as quick/talented as her, then it's not on you. Have a conversation and see where it goes.", "NAH sounds like the climbing trip brought this issue to a head, and it's a tough one! It's hard on both sides, I am sure. She has probably noticed that it takes you a little longer to get things, and worries that in a crisis that requires quick-thinking she won't be able to rely on you. You probably worry that you'll feel left behind, and that your own good qualities are overshadowed.\n\n\nYet if she's with you, there must be something she values in you. What are your good qualities that you bring? For me my husband's steadiness, kindness, and good humor are my rock. Achievements come easily to me, much like your GF, but it would all be pretty hollow without love.\n\nAlso,  a lot of us quick thinkers have brains that work like \"catch and release \" fishing. I learn quick,  then let it go. But my husband jokes his brain is like Fort Knox. Its hard to get new stuff in there, but once learned its locked in forever. So as we age I find myself turning to him more and more for his repository of knowledge, just as he relys on me to grasp and interpret new things.\n\n\nI hope you too find a balance that works for you!", "Gentle YTA. It\u2019s okay to get frustrated if your girlfriend catches onto things quicker than you. That\u2019s just who she. You need to either accept this or cut her loose of you can\u2019t because it\u2019s going to breed even more resentment. Ask yourself, would you rather she dumb herself down to spare your feelings? \n\nThe rock climbing situation is a safety issue. If those knots weren\u2019t tied correctly, there\u2019s a big chance of someone getting seriously hurt.", "Yeah, light YTA.\n\nYou're letting your jealousy and insecurity affect how you feel, and she has a legit point that if she's relying on you for safety, YOU need to get your head in the game so she doesn't get hurt.", "ESH. You're clearly jealous of her achievements in life despite her lack of effort, which is understandable, but something you should work on overcoming. Ideally, you should be *proud* of your partner for succeeding and doing well in life, and you're clearly not capable of that at this point in time. \n\nThat being said, she also shouldn't be getting frustrated at you for not being able to pick things up as quickly as her. Sh needs to understand that everyone has their own acclimatization level. \n\nRegarding this specific issue, I actually think you're mostly NTA. You could have done better in relaying your feelimgs (probably should have allowed yourself time to calm down and plan out what you wamted to say), but part of being in a relationship is communicating issues you have-with the mindset of working on them together. If you feel patronized, it's fair to express that, but again, better to have done so in a more constructive manner. \n\n>I told her most people aren't like her, I feel like she's been able to do anything she actually paid attention to, but for some of us it takes a little more time.\n\nThis is where I'm a little pessimistic about your judgement. Given the nature of the argument, I wonder if you worded this worse in the moment than you're relayimg, bc you clearly have hangups over this ability of hers. \n\n>I feel frustrated because I wasn't trying to screw around, and I feel like she always looks down on me or thinks I'm not trying\n\nHave you had a conversation with her about this before? If not, I suggest waiting until you both have calmed down and try to approach the topic again with a clearer plan of qhat you want to say to get your point across. Let her know that you don't appreciate her getting upset with you when you don't immediately succeed when you try something new, and that you want to learn it at *your* pace and not hers.", "YTA,for how you reacted to her and for your envy of her abilities and talents. But maybe take a smidgen of comfort in knowing she isn't great at everything.  She isn't a great teacher.", "This is your ego talking.\n\nLook at this way you\u2019re not mad at her ability to get things quickly you\u2019re upset at your inability to get things quickly.\n\nThis is about you and your insecurity about\nYour abilities. \n\nAlso she\u2019s not depending on you for safety you are depending on her and that\u2019s another thing your ego (and societal upbringing) is telling you is wrong. \n\nAlso a key point you keep bringing up she gets it when she PAYS ATTENTION. Sounds like you\u2019re so worried about her you\u2019re not focusing on the task at hand \n\n\nWork on that and stop comparing yourself and you might enjoy yourself in life more \n\nYTA", "YTA of course; correcting your mistake isn't \"looking down on you\", that's just all in your head", "YTA. If this guy's girlfriend is free on Thursday I got dibs on taking her out.", "YTA. I hope your girlfriend stops settling and finds someone that deserves her.", "NTA, but your title doesn't accurately convey the situation. You're not upset that she picks up on things faster, you're upset that she is actively rude and condescending to you. \n\nShe needs to learn to be more patient, and interact with you in a kinder way. Plus, as someone else mentioned, her taking it away from you and doing it for you keeps you from learning how to do it correctly, which is more dangerous in the long run. \n\n(Some Y T A for saying you think she has it easy; that part just made you sound jealous and resentful. We all have different struggles; if you love her, don't get bogged down in comparisons,  just be happy for her.)", "INFO: Was the instructor going to check the knots before the climb?", "I kinda agree with your girlfriend in this, but I don\u2019t think you\u2019re an asshole. I don\u2019t really think anyone is an asshole here. She\u2019s right that you learn faster taking risks, and sometimes it\u2019s the only way you can learn something. You\u2019ve gotta risk falling down to get better. Also it *is* important that you learn to tie in correctly, that could very well be life or death in a real-life scenario. It\u2019s normal for you to be frustrated that you\u2019re not understanding something, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to take that out on your girlfriend just because she does understand it", "It\u2019s strange that you\u2019re frustrated over this. She\u2019s with *you*. You should be proud that you have a girlfriend who is motivated and quick to pick up on things. That\u2019s an awesome trait.\n\nI pick up on things quickly as well. It\u2019s because I\u2019m determined to do my best no matter what I\u2019m doing, and I throw myself into everything I do.\n\nBut what you *do* have a right to get frustrated about is that she talks down to you as if you\u2019re ignorant just because she picks up on something before you did which is not right. Everyone learns at their own pace. Some are quicker to pick up on things than others, and she shouldn\u2019t talk down to you like you\u2019re an idiot. Everyone learns at their own pace.\n\nHowever, you being frustrated because your girlfriend is more determined than you sounds like jealousy and makes you an unsupportive boyfriend.\n\nYTA.\n\nEdit: changed my vote because a kind Redditor helped me to think about this from a different perspective. Thanks!", "NAH. \n\nI relate a lot to your girlfriend in the sense that I\u2019m a natural learner. It\u2019s very easy for me to pick up new hobbies and skills quickly, and I often (unfairly) get frustrated when people don\u2019t understand something that seems so simple to me. It\u2019s fair for you to feel annoyed when she\u2019s constantly good at things that you struggle with. \n\nI think you should communicate more and ask more questions when you\u2019re struggling with something. There\u2019s no shame in it, especially when most ppl don\u2019t pick up as quickly as her. When you\u2019re in a higher stakes environment like rock climbing it\u2019s important to be transparent about what you\u2019re capable of and what you still need to learn. The lack of communication may be why she\u2019s frustrated, not your lack of understanding.", "NAH. Both sides are entirely fair. You don\u2019t learn the same as she does and that\u2019s okay, but it\u2019s entirely fair for her to be frustrated about you not being transparent about not getting the knots right when her safety is in your hands.\n\nEdit - Actually reading that rationale I gave I lean a bit towards YTA for disregarding her safety", "YTA. I rock climb and she\u2019s right; if you mess up you could seriously injure her. Do it as many times as it takes to get it right. Man, I hope you\u2019re using some auto locking belay device because I wouldn\u2019t trust you otherwise.", "NTA\n\nI not do these more technical activities with her.\n\"99% of the world isn't as gifted and lucky as you are. When you treat me like I'm not trying it makes me feel badly. You need to stop. From now on I will not take classes where you think I'll put you in danger. I will not take classes or do activities where you aren't patient or supportive\"", "Like, YTA. Like, get over yourself. Like, so fucking what she\u2019s better at things than you.

You have no clue what you're talking about and this is a human being, not a fucking character in a book or some shit.\n\nHoney, you need therapy. Alright, this is a self-esteem issue. Something millions of people struggle with while having no clue of the underlying issue. You come off as jealous because you're putting yourself down in your mind. Don't listen to these idiots just saying you're an asshole for being jealous. Jealousy comes from your own lack of self-esteem. Even when you don't consciously think negatively of yourself, your brain is still absorbing the negative comments you're getting and reinforcing that negativity in your mind. Which is why this community is a suck-hole of bullshit that no one should pay attention to. Turn this shit off and make an appointment. Sit down with your girlfriend and explain your feelings and that you plan to get help to work on it. \n\nA decent PERSON will understand. It's a you problem, yes, just not what you think it is. And it's something that takes a long time to work through, but you can absolutely do it. Find a good therapist who can help you navigate you through it.", "ETA: NTA\n\nETA2: Just thought I would clarify the reason for the NTA. OP says that when he got it wrong, his girlfriend took over and re-did the knots for him. If OP's girlfriend had shown him how to do it property, or let the instructor show him, then OP would have had the chance to learn; instead, OP didn't learn this key bit for the climbing lesson for both their safety.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~INFO~~: Given this was a class, before you climbed did the instructor check your knots and ropes etc were all right? Just asking because if you were putting her at risk, AH territory because it is a safety issue, but if everything was being inspected by a qualified instructor before you touched a rock then her frustration wasn't entirely justified.\n\nBeyond that, I have to ask, if she is so good at stuff and gets things right first time, have you ever asked her to pick your lottery numbers?\n\nEdited for typos.", "ESH. She definitely should have had more patience with you since it was your guys' first lesson and she shouldn't have expected you to perfect. You getting frustrated about her being good at everything is valid, but not something that is necessarily a fault of hers. Be glad your girl is killing it! I feel like you saying she's living life \"on easy mode\" is discrediting her work.", "I had a long time friend. One time it suddenly occurred to me that this friend made me feel badly about myself.

You sound bitter that she gets her work done really fast and has the day off after only a few hours. \n\nI think you need to go to another rock climbing course on your own, because your resentment toward her blocks you from learning when she shows you how it's done.

It\u2019s annoying for me and my friends sometimes because we already know what we\u2019re doing and it seems repetitive, but it\u2019s an official safety recommendation.

That's not the thing of \"oh you can just take another class to make up for it.\"\n\nIts more of this type of activity isn't suited to OP, where you need to be actively able to make quick decisions to be able to keep your partner safe, as well as be able to be consistent in taking care of the safety equipment and not have a fit if your partner checks it and finds fault (partners are meant to check the equipment and knots of their partner as it directly impacts their own safety). This isn't the type of activity where a mistake is no biggie, you'll get it next time, as the mustake puts another person at risk. A Solo-climb class might be better suited to OP, not one where a human belayer is required.", "The main thing here that a lot of people miss is that this is the type of rock climbing where you work as a duo - one climber and one belayer (the person who stays on the ground and is tethered to the climber with the ropes and has the ability to stop the climber from falling if they happen to slip and such). And one thing that is common in this type of climbing is... checking each other's equipment/knots! Even the duos that have been together for years will still check each other's stuff incase the other one missed something by accident. \n\nA other thing that I picked up on in OPs post is how he shows this heavy resentment for what his gg has and how she quickly learns, but the only example we see of her giving him crap for not learning at a good pace was when it directly affected her safety. He doesn't mention another time where she chastised him for not being a quick learner, only the rock climbing incident.\n\nEdit: Reread the post and OP does mention she gets annoyed and frustrated at him during some of the other classes, but doesn't mention that she gave him crap for it. (He states she was annoyed during the rollerskating attempt, but with how op decribes what he was doing it sounds like my ice skating attempt - me near the edge of the rink with legs stiff af and not moving an inch due to being scared of falling - I could understand her annoyance)", "Reading the single comment he posted, the instructor was letting the pairs set up and then he would come check what they had done before allowing them to climb. \n\nThe thing with this type of climbing is:\n\nA. It is normal for the climber to check what the belayer had done, and vice versa. Expert climbers who have been partnered for years still check each other before each climb for their own safety, even if it's a slow and pain the the ass process, as the one time they decide not to check could very well be the time something wasn't done properly.\n\nB. OP wanted to half ass the knot and wait for the instructor to tell him he did it wrong, which isn't the best attitude to have in this case (if you struggle, call the teacher over). \n\nC. This isn't solo climbing, this is the type where a fuck up from you or your partner could mean serious injury or even death. His attitude of \"the instructor would have seen it\" isn't a good one, as if he is the belayer, he will have to pay attention to the climber to be able to stop a fall if it were to happen, and not being able to react quick enough will cause an injury.", "You may want to edit your original comment to reflect your judgement. The bit only reads parent comments.", "He commented on one of the info comments that the instructor was busy doing his rounds and still had to check them when GF noticed he did the tie off incorrectly.

This is essentially a form of abuse.  \n\nPeople are saying stuff like you should've spoken up if you didn't know how to tie the knot correctly. But a key part of not being good at something, is not being able to recognize whether or not something was done correctly. If you could tell if the knot was right or not, you could probably tie it correctly in the first place. Additionally, a learning environment with a coach or teacher is the exact place to make mistakes.    \n\nReceiving constant criticism and being made to feel incompetent also makes it harder to identify and take good advice as well. Since you are made to feel bad when your girlfriend sees your mistakes/lack of ability (which is the natural state!), you are more likely to hide your mistakes.

Things come easily to me. When I was young someone would teach me a new game and I'd beat them at it first time. I'd usually grasp things the first time they were explained. But, like her, I had the emotional and social intelligence of a gnat.\n\nShe needs to recognize this shortcoming in herself and work on being kind and more patient.

If I were you, I would not stay with someone who is so condescending unless she makes an attempt at change. NTA.", "ESH. Her comment that \u201cyou need to pay more attention\u201d was pretty tone deaf. It assumes you weren\u2019t trying, where maybe you just needed more practice.

She has a different approach but yours is legitimate.\n\nLook, your gf is smarter than you, or at least better than you at practical skills. And maybe more fit. Or she\u2019s more tenacious, like she\u2019s used to trying and failing and then getting back on the fucking horse.

If you don\u2019t understand how to belay and SHE KNOWS IT because she retied your knots, she should have refused to climb until you got it.\n\nI think you could both work together better as partners and treat these things as problems to be solved together. She can slow down and let you learn at your own pace. And you can speak up for yourself if you need a bit more time. Letting her climb when you KNEW you didn\u2019t know how to belay was a truly terrible choice.\n\nGetting frustrated is a completely normal reaction, but the question is how you handle it after.", "INFO: Why would it have been okay for the instructor to tell you you were wrong, but not her?", "YTA.

Additionally, just because she learns it quicker doesn't mean you'll never learn it or will always need help.\n\nThe more you reject her help - the more likely it'll be that you'll need help. \n\nShe doesn't need to correct you everytime. For example, the roller skating was not an area that she should have said anything because it's just a fun little activity to do together...who cares how fast you're going lol.

And if it's not correct, you do need to ask the teacher guy. Should she have been nicer about it? Absolutely, but I'd be pretty scared if I was doing rock climbing and the person holding me up was holding me up wrong. \n\nBUT if she acts like this in other scenarios, you need to run from her. Because it's not acceptable behaviour. Like, ok if it's during something high stress, if she was scared for her safety, etc. It's still not an ideal reaction, but at least understandable.

I married someone who's much smarter than me and didn't have the same obstacles I did.

The giger device is attached to your climbing harness with a carabiner and the rope if fed through. \n\nIf you are the climber you make a knot that is doubled up in the shape of an 8 and then you can make an additional knot if there's slack. \n\nIt's the climbers responsibility to make sure the 8 knot is proper and it's the belayers responsibility to double check that the climber tied in correctly.  \n\nLikely op and his partner were learning how to belay and he incorrectly tied himself in and she told him he didn't do it right.", "Unless the instructor goes with them every time they climb!", "People like to throw around the idea that if the genders were reversed, everything would be different. \n\nThis is definitely one of those posts.\n\n\nIf it was a woman posting about how her boyfriend was getting mad at her for not instantly getting everything perfect during the first day of a class, or being afraid of hurting herself rollerblading, no one would be telling her to suck it up and by thankful she had such a smart boyfriend.", "I kept reading just to count the likes", "She literally belittles him every time he isn't as fast at learning as she is which is absolutely unacceptable he is jealous and that's not good but she is punching down which is probably making him feel even more worthless", "I'm sorry you went through that, but happy that you eventually realized what was going on and did something about it!\n\nWe're supposed to help each other become more, not less...", "True but the climber and belayer are meant to check each other. The GF should be tying her knots properly so I doubt that\u2019s the issue completely, the issue for the belayer is that you need to remember to lock off the carabiner properly. If it\u2019s not locked properly, friction can cause it to open and the rope could slip out, it\u2019s not very common but it is possible.\n\nHaving said that, according to the post OP\u2019s GF was frustrated that he hadn\u2019t tied the knot properly, so I\u2019m not really clear on what the scenario actually was. If OP was tying knots, then it\u2019s only really his safety on the line not hers. However he\u2019s definitely the AH here regardless of what he was doing at climbing, aside from anything else if he can\u2019t master a simple knot he shouldn\u2019t be there.", "Oh ok thanks", "Some guy did this here on this subreddit, he switched the genders on purpose. He [pretending to be a her] told the story. Some guy told \"her\" that \"she\" should divorce \"her\" partner [a \"he\"]. He got like 3k upvotes.", "I'd tell her the same thing I'm about to tell OP - it's okay to have feelings and be jealous, but when it gets to the level of taking it out on the other person, you've reached the point of it being a serious problem.", "No it\u2019s not definitely one of those post considering op is literally complaining about how she\u2019s able to work only a couple hours and he expected her to get fired because he felt she didn\u2019t seem like she worked enough and was surprised she was promoted. He later complains on how she was upset he didn\u2019t pay enough attention when it came to something that could harm her if not done properly. I swear every damn post where op is a man and voted the ah you always have people sprouting about double standards.", "Fantastic! I had to start to tally on paper. I got 13 likes.", "Which makes me wonder if he was even paying attention. My friend taught me to belay. I did mess up the knots a couple times but I mean as someone with zero outdoor/exercise sense, these knots are not that hard.", "But he wanted the instructor to instruct him because he didn\u2019t get it - this is evident from what his girlfriend said to him. He wanted to learn from the teacher, which is fair. I\u2019m not sure why it\u2019s not okay for him to wait for the instructor to come to him when he\u2019s just learning - especially when the instructor is going to every couple in the group and checking before they start the climb. She is rushing him because she is impatient and would rather get to climb than let him take time to learn properly.", "That's why they're taking a class!!!!", "Ok, but they're in a class. Not on the mountain. There's no urgency in the classroom. That's the whole point. You learn how to do it, and THEN you learn how to do it under stress.", "Where are you getting this? And what tf does Felliws mean?", "Yes I agree with you I was just clarifying that the belayer has no knots needing to be tied. It's a simple pully device in which the rope looks like a j. The climber makes an 8 shaped knot and then doubles over. \n\nIt is the climbers duty to make sure the belayer is locked in and it's the belayers duty to make sure the climber is properly tied in. \n\nThis is why in the gym we say \"belay on? (Climber) on belay (belayer)  climb on? (Climber) climb on (belayer) \" this is verbal ques to make sure that we are double checking our safety equipment.\n\nEta: idk why my phone auto corrected but they are funny and I won't change them.", ">He later complains on how she was upset he didn\u2019t pay enough attention when it came to something that could harm her if not done properly.\n\nExcept she ASSUMED he wasn't paying attention. Op literally says:\n\n>I feel frustrated because I wasn't trying to screw around...\n\nOP is jealous. That is a problem. However, his GF's condescending attitude is ALSO a problem. Both have issues they need to communicate."]}
