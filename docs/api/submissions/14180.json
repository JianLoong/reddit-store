He is an involved father, he pitches in with the housework, and he makes enough money for us to be very comfortable while I stay home with our two young children. (I worked before kids and intend to again once they\u2019re both school age.)  He\u2019s the love of my life. \n\nHe\u2019s wonderful - when he\u2019s here.\n\nHe has a dear friend living in a different city 5 hours away, who he usually visits for 2-3 days twice a month. A few time a year they tend to take longer (4-6 day) trips. It adds up to a lot of time away, but it\u2019s in manageable increments and in service to an important friendship that I wouldn\u2019t want him to miss out on.\n\nLast Fall they took a 2 week trip abroad. I knew about it well in advance and was fine with it. I figured it was a one-every-few-years sort of thing. \n\nA month or so after that trip, he tells me they\u2019re planning another overseas trip for this Spring.  This time, it\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always wanted to go; we had previously started to plan a trip there ourselves, but decided it would have to wait until the kids were older. I told him I wasn\u2019t happy but somewhat grudgingly gave my blessing to what was supposed to be a 7-10 day trip.   Same goes for another 5-7 day trip abroad they decided to plan for this Summer, again to a place we had previously talked about going together when kids are older.\n\nAnd then I found out that first the Spring trip and then the Summer trip had ballooned into 3 weeks each.  I got upset. I cried and told him I felt betrayed and abandoned, like he was leaving me here to raise the kids (both trips will now cause him to miss significant kid-related events he knew about before planning) while he just goes on doing what he wants and living his life without me.  He found my response really hurtful, that I would act like he\u2019s abandoning me and the kids, and said that he deserves to have meaningful friendships and see beautiful things. \n\nAm I being unreasonable about this? I feel like I might be, because I haven\u2019t done a good job balancing parenthood and my own social life (I basically don\u2019t have one anymore) and worry I might be speaking from a place of envy than fairness.  And we do also take other trips together as a family.  But two months of international travel in the span of a year seems like a lot.  And when you also add on the bi-monthly hanging out, that\u2019s about 4 months out of town with his friend. (I can count on one hand the number of solo days out I\u2019ve had in the last 3 years with any of my friends, and so again I\u2019m not sure how much this is envy vs unfairness?)\n\nNote: I haven\u2019t yet insisted he cancel any of his trips, but want to ask he at least scale the summer trip back to 1 week instead of 3. So bonus: WIBTA if I insisted he scale back the summer trip to 1 week?", "created_utc": 1680830288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12e4rvg/aita_for_being_upset_by_my_husbands_solo_vacation/", "score": 299, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To spend time with a \u201cfriend?\u201d Yeah\u2026. No. His ass is cheating, whether it\u2019s physical or not.

This time, it\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always wanted to go; we had previously started to plan a trip there ourselves, but decided it would have to wait until the kids were older. I told him I wasn\u2019t happy but somewhat grudgingly gave my blessing to what was supposed to be a 7-10 day trip.   Same goes for another 5-7 day trip abroad they decided to plan for this Summer, again to a place we had previously talked about going together when kids are older.\n\nAnd then I found out that first the Spring trip and then the Summer trip had ballooned into 3 weeks each.  I got upset. I cried and told him I felt betrayed and abandoned, like he was leaving me here to raise the kids (both trips will now cause him to miss significant kid-related events he knew about before planning) while he just goes on doing what he wants and living his life without me.  He found my response really hurtful, that I would act like he\u2019s abandoning me and the kids, and said that he deserves to have meaningful friendships and see beautiful things. \n\nAm I being unreasonable about this? I feel like I might be, because I haven\u2019t done a good job balancing parenthood and my own social life (I basically don\u2019t have one anymore) and worry I might be speaking from a place of envy than fairness.  And we do also take other trips together as a family.  But two months of international travel in the span of a year seems like a lot.  And when you also add on the bi-monthly hanging out, that\u2019s about 4 months out of town with his friend. (I can count on one hand the number of solo days out I\u2019ve had in the last 3 years with any of my friends, and so again I\u2019m not sure how much this is envy vs unfairness?)\n\nNote: I haven\u2019t yet insisted he cancel any of his trips, but want to ask he at least scale the summer trip back to 1 week instead of 3. So bonus: WIBTA if I insisted he scale back the summer trip to 1 week?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I would definitely suggest having more conversations with him (possibly with a couple councilor there as well?) and while I don't think \"tit for tat\" is a healthy way to have a relationship, you should at least get to travel and get rest days like he does, no matter your social circle.\nI'm sorry you're having to navigate this issue, I hope your relationship is stronger and healthier on the other side.", "NTA - time to have a come to Jesus talk with him. This is not normal and you are not out of line or just jealous. You deserve better.", "Your husband is an asshole. Sorry not sorry.", "The good news is that if he can afford these trips then he obviously makes a good enough living that alimony and child support should be a substantial amount. \n\nI literally know no one that would be okay with their spouse traveling with a \u201cfriend \u201c this much leaving you behind. The fact that you even consider you are wrong for being upset tells me that he has manipulated you a lot in your relationship. \n\nThis seems more like he has a whole other family or is having an affair than maintaining an important friendship. If this is not true, then he is just an ass. \n\nMaybe time to hire a private investigator. NTA", "OP, I do not think this is going to end the way you want it to. You could continue to stay home, raise your children and ignore that your marriage continues to grow more and more abnormal.  You put demands on his time and he interprets that as limiting his opportunity for friendship and to see beautiful things.  I think your marriage is starting to circle the drain as your husband seeks more opportunities to be away from you.", "NTA . Please find an excellent attorney with experience in finance forensic investigation", "Whether this guy is having an affair or not, he absolutely sucks. I would lose my mind if my husband even suggested going on an international trip with someone else that we had always discussed doing together, not to mention a SECOND, even without the weeks and weeks away, even without the time away EVERY OTHER WEEKEND, even without saying a bunch of BS about deserving trips and beautiful things with zero awareness that you get NONE of those experiences yourself? What a huge narcissist loser. You are NTA.", "INFO: Have you ever met this \"friend\"? What do you know about them?

Where's your cut. NTA and yes, I would tell him to cut the vacations. You should check finances too. Where's all this travel money coming from? You have a husband problem.", "NTA\n\nHow are you supposed to balance motherhood if he's gone all the time?  Also... I think you need to get your credentials together and re-enter the workforce.  There are some guys who are great at treating you as an equal when you have your own income and *can* walk away, but when you can't start to slowly  erode boundaries and degrade the level of treatment towards you.  Because you're trapped, they prioritize other people who could leave over you.\n\nGet your own income and push back.  Taking his friend on your dream vacations is pretty cruel.  Especially when he's trying to triple the length of the trips without asking.", "Aside from the obvious point everyone is making about this not being normal behavior and he's probably having an affair, but the fact that you two were planning a trip previously that you wanted to go to and he is decided to spend it without you for weeks with someone else at THE SAME PLACE is F'd up.   Clearly NTA", "So, y'all, which one of these trips with his boyfriend is their honeymoon?", "NTA\nThey usually don't see the error of their ways until after you have to uproot your family and are just settling in and being your own person again. By that time, the heartbreak of your children will have erased any leftover feelings you may have had. This way, he gets to be a victim for the rest of your children's lives while your heart breaks for them over and over. I could be wrong, but it is an old and sadly repetitive story. The outcome rarely changes. Save yourself some time while your children are still little and start over with them. The dream of the family unit dies hard, but it was not you who broke it. He does not give a care because he is seeing beautiful things. There are beautiful things at home right in front of him, that he does not see.\nI wish you strength and good fortune.", "Hell, I have several super close best friends from childhood, who live 10-30 minutes. With our busy lives, I can sometimes not see them for a whole month, in busier times even two months. Same thing with some of my close college friends that also live about 10-30 mins from me. And this guy is driving five hours, staying 2 to 3 days, twice a month??? I\u2019ve been trying to schedule to see my cousin and her baby who lives about 2-3 hours from me for *months.*  \n\nOP, his behavior reeks. This is suspicious as fuck. Going on lavish trips, abroad with this \u201cfriend\u201d and never with you??? For extended periods of time?? Not even offering to give you time off to do a trip with your friends?? No no no you are not being unreasonable. And that friend is not just a friend.\n\nNTA", "The visits for 2-3 days twice a month, that is every other weekend.

He can find a new place", "Strikes me as weird that only he travels to see his friend twice a month, this friend never travels to see him", "Or he has a second family", "This is the way. Find a family member to travel with or take a group tour if you don\u2019t want to travel alone but take some time away.

Also agree with all the comments that he\u2019s having some type of affair.", "I\u2019ve never been so sure someone has a second family, even it\u2019s just another spouse.", "Let's be real: This isn't \"solo\" vacation travel. This is travel that leaves you behind. There's a difference.", "He is living a double life essentially. If this friend is man, he's probably gay.", "Agreed! This is not a platonic friendship.", "OP update please!!", "This is the way!", "Well given that she\u2019s the one on here asking if she\u2019s the AH, it sounds like she\u2019s the one who acquiesces in the relationship and over time he\u2019s taken advantage of this power dynamic. So much that he\u2019s probably got a second life going on now", "The husband could be having an affair with the friend.", "Yep. I wouldn't have time to be upset because I'd be planning my solo 6 week vacation of a lifetime.", "Exactly this!!!", "Same", "Ooh...I hope OP reads this!", "Beautiful things=at least one other naked person no doubt.", "Ooops that should say twice a month. Sorry", "And it\u2019s five hours away!!", "The friend is definitely a woman just by the sheer fact OP didn\u2019t mention gender. OP knew if she mentioned female friend we would jump to affair bur didn\u2019t realize we\u2019d all nonetheless call BS on her husband despite gender of the friend. Additionally I bet the husband has made it clear it\u2019s a mistress and that OP just needs to deal. She knows what\u2019s happening and has decided to stay.", "Exactly! My first thought was is this really a \u201cfriend\u201d?", "Why does she suck?", "I wouldn't write a drama novel or a TV episode with the plot OP described because it's too obvious. Everyone would see right through it.", "I definitely like your attitude, and if it can be done, that's the way to go.\r  \n\r  \nI didn't suggest it because I don't know whose name is on the deed, and getting the legal right to bar him from the house could take longer than she has.", "True.  That is making me lean towards second family since this friend never visits and he always goes there.", "My thoughts exactly", "Yeah, totally has that affair vibe. Traveling that much with a \"just a friend\" is suspicious.", "He's probably gay and his \"friend\" is a boyfriend", "Maybe... As OP has clearly shown...
