He is an involved father, he pitches in with the housework, and he makes enough money for us to be very comfortable while I stay home with our two young children. (I worked before kids and intend to again once they\u2019re both school age.)  He\u2019s the love of my life. \n\nHe\u2019s wonderful - when he\u2019s here.\n\nHe has a dear friend living in a different city 5 hours away, who he usually visits for 2-3 days twice a month. A few time a year they tend to take longer (4-6 day) trips. It adds up to a lot of time away, but it\u2019s in manageable increments and in service to an important friendship that I wouldn\u2019t want him to miss out on.\n\nLast Fall they took a 2 week trip abroad. I knew about it well in advance and was fine with it. I figured it was a one-every-few-years sort of thing. \n\nA month or so after that trip, he tells me they\u2019re planning another overseas trip for this Spring.  This time, it\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always wanted to go; we had previously started to plan a trip there ourselves, but decided it would have to wait until the kids were older. I told him I wasn\u2019t happy but somewhat grudgingly gave my blessing to what was supposed to be a 7-10 day trip.   Same goes for another 5-7 day trip abroad they decided to plan for this Summer, again to a place we had previously talked about going together when kids are older.\n\nAnd then I found out that first the Spring trip and then the Summer trip had ballooned into 3 weeks each.  I got upset. I cried and told him I felt betrayed and abandoned, like he was leaving me here to raise the kids (both trips will now cause him to miss significant kid-related events he knew about before planning) while he just goes on doing what he wants and living his life without me.  He found my response really hurtful, that I would act like he\u2019s abandoning me and the kids, and said that he deserves to have meaningful friendships and see beautiful things. \n\nAm I being unreasonable about this? I feel like I might be, because I haven\u2019t done a good job balancing parenthood and my own social life (I basically don\u2019t have one anymore) and worry I might be speaking from a place of envy than fairness.  And we do also take other trips together as a family.  But two months of international travel in the span of a year seems like a lot.  And when you also add on the bi-monthly hanging out, that\u2019s about 4 months out of town with his friend. (I can count on one hand the number of solo days out I\u2019ve had in the last 3 years with any of my friends, and so again I\u2019m not sure how much this is envy vs unfairness?)\n\nNote: I haven\u2019t yet insisted he cancel any of his trips, but want to ask he at least scale the summer trip back to 1 week instead of 3. So bonus: WIBTA if I insisted he scale back the summer trip to 1 week?", "created_utc": 1680830288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12e4rvg/aita_for_being_upset_by_my_husbands_solo_vacation/", "score": 6550, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To spend time with a \u201cfriend?\u201d Yeah\u2026. No. His ass is cheating, whether it\u2019s physical or not.

This time, it\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always wanted to go; we had previously started to plan a trip there ourselves, but decided it would have to wait until the kids were older. I told him I wasn\u2019t happy but somewhat grudgingly gave my blessing to what was supposed to be a 7-10 day trip.   Same goes for another 5-7 day trip abroad they decided to plan for this Summer, again to a place we had previously talked about going together when kids are older.\n\nAnd then I found out that first the Spring trip and then the Summer trip had ballooned into 3 weeks each.  I got upset. I cried and told him I felt betrayed and abandoned, like he was leaving me here to raise the kids (both trips will now cause him to miss significant kid-related events he knew about before planning) while he just goes on doing what he wants and living his life without me.  He found my response really hurtful, that I would act like he\u2019s abandoning me and the kids, and said that he deserves to have meaningful friendships and see beautiful things. \n\nAm I being unreasonable about this? I feel like I might be, because I haven\u2019t done a good job balancing parenthood and my own social life (I basically don\u2019t have one anymore) and worry I might be speaking from a place of envy than fairness.  And we do also take other trips together as a family.  But two months of international travel in the span of a year seems like a lot.  And when you also add on the bi-monthly hanging out, that\u2019s about 4 months out of town with his friend. (I can count on one hand the number of solo days out I\u2019ve had in the last 3 years with any of my friends, and so again I\u2019m not sure how much this is envy vs unfairness?)\n\nNote: I haven\u2019t yet insisted he cancel any of his trips, but want to ask he at least scale the summer trip back to 1 week instead of 3. So bonus: WIBTA if I insisted he scale back the summer trip to 1 week?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why on earth would he come with the \"I deserve travel and meaningful relationships\" comment, it goes both ways!", "The problem with eye for an eye approach is these kids need actual parenting, not to be the collateral damage in their parent\u2019s fucked up marriage. Bad enough they have a self-involved, neglectful dad, who will probably never change.", "2 months of travel with a friend and not your wife and kids is also nuts. Let's not encourage OP to settle for anything less than this madness ending. I have had the luxury of having a best friend since I was 3; we go on one trip a year, for no more than a week. My husband does the same with his buddies. \n\nOP, wake up and smell the rejection. You're not his partner. I don't know what is going on but it's not normal. I agree with the recommendation to hire a private investigator.", "Agreed, wiser to hire a PI before raising any more ruckus/confrontation. The more she has documented in advance the easier the divorce settlement will be.", "\n>You don't have a social life because he isn't there to help raise the children you made together while he spends 4 months on trips and hangouts with his friend. \n\nEXACTLY!!!!\n\nIt's not that OP has done a terrible job balancing her home life and social life, it's that her husband has left her with almost no room to have a social life!\n2-3 days every second weekend is A LOT! Never mind the extended vacations and the new extended extended vacations. \n\nEven if it were 2-3 days every month it would still a bit much when you have kids that aren't even school age yet but could be justified if husband made sure OP got 2-3 days away with friends every month. But it sure as shit doesn't sound like he's doing that.\n\nHaving kids and having small kids is tough. The tranisition from carefree childfree life to caring for smallies is a massive one, especially if you've given up work to stay at home. Even with a partner who *doesn't* run off for a week every month, most stay at home parents find it tremendously difficult to deal with the impact kids have on their social life.\n\nWhether or not OPs husband is having an affair or not (and this post really reads like he is) OPs husband is definitely running away from his home life and is showing absolutely no consideration for the massive upheavel and tranisition that OP has under gone; going from no kids and working to stay at home parent.\n\nAnd then there's the fact he's chosing to go places that he knows his wife wants to go to and he's doing it for weeks at a time? Don't even get me started on this one because that's beyond insensitive, it's straight up cruel to OP. \n\nNTA OP, but your husband certainly is.", "I thought I was being crazy for noticing that but combed through and realized a pronoun was never stated. Honestly would it even make a difference at this point", "Right. Sneaking off pursuing an affair but with clock like regularity sounds like a court agreement.", "I'd be leaving my husband if he left 6 days a month to hang out with a \"friend.\" Sounds like he doesn't gaf about how his wife feels and doesn't want to participate in their lives as much as he should. I feel bad for leaving my husband and kids for anything above 4 hours. I can't imagine leaving them for days like that.", "I'd also say his behavior is totally unacceptable even if there's nothing else going on.  Going on vacations to places OP wants to go but telling her she can't because of the kids is just awful.", "[removed]", "OP my dad was home far more than this. He was home everyday but worked \"some nights\", but was always there in the morning as we were getting up for school and only had maybe 3 \"work trips\" my entire childhood. I was 24 when I discovered he had an entire second family, and I had to be the one to tell my mother (his wife) and break her heart. Granted it was easier for him because his other woman and daughter live in the same city as us, but he managed it for at least 27 years without getting caught with far less conspicuous absences than your husband\n\nI know it sounds like the internet overreacting and I would not wish the coming pain on anyone, but there is a near zero chance he is just visiting \"a friend\" this often. You said he is a good, involved father, but he isn't. He's abandoning the kids regularly because he knows you take care of them and he doesn't have to do more than the bare minimum. You haven't failed at having a social life, he has manipulated you into not having one because it better suits his needs for his affair\n\nIf you can, give us an update with what you find when you uncover the truth about where he's constantly going. I'll be thinking of you and your children", "NTA. Your husband clearly does not want to be married. Let him pay you child support and possibly alimony, enough so you can take some trips while he has the kids on his custodial times.", "So your husband is spending every other weekend with his friend??? And going on all these holidays .... you have a third person in your relationship", "This happened to a friend of mine too. Her dad was wealthy. But he traveled a lot for work. When she was 19 it burst open that there was another woman with 2 kids around ages 6 and 9.", "First thought was brokeback mountain. Second thought was the friend was a cover for his girlfriend. I would be checking in with the friend independently (give him a call, or stalk his social media).", "[removed]", "I\u2019m so sorry that happened to you. You deserve so much better.", "[removed]", "This man definitely has another family!  He\u2019s taking vacation trips in spring and summer? Sounds like Spring Break and Summer Vacation from school. Oh My! You need a PI to follow him on these trips and see what he\u2019s really doing.", "It's irrelevant what gender the friend is. He can be having an affair with a man, too.", "[removed]", "OP needs to pack the bags and put his socks in the tackle box. If OP never finds his socks then she will know that OP never opened the tackle box. My grandma did this to my grandpa but the socks were put in the hunting gun case. She accused him of not hunting and it turns out she was right. He was pissed when came home and said she didn\u2019t pack any of his socks.", "Right, empty it or something else he \"uses\" on his vacation trips, and see if he even mentions it. \ud83e\udd23", "[removed]", "Agree wholeheartedly, even if there is no cheating or affair involved the level of selfishness of him guilting her about deserving good things while she has given up her entire social life...that would be enough for me to seek out a divorce lawyer.", "Lol, yeah, I forgot, she is also a baby maker! Well, he does need to ensure that he has children on all continents for when he gets old. He will still want to travel when he is old, so it\u2019s important to have carers in all locations!", "I thought the friend was a woman due to how OP specifically didn\u2019t mention the sec of the friend. She knows that if we all knew it was a woman we\u2019d for real think he is cheating. Regardless, OP isn\u2019t even sort of a priority and OP should be alone of with someone who actually cares.", "[removed]", "If they're in the US, spring ahead...", "You deserve to see beautiful things too.\n\nA divorce attorney, for example.\n\nNTA", "You should allow him to take his 3 to 4 week vacations all over the world. While he's away you need to be securing a safe place for yourself and your children to live. You need to file for divorce so he can be served as soon as he returns. \n\nYour husband and his \"friend\" are having an affair OR the friend trips are a cover up for another relationship he has with someone else.\n\nEither way get yourself ahead of the game.", "I wonder if OP has actually ever met the friend. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s specified in the post.", "The good news here is that divorce won\u2019t change the dynamic much. He already acts like he\u2019s divorced and only needs to provide his wife money and see his kids on his days. I would just go ahead and make that arrangement official. Then OP can do her own trips during his custody/visitation.", "Yes!!! Being a full-time stay at home mother warrants a break/trip too. I noticed OP said something about how he\u2019s an involved dad who makes money for her to live comfortably and stay home. I hope she realizes that that doesn\u2019t mean having to acquiesce to or tolerate excessive vacation and break time from him just because he makes money and that\u2019s seen as the \u201creal\u201d job. She doesn\u2019t really get consistent time with other adults, doesn\u2019t get a lot of alone time during the day, etc etc", "This is the first thing that came to my mind. The husband is either gay/bi and his friend is actually a lover, or it\u2019s another woman/family of his.\n\nThere\u2019s no other way around it. 2-3 day visits twice a month and weeks long multiple overseas trips a year with a \u201cfriend\u201d? People aren\u2019t even seeing their siblings and parents, including elderly and ailing ones that often nowadays, let alone a \u201cfriend\u201d when you have a wife and kids to take care of.\n\nOP is NTA, she\u2019s a victim and she has the choice to either confront him directly about all of this or to leave while he\u2019s on one of those \u201cfriend visits\u201d, unless she\u2019s ok being a live-nanny and housekeeper for the rest of her life.", "OP, I'm hopping onto the top comment because I knew a woman who tolerated something similar; it turns out her husband's \"business\" travel was to have custody and visitation with his FIVE children from a previous relationship.\n\nI don't know what's going on here, but it's NOT normal. Emotional or physical, second family or not, he is using you as his housekeeper, nanny, and side piece while he goes and lives a whole separate life. And with being a sahm, you are at his financial will.\n\nIf you can swing it, hire a PI. Hell, can you pick up some random gigs while he's gone to store away your own money? You need an exit plan.\n\nNTA right now, but you will be one if you continue to send the message to your children that this is how a man should treat his wife.", "All of this! These are the types of posts I so wish we got updates on.", "She should check in with this \u201cdear friend\u201d and see how much he enjoyed those last few trips. At least then she would know whether hubby is cheating with a man or a woman.", "Yeah when I read that he goes there for a weekend twice a month, that's a LOT of time to be leaving toyed wife home with the kids. Going to a location she's always wanted to go is mean and not considering her feelings. No wonder OP has no social life, she hardly has time to around her husband's social life", "NTA I can see how someone can lead a double life doing this.", "I wonder how many times OP\u2019s husband and his \u201cfriend\u201d have sat back and laughed at how easy it is for him to buffalo OP, then make her feel like she\u2019s being unreasonable.\n\nOP, NTA - but please, for your own sanity, invest some resources into finding out what is actually going on. \n\nYou should start documenting things, because if you decide to face the truth, your husband is *really* going to turn on the mind games. Things he says and does won\u2019t be so easy to slip under the rug if you have them recorded. It may also be easier for you to look at the laundry list of things that are happening as a whole, and realize that this is NOT OKAY.", "Absolutely this. I almost wondered if OP is married to my ex. He used to go on a ton of trips with his bestie. Who a mutual friend later told me my ex had slept with. (Male friend, when my husband claimed to be hetero.) He had cheated a ton already even when our marriage was open. FYI it's still cheating if you're in an open marriage and you break boundaries. My ex went on a 2 week trip after I had just got out of the hospital.  International trip and I was unable to reach him via phone the whole time. Had friends stay with me, since I couldn't be alone. \n\nLawyer up. Keep a record of all the trips to show how much he's around.", "I'm in the same boat, and thankfully we've been able to make time to see those friends, but even then we *all* get together about *once* a week, partners and husbands.

Usually, this includes a larger group, i.e., club or team. Then there's all the associated equipment he would speak of, at least before dropping \"To see beautiful things\"... it's nonsense. Who says that... especially when it concerns something they're passionate in. \n\nWhatever it may be, I would appreciate a partner half as lenient as OP.

On the contrary, your gaslighting husband is the asshole here, but you need to wake up and smell the coffee.", "Provided your budget allows and OP gets the same opportunity, one trip a year to visit a friend is reasonable.
