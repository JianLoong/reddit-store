He is an involved father, he pitches in with the housework, and he makes enough money for us to be very comfortable while I stay home with our two young children. (I worked before kids and intend to again once they\u2019re both school age.)  He\u2019s the love of my life. \n\nHe\u2019s wonderful - when he\u2019s here.\n\nHe has a dear friend living in a different city 5 hours away, who he usually visits for 2-3 days twice a month. A few time a year they tend to take longer (4-6 day) trips. It adds up to a lot of time away, but it\u2019s in manageable increments and in service to an important friendship that I wouldn\u2019t want him to miss out on.\n\nLast Fall they took a 2 week trip abroad. I knew about it well in advance and was fine with it. I figured it was a one-every-few-years sort of thing. \n\nA month or so after that trip, he tells me they\u2019re planning another overseas trip for this Spring.  This time, it\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always wanted to go; we had previously started to plan a trip there ourselves, but decided it would have to wait until the kids were older. I told him I wasn\u2019t happy but somewhat grudgingly gave my blessing to what was supposed to be a 7-10 day trip.   Same goes for another 5-7 day trip abroad they decided to plan for this Summer, again to a place we had previously talked about going together when kids are older.\n\nAnd then I found out that first the Spring trip and then the Summer trip had ballooned into 3 weeks each.  I got upset. I cried and told him I felt betrayed and abandoned, like he was leaving me here to raise the kids (both trips will now cause him to miss significant kid-related events he knew about before planning) while he just goes on doing what he wants and living his life without me.  He found my response really hurtful, that I would act like he\u2019s abandoning me and the kids, and said that he deserves to have meaningful friendships and see beautiful things. \n\nAm I being unreasonable about this? I feel like I might be, because I haven\u2019t done a good job balancing parenthood and my own social life (I basically don\u2019t have one anymore) and worry I might be speaking from a place of envy than fairness.  And we do also take other trips together as a family.  But two months of international travel in the span of a year seems like a lot.  And when you also add on the bi-monthly hanging out, that\u2019s about 4 months out of town with his friend. (I can count on one hand the number of solo days out I\u2019ve had in the last 3 years with any of my friends, and so again I\u2019m not sure how much this is envy vs unfairness?)\n\nNote: I haven\u2019t yet insisted he cancel any of his trips, but want to ask he at least scale the summer trip back to 1 week instead of 3. So bonus: WIBTA if I insisted he scale back the summer trip to 1 week?", "created_utc": 1680830288, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12e4rvg/aita_for_being_upset_by_my_husbands_solo_vacation/", "score": 1965, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

To spend time with a \u201cfriend?\u201d Yeah\u2026. No. His ass is cheating, whether it\u2019s physical or not. He\u2019s stealing time and money and emotional energy that rightfully ought to be directed towards his wife and children. He\u2019s taking advantage of you and treating you like a live-in nanny.

If he really thinks it's reasonable for him to have these trips, then he should see no reason for you to not have equally lavish solo trips.

I knew about it well in advance and was fine with it. I figured it was a one-every-few-years sort of thing. \n\nA month or so after that trip, he tells me they\u2019re planning another overseas trip for this Spring.  This time, it\u2019s a place I\u2019ve always wanted to go; we had previously started to plan a trip there ourselves, but decided it would have to wait until the kids were older. I told him I wasn\u2019t happy but somewhat grudgingly gave my blessing to what was supposed to be a 7-10 day trip.   Same goes for another 5-7 day trip abroad they decided to plan for this Summer, again to a place we had previously talked about going together when kids are older.\n\nAnd then I found out that first the Spring trip and then the Summer trip had ballooned into 3 weeks each.  I got upset. I cried and told him I felt betrayed and abandoned, like he was leaving me here to raise the kids (both trips will now cause him to miss significant kid-related events he knew about before planning) while he just goes on doing what he wants and living his life without me.  He found my response really hurtful, that I would act like he\u2019s abandoning me and the kids, and said that he deserves to have meaningful friendships and see beautiful things. \n\nAm I being unreasonable about this? I feel like I might be, because I haven\u2019t done a good job balancing parenthood and my own social life (I basically don\u2019t have one anymore) and worry I might be speaking from a place of envy than fairness.  And we do also take other trips together as a family.  But two months of international travel in the span of a year seems like a lot.  And when you also add on the bi-monthly hanging out, that\u2019s about 4 months out of town with his friend. (I can count on one hand the number of solo days out I\u2019ve had in the last 3 years with any of my friends, and so again I\u2019m not sure how much this is envy vs unfairness?)\n\nNote: I haven\u2019t yet insisted he cancel any of his trips, but want to ask he at least scale the summer trip back to 1 week instead of 3. So bonus: WIBTA if I insisted he scale back the summer trip to 1 week?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

That is not fair to you. Heck, it isn't even fair to him because you are doing all of the parenting his relationship with your children is obviously going to suffer. So, I would sit him down and ask some clear questions, based on those answers I'd recommend moving on to some clear boundaries. Go into the discussion understanding what your objectives are. How do you want this to look, what do you need from him, what do you need to happen? Now, it may end up in counseling, it may end up in divorce court.

He's leaving his wife to be a lone parent for an unreasonable length of time, shows no interest in vacationing with her and denies her the same opportunity that he demands as his right to socialise and \"see beautiful things\". \n\nThere are four main possibilities at this stage: \n* he likes pretending to be single when he's with his friend, and uses the time to pull one-night stands;\n* there's some sort of queer-platonic frisson between him and his friend that he hasn't noticed but still prioritises over time spent with his wife and family;\n* he's actively having an affair with his friend;\n*he's having an affair with someone else and pretending to visit his friend.\n\nHalf of those involve him being not exactly straight, and the other half involve a level of deception that's hard to maintain in the long term because there's more people involved. Ockham's razor says the most likely situation is the simplest explanation, which is that when he expresses the intent of seeing his friend, it really is the friend that he's prioritising over his wife and family.\n\nBut at the end of the day, whether the relationship is actively sexual or not, he's still being unfaithful to his wife.
