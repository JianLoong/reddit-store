Sounds like the wedding might be better without your brother & SIL present.", ">He is debating coming to the wedding if I don't ask her to be one.\n\nVery manipulative. NTA", "NTA. By the sounds of it, it would be no loss if they did not come. Tell your mom you love her but this is *your* wedding and you are the bride. It's the bride who is supposed to get what they want. Don't put that added stress on yourself.", "NTA - She *HAD* her wedding, so what if you were in it.  I don't get why it's so important to reciprocate in these things.  It's *YOUR* wedding, do what makes **YOU HAPPY**!", "NTA.\n\nyour brother and his wife need a reality check, not everything is personal nor is it an obligation that because she had you as a bridesmaid means that you have make her yours.", "NTA\n\nGoing by this logic someone who has been a bridesmaid 10 times should have 10 bridesmaids in addition to anyone else she wants? Wedding parties would be huge!", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR wedding. You and your partner have final say. People always want to impose on weddings that aren\u2019t theirs. Continue to surround yourself with the people you are close to. Everyone else can deal.", "NTA - You know what type of people they are, and it honestly sounds better if they do not come. Let him know that you are 100% ok if he doe snot come. Let your mom know that your brother is the one making the choice, not you, as your wedding, your rules. If she cannot support that, then she needs to look at how she treats her children's autonomy.", "NTA. Here is what I don\u2019t get first and foremost why if you have had to force someone against their will, would you still want that position? Think about it, your SIL is comfortable to practically bully you by applying pressure through her tantrums and getting your brother (her husband) and your mother to ask the same of you. This woman is happy to attend as bridesmaid in the knowledge she literally is not wanted nor chosen and has forced her way into your wedding party. I understand wanting to appease your mother but she honestly will get over it, remember she also had her day, this one is yours. Don\u2019t feel obliged to perform insincere acts on your wedding day like having your brother and his wife the Queen of Sheba over there dictate it to you. If your brother chooses not to attend because his blackmail tactics didn\u2019t work, he is the only one who is going to look like the total bellend he appears to be. \u2764\ufe0f\n\nEdit: In fact!

I guess people forgot who\u2019s wedding it is. And that you get chosen, not picked by default. If she didn\u2019t get chosen, maybe it\u2019s up to her to reflect why that is.

Yet she wants to play dress-up and be a bridesmaid? That is just bizarre.\n\nGive her a role - have her in charge of the guestbook, or of collecting the gifts people bring. If you want to do more, she can do a brief reading at the ceremony. Ask her to wear the same bridesmaids dress as everybody else. \n\nThat way she is there, she gets to play dress-up - but she's not standing up pretending to be your closest bud.", "NAH.

I didn't mean that! I got married in my 30s and had a gaggle of my best friends as bridesmaids!\n\nI meant that SIL isn't OP's friend; she wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid, why would someone who should be mature enough (past, at, or near 30) at this point want to make demands and rile up the brother just to put on a matchy dress and stand at the altar for someone she's not even friendly with?\n\nAll I could think of was that she wanted to play dress-up. Simply don't understand the SIL here AT ALL."]}
