I also have routines I follow (mostly in the morning and before bed) that help me function and keep my ADHD from running/ruining my life. E.g., no matter what day it is, every morning when I wake up I: make the bed, use the restroom, wash my face, make coffee, do the rest of my morning skincare routine, change out of pjs into my outfit for the day, have coffee and something to eat, and then brush my teeth.

He's doing this to himself and to you. I honestly think this is the time you tell him he gets the medicine or gets it together because when this baby comes, he won't have the luxury of forgetting the baby's diaper needs changing, or where the pacifier is, or when it's food time, and he won't have you to run around as his errand girl either. You need to make a stand now, not later. NTA", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet him in touch with a professional who helps him develop strateges to manage his life better. YOU are NOT his mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is such a thing as shopping lists, todo lists, planning your day, ...", "NTA and contrary to what he's saying he is asking for quite a bit. You're picking up a significant amount of mental load for another adult human, and adult humans have a lot of shit going on at any given time. The constant need for vigilance with him is honestly really taxing over time, because it's just another thing on your plate all the time that never goes away.\n\nI have ADHD, I completely understand the issues he's having. I can't tell you how many times I've gone over to my parents' house *expressly* to bring them something from my apartment, only to have forgotten what I was going to bring because I was too focused on remembering I needed to go over there. It's a huge pain in the ass!\n\nBut he needs to make some changes to do what he can to help himself. ADHD, like I just said, is a huge pain in the ass, unmedicated ADHD in my experience is even more difficult (I have to pick up slack for my aging mother who also has unmedicated ADHD so I understand your position) but it doesn't make you helpless, or stupid, or anything like that.\n\nThe problem I'm seeing is that he's not working on developing coping strategies for his memory issues and is instead relying on you to be his memory. What worries me about this is if it's like this now, it's going to be *so* much worse when the baby comes. You're not going to have the bandwidth for being his memory! Since he doesn't seem to have strategies to rely on when you're not there, plus all household routines and stuff will be in total chaos for a while he's going to have an even *worse* time with his memory. So then you're looking at managing yourself, your part of the baby care, his memory, making sure he doesn't forget things for his part of the baby care, etc. You see how it actually comes out to being quite a bit to put on one person?\n\nThe biggest thing I can suggest for right now is work with him to make sure things have a very specific place in the house for him to find. Like the bags for shopping can live by the front door, or near where he puts his shoes on. Grouping activities helps me remember them, which is why I say near the shoes or something like that.\n\nHe should be making lists either by hand or on his phone. I write down literally everything or I will NOT remember it and my ADHD is pretty well managed between my meds and doing research to see what works for me.\n\nIf he forgets items that are easy to retrieve, as much as it sucks, he should start coming up to get them. Having to deal with a consequence I'd rather not deal with sometimes helps me take a minute to be more mindful.\n\nAnother trick I employ often is telling my roommate \"Hey, don't let me forget x.\" He almost never needs to remind me, because I'll remember \"Oh yeah I told him I wanted x.\" Basically like, setting up things that can trigger remembering what was important is what this is all about.\n\nI hope he's open to maybe doing some therapy around it, because it sounds like it does bother him quite a bit to forget things like this (I know it upsets me) and it would improve his quality of life significantly to have that help, and I think it would be a great help for you, too.", "NTA. I have adhd and manage a household by my self so he has no excuse.\n\nArrange grocery pickup or have a smart home device that you can tell to add items to grocery list as soon as they run out. You can pull the list up on your phone and check them off.\n\nSetting reminders on a smart device will alert the device AND text your phone the reminder. You can also snooze the reminder if you can't do it that second.", "I have ADHD and am extremely forgetful as well. It's very hard on my husband, but I do everything in power to minimize the impact it has on him. I also pretty much run the family. I keep a running pickup order open all week that I add things to a I remember them, then submit it Friday night for Saturday pickup. I wake up before everyone else so I can drink my coffee and have time to remember everything that needs to be done. I set reminders on my phone, keep all my keys and bags together, etc. And I go to the therapist and medicate!

He's not going to learn with this system you've set up. \n\nNTA, but let him fail.", "Just make sure you\u2019re still supportive and reassuring about not doing things for him anymore. I understand him feeling upset. There are lots of things that I can\u2019t help and need understanding for. I\u2019ve been shamed in the past for those things as well which compounds my sensitivity to having my shortcomings pointed out. \n\nThat said, I don\u2019t like people treating me like I can\u2019t do anything. If my partner picks up after me, I get upset because I know he\u2019s annoyed and I would have done it if he\u2019d just gently reminded me. That\u2019s just one example but you get the picture. My partner and I have had lots of conversations about how to work with my adhd and his autism and I am always saying \u201cI just need a gentle reminder\u201d. Gentle being the operative word. \n\nIdk how the convo went between you but make sure that you guys are having conversations about how you are going to work with his adhd and a child and what have you. Keep it kind and respectful and remember that a) it\u2019s not your job to make sure things get done and b) his brain is different than most and he needs to feel accepted. Maybe just simply say that you guys need to work together to figure out how you are going to help each other out and what each of you can do to contribute to that. Things like hanging the bags in the door or setting a reminder for you to remind him of important calls. If he doesn\u2019t leave the kitchen area while cooking, he\u2019s less likely to get distracted. The other thing I would recommend is that you ask him what you can do to help him in a way that doesn\u2019t make you be his parent. Let him advocate for himself. \n\nAlso remember that adhd means emotional regulation issues-especially when he\u2019s not taking meds. So that little bit of reassurance is very important. Positive feedback helps too. Even if it feels silly.", "NTA, I'm only a young adult and I have mild ADHD. If I'm cooking something on the stove, I always set a timer to check it.

Unmedicated adhd often times leads to mental illness, such as depression and anxiety. \n\nIt sounds like he doesn\u2019t even have bare minimum coping skills. He\u2019s not functioning as an independent adult. And now you guys are bringing an innocent child into this. A child you will have to almost exclusively take care of because you\u2019re already taking care of a man who is dependent on you. If he can\u2019t even grocery shop, he\u2019s not going to be able to take care of a child. Full stop. \n\nFix it now or things will just get so much worse for both of you. You\u2019ll end up resenting him more, he\u2019ll end up feeling like crap. The baby will get caught in the middle. Stop enabling him.", "NTA. I have ADHD. As another commenter said, stop bailing him out and let him deal with it himself. There are plenty of treatment options that don't include medication, and there are plenty of coping mechanisms he can try. \n\nHe needs to get a handle on this before the baby comes, or it'll be a nightmare.", "NTA, but you aren't helping your situation. Don't bail him out. If he doesn't want to get medical help for his ADHD, he needs to put systems in place on his own that will allow him to function. \n\nEven when my partner is unmedicated, he needs support, but he isn't weaponizing his ADHD.", "NTA. \n\nHe\u2019s choosing to do jackshit about his ADHD. If he was flying solo and wanted to remain unmedicated or otherwise do nothing about his neurodivergence, no problem! He and he alone can enjoy the consequences of his own in/actions. But he\u2019s going to become a husband and father so no, he doesn\u2019t get to just let you pick up all the slack. And you\u2019re pregnant for christsakes! You are in no position/condition to be taking care of him like this; he should be taking care of *you*.\n\nNEWSFLASH: You\u2019re not pregnant with your first child, you\u2019re pregnant with your *second* child.

Why do you \u2018totally understand that?\u2019 4 out of 5 members of my household have ADHD.

I looked it up while I was pregnant. Couldn't find the odds if both parents have ADHD, which was what I was really looking for. Both my husband and I have severe ADHD. The worst that's happened with the baby is we forgot the diaper bag once (ended up putting bare bones emergency diaper changing kits in both cars in case it happens again), and once I forgot to put a fresh diaper on the kid after changing her. So I handed her over to husband in a sleeper but no diaper...and then she peed. But we both get proper treatment and take our meds. Which OP's husband should also be doing.", "Would coping mechanisms for ADHD be equally useful to teach to any child to learn how to manage their time, etc?", "This. He needs to manage his issues and you have to make him. Stop coddling him he has to get his mental health issues under control.

I have my own mental health issues and have no sympathy for people who don't even try", "The lists and the saying \u201cdon\u2019t let me forget x\u201d are so true for me. My husband and I keep an ongoing shared notes app of our to-dos (dry cleaning, taxes, vet appt etc) and a shared note for our groceries. We add things in the moment throughout the week and pick our dinners for the week and make an exact list. We check the items off as we get them in the store. I have a personal to do on my phone too with very basic stuff on it and it helps a lot.", "Ehh this is pretty dramatic. I have ADHD, and I often have to go back in the house because I forgot something. But forgetting my lunch for work and forgetting a child is an entirely different thing! \n\nI don't have kids, but I have pets. I don't forget to give them food and water or take them out or anything. \n\nOP should stop babying him and let him come back inside and get his own grocery bags, but acting like he's going to be a neglectful father is a bit much.", "I\u2019m going to second couples counseling. My partner also has ADHD and couples counseling finally helped provide the accountability he needed to make some of these small but powerful changes.

There are things you can actively do now to help stop peeing yourself, and regain continence.

But he *can* help his reaction to it, which appears to be doing absolutely nothing whatsoever and just assuming you\u2019ll pick up the slack for him. He IS asking a lot. He is asking you to keep track not only of your life and schedule but also of his, and to drop everything to accommodate him when he (constantly) forgets things. If he absolutely positively refuses to even consider medication and setting alarms isn\u2019t working, there are *plenty* of other ways for him to work on these things. As just one example, therapy might help him to build coping mechanisms. \n\nRegardless, and even if he ultimately decides he doesn\u2019t want to do anything about it, that doesn\u2019t make it *your* responsibility to pick up the slack, especially when you are pregnant.", "NTA and oh honey.....you think it's tough now? How about when the baby actually comes!? You will officially be a mother of 2", "Stop answering the phone. Don't bring the bags down for him. You're enabling him.

I would enforce this 100%, otherwise you\u2019ll end up being his full time carer.", "NTA. As someone with ADHD who's hanging out to get medicated because I've seen the difference, if your boyfriend won't medicate then it's up to him to develop alternate strategies. Even if you weren't pregnant this behaviour sound like a nightmare.

How do you expect him to parent with you when he won't even take care of his responsibilities on his own now?", "Why doesn't he want to be medicated? This whole taboo against meds thing needs to end. There is nothing wrong with taking meds if they help you. I have ADHD and Adderall changed my life. I can focus and get things done because I remember things. I'm more productive than I've ever been.

A bit of help here and there is fine, but it\u2019s like you\u2019re taking care of a giant child right now. He needs to go to therapy and find an ADHD life coach to learn some skills and techniques of managing his ADHD. It\u2019s not 100%, but it makes life easier to manage", "NTA. If he doesn't want to take medication he still needs to find better coping mechanisms than laying everything on you.

Enabling his learned helplessness isn\u2019t doing anybody any favors.", "He has become a skilled manipulator.
