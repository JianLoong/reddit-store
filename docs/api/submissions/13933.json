I keep probably a dozen reusable bags in my car and after unloading groceries, I hang the bags I used on a hook at eye level by the door so that I see them (and therefore never forget to grab them) as I\u2019m heading out the door. I also have routines I follow (mostly in the morning and before bed) that help me function and keep my ADHD from running/ruining my life. E.g., no matter what day it is, every morning when I wake up I: make the bed, use the restroom, wash my face, make coffee, do the rest of my morning skincare routine, change out of pjs into my outfit for the day, have coffee and something to eat, and then brush my teeth. I find that having and following my routines is just as (if not more) helpful to me than my medication.

He's doing this to himself and to you. I honestly think this is the time you tell him he gets the medicine or gets it together because when this baby comes, he won't have the luxury of forgetting the baby's diaper needs changing, or where the pacifier is, or when it's food time, and he won't have you to run around as his errand girl either. You need to make a stand now, not later. NTA", "NAH\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGet him in touch with a professional who helps him develop strateges to manage his life better. YOU are NOT his mom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere is such a thing as shopping lists, todo lists, planning your day, ...", "NTA and contrary to what he's saying he is asking for quite a bit. You're picking up a significant amount of mental load for another adult human, and adult humans have a lot of shit going on at any given time. The constant need for vigilance with him is honestly really taxing over time, because it's just another thing on your plate all the time that never goes away.\n\nI have ADHD, I completely understand the issues he's having. I can't tell you how many times I've gone over to my parents' house *expressly* to bring them something from my apartment, only to have forgotten what I was going to bring because I was too focused on remembering I needed to go over there. It's a huge pain in the ass!\n\nBut he needs to make some changes to do what he can to help himself. ADHD, like I just said, is a huge pain in the ass, unmedicated ADHD in my experience is even more difficult (I have to pick up slack for my aging mother who also has unmedicated ADHD so I understand your position) but it doesn't make you helpless, or stupid, or anything like that.\n\nThe problem I'm seeing is that he's not working on developing coping strategies for his memory issues and is instead relying on you to be his memory. What worries me about this is if it's like this now, it's going to be *so* much worse when the baby comes. You're not going to have the bandwidth for being his memory! Since he doesn't seem to have strategies to rely on when you're not there, plus all household routines and stuff will be in total chaos for a while he's going to have an even *worse* time with his memory. So then you're looking at managing yourself, your part of the baby care, his memory, making sure he doesn't forget things for his part of the baby care, etc. You see how it actually comes out to being quite a bit to put on one person?\n\nThe biggest thing I can suggest for right now is work with him to make sure things have a very specific place in the house for him to find. Like the bags for shopping can live by the front door, or near where he puts his shoes on. Grouping activities helps me remember them, which is why I say near the shoes or something like that.\n\nHe should be making lists either by hand or on his phone. I write down literally everything or I will NOT remember it and my ADHD is pretty well managed between my meds and doing research to see what works for me.\n\nIf he forgets items that are easy to retrieve, as much as it sucks, he should start coming up to get them. Having to deal with a consequence I'd rather not deal with sometimes helps me take a minute to be more mindful.\n\nAnother trick I employ often is telling my roommate \"Hey, don't let me forget x.\" He almost never needs to remind me, because I'll remember \"Oh yeah I told him I wanted x.\" Basically like, setting up things that can trigger remembering what was important is what this is all about.\n\nI hope he's open to maybe doing some therapy around it, because it sounds like it does bother him quite a bit to forget things like this (I know it upsets me) and it would improve his quality of life significantly to have that help, and I think it would be a great help for you, too.", "NTA. I have adhd and manage a household by my self so he has no excuse.\n\nArrange grocery pickup or have a smart home device that you can tell to add items to grocery list as soon as they run out. You can pull the list up on your phone and check them off.\n\nSetting reminders on a smart device will alert the device AND text your phone the reminder. You can also snooze the reminder if you can't do it that second.", "I have ADHD and am extremely forgetful as well. It's very hard on my husband, but I do everything in power to minimize the impact it has on him. I also pretty much run the family. I keep a running pickup order open all week that I add things to a I remember them, then submit it Friday night for Saturday pickup. I wake up before everyone else so I can drink my coffee and have time to remember everything that needs to be done. I set reminders on my phone, keep all my keys and bags together, etc. And I go to the therapist and medicate! I had to learn all this the hard way. \nQuite protecting him from the consequences of his actions. He's not going to learn with this system you've set up. \n\nNTA, but let him fail.", "Just make sure you\u2019re still supportive and reassuring about not doing things for him anymore. I understand him feeling upset. There are lots of things that I can\u2019t help and need understanding for. I\u2019ve been shamed in the past for those things as well which compounds my sensitivity to having my shortcomings pointed out. \n\nThat said, I don\u2019t like people treating me like I can\u2019t do anything. If my partner picks up after me, I get upset because I know he\u2019s annoyed and I would have done it if he\u2019d just gently reminded me. That\u2019s just one example but you get the picture. My partner and I have had lots of conversations about how to work with my adhd and his autism and I am always saying \u201cI just need a gentle reminder\u201d. Gentle being the operative word. \n\nIdk how the convo went between you but make sure that you guys are having conversations about how you are going to work with his adhd and a child and what have you. Keep it kind and respectful and remember that a) it\u2019s not your job to make sure things get done and b) his brain is different than most and he needs to feel accepted. Maybe just simply say that you guys need to work together to figure out how you are going to help each other out and what each of you can do to contribute to that. Things like hanging the bags in the door or setting a reminder for you to remind him of important calls. If he doesn\u2019t leave the kitchen area while cooking, he\u2019s less likely to get distracted. The other thing I would recommend is that you ask him what you can do to help him in a way that doesn\u2019t make you be his parent. Let him advocate for himself. \n\nAlso remember that adhd means emotional regulation issues-especially when he\u2019s not taking meds. So that little bit of reassurance is very important. Positive feedback helps too. Even if it feels silly.", "NTA, I'm only a young adult and I have mild ADHD. If I'm cooking something on the stove, I always set a timer to check it. If I have to turn in h.w, I make sure that I set reminders on my phone and I don't just turn them off, I look at them.

Calling my husband to bail me out. If I came home with loose groceries in the car I would not ask him to bring me bags, I\u2019d go get them myself. If I forget something, I go get it. Simple. My responsibility, my learning curve. And dealing with my own shit is what helps reinforce my learning. \n\nMy husband is a saint. He puts up with my flakiness a lot. I don\u2019t need to be adding to that. Your fianc\u00e9 has a right to decide whether to use meds or behavioral strategies or both. But you are doing him no favors by bailing him out.
