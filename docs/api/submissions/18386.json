Don\u2019t tell your parents, maybe he will notice the differences too.", "NTA. You didn't commit to do this forever, and it's not working for you.

Choose the restaurant yourself", "Right? So weird. Whenever I offer to take my parents out, I always pick the restaurant lol. This is some borderline r/choosingbeggars material.\n\nNTA OP. Start taking your family to Burger King lol", "NTA. Your parents are being extremely rude to you. YOU have chose. To graciously take them out to dinner and they are being widely entitled with your money. I would make your brother aware of what they are doing and make sure your brother is aware that your parents think he isn\u2019t doing well financially (which is exactly what they think if they are deciding that he can\u2019t afford to take them to a nice restaurant).

Once? Reasonable. All the time? Hell no.", "NTA \n\nAnd if they continue with this bring Paul into it. This is misogynistic af", "NTA.

He may not be aware of these advantages that are being afforded to him. Hopefully, he'd be appalled at the favoritism. Splitting the bill at any restaurants is the best solution if you still want to take them out at all.", "NTA and clearly they are penalising you for being non-binary. It's like \"he's got a girlfriend and a future family but you will be alone all your life so whatcha got to save for?\". Nasty parent stuff.", "NTA Instead of isolating yourself, just pick the restaurant. Life is too short for all of you to be crying thru full mouths.  How can you escalate a first world dispute, bust up family dinner, when all you have to do is choose the restaurant.  You and your parents sound exhausting.", "NTA if anything it should be the other way around. Paul is 5 years older and has presumably been working for about 5 years longer, giving him more time to amass capital to buy a house in the future.", "Tell your bro that your parents are trying to help him save money to be more attractive since they think he is near his expiration date \ud83d\ude01 and definitely passing his \"best before\" date.\n \ud83d\ude07\nThat is what they said  right?", "NTA. \n\nAh, I remember the days of getting invited to family get togethers and being asked to bring roasted potatoes, the cake for the party, the turkey for Thanksgiving and getting there to see my brother brought some 2 liters and paper plates. \ud83d\ude43", "I like this choice. From now on, you and your brother split the bill when y\u2019all\u2019s go out. This stops your parents from being able to purposefully take advantage of you.", "How about somewhere with a senior discount lol?", "OK, now the routine changes.  \n\nShould you decide to reinstitute the dinners, you select the places where you take your parents when it's your turn.  Period.  Finished.  (\"But you prooooomised!  No take-backsies. You uuuupset us!\"  \"I've changed my mind.  If you prefer I don't take you out if I select the place, I'm happy to end the arrangement altogether.  Your choice.\")\n\nThe places you select should be exactly comparable to the places your parents selected for Paul to take them for the previous dinner.  They have Paul pay for mall food, the next week you take them to a different mall.  (\"Gosh, you chose a mall last week so I thought you'd want mall food.  For variety, I chose a different mall.\")  They pick a food truck for Paul's week, presto, you pick a different food truck for your week.\n\nBlatant favoritism (rooted, I'm afraid, in blatant sexism) is not OK.

SOLVED", "Sounds like your parents want grandkids. \nNAH.", "Talk to Paul, see if he'd be down with the two of you straight up splitting the cost of each dinner out.

I\u2019m so sorry your family sucks. Spend your time and money with people who deserve you", "NTA. Good that you are standing up for the yourself!", "NTA, but stop agreeing to pay for dinner.", "Can you talk to your brother, explain the nonsense your parents are on about, and propose that, from\nnow on, you either go 50/50 for each meal or you are stepping down from family meal time? \nHonestly my sister would have lost her mind if our parents did this to me. He isn\u2019t much of a sibling if he doesn\u2019t side w you on this one.", "NTA. Unless Paul himself has said that he is saving up money for a proposal/ wedding/ baby then I see no rhyme to parents' logic. They have made something that should have been a nice family get-together into a thing that will make everyone feel bad.\n\nDid you talk with your brother? Does he know that your parents are planning his future just because he has a girlfriend? I swear, your parents are wild.", "NTA.\n\nAre your parents scrubs? Why are you and your brother paying for every family meal?\n\nIf you and Paul want to maintain the standard of taking your parents out twice a month and letting them pick where to go, you and Paul should start splitting the cost 50/50 rather than alternating who pays.\n\nAnother option would be to give your parents 2 or 3 places to choose between rather than free reign to choose any restaurant they want.\n\nThe last option, of course, is to stop treating them to dinner every month.\n\n>My parents said that I\u2019m being childish and going back on my words about our arrangement.\n\nYou had no idea they would take advantage of you and display such blatant favoritism. You made an agreement in good faith. They crapped all over it.", "I understand youre upset. \n\nBut maybe a less nuclear option? If you want to keep the relationship with your family.\n\nHow would you feel if you said \"from now on, I will pick restaurant at my weeks\" and religously chose the same place your brother paid for last week? \"I liked the food here, I wanted to try the xx that you were having because it looked so good.\"\n\nOr perhaps you could talk to your brother, see how he feels about this. If he is halfway decent, he will tell your parents to stop this immediately. It is ridiculous of them to treat him like he has no agency.\n\nYour parents are ofc in the wrong. Sadly this is not the only time people become crazy just thinking about and hoping for a possible grandchild.", "NTA. That sucks.", "Once a month and split the check.  NTA", "Your parents remind me of the being who is considered my older sibling (I don't claim her... I say that jokingly but the reality is, when our last surviving parent passes, and everything is settled, I'm going NC). Whenever my parents footed the bill, she ordered the most expensive dish, with drinks to boot.", "You kind of the ah. I agree there shouldn't be favouritism. But I have to say you parents paid for dinner education and the roof over your head until you moved out. Quibbling about paying for fancy dinners when money isn't an issue while they paid for your entire existence. Also as a NB person you are unlikely to start a family so what difference does it make. I think you are having an issue just to have an issue and need to grow up a bit.", "Right?! Like I'm flabbergasted by this. My parents and maternal grandparents used to *fight* over who got to pay. Like grabbing the check before it could hit the table, hand-slapping kinds of fights. (They tipped well and apologized to any startles waitstaff.) Whoever was the most aggressive or the sneakiest won. \n\nI once memorably won when I approached the waitress, explained that I didn't want them fighting and asked her to give me the bill so I could give it to my mother, but I paid it instead. \ud83d\ude08 Parents and grandparents both ended up paying me back but I still won! But they NEVER would have taken advantage of their kids like this, and my family sucked pretty hard.", "The brother should at least have noticed the disparity in the restaurant choice even if he hasn't guessed the reason behind it.", "Yeah, this whole drama sounds *easily* avoidable using either/both of these suggestions.", "As long as your brother isn't an asshole too, this is absolutely the fairest way to start doing things", "Or whoever pays picks the restaurant.", "I would like to know this as well. This whole scenario seems very contrived.", "When you're on the \"winning\" end of a disparity sometimes you don't question it, and sometimes you don't notice it because you figure it may be evening out somewhere else.  Even OP thought there was a bonafide underlying reason at first.", "and make sure YOU wear the crown.", "In such configuration, the logical thing to do for the brother is to budget his turn according to what OP has paid on the previous turn. He perfectly knows his parents don't ask to eat in places in the same range price than OP. Now, perhaps he thinks it is OP who told their parents it was ok to choose expensive places or perhaps he is the golden child and the parents are used to take advantage of OP so the dynamics is not new. But he knows for sure.", "The Golden Corral!", "Maybe OP will update on his profile or by editing here and we will find out."]}
