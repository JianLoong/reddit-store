Or pick the restaurant yourself. This is hella weird ngl.", "INFO: Is there a reason your parents never take turns paying? Why do your parents always pick the restaurant?", "NTA - they are taking advantage of you.", "NTA. Wowza your parents are unfair.

Even if money isn\u2019t an issue for you, it\u2019s definitely just the principle of the whole thing!", "Nta\n\nStart making the rule that whoever pays chooses where y'all eat.", "NTA, if you want to make common ground talk to your brother about this and just start splitting the bill 50/50 with him when u go out", "This \u201cagreement\u201d has morphed into something that is not what you signed up for.

If they don't like it, they can stay home", "NTA wow", "NTA. Have they bothered to tell your brother what they told you? And were right to ask.", "NTA\n\nThey are totally playing favorites.  If you want to keep having the dinner's, when it is your turn next, offer them a choice of 2 or 3 places that you pick.

Burgers, anyone?\" Then take them to your local fast food joint of choice. You pay, then you get to pick and drive. If they don't like it, too bad. Also, make it a point to tell brother that mom and dad are angling to make his gf their daughter-in-law and mother to their future grandkids.

Don\u2019t tell your parents, maybe he will notice the differences too.", "NTA. You didn't commit to do this forever, and it's not working for you. Either the plan needs to change in how the restaurants are chosen (buyer's choice, all agree, etc) or you aren't available any longer.", "NTA but at this point OP if you continue the dinners it should be whoever is paying is picking.", "NTA, sounds like everyone should be paying for themselves. Why are your parents not taking turns paying?  I\u2019d absolutely refuse to pay, though I\u2019d offer to join and pay for yourself.", "YTA for not standing up for yourself!   Choose the restaurant yourself", "Right? So weird. Whenever I offer to take my parents out, I always pick the restaurant lol. This is some borderline r/choosingbeggars material.\n\nNTA OP. Start taking your family to Burger King lol", "NTA. Your parents are being extremely rude to you. YOU have chose. To graciously take them out to dinner and they are being widely entitled with your money. I would make your brother aware of what they are doing and make sure your brother is aware that your parents think he isn\u2019t doing well financially (which is exactly what they think if they are deciding that he can\u2019t afford to take them to a nice restaurant).

Once? Reasonable. All the time? Hell no.", "NTA \n\nAnd if they continue with this bring Paul into it. This is misogynistic af", "NTA.

He may not be aware of these advantages that are being afforded to him. Hopefully, he'd be appalled at the favoritism. Splitting the bill at any restaurants is the best solution if you still want to take them out at all.", "NTA and clearly they are penalising you for being non-binary.

You and your parents sound exhausting.", "NTA if anything it should be the other way around.

From now on, you and your brother split the bill when y\u2019all\u2019s go out.
