If he is halfway decent, he will tell your parents to stop this immediately. It is ridiculous of them to treat him like he has no agency.\n\nYour parents are ofc in the wrong.

I think you are having an issue just to have an issue and need to grow up a bit.", "Right?! Like I'm flabbergasted by this. My parents and maternal grandparents used to *fight* over who got to pay. Like grabbing the check before it could hit the table, hand-slapping kinds of fights. (They tipped well and apologized to any startles waitstaff.) Whoever was the most aggressive or the sneakiest won. \n\nI once memorably won when I approached the waitress, explained that I didn't want them fighting and asked her to give me the bill so I could give it to my mother, but I paid it instead. \ud83d\ude08 Parents and grandparents both ended up paying me back but I still won!

This whole scenario seems very contrived.", "When you're on the \"winning\" end of a disparity sometimes you don't question it, and sometimes you don't notice it because you figure it may be evening out somewhere else.  Even OP thought there was a bonafide underlying reason at first.", "and make sure YOU wear the crown.", "In such configuration, the logical thing to do for the brother is to budget his turn according to what OP has paid on the previous turn. He perfectly knows his parents don't ask to eat in places in the same range price than OP. Now, perhaps he thinks it is OP who told their parents it was ok to choose expensive places or perhaps he is the golden child and the parents are used to take advantage of OP so the dynamics is not new.

Your parents are bizarre for all of this. NTA.", "NTA.  That is just profoundly unfair.  Maybe you could tell your family that there is now a new budget limit.  Either a certain amount every night, or a certain amount every month.  If they blow the budget for an expensive dinner the first week, when time comes around for the next dinner for you to host you can honestly say, \"Welp, we've hit the budget limit already.  See ya next time.\"  \n\nGood luck.  My parents used to do this with me and my brother and finally I confronted them and I was told \"He needs more help than you do.\"  Oh Thanks...", "NTA - if you want to continue this tradition, the person who pays picks the restaurant and everyone is grateful for being treated regardless of the price point. If Paul wants to save money he can, and it's his choice, and it's valid if he does. Likewise, if OP wants to splurge then it's their decision and not something they feel forced into my the parents. \n\nAnd the parents need to stop trying to manipulate their kids' lives via money. How do they know Paul was even saving money under this little scheme? Like, maybe he noticed he had a bit left over at the end of the month and instead of thinking \"Cool! I'll put this in my house fund!\" he thought \"Cool! I'll buy a PS5!\" Plus it's presumptuous to decide Paul has \"more important\" things to spend his money on compared to OP. They don't get to decide that!", "NTA op, but it does sound like communication is the issue here. You both let them choose, they chose based on what they felt was appropriate (even if it is completely wrong), and you both went with it. Now you spotted discrepancies in the way you and your brother are being treated, time to revisit that arrangement. \n\n1. You and brother both choose spots for each other with a cap on how much to spend. \n\n2. Your parents choose the spot as per usual, but you will only pay up to what your brother paid for his turn. \n\n3. You both just go to your parents for dinner on his turn, and split the bill for your turn with your brother. \n\n4. Whatever else works for your family unit that is fair for everyone involved. There are literally tonnes of ways this can go.", "NTA.  Your parent broke the agreement first by this atrocious behavior.  Explain to your brother why you will not be joining any longer.

We paid for my MIL one time and drove her home.  She threw a $20 bill into the car window as we were leaving.", "Honestly same. I\u2019m incredibly confused by parents encouraging their child to spend more money on taking them to dinner. \n\nIn my family it\u2019s always been a fight over the check, and my mother always wins somehow.", "He\u2019s may be spoiled and is enjoying paying less towards the family meal.", "Looks like it was edited to answer. Personally I think everyone should take turns paying/choosing in a situation like this. In my family, my parents would insist on paying for any family outings and would tell us they\u2019re \u201cjust spending your inheritance.\u201d I can understand treating the folks if they are strapped for cash or very frugal, but otherwise a regular outing should be split more evenly.", "No one has ever successfully beaten my parents at \"get the check\". Before my dad passed, he always won, and my mom has taken over the tradition. I've kinda won twice. Once was via pre-dinner negotiation, and then she snuck a gift card in my purse when I wasn't looking. The other was when we ordered pizza, and she sent me with cash to pick it up. I paid and snuck the cash back in her purse. I thought I got away with it, and then I found the cash in my overnight bag when I got home. Someday, I'll win!", "Hahaha my ex FIL does this. He\u2019d zelle us the money whenever we went out to dinner with him and my ex MIL and paid. \n\nI\u2019ve been divorced from their son for years and they still haven\u2019t let me pay once when I go to dinner with them and the kids.", "Only way I have ever successfully paid for dinner is sneaking it to the waitstaff and pretending nothing happened until everyone was done, then announcing \"welp, let's get going, check's paid\" and getting up to go before anyone can protest", "This makes me think of the super sweet Golden Corral BORU post.

It\u2019s time to just tell your brother you\u2019ll each split the meals from now on. They can pick whatever their heart desires each week but it\u2019ll be half you and half your brother paying. Let them know, and watch how quickly they change their habits.", "NTA. The unfairness of this would really bug me, too. You also have a future to start planning towards. \n\nMaybe you should have 3 dinners together a month. Food court dinners when it is you or your brother's turn to pay and fine dining on your parent's turn.", "There are more appropriate ways for your parents to \u201chelp\u201d Paul. Do they think he\u2019s calculating the difference between his payments and yours and putting the difference in a savings account? If the money you spending is not hurting you financially, keep the family time,it\u2019s probably priceless. The high road is yours for the taking\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.", "Oh man! That is some messed up reasoning to be so unfair. How in the world can a caring parent act like this? Good for you for putting your foot down. They're response is enough for me to halt that shenanigans for a good 3 months. How rude.", "NTA. If they're ok going with a cheaper option on Paul's evening, then they can be ok with going with a cheaper option on your evening. It IS wildly unfair. And good on you for not being a doormat.", "NTA", "Yeah, OP needs to stop framing this as \"they let brother pay less\" and frame it as \"they made me pay more\".", "They should flip a coin to see who pays.", "Frankly, I would say that the brother can take on the bills for a few months until it evens out. Also personally I would be very reluctant to treat my parents to dinner again if they treated me like this. The person paying always gets to choose the place they are eating.", "...what?", "I bought my grandma dinner (literally just fast food takeout I brought to her house, not fancy at all) and she tried to pay me back, I said no, and that sneak threw cash into my purse when I wasn't looking! It was way more than dinner, too. My mom told me not to try and out-compete grandma when it comes to feeding people. (I ordered her dinner through door dash a few weeks later and she's still so surprised by the ability to get things delivered that she forgets she \"owes\" me \ud83d\ude08)", "I'm still in shock that my parents let me and hubby pay the bill on the weekend.  It was our eldest son's 21st birthday, and we took out my parents, son's girlfriend and her parents.  We were clear it was our treat.\n\nWe were prepared for a fight from my dad.  He usually won't let us contribute to any meal out.  We thought for sure he was going to try to contribute.  My husband made a point of asking if my dad was going to try to help pay, because my husband really wanted to do this for our son ourselves.\n\nMy dad didn't make any offers.  I'm 50 years old, and finally got treated like a grownup.\n\n(To be clear, we didn't want my dad to pay anything, and we have tried in the past to pay our share.  He normally won't let us pay anything which is why we were ready for a fight.  And he does treat me like a grownup normally, just not in paying for things)", "That's the way my family usually does it.  Others can make suggestions or requests, but the payer makes the choice."]}
