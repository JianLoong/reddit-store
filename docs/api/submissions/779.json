The VP and Treasurer (who had to deal with a multi-million dollar budget for all the clubs) also got partial scholarships for that year as well.   \nIt looks really good on a resume and you do a lot of networking in those positions since you have to go to Alumni events meeting a lot of people with money to burn and donating to the college/ meet with important guest speakers visiting campus etc. If OP's college does something similar I can see why it would be competitive.", "Student campaigns are always messy.

Politics are supposed to be about policies, not winning by coming out on top as the result of looking like the least shittiest person running.", "The winner would be controlling hundreds of thousands of dollars in student activity funds, controlling what activities are funded and how much, and meeting very important people.", "As shitty as it is, this is what politics actually are in real life. They're not about policies: they're more about personality and mud throwing. There is a reason why politicians are known as a special breed of people: even the honest/moral politicians need to know how to play this game, otherwise they won't get elected.", "I didn't encourage it but if you are simply following someone's accounts because they are your opponent and pulling dirty crap like OP's opponent you should be keeping an eye out for rumors and the like.\n\nStalking is Gross and over the top and I'm hoping it was poor wording on OP's part and they aren't legitimately stalking anyone. \n\nIf so they should both be removed from the running.\n\nIf you are keeping your ear to the ground for rumors, libel, whatever dirty tactics that other people are likely to engage in during politics, that feels reasonable to me and more like campaign research. Not stalking.\n\nJust because you shouldn't participate in dirty politics yourself does not mean you should not have situational awareness in order to defend yourself like OP managed to do in this case with the dean.\n\nApologies I did not type paragraphs the first time in order to explain my comment.", "I'm aware, unfortunately. While I understand the need to cover one's own ass and encourage that, I don't think playing dirty to get even is the right course of action for aspiring politicians. It's a race to the bottom and our generation is way too screwed to break out of that cycle, but it's not too late for people 20-30 years down the line to have fair campaigns.", "Maybe I'm misunderstanding the OP's intent because of the word \"stalking\" here, but I do agree with you on those points.\n\nSituational awareness and CYA is fine. Watching someone like a hawk so you can use their private life to your political advantage, not so much. I should have been a bit more charitable and assumed OP was doing it entirely for CYA, and not following the supposed dirty politics trend at their school.", "Eh, I think that's a nice ideal but I don't think this is a generational problem. People who are drawn to politics and succeed are also just the types of people who are necessarily good at these games and enjoy them, and those people are in every generation.", "I can understand your point and I may have been too generous by assuming she wasn't playing dirty as well. Glad we are on the same overall page though."]}
