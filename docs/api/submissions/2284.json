If it gets lost, give him the insurance  money. He\u2019s already blaming you for keeping his stuff so I\u2019m not sure how it gets worse.", "YOU cheated ehy should he care about you?! How entitled are you?", "Why should he care about you anymore when you cheated? How about doing the right thing this time and send the shit back to him so he can be done dealing with you and find someone who won\u2019t cheat on him.", "You cheated on him. And you can make pictures of the stuff you pack.", "Yeah that's what insurance is for \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Why should he care about you?", "That's what tracking and insurance is for babe, what other excuses do you have for not returning his stuff?", "He doesn\u2019t have to care about you to care about his things.. To give it back would be bare minimum, decent human thing to do, and you can\u2019t even manage that. You\u2019re so bitter", "Then just mail the things back. You don't want to get blamed if it goes missing, but his esteem for you is low as heck already so what would the difference be? How does a misunderstanding lead to accidentally cheating on someone anyway?", "Maybe you should have thought of that before you treated him horridly", "Stop using money as an excuse!!!", "Such a inefficient person you are. Also a thief and a cheater", "So did the person you cheat with accidentally end up at your house? \u201cOh no!\u201d How did we end up here naked? What a miscommunication!\u201d", "Or you could mail back the stuff like he asked and said he was willing to cover?? None of that costs you money.", "Pay a friend with a car to take it to the halfway point.", "Mail it then. Get a courier. There's literally apps for this exact kind of thing", "How is it not your fault you didn't bring all his stuff the first hand off? Info: what was this \"miscommunication?\"\n\nYTA", "Sure, you're not stealing the things - maybe 'taking' is the wrong word, but it's still asshole behavior imo. Unless this *really* financially impacts you, then I could understand it and would probably move to e s h.", "Oh wow. You are an even bigger AH then the post shows. Did not realize that could be topped.\nYou both met halfway already and you did not bring all his things....", "It\u2019s not her fault you fell onto another guys D", "But it IS your fault.", "He's paying for it... Why are you being extra difficult? He's not the one that cheated.", "He said he was paying, no?", "He\u2019s covering the cost of shipping\u2026. Shipping insurance is not that expensive\u2026 obviously he\u2019s willing to accept the risk", "It\u2019s literally not.", "I\u2019m sure all that travel he did to see you was cheap though \ud83d\ude44", "are u running out of excuses yet", "And you\u2019re the reason they have to be sent to him in the first place. It\u2019s your fault. But for your cheating they wouldn\u2019t need to be sent. You come off as a very selfish person from this post.", "No it's not", "\u201cHoney I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t know how to express that one day when I wasn\u2019t wearing pants or trousers I tripped and fell onto another man\u2019s \ud83c\udf46\u201d", "Well it is sort of miscommunication, and she should have address that, but this has nothing to do with her cheating", "Were they? I must have missed where she explained that. Is it in the comments somewhere?", "Who\u2019s the guy in the closet?", "But guys... \"There was a miscommunication\"", "Because op was looking for an excuse", "Just general miscommunication. I was never the best at saying how I felt", "For general shipping yes", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 I forgot to add (Ross) to my comment, I was taking the piss", "WE WERE ON A BREAK!", "Ah, so there was no miscommunication then.", "What does this mean?!? I\u2019m literally the meme of the blonde lady trying to do equations over here", "Sounds like there was no communication. Youre just a cheater and now a thief.", "So you didn't tell him how you felt about wanting to fuck someone else.  Quite a \"miscommunication\"", "Thats not miscommunication.  Thats im a dick amd i cheated.", "And how did you feel? Horny? \n\nI'm confused af how the fuck does you not communicating your feelings cause a misunderstanding that leads to someone else dicking you down", "Girl, stop justifying the fact you cheated and give the guy his stuff. \n\nPeople have arguments and misunderstandings in relationships all the time, but the decent ones manage to not fall on someone else's dick as a result.", "You aren\u2019t very good at a lot of things.\nSince you did a handoff and you somehow didn\u2019t manage ti bring all of his stuff with you, it is now on you to get them back to him.  Particularly since you cheating and thus causing the end of your relationship is entirely on you. Stop being even more of an AH than you have been already and send his stuff back. YTA. Take some responsibility for your actions and behaviour.", "And you can't fork out what's left to send it? Jesus!! You're the asshole here for sure", "Consider it payment for being a shitty girlfriend.", "Uh how much is the value of the items being sent back? Some places is it a dollar per 100 of value, others it is a few bucks for the first 100 to 300 and more fees above that. It's surely worth it to do the decent thing and send his stuff back as well as save you traveling, time spent and having to look him in the eye for cheating on him.", "Op of you need more stupid excuses let my know, I have plenty!", "I'm sure you could collect gutter change on the way to the post office to cover insurance", "Just insure it. You cheated on him and only took him some of his stuff when you met halfway. You have no ground to stand on. He pays shipping, you pay insurance. And then let the man get on with his life. You\u2019re being petty and selfish.", "LOL!!! Yeah I remember that episode...", "It means she cheated because she wanted to, and is pretending it was all a misunderstanding and that he shouldn't be mad that she's trying to steal his shit"]}
