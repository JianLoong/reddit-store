You're right that this is not a big issue", "Calling me a pervert for respecting my stepchild\u2019s autonomy would change my marriage forever.

That is a big insult / accusation to throw at someone you have been with for 12 years. You need to have a very good discussion about that. \n\nDepending on if Anna sees you as her father or not has a huge bearing on whether you were entitled to order her to change her clothing anyway. A step parent telling me what to do at age 14 would have got me doing the opposite or starting an argument. My actual parent, I would have just done it quietly once I was away from them.", "NTA My daughter is 12 and goes to Catholic school. Just like I did in Catholic school, she rolls her skirt. Usually has the sense to do it after I drop her off. Not a big deal IMO.  Wife needs to pick battles carefully with a teen. And calling you a perv is too far IMO.", "What in the actual fuck? I\u2019d be rethinking my marriage if my spouse called me a pervert over something like this. NTA", "NTA\n\nYou're in a no win situation here mate.", "NTA - it\u2019s normal teen behavior, and if you had brought it up she probably still would\u2019ve been questioning why you were paying attention to her daughters skirt. Loose/loose situation here, your wife is overreacting.", "Damned if you do, damned if you don\u2019t. If you had have commented they would have come for you for sexualising a child. Shut your mouth and refuse to engage with the argument any further. Anything you say will lead to trouble. NTA", "NTA \n\nYour wife is concerned because she is probably worried about Anna getting negative attention. Calling you a pervert was uncalled for and very uncool though, so she's TA for that.\n\nYou on the other hand were being respectful of the fact that Anna is her own person and it's weird for grown men to comment on teenage girls' skirts.", "NTA\n\nYou say something about the skirt and it might be seen as controlling - you don't say anything about the skirt and you're a pervert? That's a stretch. There's no winning here.", "NTA\n\nI also just thought that was standard practice for young girls who wear uniforms. I've never lived in a place where uniforms are a thing but i have seen movies and I'm pretty sure that's just what kids do. \n\nI probably would have said something because they should at least be waiting until they're away from parents. \n\nBut you should have said that you just didn't notice. Or that you just thought that was what kids do. Because I'm pretty sure it is just what kids do.", "NTA. Hopefully she didn\u2019t call you that in front of your step daughter. The last thing a girl that age needs is to be worried about a parental figure like that.", "NTA you didn't see it as a problem just normal teen behavior not sure how you not really paying attention to this makes you a pervert.  Kinda the opposite you didn't see it as sexual at all,  just normal", "A pervert? She's totally out of line with that comment. Honestly, I think the length of her skirt is between Anna and the school. Why should you be policing it? Your wife would prefer you monitor the amount of thigh her daughter is showing?  NTA", "NTA. I went to private schools in the U.S AND rolling skirts is super common here as well", ">During the car ride, Kim yelled at Anna for the length of her skirt and told her to roll it down.\n\nWhen you say she yelled, did she really yell? If yes, what the heck is wrong with her? I don't think it's that complicated to nicely ask her why her skirt is so short. And the moment your kid say \"dad knows about it and say nothing\", then ok, drop the subject. But yelling?\n\nNTA. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Maybe it's weird for her but if it's pretty normal in Australia, then she have to get over it instead of trying to blame you.\n\nEdit: spelling lol", "You should be addressing the schools wierd ass rules", "NTA. You aren't a pervert because you aren't sexualizing your stepdaughter. She also hasn't gotten in trouble at school for it. Or at least the school has not contacted her parent about it. So she doesn't seem to be breaking the rules.", "NTA. Wife needs to chill out and let the school deal with it if they have an issue. If they don\u2019t then it\u2019s obviously not that bad.", "NTA and I would be pissed at your partners assumption that you didnt say anything because you were somehow getting off on it.", "NTA.  Anna isn't your daughter, you don't really have much place in disciplining her. Plus, it is probably a wise move to pretend not to notice the skirt length. \n\nKind of strange how fashion works though. My wife also went to a school with a uniform when she was that age. But, at that time, the fashion was to wear the skirt as LONG as possible.  Girls were told by teachers to shorten their skirts or get punished!\n\nPlus Anna is using this as a wedge to get between you and Kim.  Typical teenage behavior. You and Kim need to have a chat about how to stay united in the face of teen angst and rebelliousness.", "NTA. If the school hasn't said anything about it, why would you? \n\nShe would have likely called you a pervert if you did bring it up so I think you were damned either way. Reassess your relationship with your wife though, she obviously has some issue with her view of men or her own self-worth.", "Nta. I don't life in America and in my country roll the skirt is pretty common in girls.", "NTA. Why is she body shaming your daughter? And scolding you for allowing your daughter to have bodily autonomy? She\u2019s just plain wrong.\n\nMy mum paid to have my school kilt hemmed when I was in high school! I used to get in trouble all the time and the VPs were incredulous when I told them my mum paid to have it tailored short.", "NTA\n1. It's your stepdaughter, which means it's your wife's responsibility to address that \n2. Had you called it out before, you would have been \"body shaming\", so there really was no win for you either way.", "ESH\n\nPersonally, I would not let my daughter go to school with a rolled up skirt. I live in the UK and all schools here require children to wear uniforms to school \n\nI wouldn\u2019t want her going to school like that in case someone could see up it, kids that age do it to fit in with the crowd so she wouldn\u2019t realise \n\nHowever, your wife calling you a pervert is out of line. There is no need for name calling like that and she should have just sat down with you like an adult and had a conversation about it and how you are going to deal with the issue in a calm way", "NTA but you're right, you probably should have mentioned it to your Wife, whether it's normal or not.", "Skirt should be to your fingertips. Every nun knows that.", "NTA tell Kim yoh didn't notice the skirt because you are not a pervert and you weren't looking at your step daughter's legs.\n\nTell your step daughter (together) to stop trying to play you and her mum against each other.  It's one of the teenagers main tactics.  Your wife fell for it.", "If you didn\u2019t want to say something to your stepdaughter then you should\u2019ve at least tell your wife about it.

My country also has uniforms and only the religious girls did not roll up their skirts. Our sport skirts were indecently sort tbh. Our main uniform was a box split skirt that was difficult to roll but by god did we do it. It wasn\u2019t as short as the sport skirts but it was definitely shorter than allowed.", "Yep. The reasonable assumption would be that OP chose to mind his own business\u2026 how does that make him a pervert?", "Agreed", "It is, at least here in Australia.

If it\u2019s a public school the school usually won\u2019t care about the skirt length (private schools are a lot stricter about uniforms)."]}
