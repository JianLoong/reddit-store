We live in Australia, where most schools have uniforms, but Kim, being American, didn't have a uniform growing up. Recently, my stepdaughter Anna 14f has been rolling up her school skirt.\n\nWhen I was in school, it was common for girls to roll up their skirts, and even my daughter 22f did it during high school. Since Kim leaves for work earlier than I do, I usually drop Anna off at school. Anna is asleep when Kim leaves most mornings. Over the past month, I've noticed that Anna's skirt has been getting shorter.\n\nYesterday, I had to go into work early, so Kim agreed to drop Anna off at school. During the car ride, Kim yelled at Anna for the length of her skirt and told her to roll it down. Anna mentioned that I had seen her skirt before and never said anything.\n\nKim is now extremely upset with me and has accused me of being a pervert. In hindsight, maybe I should've told Kim about Anna's skirt, but I didn't see it as a big issue as it is pretty normal here, also I wasn't really sure how to bring it up.\n\neta- I only say the rolled skirt is 'normal' as my older kid did it, and I have had the same argument with her. It gets hot, and while boys have the option of wearing shorts, girls don't so I understand she could be rolling her skirt due to the heat. I am a dad to Anna, but I leave Kim to parent bigger decisions with Anna. I have spoke to Kim about the pervert comment, it upset me and made me uncomfortable. I didn't address it as I didn't think it was related to the post. She said it was a heat of the moment thing, but if she felt that way why would she leave me alone with her daughter? I don't want to be around Anna alone anymore, who doesn't know we are currently in a fight.

I'm picking up on sensitive red flags for your wife regarding her own projections.\n\nIn my line of work I see these things manifest when a caregiver has experienced sexual trauma themselves or has deeply internalized views that women's bodies are inherently sexual- because parents teach to their kids (or we learn passively) that girls/women are \"asking for it\" and generally internalize the view that young girls bodies need to be monitored and controlled while young boys dont.\n\nI have some thoughts to offer below if it's helpful for you.\n\nIf you're open to it (willing to dig in the trenches with your partner and do emotional labor) I might invite her into a conversation about values and her experiences- there is something deep down that is urging her to \"safeguard\" her daughter from being sexualized while unintentionally sexualizing her in the process and lashed out stating you are a pervert for not reacting to a pretty neutral and normal thing teenagers do. Or, she has something driving her concerns around rule following and social consequences... to the point that she is lashing out at her loved ones and using hurtful/accusatory rhetoric. If you can understand where these feelings are coming from, that will help you navigate the conversation around your daughter.\n\nHer concern has nothing to do with you or even your daughters skirt rolling.... and the concern will continue to come up in various ways until the root trauma/internalized stuff is addressed.

I rolled up my school uniform skirt in 1992, everyone did it, it was fashion. \nWife needs to chill.", "NTA - you didn\u2019t sexualise your daughters outfit. How tf does that make you a pervert lol.\n\nAlso, as an aussie, rolling of skirt has been done for yeaaaars. If it\u2019s an issue the school will address it.", "NTA. Her comment was way out of line.  \nRolling skirts up is common in American schools with uniforms too. One of my friends used to mark on her legs with marker to see how high she could get it before being talked to", "NTA, the pervert comment would deeply disturb me. That\u2019s really what her first thought it? my god.", "NTA man. girls do this here in england as well and it is very hot right now so its understandable. tbh it would be far more concerning if you payed more attention to her skirt length", "NTA. I (female) also went to a school with uniforms, and rolling skirts is super common. If you told her to roll it down, she'd just roll it up again once she got to school. Unless she is getting in trouble at school due to it, there's no reason to pester her about skirt length.", "NTA. \n\nThe pervert comment was inappropriate and indicates something more is going on with Kim. Whatever that may be, I have zero clue.\n\nAlso because uniforms are obnoxious imo, but I teach at a public school in Detroit, MI, and understand that this topic is one that comes with cultural/situational biases. I struggle with this one, because I can\u2019t deny the potential benefits, but can\u2019t feel comfortable with policing children\u2019s bodies/attire. I hated it as a kid/teen, and don\u2019t don\u2019t want to have to do it to anyone else.", "NTA. The comment your wife made was totally uncalled for. You never sexualized your stepdaughter and her mom accusing you of that is going to have a lasting impact.", "NTA.\n\nMaybe as it got shorter and shorter should have discussed it with her mother. But you were honestly just letting a teenager be a teenager and you'd dealt with your daughter in the past and knew he reasons. \n\nThere was no reason for you to be called a pervert.", "NTA, we\u2019ve seen a ton of stepdad postings where they were seen as inappropriately controlling or hung up on a daughter\u2019s appearance. You made the right call here. \n\nThe school will enforce the rule if she goes too far.", "Pretty sure the weather never played into the decision to roll our skirts up in aus. Especially the winter skirts", "As a fellow Aussie, everyone rolls their skirts. The rules always say knee length but anyone who does wear them that way is seen as strange because the skirts are usually thick and it is hot as hell here most of the time. In winter I know some girls who would wear theirs at full length because it was cold but most others, including myself, just put tights on underneath. \n\nVery much NTA and I\u2019m sorry that you had to deal with that comment from your wife.", "NTA\n\nIt\u2019s a lose lose situation because if you say anything you are overstepping and if you don\u2019t you are not taking responsibility.\n\nThe girls who didn\u2019t roll up their uniform shirts (and I include myself in that group) were definitely in the minority and often suspect.", "NTA\n\nYou have a daughter of your own and so you know the struggles. What she said is not ok.", "NTA. It doesn\u2019t matter what you tell her, as soon as you are out of sight, she would be rolling it back up anyway. You might as well just let it go and maintain the trust she has with you.", "O00 pillow", "Not necessarily an asshole, but as a catholic school teacher, help us out, and tell her to unroll her skirt.", "It\u2019s interesting that I didn\u2019t find any comments from Japan about school uniforms and if they think the uniform skirts are too short.", "NTA \n\nI went to catholic school and every single girl did this and we rolled them back down before the ruler to see how short they were came around HahHaha", "NTA. I rolled up my school skirt 30 years ago my parents never said anything as they could claim ignorance if I got caught (she did it when she got to school). Generally the school didn\u2019t care as long  as we didn\u2019t roll it too high. \n\nThe pervert comment is weird.", "Ouch! Definitely NTA. Kim needs a parenting lesson. The way she said those things is wrong and mean. And even in the heat of the moment, it's 100% uncalled for. You maintained your boundaries and didn't say anything to your stepdaughter. You also explained it's because you've had a similar experience in the past and learnt from it. IT'S JUST A PHASE!! honestly idk why Kim was even upset", "NTA, but you should have mentioned it to your wife, especially if she generally wants your daughter to dress modestly or you noticed but didn\u2019t know how to bring it up. I\u2019m sorry she made you feel uncomfortable, that\u2019s understandable and really sucks.", "NTA. SHe is lashing out and fighting to win", "Maybe unresolved trauma, maybe just a low blow as well.", "NTA. I went to Catholic grade school in the US and once girls hit middle school, it was the norm", "I second this! Absolutely atrocious for her to call OP a pervert. He\u2019s been her dad since she was 2!", "My first thought was not jealousy but nervous overprotectiveness, but that is because I have issues from my own childhood and tend to be very defensive and overprotective of the kids in my life. But Kim calling him a pervert definitely feels like a much larger issue than a rolled up skirt.", "yep. at the very least make her drive her own daughter to school from now on, this was extremely out of line. nta.", "It's weird. Like I went to school in Florida and went to school with both uniforms and regular dress code. At worst, you might face a teacher telling you to fix your bottoms so it's longer than the fingertips. \n\nHowever - no one in my HS wore skirts - just shorts. And shorts longer than the fingertips for girls that are also stylish don't exist in FL. It's all pretty decently short shorts. No one ever got dress coded. Parents though? Super weird about it when they can't handle their kids growing into adults", "We wore uniforms at my school growing up. Skirt length was regulated.\n\nI never, ever saw a male teacher enforce it. Because it would be fuckin weird to even point it out. You did the right thing here.\n\n\nNTA.", "That one sentence has probably destroyed his trust with her", "Yes I agree. OP and his wife have some serious talking to do in order to move on from this comment: it\u2019s a pretty big deal.\n\nPersonally I\u2019d\u2019ve thought it is more perverted to notice and sexualise a young girl\u2019s skirt length than not.\n\nNTA", "I'd expect my partner to leave me in a heartbeat if I ever made that kind of comment. Its so messed up and it also shows how badly the wife thinks of OP.", "Same. Honestly, as soon as I read that, I thought \"divorce\".", "Right- I thought most teen girls who wear uniforms to school rolled up their skirts to make them shorter.", "NTA and the pervert comment was rude and uncalled for", "Nope. We would wear them as short as we want EVEN in peak winter. Sometimes we would wear tights. It is always a strange sight. A shirt, jumper and a blazer on top. Followed by a short skirt and school shoes (with regular school socks, don\u2019t sexualise this please). All adults knew kids don\u2019t feel cold.", "Bro she's 14 wtf man", "At a non-religious girls' school and our male PE teacher would make us line up and bend over so he could check whether our skirt was too short. PervsAreUs,", "NTA I had a g/f who went to an all girls catholic school in the US and she said it was a game with them to roll the skirts to see who could get them the highest before the nun/teachers complained. \n\nthis is what school girls have been doing for decades and mom just found out.", "Ha, also Irish! We rolled. The only school in our city that didn\u2019t had ankle length plaid skirt that weren\u2019t full pleated kilt but the fold over and pin sort.\n\nSo they adopted the trend for black school shoes by Kickers with the big block heel which as it was the 90s turned into basically half the girls in shoes chunkier than anything the Spice Girls could muster. They flashed ankle and were determined enough to rebel, I would not have been shocked if mini stepladders became all the rage.\n\nI mean what was the point of school uniform if not to teach children how far you can push rules? Our uniform code was six pages long and everything was the itchiest wool possible. It\u2019s just teaching critical thinking really :)", "Not only did he mind his business he also saw something super common in his life\u2026 to him it\u2019s like wearing a coat in winter or a tshirt in summer \n\nthe pervert comment was uncalled for \u2026 if he had for a second or two done something like that Anna would notice", "I'm not a fan of them in that they do enforce gender norms, I mean, let the girls wear pants if they want, especially during the winter.  I recall part of the argument for school uniforms is that it levels the playing field in terms of your obvious economic background.\n\ngranted that it probably doesn't do much of that at all anymore considering all the other ways kids can show off.  cell phones I guess and other electronics you can have in your bag, or even your bag is used as a flex.", "As a public schooled American who has never had to wear a uniform... are uniform skirts usually a really unflattering length or something? I can't imagine I would have cared enough to do weird shit with the waistband.", "Same. Skirt was bulky so you could tell from a mile away that a skirt was rolled because the rolled part would show through the structure of the shirt. We rolled them anyway. \n\nIt\u2019s also an unspoken thing but as we got older and went from 11/12 to 17/18 y o, we would start wearing our skirts from when we were 11/12. They were short and tight cause we\u2019d grown obviously. There would be no reason to roll it", "In highschool (Catholic with nuns) we had a dress code but no uniforms. The nuns would give a pointed \"Girls if you have to hold you skirt while you go up the stairs its too short\" or \"No spaghetti straps!\".  Luckily the rulers were for measuring things and not slapping. They were nice nuns and mostly we all preferred jeans. My parents grew up with the mean nuns. It was also all girls so male teachers were used to female issues since going down the halls you would here often enough \"Does anyone have a tampon/pad?\" lol. They were also protective of us when we went on field trips via public busses. Don't mess with their students/girls. haha.", "Non-Catholic Grammar and yep, skirts were rolled up, socks were pushed down, and teachers made you reverse that a lot.", "Same here! Went to a Catholic school in the US where the old nuns would walk past us in the hall and pull our skirts as they went by to unroll them. The girls that DIDNT try to get away with rolling their skirts were considered \u201cweird\u201d", "Went to Catholic school as well. We all rolled our skirts.", "Catholic school survivor here also, can confirm everyone rolling their skirts. Also, it was well known that seniors, or any girl who looked like she'd experienced a significant growth spurt, was exempt from getting her skirt measured. In the 90's that stupid skirt cost $75. Most of us bought one or maybe two when we were freshmen and were not about to shell out another $75 just to make it through senior year.", "All girls school. We rolled our skirts up too. They used to make us kneel on the floor to see if our skirts touched the floor and if they didn\u2019t you\u2019d get an ORDER MARK. If we could only have worn shorts or trousers\u2026", "Small correction, Britney in the school uniform was the \"Baby One More Time\" video, \"Oops! I Did It Again\" was the red body suit.", "You sexualize the uniform, there is nothing inherently sexual about a skirt.", "The cause and effect goes the other way. *Because* they were associated with repression, they became sexualized, because people get off on taboo.", "Oh my god those fucking pinafore skirts are an actual war crime, my primary school had them and they were awful. I was so glad my secondary school had a grey box pleat!", "I think for a lot of people it's a form of rebellion against being forced to wear a constricting uniform a certain way. We used to get pulled from classes at random and made to kneel on the floor, if our skirts weren't touching the ground then off to the office you go.", "Typically uniform skirts are made super long, both for modesty and to allow a wider range of heights to wear them\u2014 if you hit your growth spurt, in theory it can still be worn. But they\u2019re not flattering or cute, from the perspective of someone who wore them for K-12 and rolled her skirt whenever she could get away with it. \nIt was also common for girls in my high school to get them hemmed, which looked a lot better\u2014 rolling kilts tends to make them bunch up weird\u2014 but I think it was pretty expensive to have done.", "I went to catholic school and yes girls would roll them up from knew length to mid thigh. Not everyone but a lot.", "Went to an American Catholic school - ours were middle of knee length. We all mastered the art of rolling our skirts up and \"dusting our skirt off\" when the stricter nuns were coming to roll them down again. We had the option of pants too, but the cut was horrible and I genuinely don't believe a single person fit properly into them.", "I once bought a kids\u2019 plus size skirt in early high school (with my mom\u2019s approval). I was like 5\u20192\u201d at the time so it\u2019s not like it was indecently short, just slightly above the knee rather than past it.", "Half the girls at my school cut the shorts out of the skirts", "Same and same. Brings back memories!", "We did it in the 60's when mini skirts came in.   Girls in my all girls school looked like they had lifebelts round their waist, so much material was rolled up there.  Staff would make us kneel on the floor and measure the hems.", "I remember a very hot summer day back when I was a young teen. I was at a friend's house and we were both putting on skirts we just got and I remember I was worried about this exact thing, that men would look at me, that it would somehow be too \"slutty\" and I would provoke them to look. Like it's somehow my responsibility. My family never used phrases like those you mentioned and they weren't particular strict about clothing either.\nStill I had this mindset. I feel like it's even society at this point. Which is really sad actually..\nAnd I still remember my friends mom telling me \"there is a heatwave outside, it's freaking hot.. These are exactly the days short skirts are for!!\" \nIt was a lightbulb moment for me", "I'm 42 and my mom still freaks the hell out if I wear a tank top around my dad. I just tell her to make it warmer in her damn house then.", "That's dehumanizing as hell", "Different Canadian but before my Catholic school days when I was still in public, I didn\u2019t do it often but I did wear pyjamas sometimes. Usually when my parents didn\u2019t do laundry (I wasn\u2019t allowed to do my own) and I didn\u2019t have anything else to wear", "\ud83d\ude36 im sorry.", "Haha. Life, uh, finds a way.", "Ughhh, that's so disgusting. Idk why anyone would even think of a kid like that. If they are, they shouldn't be working with kids."]}
