We live in Australia, where most schools have uniforms, but Kim, being American, didn't have a uniform growing up. Recently, my stepdaughter Anna 14f has been rolling up her school skirt.\n\nWhen I was in school, it was common for girls to roll up their skirts, and even my daughter 22f did it during high school. Since Kim leaves for work earlier than I do, I usually drop Anna off at school. Anna is asleep when Kim leaves most mornings. Over the past month, I've noticed that Anna's skirt has been getting shorter.\n\nYesterday, I had to go into work early, so Kim agreed to drop Anna off at school. During the car ride, Kim yelled at Anna for the length of her skirt and told her to roll it down. Anna mentioned that I had seen her skirt before and never said anything.\n\nKim is now extremely upset with me and has accused me of being a pervert. In hindsight, maybe I should've told Kim about Anna's skirt, but I didn't see it as a big issue as it is pretty normal here, also I wasn't really sure how to bring it up.\n\neta- I only say the rolled skirt is 'normal' as my older kid did it, and I have had the same argument with her. It gets hot, and while boys have the option of wearing shorts, girls don't so I understand she could be rolling her skirt due to the heat. I am a dad to Anna, but I leave Kim to parent bigger decisions with Anna. I have spoke to Kim about the pervert comment, it upset me and made me uncomfortable. I didn't address it as I didn't think it was related to the post. She said it was a heat of the moment thing, but if she felt that way why would she leave me alone with her daughter? I don't want to be around Anna alone anymore, who doesn't know we are currently in a fight.

I'm picking up on sensitive red flags for your wife regarding her own projections.\n\nIn my line of work I see these things manifest when a caregiver has experienced sexual trauma themselves or has deeply internalized views that women's bodies are inherently sexual- because parents teach to their kids (or we learn passively) that girls/women are \"asking for it\" and generally internalize the view that young girls bodies need to be monitored and controlled while young boys dont.\n\nI have some thoughts to offer below if it's helpful for you.\n\nIf you're open to it (willing to dig in the trenches with your partner and do emotional labor) I might invite her into a conversation about values and her experiences- there is something deep down that is urging her to \"safeguard\" her daughter from being sexualized while unintentionally sexualizing her in the process and lashed out stating you are a pervert for not reacting to a pretty neutral and normal thing teenagers do. Or, she has something driving her concerns around rule following and social consequences... to the point that she is lashing out at her loved ones and using hurtful/accusatory rhetoric. If you can understand where these feelings are coming from, that will help you navigate the conversation around your daughter.\n\nHer concern has nothing to do with you or even your daughters skirt rolling.... and the concern will continue to come up in various ways until the root trauma/internalized stuff is addressed.

Getting that touching less skin isn't necessarily trying to look sexy. (For the record, it makes the waist look lumpy, so not exactly attractive anyhow.) For a lot of kids it's just a practical measure to get the darned thing out of the way. It's also a way to exert a tiny bit of control over their own attire when the whole point of uniforms is to take away that autonomy.
