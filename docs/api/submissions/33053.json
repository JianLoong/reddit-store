I go to the bathroom after \u201cme time\u201d, I wipe front to back, my hands are clean, I wash regularly with unscented soap and still I find myself with a UTI around I\u2019d say 7-8 times a year.  \n\nMy parents think I\u2019m \u201ceither getting them from sleeping around or from wiping wrong\u201d and now when I get UTIs they get mad at me and punish me for it.

And speaking as someone who's had several UTIs and a couple of kidney infections, I feel for you. Sometimes you can do everything right and that stuff just keeps coming back. You should find a nephrologist and/or an urologist to find out WHY you keep getting sick. It could be a bacteria that wasn't properly eliminated the first time around (by using the wrong antibiotics that just \"put it to sleep\" instead of killing it), could be a genetic condition, could be related to kidney stones, there are a million reasons why you could be going through them and a lot of them can't be blamed on you. You felt unsafe going to the doctor to seek treatment because of how they behaved last time. This infection is on them and no one else. I hope you feel better soon!", "NTA, your parents are definitely being assholes. They shouldn\u2019t be punishing you for medical reasons. UTIs can happen for many different reasons and some people are just more susceptible to them. One of my aunts would get them like once a month. Sorry you are going through that. I wish you luck.", "NTA and there are so many reasons for UTI's that have absolutely nothing to do with which way you wipe or sexual activity.  There's a urologist who posts on Twitter and she just posted to that effect; some people are just prone to UTI's, and there's a ton of ignorance about it, including the idea that which way you wipe has something to do with whether or not you get a UTI.  I'm sorry your parents are choosing to remain ignorant instead of taking you to see a urologist and then another one to get a second opinion.  They're using you as a nanny and not taking care of you responsibly as their child.  Is there a school counselor you could talk to about this?  You need an advocate you will get your parents to snap out of whatever ignorant fog they've chosen to blow around their child's chronic illness instead of taking care of you as they should.", "Nta and I am sorry, your parents are being terrible.  Could you talk to a school nurse to help convince your parents this isn't your fault?", "NTA, ur parents created this situation by punishing when they should be supporting. U are sick and they are talking about accountability...  srry but ur parents sucks.", "NTA. This is medical neglect - also happened lots to me in my teen years, thanks mom and dad - and you absolutely need ongoing medical care from a gyno to take care of it. Chronic UTIs of that frequency could be caused by a number of serious conditions.", "This is medical abuse on your parent's part.  Child protective services can help you. Their number is just a search away", "NTA at all. I'm immunocompromised and antibiotic resistant to most, and allergic to some others and have been suffering from a kidney infection which has never left me for nearly a decade. It is hugely debilitating, horrific and I've been on prescription pain relief ever since just to function. But I am a 32 year old adult. You are a minor. Your parents have a responsibility to ensure your medical needs are addressed urgently. Blaming you for something outside your control is medical abuse. Making you babysit your siblings as a child yourself is parentification, which again, is abuse.  Please tell a trusted adult at school what's happening... they can get professionals involved to help you. Before this kidney infection leads to kidney failure and/or sepsis...", "NTA. Take accountability for what even?! You DID go and get medical attention. You DID attempt to inform them earlier on. You DID try to get help before it got so serious, and frankly it  was THEIR behaviour that resulted in you having to wait so long to get help.\n\"Take accountability\" It seems we're seeing that classic old school mentality of \"do as I say, not as I do\" on clear display here since neither of your parents appear to be taking accountability for their actions and yet had the audacity to say this to you.", "NTA", "NTA. \nUnsolicited advice: Not a doc, but as someone who had chronic UTIs as a teen, make sure you are using cotton undies, go commando at bed if possible, absolutely no thongs, and if you use tampons, start cutting the strings short so no moisture can wick up them.", "Remind them that they chose to abuse you with medical neglect, and it's their fault for treating health issues like a moral failing.", "NTA.  \"My parents think I\u2019m \u201ceither getting them from sleeping around or from wiping wrong\u201d and now when I get UTIs they get mad at me and punish me for it.

Keep advocating for yourself!", "NTA of course! What your parents are doing is abusive.", "Weird in your other comment you said you\u2019re 18.  What\u2019s up with that?", "My mother has to be on maintenance antibiotics for frequent UTIs.  And the doctor has told her that he believes the reason this happens to her is the distance between her vagina and rectum is less than average.

Why would you be grounded for a medical problem? It is beyond my comprehension as a human being to understand what their problem is. What I can say is these are not the actions of a good parent. When they get old and have medical issues, scream \u201c you\u2019re grounded\u201d and tell them they brought it on themselves. It\u2019s a good time to go for the jugular, in a metaphorical way.", "That\u2019s grounds for calling CPS.", "NTA, unfortunately, dealing with some doctors isn't much better. Keep pushing to get the issue resolved.\n\nThis is exactly why closing Planned Parenthood locations is stupid. People need basic care.", "NTA omg I want to cry for you. Your parents have failed you greatly.", "NTA. I had something similar when I was in uni.\n\nTurns out wearing pants made of acrylic material is not a good idea. Also you need the right antibiotics to murder that thing dead.\n\nTry to wear pants in high cotton content (jeans should be fine) and as another poster already mentioned, cotton undies. Anything plastic is making this worse if not outright causing it.", "NTA - My daughter had a similar problem. Every time she turned around she was getting UTI\u2019s turned out it was the toilet paper giving her the UTI\u2019s it was trial and error but we found 3 she could use without problems. She\u2019s grown but the only other UTI\u2019s she got she was pregnant", "NTA. Your parents are nuts. I got UTIs from total random things, i.e. sitting in cold floors, using the wrong detergent or just because. I bought some d mannose capsules from amazon and take them whenever I feel the slightest tingeling. No more UTIs for me!\n\nTell your parents they need to stop to make assumptions and to get you some help for totally normal things that are not your fault.", "NTA. As a frequent sufferer of UTIs due to sports, I know sometimes you are doing EVERYTHING right and still there's just a lot of irritation, which leads to more infection.\n\nThere may be some additional things that can help -- double voiding, cotton underwear, ensuring you \"air things out\" when you sleep, changing the soap or even just using water occasionally (some unscented soap can still cause irritation and you might even be too clean!), changing your detergent / using unscented or natural detergent for your undergarments, really making it a point to pee AND shower after any sexual contact, always changing your underwear after exercise to a fresh pair -- but chances are you're doing most of this, and need the expertise of a urologist to ensure there's not some other factor causing the UTIs. And even if you eventually figure out a \"culprit,\" you are certainly not disobedient or \"bad\" for having a health condition that is extremely common in women and also extremely difficult to combat.\n\nPlease find a urologist and bring your parents along if need be, so they can hear from a professional that this is NOT something you are choosing for yourself! Also, make sure your UTIs are being urine sampled to make sure the infections are actually cleared when you take antibiotics, as antibiotic resistance to first-line antibiotics is quite common and you may need another course of a different medication.\n\nAlso, look into a PCP who will be willing to give you a prophylactic antibiotics Rx (e.g., nitrofurantoin) for when you are sexually active, sweating a lot, or other high-potential-UTI times. And some doctors will be willing to give you an additional 5- or 7-day course of antibiotics for your next UTI, along with phenazopyridine to ease immediate symptoms until you can see a doctor. Keep these things around as your emergency stash.", "I love d-mannose for mine", "OP ought to send a text or email saying since you care about my health, next time I am in pain I'll go to the hospital and let you know if I will be late to curfew.\n\nAnd if they respond OP is still responsible for making curfew even if they're genuinely sick, OP has evidence parebts don't have her best interests in mind.\n\nExhibit A why health issues are better addressed sooner: \nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/hueojs/aita_for_telling_my_mother_that_its_her_own_fault/", "I second the cotton undies!\n\nI'm less excited about going commando in bed, but if that helps, go for it!\n\nAlso try not to wear acrylic/plastic pants and leggings.
