It was wonderful, and for a while I truly experienced the \"marriage euphoria\". We did butt heads sometimes but that was mostly due to our different personalities, I think. \n\nAnyway, a few days ago as we were going on a walk, she asked me if I wanted to combine all of our banking accounts so we can share one. Currently, we have our own seperate accounts and 1 extra shared account to pay all the bills with. I agreed to put more money on it than her since I earn more. I have always been generous with my money towards her, always treated her with gifts and above all, I offered financial stability. However, even though we recently got married, I like having my own banking account because it grants me some autonomy, and I am simply used to it. \n\nShe did not agree with it, nor did her parents. They all claimed I was being an idiot for not wanting 1 account, and apparently I hurt her feelings for keeping my own account. \nI have no secrets for her, but they assume I do now due to my reluctance. For some reason, she is always low on money (whilst having a job) but I always have money in the bank. I am in the military and honestly, I really dont need the extra added stress just because they think I am committing treason (apparently?)\nHer father made me out to be too old school and controlling after I adamantly stated I wanted to keep seperate accounts. Her mother said her daughter is doomed if I am away for a mission or whatever, without her having access to my money. In an angry fit (and while they were ganging up on me) my wife said that if I dont want to use 1 account with her, she cant remain married to me...seems overly dramatic to me? \n\nAm I the asshole? I am asking because I truly love her, but my friends have all said this is a HUGE red flag. Heck, even my mother is outraged about this. If you want more context, by all means feel free to ask! There are definitely more details to the story, but I dont want to oversaturate this part\n\nEdit: I never expected so many honest responses so quickly!

When my cousin found out, she wasn't happy and also worried.  They had a lot of conversations. Made a household budget and individual ones. To pay the debt down sooner, she offered to pay a higher portion of the joint bills for a specific period.

A joint checking account is good, but each should have their own checking account.  Why?  Because if you two only have a joint checking account, you get hit by a truck and die, the joint checking account will be frozen, and your wife will not have access to the funds until she gets your death certificate and works it out with the bank.

Second time around we started out with separate accounts.  When our work hours required me to drive 3 counties away to deposit his check for him we eventually set up one joint savings and one joint checking.

I agree with an earlier response that advised you to take advantage of on base financial and marriage counseling.  I also urge you to make sure you have a POD beneficiary on all your accounts.  My widowed mother had me on a joint account and it was so helpful when she passed because we lived in different towns and I didn\u2019t have to front my and spouse\u2019s money for things.  Because spouse was already on our joint account I had mom as our POD beneficiary so if we were killed together she had instant access to our funds to make things easier.

But I otherwise totally agree with you and also think additional accounts are very helpful for parsing our money. House fund, rainy day fund, your money for her birthday present, her money for your birthday present, etc", "As things are right now, she is my main beneficiary yeah. I also told her that having more accounts than 1 is good for extra security. Thing is, her parents are heavily involved and she values their stances on things heavily (when she sees fit) and also considers them experienced enough to know \"the way\"", "She'll make her parents beneficiary.", "Any account can be - and *should be* IMHO - set up with a POD (payable on death) beneficiary.  Especially with a military career.  Guys I\u2019ve known designated a spouse or parent.", "Joint account doesn\u2019t have to freeze if one dies.  There\u2019s a difference in accounts (and titles) between him and her vs him and/or her.", "You know what, I am inclined to agree with you. I think it was clear on my part, or perhaps I had a different view on how we'd approach this subject specifically. Thing is, we've opened a shared acc a while ago and I told her I planned on using it to cover main costs. But, she and I never sat down to discuss the details. We were busy doing other things and making plans. Not an excuse, but yeah that is the way it is", "This should be top comment.", "I thank you for your cut and clear answer...even though its quite painful to read. The truth cuts deep I guess!", "Jesus a few paragraphs from a single perspective and you\u2019re convinced divorce is the only way to go?", "\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 feel free to say it to your wife.", "Have you asked why she is so short of money?\n\nIf she wants to share finances, she should be willing to be completely transparent about her finances.\n\nFurther, you should not proceed further until she shares everything and you understand what is going on.\n\nBut that's a necessary, but not sufficient condition for you to share finances. In other words, even if you gain complete understanding of her financial situation, that still does not obligate you to share one account.\n\nYou might, for instance, discover she's subsidizing her parents, which would explain why they are so adamant you share one account with her.", "It's customary in this day in age to have separate accounts and one \"bill paying\" shared account. That way she has her money to do what she wants and you have your money for what you want to do. Though it's still customary to discuss large purchases. Having the in-laws dragged into your relationship is a big red flag that sounds like they all want access to all your money. Do in laws need help financially?", "OP, sounds to me like your wife just doesn\u2019t know how to disagree.  #1, the bills are being paid.  #2, you aren\u2019t telling her how to spend her money.  Only real question I have is whether the joint account is funded according to income (pro-ratio) or just a 50/50 split of the expenses.  Does she have less available money because she makes less and contributes a greater portion of her income?  As for learning how to disagree, that\u2019s something that CAN be taught in a counseling setting.  I\u2019d also want to have full access and review her spending before I gave her full access to 100% of my income.", "Why? Like I want to reserve all judgement, but I genuinely do not understand her response. Did she explain why she had such a strong reaction? \n\nThe dynamic of her going to her parents seems really unhealthy. If you don\u2019t mind me asking, how old are you all and how long have you been together?", "Charitably, I suppose it\u2019s possible that she sees shared finances as a facet of true commitment and marriage, and just doesn\u2019t know how to deal with you not wanting to do it so she made threats and ran to her parents. She may have no nefarious intent. But that doesn\u2019t mean what she said and did isn\u2019t abusive or that she won\u2019t continue to be when she doesn\u2019t get her way. \nHow old is she?", "You are in the military.  Recap this conversation to your coworkers.  Look for some of the older guys that have been there.\n\nI suspect they will give you some very hard facts on what you have just signed up for.  \n\nThis is a lot worse than you think it is this is a symptom and not the actual issue.  I would be analyzing every aspect of this relationship with a third party.  I suspect after a list is presented an annulment would be ideal.\n\nI am sure your gut is telling you something.", "I\u2019m so sorry OP. I would be very careful going forward.", "You are right.  But I have to write that I do know of one recent incident with a family member where the husband passed away, the bank froze the joint account, and the wife could not access the funds until she provided a death certificate.  What is wrong?  Yes, but it still took a week or so to resolved.  But again, you are right.", "Good luck to you (and to your wife).  I hope it all works out.", "You said she's always low on cash... does she ever end up in the red? If you combine, she'll do that to your account. Don't cave. You need to have a talk with her and have her parents butt the hell out. Currently, there are four of you in this marriage. That will not go well. \n\nIf she continues to say she can't stay married to you, then get an annulment, but do not cave in... her parents will run your life. This is a hill worth dying on.", "#1 problem - her parents should NOT be involved.  Unless they\u2019re supporting you, they don\u2019t get a vote.", "I get that. It\u2019s one thing to not discuss kids but finances, if they\u2019ve gone smoothly up until that point, is something one might assume will just sort themselves out easily and don\u2019t require a dedicated discussion.", "Do not get marrage advice from people online. Don't do it.\n\nYou'll have relationship teething problems for years. She'll go to her parent's to try to emotionally charge the argument - have a chat with her dad - tell him that it's your marriage, and if he wants to respect you, he'll stay away from taking sides.\n\nThere is an old saying - What's hers is hers, what's yours is hers.\n\nRemind her that you'll be able to see all her spending. She'll be able to see any time you bought her something as a present - so there will never be any surprises. There are plenty of downsides of fully joint spending accounts.\n\nIf you can't trust her with a joint account then it's bigger problems.", "Well Yes - the two giveaways were when the wife threatened divorce over the issue and when the in laws were dragged into the discussion. It\u2019s not sustainable for every issue to be a marriage ending ultimatum and that this has happened already is a clear sign. Maybe marriage counselling is worth a shot but some pretty clear boundaries with the in laws would need to be draw", "I think one problem here is assuming anything \u201ccustomary\u201d\n\nPeople often assume that however they grew up is how most people do things. That\u2019s their \u201ccustom\u201d.", "I agreed to do it pro ratio because I earn more than she does, I didnt mind at all. Her expenses would be quite low compared to mine so I thought everything was fine", "I agreed to do it pro ratio because I earn more than she does, I didnt mind at all. Her expenses would be quite low compared to mine so I thought everything was fine", "She claims that my reluctance gives her reason not to trust me, or that perhaps I do not trust her with my money. She also made the weird claim that she feels less of a wife to me, and that we cannot truly become \"one\" unless we share a single account.\nIt was very disheartening to hear because none of this matters to me, I truly consider her my wife and I fully trusted her, until she hit me with this wave of angry emotion", "My gut is defo telling me things, things I dont like to see or hear. I will have one more conversation with my wife on this topic and make it crystal clear how I feel about this", "That, and I also didnt assume it was such a big deal, you know? I thought to myself, as long as we work together to pay the shared expenses and put some money on the side when possible, then we are good. I never expected to be accused of being stupid or terrible for wanting to keep my own banking account, nor did I assume she'd come at me with a divorce ultimatum", "you should definitely discuss kids before marriage as well. if one of you wants them but the other doesnt, that should be discussed prior to marriage", "Don\u2019t get me wrong it\u2019s a very concerning post but I also think a lot more info would be needed before deciding that a divorce is the way to go. If OP truly loves his wife and they otherwise have a good relationship, he could try just setting a firm boundary as first course of action. If she leaves then she leaves", "I tend to agree.  She was the one who put the ultimatum of combining accounts or divorce.  Seems like the option is divorce", "You mentioned that you always have money in your account, where she's always low on funds. I get an impression that you are, at least to some degree, a saver, where she is a spender.\n\nWould that be the case? Is she the sort of person where paychecks and gifts of money at special occassions are spent on stuff she wants (not needs, but wants) almost before they've hit the bank (or never hit the bank for cash gifts)?", "Spouse told me the same thing. Don't fall for it!", "Yeah no. Your in-laws don't get to basically force you to do anything. Boundaries need to be set. Once you figured out it was an ambush gang up session you should have left, now this shit is gonna happen over and over when your wife doesn't get her way. Red flag #1  \nThis sounds totally ridiculous to me and suspicious. Why are her parents so concerned with her having access to YOUR money? Red flag #2\n\nShe is laying it on thick with the manipulation attempts. Hold your ground. She brought all of this up for a reason. The initial request to merge accounts, having the parents help her by ganging up on you and all of the emotional manipulation.\n\n I'd be interested in the why, because you aren't being told something. Why is she so adamant?", "I\u2019d be really interested to hear her reasoning on how that makes her feel like less of a wife or makes it seem like you don\u2019t trust her. Because I want to give the benefit of the doubt, but it makes absolutely no sense to me. As an adult o always had more than one bank account for myself, so I can\u2019t imagine having one and only one with my wife.\n\nAlso, very simply question. The gifts you buy from each other all would come from the same account? Every person think you each by for yourself comes from the same account? Sounds like a budgeting nightmare, again assuming the absolute best intentions from her still", "Again.... this is a symptom....\n\nTrust your gut.  I wish someone would have told me that in my youth.", "For sure. I meant that kids is a must-have discussion. Finances are something that often just fall into place over time when both people are rational and reasonable.", "Man, I just don\u2019t know. This is a triple whammy of financial sketchiness and attempts at financial control, intrusive parents and divorce threats from noncompliance. All this in a few months.", "I don\u2019t disagree at all. It\u2019s certainly concerning. But at the same time we don\u2019t know how long the couple has been together and if they have had previous financial conversations. This could be some severe immaturity and not necessarily something more insidious", "Yeah I will defo try my best to work this out with her, whilst also having firm boundaries and making it clear that her parents are NOT a part of this. My mother is standing on the side lines as support for us both but after what happened, she is on my side. She always respected my relationship and gave me the space and time to figure things out. The same cannot not be said of her parents"]}
