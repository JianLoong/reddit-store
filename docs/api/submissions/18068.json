It was wonderful, and for a while I truly experienced the \"marriage euphoria\". We did butt heads sometimes but that was mostly due to our different personalities, I think. \n\nAnyway, a few days ago as we were going on a walk, she asked me if I wanted to combine all of our banking accounts so we can share one. Currently, we have our own seperate accounts and 1 extra shared account to pay all the bills with. I agreed to put more money on it than her since I earn more. I have always been generous with my money towards her, always treated her with gifts and above all, I offered financial stability. However, even though we recently got married, I like having my own banking account because it grants me some autonomy, and I am simply used to it. \n\nShe did not agree with it, nor did her parents. They all claimed I was being an idiot for not wanting 1 account, and apparently I hurt her feelings for keeping my own account. \nI have no secrets for her, but they assume I do now due to my reluctance. For some reason, she is always low on money (whilst having a job) but I always have money in the bank. I am in the military and honestly, I really dont need the extra added stress just because they think I am committing treason (apparently?)\nHer father made me out to be too old school and controlling after I adamantly stated I wanted to keep seperate accounts. Her mother said her daughter is doomed if I am away for a mission or whatever, without her having access to my money. In an angry fit (and while they were ganging up on me) my wife said that if I dont want to use 1 account with her, she cant remain married to me...seems overly dramatic to me? \n\nAm I the asshole? I am asking because I truly love her, but my friends have all said this is a HUGE red flag. Heck, even my mother is outraged about this. If you want more context, by all means feel free to ask! There are definitely more details to the story, but I dont want to oversaturate this part\n\nEdit: I never expected so many honest responses so quickly! This is my very first post on this reddit page, reading all your comments really helped me realise a few things about myself and my marriage.

When my cousin found out, she wasn't happy and also worried.  They had a lot of conversations. Made a household budget and individual ones. To pay the debt down sooner, she offered to pay a higher portion of the joint bills for a specific period.

Second time around we started out with separate accounts.  When our work hours required me to drive 3 counties away to deposit his check for him we eventually set up one joint savings and one joint checking.

I agree with an earlier response that advised you to take advantage of on base financial and marriage counseling.  I also urge you to make sure you have a POD beneficiary on all your accounts.  My widowed mother had me on a joint account and it was so helpful when she passed because we lived in different towns and I didn\u2019t have to front my and spouse\u2019s money for things.  Because spouse was already on our joint account I had mom as our POD beneficiary so if we were killed together she had instant access to our funds to make things easier.

This doesnt bode well for him.", "Yes, I get the feeling the one, shared account would flow to the in-laws.  There\u2019s just too much pressure on OP to do this.", "Are you Dutch? \"Wauw\"", "Yeah but they don't get a vote. Marriage isn't a democracy that involves the whole family.", "How long were you guys together before marriage? I have a feeling not very long.", "If you keep a few thousand in it, that should be no problem as there should always be money set aside for unexpected expenses (she should have her own personal account for the same reason).  It would only be a problem if you kept over $100,000 in an account in the Cayman Islands.", "My husband and I have our finances set up as you do, shared bills account, and our own. I don't want to have to justify how I spend my money (I am the primary earner), and I don't care how he spends his. \n\nThat doesn't say anything about our marriage except that we are both a combined couple and individual people.  I actually think it's healthier that way.  If your wife is reading more into it than that, then you have a huge red flag.", "You should start by understanding her financial situation and spending habits \u2014 not by sharing accounts. She wants more transparency? Both of you should look over the accounts of the other person, pull a credit report to find out what debt they have etc. I suspect that you\u2019ll find some pretty big red flags on her end but you won\u2019t know until you go down this road. The next step after this is to meet with a financial counselor (or possibly a divorce lawyer if her financial situation is too egregious)", "Yikes. They are not in the right here. It\u2019s time to take a deep dive into her finances and understand how she is mismanaging her money. Good luck since after finding out, you may wish that you weren\u2019t married", "If there are any doubts about the stability of your marriage, do not have children until you work things out. If you think your life is in turmoil now, you have no idea what having children would add to the mix.", "Take her up on her offer. Have an annulment form pre populated and next time she demands access to every dollar you have, ask her to countersign.", "There\u2019s a whole system in place for expressing this exact sentiment. You can even have an impact! \nJust upvote it", "Your duty station should have some sort of financial literacy and/or financial planning resources available for you and your wife to access.  Your bank should as well.\n\nI would suggest going to MWR and see if they can point you in the right direction.\n\nHonestly though, your wife's reaction is seriously concerning.  Marital counseling through military onesource should also be a priority.", "Don't wait until you deploy and have her Clean Out Everything You Own. If you've been in military any time at all, you've Seen It Happen", "Normally I'd agree with you but the wife threw out the \"my way or no marriage card\" already.  If he isn't going to give into to her ridiculous (and frankly very suspicious) demands-- and he seems WAY too smart for that-- then wife is saying the alternative is divorce.", "Having read the post and considered the wife's freak out, while I do think one serious discussion between spouses with no parents is warranted, I do suspect that chances are this'll end in divorce. Wife doesn't sound ready for either marriage itself or financial responsibility.", "Well the wife is already throwing around the divorce option.", "Or spending frivolously and they don\u2019t want to bail her out again.", ">It's customary in this day in age to have separate accounts and one \"bill paying\" shared account.\n\nYeah, no. It's becoming normal. It's by no way customary.  This sub is filled with whether or not it's OK to have split finances or combined. Lots of people do it. Lots of people don't do it.", "I already had. Thanks though.", "This is true.", "What exactly are her \"expenses\"?  Does she work full time?  Are you in the US-- the military here isn't known for great pay and you mention she makes considerably less that you.  What percentage of the \"household\" expenses does she cover vs you?\n\nHas she been giving her parents or other family members money? \n\nIf it's a genuine problem with her not having enough left for a reasonable amount of personal money that's something you can both work on WITHOUT combining all of your accounts.  \n\nA technique that has always served me well is to know and state your hard boundary at the start of the discussion and be clear that no discussion that involved going past that line is going to happen.\n\nFor example:  \"Ok, you have some financial concerns here.  Let me start by saying that there isn't going to be any further combining of our accounts so we won't be discussing that but I'm open to discussing anything else that doesn't involve that.\" \n\nOffer her financial counselling if she's having trouble managing her money or even marriage counselling-- or personal counselling for her.  It's important to keep reiterating that there are some things that are options and some things that aren't going to be options. \n\nNTA but your wife and in-laws are ice skating on Ahole Lake", "This is a trap! But since she wants more honesty, start by going in detail over each of your personal accounts for be past few years. Pull credit reports for each of you. You can help the transparency in your relationship by seeing how both of you spend your money and what debt that you have.", "It sounds like she's the one who can't be trusted & may spend the money when you don't even know where it's going.", "FYI, it may be different where you live, so look into local laws, but whether the money is in an account in your name or a joint account, anything earned during the course of the marriage is a marital asset. Meaning that in the event of divorce she will be privy to half of whatever is in your solo accounts. If you have proof (bank statements prior to marriage) of what was a pre-marital asset that amount can be protected. So keep in mind that even if her name isn't on it, she has a right to it. This goes both ways of course, but it sounds like she 1) has nothing, 2) is hiding what she has, or 3) is in debt. \n\nPlease get to the bottom of this OP. This sounds very sketchy.", "They're being overboard and rude for sure so now it does seem like you're making the right decision.  I'd absolutely be cautious too after this reaction.  \n\nBut a lot of people consider merging accounts after marriage to be the standard, so those people would of course be weary and concerned that someone being so adamantly opposed to doing that might have something to hide.  Not saying I agree with it, but you should at least consider that it's maybe part of the reason this has become so hostile.\n\nYou thought it went without saying that finances wouldn't change after marriage, and she thought it went without saying that they *would*.   And because of that you're now both distrustful of each other.\n\nFrankly I think the best thing you two could do right now is sit down without any parents and lay out bank statements/financial info so that you're both aware of where the other one stands and there are no secrets or doubts about infidelity or debts or overspending or whatever.  Then go from there.\n\nFor what it's worth, I think you both should consider doing almost the opposite of your current set up.  Paychecks deposit into the joint account, and nearly every single expense is paid through there and extra funneled to savings.  Smaller (but equal) amounts should then be transferred to your own accounts for fun money/surprises/etc.", "Talk about retirement planning too. It feels way, way off, but if y'all decided to do separate finances, what happens when one of you doesn't plan properly for retirement?", "Aren't you in the military where they taught toplan for everything and prepare for the worst? Rather than \"hope it work\" is the last mentality and not the default first choice. It's not rare what happen in military family. There's common story points and trends that would don't want to happen to you.", "The divorce ultimatum seems weird. As others have pointed out, you both have a right to marital assets. But it makes complete sense to me to keep separate bank accounts. My wife and I have been living together for 31 years, married for almost 28, and we've always had separate accounts. After we got married, we made them both joint accounts, so that we could both access them if needed (e.g., in case of illness, etc.), but I manage mine and she manages hers. That way we don't have to worry about overdrafts and cash flow. We have an agreement that we'll discuss large purchases, but we've found that things work out fine in terms of savings if we decide individually on smaller ones. (New car? Discuss. New backpack? Buy. New bicycle? Edge case, depending on the cost.)", "Cool. If enough people feel the same way it\u2019ll end up at the top. If not, then it shouldn\u2019t be there", "I have to go back to that red flags and the bull quote to be sure to get it right. LOL", "It might be hers by right, but some people need protecting from their own spending habits.

She can't spend it of its in OPs bank account and he transfers to her when she needs it.", "Another \"must have\" discussion I have learned about through Reddit is pets. \n\nIf one person is a pet lover and needs the love of a pet in their life and the partner hates animals and is cruel to them, the marriage is doomed.", "No need to over explain Reddit. I was just expressing my complete agreement with a comment meant to insinuate that I think more people should agree with the above comment."]}
