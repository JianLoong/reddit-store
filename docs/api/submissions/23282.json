My son tried to talk to me but I ignored him, so I could speak with principle. The principal told me that he has apparently been sexually harassing her. Following her around making sexual remarks, and trying to touch her inappropriately. I was furious and asked about his punishment. He is being suspended for 2 weeks and will have in school suspension for another week after that. When I got out and saw my son I immediately started yelling at him. Saying how he has disappointed me and has completely disgusted me, I wanted a written apology, sent to the student he harrased and I would be taking all of his electronics, he will be doing a hefty amount of chores and will be telling his father (who has shared custody with me and is a cop) about what he has done and he will not be going to a comic event next week. My son started to she'd crocodile tears saying she was lying and that he would never so such a thing. I ignored his statement and walked to the car. When we got home I called his father and told him to get over here and that it was important. His father was also with his brother so he tagged along. When my son told them what happened and the punishment he was receiving, his uncle stated that his is already being suspended and yelling at in front of his peers and that it was punishment enough. I looked at him and told him to go parent his own kids, because this didn't concern him. (he also doesn't have any kids) and when he actually parents and raises his own children, he can tell me how to parent mine. He stormed out yelling that I was being a b**ch and that I was on a power trip. I think my punishment was suited and that it could have been worse so AITA?\n\nEdit: His phone's messages and recordings from other students had shown him harrassing her. I was so mad that I forgot to put that in there.

And the uncle needs to be kept away from your son.", "NTA. WoW. I m in awe of you.\n\nWhat you did was awesome. If you had say nothing, you would have just enabled his behavior.\n\nI dont even know how you daily deal with your son behaving like it did, its so abject.   \nI dont think i could stand it, caring and loving for someone for so many years all so that he could abuse women.", "So NTA. Your BIL and your son are major AH. You have proof he was harassing her, he deserves more punishment than just a suspension. Also, check what he has being watching online or try to find the source of this awful behavior.", "Everyone who says they wouldn\u2019t do this are lying their asses off. \n\nScreaming in public at your kid is a bad move, but the why makes it reasonable. Definitely NTA. The uncle is an ass for butting into something that doesn\u2019t concern him. Your kid needs to learn that it\u2019s unacceptable to harass another person. Your punishment is fairly tamed to what could actually have happened to him. \n\nI am curious though, what did your ex say?", "NTA\u2026 BUT punishment alone is unlikely to \u201cteach him a lesson\u201d in the way you want. Clearly something has fallen down either in the education he\u2019s been given about consent etc or how he\u2019s regulating himself and translating it into action. Please, please, please, please, please make it clear to him that he has the opportunity going forward to redeem himself with different behaviour, help him to understand the impact of his actions, and try keep open lines of communication about sex, relationships, boundaries etc going forward.", "NTA.\n\nYour son absolutely needs to receive a hefty punishment, and you're right - it's not uncle's business, so he can mind his own.  However, I think you ***urgently need*** to get your kid in therapy.  Why does he think harassing a girl is acceptable behavior in the first place?  What content is he consuming that supports this behavior?  Who is he spending time with that is telling him this is ok?  Where is this coming from?  This needs to be immediately addressed.  Please get him into therapy to help squash whatever is making him think this is ok.", "oh my god NTA. all the dudes saying YTA are giving mad sexual predator vibes", "You were fortunate that the students story was confirmed by other witnesses. That being the case the embarrassment of being reprimanded in public hopefully will be enough for him to pause in the future to do that again. That is NOT acceptable behavior, best to catch it early and fix it.", "Nta he can't conduct himself in a civilised manor?  Then he doesn't get to go out in public and do fun stuff.  There will be, *gasp*, women!! at the comic convention and he just proved he can't be around women without acting badly.  So he doesn't get to go.", "NTA. Also, the uncle called you a b\\*\\*\\*h. Jesus, it didn't take long for him to show his true colours, turning it into a women vs. men thing. Fact is, your son messed up. Hopefully, he will learn from it. You did well, I'd also be pissed. You yelled at him in front of a few kids in school, he'll be fine. Imagine if this happened when he was older and an entire nation was yelling at him in a court room. I hope he takes this as a lesson and will be grateful for your intervention 10 years from now.", "NTA - He needs to learn to respect others.  That this type of behavior is not even a little bit allowed.  Have Dad take him down to the jail and show your son what happens to people who do what he did when he turns 18 (<2 years).  And then tell him about having to register as a sex offender and what that will do to his reputation.  He's old enough to know better and close enough to being an adult that you don't have to tip toe around it.", "NTA this is the kind of shit that escalates when it goes unchecked.  Good on you for taking it seriously.", "NTA. You are 100% right.", "NTA. You have proof that he has harassed this girl and she was brave enough to come forward. Sexual harassers should absolutely be humiliated, publicly or privately, especially when he was humiliating this girl in school, somewhere she should be safe. Normally, I would say disciplining a kid shouldn\u2019t involve public humiliation, but that flies out the window the moment they are bullying or harassing other humans.", "The kid is lucky that the police weren\u2019t involved. They could have hauled him out to handcuffs and I\u2019m sure that would have been way more embarrassing.", "NTA he needs to get into therapy though before something really bad happens", "Based on your edit NTA and thank you for taking his behaviour seriously", "Hope all the people saying Y T A take it back, I saw the edit and obviously you are right to treat a sexual harasser this way. I'm glad you did the right thing.", "NTA. But as others have pointed out you need to find out what is actually causing this behaviours. He has picked this up from somewhere, possibly watching tate or picking it up from peers or even adult men around him. Give it a couple of days so you can both calm down then try and have a really open discussion and teach him why this behaviour is wrong.\n\nI don't know if there is a US equivalent but where I live we have rape crisis centres that do sexual violence prevention workshops at schools. They basically have age appropriate discussions and lessons with young people, and the boys mostly really appreciate it and it really opens their eyes. It's maybe reaching out to organisations like this even just for advice on how to approach this, or get some materials from them. The sexual violence pyramid is also a good thing to show him if you can find it on Google. Basically explains why harassment and sexism might seem relatively innocuous, but feeds into the attitudes that perpetuate other, more serious forms of Gender Based Violence.", "Good job, mama.\n\nI would trade off some of the punishment for something more on point. Discipline means teaching and he needs to get educated on why this is a big deal. \n\nFor example, he could study up and write a few pages on sexual consent and harassment that demonstrate an increased understanding of the subject.", "The situation definitely calls for intervention and punishment. I think you're doing the right thing. I'm not sure I would have yelled at him in public like that, but that seems pretty minor given the situation.\n\nOn top of his punishment, I would also get the kid into some therapy. There might be more going on here that needs to be addressed. Just in case.", "NTA. Nip this behavior now before he ends up with a record.", "NTA, to all of the comments about not publicly reprimanding him, didn't some of this happen to the girl, in a school/public setting? Eye for an eye. IMO", "Until he admits and becomes contrite, the punishment is not working. Can we talk about reparations instead of only punishment? NTA but job not done yet. Good luck momma!", "NTA. At all. From a parent.", "NTA - he will thank you later...", "NTA he needs to understand the seriousness of what he was doing. I do hope you sit down with him and explain the consequences of his actions and how he likely made her feel, so that he not only knows what he did wrong but understands why it was wrong. Understanding is just as important as punishment in my opinion and has a more lasting effect.", "NTA, the punishment fits the crime. this is disgusting behaviour and you're sending a solid message that this is not acceptable behaviour at all. If it happens again make him binge watch feminist videos and videos of SA victims/survivors so that he can see things from their point of view and why this behaviour matters. Good on you for taking this so seriously and doing your best.", "Go Mom!!!!  Absolutely NTA. He is fortunate to get caught now and can learn from it. I\u2019m sorry you have to deal with this.", "NTA, he was publicly humiliating the female student with his harassment at school, what you did was not only warranted, it was appropriate. And you were right to tell his uncle what you did. He\u2019s not the parent, so he doesn\u2019t get a say. I  curious what your sons dad thought of the situation?", "NTA Actions have consequences. He doesn't realize the seriousness of what he had done and then he lied to you despite there being proof. What you are doing is a fitting punishment for what he did. He needs that time without his electronics or events to think about his actions. I wish more parents were like you.", "NTA but your ex's brother sure as heck is. Probably was going to go for \"boys will be boys\" next... Your kid is lucky that his momma gives a damn and the girl is probably super relieved that you believed her. Too many mothers refuse to see their sons as anything other than perfect angels. Of course a parent should stand up for their child until all the facts are available if there is doubt but as you clarified, there was none, so totally correct response.", "NTA.. as parents the fact that you even thought enough about your actions that you made this post shows me you have a heart & a conscious. Sometimes our kids do things that need correction!!", "NTA He and his dad and uncle should be glad he is not wearing an ankle monitor and reporting as a sexual offender. He needs education about age, consent and what constitutes any type of harassment.  Even writing the victim a letter could be considered harassment.  Advice him not to approach or speak to her again or have nay of his friends approach on his behalf.  Next time he won't be suspended he could be locked up.", "NTA\n\nStand your ground. You're a good mom. But you might look into therapy for him so it doesn't escalate.", "NTA. You might look into what type of stuff he's been reading and watching. Seems some men are buying into crap like Andrew Tate. Toxic sexism.", "NTA", "NTA. What, if anything did his father have to say about his actions and the punishment you decided on?", "NTA, good job parenting and uncle-ing !", "Let me start by expressing my surprise that the school had your son and his victim wait in the same school lobby together. The school is an asshole to inflict that on the victim.\n\nThank you for coming down hard on your son. Too often the sort of behavior he has been engaging with is excused as \"boys will be boys\". People who behave like him in high school are the same people who become frat boy rapists in college. He needs a dramatic attitude change.\n\nBut he won't have an attitude change because you gave him a load of chores. In all probability, your son's friends are sexist jerks, and they probably consume social media produced by sexist jerks. People like this often think that \"it's funny\" or \"it was just a joke\" or whatever. You need to spend time with him to make him understand why each and every bad action he did was wrong. Have him explain to you why this text message was offensive, why trying to touch a girl without her consent is wrong, and so on.\n\nNTA", "What?!
