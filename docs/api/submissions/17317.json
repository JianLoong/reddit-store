{"id": 17317, "submission_id": "13ibqjr", "title": "AITA for making fun of someone for eating wrong?", "selftext": "So I (18F) recently got back from a small family vacation for my cousin \"Abby\" (18F) birthday. Abby invited her friends, including Billy (18M) The trip was to Mexico and Billy is one of those people who is \"16% Mexican\" and wouldn't shut up about it. He would always get on our backs about how we were pronouncing words wrong, not understanding certain customs, etc. It got annoying after he did it six times at dinner on the first night. \n\nOn our last day, we had stopped for lunch at this buffet-type place and all of us had gotten tamales. If you don't know how they work, tamales are a type of food that is wrapped in a corn husk, you unwrap the corn husk, kind of like a present, and then you eat what's inside. While we were sitting down about to eat, Billy picked up his tamale and ate it with the corn husk still on. Now, something about me is that I  have a very expressive face, and while we were all surprised when Billy did that, my face was probably cartoonishly shocked and Billy noticed. He asked me what was wrong and I  kind of laughed and told him that he was supposed to unwrap the tamale. Billy told me that I  had no idea what I  was talking about, but Abby chimed in saying that I  was right. I  started laughing, which I  admit was kind of a bitchy thing to do, but I  couldn't help it. Billy got mad and left and one of our friends told me off and called me a bitch because \"He didn't know any better\" and ran after him. The rest of us stayed and talked and we all left the next day. \n\nYesterday, Abby's sister had a birthday party and Billy was invited. While I  was there, he came up to me and kept implying that I  owed him an apology, but never said anything he was just super passive-aggressive about the whole thing. I never apologized and one of our mutual friends came up to me and said that I should just apologize. Abby said that I didn't need to but I do kind of feel bad because I laughed at him in front of everyone.

He really got mad or embarrassed or both when he received confirmation that he, indeed, did not know how to eat a tamale.  I also think that\u2019s why you laughed.
