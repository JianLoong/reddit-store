I feel like that might not be the best idea because none of the other kids are hiking with us, and plus, I just want a day to get away from being a father and just kind of be myself with the guys, so I told him if he can keep up with us then he can do it. To be honest, I think if he really stuck with us the whole way, he would probably be bored, as there aren't that many common topics btwn my buddies and I and my son, like it was just be awkward and out of place.\n\nSo on the day of the hike, my son was super giddy, so we started hiking, we slowly started to pick up the pace, and then after a particularly tough uphill climb, he started to lag behind, and he finished half of his water. I grew concerned, so I told him to wait here for the second group as they're only 20 minutes behind us, and mom will have some water, because we weren't carrying much water with us because we're alot more tougher and seasoned hikers. He did what I told him, and the hike went well.\n\nBut when I got home, my wife got really mad at me, she asked me if I left Alex behind intentionally, at first I said no, but then I said we just went our normal pace because Alex wouldn't really enjoy hiking with the dads and I did it for him, because I knew he would have fun with the kids, and that he's just in this tween phase of trying to seem grownup.

We were Americans (military), Germans hate us, and I was alone with no way to communicate to adults or other kids. I caught up to them in no more than 5 minutes but I was scared out of my mind.
