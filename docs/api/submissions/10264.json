What? \n\nSecond, you seem to have no trouble with your friend, Clara, making racist \u201cjokes\u201d about Laura\u2019s heritage, but when Laura makes a joke, it\u2019s suddenly an issue.

They are not \u201cmarried\u201d with quotes, they are married. It\u2019s not \u201cannoying\u201d for them to snuggle together. They are a couple. That\u2019s what couples do. Not only are you disrespectful to Laura, but you\u2019re also disrespectful towards Mark\u2019s boundaries and choices. Rather than talking to him and asking how he feels, you\u2019re projecting all your contempt towards Laura onto him as if he\u2019s a victim, when he very well could not be. \n\nThere\u2019s more I could say, but if I were to point out everything that makes YTA we\u2019d be here all day.

Please get yourself into therapy and show your therapist these posts.", "Girl YTA\u2026 I read your earlier post and you really need to sit back and think about things. This obvious signs that your view is warped are as follows: You openly criticise the girl for wearing heels? Why? You expect her to changer her style to suit Mark (who may be perfectly happy to see her in heels btw) but get upset when he grows facial hair because she likes it. Short men can be very attractive. Short men who have height issues and project are usually unattractive. Mark seems to have this nailed. People can make changes when they meet someone new be that in appearance or in activities, they open up to new things, as long as this isn\u2019t forced upon them it\u2019s fine. You think she should tolerate your friend\u2019s racism but you can\u2019t even tolerate a newly wed couple cuddling under a blanket!

Couples will sometimes banter between themselves and make jokes, personally it\u2019s not for me but to each their own and if they are happy with it it\u2019s not your place to interfere. Your joke about him throwing you round the bedroom was wildly inappropriate and completely uncalled for. Even taking out the \u201csex\u201d\nelement out it was derogatory to both of them, implying that he is too short or she is too tall.

Repeatedly.\n\nI read your other post and comments - you\u2019ve found every excuse to find fault with Laura, paint Mark as a victim and insert yourself as the tiny, acceptably attractive girl that he should want.

You do know the courthouse thing is the same paperwork you sign at any other kind of wedding and it is that paperwork, not a walk down an aisle, that makes you married, right? \n\nYou and wife are different kinds of people. You don\u2019t have to like her, you don\u2019t have to understand her. Mark loves her, and you need to get it together and shut up about it or mark is going to slowly slide you out of his life. You\u2019re annoyed about them sitting together, talking, taking up each other\u2019s time (as newly married couples do), and cuddling. You are getting perilously close to that point. \n\nIf you can\u2019t behave politely in wife\u2019s company, take a step back from the friendship with him until you can, or until you\u2019ve gotten over mark, if you\u2019re in love with him.", "YTA.
