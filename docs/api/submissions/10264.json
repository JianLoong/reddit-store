She didn\u2019t react at all (which was super freaky), but Mark looked extremely angry which shocked me as he\u2019s never been angry at me.

What? \n\nSecond, you seem to have no trouble with your friend, Clara, making racist \u201cjokes\u201d about Laura\u2019s heritage, but when Laura makes a joke, it\u2019s suddenly an issue.

They are not \u201cmarried\u201d with quotes, they are married. It\u2019s not \u201cannoying\u201d for them to snuggle together. They are a couple. That\u2019s what couples do. Not only are you disrespectful to Laura, but you\u2019re also disrespectful towards Mark\u2019s boundaries and choices. Rather than talking to him and asking how he feels, you\u2019re projecting all your contempt towards Laura onto him as if he\u2019s a victim, when he very well could not be. \n\nThere\u2019s more I could say, but if I were to point out everything that makes YTA we\u2019d be here all day.

I'm going to use your words to give you clear examples of this.  \n\nMy friend Mark recently got \u201cmarried\u201d to Laura. I put that in quotes because they didn\u2019t have a wedding; just went to the courthouse and threw a small gathering that I attended.   -  When I married my husband, we didn't have a huge ceremony, and because we were in an extremely remote location with lots of restrictions, we didn't have any of our family there.  We've been happily married for 30 years.  When our son got married, due to various circumstances, he and his wife got married at a courthouse with just a few of us in attendance, and a dinner afterwards.  They've been happily married for 6 years.  The fact that you put married in quotes, with your explanation as to why you do is insulting to pretty much everyone who has gotten married at a courthouse, and is especially insulting to those who you personally know, and whose courthouse wedding you attended.  As someone who has been married for a long time, there are things I wasn't interested in before, but did with my husband because he did, and now they interest me as well, and there are things I do with him because I enjoy how much he enjoys it.

Maybe at one time he was insecure about it.  But he's obviously ok with the height difference.  Or, maybe he outgrew his insecurities.  Either way, you're the one being small and petty here.  (Pun very much intended - see, it's not fun being the brunt of this sort of \"innocent\" comments, is it?  And I don't even know you.  Imagine how much more hurtful it is when it's constant, and when it's coming from a \"friend\".) \n\nI don't think you're in love with him.  Frankly, I don't think you even like him, because none of the examples you have given sounds like abuse (nor would they even if the genders were reversed).

Maybe you don't want to admit you're attracted to him, but you have a strange obsession with him. I want to try and be understanding because for people like you, you really don't recognize how toxic you are being. The most important thing you need to realize is that it is **not your place**. You haven't given us any substantial proof to show that Laura is a harmful wife (note, she is his *wife*. If they are legally married, it doesn't matter whether they held a lavish ceremony or a quick court binding. They are together in the eyes of the law and you are an intruder at the moment). Your description sounds like a couple ribbing each other, and you immediately jumped to the conclusion that she's terrible because it's convenient for you to latch on to that as an excuse to get her away from Mark.  \n\n\n>The whole time I was trying to talk to Mark, Laura was sitting right next to him making it impossible \ud83d\ude44.\n\nYes. She was sitting next to him because she is his wife. If *you* were dating Mark, and he was sitting next to you but then chose to get up and walk away to chat with Laura, you would have every right to feel jealous and annoyed. But right now you're annoyed because he's doing it with another woman, meaning you're experiencing feelings that would imply you want Mark to talk to you the way he talks to Laura. Even if you're saying \"Just a quick chat would've been fine!\", he is not obligated to give that to you. If you insist you're not attracted to Mark, that's fine, but it sounds like you want to hold on to him because he's kind to you and you're upset that he no longer has the space to show you that sweetness since he's devoting it to his wife.\n\nYou did not \"tell the truth,\" you stated what was on your mind. You thought that was the truth but it isn't. Your **opinion** is that Laura is a bitch and she doesn't deserve Mark. The fact that nobody agrees with you (Mark, Laura, all of your friends, and even objective strangers on the internet) should be enough to tell you that something is wrong with the way you currently think. You need to change your behavior. I'm not saying to change your way of thinking since that's obviously difficult, but you need to realize, objectively, that if you keep acting this way, you are going to be alone and unhappy for the rest of your life.\n\nIt sounds like Mark gave you a second chance (considering he said that you \"always do this,\" so you most likely have done this to another woman that Mark has dated, with the claims and excuses that she was abusive or ugly or not good enough for him.)

Maybe Laura is giving him the confidence he didn't have before. You might be worried because these changes aren't what you're used to seeing in your friend. If he's happy then just be there for him.

Which is whatever, you can date whomever you want.\n\nBut my theory is that whatever else happened, you always felt like the number 1 woman in his life (based on him always confiding in you and never being angry with you). Maybe he enabled this feeling knowingly, maybe he didn't, whatever the case, you felt incredibly secure in your spot.\n\nThat is, until Laura came along and Mark's priorities changed, no longer making you the person his life revolves around.\n\nSo I believe you when you say you're not in love with him, but it's clear you're also not worried about him. You're worried about *your* place in Mark's life.\n\nBut there's good news on that front: you no longer have to worry, because you have single-handedly nuked whatever spot he *was* willing to give you, and you can now sit alone in the crater.", "But in denial about been \"married\"?\n\nThat ship has sailed.

You lashed out at her several times and she retained her composure. Not a red flag. \n\nYou\u2019ve pretty much ruined your friendships with not only mark, but everyone else in your friend group. Even if you sincerely apologize and Mark and Laura forgive you, your relationship will never be the same. All because you cannot accept that Mark chose Laura and is HAPPY. \n\nAnother thing, they are married. You don\u2019t need to quote it like it\u2019s not real. They are. Having a big wedding doesn\u2019t make you any more or less married then a couple who goes to the courthouse, because being married in all cases requires you to sign a license, with witnesses, and then it\u2019s notarized.

You really need to take a long hard look at how your behaviour seems to an objective observer. You sound bitter and twisted.", "No, you\u2019re unhappy. A really marriage is about two people sharing their lives, a wedding has nothing to do with it. Often ones that fail realised they were more interested in a big wedding then a marriage.\n\nI remember your other posts about hun being abused because she asks him to get her stuff, like a drink and he does.

There was another with a mark and Laura and she was complaining about Laura being bossy and always \u201cordering\u201d mark around and how she was abusing him. Her example was when laura asked him to get her a beer. Sounded very similar.\n\nETA: I think OP has made a number of posts in different subs about this because she is desperate for someone to agree with her. Thus far, she\u2019s 0 for 0.", "Shes also the one that told him that, since his wife is taller than him, if he ever missed having someone to throw around in bed, she would be happy to let him do so to her.

Oh yes, and OP thought the friend's comment \"wasn't that bad\".\n\nMark got annoyed with OP for making a joke...which turned out to be that Mark had made a passing comment about about the height differential between him and Laura, and OP had \"joked\" that she was always available for him to fling around his bedroom.\n\n...
