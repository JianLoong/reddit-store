If your son was sitting in his seat, there doesn\u2019t seem like there would have been much he could even do to \u201cwatch his head\u201d. Some people are just oblivious and unaware until you point it out with some common sense on the side as well.", "NTA, not even a little bit. This is why I always just carry it by the straps in front t of me til I hit the jetway. If you're gonna put it on and stand in the exit line and just move forward, fine.

Where was your son supposed to move to get out of the way if he was seated on a plane? The guy with the backpack was the AH. I always hold my bag in front of me until I deplane so I don\u2019t do that exact thing of smacking someone.", "To be fair to her she is more nonconfrontational than anything. She was just looking out for our kid, I just went about it in a different manner and addressed the problem.", "People are afraid of retaliation and confrontation these days and I understand why. However, OP\u2019s wife shouldn\u2019t have gotten upset with OP for pointing out the rudeness of the man in the aisle. \n\nI have family members like this too. They\u2019re overly polite in public spaces and sometimes don\u2019t speak up for their needs. I on the other hand am a little more direct and when I try to get them to speak up and ask for what they want - they shy away.", "I thought it was pretty lame that OP \"addressed\" the situation via the guy overhearing OP talking to his son.\n\nAnd you do, actually, have to watch out for yourself when people are moving about in close quarters. It's a lot of people in a small space trying to be aware of each other but also focused on performing their own tasks. You have to watch that you don't hurt other people, but don't forget to look out for yourself. OP telling his son that he doesn't have to watch his own head was just nonsense. Don't be so naive to think that you can sit there and space out in your own protective bubble. Pay attention, and speak up if a person is creating a dangerous situation.", "No\u2026That doesn\u2019t make it fair at all.", "NAH\n\nBut you can be at no fault and still pay with injury/your life. \n\nIf i cross a road and the signal is green but there is still a car coming fast - sure, i can keep walking bc i'm in the right and the driver is at fault. But i'm still the one dying in the accident. And its the same with your son and the backpack man. You can confront the guy, but your son still should protect his head. Some ppl are just clumsy.", "NTA. Why the fuck is your wife defending the dick who's hitting your son in the face?", "NTA\n\nThe other person needs to learn some de-planing manners.", "YTA - the man with the backpack does not have eyes in his back\n\nwhile it is certainly *appropriate* to ideally expect that man to watch where he swings it, this expectation will not prevent your son from being hit in the face\n\nthe only thing that will **prevent** your son being hit in the face is for him to *watch out* for the swinging backpack\n\nso yes, YTA, because in your version your son should do absolutely nothing despite this giant thing swinging around (in which case he will get smacked in the face)\n\nat that point it becomes an issue of reaction\n\nso are you arguing for *prevention* (like your wife) or are you just assuming any *reaction* would be justified because you can blame the other guy?\n\nman_tapping_head.gif\n\nyou the Ahole man", "NTA", "No, she didn't. She got her son to protect himself from someone who was causing him minor harm. She didn't tell him off, she told him to look after himself. \n\n\nYes, the dude in the backpack should have been more aware of his surroundings and not put it on his back yet. He is to blame. But if someone in the street is throwing things at us, we don't just carry on walking because the other person is to blame. We protect ourselves. \n\n\nWife is confrontation averse and likely concerned things could escalate - there's plenty of videos floating around the internet about people.behaving badly on planes that could scare her. However, she was wrong to tell her husband not to confront him. He's allowed to do as he likes as long as he's not putting their child in danger. \n\n\nSo I'm not sure what my judgement is - maybe ESH?\n\nEdit: typo.", "That was the main thing we argued about. I don't really count it as an accident when you're being negligent and careless. An accident is something you don't intend to happen. This guy just didn't give a shit and was being an asshole.", "NTA when describing the initial confrontation, as the guy with the backpack is. NAH when describing the conflict between the parents, for the reasons you mentioned.", "Negligence implies lack of intent, so literally an accident. Thats why its negligent, because he didnt mean for it to happen, but it still did. So it certainly counts as an accident and is the literal definition of an accident. He didn't pay enough attention and something that could have been avoided, but was also not intended, happened. In this particular case its an accident, that came about due to negligence.", "You have no idea whether the man intended to keep hitting your son or not. No proof whatsoever. He did apologise. This does not give you a free pass to be an AH, no matter his response."]}
