If your son was sitting in his seat, there doesn\u2019t seem like there would have been much he could even do to \u201cwatch his head\u201d. Some people are just oblivious and unaware until you point it out with some common sense on the side as well.", "NTA, not even a little bit. This is why I always just carry it by the straps in front t of me til I hit the jetway. If you're gonna put it on and stand in the exit line and just move forward, fine. Putting it on and then doing all that is just obtuse and inconsiderate. \n\nI wouldn't have expected my son to yoga his way out of constant headknocks either.

It's a lot of people in a small space trying to be aware of each other but also focused on performing their own tasks. You have to watch that you don't hurt other people, but don't forget to look out for yourself. OP telling his son that he doesn't have to watch his own head was just nonsense. Don't be so naive to think that you can sit there and space out in your own protective bubble. Pay attention, and speak up if a person is creating a dangerous situation.", "No\u2026That doesn\u2019t make it fair at all."]}
