I'd certainly get Heather a thank you gift, and proactively apologize just in case she was bothered.", "INFO: when you say training to be a cardiologist, do you mean she's in undergrad/medical school and hopes to be a cardiologist one day, or that she is already a doctor and is completing residency or fellowship?", "NTA\n\nBy 6 months I was engaged.  Other lesbians I know were married by 6 months.\n\nThere is even a joke that a lesbian will jump into a u-haul and move across the country a week after meeting someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is practically family", "NTA.  Maybe Chris is just miffed that you didn't call him.", "NTA, cardiologist trumps a nurse in this case. Yes, it would have been better to call Laura and ask her to bring Heather, but in an emergency your brain doesn't always function rationally. I get that. Glad your mother is feeling better.\n\nEdited to fix familial relationship.", "NAH \n\nIt sounds like you were panicking and your brain jumped onto the nearest apparently logical person. You should speak to Heather and apologise for putting that kind of pressure on her, but I can't call anyone who went through that kind of scare an asshole.", "NTA- you were in a stressful situation, wanting help for your mom. So of course your mind is going to go straight to the person you think could help you.    Chris is just upset he wasn't called first, and might assume he knows more on the subject then what someone training to be a cardiologist would.  (usually that would mean Heather is already a dr going into the specialty of cardiology).\n\nAnyway,,  just get her a nice gift, thank her and tell her how great she will be in the professional with how she handled this. (since the patient /family side is a hard thing to learn)", "NTA, but call her again to thank her. Send them a restaurant gift certificate or something, flowers, who knows. \n\nKeep talking about it, all this crap becomes crap because all the talk stops.\n\nIt isn't always easy but you are building relationships all the time.\n\nKeep at it.", "NTA. I think she probably feels special that you called her. I would have. It sounds like maybe your son is hurt because you didn\u2019t call them first, which is understandable but you called someone who clearly cares about your family, as well.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA.  Even though she is a doctor she's not your family's doctor nor have you established an actual relationship with her. She may have felt in a position where she couldn't say no since she's still new to your family.  Give her a gift to apologize and make a genuine effort to know her outside her profession.", "NAH\n\nBut it\u2019s a bit odd to call her directly when you don\u2019t really know her, and without knowing what you asked it may have been somewhat inappropriate to put her in the spot if she thought you were asking for free medical advice. \n\nIt would have made more sense to call your daughter and ask her to ask Heather if she would mind coming to the hospital to help put your mind at rest", "NAH.\n\nIt was an emergency situation and you panicked. You heard heart problems and called the person you connected with heart issues. If Heather doesn\u2019t mind then there no issue with that, and if there is an issue you should address it with Heather and Laura and not Chris.\n\nHowever, I will add that unless Heather has an affiliation with that hospital then there\u2019s nothing she could do for you that your son couldn\u2019t do. How far along is Heather in her training? Does Chris work at or have connections to the hospital where you took your mother?\n\nYour son is likely dealing with tons of emotions - you called someone your daughter is dating instead of calling your son first and you decided a doctor in training is better help than a licensed RN. I don\u2019t think those feelings are an excuse to lash out but I do see where they are coming from.", "YTA.  Reddit is wild.  A couple months ago a similar situation was posted but from the Dr POV asking if she's the AH for telling people to stop calling her and everyone was saying it's an AH move to call a Dr like that.  So now it's not an AH move?", "NTA\n\nChris is projecting. He was offended that you called Heather and not him, and is berating you about a different issue because saying what he is really feeling makes him look petty.\n\nBy all means, get Heather a thank you gift, as she was wonderful, and you should be nice. But you did nothing wrong.", "In my experience, doctors hate people who want to talk about medical symptoms in social settings, but are quite happy to provide support and translation (of specialist medical terms) in serious situations (like a cardiac event for an elderly person, as was the case here). In addition, hospital staff tend to pay more attention to a patient when there is a personal connection with a fellow hospital staff member or a physician with appropriate expertise; it\u2019s just a natural connection thing. Heather was probably thrilled to know she could get partner brownie points for helping out here. Chris just has his nose out of joint because he came second to a family newcomer.", "nta, you did what you thought was best.\n\nif you now feel guilty, buy Heather a gift, she'll appreciate it", "Jesus, Christ.", "Why is it any of Chris\u2019s business? Tell him to mind his own. \n\nNTA", "NTA. The fact you had her number means it's ok to use it I reckon :) I would ask ANYONE in my vicinity or phone contacts for advice if I were in your situation. \n\nHowever, if you tend to over involve yourself in your kids relationships, maybe think about that, but in this case it was justified. Don't call her for any lesser or any unnecessary things for a least a year and you should be good :)", "NAH. Chris is in the medical field so he knows how often people are hit up for medical advice by acquaintances and it\u2019s a common annoyance for doctors, nurses, etc. it sounds like he\u2019s looking out for Heather and it\u2019s kind of sweet. \n\nYou were looking for comfort in a stressful moment and went to someone with the most expertise you knew. That\u2019s understandable. \n\nTo his point of contacting him, in an emergency situation like this he\u2019s probably right that since neither of them are examining your mother, and EMTs are already involved, all either of them is likely to do is give you reassurances. Later, after the emergency is resolved Heather will be a great resource to talk about the care plan the doctor recommends.", "NTA.\n\nI think Christ is upset that you didn\u2019t call HIM to deal with the situation.", "Yes you were wrong to call her.  She is in training to be a cardiologist.  She is not a cardiologist.  You put her on the spot.", "INFO\n\nWhy did you call her instead of your son? That's kind of bizarre. Wouldn't he want to know his grandmother is going to the hospital?", "NTA, cardiology resident trumps RN. And more importantly, if Heather felt imposed upon by the phone call while you were waiting for the ambulance, she wouldn't have shown up at the hospital with Laura or been helpful to you. Residents are, by necessity, fiercely protective of their time and against people who they feel are taking advantage of their medical training. She chose to be there and to help. Chris sounds a little bit jealous.", "NTA\n\nYour son is a a point in life where he has more confidence than he has wisdom.\n\nHis opinion here is not relevant. His ADULT sister and her ADULT girlfriend were both ok with your actions.\n\nYou did not cross any lines. In your situation, I would have called her and any other cardiologist/med student I knew as even a passing acquaintance.\n\nYour son owes you an apology.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely get her a gift, but after calling for help, you called someone you knew would be able to help your family navigate the emergency. Heck of a 'welcome to the family', though!\n\nHope your mom is doing better.", "I know I'm in the minority but i think you're the AH because you don't know her well enough to put that kind of pressure on her. She's also not a member of the family yet, so again, this isn't her responsibility. If anything you should have called your daughter and have her talk to her girlfriend. YTA.", "NTA- sure, a little strange in a broad sense- but not really in the context of an emergency- your brain does weird stuff in those situations. \nAs long as she isn\u2019t upset about it, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much- \n\nChris probably freaked, on some level,  because your mom asking something of your partner is actually a big sign of commitment and this being a long-term relationship- he literally probably just panicked at the idea of \u201coh, she\u2019s sorta becoming part of my family life\u201d", "NAH. A sick parent trumps everything. You can apologize for possibly overstepping by taking everyone out for a meal.", "NTA but it's understandable that your son is upset, maybe a little bit of bruised ego? Glad your mum is well op", "NTA. As an RN, I\u2019m available at all times to my friends and family as a reference and resource. If it is beyond my scope, I refer them to someone else. It doesn\u2019t matter too much how long I\u2019ve known someone but if it was my gf\u2019s family? I\u2019d be there no question. I have no idea why OP\u2019s son thinks his opinion matters here.", "YtA\nUnless you had permission it might have been really inappropriate to call her. I would check with her to make sure she was comfortably with that type of call.", "NTA\n\nNow make certain to tell Heather how much you appreciated her being there.", "lol he\u2019s mad you didn\u2019t call him because of course your mom, his grandma, is family. And due to his medical profession, he probably wanted to use his expertise to help a family member. \n\nNTA- but definitely understand why he\u2019s upset/felt left out.", "I mean, yeah, considering Chris is an RN AND the grandson, probably should have called him first.  Heather was very nice to have come, but she's still in training, and RN's deal with everything!  I wouldn't say your an asshole, but next time call your son first!  Good luck!", "YTA\n\nYou were way inappropriate. You don\u2019t know her or anything about her. They\u2019ve been dating for all of 6 months. You don\u2019t know who she is as a person, let alone what kind of doctor she is.\n\nCalling your son was the only appropriate move. \n\nI don\u2019t even get why you have her number.", "YTA\n\nI think it\u2019s rude to use her as a medical resource when you just met.", "Wait, did you not call Chris to tell him that his grandmother was in the emergency room? That\u2019s why he\u2019s mad!", ">  Christ was pretty mad at me for calling Heather because he said meeting a person once isn't an indication to call them during an emergency. \n\n\nhe wasn't even the person being called???? or their partner???? i think he was jealous. NTA", "Did you call her to help you take care of your mom while you waited for the ambulance to arrive or did you just ask her to come to the hospital?", "NTA - I get that Chris would have wanted to know what's going on with his grandmother before his sister's gf, but your approach was appropriate for the occasion. You got on so well with Laura's gf that you felt comfortable calling her in this moment, and that's ideal! It also says a lot about her that she came to the hospital and helped so willingly. Chris can only hope his future partner is so awesome that they can be assimilated into the family so quickly.", "NTA. You called, after a ambulance, a person who might have useful knowledge about the situation. She came and helped. \n\nAssuming RN means registered Nurse, I can understand Chris being a little upset. Medical knowledge in the family is probably his domain, and it's being usurped by the new girlfriend. But specialist knowledge is better than general knowledge.", "When my mom was dying at home, the head nurse of our small town hospital had left a message with her phone number for me.  I was home alone with my mom when I needed an answer to a pretty minor situation, but I needed help and her number was there.\n\nWhen my aunt found out I'd called the nurse for something as simple as I had, she was mortified but it opened the door and the nurse dropped by my house twice a day for the next two weeks until my mom passed away.   She dropped in on her way to work and her way home and told me I was doing a great job.\n\nso NTA.  The only people who can tell you that you trespassed are your daughter and her girlfriend.  You could ask them later when the emergency is done if they were  comfortable with you having called, but ultimately you're fine.  You can't manage other people's emotions and concerns in an emergency or second guess yourself. What ever your son's problem is, it's his problem, not yours", "Not making a judgment, but doctors are generally not supposed to give medical advice outside the context of a doctor-patient relationship. Obviously some do and obvious stuff like \"drink water\" doesn't really qualify, but imagine if she suggested something and it backfired. Could be something like her not knowing your mom's medical history and giving inappropriate advice, or just everything went sideways and you blamed her out of emotion. These are just some specific examples, but you may have put her in an awkward situation where she felt like she couldn't say no. But you need to communicate with her and your daughter about whether this was the case or whether they were happy to give input. And if you were just calling for emotional support, that's inappropriate because her profession isn't relevant.", "Ah I'm gonna say YTA, just because in situations like that you put a lot of pressure on that person so in this case Heather, you met her once so say if she was busy or whatever, she's not gonna feel like she can say no etc plus you'd already rang an ambulance, Heather wasn't there so she couldn't of physically done more than the emergency services on the other end of the phone could.\nI get WHY you did, you was worried, but if Heather wasn't free she wasn't going to turn round and tell you that after meeting you 1 time was she? Like i said, it's a lot of pressure to put on someone who wants to make a good impression on their other half's family, it could be seen as a power move cos you know she'd want to impress.", "NTA. He's just being a butt. You did the absolutely right thing. And Heather sounds like a gem. A very nice thank you is certainly in order, which you already know and are planning.", "Christ", "NTA: it was a bit soon to call her only knowing her that short amount of time, but two things mitigate it: 1. it was absolutely an emergency and she was not a bad person to call for the specifics 2. she has been dating your daughter for half a year and was introduced to you, thus saying that it is serious.\n\nI would still apologize for involving her so early, but explainign that you panicked will hopefully smooth it over and honestly I would expect that she would understand given the severity of the situation.", "NTA, but I\u2019d totally get her a thank you gift. I also think you should talk with your son as he\u2019s obviously threatened by his sisters girlfriend", "The fact that Heather came to the hospital to check on your mother is huge! You\u2019ve got a good future daughter in law \ud83d\udc95", "NTA, but get her a thank you gift.", "NTA.  You were panicked and called the first person you thought of to help his GRANDMOTHER.  I would send her a nice thank you note with a gift.", "I think your son is more mad that you didn't call him as the oldest male in the family or something like that. And honestly it is a little surprising to me too, but not too crazy either", "YTA. Training to be something isn\u2019t being a cardiologist.

It's like if AI had to write a story as a Rubiks cube", "I had to reread this to realize that neither your daughter nor her partner seemed to mind.

Sounds like Chris is just pissed off you didn\u2019t call him instead. Maybe he\u2019s jealous he\u2019s not the most qualified medical professional in the family anymore.

Give her a lovely thank you and now take your daughter and girlfriend out to a nice meal and apologize for the sudden need and go over any future expectations.

OP, your son is just mad that you called a doctor before a nurse.", "Honestly Chris just sounds salty you didnt ask him for help lol NTA", "NTA. It sounds like Chris is upset because he's also a medical professional and wanted to be asked to help. But the thing is, family shouldn't need to keep their shit together in a metal crisis. He should be able to just be there and worry and cry like the rest of everyone. Heather was basically acting like a patient advocate and social worker - explaining what's going on, making sure the care plan is lining up right, stuff like that. Chris needed to exist in those moments as a member of your family, not as a medical professional who is part of the care team.", "NTA - I think he was probably just upset Laura got to be there (and Heather) instead of him! Just feeling a little butt hurt but nothing malicious.", "NTA- In the time of need you called the one person you know that could help you understand what might be medically going on with your mom. It would be completely different if you called her if you cut your hand that would be a bit inappropriate. \nFor your mom no way if anything it wasn\u2019t for you it was for your mom since they hit it off.", "Is son upset that you didn\u2019t call him because he\u2019s family or a nurse?

One of my best friends is a doctor and while she is annoyed by random people we went to high school with sending her pictures of various rashes and whatnot, she is always happy to give an opinion. In a serious situation like what happened with your mother Heather was likely happy to help. This is her partner's family. She knows that supporting you and your mother is supporting Laura. \n\nAlso, she's training to be a cardiologist\u2014it isn't like you were trying to circumvent going to the ER or get something for free.

There is a very good chance Heather would have come to the hospital with Laura anyway since they are partners and that is what partners do. I doubt you disturbed her at all, but a handwritten \"thank you\" note is always a classy move.", "NTA, I bet Heather was honored that you reached out to her in a time of need, I\u2019d definitely do something to thank her. Honestly I bet Chris just feels sad that you didn\u2019t call him first, which is understandable from an emotional standpoint, but you made the logical decision, which is the correct one in a medical emergency.", "Screw what Chris thinks. What do Heather and Laura think about the situation? I would personally feel honored if my SOs family felt comfortable enough to call me during an emergency.", "No you did perfectly fine.", "Your mom is okay and you did everything you could think of to make sure she was.

It's natural to consult all available resources.\n\n>should apologise for disturbing Heather or get her a thank you gift or something\n\nHonestly, yes, I would absolutely do both, just in case.  Can't hurt, just for the sake of keeping things amicable and making sure you don't offend Heather, and you continue getting along well with her and Laura.\n\nBut it kinda sounds like Chris is just jealous.  He's being kinda silly.  I mean, I assume you did call him too, after speaking with Heather (Laura too, if she wasn't with Heather).", "NAH. This is a personal preference thing. You weren\u2019t wrong for not knowing his preference, but now you do. I don\u2019t pick up when my in laws call, but some people do, just depends on how anti-triangulation you are. Buy her a gift card, and call him first next time.", "You can apologize for the inconvenience which is probably the classy thing to do.

Perhaps, you could invite her to a family dinner once your mother is out of hospital.", "NTA- You did what you thought was best.  And Heather was able to help you and get some experience!", "NTA I would have that conversation with Heather though and your daughter.   Thank her for the help, apologize for bothering her and crossing any boundaries.  Explain that you were just so stressed out about your mother and since she\u2019s training to be a cardiologist, you thought of her.

Kudos Mom!", "NTA\n\nYou felt comfortable reaching out to her at the time because you respect her knowledge and skills.

So glad your mum is okay and that your daughter has such a lovely girlfriend.", "I don\u2019t get why nobody is understanding Chris\u2019s side like it\u2019s good for their bonding with heather she would be feeling very good but just imagine that there\u2019s a particular criteria of things everybody in your family consults you about and then after meeting your siblings spouse once they shift to her/him all of a sudden.

Your son wishes he was your first call and 2, working in the medical field, they develop some internal mindsets of how things \"should be\" for how others behave with medical staff.\n\nIt's your mom, you panic, you called the person you most recently spoke to who's a cardiologist, that's a normal response. Don't beat yourself up about it.

Two reasons:\n\nA) absolutely handled the situation the right way.\n\n\nB) Chris sounds threatened or intimidated by Heather.", "NTA at all.

It was his grandmother, and you chose to call someone you met once before him (I do understand why you did it, but I also understand how hurt he must feel). \n\nHave you talked to your son afterwards? Not only was he not called as one of the first ones when his grandmother had an emergency, it\u2019s also somewhat in his field. So I\u2019m betting he\u2019s hurt. The scare of someone close to you being seriously ill also heightens all emotions and makes us be less logical and more emotional. \n\nSo give Heather a thank you gift. She\u2019s earned it. And take your son out to a dinner or spend some time with him. He probably felt displaced and almost replaced on top of almost losing a loved one.

Good luck navigating that.", "NTA tell Christ to fuck off", "Nta. After calling the ambulance You called someone with specialized knowledge regarding the issue.

It'll give her a chance to tell you if she was unbothered by your call for help.", "Your son is right.", "NTA but I think you should look into what Chris is feeling, it sounds a little like jealousy, especially because the girlfriend is also in medical training. When you're welcoming one kid's partner into the family, the other kid(s) might perceive them as competition, especially if you are skipping stages. Which is what happened here, because of the emergency. Take his feelings into account and you will have a happy family. Start acting like Heather is a sort of third kid in your family, and he will grow resentful of her.", "What? \nNTA - why is it up for judgement from Chris? Or is he a little hurt you chose a person you met once over him as an RN?\n\nI think check in with her absolutely and work to not just integrate her into every emergency.\n\nBut when I loved one goes down like that, you just scramble. And she stepped up.\n\nShe loves your daughter and it was her loves family. Probably not an ideal regular occurrence, like wouldn't bring her into regular ongoing care, but I can't see one off been a problem.", "NTA, but it was Chris\u2019s own grandma who was ill. I don\u2019t think you are an AH for calling her, but should consider why he is upset. He was clearly hurt by this.", "NTA. It would be slightly different if *Laura* was the one complaining since Heather is *her* girlfriend. Son should buzz off as it's none of his damn business. \n\nDefinitely get her a thank you gift for her help.", "NTA. It seems to me that Chris is a little hurt you didn\u2019t call him first, but it makes sense that you would contact someone with a background in cardiology.", "soft YTA.  If she stays in your daughter's life, are you going to call her every time someone in your family gets sick?  That's the vibe I'm getting from the fact that she was your FIRST CALL after meeting her ONCE.  Just because you met a doctor socially doesn't mean you're entitled to hit them anytime you have a medical concern.", "What's RN", "NTA. I bet Heather appreciated that you thought of her as a family and asked for help. And yes a thank you gift is great, but nothing to be mad about! If anything your daughter ITA for getting mad.", "NTA. in that situation I would have done the same", "Chris is mad because you called his sister's girlfriend instead of calling him or his sister. How is this not obvious to you? Yeah, he's trying to cover up his feelings by saying that you shouldn't have called Heather because it was rude. But really he's saying you shouldn't have called Heather because you should have called him. He's a medical professional too, you know. \n\nI don't think you're an AH on Heather's behalf, because obviously she didn't mind. But I do think you're a bit of an AH for not being more sensitive to your children who want to be more connected to you. I guess I'd say NAH in this particular circumstance, but if you make a habit of overlooking your children in favor of people you don't know very well, you're going to cross into Y T A territory pretty fast.", "NTA\n\nIf I've learned one thing from the ppl in my family that are in the medical field.. is that they go into the job because they live and breathe it and love to help and use their knowledge whenever possible.

The knowledge she has is so valuable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI would reach out to her and ask if she you calling made her uncomfortable..etc and if she says no than your son should feel ashamed.

If Heather was upset about it, your daughter would be the one to know/ask. It was a one time deal in an emergent situation, not like OP is asking for Heather's advice for every sniffle.

Sounds like Chris was stressed by the situation and maybe hurt not to have been the first call, so that\u2019s probably why he responded that way. \n\nAlso, idk how progressive the area you\u2019re in is, or what your family\u2019s comfort level is, but speaking purely as a queer person, this feels more like a very sweet inclusion of a significant other in the family than anything else.

So they might know each other as well as a straight couple 6 months in does.\n\nAs you said, some lesbians are picky, so when they find the one they just know.\n\nWomen tend to be (but are not always) more 'obsessive' in their relationships (obsessive isn't the right word, but I can't think of another), they want to know everything about someone and be with them all the time. Times that by 2 and they can get super attached very fast.\n\nObviously all these are generalizations. You'll get women that don't fit into any of these and date forever before moving in together.
