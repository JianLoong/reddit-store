I'd certainly get Heather a thank you gift, and proactively apologize just in case she was bothered.", "INFO: when you say training to be a cardiologist, do you mean she's in undergrad/medical school and hopes to be a cardiologist one day, or that she is already a doctor and is completing residency or fellowship?", "NTA\n\nBy 6 months I was engaged.  Other lesbians I know were married by 6 months.\n\nThere is even a joke that a lesbian will jump into a u-haul and move across the country a week after meeting someone.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nShe is practically family", "NTA.  Maybe Chris is just miffed that you didn't call him.", "NTA, cardiologist trumps a nurse in this case. Yes, it would have been better to call Laura and ask her to bring Heather, but in an emergency your brain doesn't always function rationally. I get that. Glad your mother is feeling better.\n\nEdited to fix familial relationship.", "NAH \n\nIt sounds like you were panicking and your brain jumped onto the nearest apparently logical person. You should speak to Heather and apologise for putting that kind of pressure on her, but I can't call anyone who went through that kind of scare an asshole.", "NTA- you were in a stressful situation, wanting help for your mom. So of course your mind is going to go straight to the person you think could help you.    Chris is just upset he wasn't called first, and might assume he knows more on the subject then what someone training to be a cardiologist would.  (usually that would mean Heather is already a dr going into the specialty of cardiology).\n\nAnyway,,  just get her a nice gift, thank her and tell her how great she will be in the professional with how she handled this. (since the patient /family side is a hard thing to learn)", "NTA, but call her again to thank her. Send them a restaurant gift certificate or something, flowers, who knows. \n\nKeep talking about it, all this crap becomes crap because all the talk stops.\n\nIt isn't always easy but you are building relationships all the time.\n\nKeep at it.", "NTA. I think she probably feels special that you called her. I would have. It sounds like maybe your son is hurt because you didn\u2019t call them first, which is understandable but you called someone who clearly cares about your family, as well.", "I'm going to go against the grain and say YTA.  Even though she is a doctor she's not your family's doctor nor have you established an actual relationship with her. She may have felt in a position where she couldn't say no since she's still new to your family.  Give her a gift to apologize and make a genuine effort to know her outside her profession.", "NAH\n\nBut it\u2019s a bit odd to call her directly when you don\u2019t really know her, and without knowing what you asked it may have been somewhat inappropriate to put her in the spot if she thought you were asking for free medical advice. \n\nIt would have made more sense to call your daughter and ask her to ask Heather if she would mind coming to the hospital to help put your mind at rest", "NAH.\n\nIt was an emergency situation and you panicked. You heard heart problems and called the person you connected with heart issues. If Heather doesn\u2019t mind then there no issue with that, and if there is an issue you should address it with Heather and Laura and not Chris.\n\nHowever, I will add that unless Heather has an affiliation with that hospital then there\u2019s nothing she could do for you that your son couldn\u2019t do. How far along is Heather in her training? Does Chris work at or have connections to the hospital where you took your mother?\n\nYour son is likely dealing with tons of emotions - you called someone your daughter is dating instead of calling your son first and you decided a doctor in training is better help than a licensed RN. I don\u2019t think those feelings are an excuse to lash out but I do see where they are coming from.", "YTA.  Reddit is wild.  A couple months ago a similar situation was posted but from the Dr POV asking if she's the AH for telling people to stop calling her and everyone was saying it's an AH move to call a Dr like that.  So now it's not an AH move?", "NTA\n\nChris is projecting. He was offended that you called Heather and not him, and is berating you about a different issue because saying what he is really feeling makes him look petty.\n\nBy all means, get Heather a thank you gift, as she was wonderful, and you should be nice. But you did nothing wrong.", "In my experience, doctors hate people who want to talk about medical symptoms in social settings, but are quite happy to provide support and translation (of specialist medical terms) in serious situations (like a cardiac event for an elderly person, as was the case here). In addition, hospital staff tend to pay more attention to a patient when there is a personal connection with a fellow hospital staff member or a physician with appropriate expertise; it\u2019s just a natural connection thing. Heather was probably thrilled to know she could get partner brownie points for helping out here. Chris just has his nose out of joint because he came second to a family newcomer.", "nta, you did what you thought was best.\n\nif you now feel guilty, buy Heather a gift, she'll appreciate it", "Jesus, Christ.", "Why is it any of Chris\u2019s business? Tell him to mind his own. \n\nNTA", "NTA. The fact you had her number means it's ok to use it I reckon :) I would ask ANYONE in my vicinity or phone contacts for advice if I were in your situation. \n\nHowever, if you tend to over involve yourself in your kids relationships, maybe think about that, but in this case it was justified. Don't call her for any lesser or any unnecessary things for a least a year and you should be good :)", "NAH. Chris is in the medical field so he knows how often people are hit up for medical advice by acquaintances and it\u2019s a common annoyance for doctors, nurses, etc. it sounds like he\u2019s looking out for Heather and it\u2019s kind of sweet. \n\nYou were looking for comfort in a stressful moment and went to someone with the most expertise you knew. That\u2019s understandable. \n\nTo his point of contacting him, in an emergency situation like this he\u2019s probably right that since neither of them are examining your mother, and EMTs are already involved, all either of them is likely to do is give you reassurances. Later, after the emergency is resolved Heather will be a great resource to talk about the care plan the doctor recommends.", "NTA.\n\nI think Christ is upset that you didn\u2019t call HIM to deal with the situation.", "Yes you were wrong to call her.  She is in training to be a cardiologist.  She is not a cardiologist.  You put her on the spot.", "INFO\n\nWhy did you call her instead of your son? That's kind of bizarre. Wouldn't he want to know his grandmother is going to the hospital?", "NTA, cardiology resident trumps RN. And more importantly, if Heather felt imposed upon by the phone call while you were waiting for the ambulance, she wouldn't have shown up at the hospital with Laura or been helpful to you. Residents are, by necessity, fiercely protective of their time and against people who they feel are taking advantage of their medical training. She chose to be there and to help. Chris sounds a little bit jealous.", "NTA\n\nYour son is a a point in life where he has more confidence than he has wisdom.\n\nHis opinion here is not relevant. His ADULT sister and her ADULT girlfriend were both ok with your actions.\n\nYou did not cross any lines. In your situation, I would have called her and any other cardiologist/med student I knew as even a passing acquaintance.\n\nYour son owes you an apology.", "NTA\n\nAbsolutely get her a gift, but after calling for help, you called someone you knew would be able to help your family navigate the emergency. Heck of a 'welcome to the family', though!\n\nHope your mom is doing better.", "I know I'm in the minority but i think you're the AH because you don't know her well enough to put that kind of pressure on her. She's also not a member of the family yet, so again, this isn't her responsibility. If anything you should have called your daughter and have her talk to her girlfriend. YTA.", "NTA- sure, a little strange in a broad sense- but not really in the context of an emergency- your brain does weird stuff in those situations. \nAs long as she isn\u2019t upset about it, I wouldn\u2019t worry too much- \n\nChris probably freaked, on some level,  because your mom asking something of your partner is actually a big sign of commitment and this being a long-term relationship- he literally probably just panicked at the idea of \u201coh, she\u2019s sorta becoming part of my family life\u201d", "NAH. A sick parent trumps everything. You can apologize for possibly overstepping by taking everyone out for a meal.", "NTA but it's understandable that your son is upset, maybe a little bit of bruised ego? Glad your mum is well op", "NTA. As an RN, I\u2019m available at all times to my friends and family as a reference and resource. If it is beyond my scope, I refer them to someone else. It doesn\u2019t matter too much how long I\u2019ve known someone but if it was my gf\u2019s family? I\u2019d be there no question. I have no idea why OP\u2019s son thinks his opinion matters here.", "YtA\nUnless you had permission it might have been really inappropriate to call her. I would check with her to make sure she was comfortably with that type of call.", "NTA\n\nNow make certain to tell Heather how much you appreciated her being there.", "lol he\u2019s mad you didn\u2019t call him because of course your mom, his grandma, is family. And due to his medical profession, he probably wanted to use his expertise to help a family member. \n\nNTA- but definitely understand why he\u2019s upset/felt left out.", "I mean, yeah, considering Chris is an RN AND the grandson, probably should have called him first.  Heather was very nice to have come, but she's still in training, and RN's deal with everything!  I wouldn't say your an asshole, but next time call your son first!  Good luck!", "YTA\n\nYou were way inappropriate. You don\u2019t know her or anything about her. They\u2019ve been dating for all of 6 months. You don\u2019t know who she is as a person, let alone what kind of doctor she is.\n\nCalling your son was the only appropriate move. \n\nI don\u2019t even get why you have her number.", "YTA\n\nI think it\u2019s rude to use her as a medical resource when you just met.", "Wait, did you not call Chris to tell him that his grandmother was in the emergency room? That\u2019s why he\u2019s mad!", ">  Christ was pretty mad at me for calling Heather because he said meeting a person once isn't an indication to call them during an emergency. \n\n\nhe wasn't even the person being called???? or their partner???? i think he was jealous. NTA", "Did you call her to help you take care of your mom while you waited for the ambulance to arrive or did you just ask her to come to the hospital?", "NTA - I get that Chris would have wanted to know what's going on with his grandmother before his sister's gf, but your approach was appropriate for the occasion. You got on so well with Laura's gf that you felt comfortable calling her in this moment, and that's ideal! It also says a lot about her that she came to the hospital and helped so willingly. Chris can only hope his future partner is so awesome that they can be assimilated into the family so quickly.", "NTA. You called, after a ambulance, a person who might have useful knowledge about the situation. She came and helped. \n\nAssuming RN means registered Nurse, I can understand Chris being a little upset. Medical knowledge in the family is probably his domain, and it's being usurped by the new girlfriend. But specialist knowledge is better than general knowledge.", "When my mom was dying at home, the head nurse of our small town hospital had left a message with her phone number for me.  I was home alone with my mom when I needed an answer to a pretty minor situation, but I needed help and her number was there.\n\nWhen my aunt found out I'd called the nurse for something as simple as I had, she was mortified but it opened the door and the nurse dropped by my house twice a day for the next two weeks until my mom passed away.   She dropped in on her way to work and her way home and told me I was doing a great job.\n\nso NTA.  The only people who can tell you that you trespassed are your daughter and her girlfriend.  You could ask them later when the emergency is done if they were  comfortable with you having called, but ultimately you're fine.  You can't manage other people's emotions and concerns in an emergency or second guess yourself. What ever your son's problem is, it's his problem, not yours", "Not making a judgment, but doctors are generally not supposed to give medical advice outside the context of a doctor-patient relationship. Obviously some do and obvious stuff like \"drink water\" doesn't really qualify, but imagine if she suggested something and it backfired. Could be something like her not knowing your mom's medical history and giving inappropriate advice, or just everything went sideways and you blamed her out of emotion. These are just some specific examples, but you may have put her in an awkward situation where she felt like she couldn't say no. But you need to communicate with her and your daughter about whether this was the case or whether they were happy to give input. And if you were just calling for emotional support, that's inappropriate because her profession isn't relevant.", "Ah I'm gonna say YTA, just because in situations like that you put a lot of pressure on that person so in this case Heather, you met her once so say if she was busy or whatever, she's not gonna feel like she can say no etc plus you'd already rang an ambulance, Heather wasn't there so she couldn't of physically done more than the emergency services on the other end of the phone could.\nI get WHY you did, you was worried, but if Heather wasn't free she wasn't going to turn round and tell you that after meeting you 1 time was she? Like i said, it's a lot of pressure to put on someone who wants to make a good impression on their other half's family, it could be seen as a power move cos you know she'd want to impress.", "NTA. He's just being a butt. You did the absolutely right thing. And Heather sounds like a gem. A very nice thank you is certainly in order, which you already know and are planning.", "Christ", "NTA: it was a bit soon to call her only knowing her that short amount of time, but two things mitigate it: 1. it was absolutely an emergency and she was not a bad person to call for the specifics 2. she has been dating your daughter for half a year and was introduced to you, thus saying that it is serious.\n\nI would still apologize for involving her so early, but explainign that you panicked will hopefully smooth it over and honestly I would expect that she would understand given the severity of the situation.", "NTA, but I\u2019d totally get her a thank you gift. I also think you should talk with your son as he\u2019s obviously threatened by his sisters girlfriend", "The fact that Heather came to the hospital to check on your mother is huge! You\u2019ve got a good future daughter in law \ud83d\udc95", "NTA, but get her a thank you gift.", "NTA.  You were panicked and called the first person you thought of to help his GRANDMOTHER.  I would send her a nice thank you note with a gift.", "I think your son is more mad that you didn't call him as the oldest male in the family or something like that. And honestly it is a little surprising to me too, but not too crazy either", "YTA. Training to be something isn\u2019t being a cardiologist.

It's like if AI had to write a story as a Rubiks cube", "I had to reread this to realize that neither your daughter nor her partner seemed to mind.

I guarantee she felt honoured and appreciated. This 1000% made her feel welcomed in a way it would have taken years otherwise.

It\u2019s so hard to be accepted by your partners family as a gay person. And especially when you already had some bad experiences, this means so so much. \n\nAnd tell your son that you may have only met her twice now, and Laura is only dating her for 6 months, but those are things that bring you closer and to you she is already family.

How much does she wants to be involved already? Does she feel comfortable with being as involved as you made her? Tell her you don\u2019t want to stress her out or whatever, you just want to have a respectful base and don\u2019t make her feel pressured or that you expect things from her. \n\nAll in all you sound like a fantastic MIL, if to her or your sons partner, or whomever they marry (I\u2019m here swinging my \u201cHeather flag\u201d)\n\nDon\u2019t stress yourself, talk to Laura about it and tell her you\u2019d like have a talk with Heather, give her a fair warning what you want to talk about, then go for it.", "moving truck on the second date right?", "Lesbian couples also have higher divorce rates than straight or gay couples, so perhaps 6 months isn't enough time for nearly as many couples as it seems.", "I don't see what any of that has to actually do with this.

My first instinct was to call her because my mom was showing heart attack symptoms and she is a cardiologist", "I feel that Heather couldn't exactly say no without it becoming weird since the mom didn't even bother to call her girlfriend.", "Agreed. In addition, OP 's mother is not Heather's patient. She shouldn't be asking her to give medical advice or care to someone who is not her patient.

You took your mother to the hospital where a licensed team of medical professionals screened & treated her.

Bottom line, you overstepped in phoning her.\nAlso understand Son's unhappiness in you choosing trainee cardiologist GF over your RN child. He likely was hurt that you called in a near-stranger (sorry, it's true) for essentially emotional support. May also appear that you're more impressed w/her trainee cardiologist status than his RN degree.

You reached out to the most qualified person in an emergency and you've heard nothing from Laura or Heather indicating she was uncomfortable.\n\nChris might be used to people asking him for medical opinions and protecting Heather proactively or he might be jealous of Heather's qualifications.

To echo others here and provide perspective: I LOVED when my now MIL called me to talk through something \u201cbecause she needed a safe place to talk it through.\u201d I am not a counselor, but my job does require a lot of one on one convos and she knows a lot of my clients use me as a soundboard, and she knows any advice or thoughts I would share are coming with no strings or agenda.\n\nYou sought her out because you knew your mom trusted and liked her, and more than that, she is familiar with the process y\u2019all were facing, but I am sure it was very scary and daunting. It would be absolutely lovely for you to write her a thank you card and a small treat for her taking the time to step in, but I am sure she was absolutely thrilled to be trusted with that role so quickly.\n\nI am sure you could say something to the effect that you are grateful she was there for y\u2019all, and you hope that you never have to reach out like that again and apologize that it was out of the blue and I am sure she would respond that it was her pleasure to be there to help take some stress off y\u2019all as a friendly presence and a professional go between for you and your mom and your moms med staff.", "NTA!! You are also definitely not the first or last person to do this in Heathers life- pretty standard to call a medical expert you personally know when something scary like this happens!", "Wait so neither Heather Nor Laura complained, Chris did? I\u2019d ignore him. Well, I mean, a thank you gift never hurt anybody but it seems more like jealousy than anything else.", "Sounds like maybe your son is hurt that you called the physician girlfriend in the family and not him.

You think he can't determine that?", "Oh I read it wrong, I was thinking the RN was dating the cardiologist, thought she was his GF- yeah that\u2019s fucking weird lol", "Are you serious?", "got it!  still, family should come first - and Heather just entered the picture.....I mean I still wouldn't call her an asshole for calling her, I just think it's weird that she was the first person she called.", "OP might be TA if Heather voiced discomfort and OP pushed back on it, but otherwise there was nothing wrong with asking.

No disrespect against nurses, but why the fuck would anyone call an RN in a cardiac emergency?", "Chris is salty family went to someone else for medical advice.", "And Heather is more qualified than Chris in this area of medicine.

In this case it was reasonable, as she got along very well with everyone, but the average speed of that happening with lesbians versus straight people or whatever doesn't really matter here.", "Probably because her mom might have been dying in front of her and she was seeking a trusted expert (and likely someone she knew cared) to make her feel better?

Gay male couples actually have slightly lower divorce rates than straight couples, and lesbian couples have an extremely high divorce rate compared to either of them.
