Or tell her you\u2019d love to go to a veg restaurant another time, just the two of you. \n\nI have dietary restrictions that can be difficult in restaurants but I would never put them on someone else, esp on their birthday. It would be different if I was going one on one with a friend, I might say something then. But not on a group dinner. Veganism is an extremely limiting diet and one can\u2019t expect to be catered to.", "Ugh then why can\u2019t she eat something before? Vegan is a choice, and not your choice. It\u2019s your Birthday not hers.  NTA. Go eat where you want.", "Definitely NTA, she is an AH. Bottom line, you should get to choose the location of your birthday dinner.", "Does the restaurant have salads where meat and cheese can be left off?   Perhaps call the restaurant and talk to a manager and explain that you will have a vegan in your party and ask if there is a dish that chef can make to accommodate her.", "NTA. And her reaction solidifies my verdict.", "What do you mean it sounds incredibly childish? It\u2019s your birthday so you have the absolute right to choose where and what you want to eat. Of course you should try to be considerate of her, but also her lifestyle choices shouldn\u2019t hold you to ransom, especially on your birthday. Especially when she only recommends vegan restaurants and doesn\u2019t try to accommodate you or anyone else in her suggestions: honestly it just sounds like she\u2019s trying to manipulate you emotionally into becoming a vegan. \n\nAlso, she kind of sounds like an asshole actually. Guilt tripping you and insulting you for \u201cnot accommodating\u201d her on your birthday when she was deliberately suggesting 100% vegan restaurants. Pot calling the kettle black.\n\nAnd as others have said, it\u2019s not a shellfish or nut allergy - veganism is a lifestyle choice. She can eat something else before and come and join you for the company, or just sulk at home. Whichever she chooses will speak volumes about what kind of person she is.", "NTA. It's your birthday, she can take one day off from every single thing being focused on her needs. She can eat before or after and come to celebrate you, or she can just stay home.", "NTA - its YOUR choice where you want to go as it is your party/event. You even asked her to recommend restaurants that fill both yours and your aunts desires and she couldnt come up with anything.\n\n>She\u2019s extremely upset and hurt, called me an immature prat who is prejudiced against vegans and said that if I didn\u2019t want her there then I just shouldn\u2019t have invited her, that I didn\u2019t have to play games with to make her feel unwelcome. \n\nThe way she responded should tell you everything you need to know about the whole situation. It was you who tried to compromise to include her but she failed to deliver, I guess because she actually didnt want to compromise but wanted you to make it her way. No offense to her, but that reaction is one of the main reasons why vegans are meme'd on so much.", "NTA\n\nIt does not sound incredibly childish and you are not an immature prat.\n\nIt\u2019s your birthday, your favourite restaurant, your choice. Just like it would be for hers. The insults are just nasty. Ignore her and have a lovely time.", "NTA as it is your birthday. Celebrate it the way you want.\n\nWITH Blanquette de veau with a couple of glasses of white Burgundy and a sabayon for dessert, \n\nYour aunt cannot be serious that she wants you to change restaurant for 1 person?? Hell no", "NTA. As a vegan, we don't like the unreasonable aunts who give being vegan a bad name. I don't think it's that childish to want a meal you like at a favorite restaurant on your birthday. Clearly she shouldn't have blown up at you, especially after you attempted to accommodate her. Also, good to know about French wines.\n\nHowever, for all those saying she could find something to eat anywhere - no she can't. There are plenty of restaurants in the middle of the greens to guts spectrum, but I've been on the wrong end where even sides of vegetables are cooked in butter. It really does suck to get dragged to a steakhouse or the like and not be able to get any actual sustenance. And I hate the annoyed attention that trying to get a specially modified meal garners. But of course, that wasn't the case here.", "NTA, but it\u2019s a shame there isn\u2019t a restaurant that has things you can both enjoy. I\u2019ve been dragged to many a steakhouse where I ate a side salad as even the veg had bacon etc and it sucks; however, I do think you should get to have what you like at your birthday party. \n\nPerhaps you could go for dessert after to a place she could join?", "NTA - It's your birthday dinner, so it should be at a place that you would enjoy. There is a difference between vegan dishes and vegan options. She can order a salad if she wants to participate in your birthday dinner. She does not need to be accommodated with a vegan take on chicken tikka masala. \n\nThat said, I would bet a large amount of money that the reason she is unable to find an acceptable place for her to eat that isn't a 100% vegan restaurant is that she does not want to be around non-vegan food but doesn't have the courage to say that. That's what is immature, and that shows her prejudice. Often the things that people lash out and call you are what they understand deep down is their issue and error.  \n\nSadly, your aunt is acting like the vegan stereotype, which is not a good thing. She seems insufferable.\n\nHappy Birthday", "NTA. Unless you're planning to eat in a literal meat processing plant, there *will* be vegan options for your aunt. You tried to accommodate her dietary preferences by letting her have a say in where you ate, & she took advantage of that by only offering 100% Vegan Only restaurants, which doesn't accommodate what *you* want. Your aunt is the sort of vegan who is the reason so many people hate vegans: judgmental, preachy, & always trying to play the victim when everything isn't precisely tailored to her desires.", "NTA - your birthday, your rules. If the restaurant does have vegetarian options, just ask the server if whatever ingredient that makes it non-vegan can be omitted. It's quite obvious that she is trying to push her diet on you with her suggestions, and that's not cool.", "NTA.\n\nThe way she responded to your birthday wish and insulted you says A LOT about her.\n\nYou can always eat vegan at a restaurant, even if there aren\u2019t specifically vegan options. It\u2018s your birthday, not hers!", "NTA - your birthday; your choice. She appears to be the sort of vegan who really gives vegans a bad name", "Your birthday, your rules. NTA. Tell her She\u2019s welcome to come as long as she doesn\u2019t spend the entire meal harping on the lack of vegan options.", "NTA. It\u2019s YOUR birthday. You get to choose the place and if someone doesn\u2019t like that, that\u2019s on them! \nThe \u201cimmature prat\u201d part was completely unnecessary. I\u2019d be petty and write back \u201cwell, you can always buy a vegan plate from a different restaurant and bring it with you\u201d. That way she can\u2019t claim that you\u2019re not trying.", "NTA your bday so your choice it sucks for her that she doesn't have an alternative in that shop,but it sucks from her that she then just purely vegan Restaurants recommends", "NTA! She\u2019s trying to convert you!\n\nAlso it is your birthday! That doesn\u2019t sound childish at all.", "NTA. As someone who was vegetarian for 20-odd years, and now vegan almost a decade, this is YOUR birthday, and you should eat where you want. As someone who has been in this situation before, I would either eat all the side dishes on the menu  or ate beforehand.  Or I asked if I could have a dish \"veganized\". Not once have I played the \"you're excluding me\" card. Aunt sounds very controlling and selfish.", "NTA.\n\nIt's your birthday, it's your choice. I'm always amazed by how many people think that they should be accommodated all the time. But if you want to keep the peace, maybe invite that aunt out to one of her favorite vegan spots another time.", "NTA\n\nI'm sure she can find something to eat there.\n\nWhen you have a restrictive diet, you have to be a bit more compromising with people.", "NTA.\n\nA lot of restaurants have vegetarian options, but very few have vegan ones. And that is very annoying when you are invited somewhere. Even if you can eat something at home before, you still end up sitting there watching everyone else eat. Finding a restaurant that accommodates all guests is tough, so asking the aunt for recommendations was a smart move. She messed up, though, by only suggesting 100% vegan restaurants. And her response afterwards makes her TA.\n\nMaybe you could call your chosen restaurant and ask them for a vegan option? If asked beforehand, restaurants are often able to accommodate different diets.", "NTA for your birthday choices.\nYTA for your meal choices. Veal is inhumane.", "NTA for the restaurant selection situation but you seriously should research how veal is created and what all farmed animals are forced to endure because you like how they taste. Your aunt is being a histrionic asshole but at least she isn\u2019t abusing animals.", "NTA because it\u2019s your birthday dinner and you can choose. But why invite someone who is vegan if you were not going to be willing to accommodate their preferences for the meals. \n\nSoft y-t-a for that. \n\nMy daughter is vegan and unless a restaurant has specifically vegan options she\u2019s stuck eating dry bread and side salads. Which is not an enjoyable dining experience when out at a fancy restaurant. \n\nAnd like do you yourself never eat fruit or vegetables not soaked in butter or milk. Because your comment about being as \u201cfar from vegan as possible\u201d makes me think you\u2019re eating nothing but milk and dairy and that\u2019s just unhealthy.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

You would have been reasonable just to say this is a special birthday dinner for you and you want to go somewhere specific.

Go enjoy the meal you find delicious.", "NTA, it's your birthday and you were open to her making a suggestion. Instead she went with suggestions that didn't take your preferences into consideration. It's easy to convert a vegetarian salad into a vegan one. On request, most restaurants will not add cheese to that salad or swap out the dairy based dressing for a vinaigrette. There might be appetizers she could combine into a meal. She can also fill up before hand if there truly is nothing, for the sake of an omnivore's bday.", "NTA. It's your birthday and your choice. You were open to her suggestions but she only recommended restaurants that only had vegan options. That didn't sound like excluding to me.", "NTA. She had a chance to recommend a compromise option, but instead she recommended places that cater entirely to her veganism.

I would eat before or after an event and enjoy socializing with my friends and family.", "Most definitely NTA. Your aunt is behaving selfishly, not to mention immature and petty. It\u2019s YOUR birthday; the celebration is about YOU.

Worse they can do is say no.  Your aunt is acting entitled.  It is your birthday.  You are attempting to accommodate her, she is not providing you with reasonable options.", "NTA. It\u2019s your birthday not hers.  Tell her to put tofu in her purse and eat that.

It may be the same case with her, she thinks that eating meat is wrong and probably disgusting so I would not be surprised if she just didn\u2019t want to see it.", "I don\u2019t really understand the difference between eating veal and eating steak from a moral perspective, either way an animal is dying and I\u2019m sure that it would prefer not to do that.

I would be more concerned about the conditions of the human being workers at the abattoir as a moral issue. Also a lot of these things that people are bringing up are in America which is far away from where I live. If I had a problem with any sort of meat eating I wouldn\u2019t eat meat but I don\u2019t, even when it comes to people eating cats it\u2019s something that I find personally disgusting but in the way that I find tequila and hot red peppers or tartare disgusting, not in the way that I find mistreating workers or war disgusting.", "[deleted]", "None of the restaurants that I really like have many vegan options I like French cuisine which at the very least is very heavy on butter and eggs and things.

Traditionally, veal calves are kept in a crate so small they can hardly move (banned in Europe in 2007), so that\u2019s what people tend to think of when they think of veal, and the old way of doing it was quite inhumane.", "I mean true but it is bad manners to invite someone to a place you know they cant eat anything at...?!", "I mean I get that but did you even search for french restaurants with vegan options?\nAnd also you knew she was vegan and still invited her to a place you knew she couldnt eat at.. she's right it would have been better to tell her that youd love for her to come but she cant eat so not this time", "I can understand that I suppose, the smell of curry powder and Asian spices is quite unpleasant to me so I prefer to not stay at the table when people are eating takeaway, I\u2019ll do it to be polite but I\u2019ll keep my nose in my drink as much as possible so that all that I smell is beer. If she just said that she finds being around eating meat disgusting I would appreciate the honesty, I don\u2019t know how she would have been accommodated but I would go with her alone or with my brother who or an adventurous eater to a vegan restaurant another time.", "That's fine, they should not go to places where meat is served and excuse themselves from events that are at those places.", "Even beef cows are killed before the age of 2 and in this country the keeping the calf immobile thing isn\u2019t done. That seems unnecessary, a lot of times being unnecessarily cruel makes things taste worse like grain fed beef is strange tasting and hens that are kept in cages and not allowed to eat normal chicken things from the dirt have nasty eggs but I think that it\u2019s arbitrary to really care about the feelings of something that you\u2019re going to have killed for you to eat.", "I don\u2019t know about how things are in America but that sort of thing isn\u2019t allowed in Britain or the EU, they\u2019re just baby cows that haven\u2019t been weaned yet.", "Veal cages were outlawed in the EU, but the lack of bedding (they\u2019re raised on wood or concrete slatted floors) and low dietary fiber does still happen in some places, unfortunately.  So the worst, most inhumane practices were outlawed, as I mentioned, but some not-good practices still remain.  Some places do better than others; for example, Germany requires the floors be soft (rubber or straw), which is healthier and more comfortable for calves.\n\nThe industry as a whole has improved in Europe over what many Americans think of when they think of veal (it\u2019s not common to eat here, and the image of the poor caged babies is a persistent one), but it still does have issues in parts of the EU."]}
