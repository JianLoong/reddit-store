They're just as bad.", "Again, her parents being garbage prove to you she's adult enough to go solo. Maybe there's other things she didn't disclose she could've done but neglected to explore because shes \"grown\"", "I imagine I might make similar choices as you have if that time ever comes. I'm not going to abandon my kinds, though I will always maintain expectations.", "Wish that worked for my brother, both laying down the law and kicking him out just made him more of an ass.", "I\u2019ve been back with my parents since late 2019. In the process of getting everything straightened out, I\u2019ve had a new series of medical issues that have left me with 2 separate medical leave periods from work (currently I am in one now). While there are times I wish I didn\u2019t have to live with my parents, being able to have help while dealing with health challenges is the best thing.", "Especially in the economic times we live in now.\n\nBut it's a valid point. We can guide our children and point them in the right direction, but after a point, they have responsibility for their own choices.", "Don't forget the unspoken expectation that said child(ren) will come back to take care of them as their retirement looms because these poor excuses of parents \"raised\" them.", "Boop!", "You really shouldn't tell people this, it reads as \"evil stepmother.\" You were fed up with the disrespect and the \"sass?\" Please.", "As a parent myself who's been raising a child full-time as a single parent my entire life - some people aren't meant to be parents. Case and point here. What you wrote is disturbing on all levels. \n\nYou're supposed to be the adult who shows patience, composure, and stability - not stooping to their level. Whats even more telling about you is how you add in the quip trying to justify your actions. As I'm sure you were completely innocent in everything.", "The people criticizing you likely have not had to parent a out of control child. It's easy to pass judgment on other people as an armchair quarterback. The reality is parenting can be very hard and there is no hard coded Manual for how to take care of every situation. \n\nAt 18, she may have been a older child, but she still had the faculties to make her own choices. And her choices were destructive to you and to her. You made the choice you needed to in order to protect yourself and your family. The fact that your daughter got her shit together afterwards is evidence you made the right decision. Tough love is sometimes necessary. It's tough. Not just for the kid. \n\nThe people who think discipline and holding your kids to standards of reasonable behavior is some kind of child abuse are a big reason why kid behavior is so out of control these days. Kids need boundaries and consequences for crossing them. It teaches them how to interact with the world in a productive way and that negative actions often have negative consequences. Better to learn that lesson early.\n\nDon't feel defensive. You did what you needed to and your daughter benefitted from you putting your foot down.", "You did what you could do,; sometimes it's never enough. Sometimes smashing into the concrete wall of tough love is the only way younger people can learn humility and respect.  So if all of what you say is the truth, good on you.  It's never easy to be resolute and lay down the law, unequivocally and unemotionally, especially with someone you love, but at times it is necessary.", "I\u2019ve been reading all of your comments and i believe the reason that people are criticizing you so hard is because you\u2019re putting ALL of the issues on your pregnant child and failing to recognize your part in parenting that child. I personally think it\u2019s disgusting and if a child can\u2019t successfully and appropriately live with their PARENT, how the hell do you expect them to survive on their own?", "We paid for her prenatal appointments for the entire time she lived with us.  \n\nShe broke into the house afterward and stole some items I had purchased for the baby, because she felt entitled to them.", "What exactly was she supposed to do, get on her knees and beg her mom to care more about her than a new office? They were going to kick her out. She secured herself a place to stay. Not in a studio apartment by herself in the shitty part of town but in a home with parents who actually want her. Would you prefer that she lived on the streets? \n\nI mean, I guess she could live in her parents yard, but that's really only slightly better than the streets. You seem really determined to demonize this kid for choosing safety.\n\nYou're also being unrealistic. As much as it sucks, once your kid is eighteen, you are well within your rights to kick them out. It's legal. Nobody can do anything about that.", "See you actually care about your children.\n\nOP wishes she had parents like you.", "Really? Kicking him out didn't make him a better son? I'm shocked!", "Thing about being a parent is you don't really control your kinds. You can guide them but at some point, the kids need to take responsibility for themselves and may their own life choices. If they make bad ones, it's not always the fault if the parents.", "I\u2019m glad you\u2019re perfect and have it all figured out all by yourself with no help.\n\nActions have consequences and everyone has a limit.  How long am I supposed to tolerate being treated like garbage by a child in my own home?", "She was 18 and 5 months pregnant. Let me repeat that - 18 and 5 months pregnant. She's practically a child having a baby with nothing figured out, scared, and not knowing how her life was going to turn out.\n\nAre you surprised someone in that position might be lashing out? Ffs put yourself in her shoes and ask how you'd have felt in that situation. You were the adult in the situation, and you failed at being an adult.", "It was her home too.", "I was in her shoes.  I gave birth at 18 too. If I had treated my parents the way she treated me, I would have had to pick myself up off the floor before I was out on my ass.", "She speaks of abuse, aggression and such. Sorry but you dont know shit about her situation. Your behind your high horse telling her she shoulda let her daughter be violent and aggressive towards her. At least she respected herself.\n\nI was an aggressive young man when I was 18 and my parents woulda been 100% in their right to kick me out. I was direspectful, entitled, violent... Funnily enough I decided to opt out and my dad tried as hard as he could for me to stay in the family home even if we fought and yell at eachother several times EVERY single day. \n\nDistance and time really helped our relationship. 11 years later my dad and I agree that moving out was the right call. We now have a relationship based on respect and trust.", "yeah I'm just going to stop you right there.. 18 may be a child in your book but in society's eyes... can can go to war, she can go to college, she can be sentences to life in prison..she's not a child anymore.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTHAT being said.. it is the parents role to prepare their children for when this time comes.", "and that would also have been wrong.  Your stepdaughter was a child.  a child who's brain and endocrine system had not finished deveoping.  Ok, she is rude and disrespectful.  the consequences for disrespect and sass should not be homelessness.  So what if she gave her dad an ultimatum?  What exactly was she going to do if he chose you and did not kick her out?  You sound a LOT like my step mother.  She kicked me out onto the streets.  I was a disrespectful asshole but not violent or anything.  When my father died, I seriously considered having her thrown out on the streets, instead of signing away my rights to a third of my father's house. All I am saying here is that If she holds a grudge and decides to treat you as  you treated her, you have it coming.", ">I would have had to pick myself up off the floor before I was out on my ass.\n\nYour parents would have beat you?", "How about no? Because you know just as much about the situation as I do right? But yet you come riding in on an even higher horse (ironic you say I'm on a high horse) spouting this holier than thou nonsense... Did you read your post before posting?\n\nThe girl was 18 AND 5 MONTHS PREGNANT. Get off your ignorant high horse already."]}
