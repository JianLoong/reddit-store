Let's call the best friend John.  He doesn't have a job, so he doesn't contribute to rent/expenses or anything which is fine we knew what we were getting into.  I also recently became unemployed so since my husband is the only one bringing in money, I help out around the house as much as possible.  This entails cleaning the house, taking out the trash, doing the laundry and cooking  meals for the three of us.  The only responsibility we expect of John is to clean the main bathroom once and a while and do the dishes.\n\nAdditional context in case you were wondering, we're moving across the country in two months, which isn't enough time to warrant me getting a permanent job where we live now.\n\nWell, last night my husband approached me saying that John would like to rotate dish duty between the three of us.  (I've already expressed to my husband that I don't expect him to do much of anything around the house given there are two unemployed people that can take care of that).  I told him that's fine, but if we're going to rotate that chore then we need to at least rotate the cooking between John and I as well because otherwise it is unfair of them to ask me to do dishes on top of everything else when John doesn't have any other responsibilities.\n\nJohn doesn't know how to cook which is why my husband explained that we can't rotate that.  I've offered several times that if he ever wants to learn to cook, he can help me make dinner.  He hasn't taken me up on the offer even once.  It seems like John is just trying to worm his way out of doing anything and I don't think my husband can see it because of their friendship.  Not to mention, I feel extraordinarily disrespected that my husband would even ask this of me because of how unfair it would be for me to do this on top of everything else.  I feel like John is trying to take advantage of me and my husband is going along with it.  I hate living in my own home, please help.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: I saw a lot of people asking about what's going to happen when we move and to answer that he will be living with us for the next three years while him and my husband are in school (both of them will be receiving a housing allowance from school at that point so financially he will be able to contribute) but yeah three years is how long he's staying with us", "created_utc": 1667907137, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ypjf39/aita_for_refusing_to_rotate_dish_duty_with_my/", "score": 240, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.
