I (23F) have 2 babies, a 1 year old and a 1 month old, and moved across the country a few years ago. There\u2019s been a lot going on for my parents the last year, so they haven\u2019t had the chance to make it up here and meet either of my kids. \n My parents (49F and 47M) have been together for almost 3 decades, and I have a really good and healthy relationship with my mom, but I haven\u2019t had a stable relationship with my dad since I was a child. He was unpredictable and abusive pretty much up until I moved out a week after I turned 18. Despite all of that, I\u2019ve put a lot of effort into trying to mend our relationship the last 2 years, for the sake of my mom (she really hates conflict and feeling caught in the middle). \n \n Last year, around Thanksgiving, we all discovered my dad was having an emotional affair online with someone who (obviously) turned out to be a con. The main issue is that this person was under the alias of a man. My mom almost left him, but they both agreed to try counseling, they moved away and everything was going good for a while; he seemed like he was actually trying to fix his relationship, not only with my mom but with his kids\u2026. Until I got a call a week ago from my mom saying her and my dad were separating and he was leaving her for a 25 year old man. On top of all that, it had also come out that there were multiple physical affairs with multiple guys all of ages ranging from 18-21 while they were attending counseling, one of the guys being a senior in high school. So my mom had to uproot her life, and my younger siblings\u2019 lives. Again. It\u2019s not even just about him leaving her, I guess you can\u2019t help who you\u2019re attracted to, it\u2019s the way he\u2019s handling it and how terribly he\u2019s treating my mom. He\u2019s acting as if it\u2019s her fault, rubbing his new relationship in her face, and speaking to her in a way no one should speak to anyone, let alone someone you were married to for almost 30 years. \n \n Our wedding isn\u2019t going to be for at least another year, and I definitely don\u2019t want him there at this point, but my fianc\u00e9 and I are visiting my family this summer so everyone can meet the babies. I don\u2019t want him anywhere near me or my kids, but I\u2019ve also seen firsthand what a great grandfather he is and I don\u2019t want my kids to resent me someday for keeping them away because of a situation that has nothing to do with them. However, I\u2019d personally be okay with never seeing him again. \n So, WIBTA?", "created_utc": 1672845936, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10369ya/wibta_for_not_inviting_my_dad_to_my_wedding_or/", "score": 40, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

He abused you as a child, he's abusing your mom through the process of separation. He would abuse his grandchildren.\n\nYou would only be TA if you let your kids interact with him.

Even without the affair stuff could you ever really trust him with your kids?", "NTA and it sounds like dad is a narcissist. From my experience, narcissists make horrible parents and grandparents. Protect your kids,they aren\u2019t going to miss out on anything with someone so awful.", "NTA, you never wanting to see someone who was abusive to you growing up is already enough reasoning. But if you feel so inclined, you can add on it is your job as a parent to keep your kids away from toxic traits and behaviors if it is in your power. A person is responsible for the consequences of their actions, regardless of their sexuality which isn't even a factor here, and losing these relationships along with yours is an easily justifiable consequence. Keep yourself and your kids safe from any sort of emotional trauma possible, number one priority.", "NTA. It is always ok to cut an abusive parent out of your life. Why would you risk him doing the same to your kids. I\u2019m no contact with my father and it was one of the best decisions I\u2019ve made. I\u2019m pissed your mother stayed with him so long if he was abusive.", "A great grandfather isn't just someone who dotes on the kids, but also someone the kids can look up to as a role model. Based on what you've described, I'm confident that going NC with him will not be a great loss to your kids' wellbeing.", "WNBTA\n\nIt\u2019s your job as a parent to pick & choose the people you want to be included in your kids\u2019 lives. If your father is not a good person (for whatever reason) in your opinion, he shouldn\u2019t be allowed to be around your children. Also, it\u2019s your wedding so invite the people you truly want to celebrate your day with.", "NTA. I grew up without my maternal grandparents in my life because grandma was so toxic.  You don't miss what you don't know. I have no regrets for the decision that my mother made to keep her parents out of my life. I didn't even notice it much back in the day, because I was busy doing what kids do - living my childhood. In fact, I think if I HAD been exposed to it at an impressionable age, it would have skewed my concept of what a 'grandparent' relationship is supposed to look like. So to the Right Thing: Protect your children!!", "NTA for not wanting him at your wedding and for not wanting him to have a relationship with your children in general. However, you said he\u2019s a great grandfather - I\u2019m wondering what exactly that means - and, like you said, there is a chance that your children might resent you at some point in the future. If they do, I don\u2019t think that would automatically make you an asshole. But depending on how important preventing that is to you, it might be worth it trying to find a workaround, like your fianc\u00e9 being there to essentially supervise all interactions between your father and your children. That way, your children would still get to be in contact with their grandfather but you wouldn\u2019t have to be in contact with him and he wouldn\u2019t be alone with them, as you mentioned in a comment that that\u2019s not something you want (which is absolutely legitimate.)", "NTA. He was abusive, that\u2019s the end. Even if he hadn\u2019t done anything else to anyone else, you are allowed to shield your future children and partner from an abusive parent. He sure sounds like he has an array of horrible behaviors on top of that too. You don\u2019t want this man to be a role model for your kids.", "NTA. He already chose his infidelity over your family. Its your wedding and you dont want that negativity around you.", "nta and your dad is a disgusting pig, please never introduce your kids to that pervert", "NTA. It seems like the cons of having him in your life outweigh the pros by a wide margin. The possibility of him being a decent grandfather doesn't seem likely based on the info.", "YWNBTA-for not inviting him to your wedding. Your wedding. Your wedding, your choice of guest list. However, withholding access to his grandchildren may be excessive. Unless there\u2019s a safety concern, he\u2019s still their grandfather and should be able to see them as practical for you and your schedule.

He was abusive to OP, he is now (and probably always was) abusive to OP's mom.  If he wants out so bad, he should be gone.  OP, you'd be doing everyone a favor by not having him around.

They all love him a lot, and this whole situation has been really hard on my oldest niece, she\u2019s really attached to him. He\u2019s a whole different person with his grandkids than he was with his kids. He also treats my two youngest siblings a lot differently than he treated me and my older siblings, they seem to have a pretty close relationship with him, and they\u2019re really broken up about all of this.

I\u2019ve gone through a lot of therapy to make sense of all the chaos in my childhood, and this has been a bit of a step backwards for me.", "Sadly, I\u2019ve developed trauma bonds that I\u2019m working on breaking through. He\u2019s been really apologetic and what I thought was remorseful. But in light of this new situation, I don\u2019t think he was remorseful at all and it was all apart of his \u201cI\u2019m turning over a new leaf\u201d act. Because the way he\u2019s acting right now is the man I\u2019ve always known and resented. I don\u2019t blame my mom for not leaving him, she has her own trauma bond with him. She knew about the men he\u2019d hooked up with before they moved, and she didn\u2019t tell a soul until now because she was protecting him. The only reason she\u2019s free of him now is because he left her.", "That\u2019s a horrible take. You\u2019re basically saying that anyone who stays in an abusive relationship can\u2019t have it that bad because they\u2019re still there, ignoring everything else that factors in beyond the abuse itself.", "That's not a way to gauge how bad abuse is at all. People don't leave severe abusive situations all the time. Just because her mom put up with it doesn't mean OP should or should have her kids around someone like that.", "I completely agree with you", "You are doing great! I didn\u2019t begin to unpack my childhood until I was 30. EDMR therapy was life changing! Enjoy your babies and mom. \u2764\ufe0f", "I have a somewhat similar situation within my family, and it resulted in supervised visits only per our family therapist. If there is a safety concern (physical, emotion, etc) then yes, absolutely you should make every effort to protect your children and ultimately yourself as well. Just make sure your motives are out of safety concerns and not spite for a person or situation. It may be worth speaking with a counselor who can third party weigh the pros and cons of having their grandfather in their lives.", "That\u2019s why I clarified the \u201cunless there\u2019s a safety concern.\u201d The OP didn\u2019t go into the discussion of prior abuse. But from the information we have, the mother stayed in the relationship and the OP was not removed by CPS, opting to leave at 18. OP later goes on to describe that she knows how great of a grandfather he can be. She\u2019s seen it firsthand. She needs to speak with a counselor and find out from a third party what is in the best interest of both her and her children.", "That\u2019s why I clarified with \u201cunless there\u2019s a safety concern\u201d. OP describes this man as a great grandfather. I understand that there is all levels of abuse and trauma and all levels of abuse and trauma recovery, up to and including writing someone out of your life completely. OP should sit down with an independent third party and suss out the issue with a professional so that if there is a chance her kids can have a safe and functioning relationship with their grandfather that they are able to do so.", "Yeah I still have to disagree. CPS doesn\u2019t always remove children from abusive situations, and you pretty much ignored where I stated people are trapped in abusive relationships all the time. It is OP\u2019s decision entirely.", "You're reasoning about the mother not leaving makes no sense. And you argue  \"unless there's a safety concern\" then say since the mom doesn't leave it can't be that bad. Your argument makes no sense.", "What you are saying is fair for sure. My family had a similar issue, and the compromise was supervised visits. But we reached out for professional help with the issue/decision because we recognized that it\u2019s not easy to separate our feelings and emotions from a situation. Sometimes our past experiences cloud  our current decisions to the detriment of others. A third party to help sort through emotional issues isn\u2019t a bad thing.", "I didn\u2019t reason that, that\u2019s what was stated in the  OP\u2019s post. There was scant and vague information about abuse and a whole lot of detail about her father\u2019s relationships with other men and infidelity within his marriage. In general you put emphasis with detail on things you feel are most relevant when conveying a story or event. She even ended the post with she believes he\u2019s a great grandfather and she has witnessed this firsthand. Abuse seems secondary to me to her hurt over the relationships with other men and infidelity issues. That\u2019s why a third party is needed, to hear the complete story and advise if there are any safety concerns and what to do about them.", "So let me ask you a question. I had a person who did horrible and downright unforgivable things to me. Say they got help and fixed the toxic behaviors. Am I supposed to let them around me and the people I care about regardless of the trauma they caused?", "In your scenario I would not also describe the person you\u2019re referencing as a \u201cgreat ______\u201d as the OP did in her post. It\u2019s a personal decision about how we deal one on one with the people who hurt us throughput our lives. In this case the OP is concerned with how she is dealing with the situation and how depriving the children of a \u201cgreat\u201d grandfather will affect them. That\u2019s a healthy consideration, and sitting down with a third party will help her work through any safety concerns should they exist and either validate her concerns or alleviate them."]}
