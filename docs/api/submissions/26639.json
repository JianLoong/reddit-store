That stuff is intended for paying customers, and if you are not one that\u2019s actually petty theft. I\u2019d do it if I had to, especially for my kids, but that\u2019s a terrible recommendation for poor people at large.\n\nEdit: I do find it pretty funny you think every fast food restaurant has vinegar packets.

Of lice crawling through his hair and around on his scalp. I think the people near him must have seen it too because everyone just slowly and quietly moved away from him. During the break he never came back.

That was supposed to take care of it but I think some of their friends had it and reinfected them. I didn\u2019t want to spend the money again so I\u2019ve been combing at home.  The first comb out took 6 hours, and then every other day for 2 weeks I\u2019ve been combing for over two hours every evening, painstakingly sectioning the hair. \n\nIt took a week before I didn\u2019t find a single louse in there, but then had to keep going another week just to make sure they were actually all gone. \n\nWhat a pain!!!!", "Those are her pets!

Yes. \n\nMy nieces had it for WEEKS. We went on a trip together so once we found out, I treated myself and my 2 children several times (my husband, who had not been on the trip, was forced by me to let me comb his hair). Never saw a live bug in my children's or my hair, no one was itching. Then suddenly my daughter has nits in her hair. We immediately went to one of those lice clinics that uses a heat treatment to kill the live bugs and dehydrate the nits. Best fucking money I have ever spent in my life. \n\nOver the next weeks I still found dehydrated nits in her hair. Apparently the glue of the nits breaks down so slowly?! Shit, I found one stray nit way down the hair shaft that was easy to pull out so I knew it wasn't fresh (though I did and still do regular head checks on my kids now) just last week. Her treatment was in January.\n\nI have more sympathy for lice sufferers than before because I noticed how even with the care I took to check our hair she still ended up with lice.

Believe you me, we tried to keep our distance from kids - particularly during known outbreaks of headlice.

Hats, fabric chairs, hoods, blankets etc.\n\nI will also say that when my kids were younger, they would get lice a couple times a year in their mid back-butt length hair. We didn\u2019t have a lot of money but I got rid of every outbreak with conditioner and a metal lice comb.", "Thank you for sharing that the lice-specific shampoos no longer work due to the lice evolving resistance! I dealt with this in my household. All three of us with long hair had gotten zapped (someone picked it up and school, and by the time we realized, all three of us had used the same hairbrush). All the brushes and combs in the household got boiled. Bedding was washed, dried and bagged in the sun. Stuffed toys were bagged, too.\n\nI was psyched to be able to treat myself and the girls without any poisons, but it was a major PITA. Every other day, I filled our hair with big masses of conditioner, put shower caps on, let us stew for at least 90 minutes (tropics, no A/C), and then combed out each head with a clean comb and then a louse comb, over and over, until there were no visible lice or nits in the residue wiped off the louse comb. It took crazy hours over the course of a week, but by the end we were all louse free for the cost of a louse comb and a big bottle of conditioner. If we'd had hundreds of bucks to pay a professional, I would have, but three heads of long hair wouldn't have been cheap.", "So if they try and they can\u2019t get the lice off, it\u2019s cool that they just continue to live their life glaring at everyone and being annoyed that people point out that they have lice? Are they allowed to hack in everyone\u2019s faces when they have Covid? This is all bad advice, if you have lice like this stay home And break out the fine tooth comb.", "All the reputable sources claim that lice don't spread easily, lice don't jump, lice need a piece of hair to climb on, etc.   Well, sorry, but from my own experience, I don't believe that for an instant.  I used to work in a doctor's office and I caught headlice from a patient.  I could see them clearly in her hair because she had jet black hair and it was quite an infestation.  I made sure I was always at least 4 feet away from her at all times and there was a counter between us.  I don't get up close and personal with patients anyway.

I had several breakdowns over it.  I dumped diatomaceous earth on my head, literally took a bucket of it and shoved my head in there every day for like 2 weeks.  It worked but my scalp was toast for awhile.", "Yeah we can talk about treatments and avoiding lice, but once you get it - it's a whole thing. \n\nMy parents got more and more aggressive with treatments every time I got lice, so I was basically sleeping on poision smelling pillows and having panics about washing and combing my hair, again and again.\n\nI have confidently stated that I will shave my head if I ever get lice again. In hindsight, my hair goes very slowly, so that would mean a ~ decade of short hair. So, I will just have to be hella vigilant and remove myself from any exposure.

The conditioner makes it easier to comb and immobilizes the lice so it is easier to get them all.  I repeat it every few days so that if I missed some nits and they hatch they get removed before they are old enough to reproduce.  \n\nIt takes a lot of time, especially the first combing.  The later combings aren't really going after the nits, just the live ones, so they don't take as long.  If your child has long hair and has ever thought of getting it shorter, this is the time.  Even a little trim to get rid of rough ends makes it so much easier to comb.", "The reality is that you can use whatever product. The key is to be incredibly thorough with the combing part of the process. \n\nWhen my kids had it, we did all the stuff, and killing the adult lice and getting rid of them really isn't that hard. It's getting rid of the eggs that is basically torture. \n\nThe eggs tend to be near the scalp and they stick to the hair strands really well. Even with the nicer combs, I still ended up using my fingernails to scrape those little bastards off most of the time. So basically, after doing the treatments and combing out all the creepy crawlies, you have to go through the hair section by section and look for the eggs and pick those out.\n\nThe professional above saying that it's a socio-economic issue might have a point in that it's easier to pay someone to do that grueling process than do it yourself. Especially if you have little free time. But you don't have to buy expensive medicines or tools. The most effective treatment is to just be incredibly thorough.", "Not sure what this guy is talking about.  The OTC stuff works just fine.  The big thing is that a lot of them recommend retreatment after a week to be sure you got them all.

But how was she not scratching her like crazy?", "NTA and I have ptsd trauma so bad from years of my daughter  bringing home lice from school and all the associated cleaning and picking and combing and drinking wine to cope that I would have asked for a refund due to a  unaddressed health hazard present at the conference. Or burned the place down bc u only need one to jump on you.", "NTA.  I would have warned the other group.", "NTA however I can totally understand how embracing that must have been for that lady.", "NTA.  You did it in private and politely.", "NTA. Thank goodness she moved. You could have gotten them, too.", "NTA. That\u2019s horrid. What if she say in those soft conference chairs, then someone sat after her? Or she ride shared? NOPE!", "YTA. You said you were scheduled to attend the seminar. I'm going to assume this wasn't a voluntary thing you could sign up for if you wanted to go, but something you were told you had to go to.\n\nI've had lice multiple times during school outbreaks. You know you have lice way before other people see it. What you told them wasn't something they could fix [in 5 seconds](https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/therapist-5-second-rule-about-commenting-on-appearance-48739875). It's not even something they could fix in a day.\n\nWhat you should have done is find HR either in person or email them about how that employee should have been on sick leave to prevent the spread of a contagious health risk for the same amount of employees are sent home to prevent the spread of covid (hopefully a week).\n\nYou did nothing to help the situation and brought attention to something they could do nothing at that moment to fix. And chances are they couldn't have ditched the work seminar without jeopardizing their job. The only thing you accomplished is making someone feel worse about themselves. Your company should have not only given them a pass to not attend the event but should have explicitly told that employee they couldn't attend work or any work related functions for a week.", "NTA. If I didn\u2019t know I\u2019d be so thankful someone told me discreetly. And if I did know I might just burst into tears but certainly still be grateful that someone was kind enough to tell me rather than use me for gossip fodder. And really if you could see it that means she has to know and she willfully exposed everyone there. That\u2019s just not okay.", "> because lice aren't going to keep themselves to just her head\n\nDo you think they jump and fly?\n\nLice *crawl*. Very slowly, and they prefer to stay on the nice warm and humid environment of the human scalp. This is a classroom full of adults. They're probably not sticking their heads right next to each other to giggle about boys, or borrowing each other's headbands and hats.", "NTA, but is it possible they are her pets? Maybe she named them Sonic and Amy.", "On this subreddit, I've often seen people make judgements with a comment along the line of [the 5 second rule](https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/therapist-5-second-rule-about-commenting-on-appearance-48739875), don't comment on someone's appearance unless they can fix it in 5 seconds. Or the [5 minute rule](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-minutes-rule-rishika-choudhary), same thing but 5 minutes.\n\nHas that suddenly gone out the window? \n\nI've had lice multiple times back in elementary school outbreaks. You know you have lice way before it gets visible to other people.\n\nThat person knew they had lice. Telling them they have lice isn't going to change anything. It's not something that can be fixed spending 5 minutes in the bathroom in front of the mirror.\n\nWhat does OP expect to get out of telling the person something they already knew? The person introducing themselves to each new person with the caveat \"sorry I have lice\"? The person leaving the event? Them asking a custodian for a trash bag to wrap their hair in for the remainder of the event? Them never sitting down on any chairs and telling everyone around them they have lice when they ask them why they're standing creepily away from everyone?\n\nWhat is the end goal of telling someone something they definitely knew about and couldn't do anything to immediately fix the problem?\n\nEdit: I'm going to answer my own question. OP said they were scheduled for the seminar, implying employees didn't have a choice whether or not to attend. This likely includes the lice employee. They should have emailed their HR rep whenever they could about how it's unacceptable the lice employees boss didn't give them sick leave to take care of the obvious health risk.", "Really? I can\u2019t even imagine that. I have long, thick, curly hair. \n\nI can\u2019t even get a regular comb through my hair. It has to be an oversize, wide-tooth comb and my hair has to be wet and conditioned.\n\nIf I ever got lice I\u2019d need to shave my head.", "I say this as someone who has a child in middle school\n \nThere is no new way to get rid of them. You need the good nit comb and some good nit ladies or they just keep on coming.", "Another INFO, could she skip the scheduled work function without jeopardizing her job? \n\n\nAnd a third INFO, do you know if she tried getting out of attending the work function because of the lice but was told no by her own boss?", "He said they were crawling around, I'm pretty sure dandruff doesn't crawl", "Are you the person that OP is talking about? You're getting very worked up. You seem like the type of person that moaned about being unable to breathe during the pandemic because of a mask.", "I've seen it.", "You know I would rather shave my head than have lice.", "I have the same. And I agree, i don't like lice. But we had a kid in the hospital with it, and the whole family was infested and just... didn't care. I guess it's common enough in some parts of the world that they just get used to it? Thankfully I didn't get them, but we were wearing booties and scrub caps into that room for the duration of their stay", "I never actually got lice as far as I know.\n\nMy parents are just paranoid so anytime the school was like \"someone in your class got lice\" we had to do the whole song and dance and full course treatment.\n\nOr maybe it was me and my parents just lied to me", "You got special shampoo? I got kerosene. But yeah, it haunts me too. I wasn\u2019t allowed in my room for weeks until my dad made sure everything was clean.", "Yeah, but seeing how bad it's for her (op noticed it across the table), I don't think she tried even the basic ones.. anyway, knowing how contagious it is, people with lice shouldn't be so negligent", "You can always shave the head, and that'll work. Nits can't hatch if they're not kept in the same conditions as, well, being less than a quarter inch from the scalp.", "What really worked for us was covering the kid\u2019s hair with conditioner and then combing it out with a lice comb. Did that every evening for ten days straight. That way you catch the young lice before they\u2019re old enough to produce nits. I also manually took out all the nits and washed or vacuumed everything during those ten days. My washing mashing really got a workout. It\u2019s a bloody nightmare. We tried the chemical stuff first but they didn\u2019t really help kill the little buggers.", "As a single person who got lice from time to time, I feel qualified to answer:   \nYou get the comb, vinegar/shampoo and conditioner, soak, condition and comb, and, after that, you dye your hair. \n\nThe days after, you should only comb out dyed nits, as soon as you see a fresh one, you have to treat your head again.", "That's not a great solution for an 8 year old girl, unfortunately. The boys sometimes shaved their head. But then that outed them as one of the ones with lice. The drama!", "This genuinely made me chuckle \ud83d\ude2d", "Literally picking fleas and other parasites off each other is a huge part of social bonding for the other great apes. In captivity, they actually have ectoparasites added so they can do this.", "Our schools aren\u2019t excluding kids for live anymore. Even in the lower grades. \n\nOur kids use rosemary spray every morning and protective hair styles just in case.", "My sons school actually asks that you don't keep your kids home if they have lice. Apparently it's not an excuse to stay out anymore which is crazy to me.\n\nIf I know my kid has lice I'm going to do everything I can to try and get rid of it before sending him back. I'm not about to make other kids suffer.", "For me, it's vinegar.  My grandma would wash my hair in vinegar and the spend hours picking at me head with her fingernails.", "Yeah, my mom threatened us that if any of us got lice then she was going to shave our heads. Then told us all the ways to prevent it, not sharing hats or hair stuff, etc. Super disappointed she didn't follow through when my sister got them at 16, lol. Shr got them from her friend, who knowing she had lice, came and slept over. In the same bed!! She was no longer allowed in our home.", "I have never had lice but my hair is really short so I could just shave it off.", "Lol \ud83d\ude02", "While reading this thread has made me itch, it's worth it for the image of ticks jumping out of a tiny tick helicopter \ud83d\ude01", "Meds for animals aren't held to the same safety standards as meds for people. I don't think you dhould be recommending this.", "I can confidently say that once is more than enough", "That was me. All through grade school. They loved my hair. My poor mom is a saint!", "Mayonnaise for me! My mom made me sleep with my head covered in mayonnaise because it was supposed to be so thick it would suffocate them. Didn\u2019t work", "I taught high school for many years and the girls would often tell me that they would just dye their hair to get rid of the lice. They claimed it was better than any lice specific treatments they tried.", "There\u2019s an oil/enzyme combo now that with a very good combing, kills them so much better than the RIT lysol or whatever they used to use. It\u2019s supposed to do what the Mayo thing was supposed to but I can attest does actually work. Again complete combing is needed, like hours of combing if you have long or thick hair. But your hair is very silky soft after (in NO WAY worth it).", "last thing we need are lice with a 'choke me daddy' kink and a taste for tuna salad", "Bedbugs...", "Sounds neglectful to me. All you need is a fine tooth comb."]}
