That stuff is intended for paying customers, and if you are not one that\u2019s actually petty theft. I\u2019d do it if I had to, especially for my kids, but that\u2019s a terrible recommendation for poor people at large.\n\nEdit: I do find it pretty funny you think every fast food restaurant has vinegar packets.

Of lice crawling through his hair and around on his scalp. I think the people near him must have seen it too because everyone just slowly and quietly moved away from him. During the break he never came back. Every time I hear someone or read something about lice I immediately think of that day and wonder how on earth he wasn\u2019t scratching his skin off.", "INFO Did you think she somehow doesn\u2019t know she has lice?", "NTA. I would have been ruder to be honest and told her at once and then get far away from her and also warn everyone around. She must know that she has lice and still goes around and likely infecting others. That is totally irresponsible.", "So gross", "My head is itchy reading this", "Nope", "NTA, I'd appreciate being told. It's unfortunate it was lice but ot is what it is", "Great.  Now I'm itchy.", "I worked in a high school. We had a senior pupil who always had lice. Refused to get rid of them.   \n\n\nTurned out that it was a response to abuse. The stranger in the OP might be someone in a similar situation, but there's no way that anyone else should have to sit near her.   \n\n\nI once caught head lice from a pupil and there's no way I want to go through that again.  (Yes, they tell you that you're fine so long as your heads don't touch. Nevertheless, the little crawlers/jumpers seem to find a way to spread.)", "This. OP, you tried to do a nice thing, but, yeah, she knew, she just didn't care if she exposed everyone to it.", "Exactly. After how we treated people during covid, there should be no problem banning people with visible bugs.", "Are lice that bad?", "Omg My kids are FINALLY through their head lice after almost a whole summer. \n\nFirst I spent almost $800 at a lice clinic getting everyone checked and treated and buying all the shampoos and such. That was supposed to take care of it but I think some of their friends had it and reinfected them. I didn\u2019t want to spend the money again so I\u2019ve been combing at home.  The first comb out took 6 hours, and then every other day for 2 weeks I\u2019ve been combing for over two hours every evening, painstakingly sectioning the hair. \n\nIt took a week before I didn\u2019t find a single louse in there, but then had to keep going another week just to make sure they were actually all gone. \n\nWhat a pain!!!!", "Those are her pets!

I recall mayonnaise was an alternative to rid.", "How do you feel about all of those things in the hair of the person at the table with you?\n\nLike I don't mind snakes or spiders. But if the lady across from me had visible spiders playing in her hair I'd have a real issue with it.", "There is nothing irrational about hating lice. Nitpicking is the most horrific task you can have. I spent countless hours bent over my kids heads checking every follicle for nuts and lice. It's a nightmare.", "omg I have curly hair and my mom would take them out herself. it was horrible!!!! Brushing non stop onto a white sheet then picking out the nits that were left behind on my hair.  and she has the hardest, natural nails Ive ever seen.... TRAUMATIC \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d. I lost my shit when my daughter got them and cried! Then I got them out in 2 days. Luckily I always check their heads at least a couple times a week so it was juts the beginning of a possible infestation. I would've moved seats sooooooo fast!!!!", "She has an infestation. Your teacher is a coward and clearly didn't do shit other than a polite chat. Use your student services, you can't have other people (their families, friends, children etc...) at risk from that.

Poor girl has nits and anyone with working eyes and glasses will find out, if other people get them THEN she will be shunned tribal style and fast.", "I mean, this kind of makes you an AH then.", "Me and my little sister got lice when I was like 7.  The memory of all the special shampoo and combing i had to go through, then bagging up all of our bedding and stuffed animals to take to the laundromat to clean in bulk haunts me.", "Ugh. Yes. \n\nMy nieces had it for WEEKS. We went on a trip together so once we found out, I treated myself and my 2 children several times (my husband, who had not been on the trip, was forced by me to let me comb his hair). Never saw a live bug in my children's or my hair, no one was itching. Then suddenly my daughter has nits in her hair. We immediately went to one of those lice clinics that uses a heat treatment to kill the live bugs and dehydrate the nits. Best fucking money I have ever spent in my life. \n\nOver the next weeks I still found dehydrated nits in her hair. Apparently the glue of the nits breaks down so slowly?! Shit, I found one stray nit way down the hair shaft that was easy to pull out so I knew it wasn't fresh (though I did and still do regular head checks on my kids now) just last week. Her treatment was in January.\n\nI have more sympathy for lice sufferers than before because I noticed how even with the care I took to check our hair she still ended up with lice. I also recognize how privileged I was to be able to pretty much throw $180 at the problem and be done.", "[removed]", "I worked in a school. Believe you me, we tried to keep our distance from kids - particularly during known outbreaks of headlice. Staff still caught them.   \n\n\nIf you're sitting next to someone or they're standing next to you, the little crawlers can still get you: it only takes a momentary brush from a strand of long hair.", "I will add that they can pass by fabrics as well. Hats, fabric chairs, hoods, blankets etc.\n\nI will also say that when my kids were younger, they would get lice a couple times a year in their mid back-butt length hair. We didn\u2019t have a lot of money but I got rid of every outbreak with conditioner and a metal lice comb.", "Thank you for sharing that the lice-specific shampoos no longer work due to the lice evolving resistance! I dealt with this in my household. All three of us with long hair had gotten zapped (someone picked it up and school, and by the time we realized, all three of us had used the same hairbrush). All the brushes and combs in the household got boiled. Bedding was washed, dried and bagged in the sun. Stuffed toys were bagged, too.\n\nI was psyched to be able to treat myself and the girls without any poisons, but it was a major PITA. Every other day, I filled our hair with big masses of conditioner, put shower caps on, let us stew for at least 90 minutes (tropics, no A/C), and then combed out each head with a clean comb and then a louse comb, over and over, until there were no visible lice or nits in the residue wiped off the louse comb. It took crazy hours over the course of a week, but by the end we were all louse free for the cost of a louse comb and a big bottle of conditioner. If we'd had hundreds of bucks to pay a professional, I would have, but three heads of long hair wouldn't have been cheap.", "So if they try and they can\u2019t get the lice off, it\u2019s cool that they just continue to live their life glaring at everyone and being annoyed that people point out that they have lice? Are they allowed to hack in everyone\u2019s faces when they have Covid? This is all bad advice, if you have lice like this stay home And break out the fine tooth comb.", "All the reputable sources claim that lice don't spread easily, lice don't jump, lice need a piece of hair to climb on, etc.   Well, sorry, but from my own experience, I don't believe that for an instant.  I used to work in a doctor's office and I caught headlice from a patient.  I could see them clearly in her hair because she had jet black hair and it was quite an infestation.  I made sure I was always at least 4 feet away from her at all times and there was a counter between us.  I don't get up close and personal with patients anyway.  So how did I manage to catch the little blighters?", "What would a single person do with really long and thick hair? It hasn't happened (touch wood) and I could definitely remove the live critters with a comb and conditioner. But it'd be impossible for me to pick out all the eggs, particularly from the back of my head I can't see! I don't have anyone to help me, what would I do?", "My mom told she got lice once from another girl at school. She bought hair dye the same color as her hair. Dyed her hair and the chemicals in the dye killed the lice. This was in the 60's though. Not sure if hair dye was different then. I've never had lice so I never had to try.", "How do you get rid of them if just going bald doesn't work?", "Yes \"lice live on heads, not beds!\".  Washing everything in the house is time wasted that could be spent combing out nits. Cheap conditioner and a lice comb is all you need.", "In British schools when children were inspected for headlice (this is in the 50s & 60s) the title wasn't a professional lice technician but 'Nitty Norah'", "Lol professional lice technician...      I'm pretty sure you are just a mother who has dealt with lice over at least 2 kids!", "Thank you for the information. It is good to know!", "More personal experience but I've found that heat (straighteners etc) is pretty good at killing them", "So, for future reference, what DOES work in getting rid of them if pharmacy products don't work anymore?", "Can you share the best method for getting rid of lice?", "I had heard that they were resistant now! Does dimethicone spray still work? Seeing as that smothers them and coats their spiracles and they suffocate, they can't really be resistant to that can they?", "Emotional support lice.", "Being extremely uncomfortable with parasites seems like a very useful survival trait.", "This was my perspective...and then I got lice.  I had several breakdowns over it.  I dumped diatomaceous earth on my head, literally took a bucket of it and shoved my head in there every day for like 2 weeks.  It worked but my scalp was toast for awhile.", "Yeah we can talk about treatments and avoiding lice, but once you get it - it's a whole thing. \n\nMy parents got more and more aggressive with treatments every time I got lice, so I was basically sleeping on poision smelling pillows and having panics about washing and combing my hair, again and again.\n\nI have confidently stated that I will shave my head if I ever get lice again. In hindsight, my hair goes very slowly, so that would mean a ~ decade of short hair. So, I will just have to be hella vigilant and remove myself from any exposure. We don't have kids yet but lord help me I will not go thru having lice ever again.", "Right? I'm not HR, but I have been management and would side with OP 100%. \n\n\"I'm really sorry you're going through this difficult situation, but they were only trying to look out for your best interests discretely.

That's all she can do.", "I still shudder any time I have to see or smell Tea Tree Oil.", "Yeah I feel for any women that get lice because you basically have to go through all the headache/expensive treatment. For me when I got them as a kid it was as simple as just shaving my head bald. Couldn\u2019t imagine having to go bald now, as a kid you dont have to care about how long it will take to grow back (or if it even will) lol", "This is also a bot comment.  Weird that the bot replying to it got called out first.", "[deleted]", "[removed]", "I very distinctly remember the girl in my kindergarten class who came to school one day with a shaved head and cried for a week straight. Her brother got lice, and their mom decided the best solution was to shave both their heads in the middle of the night.", "coat hair in cetaphil, let dry, then rinse out and comb/pick out the eggs. the cetaphil suffocates the live ones but you need to make sure to get all the eggs or it\u2019ll happen all over again!", "I slather the hair in cheap conditioner and go at it with a good nit comb, not the cheap plastic kind that come in the kits.   The conditioner makes it easier to comb and immobilizes the lice so it is easier to get them all.  I repeat it every few days so that if I missed some nits and they hatch they get removed before they are old enough to reproduce.  \n\nIt takes a lot of time, especially the first combing.  The later combings aren't really going after the nits, just the live ones, so they don't take as long.  If your child has long hair and has ever thought of getting it shorter, this is the time.  Even a little trim to get rid of rough ends makes it so much easier to comb.", "The reality is that you can use whatever product. The key is to be incredibly thorough with the combing part of the process. \n\nWhen my kids had it, we did all the stuff, and killing the adult lice and getting rid of them really isn't that hard. It's getting rid of the eggs that is basically torture. \n\nThe eggs tend to be near the scalp and they stick to the hair strands really well. Even with the nicer combs, I still ended up using my fingernails to scrape those little bastards off most of the time. So basically, after doing the treatments and combing out all the creepy crawlies, you have to go through the hair section by section and look for the eggs and pick those out.\n\nThe professional above saying that it's a socio-economic issue might have a point in that it's easier to pay someone to do that grueling process than do it yourself. Especially if you have little free time. But you don't have to buy expensive medicines or tools. The most effective treatment is to just be incredibly thorough.", "Not sure what this guy is talking about.  The OTC stuff works just fine.  The big thing is that a lot of them recommend retreatment after a week to be sure you got them all.  I think another thing people might forget to do is treat bedding, hats, pillows, etc. To prevent reinfesting.\n\nSource: I'm an aunt who had to treat her niece for lice repeatedly.
