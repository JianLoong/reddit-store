But if it's that bad they know.", "NTA. You were trying to help, but maybe she felt embarrassed.", "I wouldn't have sat with her.

Love a good injury or infection.\n\nSample of shit - meh whatever\n\nBut lice, well they make me severely uncomfortable, irrationality so.

As a child, I was always out of school with it, rarely attending a field trip, etc. It's miserable to get rid of without shaving your head.\n\nI won't get lice again. I'd remove myself from any exposure.", "NTA especially as you waited to tell her in private. Which is very considerate of you.", "NTA- my kids got lice from school. Totally common  to happen but of course I got it. The treatment shampoo destroyed my artificial hair color and damaged my hair.

Professional lice technician I can tell you lice don't spread easily by sitting at a table with others. \n.\nLet's just dispell some myths since the internet is full of them. \nLice don't jump like fleas... actually fleas are what everyone should be afraid of since they can live in air vents and mattresses for weeks and pass from people to pets... lice are people only.\nLice spreads by head to head contact. So hugging, cuddles, huddling around an electronic device etc. \n\nTypical pharmacy lice products don't work anymore because lice are resistant to them.\nLice can't live off the head for more then 24-48h\nAnd they need a piece of hair to climb on in order to move with any efficiency with their 6 little legs. \nIf anyone has questions (I'm not selling anything and give free advice with my business too) just DM me\n\nBut op, your NTA for telling her. She probably knew and was super embarrassed... just remember that just because someone has visible lice doesn't mean they haven't been trying to get rid of it... I see families all the time who are at the end of their ropes because they've spent hundreds of $ in pharmacy lice products that aren't working... but have been trying. \nLice is a socioeconomic issue. If you can afford treatment you can treat it... if you can't... too bad.\n\nEdit for spelling and format", "Maybe they would have included mayonnaise in the seminar gift package lmao", "Lice is just made up by the government to scare you.

Lice are actually far bigger, and if an infestation is bad enough, yeah, they can be visible.", "I had lice throughout my childhood until I was 8. I grew up in a 3rd world country in a very small town & my neighbors happened to be very unhygienic, but there were lots of kids so I was always there. My lice weren't visible, as my mom was actively trying to get rid of them. But their lice were visible because they just left them. I could see them crawling around & even on their foreheads at times. I pointed it out when that happened & they got defensive & uncomfortable every time, though. So I could see why this person had that reaction. \n\nIn other words, it's not always visible unless there's so many of them, that they crawl out of the head from the lack of space. OP was lucky this person moved away.", "Yes the small one aren\u2019t easily visible but the adult ones most certainly are, I can vouch that I\u2019ve seen in children\u2019s heads from approximately one meter away.

Not everyone can grow back to it\u2019s normal state from bald in under two years. Cut all my hair off in 2020 and it still isn\u2019t fully back to where it was. I\u2019m still missing about 2-3 inches.", "Yes?\n\nShoulder length hair, which some women consider \"short\" would be 2 years worth of growth for me.", "How? Not everyone gets itchy from lice. I get that lice is highly stigmatized and can be hard to get rid of and that having lice doesn\u2019t inherently mean you can\u2019t go to work, but OP presumably assumed she didn\u2019t know because they were so visible and not being covered.", "She told her privately in the restroom. She didn\u2019t call her out publicly for it.  And while there are worse things in life, it is a cause for concern.  Lice spreads easily and quickly, and as you\u2019ve said, takes time and resources to fully get rid of.  How many people there do you suppose had families?  That\u2019s their time and money they have to spend to get rid of something that this person did not.  That\u2019s their time off from work to have to deal with the problem personally from coming into contact with this woman.  And if they got it, their kids likely would get it, too. That\u2019s more time off from work to deal with that because the kids can\u2019t go to school with that and continue to spread it around.  Schools send kids home for that.  So\u2026yeah, it\u2019s a problem that becomes everyone else\u2019s.", "Just head down to the free food store, right?", "There are better ways to deal with lice too, shaving should always be a last resort", "And if you cared that much about your hair, you would let it get INFESTED with lice", "What does being itchy have to do with informing management and not going up to someone a stranger mind you and blurting it out in the bathroom? It\u2018s another employee at a workshop for all the op knows it could be a higher up at another branch of the company", "What you are not getting to is the lady was offended and moved away. It was a workplace workshop. You can make excuses but this person put themselves at risk for potential trouble at work. They no longer do checks for this at schools because it is just a nuisance. Regardless I will not change my opinion. I would not have done it. I would have spoken to someone in hr or management for a second opinion then let them deal with it.", "Where do you live that you couldn\u2019t walk into a fast food restaurant and take a bunch of vinegar packets, that they leave on tables, if you really couldn\u2019t afford \u20ac2 for a bottle of Mayo/olive oil/vinegar. Or a post online in a family group for some donations, or a local Church or homeless shelter. There\u2019s many routes you SHOULD go down before decided to traumatise your child by shaving their head. It\u2019s just laziness.", "Have you ever been to a grade school? All the hats and coats are together. If one kid gets lice, the entire class ends up with it.", "If I had something potentially embarrassing like that and didn\u2019t know about it, I would definitely rather find out about it directly and discretely like this than know someone talked about it behind my back and told multiple people (including my boss) about it. You might disagree with it from an HR standpoint, but that doesn\u2019t instantly make it an AH thing to do.", "You can have your opinion.  OP was not wrong, though.  This was not at the office. This was at a seminar, and the woman was a stranger sitting nearby.  If this were someone at the office, then I could see your point.  She could have gone to her supervisor and the supervisor could have dealt with it.  OP dealt with it as gently as she could have - by talking to her privately.", "Sometimes poor people have to work, and don\u2019t have time to explore every opportunity, so they only have time for one option like shaving their kid\u2019s hair. \n\nAlso, being scrappy and scrounging up some packets doesn\u2019t make that stuff suddenly free food. That stuff is intended for paying customers, and if you are not one that\u2019s actually petty theft. I\u2019d do it if I had to, especially for my kids, but that\u2019s a terrible recommendation for poor people at large.", "And if it new trainee that is going into upper management that you don\u2019t about your screwed", "You can say that but only time will tell", "That still doesn\u2019t make OP an asshole, unless you count the potential negative outcome as OP being an AH to herself.", "There is nothing OP did that HR or a manager would not have done.  Only a manager or HR would have told her to take a personal day or two to deal with the problem."]}
