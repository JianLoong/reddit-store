I'm okay with this being knowledge to everyone because it will eventually come up organically with anyone in our lives. Drinking has always been a part of our relationships. This weekend I spent time away with a friend and my wife spent time with her friends. On both days she told separate people (more than one conversation) that I had spent days in the hospital. She did this without talking to me about it or even thinking about if that's something I'd like to have disclosed.. she says that she had a right to talk about it with them but I disagree. That detail is very embarrassing to me not that anyone should be embarrassed for seeking help in that sittuation, but nonetheless, I am for that detail (being so severe and without control, feeling weak). These are all people who are mutual friends and I've spent years knowing and hanging out with, so I consider them my friends also. I'm just very disappointed and upset with her and we're clearly in a fight now. The fact that I put her through my alcoholism has made any of my complaints seem small because of the magnitude of it all. So, I feel defenseless. She definitely seems to feel empowered. She's already accused me of drinking on one occasion because I had a long day at work and wasn't the happiest. I haven't and do not plan to drink, I'm looking very positively on my future with out drinking. I want to be done and free of it as much as anyone would want it for me.Thanks for letting me rant.

Your wife is likely suffering immense pain. Why should she keep it a secret? You want all the support and none of the responsibility. Do you real think EVERYONE in your circle is in the dark about your addiction? Damn. \n\nYTA x 10", "YTA. I don\u2019t think alcoholics realized the torture they put family and friends through. She\u2019s allowed to have a support system in place that you couldn\u2019t be. She doesn\u2019t need to struggle in silence to protect your ego. \n\nPart of your healing is acknowledging the damage you\u2019ve done, not hiding from it. Feel your shame, process it and then you can move forward.\n \nCongrats on your 41 days!", "YTA. She is allowed to seek support from her friends. You're not the only one experiencing this. Your drinking has obviously impacted her life as well.", "YTA. Quit looking for reasons to alienate a person who is trying to support you on the journey to sobriety.  41 days isn't near long enough to prove anything, or erase what your alcoholism has meant in her life.", "My husband is a recovering alcoholic who did a 28 day program in June. He specifically asked me to tell our friends while he was in rehab so that when he got out everyone knew and would keep him accountable. He's over 90 days sober now and doing really well and I think a large piece of that is friends coming up with other things to do than drinking. He goes to restaurants frequently but now feels very bored in most bars.   \n\n\nAll this is to say, I guess my judgment is dependent on what her motivation was in telling her friends\u2014I would imagine that she is proud of you for being sober or wanted to let them know to keep you accountable, not to embarrass you. That said, it would have been courteous for her to talk with you about what you are comfortable sharing.   \n\n\nPS: great job on 41 days of sobriety!", "YTA.\n\nAs a child of an alcoholic she has every right to vent to whoever she wants to. Your alcoholism has effected her in ways you will NEVER understand and if she wants to talk about it, you just have to deal with it.", "YTA\n\nYou have a problem, and you need help from her.  You think the only mental aspect of your alcoholism only affects your mental health? Your wrong and she needs to talk it out with others to keep her sanity too. If this helps her to cope, so that she can help you cope, this is your price of admission to her aiding you.", "YTA - do you think others haven't noticed your problem?   Have a look at your control issues, she has a right to talk with her friends for support for the pain you have caused her.", "> I\u2019m just very disappointed and upset with her\n\nDon\u2019t you think she might feel the same way about her alcoholic husband?\n\nThis is hard on both of you, she needs support from friends in order for her to support you. She can\u2019t fill from an empty cup.\n\nCongrats on your sobriety and I wish you the best - but YTA here man.", "YTA\n\nIt came up organically\n\n> Hey wife of OP how were the past few weeks?\n\n\n> oh great he's finally realised he has a drinking problem\n\n\n> oh good, whew!\n\n\nThere", "YTA. You should be grateful she stayed with you it was not easy for her. She probably needs support and understanding from her friends. You need to accept responsibility for the harm you caused rather than pick fights with your wife. You were the one who put yourself in the hospital with your behavior. I wish you luck with your sobriety.", "Respectfully YTA   First. Congratulations on your sobriety.  But I think you're way too thin skinned.  Your wife has been through a lot and deserves to have friends to lean on.  Get over the idea that everyone is judging you.", "YTA\n\nI absolutely understand why you would find her sharing this embarrassing. However, that fact is eclipsed by the fact that she absolutely needs a support network who she can make aware of this situation.  She needs to be able to talk about her feelings with family and friends and letting them know what you are going through is part of that. You being hospitalized didn't just happen to you. Please, please be man enough to set aside your pride and allow her to get any support she can. I understand how difficult that might feel.", "YTA. Your alcoholism isn't just a you problem. ALcoholics are enabled by co-dependency, and one of the hallmarks of a co-dependent relationship is having to make excuses for an addict. Good for you for trying to beat the addiction, but spare some empathy for someone who stuck with you through your hospitalization. She went through trauma that you don't seem to acknowledge. Trust me any of your close friends knew you had a problem, and your wife needs to stop covering for you. Good luck and keep going one day at a time.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard and often feels shameful to be in the situation you\u2019re in. I\u2019m sure you want it to just go away. But the reality is that your behavior in your addiction has affected her. She has her own processing to do in order to deal with it. She needs a support system and asking her not to talk to her friends in order to manage your own shame about your behavior isn\u2019t fair. \n\nYou have to learn to deal with that shame. You have your own judgments of yourself. Go to therapy to help release you of those, and let her go through the process she needs to heal. You probably would both benefit from couples counseling, too.", "Sometimes we feel anger when we feel vulnerable. I\u2019m sure your mutual friends knowing about your struggle makes you feel vulnerable and that\u2019s normal! Don\u2019t let vulnerability make you angry, try re framing that emotion in your mind. It can bring you closer to other people, it is a normal feeling and normal feelings mean you are experiencing humanity!", "YTA My spouse was sober for 8 months after a month in the hospital going through detox. He almost died. The doctor was shocked he didn\u2019t. I lost my damn mind for that month worrying about him. Congrats on your 41 days and I hope you are lucky enough to stay sober because a lot of people don\u2019t the first time. I needed someone to talk to about it. So does your wife.", "I think you are overthinking here. My hubby had to go to hospital for the same reason. And yes I talked about that with my friends. Because I was very very worried aside of being exhausted from dealing with his drunk ass person.\n\nMost likely she just needes support and did not intend to embarass you.\n\nHowever yeah you do have the right for privacy. \n\nPlease talk with her, tell her why you are upset so she understands your side. Maybe you guys can find someone who can support her but you are comfortable knowing. NAH I think.\n\nAnd my hubby sees people knowing what is up with him as an advantage. See those friends in the know look out for him as well.\n\nAlso for her accusing you of drinking, you being stressed will trigger her fear if that was your drinking pattern. Still happens for me despite the hubby being 2 years sober now.", "Good on you !  keep up the good work.  It's not easy and the relationship needs attention to survive.  let her know you are nervous about her talking openly, but it's the best way.  put it out there so when you are at an occasion, you dont have everybody asking about your drink.  also, be ready for someone to say, I need that too.  and you give it away to keep it.   So go public and stay awesome !", "YTA. You should have told her not to tell. Of course she needs support. Loving an alcoholic is so painful and exhausting and really awful to go through alone.", "YTA \n\nRecovering alcoholic here. Sober for 5 years. Your drinking has caused issues you'll never understand for her. She's allowed to reach out to friends for support. You don't get to decide if she's allowed to discuss what's bothering her. She's allowed to reach out for support. \n\nYour drinking isn't a great, well kept secret. They likely already know. You trying to control who she finds support in makes you even more asshole ish.", "YTA. Without a shred of doubt.\n\nThe reason your complaints seem small in comparison to what she's gone through is because *they are* small.\n\nYou're whining about feeling a bit embarrassed and vulnerable. Boo-fucking-hoo.\n\nI am the adult child of an alcoholic. Unless you've lived in a home with someone so utterly unpredictable and draining for any length of time, you cannot understand what it's like.\n\nI saw my mother destroyed over the course of my life and it took her nearly forty years to leave.\n\nYou are lucky enough that your wife is still sticking by you *at all*. You cannot expect her not to get support from her friends and loved ones. Regardless of if they're mutual friends or not.\n\nLiving with an alcoholic is like living with Dr Jekyll. You never fucking know when Mr Hyde will come out and go on a tear.\n\nSo yeah, suck it up buttercup. You want to stay sober? Take accountability.  Acknowledge and accept that you *will* be embarrassed about this. For a good long while. But your wife will need all the support she can get if she's meant to stay with you.\n\nBecause most of us? We would have cut bait and let you flounder on your own.\n\nBe grateful she's still there.", "You're disappointed and upset with her???  Dude.  I grew up in a house of alcoholics and my ex husband was a rager.  The amount of times I had to suffer for their addiction was INNUMBERABLE.  You have NO IDEA how much loved ones of alcoholics suffer or what we go through.  You have no idea OUR disappointment in being treated like doormats, having to constantly hear empty promises, having everyone support the alcoholic while simultaneously expecting the non-alcoholic to have endless patience, and endlessly having their needs ignored for the \"sick\" person.  You think this makes her feel empowered?  Wtf, man.  There is NOTHING empowering about having to live with or around an alcoholic.  She has NO obligation to help you, assist you, forgive you, etc.  Your actions AFFECT HER and she has every right to vent about issues that are affecting her.  I'm sure the LAST thing on her list of things she wants to do is tell her friends and loved ones that she's emotionally struggling because of her husband's issues.  What about the issues she has because of you?  YTA.", "I'm 8.5 months sober I've lost 74 lbs and feel great . be proud don't worry about who knows.. Keep up the good work you got this", "Soft YTA. She\u2019s allowed to talk to her friends about what you\u2019re both going through. This isn\u2019t only about you and your experience and your pride. Your addiction affects your wife and family as much as it affects you. \n\nPart of recovery is accepting the label of being an addict. Yes, you are a recovering addict, whose addiction put them in the hospital. Make peace with that and don\u2019t be ashamed. Be proud. Wear recovery as a badge of honor. The cat is going to be out of the bag if you plan to stick to not drinking, I assume that means in front of all your friends. So they\u2019re all going to know eventually. Don\u2019t worry about it. The real ones will stick around, and the ones that aren\u2019t, well, it\u2019s better for the trash to take itself out at the beginning of your recovery anyway instead of months down the line when it could shake your foundation. \n\nYou got this bro. I\u2019m proud of you!", "She\u2019s does have a right to talk about what SHE is going through: dealing with your selfish alcoholic ass. \n\nYou put her through so much you should be happy she\u2019s even staying with you after the trauma you\u2019ve caused. And now you want her to bottle everything up and pretend like life is fine?\n\nNo, you need to actually ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY for what you\u2019ve done, which includes letting her feel her feelings. \n\nYou should be embarrassed. Not for seeking help, but for being a selfish asshole who put your wife through all this in the first place. \n\nYou don\u2019t get to set conditions with how she copes. YTA", "YTA.  Since when is it not ok to get support from friends about a situation that YOUR HUSBAND is dragging you through???", "YTA - your thinking is typical of an addict here. It\u2019s selfish and uncaring behavior.", "YTA. Did the crime, pay the price. We\u2019re you not thinking this was a possibility when you were drinking so heavily you ended up in the hospital? Seems like a known consequence alcoholics tend to overlook due to selfishness.", "You're definitely the asshole. My dad was the same after he got admitted into rehab/hospital for his alcoholism. The alcohol fried your brain and makes you think you're smarter/better than you really are. Your entire circle knows you're a drunk so stop trying to gaslight yourself.", "YTA. She needs a support system just as much as you do and everything associated with your alcoholism is another layer of trauma for her.\n\nUnfortunately, for you 41 days is a huge thing, for her it's a drop in the bucket. Your alcoholism has essentially given her a form of PTSD. She really needs her own therapy to address the impact of living all these years with an active alcoholic.", "YTA. You are not the only one recovering from your alcoholism. SHe is too and she has less avenues for healing than you. So, she leans on friends (that's what they are there for). Be accountable for your issues, don't find ppl to blame.", "YTA Friends provide support and comfort, and you have no right to deny her that. Alcoholism takes a LOT out of the spouse, and she needs to be able to talk about it in order to work through it and heal.", "YTA your wife is going to need some support to help her deal with everything. Of course she is going to talk about it with her close friends. I get that it is embarrassing to you, but those are your own emotions to deal with due to your own actions.", "YTA. Like you said, your alcoholism has put your family and loved ones through a lot. She should be able to vent.", "You're RAW right now.  Everything is going to bug you.  Your wife needs to attend Al-Anon so she can get a better understanding of where you are.  You need AA, work the steps and get a sponsor.  It does get better, I promise.  The first days are the worst.  ESH.", "YTA.\nPeople want to keep their medical issues private but those are mostly about sex/beauty surgery etc.\n\nShe needs to decompress and feel light about it by talking it out.\nShe has also faced the burnt of your actions. She is a victim of your actions.\nYou could speak about your unhappiness but fight about it was wrong", "YTA. It\u2019s natural for her to share big events in her life with her friends (which includes your alcoholism and hospitalization) and it\u2019s natural for her to want a support system and someone to vent to about all of the trauma and turmoil that you\u2019ve surely put her through in the last however many years through your addiction. You seeking help for your addiction and committing to being sober is definitively the least embarrassing thing that has happened to you during your addiction and I can almost guarantee that every single person she told about your hospitalization now sees you in a better light than they did previously. You\u2019re in the early stages of recovery and obviously you\u2019re going through a lot but you really have no right to get mad at your wife for sharing that information with her friends and she does not deserve to be treated like that.", "Well, YTA if you didn't specify that she shouldn't talk about it. You say you're okay with people knowing about your alcoholism. Just reading that made me think you would be okay w/people knowing about a hospital stay. But if that wasn't clear to your wife, you can't blame her for talking about it.\n\nIt was not good of her to accuse you of drinking though. I hope you guys have good support around you, people you can talk to, as you go thru this process.", "INFO: is your specific issue her bringing up the hospital stay?", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say not the asshole. I don't like when people tell others about stuff that's supposed to be private between me and them. My family is like that telling their friends about my personal struggles with mental illness which is super uncomfortable. \n\nA lot of people here are filling in the blanks of what his past behaviour was but we don't know any of that. He probably has done some assholeish things while being on alcohol, and some say well she deserves to do what she wants as some kind of karmic justice for what she's been put through. I don't think OP is automatically an asshole for being an alcoholic either. Addiction can happen to anyone. \n\nLet me put it this way. If I was hospitalized with depression or something and my partner told everyone about my experience without asking me I would feel a bit shitty about it. But if I didn't specifically tell her I don't want other people to know then I also couldn't really blame her. All in all it's not that big of a deal, I'm sure none of your friends think worse of you for getting help just maybe tell her to be more discreet in the future, and then if she agrees and still does it then she would be the asshole. Best of luck on your recovery, I hope you and her can patch things up.", "ESH. This seems like communication issues cut and dry. You should tell her how you feel about this, she should be more respectful when talking about something that\u2019s this fresh of a wound.", "NTA - Firstly I want to say keep up the great work 41 days is huge!\nSecondly I Want to say I understand exactly where your coming from. When I decided to get sober 3 years ago I felt the same exact way, it's really no one's business but yours. I mean you were already embarrassed or ashamed by admitting you were an alcoholic probably to complete strangers. Now everyone knows! (side note everyone probably knew you were a drunk too) \nBut also dude, acceptance is the answer to all your problems. Don't be a dry drunk. Let it be and move on don't harbor the resentments this was what you were trying to bury anyways by drinking it away, work the steps and keep your side of the street clean. Attend meetings, find a sponsor, your going to be alright! \nIt doesn't matter what anyone thinks of you right now. What matters is your sobriety. Not worth  the argument with the wife. Especially if she doesn't truly know what it's like to be in recovery. One day at a time. Shit, somedays it's a minute at a time.", "Hey. Congrats on your recovery - it\u2019s hard work that you should be proud of. \n\nI think what\u2019s hard (I\u2019m a mental health and substance abuse therapist) is that alcohol use disorder affects everyone in a family. While it\u2019s happening to you, it\u2019s also happening to the people that you love. \n\nThat means that your wife likely needs support and should absolutely be able to talk with others if she needs to. Still, I think that you are also entitled to some privacy and that there\u2019s an opportunity here to negotiate some boundaries between you. \n\nIt\u2019s very possible for your wife to share and connect with others around her emotions and experience without needing to share your private medical details. That\u2019s what you need to ask for instead of asking her not to share at all.  (Example: \u201cI\u2019m having such a hard time with my spouse being unavailable due to treatment\u201d communicates the same as \u201cI\u2019m upset because my spouse has been inpatient at X hospital.\u201d) \n\nIf she refuses to stop sharing details of your treatment that you feel are personal after a sit-down discussion, preferably involving your treatment team, I would explore whether there\u2019s resentment between you that\u2019s making it difficult for you to connect with and attend to each other. \n\nNAH because you\u2019re both hurting and trying your best right now. Wishing you all the best.", "Have you and your wife spoken about how you were both going to approach this with friends/family? \nIt must have come up in the past 41 days, and while you can\u2019t dictate how she deals with being the wife of an alcoholic-you should have at least had discussions about it. Couples counselling? I would think after being hospitalized that some type of therapy would be in place.\n\nAlso-if you were so bad as to need hospitalization, this has been going on for years. I hate to say it, but all those friends already knew. When she was struggling-they were there for her. She would have vented, cried and needed their support because you weren\u2019t there.\nShe didn\u2019t let out a secret.", "YTA. Focus on your recovery. Congrats on 41 days.", "It's not like your friends are unaware that you're an alcoholic. You may think you hid it from them, but they knew. YTA", "YTA \nit\u2019s good your doing something and it is one day at a time, but you don\u2019t get to dictate how your wife deals with it. She spoke about it with close friends and has stayed with you she didn\u2019t put up a Facebook post. \nComing from a place of someone who is sober since March 18th my problem was binge drinking rather than day to day but only because I knew I probably couldn\u2019t get away with it.", "YTA and should probably be happy you still have a wife", "YTA\n\nMy mums ex was an alcaholic that i was made to live through as a teenager.\n\nIts horrible. In ways you will never know.\n\nWell done for being sober for this long. I hope it continues for you. But you need to let her be able to talk about her experience too. If anything its probably a good thing because the more who know, the more who can support your sobriety.\n\nI wouldnt say telling folks the darkest secrets or darkest moment is a great idea. No one need know EVERY detail. But she needs to be able to talk through what she has tone through and to get support from her friends.\n\nI suggest you both look into marriage counselling or therapy. The best thing would be for you both to have individual therapy as well as couples but money can be tight for some.\n\nThat way you can discuss these issues in a setting that is mediated, controlled and you can gather practical solutions or at least constuctive feedback from your therapist.\n\nYour wife has been through a lot. The fact she thought you had drank because you were unhappy shows you what moods you showed and gave her when drinking. So cut her some slack. Get out your own head and find a way to fix your marriage.

You are the person with the problem, yes. It\u2019s very hard on you, yes also. It\u2019s hard for you to talk about it, I can understand that. It\u2019s hard for you to know that people know about your alcoholism. \n\nBut you have to understand what your wife is going through. Being the relative of a person with alcoholism is extremely tough. You feel so lonely because you can\u2019t relay on your relative to feel better. It\u2019s not like you\u2019d understand what your wife is going through, just as your wife, as a non-alcoholic person, can\u2019t fully understand what you are going through. \nAs the child of an alcoholic I just had to talk about it with some friends. I just had to share that burden with somebody, even if it meant that my friends saw my parent differently after I told them. \nYour wife needs her support system. Your mutual friends are her support system and yours, too.", "YTA\n\nThere are programs for the loved ones of alcoholics. She is allowed to vent about an issue that has a major impact on her life. \n\nWhat lie would you prefer she tell?", "If you feel embarrased, it is by your own making, not hers.\n\nYou say it is mutual friends? All the better.\n\nThey know you are drinking and have known for the longest time. \nAnd now they know you are on the mend and can support you.\n\nSo if you want to be angry, ferl free. As long you are angry at yourself and not your wife", "YTA. She needs to be able to talk to her friends about this.", "Two wrongs don't make a right. ESH. She should respect your privacy. I'm sure she's done a few things you know about and you chose to keep to your self. \n\nOn the other hand her being able to vent to your friends is probably one of the reason she managed to stick with you as long as she has.", "YTA, and sound like the typical alcoholic.  Causing plenty of problems at home due to your drinking, but want to play the victim bcuz people talk about you? Grow up.", "YTA You already ruined your own PR by being the booze hound. Congrats on getting sober but you did the damage. She\u2019s just venting about it. You don\u2019t get to control the narrative. This is part of it. You will\nHear more about your old self. Stay sober for years and it will die down.", "YTA.  \n\nYou have a long way to go bud, 41 days is nothing.  Nobody trusts you yet.  She's venting with every right to.  You have to keep working on your sobriety and eventually she will be proud of your changes.  Right now though, you have piss to lay in and there's really nothing you can do about it. Fighting about it isn't a solution.", "Yta. For many of the reasons stated by others. Question: what was your wife supposed to say when her friends asked her why you went to the hospital for a couple of days? Her friends were probably concerned for you and her, should she have lied according to you?\n\nIf they are your friends too, didn't you tell them you were in the hospital? And isn't part of accepting the addiction seeking support from others? For you and your wife?", "YTA. \n\nI think every step is an an important one, so I do want to acknowledge your 41 days and your decision to continue avoiding it. \n\nHere's the problem:\n\n>I'm okay with this being knowledge to everyone because it will eventually come up organically with anyone in our lives.\n\nYou can't have it both ways.", "Nta. It's fine to talk about the alcoholism and how it has affected her, but there is no need to talk about your hospital stay. And I say this as someone with several recovering alcoholics in the family. That is an intimate medical thing that should not be discussed without your consent.", "I think that bith of yous cold have done better here.\nShe could have asked who you were comfortable knowing about it.\nBut also, you have to realise that she needs someone to vent to, loving someone with addiction can be traumatising.\nIt might have been a better idea for her to talk about it anonymously online, at a support group, or to have just asked who you were comfortable with knowing.", "She has no right to speak to anyone about anything that involves YOU in a way that would make you embarrassed. That seems like a very obvious thing when seen from my perspective, and I can't help but wonder why your wife would shame you like this.\n\nYou have every right to feel betrayed. You need to speak this out with her, this is serious. I don't know enough to decide whether you are the asshole or not, but you're definitely a part of why this happened in the first place. Good luck.", "NAH or ESH. I can't tell fully. You're both acting shitty to each other, but for justifiable reasons.\n\nYou need couples counseling as soon as possible though. From your write-up here, this relationship is on its last wheels. Most of the blame falls on you here because of your past fuck ups, but it'll take work on both ends to make this work. \n\nIt's clear here your wife doesn't trust you (accusing you of drinking when you were in bad mood) probably for good reason. You shouldn't feel the need to be on the defense from your SO though, because she shouldn't be attacking you.

I'm okay with this being knowledge to everyone because it will eventually come up organically with anyone in our lives. Drinking has always been a part of our relationships. This weekend I spent time away with a friend and my wife spent time with her friends. On both days she told separate people (more than one conversation) that I had spent days in the hospital. She did this without talking to me about it or even thinking about if that's something I'd like to have disclosed.. she says that she had a right to talk about it with them but I disagree. That detail is very embarrassing to me not that anyone should be embarrassed for seeking help in that sittuation, but nonetheless, I am for that detail (being so severe and without control, feeling weak). These are all people who are mutual friends and I've spent years knowing and hanging out with, so I consider them my friends also. I'm just very disappointed and upset with her and we're clearly in a fight now. The fact that I put her through my alcoholism has made any of my complaints seem small because of the magnitude of it all. So, I feel defenseless. She definitely seems to feel empowered. She's already accused me of drinking on one occasion because I had a long day at work and wasn't the happiest. I haven't and do not plan to drink, I'm looking very positively on my future with out drinking. I want to be done and free of it as much as anyone would want it for me.Thanks for letting me rant. Typing it put has helped.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

But she was impacted, if this was inpatient, you were gone for a period of time. You weren\u2019t working and she had to keep the house afloat alone, while dealing with the rest of everyday life and trying to pretend to be normal. \n\nI guess for me it would depend on why she told. Was it venting because she was overwhelmed? Was she explaining your absence or just telling to tell? \n\nIt might be time for you both to look into counseling. I grew up with an alcoholic and I can\u2019t imagine trying to be married to one. Good luck on your sobriety.", "Yta! \n\nYou are disappointed with her\u2026 I imagine she\u2019s more than disappointed with you after being married to an alcoholic. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge thing and she\u2019s allowed to talk to her support network about the huge things in her life. \n\nFocus on more important things, try being 100% open with your whereabouts too, she is not wrong in being wary of where you are.", "YTA. you don\u2019t realize how this has affected her, and how much support SHE needs during this time. i\u2019m a child of two alcoholics, both in recovery. you need to realize what this has done to her and how she deserves to vent and deal with this with her friends help", "YTA!\n\nAnd you're looking for reasons to feel embarrassed and resentful. Look to your therapist or your sponsor or a friend or someone who has some experience with sobriety and ask for their guidance and help.\n\nComing to this forum to try to bolster your own anger is just feeding it. This place is an anger factory. If you want to actually deal with your hurt, you have to deal with all your vulnerability and shame about your disease.\n\nIt's not embarrassing that you were hospitalized, by the way. It's the natural effect of your drinking. \n\nYour wife deserves to live a shame-free life. Even when you are ashamed. You should not try to stop her from seeking support as she deals with the impact of your drinking on her life.", "Yta. The partners and families of alcoholics suffer a lot including from the embarrassment and secrecy of the situation. She deserves support from friends. It\u2019s her life too that\u2019s effected by your actions, how can you tell her she\u2019s not allowed to talk about it?

Keep it going.\nYour real supporters will be proud of you and believe in you. And they may be few. It can be a lonely journey but worth it in so many ways.\nIt's a hell of a fight that takes a ton of courage in so many ways.

Their spouses noticed. My family noticed. And, of course, I noticed. \n\nThis isn't likely to be the first time her friends have heard about your drinking.

Being sober is stressful (and boring) when you are used to numbing everything with alcohol.  Could you be starting a fight in order to have an excuse to drink and blame it on the fight?  Are you depressed?  Are you bored because alcohol was your entertainment?  No one on Reddit can really help you.  Speak to your doctor and sponsor if you have one.  Maybe you are right about being angry, but you\u2019re in a fragile place and you need real life face to face support to help you stay sober.  This is from an alcoholic who has been sober for 25 years.  It took a lot of counseling for me to let go of my anger at NOT being able to drink.  It takes time.\n\nEdit:  the hardest thing about getting sober?  It\u2019s caring about yourself.  You don\u2019t become an alcoholic because you like who you are.  If you learn to care about YOU and believe that your actions are causing harm to yourself, it\u2019s easier to monitor your behavior so that you feel mentally and physically healthier.  Your family and friends will benefit when you stop worrying about what they are doing and worry about yourself.", "I was/am an alcoholic depending on how you fell about. Last drink was Dec 13 2016. All you had to say was that you're an alcoholic for me to know YTA. Comes with brand. Losing the ego needs to happen for extended sobriety and happiness.", "YTA.", "NTA, I completely agree with you. It is one thing to say that you are a recovering alcoholic, as you say that will become public knowledge in organic conversation, it is quite another to go into detail about your hospital stay for it.\n\nTo me, that's a major breach of your trust and privacy.\n\nI see I'm apparently in the minority here on this topic, so I guess that's fine, I think anyone saying YTA is nuts though. I get it, he's an alcoholic, it has affected her greatly, no questions, no issues there. She did not need to start blabbing about his hospital stay whatsoever.\n\nWhen my wife did something similar to me, it was when I was there in person to hear it, and in the moment I just smiled and laughed like I thought it was funny. The second we got in the car and we were in private, I exploded. What the fuck is wrong with you? Handing out private details to someone about MY medical issues? Are you fucking serious right now? I was seriously, seriously pissed, almost ended our relationship. I have no problem with people knowing that I had a problem. I had a major problem with people hearing the details of how I was doing (or not doing) well. That is none of their business, unless I choose to divulge it myself.\n\nWhat she did is disgusting. There are ways to talk about this and get support for it from your friends and family without offering up intimate and personal details about it.\n\nEdit: do you all just read half the post or what? None of you bother to understand that OP has a problem with her divulging his hospital stay, not talking about him being an alcoholic. This is very reasonable, your medical care is your own and you are entitled to privacy about it. There are ways his wife could talk about this without that information.", "Haven't quite gotten to Step 8, have you?  Making amends to those your addiction harmed.  \n\nAs the wife of a recovering alcoholic (over 25 years), let me tell you something, 41 days, while admirable, is way too short of a time to proclaim yourself cured, or barely into recovery.

Some people are able to bottle the beast every day for the rest of their lives, but many--most, in fact--have slip ups.\n\nDo yourself a favor, your friends and family and re-read the steps.

AA should help you understand fully the gravity of what you put on others and how to heal with it instead of shoving it down. You\u2019d like to erase the past and ban her from talking about it, but you need to embrace it to move through it. It was a part of you. It\u2019s something you need to watch forever and keep it check. She is not in the wrong for needing support and to be honest man it\u2019s been like a month and some change. Not nearly long enough for her to be over a partners addiction and all it entailed. Again, these don\u2019t seem like the words of someone currently invested in the steps so I would really recommend it or the AA subreddit it could be a good place for support on this. They will acknowledge your girlfriend is in the right but give you some knowledge to work through it as well. Good luck and massive congrats on your 41 days ! It is great your making a change for yourself. Make sure acceptance of your past actions is a part of this change and the process will be a lot easier for you :)", "Another soft YTA. I'm the child of an alcoholic and I absolutely talk to my friends as a support network.

She should be allowed to share what\u2019s happening in her life with her support network, which unfortunately means your life events are going to be known.", "YTA guess what your feelings don't matter in this. She can tell anyone she wants. You didn't seem to care about your wife's feelings when you you were getting drunk.\nYou didn't seem to care about how she felt when dealing with your alcoholism.\nNow you give a shit because you are embarrassed by your own actions due to you being a alcoholic.

That was a cheap chit by your wife claiming bc you had a long day you must have been drinking.

The mental load of trying to protect them from their own choices is a further part of the harm alcoholism causes and also helps perpetuate the drinking- if the alcoholic never has to face any negative consequences from people knowing, they can\u2019t appreciate the full damage they are doing to themselves and everyone around them.

Something I know directly affects how she treated me after that and now even. I lied to friends and bosses and lost 2 jobs back to back over my drinking because I'd rather been at the bar. I would beg people for rides at 7pm and call them back at 3am blackout crying begging for another ride. I stole from gas stations and got arrested 2 times due to it.

That's obvious. Once you open the door to marital issues, you can't close that door. The impression will always be there. \n\nHOWEVER. My therapists (both personal + couples counseling) provided this warning with the caveat that there is a difference between venting about your spouse to be vindictive, manipulative, or influential over your spouse's secondary relationships, and *building yourself a much-needed support network.* \n\nI personally find this post to be lacking in a ton of pertinent information but if that's what OP's wife needs, all power to her. Being married to an alcoholic is incredibly challenging and isolating if you've decided to \"keep it in the house\" and seeking support from friends should always be an option on the table.", "THAT'S INCREDIBLE!!!
