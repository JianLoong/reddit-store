I'm okay with this being knowledge to everyone because it will eventually come up organically with anyone in our lives. Drinking has always been a part of our relationships. This weekend I spent time away with a friend and my wife spent time with her friends. On both days she told separate people (more than one conversation) that I had spent days in the hospital. She did this without talking to me about it or even thinking about if that's something I'd like to have disclosed.. she says that she had a right to talk about it with them but I disagree. That detail is very embarrassing to me not that anyone should be embarrassed for seeking help in that sittuation, but nonetheless, I am for that detail (being so severe and without control, feeling weak). These are all people who are mutual friends and I've spent years knowing and hanging out with, so I consider them my friends also. I'm just very disappointed and upset with her and we're clearly in a fight now. The fact that I put her through my alcoholism has made any of my complaints seem small because of the magnitude of it all. So, I feel defenseless. She definitely seems to feel empowered. She's already accused me of drinking on one occasion because I had a long day at work and wasn't the happiest. I haven't and do not plan to drink, I'm looking very positively on my future with out drinking. I want to be done and free of it as much as anyone would want it for me.Thanks for letting me rant.

Your wife is likely suffering immense pain. Why should she keep it a secret? You want all the support and none of the responsibility. Do you real think EVERYONE in your circle is in the dark about your addiction? Damn. \n\nYTA x 10", "YTA. I don\u2019t think alcoholics realized the torture they put family and friends through. She\u2019s allowed to have a support system in place that you couldn\u2019t be. She doesn\u2019t need to struggle in silence to protect your ego. \n\nPart of your healing is acknowledging the damage you\u2019ve done, not hiding from it. Feel your shame, process it and then you can move forward.\n \nCongrats on your 41 days!", "YTA. She is allowed to seek support from her friends. You're not the only one experiencing this. Your drinking has obviously impacted her life as well.", "YTA. Quit looking for reasons to alienate a person who is trying to support you on the journey to sobriety.  41 days isn't near long enough to prove anything, or erase what your alcoholism has meant in her life.", "My husband is a recovering alcoholic who did a 28 day program in June. He specifically asked me to tell our friends while he was in rehab so that when he got out everyone knew and would keep him accountable. He's over 90 days sober now and doing really well and I think a large piece of that is friends coming up with other things to do than drinking. He goes to restaurants frequently but now feels very bored in most bars.   \n\n\nAll this is to say, I guess my judgment is dependent on what her motivation was in telling her friends\u2014I would imagine that she is proud of you for being sober or wanted to let them know to keep you accountable, not to embarrass you. That said, it would have been courteous for her to talk with you about what you are comfortable sharing.   \n\n\nPS: great job on 41 days of sobriety!", "YTA.\n\nAs a child of an alcoholic, she has every right to vent to whoever she wants to. Your alcoholism has effected her in ways you will NEVER understand and if she wants to talk about it, you just have to deal with it.", "YTA\n\nYou have a problem, and you need help from her.  You think the only mental aspect of your alcoholism only affects your mental health? Your wrong and she needs to talk it out with others to keep her sanity too. If this helps her to cope, so that she can help you cope, this is your price of admission to her aiding you.", "YTA - do you think others haven't noticed your problem?   Have a look at your control issues, she has a right to talk with her friends for support for the pain you have caused her.", "> I\u2019m just very disappointed and upset with her\n\nDon\u2019t you think she might feel the same way about her alcoholic husband?\n\nThis is hard on both of you, she needs support from friends in order for her to support you. She can\u2019t fill from an empty cup.\n\nCongrats on your sobriety and I wish you the best - but YTA here man.", "YTA\n\nIt came up organically\n\n> Hey wife of OP how were the past few weeks?\n\n\n> oh great he's finally realised he has a drinking problem\n\n\n> oh good, whew!\n\n\nThere", "YTA. You should be grateful she stayed with you it was not easy for her. She probably needs support and understanding from her friends. You need to accept responsibility for the harm you caused rather than pick fights with your wife. You were the one who put yourself in the hospital with your behavior. I wish you luck with your sobriety.", "Respectfully YTA   First. Congratulations on your sobriety.  But I think you're way too thin skinned.  Your wife has been through a lot and deserves to have friends to lean on.  Get over the idea that everyone is judging you.", "YTA\n\nI absolutely understand why you would find her sharing this embarrassing. However, that fact is eclipsed by the fact that she absolutely needs a support network who she can make aware of this situation.  She needs to be able to talk about her feelings with family and friends and letting them know what you are going through is part of that. You being hospitalized didn't just happen to you. Please, please be man enough to set aside your pride and allow her to get any support she can. I understand how difficult that might feel.", "YTA. Your alcoholism isn't just a you problem. ALcoholics are enabled by co-dependency, and one of the hallmarks of a co-dependent relationship is having to make excuses for an addict. Good for you for trying to beat the addiction, but spare some empathy for someone who stuck with you through your hospitalization. She went through trauma that you don't seem to acknowledge. Trust me any of your close friends knew you had a problem, and your wife needs to stop covering for you. Good luck and keep going one day at a time.", "Soft YTA. \n\nI know it\u2019s hard and often feels shameful to be in the situation you\u2019re in. I\u2019m sure you want it to just go away. But the reality is that your behavior in your addiction has affected her. She has her own processing to do in order to deal with it. She needs a support system and asking her not to talk to her friends in order to manage your own shame about your behavior isn\u2019t fair. \n\nYou have to learn to deal with that shame. You have your own judgments of yourself. Go to therapy to help release you of those, and let her go through the process she needs to heal. You probably would both benefit from couples counseling, too.", "Sometimes we feel anger when we feel vulnerable. I\u2019m sure your mutual friends knowing about your struggle makes you feel vulnerable and that\u2019s normal! Don\u2019t let vulnerability make you angry, try re framing that emotion in your mind. It can bring you closer to other people, it is a normal feeling and normal feelings mean you are experiencing humanity!", "YTA My spouse was sober for 8 months after a month in the hospital going through detox. He almost died. The doctor was shocked he didn\u2019t. I lost my damn mind for that month worrying about him. Congrats on your 41 days and I hope you are lucky enough to stay sober because a lot of people don\u2019t the first time. I needed someone to talk to about it. So does your wife.", "I think you are overthinking here. My hubby had to go to hospital for the same reason. And yes I talked about that with my friends. Because I was very very worried aside of being exhausted from dealing with his drunk ass person.\n\nMost likely she just needes support and did not intend to embarass you.\n\nHowever yeah you do have the right for privacy. \n\nPlease talk with her, tell her why you are upset so she understands your side. Maybe you guys can find someone who can support her but you are comfortable knowing. NAH I think.\n\nAnd my hubby sees people knowing what is up with him as an advantage. See those friends in the know look out for him as well.\n\nAlso for her accusing you of drinking, you being stressed will trigger her fear if that was your drinking pattern. Still happens for me despite the hubby being 2 years sober now.", "Good on you !  keep up the good work.  It's not easy and the relationship needs attention to survive.  let her know you are nervous about her talking openly, but it's the best way.  put it out there so when you are at an occasion, you dont have everybody asking about your drink.  also, be ready for someone to say, I need that too.  and you give it away to keep it.   So go public and stay awesome !", "YTA. You should have told her not to tell. Of course she needs support. Loving an alcoholic is so painful and exhausting and really awful to go through alone.", "YTA \n\nRecovering alcoholic here. Sober for 5 years. Your drinking has caused issues you'll never understand for her. She's allowed to reach out to friends for support. You don't get to decide if she's allowed to discuss what's bothering her. She's allowed to reach out for support. \n\nYour drinking isn't a great, well kept secret. They likely already know. You trying to control who she finds support in makes you even more asshole ish.", "YTA. Without a shred of doubt.\n\nThe reason your complaints seem small in comparison to what she's gone through is because *they are* small.\n\nYou're whining about feeling a bit embarrassed and vulnerable. Boo-fucking-hoo.\n\nI am the adult child of an alcoholic. Unless you've lived in a home with someone so utterly unpredictable and draining for any length of time, you cannot understand what it's like.\n\nI saw my mother destroyed over the course of my life and it took her nearly forty years to leave.\n\nYou are lucky enough that your wife is still sticking by you *at all*. You cannot expect her not to get support from her friends and loved ones. Regardless of if they're mutual friends or not.\n\nLiving with an alcoholic is like living with Dr Jekyll. You never fucking know when Mr Hyde will come out and go on a tear.\n\nSo yeah, suck it up buttercup. You want to stay sober? Take accountability.  Acknowledge and accept that you *will* be embarrassed about this. For a good long while. But your wife will need all the support she can get if she's meant to stay with you.\n\nBecause most of us? We would have cut bait and let you flounder on your own.\n\nBe grateful she's still there.", "You're disappointed and upset with her???  Dude.  I grew up in a house of alcoholics and my ex husband was a rager.  The amount of times I had to suffer for their addiction was INNUMBERABLE.  You have NO IDEA how much loved ones of alcoholics suffer or what we go through.  You have no idea OUR disappointment in being treated like doormats, having to constantly hear empty promises, having everyone support the alcoholic while simultaneously expecting the non-alcoholic to have endless patience, and endlessly having their needs ignored for the \"sick\" person.  You think this makes her feel empowered?  Wtf, man.  There is NOTHING empowering about having to live with or around an alcoholic.  She has NO obligation to help you, assist you, forgive you, etc.  Your actions AFFECT HER and she has every right to vent about issues that are affecting her.  I'm sure the LAST thing on her list of things she wants to do is tell her friends and loved ones that she's emotionally struggling because of her husband's issues.  What about the issues she has because of you?  YTA.", "I'm 8.5 months sober I've lost 74 lbs and feel great . be proud don't worry about who knows.. Keep up the good work you got this", "Soft YTA. She\u2019s allowed to talk to her friends about what you\u2019re both going through. This isn\u2019t only about you and your experience and your pride. Your addiction affects your wife and family as much as it affects you. \n\nPart of recovery is accepting the label of being an addict. Yes, you are a recovering addict, whose addiction put them in the hospital. Make peace with that and don\u2019t be ashamed. Be proud. Wear recovery as a badge of honor. The cat is going to be out of the bag if you plan to stick to not drinking, I assume that means in front of all your friends. So they\u2019re all going to know eventually. Don\u2019t worry about it. The real ones will stick around, and the ones that aren\u2019t, well, it\u2019s better for the trash to take itself out at the beginning of your recovery anyway instead of months down the line when it could shake your foundation. \n\nYou got this bro. I\u2019m proud of you!", "She\u2019s does have a right to talk about what SHE is going through: dealing with your selfish alcoholic ass. \n\nYou put her through so much you should be happy she\u2019s even staying with you after the trauma you\u2019ve caused. And now you want her to bottle everything up and pretend like life is fine?\n\nNo, you need to actually ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY for what you\u2019ve done, which includes letting her feel her feelings. \n\nYou should be embarrassed.

Since when is it not ok to get support from friends about a situation that YOUR HUSBAND is dragging you through???", "YTA - your thinking is typical of an addict here. It\u2019s selfish and uncaring behavior.", "YTA. Did the crime, pay the price. We\u2019re you not thinking this was a possibility when you were drinking so heavily you ended up in the hospital? Seems like a known consequence alcoholics tend to overlook due to selfishness.", "You're definitely the asshole. My dad was the same after he got admitted into rehab/hospital for his alcoholism. The alcohol fried your brain and makes you think you're smarter/better than you really are. Your entire circle knows you're a drunk so stop trying to gaslight yourself.", "YTA. She needs a support system just as much as you do and everything associated with your alcoholism is another layer of trauma for her.\n\nUnfortunately, for you 41 days is a huge thing, for her it's a drop in the bucket. Your alcoholism has essentially given her a form of PTSD. She really needs her own therapy to address the impact of living all these years with an active alcoholic.", "YTA. You are not the only one recovering from your alcoholism. SHe is too and she has less avenues for healing than you. So, she leans on friends (that's what they are there for). Be accountable for your issues, don't find ppl to blame.", "YTA Friends provide support and comfort, and you have no right to deny her that. Alcoholism takes a LOT out of the spouse, and she needs to be able to talk about it in order to work through it and heal.", "YTA your wife is going to need some support to help her deal with everything. Of course she is going to talk about it with her close friends. I get that it is embarrassing to you, but those are your own emotions to deal with due to your own actions.", "YTA. Like you said, your alcoholism has put your family and loved ones through a lot. She should be able to vent.", "You're RAW right now.  Everything is going to bug you.  Your wife needs to attend Al-Anon so she can get a better understanding of where you are.  You need AA, work the steps and get a sponsor.  It does get better, I promise.  The first days are the worst.  ESH.", "YTA.\nPeople want to keep their medical issues private but those are mostly about sex/beauty surgery etc.\n\nShe needs to decompress and feel light about it by talking it out.\nShe has also faced the burnt of your actions. She is a victim of your actions.\nYou could speak about your unhappiness but fight about it was wrong", "YTA. It\u2019s natural for her to share big events in her life with her friends (which includes your alcoholism and hospitalization) and it\u2019s natural for her to want a support system and someone to vent to about all of the trauma and turmoil that you\u2019ve surely put her through in the last however many years through your addiction. You seeking help for your addiction and committing to being sober is definitively the least embarrassing thing that has happened to you during your addiction and I can almost guarantee that every single person she told about your hospitalization now sees you in a better light than they did previously. You\u2019re in the early stages of recovery and obviously you\u2019re going through a lot but you really have no right to get mad at your wife for sharing that information with her friends and she does not deserve to be treated like that.", "Well, YTA if you didn't specify that she shouldn't talk about it. You say you're okay with people knowing about your alcoholism. Just reading that made me think you would be okay w/people knowing about a hospital stay. But if that wasn't clear to your wife, you can't blame her for talking about it.\n\nIt was not good of her to accuse you of drinking though. I hope you guys have good support around you, people you can talk to, as you go thru this process.", "INFO: is your specific issue her bringing up the hospital stay?", "I'm gonna go against the grain and say not the asshole. I don't like when people tell others about stuff that's supposed to be private between me and them. My family is like that telling their friends about my personal struggles with mental illness which is super uncomfortable. \n\nA lot of people here are filling in the blanks of what his past behaviour was but we don't know any of that. He probably has done some assholeish things while being on alcohol, and some say well she deserves to do what she wants as some kind of karmic justice for what she's been put through. I don't think OP is automatically an asshole for being an alcoholic either. Addiction can happen to anyone. \n\nLet me put it this way. If I was hospitalized with depression or something and my partner told everyone about my experience without asking me I would feel a bit shitty about it. But if I didn't specifically tell her I don't want other people to know then I also couldn't really blame her. All in all it's not that big of a deal, I'm sure none of your friends think worse of you for getting help just maybe tell her to be more discreet in the future, and then if she agrees and still does it then she would be the asshole. Best of luck on your recovery, I hope you and her can patch things up.", "ESH. This seems like communication issues cut and dry.

When I decided to get sober 3 years ago I felt the same exact way, it's really no one's business but yours. I mean you were already embarrassed or ashamed by admitting you were an alcoholic probably to complete strangers. Now everyone knows! (side note everyone probably knew you were a drunk too) \nBut also dude, acceptance is the answer to all your problems. Don't be a dry drunk. Let it be and move on don't harbor the resentments this was what you were trying to bury anyways by drinking it away, work the steps and keep your side of the street clean. Attend meetings, find a sponsor, your going to be alright! \nIt doesn't matter what anyone thinks of you right now. What matters is your sobriety. Not worth  the argument with the wife.

Couples counselling? I would think after being hospitalized that some type of therapy would be in place.\n\nAlso-if you were so bad as to need hospitalization, this has been going on for years. I hate to say it, but all those friends already knew. When she was struggling-they were there for her.

If anything its probably a good thing because the more who know, the more who can support your sobriety.\n\nI wouldnt say telling folks the darkest secrets or darkest moment is a great idea. No one need know EVERY detail. But she needs to be able to talk through what she has tone through and to get support from her friends.\n\nI suggest you both look into marriage counselling or therapy. The best thing would be for you both to have individual therapy as well as couples but money can be tight for some.\n\nThat way you can discuss these issues in a setting that is mediated, controlled and you can gather practical solutions or at least constuctive feedback from your therapist.\n\nYour wife has been through a lot.

It\u2019s hard for you to know that people know about your alcoholism. \n\nBut you have to understand what your wife is going through. Being the relative of a person with alcoholism is extremely tough. You feel so lonely because you can\u2019t relay on your relative to feel better.

But its up to you who knows that you went into hospital for it. It would be like telling people she went in for plastic surgery. Her place to say to people not yours. I am also a child of two alcoholic parents. Yes this has affected her in a lot of ways. But accusing you of drinking when you haven\u2019t is not going to help you.

I'm okay with this being knowledge to everyone because it will eventually come up organically with anyone in our lives. Drinking has always been a part of our relationships. This weekend I spent time away with a friend and my wife spent time with her friends. On both days she told separate people (more than one conversation) that I had spent days in the hospital. She did this without talking to me about it or even thinking about if that's something I'd like to have disclosed.. she says that she had a right to talk about it with them but I disagree. That detail is very embarrassing to me not that anyone should be embarrassed for seeking help in that sittuation, but nonetheless, I am for that detail (being so severe and without control, feeling weak). These are all people who are mutual friends and I've spent years knowing and hanging out with, so I consider them my friends also. I'm just very disappointed and upset with her and we're clearly in a fight now. The fact that I put her through my alcoholism has made any of my complaints seem small because of the magnitude of it all. So, I feel defenseless. She definitely seems to feel empowered. She's already accused me of drinking on one occasion because I had a long day at work and wasn't the happiest. I haven't and do not plan to drink, I'm looking very positively on my future with out drinking. I want to be done and free of it as much as anyone would want it for me.Thanks for letting me rant.

But she was impacted, if this was inpatient, you were gone for a period of time. You weren\u2019t working and she had to keep the house afloat alone, while dealing with the rest of everyday life and trying to pretend to be normal. \n\nI guess for me it would depend on why she told. Was it venting because she was overwhelmed? Was she explaining your absence or just telling to tell? \n\nIt might be time for you both to look into counseling. I grew up with an alcoholic and I can\u2019t imagine trying to be married to one. Good luck on your sobriety.", "Yta! \n\nYou are disappointed with her\u2026 I imagine she\u2019s more than disappointed with you after being married to an alcoholic. \n\nIt\u2019s a huge thing and she\u2019s allowed to talk to her support network about the huge things in her life. \n\nFocus on more important things, try being 100% open with your whereabouts too, she is not wrong in being wary of where you are.", "YTA. you don\u2019t realize how this has affected her, and how much support SHE needs during this time. i\u2019m a child of two alcoholics, both in recovery. you need to realize what this has done to her and how she deserves to vent and deal with this with her friends help", "YTA!\n\nAnd you're looking for reasons to feel embarrassed and resentful.

This place is an anger factory. If you want to actually deal with your hurt, you have to deal with all your vulnerability and shame about your disease.\n\nIt's not embarrassing that you were hospitalized, by the way. It's the natural effect of your drinking. \n\nYour wife deserves to live a shame-free life. Even when you are ashamed. You should not try to stop her from seeking support as she deals with the impact of your drinking on her life.", "Yta. The partners and families of alcoholics suffer a lot including from the embarrassment and secrecy of the situation. She deserves support from friends. It\u2019s her life too that\u2019s effected by your actions, how can you tell her she\u2019s not allowed to talk about it?

It can be a lonely journey but worth it in so many ways.\nIt's a hell of a fight that takes a ton of courage in so many ways.

Their spouses noticed. My family noticed. And, of course, I noticed. \n\nThis isn't likely to be the first time her friends have heard about your drinking.

Being sober is stressful (and boring) when you are used to numbing everything with alcohol.  Could you be starting a fight in order to have an excuse to drink and blame it on the fight?  Are you depressed?  Are you bored because alcohol was your entertainment?  No one on Reddit can really help you.  Speak to your doctor and sponsor if you have one.  Maybe you are right about being angry, but you\u2019re in a fragile place and you need real life face to face support to help you stay sober.  This is from an alcoholic who has been sober for 25 years.  It took a lot of counseling for me to let go of my anger at NOT being able to drink.  It takes time.\n\nEdit:  the hardest thing about getting sober?  It\u2019s caring about yourself.  You don\u2019t become an alcoholic because you like who you are.  If you learn to care about YOU and believe that your actions are causing harm to yourself, it\u2019s easier to monitor your behavior so that you feel mentally and physically healthier.

It is one thing to say that you are a recovering alcoholic, as you say that will become public knowledge in organic conversation, it is quite another to go into detail about your hospital stay for it.\n\nTo me, that's a major breach of your trust and privacy.\n\nI see I'm apparently in the minority here on this topic, so I guess that's fine, I think anyone saying YTA is nuts though. I get it, he's an alcoholic, it has affected her greatly, no questions, no issues there. She did not need to start blabbing about his hospital stay whatsoever.\n\nWhen my wife did something similar to me, it was when I was there in person to hear it, and in the moment I just smiled and laughed like I thought it was funny. The second we got in the car and we were in private, I exploded. What the fuck is wrong with you? Handing out private details to someone about MY medical issues? Are you fucking serious right now? I was seriously, seriously pissed, almost ended our relationship. I have no problem with people knowing that I had a problem. I had a major problem with people hearing the details of how I was doing (or not doing) well. That is none of their business, unless I choose to divulge it myself.\n\nWhat she did is disgusting. There are ways to talk about this and get support for it from your friends and family without offering up intimate and personal details about it.\n\nEdit: do you all just read half the post or what? None of you bother to understand that OP has a problem with her divulging his hospital stay, not talking about him being an alcoholic. This is very reasonable, your medical care is your own and you are entitled to privacy about it.

Making amends to those your addiction harmed.  \n\nAs the wife of a recovering alcoholic (over 25 years), let me tell you something, 41 days, while admirable, is way too short of a time to proclaim yourself cured, or barely into recovery.

Some people are able to bottle the beast every day for the rest of their lives, but many--most, in fact--have slip ups.\n\nDo yourself a favor, your friends and family and re-read the steps.

AA should help you understand fully the gravity of what you put on others and how to heal with it instead of shoving it down. You\u2019d like to erase the past and ban her from talking about it, but you need to embrace it to move through it. It was a part of you. It\u2019s something you need to watch forever and keep it check. She is not in the wrong for needing support and to be honest man it\u2019s been like a month and some change. Not nearly long enough for her to be over a partners addiction and all it entailed. Again, these don\u2019t seem like the words of someone currently invested in the steps so I would really recommend it or the AA subreddit it could be a good place for support on this. They will acknowledge your girlfriend is in the right but give you some knowledge to work through it as well. Good luck and massive congrats on your 41 days ! It is great your making a change for yourself. Make sure acceptance of your past actions is a part of this change and the process will be a lot easier for you :)", "Another soft YTA.

If you have people in your life that you both know there could have been a discussion about why it was important for you to share this information with the specific people yourself.

If you were truly an alcoholic, then trust me, no one close to y\u2019all in either of your lives will be surprised that you went. \n\nAll of that being said, I would suggest you get her some information on a local (or virtual) \nAl-anon meeting. She will be able to surround herself with people who genuinely understand what SHE has gone through and you can rest easier knowing that the situation is being discussed with a group of people who (should) keep the information within the room. \n\nCongratulations on seeking help and going some place to help begin the process of working through this.

Otherwise, it seems that you have no problem behaving in that manner, but you do have a problem when someone speaks about it...  and that is ridiculous.", "Light YTA- I have had my own issues with alcohol. Not an every day drinker but a binge drinker. Heavy too. 12 pack of beer and all the whiskey I could handle. This had obviously led to arguments with my husband. He vented to his mom about it. I was upset at first but knew he needed to be able to vent and get out his feelings. It's hard when you have the problem because you feel embarrassed and weak and out of control. I get all of that. You have to understand that your wife has been through a lot with your drinking and she needs to be able to talk about things. I know it made you feel weak but to her, you're not. If she is being supportive through this, you have to let her release her feelings. I would recommend doing that in therapy. It's helped me so much. That is also not a weak thing to do. I've been sober for almost 2 years. The thing is that sobriety isn't easy. You really have to make that choice every day to not drink. The whole one day at a time thing does work. You may even slip up but you can't give up. This has affected her as well. If you're not in therapy or a group to help you stay sober, your only person in this with you is your wife. And she is not your sponsor. She can be supportive but this isn't her problem. I'm sure you've leaned on her a lot and she was just seeking some comfort in friends. Your feelings of embarrassment are valid but you have to understand where she is coming from. I'm sure she was not making fun of you or making light of this or calling you weak. We all need that space to vent. You should, if you have access to the resources,  join a group or get therapy to help you and not rely on your wife for all of the support. I also highly recommend the book \"How To Stop Drinking (without willpower)\" from Alan Carr. I heard about the book from a comedian on a podcast a couple of years ago and bought it. She talked about how she read it and hadn't had a drink since. It really helped me a lot as well. Also, congrats on 41 days sober. I hope you continue to do well. It's tough.  But you're certainly not alone in this.", "YTA. I have been in the exact same position as your wife (granted, my husband\u2019s hospital stay was 10 days, and it was almost 12 years ago).

However, PLEASE try to realize that it is ALSO your wife\u2019s journey and experience, and she should be free to share it at her own pace as well. \n\nI do think it\u2019s reasonable to talk with her about how the details are shared going forward, but in my experience, my husband\u2019s hospital stay was one of the most terrifying and traumatic times of my adult life. I did not know what the future held, how long he would have to stay, how he would cope once he came home, or even if it was possible for us to stay together in the long term after everything his alcoholism had put me through. I desperately needed support from close friends and family, and my need for that support did not disappear as soon as he came home from the hospital. The path to sobriety is filled with uncertainty, and in some ways those first few months after his hospital stay were even worse than the time he spent drinking. Our entire lives and relationship to that point revolved around the consumption of alcohol, and our marriage had to be rebuilt almost from scratch.\n\nThis may be a case of both of you struggling so deeply that neither can be the \u201canchor\u201d in the relationship at this moment, which is a realistic part of any marriage, but please try to understand that while you are hurt, embarrassed, and uncertain, your wife is going through those exact same emotions, and has (according to you) supported you through this very difficult situation so far.

And I certainly understand how shame and stigma can fester - both as a child of an alcoholic and someone who cannot (safely) drink at all as an adult (also an alcoholic).\n\nIf you've had to be hospitalized for your drinking, I imagine it was severe enough you needed medical intervention to stop (serious kudos because people can die from detoxing if they have severe enough use). But also, drinking at that level seriously brings out the shittiest versions of people. I understand you likely feel shame about people knowing. But, likely your behavior was not the best while you were actively drinking, and likely caused a lot of harm. Often partners of alcoholics divorce/leave (48.3% - compared to those with partners that do not have alcohol use disorder 30%), so you're fortunate in that. \n\n(Sauce: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4002864/)\n\nEdit: Also, congrats on the sobriety.

For this specific thing, YTA, because your wife has without a doubt been through hell with you and your addiction, and is still standing by you--she deserves support.

I dkn't wamt to pile on but I do want to add a couple things I'm not seeing in the comments.\n\nMy mom actually was really good at hiding her alcoholish from people outside the immediate family (mostly by withdrawing, she also was never a social drinker). A lot of the people who showed up to her memorial had no idea that she hadbeen sick, even though she spent half my life drinking herself to death. Even if you did keep it a secret, your wife has the right to tell people. You have and will continue to be incapable of providing support for her on this issue. She has every right to seek it out.\n\nCongratulations on 41 days. Your future hopefully has a lot more days of sobriety, and I'm guessing your past had a lot of broken promises about sobriety. She's going to question you at times. I'm sorry, but you're going to have to accept that if this is going to work.\n\nGet into individual therapy.

What I do care about is that she feels she has the right to make things harder on him, especially when he is trying to change for the better.\n\nSHAMING ADDICTS WHO ARE ATTEMPTING TO RECOVER IS WRONG!!!! No excuses.\n\nThey are still married, and marriage is a PARTNERSHIP.\nThey should have discussed this together and compromised. Once again, THEY ARE BOTH VICTIMS of his addiction, so both of them are equally important, and both of their wishes should have been taken into account. She should have gotten a therapist to discuss any issues she has, and OP should be encouraged to go and talk about HIS problem with HIS own mouth when HE is ready to confront his close friends and family with the news.", "Yep, I know, I misread the post. My bad. Sorry about taking up your time over me, not reading the post correctly.I apologise and have a good one.\n\nI agree with your point, though. She has no obligation to support him, especially after all the distress OP has put her under.", "Honestly, you both are a little bit. You need to learn to have discussions about the situation and clearly outline boundaries. She does need someone to talk about how scary it probably was to see you need hospitalization. That\u2019s a big deal. But perhaps instead of your peer group, your boundary could be that she talk about it with someone (like a therapist or even an Al Anon group ) that could give her more constructive advice without also judging you.\n\nShe may have been also trying to talk to people about your needs, and mentioned the hospitalization as a way to explain how serious it is. \n\nBut you all have been interacting as alcoholic husband and his wife, and now you need to learn how to interact (including disagreeing) as recovering husband and wife.", "It comes down to a question of whether or not she wants to try to salvage the family and the marriage. Alcoholism is a disease. He was working with a mental compulsion more powerful than human will. I it wreaks havoc on human relationships. If he gets to AA, he can start putting his life back together and making  amends for the damage he has caused. In that case, she is not making the road easier for any of them by tearing him down to their mutual friends.", "YTA. As an alcoholic in recovery for 20 years, I'll say that you don't get to decide how your wife finds the support she needs to deal with your addiction. Your alcoholism is her problem too and affects her in big ways, especially if it landed you in the hospital. \n\nIt is vital for her to confide in friends to debrief her trauma that you caused. It's not like she's put it on a billboard for complete strangers.\n\nYou're going through a very challenging time right now and you have to recognize that your perception of reality is probably not actually reality yet. Your wife has to work through her part of all this too. Make sure you recognize that and give her the space to do that. When you quit people talk about it without you there. Get used to it. It will continue and the sooner you humble yourself and embrace that the smoother this will go for you socially. \n\nAnd congrats! This ain't easy, but you're doing it! Keep it up and surround yourself with good positive support - like your wife is doing!", "Yta", "Respectfully I disagree. She can go to a support group or therapy but to rat him out to MUTAUL friends seems malicious to me. She can tell her girlfriends. I doesn't sit right with me.", "A parent is still a human being.

If you're really invested in helping someone recover, you won't do shit like this to them.  There's a difference between a spouse needing support and venting, and then telling \"everyone who will listen\" about something so deeply embarrassing, hurtful and shameful.", "100000%", "I'm guessing you're either a teenager or someone who hasn't really rounded their thoughts up yet. This just screams angry and purposeless to me.", "that\u2019s not even the problem. she can talk about it his alcoholism bc he doesn\u2019t care, he said as much. he doesn\u2019t want HER telling people HE was hospitalized for drinking. that\u2019s not her information to share and he absolutely has a right to be upset, meanwhile she had zero right to tell other people about op\u2019s hospitalization before he decided he was ready for those certain people to know. NTA, and just because someone had a traumatic childhood does not give them the right to disclose personal medical information of literally any other person on the planet, including her husband", "I am shocked that so many people are upvoting this. OPs wife shared OPs medical details. So not cool.", "Congratulations on five years! And well said.", "Good news, OP replied elsewhere and said he's doing OK and went to a virtual AA meeting after this.", "THIS! I\u2019m recovering, 2 years and a few months sober - it sucks, it\u2019s embarrassing and we feel absolutely shame - but your wife needs support too. Work together to get through this, you\u2019re on the same team after all. Best of luck to you! Feel free to DM me if you want further suggestions / ideas on staying sober.", "This isn't abuse.  It reads like OP didn't even ask her to keep it secret.  He expected her to read his mind, and he's angry that she didn't.", "Dude probably had pancreatitis. Which is like a huge red flag to \u201cgosh he drinks too much\u201d to \u201che\u2019s going to die of this\u201d. So yeah, she probably told her friends like \u201cwtf. This is bad. His pancreas is shutting down and he will be lucky to live another 10 years\u201d.", "He just didn\u2019t want the hospital stay publicized", "To be fair, we don't know if she was tearing him down.

If she shows up at places on her own when they've both been invited, does she have to lie about where he is? Or just say \"I'm not at liberty to divulge that information.\" Or should she avoid social contact until he's safely home again? \n\nShe's not venting about his struggles as an alcoholic, she's venting about her struggles as the partner of an alcoholic. Part of that is being on her own while he's in hospital. She shouldn't need to cut down her support system to keep his secrets.", "Fuck that. Being hospitalized isn't specific medical information. It's traumatic for the family and having to keep an alcoholic 's secrets is so damaging. Loved ones of addicts are not obligated to shove down their pain over and over.", "OP confirmed it was specifically the hospital stay. He is open with everyone they know that he is an alcoholic and in recovery.", "Absolutely infuriating, isn't it? Like, the dude is wrong and his wife should be able to get the support *she* needs from something that affected her. But fuck, you'd think he was complaining that she told people he was beating her.

I'm just describing medical issues here.", "Recovering alcoholic here, and a hard disagree. I've walked in these shoes. OP is TA. When your dumbass addiction lands you in the hospital and traumatizes your family they are allowed to talk about it, full stop. You might feel embarrassed, but it's because of your bad decisions and nothing else. When you choose recovery you have to humble yourself to a degree that very few people understand. You don't get to hide it anymore, much less force your family to hide their own trauma that you caused.", "You said it so well! Completely agree.", "It is her friends, he just knows them too.", "100%. ACOA here. You\u2019re only as sick as your secrets and asking his wife to keep this secret is adding to the sickness. She had to deal with her husband being in the hospital. She can talk to her friends about how hard that was.", "I just wanted to say as someone who grew up with an alcoholic parent that never got help or took accountability, and so I never got closure, this reply hit me really hard and I appreciate every bit of it. People often have more compassion for my parent and their struggle than they do for me and my experiences and pain from it. Thank you, genuinely. I hope your recovery continues to be a success and you and those you care about and hurt can heal. \n\nOp is absolutely TA. And it's good to see people holding him accountable. Not just for his gf, but for his own sake. I hope he sees your post and let's that perspective sink in.", "Exactly. If he doesn\u2019t want anyone to know, go be an alcoholic all by your lonesome self. \n\nHe\u2019s dragged her into this and is trying to control the narrative. I\u2019m sure she\u2019s protected him for years already and is sick of it and can no longer carry the burden alone. \n\nIf you don\u2019t want to be talked about or don\u2019t want friends to know you were hospitalized for your alcoholism - maybe take steps to make sure you don\u2019t get hospitalized for your alcoholism? Like, that\u2019s totally on you bud.", "Exactly. And how likely is it really that this close circle of friends weren't already aware of OP's drinking? Conversation very well could have been \"he's in this hospital now, so maybe this is the rock bottom so he'll get help and turn things around.\" \n\nWe don't really know what \"in the hospital\" even means. Could be treatment program. Could be he nearly died. In either scenario, the spouse needs support.", "Feel the same about people with depression?", "I recognize my mistake in invoking hipaa, apologies for not understanding it better.

I hear it\u2019s going around.\u201d", "OP confirmed elsewhere the specific issue was her talking about the hospital stay. OP is 41 days into sobriety and feeling insecure about his perceived weakness.\n\nHe was wrong trying to keep wife from talking about it. Her mental health matters, and she needs to be able to talk.

He didn't want medical details shared with mutual friends.", "The wife isn't talking down to him, though? She went out with friends and did not hide the fact that OP's 41 days of sobriety also included inpatient treatment . This was not a case of the wife berating or browbeating OP for his addiction, but seeking the comfort of people who support her in what has no doubt been an extremely difficult time.\n\nOP has accepted the inevitable conclusion that their friend group will notice the sudden change in his behavior (I .e. not drinking at a social occasion after having never turned down a drink when it's been offered), but is still in the \"hide and downplay the level of his addiction\" phase.  It sounds like he's hoping that even though he will have to admit to \"a bit of a drinking problem in the past\", he would prefer to maintain a narrative that downplays his negative behavior, or alternatively be able to claim that he was strong enough to white knuckle through quitting his addiction without assistance.  \n\nBoth of these narratives are incredibly self-serving in how they are meant to help OP maintain a falsely inflated self-image. But the fact that he sees nothing wrong with demanding his wife protect his reputation over her ability to seek out support from friends over the trauma he has directly caused her with his addiction? Beyond the pale.\n\nYou don't get to create chaos and trauma in your spouse's life with your behavior and then demand she not be able to seek the support of her friends and family because discussing her trauma (AT YOUR HANDS) makes you look bad.", "Thank you! That's why I walked away from 12-step programs. The forced shame and constant self-blame is not healthy for everyone, maybe not anyone. Very few people recover long-term with this kind of program. And I was heavily involved in the recovery community for over 5 years. Lived and breathed it. These aspects of the program took a major toll on my mental health. If she truly cared about her husband's recovery (and his *life* is in the balance, let's not forget), she would try to be more considerate of his vulnerability in all this. It isn't all about her, even though she has most certainly been negatively affected by his alcoholism.

I saw the video like a million years ago.", "This is the response that shows the most understanding of the situation.", "Some spouses can be addicted to the partners alcoholism, and may at some level undermine new sobriety because of the change in dynamics. 41 days sober is pretty recent, and maybe the 2 of them need to talk it over, get his wife to explore al-anon meetings etc. My mom constantly undermined my dad's sobriety, she knew all the triggers, and he was trapped in guilt, shame, and failure. Paybacks are tempting but destructive for everyone concerned.", "> coming to this sub was a fucking mistake.\n\nYeah, he should be talking about this stuff in his meetings - IF he's going to them.", "Sorry, I am aware of that. People who have those traits are often alcoholics, but not all alcoholics have those traits.", "It's AITA and people are simply telling him he is TA. It's literally what the sub is for.", "Nope.

That certainly seems like a good idea. One model doesn't serve everybody.", "that was not my takeaway from 12-step programs, at all. I think the disease model of understanding helps to remove some of that shame, we're not bad people trying to get good, we're sick people trying to get well.

I found it very empowering, personally, and helped me to take responsbility for and with my life.", "I think this is it. Wife needs support and in this particuar instance, I think NAH. But in the future she would benefit from Alanon or another more anonymous support mechanism. That's not to say she can't ever talk to her friends, but it would honestly probably be healthy for her to have a separate source of support anyways. And it would allow her husband some dignity. I say this as both a recovering addict and ACOA.", "Dude came to ask if he was an asshole not to a forum for addiction support. I\u2019m telling him how his wife probably feels so actually someone with actual experience like me will be more helpful than your holier than thou attitude.\n\nKnow who told me that bottling up emotions about this is bad?? A therapist many many years ago, so no I don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong.", "I don't really get you're point. I was using an example to explain what I was talking about.
