{"id": 25426, "submission_id": "160cb7f", "title": "AITA For refusing to pay for a former friends daughters college?", "selftext": "I (M37) had a friend 'Roy' (M37) when I was in highschool. We were friends for years prior to graduating and remained friends some years after. I considered him my best friend. At one point he had a daughter, May, and I became her Godfather at his and his partners request.\n\nAt the time I was still living with a bunch of friends from highschool. One of which was my roommate Taylor and his brother Jordan. Roy split with his wife during this time, and since I was his closest friend, i convinced the other guys to let Roy move in. \n\nJordan had never liked me from the get go, and attempted to drive wedges between my friends and I. He did this whenever I wasn't around, and I didn't realize how bad it had gotten until it was too late. He'd make shrewd comments about my girlfriend being out of my league and my career amongst other things, and the few people who remained my friends told me in more detail that he lied about me (like saying i had trashed the kitchen, when it was really him), and despite them trying to defend me, their words fell on deaf ears. I was unaware, but apparently even Roy believed Jordan. \n\nOur lease was ending near this point and Jordan, Taylor, and Roy had plotted behind my back to kick me out. We lived in a 5 bedroom and one of our roommates was leaving, but because of Jordan, many of my friends were uncomfortable moving in with me. So they decided to kick me out to bring 2 new people in, informing me about a month before the lease ended. I was betrayed, and hurt, most of all by Roy, the person I considered a brother. \n\nAfter I got kicked out I struggled on my own for a while. I was 24 at the time, and I had a decent job, which is the only reason I made it on my own, even if it was just barely. That career set me up well for my future, to the point that I now live very comfortably, to say the least. \n\nFlash forward about 6 years later, and Jordan drunkenly told Taylor and Roy that he had purposely gotten me kicked out, and that devolved into him spilling his guts about the situation. Turns out he was jealous of my girlfriend (who is now my wife) and how 'easy' my life looked. Roy and the others attempted to reconcile, and though I tried, it never felt right. I remained low contact. \n\nThat brings us to now. May graduated and they asked me to help pay for her college since I'm her godfather. I refused, based on the events of over 10 years ago now, and the fact that i hadnt been treated like her godfather in over a decade. He, his family, and my mother all seem to think I'm in the wrong. My wife is pissy they have the balls to ask. I genuinely don't feel like I am but I'm sick of being pestered by so many. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA For refusing to pay for her college?", "created_utc": 1692906874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160cb7f/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_a_former_friends/", "score": 3632, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The nerve that they have to ask is so astonishing it makes me believe they think it\u2019s all water under the bridge. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s great for them but not for you. You were deeply hurt in more ways than one. And while you have moved on in life it does not reverse the hurt in the past. \n\nI would use this as an opportunity to voice your frustrations. Sit down with Roy and explain what happened from your point of view and how it made you feel. Explain that you do not feel comfortable giving money to someone who turned their back on you based on someone else\u2019s word.

If that's the case, then you're punishing May for Roy's behavior. \n\nI get that it sucks that Roy believed the BS, but it seems like Jordan is one of those people who could sell oceanfront property in Nebraska.

I dont doubt that he regrets what happened. But I cannot justify that much money based on him regretting the events and making no real effort to amend his mistakes. He has apologized, but he still lives with Jordan and Taylor and they are both heavy parts of his life. I can't be a part of that after what happened.", "Barely?  No, not barely.  OP is NTA by a very large margin.  Yes, OP stated that he absolutely would have paid for May's school if he was still close to Roy.  But he's not.  And he's not \"punishing\" May.  The reality is that Roy **chose** this outcome when he broke trust with OP and threw their long-term relationship under the bus in favor of some random asshat.  No relationship with Roy = no relationship with May.  While what her father did is definitely not May's fault, the fact is that OP has had no contact with this child for almost 3/4 of her life.  He doesn't know her, she doesn't know him.
