{"id": 25426, "submission_id": "160cb7f", "title": "AITA For refusing to pay for a former friends daughters college?", "selftext": "I (M37) had a friend 'Roy' (M37) when I was in highschool. We were friends for years prior to graduating and remained friends some years after. I considered him my best friend. At one point he had a daughter, May, and I became her Godfather at his and his partners request.\n\nAt the time I was still living with a bunch of friends from highschool. One of which was my roommate Taylor and his brother Jordan. Roy split with his wife during this time, and since I was his closest friend, i convinced the other guys to let Roy move in. \n\nJordan had never liked me from the get go, and attempted to drive wedges between my friends and I. He did this whenever I wasn't around, and I didn't realize how bad it had gotten until it was too late. He'd make shrewd comments about my girlfriend being out of my league and my career amongst other things, and the few people who remained my friends told me in more detail that he lied about me (like saying i had trashed the kitchen, when it was really him), and despite them trying to defend me, their words fell on deaf ears. I was unaware, but apparently even Roy believed Jordan. \n\nOur lease was ending near this point and Jordan, Taylor, and Roy had plotted behind my back to kick me out. We lived in a 5 bedroom and one of our roommates was leaving, but because of Jordan, many of my friends were uncomfortable moving in with me. So they decided to kick me out to bring 2 new people in, informing me about a month before the lease ended. I was betrayed, and hurt, most of all by Roy, the person I considered a brother. \n\nAfter I got kicked out I struggled on my own for a while. I was 24 at the time, and I had a decent job, which is the only reason I made it on my own, even if it was just barely. That career set me up well for my future, to the point that I now live very comfortably, to say the least. \n\nFlash forward about 6 years later, and Jordan drunkenly told Taylor and Roy that he had purposely gotten me kicked out, and that devolved into him spilling his guts about the situation. Turns out he was jealous of my girlfriend (who is now my wife) and how 'easy' my life looked. Roy and the others attempted to reconcile, and though I tried, it never felt right. I remained low contact. \n\nThat brings us to now. May graduated and they asked me to help pay for her college since I'm her godfather. I refused, based on the events of over 10 years ago now, and the fact that i hadnt been treated like her godfather in over a decade. He, his family, and my mother all seem to think I'm in the wrong. My wife is pissy they have the balls to ask. I genuinely don't feel like I am but I'm sick of being pestered by so many. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA For refusing to pay for her college?", "created_utc": 1692906874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160cb7f/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_a_former_friends/", "score": 114, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The nerve that they have to ask is so astonishing it makes me believe they think it\u2019s all water under the bridge. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s great for them but not for you. You were deeply hurt in more ways than one. And while you have moved on in life it does not reverse the hurt in the past. \n\nI would use this as an opportunity to voice your frustrations. Sit down with Roy and explain what happened from your point of view and how it made you feel. Explain that you do not feel comfortable giving money to someone who turned their back on you based on someone else\u2019s word.

I dont doubt that he regrets what happened. But I cannot justify that much money based on him regretting the events and making no real effort to amend his mistakes. He has apologized, but he still lives with Jordan and Taylor and they are both heavy parts of his life. I can't be a part of that after what happened.", "Barely?  No, not barely.  OP is NTA by a very large margin.  Yes, OP stated that he absolutely would have paid for May's school if he was still close to Roy.  But he's not.  And he's not \"punishing\" May.  The reality is that Roy **chose** this outcome when he broke trust with OP and threw their long-term relationship under the bus in favor of some random asshat.  No relationship with Roy = no relationship with May.  While what her father did is definitely not May's fault, the fact is that OP has had no contact with this child for almost 3/4 of her life.  He doesn't know her, she doesn't know him.  OP is not responsible for financially contributing to May just because Roy is crawling out of the woodwork to ask for a handout.", "Just because he would have doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a set expectation or duty he took on as a godfather, he\u2019s just a nice person. \n\nI\u2019m sorry, but Roy is out of his mind if he thinks you should pay for his kids college. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be looking at reuniting with Roy either.\nHis actions now about college and believing Jordan makes me think the friend you knew a long time ago is well gone.\n\nNTA", "Someone who didn\u2019t save for their own kid\u2019s education", " NTA \n\nListen to your wife who has been by your side when your best friend who knew you better than anyone stabbed you in the back.  Your ex best friends entitlement is astounding, so are you just supposed to forget all the hurt he has caused you and the fact that due to his actions, you had no relationship with your godchild all those years and quite happily hand over your money.......just no.\n\nAnd all those people saying you should pay well turn it round on them and ask them how much they are willing to pay, I bet you the excuses will be fast and furious.", "Really it\u2019s difficult to think they would do this? Really? Why? They have shown you who they truly are and it\u2019s not your friend.", "If you didn\u2019t have money, do you think they\u2019d even be reaching out right now? Like they already knew everything was bullshit like 10 years ago and they made hardly any attempt at reconciliation. The only difference now is it\u2019s time to pay for college.", "\"Stop trying to make fetch happen, Gretchen!\"", "That makes sense, and is, I suppose, why the background context matters. But, I'd say you wouldn't even BTA if you were on good terms and didn't, because it's a somewhat odd ask.", "If you feel like it and can afford it, you could  always contribute directly to May's education in some way... Wouldn't go anywhere near those snakes though, you'd have to find some way to do it without them which could be difficult... hmm what's Roy's ex wife like? \n\nEither way you NTA but doing nice things for others is always good for the soul\n\nBest of luck x", "They just want your money. Don't listen to them. Cut them off, go NC. And if your mom is on their side, cut her off too. Your wife is the only one in your corner anyway. NTA", "Show your wife you have a back bone and you\u2019re done with these fake friends. You have a real one there, OP! Ps. I love that you married your then hot gf that Jordan was ogling & was jealous about and are now making great money - Jordan must be extra envious! Happiness and success is the best revenge.", "It\u2019s not normal and you don\u2019t owe them shit.", "It's still weird that they are not only asking but trying to demand this. Lots of godmothers and godfathers in our family, and  it's never a heavy-lifting role.", "Nah, I have had more satisfaction after looking at someone asking for something like this (similar story) and then just turning away.  Pissed them off more than me reacting.", "I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if Roy going through the separation while you\u2019re in a healthy relationship that he was jealous of the relationship, not your gf like Jordan. But do not back down. They deserve nothing from you.", "Is Roy from a traditional Indian household?", "If you must, give the girl (her not her father x money, like a gift and not the -amount of the college fee). In my culture goodparents only take care of godchilds if their parents die when they are children (under 21 yo), sometimes we give gifts like little money or toys, but they give us too (small things like flowers). Then go NC with the traitor.\nEither way your NTA", "So after everything Roy has remained friends with Jordan, and still has the audacity to ask you to pay for his daughter\u2019s college?!?!\n\nNTA every day of the week!!!", "Well that says everything.  Roy is no friend and wants your money and is using May and your mother to guilt you.  You have no obligation to these people.  They treated you horribly and have hadno contact for almost 10 years.  I know this hurts you but your wife is right.", "I bet all the money I have that Roy heard about your generosity and this is why he reached out", "Ok, I see. Still absolutely NTA and your mom is wrong in her opinion and, really, wrong to be involved at all. Also, Roy's parents were not very involved but now they are? Funny how that goes.", "Okay, I can get that. As long as he is still in contact with someone like that it's near impossible to get past it or trust them. If he kicked Jordan out as soon as he heard, then I might consider forgiving him.\n\nStill, you don't have to have contact with Roy to have contact with May. You could reach out to May and have a relationship with her in spite of how you feel about her dad. You could talk to her and tell her that you'd be there for her and decide on an appropriate gift towards her future.", "You missed the point completely. Fortunately, OP understood.", "You're right. Honestly, thinking about it, it makes me really proud she has my back. I couldn't ask for a better spouse. She is everything. I'm proud to call myself hers. And that is also a great point. It isn't some small fee, May is going to need a lot for her engineering classes, I don't know how much anyone else is even contributing", "I am a bit of a push over. I try to see the best in people, despite the horrible things they've done.", "No. He is African American. Roy is a fake name.", "That is honestly a fantastic idea. I know May's mother, and though I don't have the best relationship with her, I'm sure she'd be happy at that. May's mother 'Jenny' has been separated from Roy for years now, so she may be able to get me in contact. I know they have split custody until she leaves for college.", "May isn\u2019t being punished. It was never her godfathers job to pay for her college - I got it\n\nIf he had stayed close friends with Roy and actually been present in her life and loved the family\u2026. yea he probably would have paid for her college, on the basis he\u2019s a nice guy. \n\n\u2026but none of that happened.", "It's not normal or typical for godparents to contribute to their godchild's college even if they are an active part of their lives. That's crazy town talk. You'd have no obligation whatsoever even if all that crap hadn't gone down.", "And then you can be sure that you're just getting HER something, rather than paying for college so that dipshit (I mean Roy) doesn't have to.", "I think you should be careful here. They already believed Jordan once. He can and will most likely turn any attempt to connect with May against you.\n\nJust be careful."]}
