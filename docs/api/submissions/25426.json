{"id": 25426, "submission_id": "160cb7f", "title": "AITA For refusing to pay for a former friends daughters college?", "selftext": "I (M37) had a friend 'Roy' (M37) when I was in highschool. We were friends for years prior to graduating and remained friends some years after. I considered him my best friend. At one point he had a daughter, May, and I became her Godfather at his and his partners request.\n\nAt the time I was still living with a bunch of friends from highschool. One of which was my roommate Taylor and his brother Jordan. Roy split with his wife during this time, and since I was his closest friend, i convinced the other guys to let Roy move in. \n\nJordan had never liked me from the get go, and attempted to drive wedges between my friends and I. He did this whenever I wasn't around, and I didn't realize how bad it had gotten until it was too late. He'd make shrewd comments about my girlfriend being out of my league and my career amongst other things, and the few people who remained my friends told me in more detail that he lied about me (like saying i had trashed the kitchen, when it was really him), and despite them trying to defend me, their words fell on deaf ears. I was unaware, but apparently even Roy believed Jordan. \n\nOur lease was ending near this point and Jordan, Taylor, and Roy had plotted behind my back to kick me out. We lived in a 5 bedroom and one of our roommates was leaving, but because of Jordan, many of my friends were uncomfortable moving in with me. So they decided to kick me out to bring 2 new people in, informing me about a month before the lease ended. I was betrayed, and hurt, most of all by Roy, the person I considered a brother. \n\nAfter I got kicked out I struggled on my own for a while. I was 24 at the time, and I had a decent job, which is the only reason I made it on my own, even if it was just barely. That career set me up well for my future, to the point that I now live very comfortably, to say the least. \n\nFlash forward about 6 years later, and Jordan drunkenly told Taylor and Roy that he had purposely gotten me kicked out, and that devolved into him spilling his guts about the situation. Turns out he was jealous of my girlfriend (who is now my wife) and how 'easy' my life looked. Roy and the others attempted to reconcile, and though I tried, it never felt right. I remained low contact. \n\nThat brings us to now. May graduated and they asked me to help pay for her college since I'm her godfather. I refused, based on the events of over 10 years ago now, and the fact that i hadnt been treated like her godfather in over a decade. He, his family, and my mother all seem to think I'm in the wrong. My wife is pissy they have the balls to ask. I genuinely don't feel like I am but I'm sick of being pestered by so many. \n\nSo Reddit, AITA For refusing to pay for her college?", "created_utc": 1692906874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/160cb7f/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_a_former_friends/", "score": 576, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The nerve that they have to ask is so astonishing it makes me believe they think it\u2019s all water under the bridge. If that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s great for them but not for you. You were deeply hurt in more ways than one. And while you have moved on in life it does not reverse the hurt in the past. \n\nI would use this as an opportunity to voice your frustrations. Sit down with Roy and explain what happened from your point of view and how it made you feel. Explain that you do not feel comfortable giving money to someone who turned their back on you based on someone else\u2019s word.

I dont doubt that he regrets what happened. But I cannot justify that much money based on him regretting the events and making no real effort to amend his mistakes. He has apologized, but he still lives with Jordan and Taylor and they are both heavy parts of his life. I can't be a part of that after what happened.", "Barely?  No, not barely.  OP is NTA by a very large margin.  Yes, OP stated that he absolutely would have paid for May's school if he was still close to Roy.  But he's not.  And he's not \"punishing\" May.  The reality is that Roy **chose** this outcome when he broke trust with OP and threw their long-term relationship under the bus in favor of some random asshat.

So absolutely NTA, however, have you considered talking to May and explaining that her father is responsible for you two not having had a relationship these past 10 years and that you\u2019re proud of her and rooting for her?  If she\u2019s not like her family, she will graciously accept the well wishes and perhaps chose to have a relationship with you. If she acts entitled and is rude, we\u2019ll- you tried and it\u2019s clear the apple didn\u2019t fall from the tree. I only suggest this because you seem to have cared for her and everyone can always use words of encouragement. Absolutely under no circumstances offer to help pay her college. I\u2019m sorry but that shouldn\u2019t be why someone wants to have a relationship with you.", "Also why don't Roy and Taylor take ownership of their own actions? They're grown adults no? I wouldn't put it all on Jordan to be honest, they sound terrible in their own right.", "Kinda makes you wonder how genuine his \"apology\" was then", "Be there is picking her up from college for break if the parents cannot.  It is not paying for her college.", "Do not be part of their lives, they only reason they have reached out to you is the money.  With out a doubt you know that as soon as the last term of school is paid for you will not be contacted again.", "You're right. She should be home any minute and I will be ecstatic to discuss this with her. I'm head over heels for the woman, and this whole situation just reinforces it. She is always my biggest supporter. And in my opinion she's still just as gorgeous as she was when we started dating 17 years ago. More so, even. She's absolutely brilliant. \n\nThis was the first real challenge of our relationship because I was incredibly depressed afterwards, and I didn't mean to, but a lot of my burden was placed on her and my therapist. She took it in strides when anyone else would have probably left my ass. She got me through one of the darkest times of my life. And I will be forever grateful to her. \n\nIt's funny you mention Jordan being envious. When Roy and Taylor reached out and told me Jordan had confessed, it was because he was drunk and crying about how he still works at a restaurant and how it was all my fault somehow and how he was glad he got me kicked out, and that I didn't deserve my wife or my job. After his confession, and my subsequent timidness in reconnecting, he said I ruined his life because his relationship had apparently soured with most of my former friends because they were upset that our friendship had been ruined and they blamed him for me not wanting to reconnect, including Taylor (the only reason Taylor doesn't ditch him is because they are actual brothers)", "My wife recently got home and her and I had a lengthy discussion. We have agreed we will be talking to May and trying to establish a relationship with her, through her mother, Jenny. We have agreed we will not be paying for her college, but we would like to be a part of her life if she wants us.", "\"Call yourself hers\"  I love that!  NTA. I'm sorry you went through that, but you have a treasure there.", ">I don't know how much anyone else is even contributing\n\nIm'a go with a big fat ZERO and also go out on a limb and say Roy would've come out of the woodwork, hat in hand, expecting a payout even if he didn't apologize", "Why even try? They never tried to see the best in you and threw you to the streets.", "Wow, Jordan is an immature hater+ loser  & needs to not blame others for his own shortcomings. I love everything you said about your wife especially the absolutely brilliant bit \ud83d\ude2d! I hope you live a beautiful and long life beautiful \u2764\ufe0f", "My aunt if my sister godmother and she did contributed a lot towards her college education BUT she did it because they have always been close, shared life experiences and values, love each other dearly and my aunt really wanted to help my sister. My aunt was NEVER forced or pressured to do it by others, it was something between aunt and sis.\n\nNTA OP, you're NOT their wallet, you're NOT their cash cow and they CAN'T emotionally manipulate/guilt trip you to pay for a (currently) stranger education specially after being treated poorly.\n\nIf they really really want the money from you, give them a loan, make them and their child sing up a loan (you could be nice and not charge interest). Otherwise there's enough people there attacking you and if all of them contribute they can surely pay for education.", "I don't know honestly. You are right. I know you are. I just can't help but hope for the best. I'm naive.", "You can look for the best in people while still recognizing who is a *safe* person."]}
