I\u2019ve wanted to move out for a while to become more independent and experience what it\u2019s like to live alone, but whenever I brought it up with them, I left the conversation feeling guilty. \nMy dad is disabled and it\u2019s just my mom, my sister (7f) and I other than that. My mom needs to work, take care of my sister and everything around the house, which I understand can become very stressful. \n\n\nI wouldn\u2019t stop helping them out entirely, though. I found student housing less than two hours away, near my college. I\u2019ve been driving that distance twice a day for almost 2 years now. I could easily help them out whenever they need anything. \n\n\nWhen I told my parents about the place I found, they didn\u2019t take it well. My mom yelled at me.

He said he was disappointed in me and that he thought they raised me to be a better person than that. He said that I didn\u2019t need to come back if I left. It hurt. I was fighting back tears as I tried to bring up my arguments again, explain it in more detail, but they didn\u2019t listen. Even days later, bringing it up resulted in another shouting match. \n\n\nI\u2019m not sure what to do. All these fights are stressful for my sister and everyone involved and they don\u2019t accomplish anything other than making things worse. The mood is tense all the time now and I kinda regret bringing it up at all, but at the same time, I want to move on and grow. This might be selfish, but I feel suffocated at home, not because they aren\u2019t good parents, but because I am ready to have my own space where my every move isn\u2019t scrutinized and commented on. \n\n\nI feel like this post was all over the place, but I hope you could still follow along.

A few months ago she announced she\u2019s moving out in 2023 to live alone in her own place.  Since her announcement, her mom has NON STOP given her a guilty trip about how will she go back to paying 100% of the bills and being mean w/ comments like you won\u2019t make it by yourself and be right back here.

In which case nothing of value is lost.", "NTA - they are effectively asking you to put your life on hold forever. Your father sadly will always be disabled and your parents will always need your help. They are asking you to potentially not to marry, not to chase jobs away from home, not to have children and never leave them. You are the child they choose to have. They can't force the responsibility on you to look after them forever because of that. And your father's threat to disown you because your main value to him is as a helpmate is terrible. \n\nThis sticking plaster on the fact that your Mother can't look after your father and sister on own is going to need ripped off sometime. Your sister may be old enough in 7 years to look after self but you'd be 28 then and your Dad's needs may get more intensive as he ages depending on disability. Now is as good a time as any. However,I do worry about your sister. She's going to get sucked into the same mess as a replacement you. Try and stay in touch with her so you can be a safe landing when she is ready to leave. \n\nAs to our parents, look into adult services/after-school clubs in your area.

They should be encouraging you to go an explore the world and learn new things. Technically they say at 21 you\u2019re an adult. But THEY are. And they should be proud of you for achieving what you have. I\u2019m truly disappointed in them for making you feel guilty and second guess yourself. Sure sometimes things happen in life. But they chose to get married and have kids. You have no obligations. If they suck you in now you\u2019ll never be free.

Unless I misinterpreted what you said, you have been commuting 3-4 hours every time you go to your school, which is terrible. You deserve to move out, and you will be much better off and be able to more fully participate in your education if you do.

Your parents are expecting you to put their needs above your own for a good chunk of your life. That is unreasonable of them to ask of you.\n\nYou are driving 4 hours a day going to uni, have a part-time job, and are helping out around the house. You must be exhausted. Do you have any time for yourself? Of course you want to live on your own so you can concentrate on uni. There are so many opportunities there that you are missing out on just by not living close and not having time to do anything for yourself.\n\nI have a lot of empathy for your mom. She has a lot on her plate, but it is her plate. Her life choices have brought her to this point. It is up to her to access resources for your sister. For instance there are after school programs your sister could attend. I know people with disabled partners who have been able to manage several kiddos, and a full-time job. Your parents can do it. It is not going to be as easy and convenient as having an unpaid adult child living with them, but that is part of being an adult, doing the hard things. You do that everyday with all that you do, I am sure they can step up and parent their own 7 year old daughter.", "NTA.  Please go.

My mom especially does that sometimes when she\u2019s upset. I always feel sorry for my sister when she gets yelled at for something trivial because she\u2019s stressed. I can understand that being in a bad mood can do that to people, but if I leave that\u2019s a major cause for a bad mood. I\u2019m afraid my sister will have no one to turn to when she\u2019s sad because of something my mom said.", "I take care of my sister a lot, but it\u2019s mainly because my mom and dad are usually busy with work when school ends for my sister. I honestly don\u2019t mind. The only problem is that I sometimes have to leave college early to pick her up. But she\u2019s adorable and well-behaved for her age. \nI help her with her schoolwork and make her something to eat usually, but there isn\u2019t much more to help her with. \n\nBut I can understand that not having me around would make that part especially hard. They\u2019d probably have to find someone else to do it.", "I\u2019m worried about my sister too. It\u2019s hard to stay in touch with a 7 year old that doesn\u2019t have a phone. \nI could teach her how to write emails and maybe she could do that at a school computer, but I\u2019m not sure how well that\u2019d work. \n\nBut maybe my parents won\u2019t be against visits once they calmed down. I mean I can still help out even if I live somewhere else.", "Your sister is 7.  Lets say it's until she is 18.  That's 11 years.  You will be about 32.  Is that when you want to start living your life?\n\nIf your parents said until she is 10 that might be reasonable but given they haven't said anything it's a bit suss.\n\nYour future partner, if you are inclined to date, won't want to live with your parents.  Intimacy will be an issue.   Privacy will be an even bigger one.  Anything you purchase will be commented on.  You may lose out on job and other opportunities if you can't move and so on.  Some, if not all of, your friends will move on (yes some people keep childhood friends but most don't).\n\nNot to mention that the scholarships are awarded when they are awarded.  They don't get put on the backshelf and handed out again when your parents are ready to let you go.\n\nNTA.\n\nI suspect this will be a drama for a while.  Move and call home regularly to see if they need any help.  Ignore any guilt tripping.", "Your sister isn't your child, she's their's. You have to start the next phase of your life. Don't let them hold you back. Fly from that nest.", "When they tell you that you should be grateful for \u201call they did for you\u201d, remind them that you didn\u2019t choose to be born and they did what they were legally and morally obligated to do when they chose to have children. You don\u2019t owe them for their choices.", "They want you to stay until she is 18. Or even longer. Don't wait. You deserve to live your life.", "OP, you sound like a bright kid. Don't dim your light. Move out and enjoy some freedom.\n \nNTA.", "Think it through cuz it's your life and you are living it. Sometimes people say stuff like that but don't mean it but sometimes they doean it. You know them the best. See if you can stand up these few years while you are in school and after that move out with or without their blessing", "OP can I suggest getting counseling?  If your school has a Behavioral Science dept then most likely they offer counseling services to students as a part of your tuition.  Even if they don't have BS dept. its a good idea to look into it and don't forget, teletherapy is a thing now.\n\nI'm suggesting this because what you take as normal (because of conditioning) the rest of us see as abnormal.  The whole purpose of your existence is to become an independent, thriving individual who contributes to society.  It is a normal rite of passage into adulthood for most cultures.  What you're currently experiencing is a unhealthy, controlling environment where any attempt for independence is met with abusive, manipulative behavior.   It is unnecessary to yell at a normal occurrence unless the actual intention is to manipulate to get your way.  \n\nThere are many ways to manipulate.  Some use the silent treatment, some cry and get upset, some use words like \"if you loved me you would.....\".  Finally some scream and yell and intimidate.  All are predicated on teaching the victim to back down, cower and avoid any action that will cause these reactions.  You've been conditioned to think this behavior is normal when I assure you it is NOT.  That's why I'm suggesting therapy.....so you can get a different perspective.", "I'm so sorry for what you're going through. Please know that, while you might be in a position to help her at some point (and if you can, that's great of course), you're not responsible for the actions of your parents. They should have been/be the adult in this situation.", "You can stay in touch with Sis. Especially when moms at work. You\u2019re smart you\u2019ll figure out a way. Right now go", "Just know that it is not your fault, and realistically they should've been preparing for this. Did they expect you to stay home after uni too? Try to enjoy this rite of passage as you experience adulthood!", "NTA OP  when people start with that 'you're just lazy' trash it's simple gaslighting. Please do for yourself it's the best way to do for the family. Who can help more? A kid with no education or a career professional.", "NTA.  A 7 year old is not that helpless. She will be fine.  You need to move closer to your school and go on to the next stage of your life.", "NTA. You are not responsible for paying back your parents for raising you. What an outdated statement to make. It was their choice therefore their financial decision. Move out and live your best life.", "-Wait 6 months to a year before you move out. Give them time to adjust and plan for your absence, maybe hire a neighborhood teen to help with chores or caring for your dad and sister.\n\n-Talk to your parents about why you feel \u201cscrutinized and commented on.\u201d If they want you to stay, they need to respect you, not scream at you. \n\n-You\u2019re going to move out eventually. By the looks of it you\u2019re graduating college soon anyway. Considering you\u2019re driving this distance, this move shouldn\u2019t be a big deal; they\u2019re just perceiving it as a symbol of abandonment. They need emotional reassurance, and that can\u2019t happen until they take time to calm down.\n\nIf you leave your family now, you will lose them forever, including your sister.", "NTA\n\nYou have no responsibility in respect of supporting your parents household and you owe them nothing in return for fulfilling their legal responsibility to you as your parents.", "NTA. Your mom has some nerve. You're not avoiding YOUR responsibilities, she's piling HERS on top of you and berating you for not being available enough. You seem like a very responsible young adult, but at this point you should really only be responsible for yourself. It's wonderful that you make time to commute back and forth to help, but at some point that might not be possible for you to do and maintain your grades in school. I get that your mom is overwhelmed, but she needs to figure it out. Maybe there are social services that could help her in this situation, but they have to figure it out for themselves. You shouldn't put your life on hold for a situation that is not yours to solve. Please get some counseling to help you learn to set some healthy boundaries.", "NTA, it's not your job to \"help\", You're a grownup with your own life now.", "It\u2019s not concern for you. It\u2019s concern for themselves. You do not owe them anything for raising you. Becoming parents was their choice.\n\nYou would be able to help them more after you graduate. Don\u2019t delay your future \u2014 it will ALWAYS be more convenient to them for you to stay. Your sister is their responsibility. Should you stay until she\u2019s 12, 16, 18 or gets married and moves out?\n\nThey will always have a reason (excuse) for you not to move out.", "Quit talking about moving out and quietly make plans. Get all of your important documents together and make sure you are the only person with access to your money. Their talk of disowning you and saying to not to come home again are extremely manipulating. Get your belongings and anything you don't want thrown out and leave very quietly.\n\nIf they make good on their promise of cutting you off, that means they were NEVER going to let you leave until they were dead and gone and your sister grown. If you give in to them now, you will never be able to leave. NTA", "The thing is that you will be unable to help your sister, except for a little encouragement, until you help yourself become an independent person. Once you get in a stable place, you can at least give your sister a safe place to go when she's upset.", "I suspect once you are out and aggro dies out again, they will be in touch because, being blunt, they have limited alternatives. If they want time away for something, then it is ask you or pay for a babysitter. You are in for a rough period but suspect you are too useful to them for them to leave you totally alone. Think now about what you can realistically offer and hold to that.\n\nWas thinking limited pay as you go phone for sister, depending on maturity, but she might be punished. Email is good. I know snail mail looked down on but a stash of letter paper in prepaid envelopes would let her write you weekly at least."]}
