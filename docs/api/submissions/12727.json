My baby was in the NICU the first few weeks of his life. I\u2019ve finally been able to introduce him to people. I\u2019ve been having him meet with close friends in my life one-on-one so he and them can interact/meet/bond. \n\nI recently was able to finally find a time where close friend (Pam) and I were both able to meet up and have brunch, introduce my baby, etc. (it was planned about three weeks in advance because we are both so busy). \n\nA few days before the scheduled brunch, a mutual friend (Kelly) of ours found out that Pam & I were getting brunch so she could meet my baby. \n\nKelly got included in the brunch plans. I don\u2019t know what exactly the conversation was, I wasn\u2019t involved. I was told by Pam that Kelly asked to come, while Kelly told me Pam invited her. I was a little irked b/c I was looking forward to this time with Pam and having her meet baby for the first time. Kelly has already met my baby and she got a one on one meeting with him as everyone special in my life has. \n\nDespite how I felt, I updated our brunch reservation to include Kelly and her boyfriend as well, texted them the details of when we were meeting, and didn\u2019t think much of it. A day before the brunch, Kelly asked me via text: \u201cI know Pam invited me to join tomorrow. But I\u2019m feeling like maybe you wanted it to be just you and Pam? Or am I reading too much into it. I don\u2019t wanna impose if that\u2019s what you wanted to do tomorrow.\u201d \n\nI responded: \u201cHey! Pam and I planned this a little while back for her and (Pam\u2019s husband) to meet (baby) for the first time so I was looking forward to them having some one on one time, but it\u2019s not a problem at all, we can do it another time and I\u2019m excited to have a fun brunch with you!\u201d \n\nShe never responded to that text and ended up not coming. I felt something was up because she tends to be someone that has a lot of FOMO so I texted her after the brunch and said that I missed her at the brunch. She didn\u2019t respond, so 2 days later I texted \u201cwe good sis?\u201d She didn\u2019t respond again so I DM\u2019d her a few days later. I said I hoped everything was okay b/c I haven\u2019t heard from her. She responded with \u201cgotcha.\u201d And said that we could talk when she gets back from a trip she happened to be on at the time. \n\nShe has since not messaged me at all. I\u2019m confused because she asked me if it was ok if she comes, so I answered honestly. I\u2019m a people pleaser. she has repeatedly encouraged me to speak my truth and not be a people pleaser. Another mutual friend of ours told me that Kelly expected me say that it\u2019s okay that she comes so it\u2019s not awkward for her. If she had not asked, I honestly wouldn\u2019t have said anything, but I thought b/c she was asking, she was truly wanting to know my real feelings about the situation. Our mutual friend said that I made her feel \u201cnot wanted.\u201d  Im hurt that she\u2019s ghosting me. Should I have just lied and said I don\u2019t mind her coming so it wouldn\u2019t be awkward?", "created_utc": 1679279936, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11w625v/aita_for_not_wanting_a_friend_to_join_a_brunch/", "score": 59, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She\u2019ll either get over it or she won\u2019t.", "You\u2019re very clearly NTA here. She did impose, which is okay nothing inherently wrong with what she did. But since she imposed, when she messaged you asking if you were good with it, you are allowed to say how you feel. If your friend group is all around your age, they should have enough social experience to understand this and move on. They may feel left out, but they ought to have developed enough empathy to understand where you\u2019re coming from. \n\nSo long as everything happened pretty much exactly how you described it, NTA.", "NTA. Kelly is though. I\u2019m tired of people asking a leading question and then being upset if you didn\u2019t give them the precise answer they were fishing for. \n\nKelly obviously knew she inserted herself into a private lunch with you and Pam and she felt a bit guilty about it. As she should! You answered, yes it was originally just Pam and I (and husband), but it\u2019s fine if she (Kelly) comes and that you\u2019re excited.\n\nThat\u2019s literally the best, honest answer you could\u2019ve come up with and politely explains why Kelly wasn\u2019t invited in the first place. But because you didn\u2019t word it to assuage Kelly of ANY guilt, she felt slighted. That\u2019s 100% on her because you were rightfully irked and Kelly knew it, but she wanted you to pretend you weren\u2019t.", "NTA. She asked you answered. If she got upset that's on her.", "NTA. I'm surprised no one has mentioned this, but in the wake of a 3-year pandemic where not everyone has gotten vaccinated, you are completely correct insisting on one-on-one intros with baby. My feeling is that Kelly talked to Pam and found out about the brunch, asked if she could go too, and Pam said yes without running it by you first. Then Kelly found out about Pam not having cleared it with you and texted you to ask if it was ok. I personally would've had no problem saying, \"Sorry but this is my Pam time. We can have a lunch date some time next week.\" As you said, Kelly had already had her one-on-one. She was just moving in on your time with Pam and baby.", "i'm confused by this wording:\n\n>but it\u2019s not a problem at all, we can do it another time and I\u2019m excited to have a fun brunch with you!\n\ni'm reading this as you saying no problem, come join us for brunch tomorrow. so why would she be put off by that?! she met your baby one-on-one, so why would you prefacing this comment with 'yes i had originally planned on it being just pam & her husband' make her mad? obviously she knows this is how you're introducing the kid to people.\n\nshe sounds exhausting. you are NTA.", "NTA. She sounds petty and butthurt. She asked a question that she didn\u2019t really want an honest answer to as a means to \u201ctest\u201d you and then when you were open about your reality she took it personally.\n\nI get feeling awkward, but if I had been in her shoes and you had texted me that, I\u2019d have said \u201cdude NO WORRIES you guys have your solo lunch so Pam can get some precious baby snuggles like I did! But PLEASE let\u2019s put another lunch on the calendar for all of us when I get back from my work trip/when you have time! \ud83e\udd70\u201d\n\nYou were super kind and accommodating through that whole interaction. Her response was toxic, unfair, and immature. Hard NTA.", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t even tell her she couldn\u2019t come. You told her what the original plan was after she explicitly asked, but you were super gracious about it.\n\nHer reaction was super childish, I get being hurt by not being invited somewhere, but being a grown up means being able to identify those feelings and dealing with them. Even if you didn\u2019t have a baby sometimes it\u2019s nice to have some one on one time with friends, not because one doesn\u2019t like the others, but because it\u2019s quality time", "I\u2019m going to hope there is another reason Kelly is not messaging you, because if it\u2019s the brunch thing she is being a serious AH. How dare she encourage you to work on your people pleasing, ask for your honest feedback about a brunch and then stonewall you for giving it? That\u2019s just unkind and Kelly can\u2019t have it both ways. You are NTA here and good for you for communicating your feelings. Other people may not always like it, but your feelings and needs are a-ok! Congrats on being a mom!!!", "NAH / ESH\n\nKelly asked a question & got an answer. Her reaction is her choice. If she chooses to be hurt by your response ... she\u2019s an adult, she can communicate like one. She knew you were annoyed.\n\nYou state you were \u201cirked\u201d by Kelly joining & your text response was clearly intended to let her know that but you were trying to be nice by allowing her to join. Don\u2019t be upset that your friend understood your message loud & clear. You wanted her to know you were annoyed.\n\nSeems like Pam is the real issue here. Kelly either asked to join & was told yes by Pam or was invited by Pam. Think you should\u2019ve either canceled with Pam, had Pam cancel with Kelly or just accepted Kelly was joining & brunch was not going to be a one on one meeting for baby anymore.\n\nedit", "Seems odd to me that you would make an effort to set up exclusive individual baby meet and greets with each of your friends. Maybe if your friends aren't friends with each other it would make sense, or if this was some kind of tradition or something, but that isn't the case here. Why would your baby need specific one on one bonding time with your friends? Can Kelly not be present when the baby meets Pam? \n\nMy guess is that Kelly just wanted to get together and maybe was excited to see the baby again and she is probably thinking...What the heck is the big deal with these individual baby meets?\n\nI am sure your friends all love your new bundle of joy, and becoming a parent is a wonderful event that you should experience in whatever way makes you happiest. Just be aware that choices you make that may seem special and eventful to you could come off as pretentious to others. \n\nI'll say NAH because you can celebrate parenthood as you choose, and Kelly can also choose not to participate.", "NTA, you went out of your way to compromise and included them, if she needed that much validation, she knew she was prob doing too much in the first place, and she prob did invite herself. Being honest doesn\u2019t make you a jerk. Also, it seems like the sentiment of you wanting everyone to meet up w your baby one on one is something that you\u2019ve prob reiterated to people. So it seems like she chose to ignore that and overstep. \nQuestion tho, did you want everyone to meet the baby one on one bc he\u2019s immunocompromised still? Or strictly for bonding just curious", "NTA. The whole meeting your baby one on one thing is a little weird but it doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "NTA. It\u2019s your kid and you\u2019re allowed to set whatever conditions you want. She messaged you making it seem like she would be okay with just you and Pam going. Don\u2019t ask questions if you can\u2019t handle the answer.", "NTA. Kelly shot herself in the foot, figuratively, and is now mad. That\u2019s her problem all the way around. If she didn\u2019t want to know the answer, she shouldn\u2019t have asked the question. She seems manipulative to me because she\u2019s waiting for *you* to apologize for her actions. Don\u2019t do it.", "NTA. Ok I couldn\u2019t keep things super straight but I got the gist. Girl. RELAX. Hormones!!! They are a killer!  First off. The only bonding happening is you and the baby. The baby has no idea who these people are. The get togethers are for you.  Not the baby. 2nd. You speak how you feel and stop stressing. If anyone gives you sh\u00a1t blame it on hormones and move on. Enjoy the baby!!!.", "ESH. Kelly shouldn't have invited herself along and also shouldn't be so sensitive about it. Pam shouldn't have allowed Kelly to invite herself and then put it on you to cancel. And you shouldn't be so weird about meeting your baby one on one. I've never heard of anyone doing that. I understand that baby was in the nicu so meeting people was limited for awhile, but if you're meeting individually with many people in public places, clearly germs, etc is no longer a HUGE concern so why be so weird about it?", "ESH. Kelly is clearly being too sensitive. Wanting to do a 1:1 plan with your other friend isn\u2019t such a crime that she should be cutting off the friendship, it\u2019s absurd. \n\nI think you also need to gain some perspective that  while your baby is the most important thing in your life, and occupying 99% of your thoughts, that is not the case for your friends.\n\nYour baby isn\u2019t bonding with your friends in these introductions and you\u2019re assigning a meaning to these interactions that likely is not reciprocated. I\u2019m sure your friends are excited to meet the baby, but much more than that they simply want to support you as their friend.\n\nKelly was not trying to get \u201cextra time with the baby when it wasn\u2019t her turn,\u201d she was just trying to be your friend. So when she got disinvited to a brunch at a restaurant, I can see why her feelings were hurt.", "NTA. You are being selective about who bets to meet your son and when. That's what new parents do. Kelly asked if you were okay with her coming and you gave her an honest answer. You did nothing wrong.", "NAH. I\u2019ve never heard of one-on-one introductions for babies, but I\u2019m all about you doing you. However Kelly clearly got the \u201cI\u2019m not welcome\u201d message whether from a mutual friend that you vented to or by you acting in such a way. Your confirmation of her being uninvited is bound to give her feelings if she doesn\u2019t understand your desire for one-on-ones. She\u2019s entitled to want some space from you after feeling unwanted. Perhaps a very open conversation laying everything on the table will allow everyone to move past this.", "It sounds like Pam invited her, which was really not Pam's call to make, and Kelly picked up on the vibe and contacted you to check if it was okay.\n\nReally the only thing that you did that was sort of AH-ish was to say \"we can do it another time\" (uninviting her), and then saying \"we missed you at brunch\" - if I were on the receiving end of that, I'd feel like I was getting mixed messages, but it could be easily be an innocent mistake.\n\nOverall I'd say NTA, and maybe Pam is the only AH here for inviting Kelly without asking you.", "Hmm. To me, I feel like you\u2019re NTA. Is it a little weird that you only want your friends to meet your child one-on-one? Sure. But is it an AH move? I don\u2019t think so. If there wasn\u2019t a child involved and you wanted to just have brunch with Pam, I feel like no one would say you were the AH for letting Kelly know (when she asked) that you were trying to just hang out with Pam but would be happy to hang out with her another time. I\u2019m not sure. I feel like Kelly\u2019s response is a bit extreme.", "NTA-she\u2019s a drama queen and expects you to read her mind. You haven\u2019t lost anything.", "NTA people who are used to having their way do not like boundaries, you subtly let Kelly know she overstepped. Good for you!! Too bad she\u2019s butthurt, she intruded in on Pam\u2019s time and not only that, invited her boyfriend. She\u2019s hella rude!\n\nI just read something interesting that people pleasing is actually a learned fawn response to abuse, that it\u2019s a way to avoid being subject to abuse. Something to unpack\u2026", "Omg your friends don't need to meet and bond with your newborn one on one.  \n\nUnless this is something your friend group does as a tradition, then the friend who wanted to join was an ah.  If this is a new tradition you are trying to start, YTA. You were supposed to say it is fine happy to have you there.\n\nEta, ok I will take my lumps here and downvotes.  If op and her friends are all good with one on ones op was NTA.  I still think it is silly but who am I to judge.", "You\u2019re NTA but she is likely not responding because of the passive aggressiveness. If she felt prior to the brunch that you didn\u2019t want her there (as she mentioned in that text), and your response, I wouldn\u2019t have come either and had an issue with \u201cyes come!\u201d even though I wasn\u2019t wanted.", "It sounds like an incredibly boring lunch.  I don\u2019t want to meet any newborn one on one over a period of 90 minutes. It sounds positively dreadful.", "NTA\n\nShe caught the vibe that she had imposed, and she had, so she asked, and you told the truth, but you weren't rude about it. You were not wrong by not making it weird by telling her she wasn't welcome to come when your other friend had invited her/she asked to tag along/however it came about, you sucked it up and welcomed her. Even after she asked, you still welcomed her. I wouldn't blame her for being a tiny bit hurt or embarrassed, but she overreacted 100%.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It\u2019s possible that some sort of interaction between Pam and Kelly sparked this question from her, maybe to ease some guilt or something idk, but either way that doesn\u2019t really fall on you since you did a good job communicating! As you said, Kelly got her one on one time already so there\u2019s really no reason for this passive aggressiveness.

She invited herself to brunch, what does she expect when she asks you?", "YTA for not clearly stating it was a prearranged one on on meetup when she was first included instead of passive aggressively skulking until she got the hint. You only ever said something when she read between the lines.\n\nLook at it from her point of view. She's talking with her friend who mentions she's going out with you. One way or other, she gets invited to go. You end up acting in a way that makes it clear that she's not welcome, but you never actually say anything. She eventually had to bring up your anger herself.", "Nta I understand your conserns cause I'm a people pleaser as well (therapy helped a lot tho).

I told her my true feelings but welcomed her and also included her on the reservations. I never assumed she was trying to get extra time with the baby. I assumed because she is someone with FOMO and saw two friends hanging out and wanted to join in. \n\nI also am an introvert that prefers smaller group settings and I\u2019m not ever assuming by my baby is most important to other people. I just prefer his introduction to be one on one with my friends that are special to me. Everyone else he\u2019s met in groups as the situation arises, and it\u2019s always spaced out for Covid safety so there\u2019s not a lot of interaction with people because of the larger group.", "Sorrry - maybe the text message wasn\u2019t clear. I meant in my response to Kelly that no worries, Pam and I could do our one on one another time and that I\u2019m looking forward to having everyone at brunch. I was trying to say basically \u201cyeah sure come along!\u201d I wasn\u2019t trying to invite her, I included her on the reservation too.", "I guess not everyone does it but I\u2019m more introverted and I don\u2019t do well in large group settings so it\u2019s more meaningful for me to have special people in my life meet my baby one on one.", "Haha I definitely have been unpacking my people pleasing in therapy. I\u2019m making strides so that is why I feel more brave to say no to things or say my true feelings (like I tried to in this situation but it didn\u2019t work out).", "I want them to meet one on one. That\u2019s just who I am. I had a tough four days of labor and a sick baby. It\u2019s meaningful for me this way and I\u2019m an introvert that doesn\u2019t do well in big groups. I don\u2019t think that has any bearing on the situation.", "She invited herself then got her feelings hurt when she called herself out on it. How is OP the ah at all? Their reply was more than civil considering it sounds like Kelly was trying to be sneaky inviting herself along when she'd already met the baby anyway.\n\n>Omg your friends don't need to meet and bond with your newborn one on one. \n\nAlso it's OP's baby, if everyone is fine with it, who gives an f? OP is NTA.", "Good, you weren\u2019t invited \ud83d\ude0c", "fomo = fear of missing out", "fomo is \"fear of missing out\"", "Yeah I think you are \u201cin the right\u201d here. But something I just thought of\u2014 Maybe she\u2019s been going through a tough time with work or relationship or family and she\u2019s projecting a little bit, this sounds like an atypical resposne to something like this when you were very respectful in how you responded.", "I assumed this whole post was about covid and rsv. Especially with a nicu baby. I'm was a little surprised when the post didn't go further into talking about that.", "I can see how I could have worded that better!", "Your needs are absolutely valid and you communicated them so kindly. I\u2019m angry on your behalf that this was the response you got, but I hope it doesn\u2019t stop you", "Concerns that the baby might get sick was not the reason why OP was \u201cirked.\u201d The reason given for the one-on-one meets is so they can \u201cinteract/meet/bond\u201d and Kelly has already gotten her one-on-one time. I get no big groups, but if you\u2019re meeting everyone anyway, you\u2019re not mitigating more risk by having one more person at the brunch, which is presumably at a restaurant with strangers all around you.", "Okay that\u2019s valid! Bc I was thinking the one on one was to limit contact to be able to track and such. But yes! I hope you\u2019re enjoying your new little one !", "You say you didn\u2019t disinvite her but you said you prefer she not join - it\u2019s the same thing. \n\nI understand where you are coming from. You were honest and wanted brunch with your other friend, which there\u2019s nothing wrong with those feelings. \n\nBut that simply isn\u2019t how it will be perceived from Kelly\u2019s perspective. She became part of a plan, on the reservation, then told your preference is she doesn\u2019t join. That was bound to hurt her feelings, and you being an introvert doesn\u2019t change that.", "Yeah I tried to read it both ways. This is totally subjective, but it felt to me like it was saying, \"Pam and I planned it to be one-on-one a while back. You and I can do it another time and I look forward to that time.\" It's really not that big of a deal either way - just saying that *might* be why she didn't show. I don't think you're an AH for it though.", "How many of your friends have kids and have you met each of them one on one as a newborn?\n\nLook, I get it.  I am a mom.  Miscarried, emergency c section, baby health issues. You finally get your baby home and it is this stellar deal for you to show her off.  But they are just another baby to everyone else.  Your baby, so special, but still just a baby that only sleeps and eats and pees at this stage.  \n\nIf it was to have a one on one with you to talk about how you are doing  I would totally get it.  But showing off your baby one on one and thinking they are going to bond, it just seems like you are heading down the path of entitled parents and I encourage you to avoid it.", "You\u2019re NTA though, you can do what you want and introduce your baby to people how you please and your text to her was very kind and diplomatic. \n\nA lot of my friends who don\u2019t have kids wanted to catch up and meet the baby but were positively glazing over at hearing about the hospital visit and downright terrified to hold her and only did so for long enough for me to eat with two hands.  You may have to face that your ideal introductions for the baby don\u2019t align with other peoples comfort.", "Thank you!", "Thank you!", "That\u2019s what I thought too and I know it was awkward hence why I reached out. I\u2019m just sad she\u2019s blowing me off.", "So to make sure I understand your perspective, I should have lied and not said it bothers me at all? \n\nAlso to clarify myself: I also didn\u2019t say I prefer she not join. I reiterated my original intentions for the plan but welcomed her to join.", "I\u2019ve actually met all my friends\u2019 babies one on one. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "Not getting your point here. Pam was very excited to meet my baby and spend time with him so it has nothing to do with her comfort?", "Not a problem!", "I feel you, but it happens. I\u2019m sure she\u2019ll come around. And if not, then I guess she probably wouldn\u2019t have been a great long term friend in the first place.", "You can think of it as lying, but I would see it as showing some grace to a friend instead of embarrassing them.\n\nWith a plan already made, yes, you just say \u201cbabyangrydecaf and I can\u2019t wait to see you.\u201d", "Lol ok you win.  To each their own!  Happy you and baby are home safe.  Cheers!", "I just mean that if you prefer one - on - one meets for your friends , and not just Pam that it\u2019s cool and all but I\u2019m just not that sure that everyone\u2019s going to be as excited about it as Pam and Kelly.  Live your life though.", "If you don't want to be embarrassed then don't invite yourself places. It's pretty easy to do.", "It\u2019s not everyone? I only have like 5 close friends that I\u2019m introducing him to this way?", "I suddenly see exactly why Pam didn\u2019t want to go to lunch alone and Kelly isn\u2019t replying any more.  Poor girl got dragged into this crap by Pam to be a buffer and regrets it.", "You\u2019re not responding in earnest you\u2019re being dense. Pam never said she wanted to go alone and even texted after that she loved our brunch. Stop responding if you\u2019re not going to be constructive with your feedback. I gave you clarifying facts that don\u2019t line up with your assumptions and you\u2019re being rude as a result."]}
