She gave you a problem, you gave her a solution, then she tried to cause another problem out of it. She sounds like a piece of work.\n\nThis is also why 17 year old's shouldn't be having kids.. choosing parties over your child is a \"childish\" argument to have in the first place.

LOL, she asked YOU to watch the baby on HER night, and on a night there a party YOU were planning on going to\u2026and she\u2019s complaining that you\u2019re helping out by getting your parents to sit?

You should go ahead and go to the party and let Jess figure things out for herself.", "NTA\n\nIf your parents have babysat before and she didn't articulate an objection, I don't understand why it's suddenly a problem now.

But if you are broken up, I can totally understand if she wanted to go to a party and not have her ex there, it could be awkward.", "NTA. Welcome to co-parenting with someone who\u2019s self absorbed. You had every right to go to the party. She can\u2019t ask you to not go so she can in her night she had her own child.

Talk to her about it calmly. Let her know she can hang out with your friends, and that you need a break as well.", "NTA - As parents you both can take a night out.

So I would just get that part out of your mind. It's unfair to both of you to say it's even 100% of the time. It's not a bad thing - just an impossible standard. \n\nYour parents agreed to babysit on a night that was HER night to begin with. You were responsible in getting childcare and you were even ok to stay home if you didn't. \n\nYou should go to the party - but I would see if you can find out the real reason she doesn't want you to go.

SMH", "ESH. I don't care how old y'all are, you made the choice to have this kid and now you have the responsibilities of a parent.
