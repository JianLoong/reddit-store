Both me and my spouse have insurance. \n\nA couple of months ago, my spouse, and I both tested positive for a viral infection. His was relatively minor, but I am on multiple immune suppressants, and that always makes viral infections worse for me. I was running a fever of 103 and I had the worst chills, and body aches. My work demanded a sick note. The only place I could get into on short notice was my local urgent care.\n\nNow, my spouse had just gone to see them for a sick note not even two weeks prior for the same illness. They saw him, tested him, and sent him home with a note. We got a bill in the mail a few days later asking for his co-pay.\n\nAt first, they tried to send me back outside to wait, and told me it would be a three hour wait. But one of the nurses noticed how bad my fever was, and how sick I was, and she immediately took me into a back room.\n\nThis is where the problem occurred. Before they even could do more than take my temperature, another nurse came in and told me that they weren\u2019t affiliated with my insurance. The nurse looked me dead in the eye and told me it would be $500 cash to be seen. I mentioned that my spouse had been seen, and successfully billed, not even two weeks prior. The nurse was adamant and told me that unless I paid upfront, I was not going to be seen that day.\n\nHere\u2019s where I know I was a jerk. I threw an absolute fit. I was sick, in pain, and feverish, and just not in the mood for dealing with this. I kept insisting that they re-check the insurance. They refused. They kept insisting that I go outside to the ATM and take out $500 cash, and then they would bill me the rest if I wanted to pay out of pocket . I ended up having my husband escort me out of the clinic while I yelled a few choice words. We ended up going down to the local ER, who admitted me for a couple of days.\n\nA week later, I received a survey from the urgent care clinics office. I was honest with my review and told the story about them asking for cash. A few days later, a supervisor followed up and asked for me to elaborate on the story. He said that their clinic doesn\u2019t do cash payments, and said that what I told him the staff did was highly against their policies. A few weeks later, he called to let me know that that nurse had been let go, and the rest of the staff had been retrained/reprimanded.\n\nI recently relayed the story to a few friends who work in the medical field. They told me I was an absolute jerk who got a nurse fired over something as simple as a clerical error. They told me that insurance is change in the middle of the year all the time. She said I shouldn\u2019t have made a stink and I shouldn\u2019t have complained in the survey because I got that nurse fired. But I didn\u2019t ask for the survey, I didn\u2019t actively seek out the clinic supervisor. I merely responded to what they sent me, I\u2019ll be it was automated. I didn\u2019t want to get the nurse fired, I was just trying to be honest.\n\nWITA?", "created_utc": 1680211659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126ztfu/aita_for_making_a_stink_at_urgent_care_because/", "score": 304, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

If the clinic legitimately needed an up-front payment from you for services, it could have been given in cash, debit card, or credit card - anything that debited that amount against you vs. the insurance company.

They do that when someone has clearly violated policies by taking advantage of sick people, and I doubt such a brazen attempt was the first time they\u2019d done it.

That seems so shady.  I think they were going to pocket your $500.     The fact it had to be cash is so sketchy.     Even if they wanted out of pocket funds you can pay by credit card.

If they can't get your insurance to pay for it, they just bill you afterward. The fact that they were trying to get you to pre-pay (with cash no less) is the biggest red flag.\n\nThe other red flag is that a \"nurse\" approached you about payment. Nurses never deal with insurance--it's a completely different skillset. Any time you try to talk to a nurse about payment or cost of care, they will immediately defer to the billing office.

The clinic doesn\u2019t do cash payments so she 100% knew what she was doing was wrong. And since when does an urgent care visit cost $500? I would escalate this further and file a complaint with the licensing office in your state against her and against anyone else working in the office at that time.

This nurse could truly kill someone.\n\nIt is INSANE your friends acted like you should protect someone who is entrusted with people's lives and is using their desperation to rip people off.", "NTA. Not even getting into how the us  healthcare system sucks. Nurses were scamming you. Given your friends reaction I wonder if they tried the same scam on someone desperate, and the \"clerical error\" was them not checking that your insurance had already been billed prior for your husband.", "NTA I\u2019m a medical admin assistant. I\u2019m the person who checks you in at the desk and runs your insurance. This is not a clerical error. This sounds like someone was hard up and tried to scam you for $500. You don\u2019t work at a clinic for more than an hour without knowing exactly what kind of payment they take.", "Yeah nurses are not involved in payment whatsoever. I think they tried to scam", "Yes, me and my husband have the same insurance. \n\nWe agree about the insurance changing in middle of the year being suspicious. I\u2019ve only ever heard of it happening in emergency cases and then it rolls over at the beginning of the new year. But it was the fact that my husband had been there just two weeks prior, that\u2019s what made it really suspicious. Why was his billable, but mine not?\n\nBut still\u2026 I was worried that I had overreacted. Based on everyone else agreeing, it was a scam, I feel a little better about how I did react. Minus the cursing and yelling.", "Huh?  Businesses do this all the time.\n\n\"Thank you for informing us of the problem.  We would like to assure you that the nurse is no longer an employee of our facility.  Please know that the health and safety of our patients is always our number one concern at AITA Urgent Care.  We have instituted a mandatory training for our staff in billing, to ensure that all staff members act fully in accord with our billing policy, which does not allow for any cash payments.\"\n\nSeriously, simply stating that the employee is no longer with the company is pretty much the standard business response to serious complaints.", "You did not get anyone fired. The employee who mishandled a situation got themselves fired.", "I\u2019m a nurse and trust me, people like the nurse who tried to scam you are like cockroaches. They will find another job, being a parasite elsewhere. Also, it\u2019s not a nurse\u2019s duty to collect payment. Their were multiple violations going on and that person deserved to be fired.", "YOU didn\u2019t get her fired.        \nShe did that herself.       \nNTA", "You didn't get anyone fired that nurse did it to herself. Also if she did it to you it's likely she did it to other people.", "Surely if someone is stealing money from patients and withholding medical care for people in the process, you would want them fired??", "Scammers deserve to get fired.", "Stealing from patients is definitely something people should be fired for. You did a really good thing reporting her", "If she was scamming you, that's a massive abuse of power. I can't say for certain she was scamming, but she could easily have pocketed the money and claimed you were delirious.\n\nIf they normally don't take cash payments, then they're not set up for any part of it - recording and securing cash payments, issuing receipts, counting the money, having someone transport it to the bank...\n\nThere's a truck load of admin involved in handling cash, and usually nurses don't touch it. For many reasons, one of which is that cash is unsanitary", "You didn\u2019t get anyone fired.  They got themselves fired.\n\nYou did a good deed.  Consider that if they hadn\u2019t been fired then they would have likely tried to rip more people off", "NTA OP.  It indeed sound like a scam.  Let me say as having worked in the medical field doing billing/coding, medical records, transcription and bed management, I know for a fact that nurses or medical assistants DO NOT come to a patient's room and ask them about payment.  That is the job of the front office staff, which should have been asked BEFORE you were placed in the room or even while you were in the room before being treated.  Case in fact, I saw my dentist this past Wednesday and the front desk billing clerk forgot to collect my co-pay, it was she who came to the room to inform me that she forget to collect my payment.  It was not the Doctor nor the Dental assistant who informed me but the front billing clerk.  I told her I would definitely stop at the front desk when doctor finish seeing me as I would be paying with my credit card and did not feel comfortable giving my card to someone while I'm not in their presence.", "Listen to what others are saying here. If their policy is that they don't require cash payments up front, and the nurse was doing this, she was almost certainly going to pocket the money. Especially since they wanted you to go to the ATM. I'm assuming you had a debit card if that's the case. I guarantee the urgent care accepts those, and probably would rather be paid that way than handle cash. The nurse was trying to steal money from you. A single incident doesn't get someone fired unless it's really serious. You're either one of many that have had this happen, or this nurse was doing something unthinkable.", "Why wouldnt you want to get someone fired who was trying to scam money from you in a vulnerable moment? That's literally nonsense. Good people don't stand for bad people and their BS.", "Not if it was over a clerical error. Like her miss reading my insurance eligibility. My nurse friends think I\u2019m over reacting to something as simple as her miss reading something on the computer. It just seems so suspicious\u2026..", "Thank you very much for your kind words\n\nI never did think about the ATM limits.\u2026", "Nurses don't handle billing. Have you ever had a nurse ask you for payment? I haven't - it's always been the front desk workers, at the front desk, with their computers open to the billing/insurance programs.\n\nYou weren't the straw that broke the camel's back. You weren't anything. Her manager found evidence of concerning and likely unethical behavior, followed up on that evidence and found truth, and fired someone who was trying to scam sick and vulnerable people out of money. That is a good thing and a good outcome. Lord knows how many other people she'd pulled that on.", "If the policy is they don\u2019t do cash payments, then she wasn\u2019t really fired for being mean to you. She was most likely fired for trying to embezzle money from patients instead of it going to the clinic. Sure, it was also abusive to you, but her trying to steal from her employer is gonna speed up that firing process quite a lot.", "She saw that you were sick to near death and decided to try and take advantage of you because she thought you were to sick to fight back. You probably saved a lot of other people from being ripped off or worse by someone with an anti-social disorder. You did nothing wrong, you did good.", "Your eligibility has nothing to do with the fact that they don\u2019t accept cash payments. That is a direct violation of their policies, so it was not an easy mistake to make. That means they don\u2019t have cash registers, or any other mechanisms in place to process cash payments, but there would absolutely be established procedures for handling patients paying out of pocket. She was trying to scam you.", "Refusing someone care is not a clerical error, it\u2019s unethical.  NTA.", "NTA. There is a thing called insurance fraud which is what happened to you. The reason the nurse got fired is because she is a liability not because of your honesty and she should have been fired. That clinic could have been reported to Medicaid fraud and fined a ridiculous amount of money or shut down. Any medical facility in the US that accepts Medicaid could be investigated by Medicaid for fraud even if the patient was not a Medicaid patient. If found liable for fraud, Medicaid can drop them as a provider. If that happens, Medicare automatically follows and Tricare (military insurance). That sends a red flag to private carriers who would likely follow suit; Urgent Care can't survive without insurance. The nurse could have been arrested and/or lost her license. So, in reality, you did her a huge favor.", "Sounds like a scam nta", "Share with your friends how the supervisor said they don't even accept cash and it was against their policy. I've literally never been charged anything at urgent care other than my $25/$50 copay. It honestly sounds like they were trying to scam you.\n\nSimilarily, the last 2 times I went to Lens Crafters they told me my insurance wasn't valid. I paid out of pocket the 1st time and then learned it was valid the whole time & refused to pay the 2nd time. Then they \"rechecked the insurance 3 more times\" and suddenly I didn't have to pay anything. I found out the insurance verifier kept inputting my information incorrectly.", "NTA. If she\u2019d asked you to pay by any method (been willing to take a card) I\u2019d think it was a simple mistake. Asking for cash only? That sounds like she was planning on keeping it. Honestly, in your position I\u2019d WANT her fired. She deserved it.", "If the clinic doesn't do cash payments there is zero chance this was a \"clerical error\". I bet you whatever you want you would have paid and still received the copay letter in the mail. And then had a great time trying to prove you paid cash because the paper trail would have been lost forever.\n\nNTA, for making a scene or for getting her fired with an honest review.", "Nta\u2026. How many other people has she swindled $500 from and then later they get billed she broke the hospital policy not you she got herself fired", "NTA\n\nAustralian here. You poor bugger. I'm so glad i live in australia. Just spent over a week in hospital and it's going to cost me nothing including 2 CT scans.", "NTA.\n\n$500 cash? To be seen at urgent care? Are they running an extortion operation?\n\nThis seems immoral and illegal. Good for you for not falling for it.\n\nI can't understand why your friends would think this is a clerical error. There is no scenario that would make this appropriate.", "You did NOT get that woman fired! Her behaviour and total lack of professionalism got her fired. Also it's messed up to expect a CASH payment to be seen when you're that sick, any decent healthcare professional would have seen to you because the money and bills can be sorted out at a later time. NTA. And don't think of it as her being fired, think of it as you preventing her from treating another sick person like trash.", "With all due respect to your friends who work in healthcare, they have no clue what they\u2019re talking about. The clinic said that it\u2019s not normal practice there and furthermore, it does not cost $500 to be seen at urgent care for a virus. I have paid out of pocket cash for urgent care visits out of network and even with a steroid shot and other treatments, it wasn\u2019t more than $200 upfront and nobody was trying to shake me down for it in bash when I was seriously ill. They tried to scam you and your friends are wrong and quite frankly being assholes to you.", "NTA if they don\u2019t do cash payments she was going to steal $500 from you and get away with it.", "My boss did it two days ago, emailed a customer back who had complained to let them know he fired the person involved.", "It did. That\u2019s the reason why I ended up having to stay at the ER overnight, and got admitted for a few days. I think that time peaked around 105 if they didn\u2019t constantly keep me full of acetaminophen\u2026.. I normally never go to the doctors for fevers. But I know anything above 103 is dangerous. And like I said, I\u2019m on immunosuppressants, and my sickness is tend to escalate quickly. That\u2019s the only reason I was willing to go to urgent care for a work note. Because I also wanted to get checked out.", ">employee confidentiality\n\nThis isn't a thing", "Stop.  The clinic doesn't take cash.  There was absolutely no reason to demand cash from you upfront.\n\nObviously the nurse was working against policy, at least, and being an outright scammer at the most.  Either way, she was a liability and let go.\n\nGoodness knows how many other people were shaken down during their time of need.  She and anyone else involved in her scheme could have raked in thousands of dollars.", "Also it\u2019s not the nurses job. Usually someone from billing deals with that. And idk a single clinic in America that will tell you they have to charge you first before they can see you. You were being scammed", "You didn't get them fired. They got themselves fired.", "Why, so she could rip off other ill and vulnerable patients who can't advocate for themselves like you did. That's pretty cowardly.", "So you'd rather this person try to scam someone else? Someone clearly in a vulnerable position if they're at urgent care?", "You didn\u2019t, she got herself fired for trying to be a thief. Plus why feel bad, on the balance of probabilities it likely isn\u2019t the first time the nurse has done or tried to do this.", "Not even for trying to *steal money from patients?*", "A medical worker, asking you to throw up money if you want to be cured, and doubling down by telling you, while you have a high fever, to go take $500 out of the ATM first... not only *deserves* to be fired, but should also have their license revoked", "She tried to rob you *whilst working on the job* of $500 and you think she shouldn't be fired....?"]}
