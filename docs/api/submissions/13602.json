Both me and my spouse have insurance. \n\nA couple of months ago, my spouse, and I both tested positive for a viral infection. His was relatively minor, but I am on multiple immune suppressants, and that always makes viral infections worse for me. I was running a fever of 103 and I had the worst chills, and body aches. My work demanded a sick note. The only place I could get into on short notice was my local urgent care.\n\nNow, my spouse had just gone to see them for a sick note not even two weeks prior for the same illness. They saw him, tested him, and sent him home with a note. We got a bill in the mail a few days later asking for his co-pay.\n\nAt first, they tried to send me back outside to wait, and told me it would be a three hour wait. But one of the nurses noticed how bad my fever was, and how sick I was, and she immediately took me into a back room.\n\nThis is where the problem occurred. Before they even could do more than take my temperature, another nurse came in and told me that they weren\u2019t affiliated with my insurance. The nurse looked me dead in the eye and told me it would be $500 cash to be seen. I mentioned that my spouse had been seen, and successfully billed, not even two weeks prior. The nurse was adamant and told me that unless I paid upfront, I was not going to be seen that day.\n\nHere\u2019s where I know I was a jerk. I threw an absolute fit. I was sick, in pain, and feverish, and just not in the mood for dealing with this. I kept insisting that they re-check the insurance. They refused. They kept insisting that I go outside to the ATM and take out $500 cash, and then they would bill me the rest if I wanted to pay out of pocket . I ended up having my husband escort me out of the clinic while I yelled a few choice words. We ended up going down to the local ER, who admitted me for a couple of days.\n\nA week later, I received a survey from the urgent care clinics office. I was honest with my review and told the story about them asking for cash. A few days later, a supervisor followed up and asked for me to elaborate on the story. He said that their clinic doesn\u2019t do cash payments, and said that what I told him the staff did was highly against their policies. A few weeks later, he called to let me know that that nurse had been let go, and the rest of the staff had been retrained/reprimanded.\n\nI recently relayed the story to a few friends who work in the medical field. They told me I was an absolute jerk who got a nurse fired over something as simple as a clerical error. They told me that insurance is change in the middle of the year all the time. She said I shouldn\u2019t have made a stink and I shouldn\u2019t have complained in the survey because I got that nurse fired. But I didn\u2019t ask for the survey, I didn\u2019t actively seek out the clinic supervisor. I merely responded to what they sent me, I\u2019ll be it was automated. I didn\u2019t want to get the nurse fired, I was just trying to be honest.\n\nWITA?", "created_utc": 1680211659, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/126ztfu/aita_for_making_a_stink_at_urgent_care_because/", "score": 163, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She was going to pocket that money, that's why she was so insistent you go get it. Glad you dodged the bullet!", "NTA. If the clinic legitimately needed an up-front payment from you for services, it could have been given in cash, debit card, or credit card - anything that debited that amount against you vs. the insurance company.

They do that when someone has clearly violated policies by taking advantage of sick people, and I doubt such a brazen attempt was the first time they\u2019d done it. You were probably just the first complaint they got that held enough weight to prove cause for termination.\n\nAll you did was attempt to get help when you were sick. Thankfully their survey to you outed this behaviour because preying on people when they are vulnerable or impaired is not congruent with who the majority of nurses are.

That seems so shady.  I think they were going to pocket your $500.     The fact it had to be cash is so sketchy.     Even if they wanted out of pocket funds you can pay by credit card.

You did the right thing and probably saved some old ladies from getting scammed!", "NTA\n\nIf you've told this story accurately, it definitely sounds like the individual who was fired was attempting to steal from you.\n\nI've never been in a clinical setting where I had to pre-pay. If they can't get your insurance to pay for it, they just bill you afterward. The fact that they were trying to get you to pre-pay (with cash no less) is the biggest red flag.\n\nThe other red flag is that a \"nurse\" approached you about payment. Nurses never deal with insurance--it's a completely different skillset. Any time you try to talk to a nurse about payment or cost of care, they will immediately defer to the billing office. So this lady either wasn't a nurse or if she was a nurse, she was straight up going rogue.", "NTA - you were stating the truth when asked. If there was unfairness it wasn't on your part .", "No you did not get the nurse fired for a clerical error. You got her fired for extortion. The clinic doesn\u2019t do cash payments so she 100% knew what she was doing was wrong. And since when does an urgent care visit cost $500? I would escalate this further and file a complaint with the licensing office in your state against her and against anyone else working in the office at that time. She shouldn\u2019t be allowed to do this again! NTA!", "It was not a clerical error.  That nurse was trying to scam people.  If they let her go, it was likely not just you.
