Dawn was in a difficult place when she met my brother. She was out of a marriage after struggling to have kids and was facing the fact she would never be a mother. My brother having four young children who lost their mother was an ideal thing for her and she said as much to me back in the day.\n\nLater they did have two children together.\n\nSo the relationship my four older nieces and nephews have with Dawn is very different. The oldest two are not super fond of her and do not look at her as their mother. But the middle two children do. All they know is Dawn as their mom and they adore her. They do not understand their older siblings prioritizing Jane's memory over Dawn. It has been argued over many times. Dawn is also legally the mom of the middle two now because she adopted them.\n\nThe oldest two are now older both in college while the middle and younger kids are still at home. The middle two kids have been on their older siblings cases a lot about treating Dawn like their mom because she's here and has been their mom longer than Jane was. The older two told them they don't care about Dawn. The middle two kids told them they'll be left out more over time if they keep it up and to remember how they often excluded themselves from stuff and how left out they must have felt. The older two told them they never felt left out in a negative way. They never wanted to be included in Mother's Day portraits with Dawn or to be part of her family traditions.\n\nLast week I had the middle kids. They told me they wanted to do something special for Dawn for Christmas and wanted the older two involved but they said no, and it turned into a fight between them with the middle kids texting the older ones constantly saying Dawn deserves better and why are they so upset at the idea of having two moms and loving both Jane and Dawn. I asked them about what their siblings normally say and they told me their siblings \"claim not to care\" but it's not possible. This is where the \"parental\" talk came in and I explained that their older siblings have different experiences to them and to believe them when they say they do not mind if they are left out.

The kids took it badly and said Dawn deserves better and how the older two upset her all the time when they act like she's not their mom too.

They are probably heartbroken over the way their mum is being airbrushed from history.", "NTA. This isn't really a parenting talk.  It is a reality check.  If they can't understand and change how they are reacting to the older two, why expect the older two to change?", "NTA. When you\u2019re dealing with a kid who\u2019s saying o doing something so wrong, it\u2019s not \u201cparenting\u201d to correct them. Especially if the actual parents won\u2019t do the parenting in the case at hand.", "It isn't 'parental' at all it's just good advise.. you're absolutely right and anyone who isn't stuck in the middle of it could have/should have told them the same thing by this point.", "NTA. You were there when the subject came up and you gave relevant input to the discussion. Hopefully it will stay with the two middle children so that they may eventually understand that each child experiences their childhood differently from the others and that is completely to be expected. You did not overstep anything. Special seeing as how the actual parent and stepmother have not succesfully managed to make the two middle children understand.", "NTA. If you had told the older two to participate and be more accepting of Dawn, the parents wouldn\u2019t have objected at all. They\u2019re only upset because you didn\u2019t say what they would\u2019ve wanted you to say.", "NTA, it sounds like the parents tried to weaponize those kids to get the older two to fall in line. \n\nWhat they are doing is risking the relationships between those children for their own agenda.", "\r  \nNTA, it sounds like you were trying to mediate and offer perspective, considering the complex family dynamics, even though it was misunderstood by your brother and SIL.", "Not the asshole. It's not a parental talk, you were just trying to help them understand their siblings. I feel like the parents should be doing better to try and explain this though.", "That wasn't \"parental\" at all, and rushing into a second marriage the way your brother did was bound to be confusing to kids that young, who hadn't really had a chance to process the loss of their mom. To ask them to just get over it and accept the new status quo shows a massive lack of empathy from their father and step mother. NTA, the best thing that family can do is back the fuck off.", "This is the third, maybe fourth, AITA post I\u2019ve read in two weeks about younger step kids bombarding their older siblings about treating/thinking of stepmom as real mom. It\u2019s getting *very* tired. \n\nBut giving the benefit of the doubt, NTA. Someone needed to stand up for the older kids and their parents obviously weren\u2019t going to stop the harassment.", "NTA. Was reality the \u2018line\u2019 you crossed?", "Also from some more of the family. My youngest sister and I are the two who have never pressured them about their relationship with Dawn or their dad.", "I am. My wife and youngest sister are too. We're doing our best to be the people the kids can speak to.", "Because the older two are \"wrong\" while the middle two kids are \"right\" and that's what it will always come down to ultimately.", "The parents are pretty much in agreement with the middle two. The relationship with the older two kids is very strained and there is not a whole lot of contact between them right now. The older kids call me and I call them a regularly and I'm aware of the fact they are okay with that distance. But the distance between them and the middle kids is growing with this.", "The rush put on finding another wife and mom for the kids created many problems. On top of everything else it made the older two feel more protective over the memory of their mom on top of all the confusion and unsettlement they would feel after that happened. Add to that you have a woman who found it a good thing for her that these four children had lost their mom and you have a recipe for disaster.", "That is so sad, I don't understand why the rest of your family would pressure those kids to forget their mom. Are they getting support from their mom's family?", "I'm so pleased to hear that. It sounds like they will always have a safe space with you which will be some comfort to them.", "If there dad can\u2019t see there side then just make sure they know you are there for them and that you understand why they feel the way they do.", "Jesus. The whole thing feels kind of sterile, like the 2 of them negotiated a contract rather than a marriage (yes, I know marriage is a contract, but this one feels extremely impersonal)\n\nThose kids never had a chance.", "I fully believe that this whole marriage was more of convenience and mutual want than actual interest in each other. Dawn wanted to be a mom and my brother wanted a wife for himself again and a mom for the kids.", "NTA.  Let's see.  Two of the kids brought an inter-sibling issue to their uncle.  They hoped that their uncle would take their side and persuade the other two siblings to do so as well.  Instead of taking their side, their uncle (you) offered them another perspective and said they should show some empathy for how the other siblings feel.  \n\nYou did **exactly** what you should do.  Your are an adult in their lives, and you provided a perspective they weren't getting.  IMO, the middle kids are almost certainly old enough to understand that adults sometimes disagree on things.   And given that (if I'm reading this right) they are teens, they are certainly old enough to examine different adults' perspectives and draw their own conclusions.  \n\nThis is an uncle's role.  And (quite frankly) I think on this issue, you gave them a perspective they needed to hear.", "NTA\n\nYou did good and you told them exactly what they needed to hear. Your brother and Dawn probably either got told an overinflated version by the kids to make sure they would have sided with them or they're just butthurt that in a couple minutes you made more to settle that conflict than what they did in their entire lives. \n\nGood job, that was just a good reality check that might contribute a lot to peace between those siblings.", "NTA but if they\u2019re two years away from college themselves and not able to understand this you\u2019re probably just wasting your breath.  The oldest two should just block their numbers, what little shits.", "NTA \n\nIf your brother had bothered to check in with his kids before launching into replacing Jane, this probably would be a non-issue or at least not a big of one as it is.\n\nThe middle two are old enough to understand that their older siblings have more memories of Jane and their relationship with her was different. Dawn was/is their fathers quickly found replacement that they didn't need or want at the time.\n\nDawn might be their mother, but she's not theirs. Someone had to tell them before the older kids completely blew up on them and truly hurt their feelings.\n\nBut the main fault lies imo, with your brother and Dawn. They should have done more to help them adjust because they acted in their best interests/wants, not what the kids, especially the older two needed which was time.", "NTA\n\nDawn is the only mom the middle two likely remember. The older may resent her for replacing their mom so soon after her death. They are teens & old enough to understand that other family members may not have the same dynamic with their stepmom that they do.", "Your brother is signing the death certificate on his relationship with his oldest kids. \n\nNTA. This was not a parental talk.", "NTA.   You were trying to help your niece/nephew see or from their older siblings perspective.   Your brother and SIL are wrong you didn't overstep.", "NTA. Here we have an example of people wanting a village but not accepting what comes with it. You as part of the village absolutely have the place to give advice! Good for you! Sounds like you handled the situation perfectly.", "NTA, sometimes people need an outside perspective and you were trying to give them that. You are right the older two don\u2019t feel excluded and are fine with their choices. The middle two need to let it go as they cannot tell others how they have to feel. They may in time come to appreciate Dawn\u2019s presence in their lives but they don\u2019t have to. Dawn needs to understand she married into a difficult situation. And the dad really needs to step up for everyone and allow everyone to have their own individual feelings.", "NTA. This aint a parental talk. Honestly it\u2019s one that\u2019s needed that neither your brother or Dawn could have been fussed to do considering how long this issue seemed to go on for. \n\nThe older children aren\u2019t wrong and frankly with how quickly their dad remarried it sounds like they weren\u2019t given enough time and support to grieve. If anything, I feel bad for them.", "This isn\u2019t a conversation that can only be relegated to parents, **as they\u2019ve failed so spectacularly over time to fix this.**\n\nThey are upset you said something, because they likely agree (where do you think the kids argument for forced connection comes from??).\n\nNTA - I would simply prioritize supporting my older niblings, and the them know they are seen/heard/loved and supported in their feelings.", "NTA, and I'm wondering how come their own father has never had that talk with them yet.", "NTA. The kids complained to you. You gave them a perfectly reasonable response. They didn\u2019t like it because the only response they wanted to hear was for you to agree with them. In the future, when the kids complain to you, tell them they burned a bridge by complaining about you to their parents.\n\nAlso, the elephant in this room is that the younger kids got this idea from your brother and SIL, who don\u2019t like it that they couldn\u2019t convince the older kids to erase their dead mother, and who consequently don\u2019t want you to say anything other than the party line.", "INFO: Solely out of curiousity, did your brother ever get his children therapy to deal with their loss and sudden change of having a stepmom? Or was just bringing home a new mommy his only \"solution\" at the death of their mother?", "NTA - Obviously it didn't go well, but you are family and they came to you with their issues. You were within your rights and within social norms to have that conversation.", "NTA. Dawn has to realize by now that they don't see her as their mother, so she should be over it. The middle two should quit nagging because it only leads towards resentment for all concerned.  Dawn is not their mother, facts are facts. If the two middle ones accept her as that, it's their prerogative, and the same applies to the older ones. Move on, you're beating a dead horse.\n\nYour brother probably brought this on himself by getting married so soon after. \n\nYour brother should have had that talk ages ago, and since he didn't, someone had to.", "NTA and I\u2019ll bet the middle kids haven\u2019t put this much pressure on the older kids all on their own.  It\u2019s shitty for Dawn & their dad to not respect the kids feelings, it was shitty of their dad to jump into a relationship so quickly and expect them to accept a replacement mom and it\u2019s shitty of them to put the middle kids in the middle of this mess.", "NTA. You did the correct thing. The older kids don't have to accept Dawn as their mother - she is not!!! The other two are being pests and should not be pressuring them.\n\nI have a feeling Dawn is manipulating behind the scene. Be a good aunt and allow the older kids to have their autonomy. They will likely go LC after they are adults and on their own.\n\nBTW - not impressed with your brother.", "NTA. I had several \u201cuncle talks\u201d that were formative for me, where my uncles could offer advice from an objective perspective, when my dad or other close family members were too close to a situation to see it objectively. This is the role of an uncle!", "NTA. At this point the middle kids are old enough to understand their older siblings point of view and are being deliberately obtuse, liked influenced by their parents\u2019 view of them being right. You\u2019ve done what you can. I would say continue to be available to all the kids and encourage the older to be available for a reconciliation when the middle ones finally get their heads out of their asses and apologize. Ideally it\u2019ll happen eventually.", "NTA. I don't see which part you did wrong. You just clarify the mistaken thoughts of them.", "NTA. Ask the 2 middle kids how would they feel if Dawn dies and his dad remarries within months and demands them to accept the new wife as their mom. Tell your brother to think about how his 2 older kids\u2019s feelings since he totally has been neglecting them.", "It sounds like your brother has 3 sets of kids. 2 of Janes kids, 2 of Dawns adopted kids and 2 of Dawns kids. \n\nThe middle 2 needed a reality check. You gave them that. \n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\nYour brother and Dawn have obviously pushed this narrative as long as the middle two can remember. They (the parents) are upset with you because you went against their story, that's it.\n\nIt's a terrible disservice to the middle two - your talk should have been one that your brother had with them years and years ago.\n\nJust to be clear, I don't really consider the kids AHs even though they're getting to the age where they should understand - they have obviously had this crammed down their throats basically forever. But your brother and his wife are AHs for doing this to their kids. They are the reason the older two are being alienated.", "NTA I really don't see this as a parental talk. This was a \"anyone but the parents\" talk.  What I mean is that,  in no way will the parents be able to objectively be able to talk about this.  Dawn effectively stole a dead woman's children with the support of their father.  The parents are the ah here.", "NTA The only reason you are getting flak from your brother and Dawn is that they are the source of this opinion in the first place...  the idea that the older two kids are 'wrong' did not originate with the middle two.\nWhat you said was not parenting...  it was truth.", "NTA", "I\u2019m between NTA and possibly NAH, but either way: you did exactly what I would have done. If your brother and Dawn consider this a \u2018parental\u2019 talk, it\u2019s a shame they never bothered to have it with the middle two.", "NTA.\n\nYou're right, and those kids \\*need\\* that perspective.  Their parents have failed them by not addressing this in a healthy way, and now it's fracturing the sibling units.", "you just said what any responsible adult would say to them. if the father and stepmother refuse to, someone has to do it for them. NTA", "NTA.\n\n>both said I stepped over the line from uncle to parent\n\nNo, you didn't. *They* involved *you* in their decision making, and you gave them your honest feedback.\n\n>it was not my place to have such a parental talk with the kids.\n\nSure, it's the parent's job. But if the oldest are now in college, it's been at least 12 years (or more) since this dynamic. Clearly, whatever they have done (if anything) over the last decade-plus has not worked.\n\nThe real AH here was your brother. I get that the thought of being a single parent to 4 young kids was daunting, but speeding into finding a \"replacement\" within mere months of Jane's passing was bound to do a number on his kids. This dynamic is direct consequence of that decision.", "NTA. It takes a village & all that. Also, you're not wrong. The middle two need to give some thought to what the older two went through. Their mom basically disappears & is very quickly replaced with another woman. I get it, but the way that will impact the rest of your life is different if it happens to you at 7 vs 2.", "NTA it wasn\u2019t a parental talk, it was a discussion between family members that sounds like it was needed. Your brother and his wife made this mess and unfortunately the kids are paying for their mistakes.", "NTA. Sometimes, you just have to stop trying to force a relationship.  If I were talking to your younger nieces and nephews, I would have told them that you can't control how people feel or how they act.  I would also tell them  ot to let this issue interfere in their relationships with their older siblings.", "NTA - The older siblings are basically being told to be a doormat, that their feelings don\u2019t matter and that they need to get in line so that the rest of the family\u2019s are validated and then everything will be fine.\n\nDon\u2019t waste your time on the younger ones but make it clear to the two older ones that you will always be there for them. That their feelings will always be validated by you and will never try to force them to feel or act someway just to please others.", "NTA.  You are teaching them to accept differences.  The only reason I can think of for the parents to be upset with your talk is that they might be using their two biological children to try and manipulate the two older ones.  Shame on them if they are.", "NTA. The older 2 are adults and are allowed to make their own choices and have their own perspective. I think the middle 2 just refuse to see that perspective and accept how their older siblings feel about Dawn", "NTA good lord how old are these kids now? They\u2019re like puppies refusing to let go.  They\u2019re the ones driving their siblings away.", "Nta. This talk was an everything and anyone discussion. The parents could have this discussion with them, their friends could talk to them about this, their extended family could. It just so happened to come from OP. He didn't overstep he was trying to get the kids to be open minded to the other POV in this situation. Sadly they have their minds made up and probably will never change them especially when the sole source of the issue already has an advance in the the way things play out on one side", "NTA, this does not sound parental at all\u2026 just perspective from a FAMILY member. The fact that your brother and SIL feel differently is ridiculous. They need to accept that the older two have the right to their feelings, opinions and beliefs. NO ONE can replace their mom\u2026 everyone needs to back off and just figure out the dynamics of their family while accepting everyone as they are!", "NTA - you were looking after them when the subject came up.\n\nBut I'm curious...why is this such a big deal after so  many years?  How often or how much is this mother/step-mother issue coming to the forefront?  A relationship should be allowed to form naturally, not forced into buckets of what to call it and how involved to be. \n\nAdvice to younger steps should be that everyone gets their relationship and don't force the family portraits/togetherness stuff.  You do you.", "NTA", "Wow, what a really good way to explain how they are feeling to your target audience. It\u2019s a shame that they didn\u2019t get it. I don\u2019t think you overstepped your bounds at all and hopefully they come around. NTA", "NTA but now that your brother and his wife have told you not to have this sort of conversation with the middles, it probably should be avoided. Please continue to offer your support to the oldest two though!", "What is the age of the middle age ones?", "Nope", "NTA. You should have a talk with Dawn and your brother about blended families while you are at it", "NTA.", "NTA - If the older 2 are in college these kids are almost grown.  It's okay to have real conversations with kiddos that are mostly grown as long as they are both truthful and kind.  You obviously love all the children.  Not to mention they INVITED your opinion, so then to go \"tell\" on you when they don't like it is just silly.  Good luck!", "Nta", "NTA \n\nYou didn\u2019t step into a parental role. You through some reality into their faces. And it\u2019s something that should have been thrown in the parents faces long ago. \n\nClearly Dawn and Daddy have brainwashed the kids into thinking that Dawn must be the one and only and they\u2019re hell bent on bringing the other two into the fold. What your brother and those now young adult teens need to know is if they don\u2019t cut it the fuck out, the older siblings may go no contact with all of them.", "NTA. I would guess that the older two have been forced/pressured to accept their father\u2019s relationship without any complaints since right after their mother\u2019s passing, that is bound to cause resentment. What you said was an accurate observation in a conversation brought up to you and based on your brother and Dawn\u2019s response, the older children\u2019s decision to distance themselves probably stems from having their situation and emotions belittled.", "NTA  \nYou didn't step over the line. This wasn't a parenting talk. This was simply trying to get two people to understand/respect that their sibs have had different experiences and don't share their feelings. \n\nHonestly, the 2 middle kids who are refusing to stop their crusade to get their way are the ones making things worse and pushing their older siblings away even farther.", "NTA\n\nIt wasn't really a 'parental talk' you spoke as a uncle defending your two eldest neice/ nephews boundries. The too youngest ones don't seem to grasp this as they probably don't remember their birth mother very well and are trying to push their own love for Dawn on to their two older siblings which will in reality have the opposite desired effect.\n\nI think the main reason your brother and Dawn are upset with you is because they both agree and and are actively egging on the two younger siblings to essentially harass the older ones, the claim of 'parental talk' here is just a weak excuse.\n\nYou sound like the only person to respect your older niece/nephews feelings and boundries and are there for them as a caring uncle, hats off to you \ud83d\udc4d\n\nIf Brother, Dawn and the younger sibling don't cut it out they may find the older ones going NC in the near future, theyre college age after all.", "NTA, because what you said was kind and respectful about everyone.\n\nSadly your brother and Dawn are being disrespectful of Jane's legacy and the older kids' decisions and emotions.\n\nIf parents are THAT toxic about dynamics I think you're allowed to say your opinion. I'm sick and tired to society pandering to fragile toxic parents' egos while not giving a crap of their childrens' suffering.\n\nAnd you now know who's REALLY the cause of the kids having a rift. Like many sibling problems, the parents are the ones really causing the dynamic and are refusing to be respectful of their two older kids' decisions.", "NTA- thank you for validating both sides. The memories of the older two with Jane are different than the younger two. My mom died when I was 8, but got sick when I was like 6.

He was so overwhelmed with trying to run the family, work, take care of the house etc, that he really didn't get to grieve his wife. He remarried less than a year after she passed & everyone judged him hard for that, but luckily he found someone who was willing to help him & the kids process their grief. The younger kids didn't remember their mom much, so she encouraged the older ones to tell them stories about her.

To lose that and experience deep grief and loss at that age is traumatic, and coupling that with the knowledge of all of the time and experiences you will never get with your parent is devastating and life altering. Having a parent die when you\u2019re a late teen is no less devastating, but you got more time with them and you are old enough to have a better idea of loss and death and you have more coping strategies. So yeah, those experiences are not the same, but if one situation is going to be harder than the other, I would say it would be much more difficult for a grieving young child who has had their world upended to have a \u201cnew mom\u201d forced into their life right away than for an older teen to adjust to their parent getting remarried when they\u2019re going going to move out and live on their own soon anyway.

But Dawn can\u2019t hide it or be dishonest. Even if they do nothing they have let the weight go even though they claim not to be bothered. It\u2019s not too late but I am thinking your brother and Dawn are a bit weak and unwilling to own mistakes. The older children should reach out to their siblings (the 2 middle siblings) when they want or when they graduate and share their truth. It doesn\u2019t have to dramatic but the truth may help.

Dawn and their father have obviously done a very, very poor job of keeping adult issues and problems contained to protect their kids\u2019 childhood experiences and sibling relationships. This may be due to ignorance and emotional immaturity on the parents\u2019 part, but it may also be somewhere on the spectrum of deliberate manipulation by Dawn and/or their father.
