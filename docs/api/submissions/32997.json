{"id": 32997, "submission_id": "18i6vad", "title": "AITA for having a \"parental\" talk with two of my brother's children which they took badly and offended my brother and SIL?", "selftext": "My brother has six kids. Four of them are from his first marriage to Jane. Jane passed away when their kids were 7, 6, 4 and 2. Within months of Jane's passing my brother married Dawn. There was no affair. My brother threw himself into finding another wife and mom for the kids right after Jane's funeral and Dawn was the second person he met who he considered. The first things went sour after two dates. Dawn was in a difficult place when she met my brother. She was out of a marriage after struggling to have kids and was facing the fact she would never be a mother. My brother having four young children who lost their mother was an ideal thing for her and she said as much to me back in the day.\n\nLater they did have two children together.\n\nSo the relationship my four older nieces and nephews have with Dawn is very different. The oldest two are not super fond of her and do not look at her as their mother. But the middle two children do. All they know is Dawn as their mom and they adore her. They do not understand their older siblings prioritizing Jane's memory over Dawn. It has been argued over many times. Dawn is also legally the mom of the middle two now because she adopted them.\n\nThe oldest two are now older both in college while the middle and younger kids are still at home. The middle two kids have been on their older siblings cases a lot about treating Dawn like their mom because she's here and has been their mom longer than Jane was. The older two told them they don't care about Dawn. The middle two kids told them they'll be left out more over time if they keep it up and to remember how they often excluded themselves from stuff and how left out they must have felt. The older two told them they never felt left out in a negative way. They never wanted to be included in Mother's Day portraits with Dawn or to be part of her family traditions.\n\nLast week I had the middle kids. They told me they wanted to do something special for Dawn for Christmas and wanted the older two involved but they said no, and it turned into a fight between them with the middle kids texting the older ones constantly saying Dawn deserves better and why are they so upset at the idea of having two moms and loving both Jane and Dawn. I asked them about what their siblings normally say and they told me their siblings \"claim not to care\" but it's not possible. This is where the \"parental\" talk came in and I explained that their older siblings have different experiences to them and to believe them when they say they do not mind if they are left out. I said I understand they love Dawn and feel like defending her but the older two probably feel the same about Jane. The kids took it badly and said Dawn deserves better and how the older two upset her all the time when they act like she's not their mom too. When they told my brother and Dawn, both said I stepped over the line from uncle to parent and it was not my place to have such a parental talk with the kids.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1702554282, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18i6vad/aita_for_having_a_parental_talk_with_two_of_my/", "score": 42, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

It's not like this just happened or the middle kids are so young they can't understand this. Your brother and Dawn should have had this talk years ago. \n\nThis is solid uncle advice, NTA.", "NTA - You spoke the truth. It doesn\u2019t sound like a deep parental talk - you highlighted what the middle siblings have been told repeatedly and refuse to hear. The older kids don\u2019t seem to have been incredibly rude or mean. If anything they\u2019re probably trying to deal with the fact they never got to fully grieve their mother before being presented with a new one and forced to accept it.", "NTA the truth of the matter is because your brother was so desperate to not be a single parent he tried to force his kids to accept dawn sooner that the older two were ready. Once they finish college and no longer financially need anything from there dad they will probably cut all\n6 of them out.", "NTA.  The oldest two need some support because it sounds like all they are getting is pressure from their dad, stepmom, and other siblings.", "NTA your brother and Dawn aren\u2019t going to be able to control the narrative for much longer. The younger kids will be begin forming opinions one way or another as they get older.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

They are probably heartbroken over the way their mum is being airbrushed from history.", "NTA. This isn't really a parenting talk.  It is a reality check.  If they can't understand and change how they are reacting to the older two, why expect the older two to change?", "NTA. When you\u2019re dealing with a kid who\u2019s saying o doing something so wrong, it\u2019s not \u201cparenting\u201d to correct them. Especially if the actual parents won\u2019t do the parenting in the case at hand.", "It isn't 'parental' at all it's just good advise.. you're absolutely right and anyone who isn't stuck in the middle of it could have/should have told them the same thing by this point.", "NTA. You were there when the subject came up and you gave relevant input to the discussion. Hopefully it will stay with the two middle children so that they may eventually understand that each child experiences their childhood differently from the others and that is completely to be expected. You did not overstep anything. Special seeing as how the actual parent and stepmother have not succesfully managed to make the two middle children understand.", "NTA. If you had told the older two to participate and be more accepting of Dawn, the parents wouldn\u2019t have objected at all. They\u2019re only upset because you didn\u2019t say what they would\u2019ve wanted you to say.", "NTA, it sounds like the parents tried to weaponize those kids to get the older two to fall in line. \n\nWhat they are doing is risking the relationships between those children for their own agenda.", "\r  \nNTA, it sounds like you were trying to mediate and offer perspective, considering the complex family dynamics, even though it was misunderstood by your brother and SIL.", "Not the asshole. It's not a parental talk, you were just trying to help them understand their siblings. I feel like the parents should be doing better to try and explain this though.", "That wasn't \"parental\" at all, and rushing into a second marriage the way your brother did was bound to be confusing to kids that young, who hadn't really had a chance to process the loss of their mom. To ask them to just get over it and accept the new status quo shows a massive lack of empathy from their father and step mother. NTA, the best thing that family can do is back the fuck off.", "This is the third, maybe fourth, AITA post I\u2019ve read in two weeks about younger step kids bombarding their older siblings about treating/thinking of stepmom as real mom. It\u2019s getting *very* tired. \n\nBut giving the benefit of the doubt, NTA. Someone needed to stand up for the older kids and their parents obviously weren\u2019t going to stop the harassment.", "NTA. Was reality the \u2018line\u2019 you crossed?", "Also from some more of the family. My youngest sister and I are the two who have never pressured them about their relationship with Dawn or their dad.", "I am. My wife and youngest sister are too. We're doing our best to be the people the kids can speak to.", "Because the older two are \"wrong\" while the middle two kids are \"right\" and that's what it will always come down to ultimately.", "The parents are pretty much in agreement with the middle two. The relationship with the older two kids is very strained and there is not a whole lot of contact between them right now. The older kids call me and I call them a regularly and I'm aware of the fact they are okay with that distance. But the distance between them and the middle kids is growing with this.", "The rush put on finding another wife and mom for the kids created many problems. On top of everything else it made the older two feel more protective over the memory of their mom on top of all the confusion and unsettlement they would feel after that happened. Add to that you have a woman who found it a good thing for her that these four children had lost their mom and you have a recipe for disaster.", "That is so sad, I don't understand why the rest of your family would pressure those kids to forget their mom. Are they getting support from their mom's family?", "I'm so pleased to hear that. It sounds like they will always have a safe space with you which will be some comfort to them.", "If there dad can\u2019t see there side then just make sure they know you are there for them and that you understand why they feel the way they do.", "Jesus. The whole thing feels kind of sterile, like the 2 of them negotiated a contract rather than a marriage (yes, I know marriage is a contract, but this one feels extremely impersonal)\n\nThose kids never had a chance.", "I fully believe that this whole marriage was more of convenience and mutual want than actual interest in each other. Dawn wanted to be a mom and my brother wanted a wife for himself again and a mom for the kids."]}
