Firmly don\u2019t approve and am sorry to hear you have to put up with it.\n\nHowever, you need to be careful and look into tenancy law in you locality because evictions can be a tricky business.

However, you've admitted in the comments you haven't spoken to him about it. It seems unfair to kick someone out of their housing when they haven't been given a chance to change their behavior. \n\nAs a landlord, your relationship is a business one - while he's certainly not treating it like that, you would still be better off setting a professional tone and asking him to cut the shit. Especially since he thinks these are funny jokes, he hasn't really been an *asshole* yet since he doesn't know you don't like these comments - someone might say it should be obvious, but it seems that isn't to him. With no opportunity to redeem himself while his housing is at stake, I'd say you would be the asshole.", "NTA.\n\nI would go ahead and cancel the lease.

The only saving grace is that he\u2019s never made any of his comments in front of my two boys (as they\u2019re only 8 and 11).

However as Brits (which we both are) do occasionally have slightly strange sense of humour so I\u2019ve kind of ignored them up until the talk of the sexual health clinic.

We always make sure that the rent is fair.  Our last two tenants (both ladies) were lovely.  We live in a very small island where there are strange rules about who can own and live in properties.  As I was born here I can own a house more easily.  Others can only rent for at least the first 5 years or living on the island.  Hence why we rent our space room out.", "Always remember \u201cthe  look\u201d doesn\u2019t  always work on everyone some ppl can\u2019t read body language well or take social ques, verbally stating things is always the way, you absolutely should give him the chance to stop once you use your words because you saying nothing he potentially thinks you find it funny, or he is genuinely a creeper\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f but until you actually speak up you won\u2019t know", "My comment was going to be similar to the above. Yes, sometimes people ARE that cluesless\u2014 heck, I knew someone who made comments like this and only I knew they were virgins but they thought their comments made them cool or funny. Not saying that this is the class, but having a conversation and saying to him, hey this is not cool, sexual talk like that makes me uncomfortable and it is at the inappropriate time, will probably might be all it takes. It is ok to give people benefit of the doubt, but it is also ok to tell people when what they are doing is wrong.

Besides, I would never put someone out on the street.  I would give him notice as per the tenancy agreement and would help him find something else if need be."]}
