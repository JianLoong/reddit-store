I get it's scary when you're home alone with the dude, but you need to at least let him know that this behavior will cause him to be evicted or for the lease to be terminated once it's set to be renewed.\n\nBut absolutely not, no, NTA, this dude is crossing too many lines. I would just make sure there's at least some documentation, such as a recorded phone call, conversation, letter, or email, so he can't say that you evicted him for no reason or that he wasn't given any feedback on his behavior, both to protect yourself, but also because he might not realize that he was being inappropriate.", "NTA. It\u2019a harassment. Cancel the lease before things take a bad turn.", "ESH. You shouldn't have to tolerate harassment, but also landleeching is unethical. Rent is theft.", "Yes not even worth having a \u201ctalk\u201d with someone who has this little self awareness.", "No, this guy is aware of how inappropriate his comments are. He's able to refrain, somehow, from talking about STDs and sex toys when there are kids around. Talking about these topics is a choice.\n\nIf you want to be \"fair\", tell him verbally ONCE. Then cancel his lease if it ever happens again.\n\nGuys who act like this give off serious predator vibes. He either already knows this (and thus enjoys your unease), or should learn it ASAP.\n\nNTA.", "Definitely say something, and you could have your husband with you if you're uncomfortable! If his comments aren't directed at your own sexuality and he does this equally to your husband, it's likely he's socially oblivious and raunchy, rather than a threat to you. He may well be very embarrassed to realize he's been misreading the situation and shut up from now on.\n\nThat said, it's not your job to teach him how to act, and if you wanted to terminate his lease with a note about his behavior, you're well within your rights to do so.", "Genuinely shit ppl who sexually harassed ppl know to zip it around kids on stuff like that too, again a conversation isn\u2019t that hard", "Bad idea.\n\n\"I had been renting this apartment and this person evicted me with no warning, and no reason, even though I did everything according to the lease!\" And you loose the suit because you never gave a reason for eviction when you could literally just have a conversation about it, and then if he hurts you you also have evidence of a grudge.\n\nIt will always be a better idea to get the evidence of a conversation, and maybe he'll stop if he realizes it was coming off wrong.", "An inability to read social cues doesn't make someone a \"broken man,\" and using your words to communicate your discomfort is hardly what any rational person would call rehabilitation. If no one ever tells someone why they don't want them around, how are they supposed to magically figure it out? If you can't read facial expressions or tone due to an inherent limitation, no amount of ostracism will cause you to be able to do so. What a bizarre and unfair expectation.", "And that\u2019s where ppl go wrong because they know what they are thinking and think \u201cthe look\u201d somehow translates, ppl aren\u2019t mind readers, use words and vocalise like an adult", "Tenancy laws are generally relaxed when the tenant is leasing a portion of the landlord's personal home.", "Yeah, sure, but here's the thing, she's also putting herself in danger by not at least telling him to cut it the fuck out. \n\nSure, she can evict him, but if she doesn't AT LEAST have a conversation and a record of having it, she could get sued for wrongful eviction, he could make excuses to keep coming back, etc. \n\nShe needs to have this conversation, tell him to stop, tell him that if he doesn't he will be evicted, and then follow through, but just evicting him and not at least warning him about the eviction and the reason is a bad idea. It not only sets her up for legal backlash, it also makes a perverted man very angry, and an angry perverted man with no evidence of a grudge is much more dangerous and harder to catch than an angry perverted man with a grudge and evidence.", "True, but unless OP tells him it's inappropriate, or he makes a direct threat, no judge would take those comments, without a negative reaction on OP's part, as grounds for an eviction.", "IMO, this is a moral responsibility on her part, even if it\u2019s not a legal one.", "NTA but you better check the legality of what you have to do.", "NTA. He needs to go. You don't need someone like that around you and your kids. The sooner he goes, the better.", "NTA He knows he\u2019s being inappropriate. And if he claims he didn\u2019t know, he has more issues than you want to deal with! Get him out!", "NTA, Tell your husband of the matter first. Then nake the tenant explicitly aware that you don't want him speaking to you like that. Tell him you're not comfortable with him speaking to you like this(or speaking to you at all). He conveniently does when your husband is not around, so be careful. Try to record or have any and every evidence you can grab. Maybe that will also help legally to end his lease on your terms if needed.\nBecause you've been told your husband before, he'll have no luck trying to pin that on you. And if he does any (over)smart move, your husband will have your side on the lease agreement.", "No but depending on where you live you might have a fight on your hands if you have a written contract. In America, you have to give a 30 day eviction and if they don't get out you then have to take them to court and have them removed, which can take another 60 days...not sure where you live but removing someone that doesn't leave willingly can be a lengthy process. You're totally justified in your thoughts of removing this filth from your personal space. I do think you should tell your husband your thoughts on the issue and have him address it to the tenant personally. NTA", "I'm going to say NTA.\n\nHowever, before you terminate his lease, sit down and have a discussion with him about his unwanted behavior. Make sure you inform him that, if his behavior and inappropriate comments continues, then you will kick him out. He may not realize that he is making you uncomfortable.  If, after that, he continues making those kinds of statements to you, then terminate his lease. You do not have to put up with that kind of thing in your own home.", "Do it with your husband so you're both on the same page. United front as it were. It'll also give you a bit of back up.", "Get ride of him immediately. Report and record the comments he makes. I would be worried that he would take it too far one day.", "Maybe don\u2019t ride him. But definitely get rid of him. \n\n\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Definitely don't go in with a black light, just hire someone to decontaminate!", "They aren't asking OP to rehab this person, just to talk to the guy before they throw him out. That's all. If he still does it she can throw him out. The guy makes the same comments to the husband.", "Nah, if someone makes uncomfortable sexual comments in your own home, especially a home with children, they need to go."]}
