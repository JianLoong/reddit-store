He makes about $100k a year, I make about $90k. We purchased the house for $575k (with a 5.79 interest rate, yikes) but put $225 down (he did $100k, I did $125k).

Because we're married, the other person is entitled to that money should one of us die, but there is an option to sign a waiver allowing them to give it to somebody else. I obviously want that money to go to him to help with the massive mortgage we currently have. \n\nLast week, he asked me to sign a waiver that would allow him to give his 401(k) to his parents instead.

I just meant we have our own bank accounts for \"extras\" (like I use mine for birthday gifts for him, trips to Starbucks, nights out with the girls). Other than that though, we do have combined finances. We split the mortgage 50/50 (although he's paying more to catch up to me right now). Everything else comes out of the combined account too (car insurance, phone bills, travel expenses, Christmas gifts for family).

You have a massive mortgage. It would be irresponsible of him to remove you as the beneficiary of his 401k before that mortgage is cleared.\n\nI would counter and tell him that if the mortgage is clear and the house is owned outright in 7 years then you can revisit the issue, but until then no, because should something happen to him you shouldn\u2019t be entirely responsible for the costs of a home you mutually agreed to buy and his parents have the equity in their own home and would have his life insurance too.\n\nOr you can tell him that you have had a rethink and you will also leave your 401k to someone else and if you predecease your husband he can struggle to pay the mortgage.", "So what happens if the 2 of you have an accident together & he happens to die but you're injured & need years of recovery time?\n\nHe's assuming he'd be gone but life for you is exactly the same.

You have a giant joint liability that would need to be paid if he died.", "Question: Why do his parents know about his finances? It's none of their business. Personally, I think the parents are the gold diggers here.\n\nOtherwise, you are NTA for wanting to have what would be legally yours in the case of your husband's death, though it's his money and he gets to choose who he wants to have inherit it.

Something doesn't sound right. \n\nAlso, his parents need to stfu because as his spouse, you are entitled to this money. They are not. They sound like they are hunting for cash.", "NTA. I find it bizarre that he would get his family involved in something that should between the two of you. He actually told his parents on you! And damaged your relationship with them. That doesn't sound like he's thinking long term to me. What husband wants his parents to dislike his wife? The parent's reaction is bad news also. The prospect of Money seems to be more important to them than the health of their son's marriage. They've contentiously labeled you a gold digger. How do you put that insult back in the bottle? \n\nAlso, your finances aren't really separate if you purchased a home together.

This is a private matter in your marriage, and it's none of their business. Go ahead and subtract any of their input from the discussion, and ask yourself if you're ok with future issues being a group project. Ultimately, this is his decision to make; it would be ideal if you agreed on a plan, but not completely necessary. It is absolutely vital that you agree on how to approach disagreement with respect.", "NTA.

Given how they're behaving, tho, not sure why you would want to.", "Is he want you to waive your rights tell him waive his rights fair is only fair", "NTA", "NTA but I think there's a lot more to this story that you haven't divulged or you may not even know about.\n\nHe's only 35.  His parents will most likely die before he does.  He hasn't put as much into the house as you have.  His life insurance is to his parents.  He wants you to forfeit any money to his parents as well, who are currently secure financially.  There's more to this.  A lot more.   (Not even touching telling his parents about this.  That's just...  ugh.)\n\nI'm a suspicious person by nature and all of this would probably prompt me to hire a forensic accountant.  Do not sign that waiver.", "NTA. Especially since THEY will be getting the life insurance and you'll be responsible for paying off his funeral and any mandated expenses from his estate, and you'll still be responsible for the house. I'd be very upset in your shoes.", "So he's cool with you signing yours over to someone else as well then?", "INFO - What about your 401(k), is he willing to sign a waiver? Or does he expect that to go to him if something happens?", "Anyone's future is unknown. Your husband should know that. The surviving spouse (believe me, I know this) has enough to handle with soul-crushing grief and should not have to worry about money issues. Your high mortgage home is not paid off and you are both currently trying to over-pay your mortgage, which is a smart move on both your parts. To tell his parents that he wants to leave them his 401K and the fact that they have the gall to confront you over this is a huge red flag. They have a secure future with a home that is paid off and he wants to leave you in a vulnerable position so they can have extra? That doesn't make sense emotionally or financially. I would seriously consider marriage counseling as the only thing this makes me think is he has bigger issues than where his 401K goes should he die prematurely.", "NTA. In the event he did die, it\u2019s quite possible it would come after hefty and burdensome medical expenses. Presumably, he\u2019d expect you, not his parents, to help pay for those expenses. So you could be left with extremely diminished finances and none of the security of a 401k or life insurance. And then there are the possible situations where you become disabled, can\u2019t work, and therefore can\u2019t pay the mortgage. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t understand his mindset here. You\u2019d think he\u2019d want his surviving spouse to have a financial safety net and not risk losing housing. Is it possible he\u2019s lying about his parents\u2019 financial security? Because that\u2019s the only scenario where I could see an argument in his favor.", "NTA", "NTA.    So, if he died tomorrow, can you afford the mortgage on your own?\nIt would be a foolish decision to sign the waiver. \nThis is none if his parents business", "NTA - but your husband is a HUGE one.  He is supposed to cherish you - not his parents.  Honor your mother and father, but cleave to your wife.  He has issues and you need to address them before you have kids (unless that already happened).", "Someone in comments described the house as a liability and I think that is a good way to look at it.  Is the mortgage fully insured and is there a possibility of hardship regarding the house for a surviving spouse?  If the answer is yes, refinancing may be necessary at some point, maybe the answer is additional life insurance.  You can pay for the insurance, to be assured it is in place, and reduce your joint financial contributions accordingly.  You pay for it, the in-laws don\u2019t have any claim on that policy.  If you discontinue or continue the policy after the mortgage is paid, your choice.  Then you would feel secure in signing off on the 401K.  It is a little bit petty but if you sign off on his 401k, he should be signing off on yours.  After that it is your choice to leave it to him or not.  So the sauce for the goose is the same as the gander.  I generally think you can over insure and it seems redundant when there is already life insurance in place but it is a different approach. \nNote: I have made the assumption that you have a house title that assures your husband\u2019s rights pass to you.", "NTA..you, as his wife are his next of kin. I don\u2019t understand why he wants the money to go to his parents, even his life insurance should go to you (in my opinion) you are married\u2026.with all my worldly goods I thee endow! You will still have to live and pay the mortgage if he should pass away.

I know that the one I pay for for my parents is about $13/month for $100,000 coverage (my husband is the beneficiary on my main one). \n\nThere. Problem solved for the cost of a few cups of coffee and you\u2019re NTA.", "So if your husband dies, there\u2019s no life insurance and if he has his way, no money from the 401k? Jesus. Is he aware anything can happen? You can get sick, disabled, laid off? Your job and decent salary aren\u2019t guaranteed at all. Marriage is a partnership. Your husband needs to get on board with that.", "NAH- Is this really about the financial security of the house or the emotional aspect of your husband not leaving you this money? He's giving both to his parents, and not providing for you at all. Which is valid because of the financial separation you have in your relationship, but it probably doesn't feel very good. \n\nAlso, what happens if he dies in a wreck and you're in it too, and the medical debt costs you your 401k and the house? Are you on good terms with his parents and they'd help you if you needed it? I'm guessing not if they're upset about this situation instead of insisting you stay the beneficiary. \n\nIt's his money, but it is still weird that he would want you to be on your own after he's gone.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Talk to a financial advisor. Life insurance is to help you pay off the house if something were to happen to him. His 401k is to help you retire. Retirement is an \u201cus\u201d thing, not a you vs me thing. Your retirement accounts are supposed to be there when both of you are no longer able/willing to work. If something were to happen to him, you would have significantly less ability to save for your retirement. You should remain the beneficiary. You also need to talk to him about Life insurance, especially if kids are involved. His parents aren\u2019t responsible for taking care of the house/ family finances.

I would add that with this signing over, if the parents die before collecting on the 401k or the life insurance, the proceeds will go to their estate, not to OP - unless husband designates her as a secondary beneficiary.

If husband wants to cover his parents in case he and OP get hit by a bus together, perhaps he could designate them as secondary beneficiaries?\n\nWhat troubles me here is husband prioritizing the parents' financial security over his wife's, even though they are equal partners in setting up their life together.

Those joint decisions mean that without the other person, your lives would look very different. When you both are retired, you each are counting on the other to continue to pay their 50%. If that 50% were gone, it would drastically impact the remaining spouse's retirement outlook.\n\nYou are absolutely correct that you should not waive your rights to his 401k. You are counting on his 50%. He is counting on *your* 50% as well.\n\nThere is a matter of scale that he isn't considering. It's kind of like how it's not much more expensive to cook for two compared to cooking for one. You still need all of the pots and pans and condiments to cook for one, so it is ultimately more expensive to cook for one person, even if you cook the same amount of food cooking separately as when you cook together.\n\nThat might not be the best example, but the idea is that if you were planning on only your income and abilities, you might make different decisions since the expenses and upkeep would not be shared with anyone. If your husband passes away, you will be stuck with paying for decisions based on both of your income and abilities. That will really make a difference in retirement.\n\nAlso, each of you should have life insurance taken out to benefit the other, for some amount no less than the remaining mortgage, and preferably a great deal more. \n\nIf he is so concerned about his parents, then he could simply increase the amount of life insurance for them.
