He makes about $100k a year, I make about $90k. We purchased the house for $575k (with a 5.79 interest rate, yikes) but put $225 down (he did $100k, I did $125k).

Because we're married, the other person is entitled to that money should one of us die, but there is an option to sign a waiver allowing them to give it to somebody else. I obviously want that money to go to him to help with the massive mortgage we currently have. \n\nLast week, he asked me to sign a waiver that would allow him to give his 401(k) to his parents instead.

I just meant we have our own bank accounts for \"extras\" (like I use mine for birthday gifts for him, trips to Starbucks, nights out with the girls). Other than that though, we do have combined finances. We split the mortgage 50/50 (although he's paying more to catch up to me right now). Everything else comes out of the combined account too (car insurance, phone bills, travel expenses, Christmas gifts for family).

You have a massive mortgage. It would be irresponsible of him to remove you as the beneficiary of his 401k before that mortgage is cleared.\n\nI would counter and tell him that if the mortgage is clear and the house is owned outright in 7 years then you can revisit the issue, but until then no, because should something happen to him you shouldn\u2019t be entirely responsible for the costs of a home you mutually agreed to buy and his parents have the equity in their own home and would have his life insurance too.\n\nOr you can tell him that you have had a rethink and you will also leave your 401k to someone else and if you predecease your husband he can struggle to pay the mortgage.", "So what happens if the 2 of you have an accident together & he happens to die but you're injured & need years of recovery time?\n\nHe's assuming he'd be gone but life for you is exactly the same.

You have a giant joint liability that would need to be paid if he died.", "Question: Why do his parents know about his finances? It's none of their business. Personally, I think the parents are the gold diggers here.\n\nOtherwise, you are NTA for wanting to have what would be legally yours in the case of your husband's death, though it's his money and he gets to choose who he wants to have inherit it.

Something doesn't sound right. \n\nAlso, his parents need to stfu because as his spouse, you are entitled to this money. They are not. They sound like they are hunting for cash.", "NTA. I find it bizarre that he would get his family involved in something that should between the two of you. He actually told his parents on you! And damaged your relationship with them. That doesn't sound like he's thinking long term to me. What husband wants his parents to dislike his wife? The parent's reaction is bad news also. The prospect of Money seems to be more important to them than the health of their son's marriage. They've contentiously labeled you a gold digger. How do you put that insult back in the bottle? \n\nAlso, your finances aren't really separate if you purchased a home together.

This is a private matter in your marriage, and it's none of their business. Go ahead and subtract any of their input from the discussion, and ask yourself if you're ok with future issues being a group project.

His parents will most likely die before he does.  He hasn't put as much into the house as you have.  His life insurance is to his parents.  He wants you to forfeit any money to his parents as well, who are currently secure financially.  There's more to this.  A lot more.   (Not even touching telling his parents about this.  That's just...  ugh.)\n\nI'm a suspicious person by nature and all of this would probably prompt me to hire a forensic accountant.  Do not sign that waiver.", "NTA. Especially since THEY will be getting the life insurance and you'll be responsible for paying off his funeral and any mandated expenses from his estate, and you'll still be responsible for the house. I'd be very upset in your shoes.", "So he's cool with you signing yours over to someone else as well then?", "INFO - What about your 401(k), is he willing to sign a waiver? Or does he expect that to go to him if something happens?", "Anyone's future is unknown. Your husband should know that. The surviving spouse (believe me, I know this) has enough to handle with soul-crushing grief and should not have to worry about money issues. Your high mortgage home is not paid off and you are both currently trying to over-pay your mortgage, which is a smart move on both your parts. To tell his parents that he wants to leave them his 401K and the fact that they have the gall to confront you over this is a huge red flag. They have a secure future with a home that is paid off and he wants to leave you in a vulnerable position so they can have extra? That doesn't make sense emotionally or financially. I would seriously consider marriage counseling as the only thing this makes me think is he has bigger issues than where his 401K goes should he die prematurely.", "NTA. In the event he did die, it\u2019s quite possible it would come after hefty and burdensome medical expenses. Presumably, he\u2019d expect you, not his parents, to help pay for those expenses. So you could be left with extremely diminished finances and none of the security of a 401k or life insurance. And then there are the possible situations where you become disabled, can\u2019t work, and therefore can\u2019t pay the mortgage. \n\nHonestly, I don\u2019t understand his mindset here. You\u2019d think he\u2019d want his surviving spouse to have a financial safety net and not risk losing housing. Is it possible he\u2019s lying about his parents\u2019 financial security? Because that\u2019s the only scenario where I could see an argument in his favor.", "NTA", "NTA.    So, if he died tomorrow, can you afford the mortgage on your own?\nIt would be a foolish decision to sign the waiver. \nThis is none if his parents business", "NTA - but your husband is a HUGE one.  He is supposed to cherish you - not his parents.  Honor your mother and father, but cleave to your wife.  He has issues and you need to address them before you have kids (unless that already happened).", "Someone in comments described the house as a liability and I think that is a good way to look at it.  Is the mortgage fully insured and is there a possibility of hardship regarding the house for a surviving spouse?  If the answer is yes, refinancing may be necessary at some point, maybe the answer is additional life insurance.  You can pay for the insurance, to be assured it is in place, and reduce your joint financial contributions accordingly.  You pay for it, the in-laws don\u2019t have any claim on that policy.  If you discontinue or continue the policy after the mortgage is paid, your choice.  Then you would feel secure in signing off on the 401K.  It is a little bit petty but if you sign off on his 401k, he should be signing off on yours.  After that it is your choice to leave it to him or not.  So the sauce for the goose is the same as the gander.  I generally think you can over insure and it seems redundant when there is already life insurance in place but it is a different approach. \nNote: I have made the assumption that you have a house title that assures your husband\u2019s rights pass to you.", "NTA..you, as his wife are his next of kin. I don\u2019t understand why he wants the money to go to his parents, even his life insurance should go to you (in my opinion) you are married\u2026.with all my worldly goods I thee endow! You will still have to live and pay the mortgage if he should pass away.

I know that the one I pay for for my parents is about $13/month for $100,000 coverage (my husband is the beneficiary on my main one). \n\nThere. Problem solved for the cost of a few cups of coffee and you\u2019re NTA.", "So if your husband dies, there\u2019s no life insurance and if he has his way, no money from the 401k? Jesus. Is he aware anything can happen? You can get sick, disabled, laid off? Your job and decent salary aren\u2019t guaranteed at all. Marriage is a partnership. Your husband needs to get on board with that.", "NAH- Is this really about the financial security of the house or the emotional aspect of your husband not leaving you this money? He's giving both to his parents, and not providing for you at all. Which is valid because of the financial separation you have in your relationship, but it probably doesn't feel very good. \n\nAlso, what happens if he dies in a wreck and you're in it too, and the medical debt costs you your 401k and the house? Are you on good terms with his parents and they'd help you if you needed it? I'm guessing not if they're upset about this situation instead of insisting you stay the beneficiary. \n\nIt's his money, but it is still weird that he would want you to be on your own after he's gone.", "[deleted]", "NTA. Talk to a financial advisor. Life insurance is to help you pay off the house if something were to happen to him. His 401k is to help you retire. Retirement is an \u201cus\u201d thing, not a you vs me thing. Your retirement accounts are supposed to be there when both of you are no longer able/willing to work. If something were to happen to him, you would have significantly less ability to save for your retirement. You should remain the beneficiary. You also need to talk to him about Life insurance, especially if kids are involved. His parents aren\u2019t responsible for taking care of the house/ family finances.

I am wondering about your husband\u2019s intentions here, is your marriage rocky ? It seems like he is preparing for a divorce. Between the life insurance and 401K, your husband genuinely does not seem to care about you.", "If he wants his savings to go to someone else, he should first give you the chance to pad your own savings to compensate. IMO this would mean repaying you the $125k down payment, and making future mortgage payments on his own, while you put the money into your own investment accounts. If he suddenly can\u2019t afford that, how does he expect you to do it while making $10k less?", "NTA. You bought this home on the assumption you\u2019d pay it off together. It\u2019s not reasonable to expect you to shoulder that burden alone.\n\nBut you could also go for life insurance to help you out if you become a widow. \n\nI wonder why your husband is worried about his parents\u2019 right now?", "1.  where is it you got a mortgage without a term life policy payable to the bank. That seems standard practice. \n2. Either your together for the long haul or not, but why would money govto his parents, is he supporting the. , doesnt sound like it, something seems off. \n3. Are you planning on building a family, if so , you shoild be tje one to recieve the payout, until any kids you havd reach majority, then estate planning should figure out the distributions. \n\nEither way. Traditionally inheritance goes down not up", "NTA. It\u2019s weird to me however. I work in the hospital and know as we age we receive hospital bills and if a person is legally married and marked wife or husband. If one of you passed away you are responsible for the debt occurred from all hospitalizations for your spouse. Also what if you have children? my husband and I have life insurance and 401k and both make very good money but I would never leave stuff to my parents over my spouse. Only in the event we both die at the same time and even then once our baby is here (currently pregnant) we plan to change all beneficiaries to baby boy.", "Or is planning to fake his own death and live off the money going to his parents.", "\"My husband's parents now think I'm an asshole and a gold digger\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSays the people that are trying to screw you over in favour of themselves?  Jesus,  pot... kettle\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNTA", "Uh, y'all know he can designate a % of the 401k to different people, right? Super easy. Calculate how much of it you would need to cover 50% of the mortgage, and leave the rest to his parents. He can update it annually or not. Idk why y'all are being so black and white on the issue. You definitely need to work on your communication.", "Info:if you are a gold digger what does that make them? Are you in their will? Will you and your husband both inherit their estate or just him?. This honestly sounds crazy that your husband wants to leave you without a penny from him should something happen to him. They already have his life insurance which tbh given that yous own a home together is weird enough but I honestly wouldn't be signing that form ever! If anything happens to him you do not know what your situation will be. They are covered they have each other and their sons life insurance. Protect yourself, he is your HUSBAND! You now come before his parents.", "NTA. You have no idea what could happen in the next 7 years that could change your ability to pay the mortgage \nEven without the mortgage this is a strange thing to ask.", "NTA I'm not a great believer in money going up the chain rather than down it. But what if there was a car crash that killed him, but left you injured and unable to work? Who would pay the mortgage then? I think you need to say that you will give your 401 to one of your family members then instead of him. That might make him realise what he is asking of you, when the boot is on the other foot. Certainly go see a financial adviser who will help make sure you have a good financial future. My husband's pension goes to me, as does his life insurance policy as he wants to make sure im taken care of. We have a plan already in place should he pass before the mortgage is paid, which doesn't leave me in a difficult situation. Your husband is married to you, not his parents.", "NTA. So he cares more about his already set and established parents than you his wife?  Wow, real winner you got there.", "NTA. Is your husband willling to have a life insurance policy in your name until the mortgage is paid off?", "It seems that you are married to him and he is married to his parents. I hope you don't have kids with him because he looks like someone who would screw you over tomorrow without any hesitation. Unfortunately, when it comes to finances, you will always have to rely on yourself. If you sign a waiver, ask him to sign it for you as well. He needs a taste of his own medicine. A loving and caring partner would never put their spouse in this situation.", "I'm confused.  Why would his parents need the money and not you as his wife?  You said their home is paid off and they are well off enough with their own money and I presume retirement.  Are you planning on having kids ever?  What happens if you do and he doesnt change the 401k back to you to take care of your kids?  And even if you don't want kids (which is fine obv) you are his wife.  You are building a life together.  You aren't his life insurance beneficiary but seriously consider what happens if he passes. Mortgage or not, aren't you going to be the one to plan his funeral?  And idk about you but if my husband passes, I'd be devastated for quite some time.  I don't know how what would happen to me.  Pick up and go back to work the day after the funeral?  Probably not.  \nIf his parents are that concerned about HIS money, what does that make them?  Mooches?", "NTA, and his parents are also AH for not understanding why you would want his 401K. Wife > parents, his parents have each other", "Another option is he could buy mortgage insurance if he's that insistent on this path, it would pay off the mortgage and his parents would get his 401(k) money. I would make him pay for the insurance since he is making the ask.", "His parents made him do it.", "NTA:  this seems like it should be part of a larger conversation. Why would his parents be so concerned about their sons estate plan?  Is it possible *he\u2019s* their retirement plan?  And if so, how do you feel about that? \n\nWhen you got married, you explicitly promised to take care of each other forever. It sounds like your husband may have made this promise to his parents as well, and if so you need to get on the same page.\n\nBtw:  his 401k is legally yours if he passes away. You can\u2019t be a gold digger over something that\u2019s already yours.", "He\u2019s put less into the house, has less savings, earns more money and puts his parents before his partner. NTA, he certainly is though.", "Why did he even get married if he wants her to sign away all of the legal rights derived from the marriage contract? This sounds like the tip of the iceberg. OP is NTA and needs to talk to an estate lawyer, get mortgage insurance, and not sign away her rights.", "Someone mentioned maybe he\u2019s planning on divorcing her and wants to protect that asset.", "This is incorrect. Federal law mandates 401(k)s and other pension plans always go to the spouse unless they waive that right. \n\nIf you've name beneficiaries and then get married, the marriage overrides those previously named beneficiaries.", "Except she clearly stated that he has his life insurance policy set to go to his parents should anything happen to him... Therefore she would not get it", "He is also leaving his life insurance to his parents.", "What an ignorant and quite repugnant comment.\n\nYour ill-informed comment makes you look foolish"]}
