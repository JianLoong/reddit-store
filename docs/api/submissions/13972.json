One child. \nI\u2019ve always been big on doing nice things for my husbands birthday. One year was 1000 dollar golf clubs, a mini surprise party, decorate the house with 200 balloons, big expensive steak dinners. I use to have to save a lot to do it, but seeing him happy like that was worth it.\n\nFast forward to my birthday last year: I was one month postpartum. I had an emergency C-section and was recovering. I had brought up causally for my birthday i would of liked something of my daughter, either a card or her birthstone. A card with her little handprint would of been cute. \nHe looked at me and said, don\u2019t expect a thing this year I have no money.\nI was shocked because - he infact has money and just spent 2000 on a bachelor party. But - again, I wasn\u2019t expecting much.\nI didn\u2019t make a big deal. My family however, we\u2019re pissed. My sister had asked him to spilt something with her for me and he said no. No explanation just no. So she came over with family and decorated the house for me.\nIn the end, because he saw how upset my family was for how he was acting towards me( more than just birthday stuff) he gave me a gift card he knowing I couldn\u2019t use.. whatever.\n\nAnyway fast forward to now. A lot more tension between us. He again, told me not to expect Mother\u2019s Day gifts/ that he has to pay his credit card and I just nodded my head. BUT That\u2019s when he\u2019s said so what are we doing for my birthday???? I was shocked but instinctively said \u201c don\u2019t expect anything I have no money\u201d\nHe looked at me like I crushed his soul and was like wow really. I\u2019m like I\u2019m on mat leave where would I have money for you? Now, he\u2019s stomping his feet saying that \u201cI do nothing for him\u201d\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1680612300, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12bi187/aita_not_doing_anything_for_husbands_birthday/", "score": 27, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Couldn\u2019t even get you a bday card after you gave birth. Your own family tells you he is a jerk. You\u2019re a YTA to yourself if you stay and put up with his immature, selfish ways. You want your kid to have someone to look up to and he is not a role model. Seriously, go live your family who actually care about you.", "NTA - Why are you married to this man? He has no respect for you.", "NTA.  You can get a card for like a dollar.  Fingerpaints to do a handprint in that card are not expensive.\n\nSo he should know if you all are so broke that he can't spend five dollars on you, then it would be irresponsible of you to spend $1000 on him.  \n\nIts fascinating that some people seem shocked and hurt when their own behavior gets reciprocated back at them.  Seems a little narcissistic maybe?", "NTA. Your husband is a major AH. He seems, self-centered, selfish, and frankly treating you very badly. I question whether he has any redeeming qualities because he sounds like a spoiled brat. \n\nI hope for your sake, he does have some redeeming qualities does reading your post. One wonders what the attraction is for you?", "OP, I hope your finances are separate. Has it always been this way?", "NTA. He waited until your family got annoyed and shamed him for doing nothing until deciding to get you a last-minute present. Especially considering the effort you\u2019ve gone to for him previously. He seems to think these grand gestures are a a one-way thing.", "NTA.\n\nI'm glad you said you're not doing anything for his birthday because I would've done the same thing. All you're doing is matching his energy.", "NTA\n\nThis man is acting like a child. And not at all showing up as a partner for you.\n\nIs this what he\u2019s always been like? Or has something changed - you might need to sit down together and figure out what\u2019s happening", "Leave", "NTA this marriage is over.  \n\nThey is clearly nothing here.  \n\nHe is super selfish and self absorbed.", "Nta. I'm sorry you're going through that. It sounds very one-sided. When people show you who they are, believe them. Don't go all out on his gifts anymore. Instead, put that money towards your birthday and celebrate you! Buy yourself a nice steak dinner, vacation with friends, spa weekend or a shopping spree! He clearly has shown his priorities which is himself. Maybe you should take a page out of his book and give him that same treatment.", "NTA\n\nSo right after telling you not to expect gifts for Mother's Day, he wanted to know what he was getting for his birthday? \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f He's cheap, not very smart, acts like a kid... Is he insanely handsome? Other than that, I don't see why someone would want to marry such a gem? As a birthday gift, you can put in a nice envelope the useless gift card he gave you. \ud83d\ude0f \n\nAnyway you may want to have a plan B, in case things get worse after that day. Do you have a place to stay with your baby?", "NTA, nobody deserves to get nothing on their bday. I don\u2019t care how hard things are, you always get your partner something. Doesn\u2019t have to be expensive. He set a precedent with the way he acted, though.", "NTA. Where do you see this relationship going?\n\nINFO: How was he before your kid?", "NTA. This guy is a narcissist, full stop.", "NTA how difficult could it possibly be to get a card with an infant's handprint? He couldn't do the bare minimum for you and continues to not be able to do the bare minimum for you but expects you to continue going over the top for him. He needs a reality check.", "NTA. Partnerships aren't competitions. They shouldn't be leaches either. \n\nCongrats on the kid and I hope the two of you are happy together.", "NTA. I\u2019m so glad you stood up for yourself. Let him whine like the child he is.", "NTA, but if this isn\u2019t a radical change for him, consider your long term options.", "NTA so there's no money to put a baby hand print on a nit of card but he expects you to get him a birthday surprise? You weren't asking alot", "NTA. Situations like this always make me wonder what story the obviously wrong person is telling themselves about what\u2019s happening. How do they justify such blatant unfairness?", "Ohhh, he looked like you *crushed his soul*. The poor darling. (s)\n\nNTA and I am so sorry you are living with this.\n\nAbout the Mothers Day thing, he told you not to expect anything\u2026 Years ago I heard that just after Mothers Day is when, (if they have thought about it), women are more likely to set out to find an affair partner.\n\nI\u2019m not suggesting you cheat. But you might think about getting out. NTA if you did.", "NTA. he got \"too comfortable\" with you. Time to show him to never take things for granted.", "ESH - how do you both not know if the other is having money troubles? Try talking to each other.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
