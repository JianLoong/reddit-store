No explanation just no. So she came over with family and decorated the house for me.\nIn the end, because he saw how upset my family was for how he was acting towards me( more than just birthday stuff) he gave me a gift card he knowing I couldn\u2019t use.. whatever.\n\nAnyway fast forward to now.

I had to sell my things sometimes just to have money. \n\nBelieve it or not, an MLM is what got me away from him. I don\u2019t do it anymore but in two months I had a couple grand and I got my own apartment and moved out.", "NTA\n\nYou now see his true colors. He doesn\u2019t respect you or consider you a priority.", "my narc ex only bought me 2 presents in our three year relationship - $200 shoes one of the times i caught him cheating, and for one of my birthdays a laptop cover & case in my favorite color. it was $20 and didn\u2019t even fit my laptop. said he\u2019d return it and get me something else, he never did. he never had money bc he couldn\u2019t keep a job, i told him i\u2019d be just as happy with a handwritten note or a card. i never received either. \n\ni was the one spending hundreds of dollars on holidays and his birthdays. it killed me. i felt so unloved and under appreciated.\n\nNTA OP. get out for you & your kid. you both deserve better.", "Sentimental reasons ( \"he'll start to care like he did back in the day!\") and/or sink cost since she was with him nearly 20 years before marriage. \n\nThe men never change.", "She's been with him for fifteen years! Has he been like this all the while? The mind boggles.", "You know the saying \"you can't help someone until they want to help themselves\"? It's a similar thing for people leaving abusive relationships\u2014which this relationship absolutely is. \n\nI'm pretty sure OP has reached a point where she knows her relationship is fucked up, and this realization has been a long time coming. I'm sure people in her life have been telling her this for a long time too. \n\nBut being in an abusive relationship is like being in a reality distortion field. Mentally disengaging from all the fucked up shit that's been normalized is often process. Asking the internet is basically OP's way of getting external confirmation for what she knows in her heart to be true. Hopefully this will be the extra push she needs to take the next steps to leave him.", "Oh lord :( I wonder if people just settle for whatever shit sandwich they get at some point because they don't have hope of finding a better alternative or don't think they deserve anything better?", "Sometimes it\u2019s just so hard to see past the abuse\u2026.it took me 20 years of marriage to get out\u202620 years before I got healthy enough to take care of myself and stop caring for him while he took more and more from me\u2026you just sometimes can\u2019t see the storm when you\u2019re in it", "Saw your comment below OP and it all makes a bit more sense now.", "Good riddance.  Ugh", "She deleted her post history now..", "It seems she\u2019s deleted her post history, what happened?  I\u2019m so invested in her story and (hopefully) upcoming freedom and success \ud83d\ude2d", "People do that when they're getting a lot of the same advice. In this case, \"leave him.\" She will probably be back, hopefully with a good update.", "Stephen King described it as being asleep in someone else's madness. \n\nThis internet stranger is very proud of you. It took my mom 20 years too. I have seen a life like yours firsthand, and you have done the impossible.", "Sounds like your blaming victim...", "My father quit being a nurse in a med/surg unit and became a delivery driver for Dominos.
