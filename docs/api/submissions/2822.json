However, you need to now temper your feelings about it - it doesn't effect you in any way, he has permanently marked his body which may effect his future relationships, and made you live inside his head rent free whilst you live your own life.\n\nYou should try to laugh at how absolutely pathetic this is - live your best life and never speak to him again.", "YTA because what possible difference does it make in your life if anyone has \\*your\\* name tattooed on their body. You actually gave him exactly what he was looking for -  your making a scene and showing that he still has power over you.\n\nI mean the reality is that he is the idiot for tattooing your name on his body.

He's the one who will have to explain to his next partner why he has another girl's name tattooed on him. Make like Elsa and Let It Go.", "Nta that is WEIRD behavior on his part. People hate when there's a reaction to an action \ud83d\ude44 but if you weren't supposed to get mad he shouldn't have put your name permanently on his body AFTER the breakup. That's genuinely so weird.", "NTA. I would be pissed too! He is likely doing it to retain some sort of connection to you, so the best response you could give is to completely ignore him and his tattoo moving forward.", "YTA - unless you have a trademark on your particular name you have no say so in this whatsoever.", "ESH.

His body, you making a big deal out of it probably gave him satisfaction, unless your name is zaboomafooogle, other people out there have that name.  It\u2019s just a name.

What do you will think happen then?", "Esh\n\nWas it petty and weird for him to get it, no doubt. \n\nYelling at him and demanding he remove it weren't right route.

Is it kind of pathetic if the reason for the breakup is that he caved to pressure and strange for him to then get a permanent reminder of you. But it\u2019s his body and as such, your confrontation was pretty unhinged. Let it go and until you can behave differently, don\u2019t interact with him.", "ESH. He\u2019s weird for getting the tattoo but you cannot control what other people do with their bodies.", "YTA. \n\nIt's his body. You were making a scene over something you can't change.", "NTA, but I will say it\u2019s not worth the effort of yelling at him. He wants to make you angry and get under your skin, best thing to do is to just try and ignore it. I assume you don\u2019t see him everyday or anything like that and that the tattoo isn\u2019t visible, so just act like it doesn\u2019t bother you!", "His body, his choice.

That\u2019s really odd and a bit creepy. It\u2019s his body, so you can\u2019t really tell him to remove it although I understand why would want him to. I get the feeling he did so to try annoy you  and cause a scene which worked. \nPersonally I think you just need to stop associating with these people so you don\u2019t have to deal with him.", "YTA. Is what he did weird? Definitely. It doesn't make any sense at all. Does that give you the right to yell and scream at him in a public place for a choice that he made that will only affect him? No. Had you not done that, everything would have been fine, but now you look like the crazy one here.", "INFO: Was the relationship unhealthy? Was he abusive, a total asshole, or get off on provoking you? \n\nIf the answer is yes, your over-the-top reaction makes sense. If not, ESH.", "[removed]", "NTA It sounds like it would be healthier for you to try to move away again. The tattoo wasn't in memory of you, its a a notch on a bed post, its a claim of ownership so I can understand how it makes you feel. But it is useless to engage with him as you cannot stop him getting tattoos or asking him to remove them. Stop texting, stop engaging, that is how he gets off by interactions with you. The only power you have is to block his number, ignore him in public and aim to move away.", "YTA. There was no need to react to a tattoo like that. It will not affect you. It might affect him. Why are you so pissed about it? Why did you have to make that kind of scene? I think there is more to your reaction than you are letting on.\n\nI would have just laughed my ass off.", "YTA. Look, you just want to move on. I get it. But he can put your name on his body if he wants. It's stupid. His next gf will hate it. But it's his choice.\n\nDisengage from this guy. If you need new friends, go find some. Whatever you need to do to let this anger go.
