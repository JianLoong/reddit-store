If you live with your parents, \"safe\" would mean the smallest safe deposit box at your bank, unless you have lockable places in your lockable bedroom.\n\nIn the future there is no need for either parent to hold money on your behalf, nor is there any need for them to use your money to pay for anything at all. If you get grant or scholarship money, it should now go into your account. There should be a damn good reason for your dad, rather than you, to pay any bills you owe.  Keep your money out of his hands, and prepare for a fight and bad feeling about it.\n\nIf you owe your parents or anyone else, never pay them in cash. Pay your parents or any other creditor in a way that is trackable and provable. You might talk about this with the bank official who opens your new account. Also discuss credit cards, and check out Consumer Reports annual report on the best credit card to have.\n\nThe reason you should control your birth certificate and SS cards is because they prove that you were born, and your SS number can be misused by some one, such as a parent, taking out a loan or insurance policy in your name. You need your BC to get a passport.\n\nI recommend Consumer Reports because it has been around nearly a century and is owned by an independent foundation, and advises consumers about the best of lots of things---just about anything you buy.

NTA", "NTA put future paychecks in a different account and only put money that's intended to share in his account.\n\nIt sounds like your parents may be having some financial troubles and you may want to prepare yourself in case they can't keep paying your tuition. It isn't just about the bills they needed to pay, the lying and defensiveness when you asked is a huge red flag that they're trying to cover up money problems.", "OP, please get a separate bank account and be watchful of your purse/wallet around your dad. this could turn into something bad, like financial abuse or him trying to stop you from moving out. however, he is your dad so i would recommend a sit down with him and mom and calmly explain to them why u are hurt and why it was wrong (emphasis on CALMLY)", "It's appalling (and was a bright red flag) that you couldn't even LOOK at \" your\" bank account. Your parents infantilized you. Many parents sit down with their grade schoolers to explain this stuff, especially if the child has a bank account. You've been deliberately kept in the dark YEARS past the time when it was remotely appropriate.", "If your summer job is paying the mortgage I would be really worried about their ability to keep paying your tuition.", "But now you need that money and they apparently led you to believe it was safe with them. Nobody is going to protect you but you here. If you just wave your hand and say Well, if they needed it to pay bills....that was not the agreement you thought you had. If you are to work, instead of being at University, because they need your money, you are 100% entitled to know what that money was spent on, and what spending your work will be supporting in the future.\n\nThis is your future we're talking about.  Incidentally, if you're going to be paying their bills, you should have a contract with your parents defining the amount you will pay them and what it's for, and how long you are expected to support this. Again, when you open your new bank account, ask the bank official to recommend a lawyer for you, because you simply don't have the experience to navigate this yourself. Your dad is holding all the cards here and, once again, you are the only protector you have.", "NTA, you are an adult, you are happy for them to use the money, but you have the right to know where it is and how much you have left (if some), he proved to be dishonest about this topic before, so it's more than reasonable to not trust his word alone.", "NTA.\n\nIt's time to move your money into an account your father doesn't have access to. That's financial abuse op. He doesn't have the right to use your money without your permission, consent or knowledge. That's theft op. You're not your father's atm.\n\nMove your money and start putting it into an account he doesn't have his name on or access to. Keep your card on you at all time and never give him access to your financials. \n\nIf you let things continue the way you are, you're going to be working with nothing to show for it, not even savings. Stop trusting your parents to manage it for you, and manage it yourself. You might find you actually have cash I'd you keep your father's greedy hands off it.", "NTA. Get a new bank account and don't give your parents access to it. Transfer all your money into the new account and notify your employer that you have a new account for direct deposit. Your father did not put that money in a savings account, that's why he started screaming at you.", "Oh, ok, I think the post wasn't clear enough", "It is normal in Spain, for example, they paid for your stuff all their life, it's normal here to consider money as the family money when people is living together.", "Ok that\u2019s something new for me to learn today. Thank you. I\u2019m thinking though that if OP was Spanish and this is what was happening they wouldn\u2019t be asking here.", "info: if your parents need your wages to pay basic expenses like the mortgage, how are they going to continue paying your tuition?", "Get your own account and start managing your own finances.", "NTA, think about getting your own account it would be fine if he'd just said money is tight. Can I use this to pay some house bills, but just taking and lying is horrible.", "Since your parents are paying for your schooling, maybe he used some of the money there. NTA. Your Dad acted Sketchy when you asked about your money, but I think you should write off the money you lost and put the money you make this summer in a new account that only you have access to.  Don't make a big deal about it. Don't talk about it unless asked. Especially if they are paying more for your education than you are.  It's not worth the fall out. Just put this summer's earnings in a new account.", ">i dont care, my money is their money and theyre paying for my university tuition. its the least i can do. also im working full time this summer again so i can still earn money\n\nExcept that your money ISN\u2019T their money. It\u2019s great that they\u2019re supporting you by paying tuition, and now that you\u2019re 19 they could even potentially charge you rent. But the catch is, they need to discuss this with you, and you need to agree who is responsible for what, and for how much. The problem isn\u2019t the payment or transfer, it\u2019s that they did it without your permission. \n\nYou worked for it, and it\u2019s your money. You should be the one to agree to and then pay your parents for reasonable expenses. They can\u2019t just dip into your account themselves. Time to set up your own independent account. NTA.", "NTA. get your own account and dont let him use it anymore. Clearly he is not being responsible with your money. Do you think maybe he spent it so you cant move out?", "This is stealing even if you knew some of it was going towards bills, he didn't tell you how much and clearly you weren't expecting so much to be taken, therefore he stole from you. Change banks now. Get your money out of that account and the \"savings\" account - though you might not be able to - if he withdrew it into an account you don't have access to then that was a deliberate move. If he got some of the money back and was \"saving\" it to give back to you, he would have put it in the account you already have access to and not one where you don't.", "i wish he at least told me once he started making the payments. then i would have arranged other means of earning money because i needed this to move out. i thought i had the majority of what i earned saved, but hes been using it to pay bills since my pay started coming in. i just wanted information, thats what my \"problem\" is."]}
