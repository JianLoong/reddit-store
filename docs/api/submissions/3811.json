Probably the money is gone and you should get your own bank account soon.  You have a good attitude about it, I doubt a lot of people would", "NTA, if you pay into expenses, then you can see the books.", "NTA even for a second. Get another account that only you can control and if you really feel like you 'owe' your parents money for bills you can give them the amount you are comfortable with. What your dad's done, from taking the money you've earned, to not telling you where it is, to yelling at you, is entirely out of line. 100% no maybes about it.", "NTA. At the end of the day, it\u2019s your money that you worked hard to earn. He shouldn\u2019t have touched it or taken it without talking to you first. Asshole move on his part.", "Why at 19 would your parents have access to your bank accounts. .\n\nSo the reality is your father stole your money and is trying to gaslight you Into thinking you are doing something wrong. I get you say you don't mind, but really I'd that were the case you wouldn't be asking for it, or you would have told them to keep it. By the way your parents aren't paying for your education, it seems you are, with the money you earned. It's your money, you earned it and now you can't have the space you wanted because he took it. \n\nIf your parents couldn't have afforded your schooling without stealing your money, they should have told you up front so you could make arrangements.. your father is a thief, I would press charges personally.", "NTA- unfortunately his outsized reaction tells you everything. He has used the money and obviously can't show you.  I would say- I'm trying to make plans and budgets and I need to know what I'm starting with, I don't understand what the problem is in me asking that and why you won't tell me.", "NTA but you need to open a new account WITHOUT giving him access and move whats left of your money over to it now. No your money is not your money and your father shouldn't be paying bills and other things with your money when he has his OWN income.  Short of him paying you back you're never seeing that money again because its gone. You do need to care OP because this is financial abuse. And yes he did steal your money. Doesn't matter that he still had access to the account that should ended the second you turned 18.\n\nDoesn't even matter at this point what he spent the money on, but Im gonna strongly assume its something he didn't want your mother knowing about it the payments were coming from their personal account.", "NTA, get your own bank account that they don\u2019t have access to!!", "NTA your dad either is trying to control you or he is using it for his own purposes. You worked for it, you have a right to know where it went.  \n\nStart a new account your dad has no access to. It's going to happen again.", "You're NTA. Your dad was so defensive, even he knows he had done something wrong.", "NTA. Your dad's reaction was suspicious. Using your account would be a great way to hide something from your mom. I don't just mean an affair, could be anything.", "NTA, but your dad sure is. You have every right to know where your money is. But your dad shouldn\u2019t have lied to you about it\u2019s safe-keeping if he knew he spent it on bills.", "I guess NTA, it was YOUR money afterall... but confused why your dad has access to your bank account?\n\nBest option going forward to avoid conflict is open a new account and have your pay go there... and just treat the previous money as if its gone... you didn't give any numbers, so I'm hoping/assuming its not a really high amount, and the money they pay for your tuition is more than what you had in the account?", "NTA.\n\nYou say you found out that he was paying bills, but you also said that he said it\u2019s in a savings account. Do you know what the actual situation is? Was he embarrassed that he took money from you so he lied and said it was in savings?", "NTA. Get a new bank account, and get your direct deposit money deposited to it. An account that your parents don\u2019t have access to. If you want to help with bills, pay them. Or, ask how much you should be giving your parents sort of like rent each month. But the fact that they can\u2019t tell you where your money went\u2026 Major red flag. If your dad doesn\u2019t want to share with you the details of all the bills, then he doesn\u2019t also get to take however much money he deems acceptable. If the roles were different, and you were a married couple, This would be financial abuse.", "INFO: Why does your dad have access to your money? And why is your money their money?", "NTA Why would he not tell you where it was? Maybe he feels shame that he used it, and hoped he would be able to replace it before it became an issue.\n\nYou did nothing wrong. Let things cool down and then say \"Dad if you had to use my savings to pay bills, I am ok with that. I just want to know if it is gone, so that I can plan accordingly\".\n\nGet  your own bank account, maybe you can start saving again. It is great that you aren't angry and hostile to your dad. If you have a separate account, he can ask you for money if it is needed, and you will at least have a choice, and know where it is going.", "NTA. You're an adult and you should have your money in your own account without anyone else having access to it. If they ask you to pay rent or you choose to contribute a certain amount, that's on you - transfer the money at will, don't just give them full access to your money.", "NTA, you are an adult who is working and makes your own money.  Not you aren\u2019t wrong for asking where the money you had in your account went, and asking for a better answer than \u201cIt\u2019s safe, somewhere.\u201d  I wouldn\u2019t even give my nine year old a mealy mouthed answer like that, much less yell at them for asking me where their things are.\n\nSo is this an account his or your mother\u2019s name is also on?  If so, new account preferably in a new bank.  If not then by taking money out of the account what he did is provable theft, it\u2019s theft either way but for some reason when it\u2019s a joint account it\u2019s harder to prove.  In any case it was wrong of him, and I would secure any future funds away from him, and if he wants you to pay rent then that\u2019s a different conversation.", "NTA. Get your own account. Don\u2019t give them access.", "NTA. Dad stole from you. He doesn't just get to take your money without asking, it doesn't matter if he pays your tuition, etc, it was your check. If he needed you to start chipping in on expenses he needed to talk to you about it!\n\nYou're 19, get your own bank account ASAP. Consider a bank that your parents do not use. Do not allow your parents to have access to it and keep all account numbers and debit cards where they cannot find them.", "NTA, even if you don't mind that it has gone on bills it's your right to know where it's gone because it's money you've earned.\n\nWould your parents be able to manage the bills on their own if you moved out? I ask because you mention at the end that you're worried you might not be able to afford that now so have you considered the possibility that this is a way to stop that?", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

It's your money, and honestly I wouldn't be as blase as you are about it - it's one thing to decide you'll pay for some bills and such because you're living under their roof/they're paying for college, but it's another thing entirely for them to just take your own earned money without even a conversation OR your knowledge. \n\nYour father is being very much an AH, just for doing that and then for evading questions, AND for then screaming at you when you (quite rightfully) press the matter.\n\nSwitch to an account that they can't access, please!

You are in a tricky situation because you still live in his house and can't afford to move out.  Does he still have the debit card?  You need to get your money into an account that he can't access.\n\nThe ways he talked to you seems really dismissive and condescending.  Has he always been like this to you?  How was your relationship up until this?  What about your mom?  What does she think?", "You did not accuse him, you asked where it was ?  He did steal the money, when you take someone else's money without asking it's STEALING !  Don't hold your breath waiting for him to repay it ?  Stealing from family is pretty damm low ethics !", "NTA \n\nYou are an adult and in control of your own money. Open up a separate bank account they don\u2019t have access to. Deposit all money there.", "NTA Get your own account that he can't touch immediately", "NTA You are 19 so you should've set up your own bank account that only you can access at 18 if you're from the US.  You have rights as an adult and your father needs to show you where your money is when you ask.  If he keeps being aggressive you will need to follow up with your local police, if your father refuses you.  Where does your money get deposited into?\n\nRight now the first thing you need to do is set up an independent account and change where your job gets paid into.

It's rightfully yours, not his.", "NTA, and that's theft.\n\nYou should get your money and put it into your own account.

I get that you gave your father permission to use your money to pay bills but the fact that he isn't willing to tell you exactly where the $ went is pretty sketchy. Not saying he is doing anything illegal, maybe he is just embarrassed about having to take money from you or he is not financially responsible.\n\nI would open a bank account in my name only, place the balance left in here and make sure any future direct deposits are made to this account.\n\nThis doesn't mean you can't still help out with bills in the future. Just tell your father to hand you the bills and you will pay them directly-it is good experience for when you get your own place.", "NTA. OP, get a bank account he doesn't have access to and withdraw the money, and put it into a new account with a different bank.

The bank can remove money from your savings account if and when your father overdraws the checking account. \n\nThis is good advice but set yourself up a checking account at an entirely different bank, don't mention it to your father and begin squirreling money away in the new account.

Then like was said before you can pay them whatever you want, but you really need to have control over your own finances.", "Ok. That doesn't change much, tbh. I mean, he has not been straight with you about how much money he took or where he's put it or why. It might be just that he was embarrassed having to use his kid's money. This is Reddit so someone's gonna suggest he's using it to gamble or fund a scientific expedition to hunt for Mole People or something equally terrible. The fact remains that you cannot account for the money you earned because he didn't tell you about using it for his needs. And then he flipped out at you for asking him about it.  \n\n\n If he needs you to contribute then he should talk to you about it. If he wanted to set up a savings account for you he should have talked to you about it. Those are reasonable expectations to have. You can't plan for your future when you don't know how much money you have or will have.", "He flipped out because he was caught and panicked. NTA", "Open your own account.", "Maybe he reacted that way because it hurts his pride to need to use money from his daughter. Dad's can be like that. You did nothing wrong.", "Did he maybe get laid off, is struggling financially, and is embarrassed to share with the family? Is his behavior/reaction typical or unusual? Agree with the first poster that the reaction seems suspicious", "I hope you\u2019ve already called the bank to change that.", "If he took more than they put into tuition without some kind of agreement regarding rent/expenses/etc., he essentially stole your money.\n\nYou need to get a separate account now.  And you absolutely have a right to know what your money is being spent on.  If you are contributing to the household budget, you have a right to look at the books.", "Gotcha... well, yeah, sounds like something shady happened, but how big a stink do you want to make about it? are they charging you rent?\n\nIt sucks that your money's gone, but probably best to move on, and get that new account for yourself ASAP...\n\nGood luck with school!", "But if you were saving up to move out why did you give him permission to use your money to pay bills? At the very least you should have set limits on the amount of money he could use.", "i never gave him permission, he never asked. i didnt even have access to my account.", "How do you not have access to your own account? If your name is on the account, you can use the $.\n\nIf your name is not on the account, then don't put your money in it anymore. Get your own account so that only you control your money. That way if your father needs money, you decide whether or not to give it to him and you control how much is used. That way you have money for your needs.", "its a joint account and i couldnt log in anywhere as i didnt know the password. i should have known better but i chose not to speak up about opening my own account because i trusted him", "Of course you trusted him, he's your father. I can tell just from your responses here that you love him. Unfortunately, sometimes the people we love the most let us down.  \n\nSadly, this is a life lesson. Once you open your own account, you can contact the bank with the joint account and have them remove your name from the account or close it.\n\nI hope that once you are back at school you can get a part time job or maybe a paid internship and start saving again.\n\nGood luck."]}
