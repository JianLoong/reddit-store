Mom sounds like a narcissistic AH. Please know her behaviour is *NOT* your fault, ever. I speak from bitter experience... Hugs!", "NTA mom sounds a little unhinged\n\nIn our house, we joke that I should get a present because I did the hard work, the kid just had to show up. But it is a joke. Of course, my kids' birthdays are about them, not me.", "NTA \n\nThere are a lot of red flags with mom\u2019s behavior.", "NTA WTF.  Get out of there as soon as you can.", "No, she never has, even though I never eat anything with lactose in it (at least not by choice).", "I have a friend who's mother didn't believe she was lactose intolerant and made her eat food with lactose in it (this happened when she was a kid). I don't know how  this got overlooked for so long. Now she can't eat a huge variety of foods because her allergic reactions caused some permanent damage. Please don't let your mom bully you into eating food you shouldn't.", "NTA you cannot change the behavior of others, but you can change your own and be in control of the situation. My husband used to state he didn't think birthdays were a big deal - I happen to enjoy it. So instead of getting mad I celebrated the way I wanted to - I bought what I wanted, went shopping, spent the day at a museum. I saw friends, ate the perfect birthday meal - truly enjoyed myself. My husband now makes an effort - not perfect but I appreciate it. Your mother will not change but don't allow her the power to ruin it for you. For your next birthday plan what YOU want to do, if your mother complains tell her you're sorry she feels that way and move on", "NTA She sounds abusive.", "Yep sounds like you may need to check out r/raisedbynarcissists - wild", "Hey OP, I just want you to know there was nothing you could have done differently to avoid your mother's unhinged reaction. It wasn't your fault, you are not in the wrong, and, even if she frames it as if you are, you are not in trouble. You are NTA. Your mom, however, is a big one, and I'm sure she's like that in a lot of other aspects in your life as well. \n\nI really would recommend looking up resources from people who are licensed on dealing with a Narcissistic parent and trauma. Even just videos on youtube, like Patrick Teahan as one example, can have a big impact on realising how much something like that affects your life and worldview. It took me from being like, \"Oh but she's only like that *sometimes*. It's not abuse.\" to \"Oh, I should have left this house before I even thought about starting college.\" which is stressful and unfair to have to think about because of someone else but it's reality.", "NTA Your MA is a jerk and AH.  As soon as you are able move out.  What she is doing is mentally abusive.", "NTA. She can\u2019t have it both ways - from the fact that she still pushed to have multiple kids despite her medical challenges and then saying you ruined her life. She chose this path! \n\nBut also, what mom picks up a birthday cake that the birthday child can\u2019t even eat? And then to punish you on top of that. \n\nConsider going low contact with your mom once you\u2019re a legal adult and can move out.", "When I read stories like yours, where a parent is obviously an AH and OB is powerless, I'd like to remind that soon you'll be out of that situation and you can choose NC whenever you want.\nMy recommendation is to study hard, plan your future, be extremely careful with sex life and be strong.", "NTA. Your mother is abusive. And your dad just allows this? Okay...\n\nMaybe spend the next year planning and saving so you can tell your mom to kick rocks ASAP. You're 17, dealing with her is entirely optional in one year.", "NTA\nHonestly, that is such a horrible thing for her to do, she should celebrate herself on mothers day, but your birthday is only yours to celebrate.", "NTA\n\nIm so sorry your mother is a self-centered AH", "NTA.  Please go out and have fun with your friends on your birthday in the future.  You can ignore the party she's throwing for herself.", "Get yourself a cake she can't eat or doesn't like.", "Precisely.", "Make sure to not buy her anything for mothers day and instead buy yourself a gift and let her know that only thanks to you she is a mother, so she should be grateful . Oh and buy a cake she won't eat", "Take comfort that next year you will be able to move out and deprive her of one of her celebration days.  NTA but mom needs help.", "Nta! \"Mom thank you for birthing me! I appreciate that! Do your friends steal their children's bdays? Or is this just you?\"\nMother's day I would run around crazy like it's your birthday!! Tell her how none of this would be possible without you and ur brother!", "NTA this is abusive"]}
