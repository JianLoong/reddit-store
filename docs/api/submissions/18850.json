My husband used to state he didn't think birthdays were a big deal - I happen to enjoy it. So instead of getting mad I celebrated the way I wanted to - I bought what I wanted, went shopping, spent the day at a museum. I saw friends, ate the perfect birthday meal - truly enjoyed myself. My husband now makes an effort - not perfect but I appreciate it. Your mother will not change but don't allow her the power to ruin it for you. For your next birthday plan what YOU want to do, if your mother complains tell her you're sorry she feels that way and move on", "NTA She sounds abusive.", "Yep sounds like you may need to check out r/raisedbynarcissists - wild"]}
