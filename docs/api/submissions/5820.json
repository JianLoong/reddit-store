She had a concussion and there was a bit of brain damage that made her extremely difficult when she was little. She was always perfect at school or outside of the home but when they got home she'd let go and honestly was a little terror. Thankfully she got better as she got older and with therapy you can't tell that she's different except she has a little trouble focusing.  When my husband and his ex divorced, she dropped Amelia off at his house and said she didn't want anything to do with her. We honestly think there was something between Amelia and her mom because it was night and day when she started staying with her dad full time but we can't prove anything. I adopted Amelia right after I married my husband and she's doing great emotionally.\n\nAmelia was diagnosed with Leukemia 3 months ago. She goes to a private school where home hospital school or an online program isn't an option. They've just been excusing most of her assignments and we've been trying to keep up by reading the books, looking at lecture slides and notes from her peers, and by doing maybe 1 assignment per class per week (ends up being 1 assignment per day, which is all she can handle right now). Her school is willing to keep this up next semester but she's not learning much. We need her to get a good education so we pulled her out of her school and enrolled her in a public school. We set her up with a 504 plan and after winter break a teacher will come to work with her 3 days a week. \n\nAmelia has been at this school since kindergarten and was very sad to leave so I planned a weekend shopping trip to get her mind off things. I rented us a cute apartment, we spent the first day shopping and at a spa. the second day we went to a town maybe 40 minutes away and checked out all of the small shops then spent the rest of the day in the pool. \n\nNicole was supposed to join us for this trip. Then the night before we were supposed to leave, we caught her sneaking out to go to a party we told her she couldn't go to. She was grounded and that included the weekend trip. \n\nAmelia picked out some clothes and toys for her younger siblings while we were out but Nicole is pretty hard to shop for so she didn't get as much. \n\nWhen we got home, she was already upset that we went without her then when she saw that her siblings got more gifts than them, she started to yell, said that I've always hated her and grounded her as an excuse to keep her from going on this trip. She went to her mom's house early and her mom called me to berate me for leaving Nicole out.", "created_utc": 1672192705, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwx449/aita_for_not_including_my_stepdaughter_in_a/", "score": 56, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Her mom has no cause to call you on this, she should be calling your husband. Nicole was punished for something she DID and was CAUGHT doing, and is now acting out as a way to try to throw responsibility of off herself to apologize for her inappropriate behavior.

She's 13, what on earth was she sneaking out to go to a party for? If you don't deter her from this kind of behaviour now it will get worse later. \n\nI think it was absolutely reasonable to not take her, she should be grateful that her sister brought her back gifts at all.", "NTA. She was grounded because she was sneaking out when she was told no, not because you hate her. Chances are that it was more her dad that came up with the punishment than you.

I don\u2019t think it was wrong to punish Nicole for sneaking out.  However, she obviously doesn\u2019t feel like she is valued as a part of your family and you don\u2019t seem to care at all about this. You suck for seemingly caring more about whether or not you were the asshole than helping Nicole. This could just be the way your post reads, but it doesn\u2019t seem like you care about Nicole.

I assume there was going to be alcohol and little supervision.\n\nYou did the right thing. Worst case scenario she could have climbed into a vehicle with someone heavily intoxicated and died.

Removing her from the weekend trip is debatable but I think it\u2019s pretty warranted, it\u2019s not like it was a family trip with every kid but her.

To me it's not the fact you stopped her from going on the trip (but honestly well adjusted and happy teenagers generally don't feel the need to sneak out btw) as punishment.

To all these people saying it\u2019s your job to make sure it\u2019s equal, a 16 year old is old enough to determine how much time, energy and money she wants to spend on her siblings. Sounds like the bigger issue is the tension between the sisters because of the relationship with bio mom and how it bleeds into your relationship too. That just makes bio mom the AH.

Depending on what she\u2019s is telling the kids, Nicole may blame you for things you have nothing to do with.

Kids like everyone have different personalities and want different things. \n\nAlso I can understand the hard to shop for thing that most people are trying to call you out for.

Perhaps Nicole is attention seeking out of fear of losing sister and how her life has also been affected by her sister's illness.

You highlighted the multiple ways you helped Amelia before she was sick and the things you\u2019re doing to accommodate her illness, while Nicole is barely mentioned until it comes to you punishing her. Her sister is sick and getting a lot of attention, and there\u2019s no thought to how that might be attributing to reckless, attention seeking behavior from a young teen going through hormonal changes? She definitely needs some one on one time and to feel included.", "So you are treating her worse since the beginning just because you don\u2019t want to make any effort for her?

Sister described a bag she wanted and some clothes she likes. Brother was similar. I was difficult. I said I only wanted a few very specific things. Brother and sister both got clothes and sister got 2 new bags. I didn't get anything because I was too picky and either they couldn't find exactly what I asked for or it was too expensive. Sure it sucked when I didn't get anything but that's because I made it difficult.", "Both. The things we got her were more expensive than what we got for her siblings but she also has expensive taste and I'm not going to spend a lot of money on clothes, jewelry, or makeup if there's a good chance it'll sit in the back of her closet because it's not what she wanted.", "From her comments, it doesn\u2019t sound as if she even likes Nicole very much.", "She was supposed to. It was a girls trip and 13 year old blew it. Sneaking out is not okay. If she was being mouthy and they cancelled, maybe I could see your point. Kids need boundaries and they need to learn that there are consequences for bad choices.  She was going to a 21 birthday party. What is she got drunk and something happened to her because 21st birthday parties get rowdy?

Kid already doesn't like you but I'm sure you don't care about fixing it because you keep doubling down with this BS. Idc about a trip you took a million years ago. Tell it to your stepdaughter and see if she cares.", "So to be clear, who got what? Did little bro get 10 gifts valued together at $100 and Nicole got 2 gifts valued at $100?", "I agree. A sick sister and a stepmom that doesn\u2019t like you. Lucky her \ud83d\ude11", "Agree to disagree.  You have some valid points but I don\u2019t agree with all.", "This! OP response makes it feel like she doesn't really like or care about Nicole.  You can't tell me as a parent you didn't see the disparity in gifts and not know that it was going to make Nicole feel left out or like she was being treated as less than to all the other kids in the family.  I'm really curious as to what the dad thinks. If he is ok with one of his kids being singled out in this way. I can't help but wonder if OP might have negatively feelings towards Nicole because of her mother."]}
