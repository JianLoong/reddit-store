If you wrote this crap on an application, I'd bin it straight away knowing that this can only lead to complications in the long term - both behaviourally and physically. Your dog needs a balanced diet that is biologically appropriate. Your dog needs boundaries.

Fair enough to feed him suitable leftovers after you have finished but not as part of the meal.  \n\nHe now associates you eating a meal as his time for food as well.

My dad had a dachshund that would scream bloody murder the entire time we'd eat and he'd encourage it by giving him food. Train your dog if you love him so much.", "YTA. You\u2019re creating bad habits with your dog and potentially causing health issues. A dog doesn\u2019t require spaghetti - carbs like spaghetti aren\u2019t needed for a dog. Feed a balanced, dog appropriate meal otherwise, you\u2019ll cause him to be overweight and unhealthy. Begging from the table is straight out wrong and a crappy habit to break.

She cooked the meal for you and her, not for the dog. It was disrespectful of you to ignore that.\n\nAllowing or encouraging your dog to beg when people are eating is poor dog ownership. You need to train him not to do that, not encourage him.\n\nAlso, while he is your dog, it is 100% reasonable for your GF to say 'No' to him when his is bothering her and begging at her. \n\nAs a dog owner you need to take responsibility for ensuring that your dog behaves around other people, if you don't, you are being a massive AH. And if you don't control your dog,  you don't get to complain when others take steps  stop him bothering them. \n\nIf you personally want to let him beg from you, then you need to work out how to train him so he knows it is only you he can do that with, not everyone. \n\nAlso, think about his health. He doesn't need noodles or other human food , he would be far healthier of you focus on giving him appropriate meals (and, if you want, treats) designed for a dog.", "1) People's food is not dogs'food, there's a reason they have specific food in vets and supermarkets.\n\n2) The fact that your dog \"harasses\" (I don't remember the best word right now sorry) people while they're at the table eating, means clearly that he was not taught to respect people when they eat. I've had many friends that thought this was cute, until the dog started getting aggressive when in regards to food. There's a reason dogs are taught to respect when we eat, it's a pack thing, the \"boss\" eats first and the others should respect it. In your house you should be the boss (even if we think of our pets as family, we need to realise they have a different societal structure and act accordingly).\n\n3) letting your pet \"jump\"/put his paws on you etc when you're eating can cause disgust to a lot of people, and it's fair, dogs don't wash their paws, butts, mouths etc.\n\n4) Just because you treat your dog like he's your son, you cannot expect others (including your gf) to do the same\n\n5) She was preparing food for the two of you. Respect HER boundaries, or make your expectations clear (before she starts cooking say something like \"Can you do some extra XXXX, unseasoned, so I can give it to my dog?), and don't forget that she can and has every right to refuse.\n\nIn her shoes, I would've left as well. I'm not going to cook for a dog that I think is untrained and needs better manners. Even when I go to my parents (they have a dog that is not as bad as yours, but still not 100% trained), I don't do the same things they do. I try to show him that in there, I am the boss and he will respect me (no hitting or anything, just not letting him have leftovers/people food, not letting him jump on me or my bf when he comes with me, etc).\n\nSo, in conclusion... YTA", "YTA. At least you an your dog have something in common: your IQ.", "YTA it\u2019s fine to give your dog a little treat if safe human food on occasion.

Sorry, dogs are cool and all, but the way you are coddling yours is actually ridiculous. Responsible pet owners train their animals.

Nothing more disgusting than going to someone's house trying to have a meal and watching a dog sit beside you begging for food you're causing this I don't blame her she is right and thinking a dog should not be begging for food at a table.
