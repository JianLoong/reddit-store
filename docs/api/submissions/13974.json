My girlfriend has more than a few guy friends, and I'm not one of those guys that thinks men and women can't be friends. However, with 2 of these guys, it's very clear that they want more than just friendship from her.  Like clear as day to the point where I don't get how she doesn't see it. If I can notice just by the weird energy they try to exude when I'm present, she should  be able to get too right? Wrong.\n\nAny time I have pointed this out, she gets upset with me. She tells me that I am being jealous and reading into things, that aren't there. I argue back that I'm just letting her know and as a guy, I can probably tell much better than she can since women tend to be a little slow regarding things like this. So 2 nights ago night, she was hanging out with her friends and this guy was present. From what she told me, they were all drinking and he said some things that implied he'd want to be with her. She was made uncomfortable by this and the night ended shortly after.\n\nFast forward to yesterday morning. She got a series of texts apologizing for what he said, and then backpedaling and saying he would treat her so much better than me and she's wasting her time with me. She of course said no and was upset with him. After she told me, I just read the texts and simply said, \"Wow who could've seen this coming\" a bit sarcastically. \n\nThis set her off and she got mad. She said that I was being such a huge asshole to her and she had no way of seeing this coming. She's been pissed at me since.\n\n AITA?", "created_utc": 1680613865, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12biqcg/aita_for_telling_my_girlfriend_that_i_told_her_so/", "score": 2864, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Now I know that whenever I need to determine if something a man says to me is just a sincere, harmless compliment vs. him subtly hitting on me, I can just ask someone with a faster man brain to help me out. Yay! I learned something today!\n\nYTA\n\nETA - to all of the people below going \"but women do this to men too!\" - I don't condone that either, nor does it make OP's above statement any less offensive. Sweeping generalizations about gender are not effective tools when communicating with your partner about interpersonal issues. It's about as helpful as an \"I told ya so!\" to your upset partner who just lost a friend when their trust was violated.", "YTA\nSo someone made your GF uncomfortable, overstepped boundarys, she did everything right, told him to get lost, and instead of comforting her and make sure she ist okay, you scold her? Are you insane?\nShe lost a friend and was harrassed, and you tell her she deserved it? \nHuge AH.", "I was on your side until I read \"I can probably tell much better than she can since women tend to be a little slow regarding things like this.\" And then I read more that showed you should have been supportive of her and not an AH towards her. So yes, YTA.", "YTA,   \nYour reactions like *\"Wow who could've seen this coming\"* and  *\"I can probably tell much better than she can since women tend to be a little slow regarding things like this.\"*  wasn't appropriate, in fact, its childish, and this is how you break apart her bond with you. You need to support your partner, not put them down.   \nBe aware of what you are saying, and what you are trying to say, and how it affects other people.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a big betrayal when this happens. It sucks to realize you care about someone as a friend and they\u2019ve not only had ulterior motives, but are actively willing to assert that you don\u2019t know your own mind and have chosen the wrong boyfriend. She likely assured herself this wasn\u2019t the case in her own way, and he either hid it well or she\u2019s just learning more about this dynamic and was fooled. She\u2019s likely feeling very hurt, stupid, and betrayed, and the appropriate response in the moment was to comfort her. Later, if you must, you can offer some ways you think it was given away but you needed to separate your resentment towards him from her experience of a loss of a friend. You failed to support her and you owe her an apology. \n\nAlso if you said the \u201cgirls are slower\u201d thing no wonder she didn\u2019t take your word for it. That\u2019s insulting and inaccurate. What is accurate is that he likely behaves differently when you\u2019re around and you clearly didn\u2019t like him so it\u2019s easy to chalk it up to an interpersonal thing. Eg, my friend doesn\u2019t like my boyfriend, not that my friend doesn\u2019t like that I *have* a boyfriend.", "NTA but C'mon man, there was no need to gloat. She's probably also sad that someone she thought of as a friend disrespected her relationship and basically only wanted to hang around with her just to date her.", "YTA - for your jackass condescending attitude about this. \n\nYou\u2019re not even seeing that your girlfriend was honest with you, talked about it with you, clearly chose you over that person. She could have easily not said anything but she\u2019s coming to you, as a partner, and you\u2019re here stomping around like an ass because you were right. That\u2019s what was most important to you. \n\nI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she doesn\u2019t come to you with things like this anymore because of how you made her feel.", "YTA\nNo one likes 'I told you so'\nIt isn't a helpful comment to make.", "I\u2019m going to go with YTA for A) saying that girls are a bit slow and B) for gloating.   Your gf was likely really hurt by the way her friend acted and you rubbed salt into the wound.", "I'm not sure theres any assholes here.\n\nAs a girl with a lot of guy friends where one of them ends crushing on us: its uncomfortable. It sucks that we end up in this spot where we see we can't even have a good friendship with someone where it is just that, a friendship.\n\nHeres where you could be TA: you're rubbing it in, for some reason? Yeah you saw it coming, she most likely did too, dont be that naive. But what was she gonna do? Imply right away she wasn't interested? Stop talking to him? That just sets up a weird mood and ruins what could actually be a friendship once the people involved realize they should back off. Besides if its a set group of friends it would just make it very awkward overall.\n\nShe's your gf. Support her. That easy.", "YTA , You're just gloating about being right , rather than appreciating the fact she's turned the guy down in favor of you.", "Yta and the fact that you can\u2019t tell shows that the only one slow here is you.", "YTA.\n\nYou didn't have to kick her while she was down.  If you had to say *something*, if you just couldn't stop yourself, it could have been more like \"I'm so sorry, that's why I tried to warn you\" instead of sarcastic mockery.", "NTA. But rubbing her nose in it is counterproductive. Perhaps sit down and have an adult talk?", "YTA\n\nAny adult who says \"I told you so\" or any variation of that is an asshole 90% of the time. Those comments are only made to hurt to other person. Grow up.", "YTA, it feels like you care more about making sure she feels stupid and wrong than you care about forging a positive path for the future when you approach it this way.", "YTA. It\u2019s disappointing and hurtful to find out someone you thought was a friend had an agenda. It probably made her feel objectified and question her other friendships. Don\u2019t be a jerk about it. You\u2019re kicking someone when they\u2019re down.", "YTA, yeah you might be right, but all you\u2019re doing is making them feel like a fool when they\u2019re already upset. It\u2019s not helpful and just makes you appear like a know-it-all. What exactly was the intent of your comment? To make them laugh or to make them feel stupid? \n\nI joke about pretty much everything with my partner but if it was a serious situation I would still bite my tongue rather than say \u201cI told you so\u201d. Just opens the door for them to say it back to you one day. Swallow your comment and give them a shoulder to cry on instead imo.", "bro u are NTA these ppl here lying.", "YTA.  \n\n\nThe only thing worse than a sore loser is a sore winner.", "YTA for how you approached this. Your gf didn't want to lose someone she thought was a good friend because he only had romantic feelings. It's a rough go for anyone.\n\nYou weren't wrong (except you were wrong to attribute being \"slow\" to wanting to be accepted as a friend and person. Sexist without actually thinking about the reasons why women ignore certain behaviors) but you were an AH. Not the time for an \"I told you so\"", "NTA, but it may be worth it to sit her down and tell her that you say these things to give her a heads up not because you're jealous. Explain that it's frustrating that you're trying to look out for her and being dismissed only to watch it happen and have her act like it was unavoidable or unforeseeable. Tell her you're sorry if your delivery made her feel stupid but you would appreciate if she took your advice into account in the future.", "So you have a girlfriend who is not only showing you she is outright loyal to you, but is also oblivious to the passive advance of other guys.\n\nMost fellows would consider this a boon. I\u2019m not quite comprehending your issue - you\u2019d rather she pick up on it, exclude them from her life maybe? That\u2019s a stretch of an ask from a partner already showing you, quite literally, that her only interest is you.\n\nYTA", "NTA. You knew this was coming and she got angry when you tried to warn her. For all the people calling OP the AH, how can OP let her know what he sees? OP has already said he can't believe she doesn't see what is front of her, and when it happens she is still blindsided. I think gf was angry at herself but the sarcasm made it easy to turn it on OP. It's gonna happen again with guy #2 and the cycle is gonna repeat. So how does OP prevent it if she won't believe him?", "I don't understand all the Y-T-A votes. If the genders were reversed we'd be calling the female OP N-T-A. At best this is an ESH, mainly because OP was sarcastic.", "NTA your attitude isn\u2019t great but you are correct in this instance. I\u2019d be worried your gf secretly likes it though. Is she really that clueless? Or does she like the attention?", "ESH. She should have taken your observations more into consideration but you shouldn\u2019t be gloating either. She just lost one of her best guy friends", "YTA but a small one. You usually wait until after she's gotten over it to say that so it comes off more as a joke rather than rubbing salt in a wound. She's still wrapping her head around the fact that her friend wasn't a friend at all", "NTA - The cheek of her to say no way to see it coming when you had repeatedly done so and warned her.", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn't block this guy immediately and stop hanging out with him after he's made his intentions known **and** told her to dump you for him, then you need to leave her.  She doesn't respect you.", "NTA she's being intentionally obtuse", "YTA - Dude, your gf just lost someone she thought was a friend and you are making her feel worse! It's not time for \"I told you so!\"  Be a good bf and support her. Grow the f up!", "YTA. One of her friends just possibly ruined their friendship -  and let me tell you, it's heartbreaking to learn that one of your friends didn't actually value your friendship - and instead of being sympathetic and supportive, you decided to jump to \"told you so\". \n\nYou may be better at telling when a guy is just interested in a woman for sex, but you obviously don't understand how it feels to be the woman in that scenario. You think someone values you as a person, but really they're just being nice to try to find a way into your pants? It sucks. It hurts. So why would you make the conscious decision to add to that pain?", "YTA.\n\nYour gf is dealing with someone who she thought was a friend making inappropriate advances at her. This can feel like a violation and a betrayal. A loving boyfriend would understand she is now struggling with everything she thought about her friendship with this person, struggling with how to trust and believe people, and how to navigate that friendship going forward. And here you are giving an \"I told you so\" rather than being empathetic. \n\nYTA the also just for how you talk about her not seeing it and saying women are slow. No. Maybe we just are able to view relationships beyond sex so give people the benefit of the doubt. \n\nDo you even like or respect your girlfriend? Honestly?", " *I argue back that I'm just letting her know and as a guy, I can probably tell much better than she can since women tend to be a little slow regarding things like this.*\n\nI guess the other guy was right when he texted :\n\n*he would treat her so much better than me and she's wasting her time with me.*\n\nYTA", "I *think* what you meant to say was \u2018it\u2019s often easier for an outsider to spot these things\u2019 rather that tell all women that men know better.\n\nYou were doing the \u2018I told you so\u2019 which is never a good look.\n\nYTA", "NTA but I was literally laughing out loud at your post. I have friends and had partners like this. It is frustrating in a harmless way.", "Lol, no. NTA.\n\nI get it from you - it's such an eye-roll moment. However, some people don't like sarcasm much and it seems unnecessary to fall out over it. Sit her down and explain the red flags you saw (not just \"I knew\". Things like \"he got too close to you\" or \"his comments were inappropriate\") and tell her your point of view. If she refuses to see this, then she's in denial and I would GTFO.", "NTA. Most people are saying YTA for the \u201cwow who could\u2019ve seen this coming\u201d, but the fact is that you were RIGHT, and nowhere in your story did she affirm that you had been right all along. If she had said \u201cOP you were right, and I shouldn\u2019t have dismissed your perspective so quickly\u201d, you probably wouldn\u2019t have felt any need to say \u201cI told you so\u201d. What\u2019s most important now is that you both work together so that in the future, you are playing on the same team, instead of \u201cme vs her\u201d", "YTA for rubbing it in her face. But I would be questioning my relationship if my partner continued a friendship with someone that hit on them. That\u2019s not a friend, that\u2019s someone hovering and waiting for a chance to get with them.", "ESH. She shouldn\u2019t have called you jealous and you shouldn\u2019t gloat.", "Shocking to some but I'm going with NTA, though your comment about knowing better than her would irk any woman so chill with that crap.  The fact is that you could clearly see something that she was in denial about and then when it happened you brought it to her attention that you've warned her several times and all she could do was get mad - she got mad because she knew you were right.   I've tried to be friends with guys before and have been in denial about how they feel about me until it eventually comes out\u2026 it really sucks and as a woman you don't want to admit that someone that you care about as a friend could just be hanging around just to get in your pants but it is a sad fact.  It's also a fact that some women actually like this kind of attention and prefer to not cut them off because they enjoy being admired. So I wonder if your girlfriend was really that oblivious, or if she knew all along and chose to ignore it until confronted with the situation. In any case, not the asshole.\n\nEdited to add: some of your responses make you an asshole though.  Geez dude...", "YTA Yes, you warned her. When someone you care about doesn't listen to you, the last thing they want to hear is \"I told you so\". You were  sarcastic and rude when one of her friends let her down. You should have been supportive, and that makes you the asshole. You owe her an apology - a heartfelt one.\n\nAnd everyone around you wants you to stop generalizing about women and men because whether your plumbing is indoor or outdoor doesn't affect your your ability to trust friends.", "ESH I get where you come from but it's useless to comment more on this at this point so yeah just don't comment about it, she was upset with him that should be enough for you", "YTA for not appreciating the fact that she wanted to be with *you*, defended *you* to the guy hitting on her, only to have *you* rub her nose in her mistake in the end. \n\nDude, you handled this badly. Don't be surprised if she ends up with the other guy after all.", "YTA, you sound just as bad or even worse than this guy.", "YTA. She just lost a friend.

Women are often put in the unfortunate position of believing something reasonable- that people view them as humans and not just sex objects- and it's really painful to find out that someone you trusted as a friend was looking for a chance to hit all along. It's a real AH move to push the blame back onto her while she's dealing with a friend that betrayed her trust. \nIt's not a matter of being slow, it's a matter of perception. Some men get way ahead of themselves over simple things. A girl remembers something they said from a previous conversation- \"damn, that must mean she wants to date me.\" A girl compliments a well put-together outfit- \"that means she wants to f*ck.\" Some men read really deeply into these simple, small talk level kindnesses and take them really personally. Woman, on the other hand, seem to be more comfortable giving and receiving compliments and just paying general attention to another person in a conversation. So women tend to think behavior like this is normal, friendly banter and not realize that the guy can't take simple kindness without building up a fantasy in his mind. \nYou should be supporting her, and mourning with her that she lost a friend instead of shoving it in her face that her \"friend\" was just waiting for an opportunity to transcend the \"friend zone.\"", "Wow, \"women tend to be a little slow regarding things like this,\" really?  I hope your not listening to that Tate asshole.", "YTA. It was a childish response, you probably could have just been comforting.

While saying \"women tend to be a bit slow\" was just a horrendous way of saying that as a straight male, you can identify with other straight males better than she can, I really dunno how else you were supposed to react here. You tried to warn you, she brushes you off. Honestly, a single sarcastic phrase when the inevitable happens isn't out of line. If you rubbed it in her face for weeks, then you'd be the asshole.\n\nFolks in this thread, lesson to learn here: if you ignore someone's justified warnings and this happens, suck it up, accept the sarcastic comment, and eat the crow that you served yourself.", "NTA.\n\nYou had a gut feeling, were honest about it with her, let her know, and she should have honored that instead of still engaging.\n\nMy wife was flirted with by a married man a few weeks ago.

My girlfriend has more than a few guy friends, and I'm not one of those guys that thinks men and women can't be friends. However, with 2 of these guys, it's very clear that they want more than just friendship from her.  Like clear as day to the point where I don't get how she doesn't see it. If I can notice just by the weird energy they try to exude when I'm present, she should  be able to get too right? Wrong.\n\nAny time I have pointed this out, she gets upset with me. She tells me that I am being jealous and reading into things, that aren't there. I argue back that I'm just letting her know and as a guy, I can probably tell much better than she can since women tend to be a little slow regarding things like this. So 2 nights ago night, she was hanging out with her friends and this guy was present. From what she told me, they were all drinking and he said some things that implied he'd want to be with her. She was made uncomfortable by this and the night ended shortly after.\n\nFast forward to yesterday morning. She got a series of texts apologizing for what he said, and then backpedaling and saying he would treat her so much better than me and she's wasting her time with me. She of course said no and was upset with him. After she told me, I just read the texts and simply said, \"Wow who could've seen this coming\" a bit sarcastically. \n\nThis set her off and she got mad. She said that I was being such a huge asshole to her and she had no way of seeing this coming. She's been pissed at me since.\n\n AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I can\u2019t imagine something like this happening and to have no support from the person who supposedly loves me.", "I don't get the Y T A.

Taking it as an insult seems odd to me. \n\nSecond, he uses the word \"tends\" meaning he doesn't believe ALL women are slower at it then men, so I disagree with your points about it insulting an entire gender or being pointed at all women, even if you do find the word slow to be insulting. He's just stating a general pattern that men notice men's emotions faster, and that doesn't seem at all controversial to me. \n\nLike, I could say men tend to be stronger, or women tend to be better at detail oriented work, but that's not the same as saying all men are stronger than all women, or all women are better at details than all men. Noticing a pattern is not the same as saying all members of a group act a specific way.\n\nEither way, if you find the language insulting that's fine. I disagree, but my main complaint is about the double standard, not whether the actual words are insulting. As long as the reaction is consistent no matter which group is being stereotyped, and not a thing that's ignored when women say it, while men get dog piled for it. Just finding the phrase insulting is okay as long as it's not a double standard, and I've already said I think OP was the asshole for the I told you so, so my overall judgement matches yours. I just disagree that the sentence you have a problem with is actually insulting.", "Do you have a link to the posts?", "Any chance for a link?", "No, but for calling him jealous only for him to be right?", "She called him jealous when he pointed this out originally.", "You can't use being blind as an excuse when someone you trust is reading signs for you.", "Hahaha love it, thanks", "Yeah, this is the most clear ESH I have seen in a while.  People on here need to get a grip.", "While I don't agree with his reaction I understand why it would be frustrating and telling someone I see these signs and being told no you don't you're just jealous. It's not right but it's a lot more understandable than people are making it seem", "100% if genders were reversed OP would have waves of NTA.", "I'm not disagreeing, but there was a better way to phrase it so that people wouldn't have gotten tripped up over it.", "That one sentence says a lot about how he thinks about women in general. It speaks to his character, and doesnt make him look good at all.", "But OP wasn\u2019t like that, not as far as we can tell. I accept that there are jealous, possessive men who act like that, and if OP was saying that about every guy she interacted with that wasn\u2019t family, then I\u2019d understand. But OP was saying it about _one guy_ and that was it.", "But that's not at all what happened. He said it was only this one that behaved in ways that led him to think that. No other male friend of hers got his radar up. This isn't on the bf.", "That's an assumption, yta.", "Generally speaking, every other man _does_ want to bang her.\n\nThat doesn't mean they _will_ try to bang her. Most men can restrain themselves and won't try to sleep with other women when they are in a relationship, when the woman is already taken, when there is some aspect about her that would make such a relationship problematic.\n\nThat doesn't change that men want ssx.", "Oh I\u2019m not weighing in on that. Just strongly disagreeing with the sentiment I\u2019m seeing that she \u201cput herself in this position\u201d and \u201chad it coming\u201d", "\"Maybe she's from Canada and she's just being polite...\" dying right now lmao", "It\u2019s also good to point out that he doesn\u2019t feel this way about all of her male friends, and seems to have no problem with her having male friends, so I wouldn\u2019t call him jealous", "Writing off your partners\u2019 instincts is kind of an asshole move. Weird energy is a real thing. Presumably we\u2019ve all seen two people interact and thought he/she is into him/her. Its sometimes hard to pinpoint but i absolutely do notice it more with men than women.\n\nI\u2019ll also say this, i would never call my wife jealous because she instinctually didn\u2019t trust someone.", "Pretty sure what he meant by weird energy was tension. It is absolutely there when two guys like the same girl and all three are hanging out.", "And yet, he was right", "Give em this \ud83e\udd47", "A lot of the things that would make a guy creepy are done specifically when there are no other guys around though, so they wouldn't have seen it", "You doin' okay? You're sounding a bit unhinged.", "Oh no I\u2019d never be friends with those kinds of people.\n\nIt\u2019s happened to me countless times in the workplace. \n\nFor example I once had two women colleagues who were very friendly with each other tell me they were going to report me for checking my personal email on the work computer. They quieted down real quick when I said I equally would like to clarify with our boss exactly what was permitted on the work computers as I saw them online shop, browse Facebook, etc. every single day. \n\nThey had no reason to tattle on me other than just to be assholes and single me out. When they did it, it was ok. But when I did it, it wasn\u2019t\u2026yet I wasn\u2019t doing half the stuff they were. \n\nThere were so many more instances of this exact type of behavior over my course of employment there that I eventually ended up leaving.", "Jesus Christ. He was right, good for him. No need to kick her when she's down, that's a dick move. He's meant to love this woman", "The whole thing is incredibly frustrating.\n\n1. You see something that someone else hasn't noticed and might not like.\n2. You warn them about it.\n3. They accuse you of being some negative trait and thus are making it all up.\n4. Thing happens that you tried to warn them about.\n5. They come crying about it to you and might even make a comment about how they never saw this coming.\n6. You're now expected to pretend there was no way to see it coming and ignore how shitty they were in step 3.\n\nI don't see \"I told you so\" as gloating so much as finally being able to call out that shittiness because now it's obviously not just something being made up. Maybe don't just dismiss what I've been trying to tell you and insult me at the same time and I'd feel more sympathy that you're sad about being \"blindsided\" by the very thing I tried to warn you about.", "That may be true, but that sentence does not show that.  He is saying that sometimes women are oblivious to a man's actual intentions. This is the same for men as well with the women.  This is easily ESH.", "Keep that same energy next time you see someone say \u201cmen are oblivious to signals\u201d bet you don\u2019t. In reality you\u2019re just outraged over something minuscule that you perceive as sexist because thats just the redditor way.", "Fair enough but people are coming hard down on him being TA when it seems obvious there is a lot of blame on both sides.", "Absolutely one of my favourites.", "Or even just negging \n\nGf has a lesbian friend that would neg me and basically insult me but frame it as a joke/jest. So if I got made then I'm automatically the asshole since I can't take a joke\n\nOr her ex that she tried to stay friends. If I was around he was an asshole and leave early from places. If I wadnt around he was super sweet and would stay out all night long with her\n\nPretty hard to not see exactly the reasoning. Yet I brought it up and was just jealous", "Just because you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you", "He was, but he was an AH about it, so here we are", "She already kicked him. Isn\u2019t she supposed to love him?", "I mean, I think a sarcastic \"gee, who could have seen that coming\" was warranted and not an asshole move, considering he warned her several times, and each time she brushed him off and claimed that he was being jealous.", "Hahaha yes she did and she is supposed to love him ad well. Good point but people on Reddit love demonize Men for any action they did or didn't do."]}
