So yes, YTA.", "YTA,   \nYour reactions like *\"Wow who could've seen this coming\"* and  *\"I can probably tell much better than she can since women tend to be a little slow regarding things like this.\"*  wasn't appropriate, in fact, its childish, and this is how you break apart her bond with you. You need to support your partner, not put them down.   \nBe aware of what you are saying, and what you are trying to say, and how it affects other people.", "YTA\n\nIt\u2019s a big betrayal when this happens. It sucks to realize you care about someone as a friend and they\u2019ve not only had ulterior motives, but are actively willing to assert that you don\u2019t know your own mind and have chosen the wrong boyfriend. She likely assured herself this wasn\u2019t the case in her own way, and he either hid it well or she\u2019s just learning more about this dynamic and was fooled. She\u2019s likely feeling very hurt, stupid, and betrayed, and the appropriate response in the moment was to comfort her. Later, if you must, you can offer some ways you think it was given away but you needed to separate your resentment towards him from her experience of a loss of a friend. You failed to support her and you owe her an apology. \n\nAlso if you said the \u201cgirls are slower\u201d thing no wonder she didn\u2019t take your word for it. That\u2019s insulting and inaccurate. What is accurate is that he likely behaves differently when you\u2019re around and you clearly didn\u2019t like him so it\u2019s easy to chalk it up to an interpersonal thing. Eg, my friend doesn\u2019t like my boyfriend, not that my friend doesn\u2019t like that I *have* a boyfriend.", "NTA but C'mon man, there was no need to gloat.

Yeah you saw it coming, she most likely did too, dont be that naive. But what was she gonna do? Imply right away she wasn't interested? Stop talking to him?

To make them laugh or to make them feel stupid? \n\nI joke about pretty much everything with my partner but if it was a serious situation I would still bite my tongue rather than say \u201cI told you so\u201d.

Your gf didn't want to lose someone she thought was a good friend because he only had romantic feelings. It's a rough go for anyone.\n\nYou weren't wrong (except you were wrong to attribute being \"slow\" to wanting to be accepted as a friend and person. Sexist without actually thinking about the reasons why women ignore certain behaviors) but you were an AH. Not the time for an \"I told you so\"", "NTA, but it may be worth it to sit her down and tell her that you say these things to give her a heads up not because you're jealous. Explain that it's frustrating that you're trying to look out for her and being dismissed only to watch it happen and have her act like it was unavoidable or unforeseeable. Tell her you're sorry if your delivery made her feel stupid but you would appreciate if she took your advice into account in the future.", "So you have a girlfriend who is not only showing you she is outright loyal to you, but is also oblivious to the passive advance of other guys.\n\nMost fellows would consider this a boon. I\u2019m not quite comprehending your issue - you\u2019d rather she pick up on it, exclude them from her life maybe?

You knew this was coming and she got angry when you tried to warn her. For all the people calling OP the AH, how can OP let her know what he sees? OP has already said he can't believe she doesn't see what is front of her, and when it happens she is still blindsided. I think gf was angry at herself but the sarcasm made it easy to turn it on OP.

If the genders were reversed we'd be calling the female OP N-T-A. At best this is an ESH, mainly because OP was sarcastic.", "NTA your attitude isn\u2019t great but you are correct in this instance. I\u2019d be worried your gf secretly likes it though. Is she really that clueless? Or does she like the attention?", "ESH. She should have taken your observations more into consideration but you shouldn\u2019t be gloating either. She just lost one of her best guy friends", "YTA but a small one. You usually wait until after she's gotten over it to say that so it comes off more as a joke rather than rubbing salt in a wound. She's still wrapping her head around the fact that her friend wasn't a friend at all", "NTA - The cheek of her to say no way to see it coming when you had repeatedly done so and warned her.", "NTA\n\nIf she doesn't block this guy immediately and stop hanging out with him after he's made his intentions known **and** told her to dump you for him, then you need to leave her.  She doesn't respect you.", "NTA she's being intentionally obtuse", "YTA - Dude, your gf just lost someone she thought was a friend and you are making her feel worse! It's not time for \"I told you so!\"  Be a good bf and support her. Grow the f up!", "YTA. One of her friends just possibly ruined their friendship -  and let me tell you, it's heartbreaking to learn that one of your friends didn't actually value your friendship - and instead of being sympathetic and supportive, you decided to jump to \"told you so\". \n\nYou may be better at telling when a guy is just interested in a woman for sex, but you obviously don't understand how it feels to be the woman in that scenario. You think someone values you as a person, but really they're just being nice to try to find a way into your pants? It sucks. It hurts. So why would you make the conscious decision to add to that pain?", "YTA.\n\nYour gf is dealing with someone who she thought was a friend making inappropriate advances at her. This can feel like a violation and a betrayal. A loving boyfriend would understand she is now struggling with everything she thought about her friendship with this person, struggling with how to trust and believe people, and how to navigate that friendship going forward. And here you are giving an \"I told you so\" rather than being empathetic. \n\nYTA the also just for how you talk about her not seeing it and saying women are slow. No. Maybe we just are able to view relationships beyond sex so give people the benefit of the doubt. \n\nDo you even like or respect your girlfriend?

She shouldn\u2019t have called you jealous and you shouldn\u2019t gloat.", "Shocking to some but I'm going with NTA, though your comment about knowing better than her would irk any woman so chill with that crap.  The fact is that you could clearly see something that she was in denial about and then when it happened you brought it to her attention that you've warned her several times and all she could do was get mad - she got mad because she knew you were right.   I've tried to be friends with guys before and have been in denial about how they feel about me until it eventually comes out\u2026 it really sucks and as a woman you don't want to admit that someone that you care about as a friend could just be hanging around just to get in your pants but it is a sad fact.  It's also a fact that some women actually like this kind of attention and prefer to not cut them off because they enjoy being admired.

When someone you care about doesn't listen to you, the last thing they want to hear is \"I told you so\". You were  sarcastic and rude when one of her friends let her down.

Women are often put in the unfortunate position of believing something reasonable- that people view them as humans and not just sex objects- and it's really painful to find out that someone you trusted as a friend was looking for a chance to hit all along. It's a real AH move to push the blame back onto her while she's dealing with a friend that betrayed her trust. \nIt's not a matter of being slow, it's a matter of perception. Some men get way ahead of themselves over simple things. A girl remembers something they said from a previous conversation- \"damn, that must mean she wants to date me.\" A girl compliments a well put-together outfit- \"that means she wants to f*ck.\" Some men read really deeply into these simple, small talk level kindnesses and take them really personally. Woman, on the other hand, seem to be more comfortable giving and receiving compliments and just paying general attention to another person in a conversation. So women tend to think behavior like this is normal, friendly banter and not realize that the guy can't take simple kindness without building up a fantasy in his mind. \nYou should be supporting her, and mourning with her that she lost a friend instead of shoving it in her face that her \"friend\" was just waiting for an opportunity to transcend the \"friend zone.\"", "Wow, \"women tend to be a little slow regarding things like this,\" really?

While saying \"women tend to be a bit slow\" was just a horrendous way of saying that as a straight male, you can identify with other straight males better than she can, I really dunno how else you were supposed to react here. You tried to warn you, she brushes you off. Honestly, a single sarcastic phrase when the inevitable happens isn't out of line. If you rubbed it in her face for weeks, then you'd be the asshole.\n\nFolks in this thread, lesson to learn here: if you ignore someone's justified warnings and this happens, suck it up, accept the sarcastic comment, and eat the crow that you served yourself.", "NTA.\n\nYou had a gut feeling, were honest about it with her, let her know, and she should have honored that instead of still engaging.\n\nMy wife was flirted with by a married man a few weeks ago.

Have a think about things, and if either of ya are willing to possibly sacrifice friendships", "> That's kinda crazy. Its disrespectful to the relationship\n\nIn what way? When he took a swing, she said no - everything went fine. So... what's the issue here, exactly? She clearly maintained her boundaries with him.\n\nAlso -- just because you happened to be right about this person doesn't necessarily vindicate your belief that you have some deeper insight into who likes your girlfriend than she does. It just means you were right about this one guy -- that could absolutely just be chance. Case in point - you lead the post by talking about *two* guys, but there's only been an issue with one of them. Which is to say -- for all your deep *male* insight, you were right precisely half of the time.\n\nFrom where I'm standing, you're hitting 50% of the pitches and acting like you should be granted authority over who she can be friends with on account of your accuracy. Bad look.", "Yes, you should trust her enough to shut this down. It sounds like she did. While navigating through life she\u2019s going to have some people, such as friends and coworkers, be interested in her. You mentioned a couple of guys you suspected are interested in her, but only one recently crossed the line (which she addressed.) So how are the other guys \u201cactively\u201d trying to sabotage your relationship? You don\u2019t actually have trust if she needs to cut out any person that might have an interest in her.", "Ooooff. I agree that she chooses him but she\u2019s also choosing to remain friends with someone that has no respect for her relationship. Not a good look. I\u2019m all for friends of the opposite sex but this is a slippery slope.", "I would think it's more disrespectful to be dismissive and sarcastic when your partner gets harassed by someone who she considered a friend.\n\nYou're meant to be supportive and caring instead you sarcastically prioritised letting her know you were right and she was wrong. How exactly does this help your relationship with her apart from making her feel belittled and stupid?", "The line between smugness and sarcasm is very blurry.", "I meant smug. The OP was peacocking over being right about his GF's male friend on Social Media. It's the definition of being smug . Google it.", "If she had no indication of this in the past, it\u2019s only reasonable she\u2019d not heed the warning?? Because crazy concept, but sometimes it takes feelings things yourSELF and not what OTHERS TELL YOU to see things like this??? God god.", "And being gracious in this situation (or any situation as a matter of fact) doesn't involve saying \"I told you so\" and rubbing it in her face. Doing that makes him TA.", "Respect his deductions? Hey, she was wrong this time, but what if she wasn't? She'd end a friendship just because her boyfriend believes some guy likes her?\n\nI'd say that she should have at least entertained where OP was coming from, but \"respect his deductions\" seems dramatic... and pseudo-sexist.", "No, I understood it. And still thought it was dumb", "I love this phrase.", "If had both cases where he was already their friend or someone recently met. I don't say \"seems like a creep\" just out of nowhere, ot is usually after I observe multiple different things (comments, actuons, etc). \n\nEither way, being willing to ignore a creep and telling a woman her instincts about a guy are wrong when they are not, but also expecting her to believe you when you say some other guy is actually hitting on her is some really interesting mental jujitsu.", "She called him jealous when he pointed this out. He\u2019s not a saint. He supposed to transition directly into being supportive?", "So, then he isn\u2019t an asshole for not being super supportive after being called jealous. That works both ways, doesn\u2019t it?", "That is a little bit of a crazy concept for an adult in a relationship. I generally listen to my partner and assume she's coming from a place of rationality, and don't immediately assume she's jealous or some other negative emotion.", "Nah, he was being gracious with the initial warning. She dug her own grave after that.", "Respecting his deductions only means exactly what your last paragraph said.. what do you mean?\n\nLook up deductions.. you seem to think it means \"commands\" or something based on your reaction.\n\nEdit: I guess expecting your partner to respect your 'awareness' (there.. easier word for you), is sexist now.. but only if you're a guy. TIL (/s)", "God I hope you don't treat people like this in real life. Buh bye now!", "They're completely different words. I don't know how you could think someone could get those mixed up.\n\n\"respect his deductions\" is just a really dramatic way to say that is all I'm saying. When I think \"respect\" used that way, I think, \"respect the law\" or \"respect the rules of the roads\", which of course aren't suggestions.\n\nI'd say, she probably should have \"taken his concerns more seriously\".\n\nIt's really all semantics, I suppose. It's just that sometimes, choice of words can be telling.", "Oh, just saw your edit. No need to be so condescending...\n\nUsing \"awareness\" like that is really vague, and sounds awkward in this context.", "Respecting something doesnt give that 'something' authority over you (or whoever). It just means exactly what u said; taking into consideration, or taking it seriously.\n\nI didn't say, \"obey his 'deductions'\" that wouldnt even make sense lol", "Yeah sorry. I didnt mean to be mean."]}
