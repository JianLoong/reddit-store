After years of trying I finally was able to have a child on my own. I struggled to get pregnant several years but luckily,I had my husband Michael by my side to support.\n\nI was lucky tho,in a sense of Michael works in extreme well paid job so we could afford expensive stuff for an unborn baby. But for some reasons that  annoyed my step sister Joy [30F] a lot , she has four kids on her own and had a miscarriage (which I wasn\u2019t aware of until I set my baby room up )\n\n\nI tried to be very cautious about this topic with her since I knew how painful it can be at times. Michael and I accommodated her a lot during those times. I let her stay in our house when her husband kicked her out since he has alcohol issues. I tried to buy her things to cheer her up,Michael even offer her husband a job but they denied because \u201cit don\u2019t pay enough\u201d etc \n\nThe first time  Joy made me uncomfortable was when she arrived to my house once with her toddler and saw my unborn baby nursery at that time. She then revealed that she had a miscarriage and that it was insensitive of me to do those things whilst she going through grief. I apologised and tried to change the subject. Then she asked me to not post anything about my son on social media and asked me to not have baby shower because we can\u2019t be that cruel to do such thing when her family going through a grief. I told her that she has nothing to worry about since my husband and I were not planning to do baby shower to begin with.\n\nSecond time when disaster happened is when I took Joy and her four kids in because she had an argument with her husband. Result : her kids destroyed my baby room , ruined walls , end up breaking crib and baby swing . And end up painting most of my baby clothes. My step sister only said \u201cthey just kids being kids\u201d\n\nFast forward when my baby was born Michael bought me Mercedes as a thank you for giving birth to his son . Of course I was happy about it and shared the news of my son being born to my insta ,oh man ,I didn\u2019t knew what was coming.\n\nJoy bomb me with a messages saying that I\u2019m rubbing in her face that I gave birth to a baby whilst she couldn\u2019t . And how now I\u2019m rubbing in her face that me and Michael living in luxury whilst she and her family is struggling. She said if I had 100k$ to spare for car I should have instead spend on buying them a new place to stay since they fed up with renting places . She also mentioned that she wouldn\u2019t have miscarriages if I helped her more financially instead of buying my unborn child unnecessarily shit \n\nFor some reason whether it was my hormones or something but I end up telling her that her kids it\u2019s not my responsibility and that her miscarriage was a sad thing but she has no right to make me feel like it was my fault .\n\nSo AITA for saying that her miscarriage is not my responsibility and being insensitive about it?", "created_utc": 1670870837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk7ljz/aita_for_telling_to_my_step_sister_that_her/", "score": 124, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'd be too afraid that she or the children would be do or say something awful to the baby.", "misspelling stuff?", "Hi ,sorry is my first time in this platform and I wanted to make it as short as possible to make it understandable. By expensive staff for unborn I meant that since it was long waited baby we bought many things in advance such as clothes,toys, shoes and pram mostly from expensive brands too but it\u2019s not exactly relevant I think . Idk if I worded that right I was trying to get my thoughts out , but I just meant that we went beyond what most people do I think . I\u2019m not sure if I answered your question right tho", "It\u2019s probably household chores, setting up nursery, and buying baby items.", "Hello. Thank you for your reply it means a lot to hear your feedback for my situation. Yes,I agree that I should have handled things better and that I should have said it in different way than what I did. I truly regret it especially since I know how hard miscarriages can affect someone . And I don\u2019t think I exploded necessarily because I never really was mad at her because I knew that she was going through some rough times so I never really had any bad feelings piled up . I might have been hurt by what her kids did but I try to think of it as just accident. But i do believe that words can be harsh and that I probably will apologise for how I handle things but at the same time after giving birth to my son I definitely need to set a boundaries and be a good mom rather than a good relative I guess .", "Actually it appears to have costed her a room and clothes etc", "Does that mean she should hide the kid forever to be kind to the sister? Is the kid allowed to come to family events or better leave it at home to be kind to the sister?", "And they trashed her nursery. Baby stuff is expensive. I\u2019m sure she put a lot of time and effort into it. I know we did.", "Ditto", "Stop putting her first. She has 4 kids. While i will never invalidate the pain of miscarriage, she is absolutely using it as a loophole, and shes purposely using it to persuade you. \n\nYou feel bad for her, cant imgaine what she's going through. Thats what she wants. Shes using her 'grief' to take advantage of your kindess. And to mentally beat you down, because it feels good to her. \n\nIm sorry Op, but stop being so kind to her. Stop helping her, stop letting them over. Its obvious SHE let her and her kids live with a dangerous alcoholic. SHE is choosing to stay and not change her life for the better. SHE is choosing to make you feel guilty becaus she had a hardship. \n\nWell what about you? You literally were told you couldnt announce or really even celebrate your own kid, becaue she decided No. Thats not fair. Good family, and healthy friends DONT treat people they love the way she does. \n\nI dont care if she was your identical twin. Step sister or not, she doesnt get the right to treat people like walking matts. \n\nQuestion; yiur best friend came sobbing to you, and told you she had done to her, what step sis has done to you. Saying 'dnt have a shower' cuz grief, the broken nursery,nthe verbal jabs and trying to control another adult persons life choices. \n\nIf yout best friend came crying that happened to her, what would you tell that friend? Think with that perspective. You abd your kiddo doesnt deserve to have then around. Good luck op", "Definitely not the AH. You should not have to apologize for having have a child which, if your sister was mature, she would be celebrating with you. Further, you don\u2019t have to go apologize for your husband choosing to spoil you with the Mercedes of your dreams. Someone said earlier she wants your life. She does and she\u2019s going to make you as miserable as she possibly can because she doesn\u2019t have it. Tend to agree it\u2019s may be time to call no contact because that destruction of that baby room was deliberate and I would be very concerned about my child around her children in around her if they would destroy that baby\u2019s room.", "oh jesus christ THAT would make a lot of sense, lol", "Well that other commenter had convinced me you just misspelled \"stuff\" but now you're doubling-down on \"staff\" so I do not know **_WHAT_** to think any more...", "Don't apologize.  Offer clarity on your stance, but don't weaponize her anymore than she already has been.", "You being pregnant & recently delivering are making your hormones & emotions run high too. \n\nCongratulations on your baby! Your kids are your #1 priority and you should be able to be excited.  \n\nHonestly it sounds like Joy needs therapy - she's grieving a miscarriage, she may still be dealing with hormonal issues, AND she has a very unhappy home life with her husband.  It's not your job to fix her life, she sounds like she's dealing with a LOT.", "I mean, bad parenting cost her that for sure.", "[deleted]", "Something tells me she told her kids to do it", "OP should remind Joy that she's damn lucky she didn't send her a bill for all the destroyed items, this sounds like something OP would have been able to take legal proceedings over.", "Sorry I meant stuff , I didn\u2019t realise that autocorrect was on . But yes I meant stuff my bad for not double checking before pressing send \ud83d\ude05", "Or maybe she should have just admitted that of course it is somehow her fault that the stepsister miscarried and give her the Mercedes? Kindness all around. Also she did not say it is not her problem, she said it is not her fault, which every sane person would agree with.", "Yah my first thought too"]}
