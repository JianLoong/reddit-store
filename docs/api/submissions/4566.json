After years of trying I finally was able to have a child on my own.

But for some reasons that  annoyed my step sister Joy [30F] a lot , she has four kids on her own and had a miscarriage (which I wasn\u2019t aware of until I set my baby room up )\n\n\nI tried to be very cautious about this topic with her since I knew how painful it can be at times. Michael and I accommodated her a lot during those times. I let her stay in our house when her husband kicked her out since he has alcohol issues. I tried to buy her things to cheer her up,Michael even offer her husband a job but they denied because \u201cit don\u2019t pay enough\u201d etc \n\nThe first time  Joy made me uncomfortable was when she arrived to my house once with her toddler and saw my unborn baby nursery at that time. She then revealed that she had a miscarriage and that it was insensitive of me to do those things whilst she going through grief. I apologised and tried to change the subject. Then she asked me to not post anything about my son on social media and asked me to not have baby shower because we can\u2019t be that cruel to do such thing when her family going through a grief. I told her that she has nothing to worry about since my husband and I were not planning to do baby shower to begin with.\n\nSecond time when disaster happened is when I took Joy and her four kids in because she had an argument with her husband. Result : her kids destroyed my baby room , ruined walls , end up breaking crib and baby swing . And end up painting most of my baby clothes. My step sister only said \u201cthey just kids being kids\u201d\n\nFast forward when my baby was born Michael bought me Mercedes as a thank you for giving birth to his son . Of course I was happy about it and shared the news of my son being born to my insta ,oh man ,I didn\u2019t knew what was coming.\n\nJoy bomb me with a messages saying that I\u2019m rubbing in her face that I gave birth to a baby whilst she couldn\u2019t . And how now I\u2019m rubbing in her face that me and Michael living in luxury whilst she and her family is struggling. She said if I had 100k$ to spare for car I should have instead spend on buying them a new place to stay since they fed up with renting places . She also mentioned that she wouldn\u2019t have miscarriages if I helped her more financially instead of buying my unborn child unnecessarily shit \n\nFor some reason whether it was my hormones or something but I end up telling her that her kids it\u2019s not my responsibility and that her miscarriage was a sad thing but she has no right to make me feel like it was my fault .\n\nSo AITA for saying that her miscarriage is not my responsibility and being insensitive about it?", "created_utc": 1670870837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk7ljz/aita_for_telling_to_my_step_sister_that_her/", "score": 328, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Idk if I worded that right I was trying to get my thoughts out , but I just meant that we went beyond what most people do I think . I\u2019m not sure if I answered your question right tho", "It\u2019s probably household chores, setting up nursery, and buying baby items.", "Hello. Thank you for your reply it means a lot to hear your feedback for my situation. Yes,I agree that I should have handled things better and that I should have said it in different way than what I did. I truly regret it especially since I know how hard miscarriages can affect someone . And I don\u2019t think I exploded necessarily because I never really was mad at her because I knew that she was going through some rough times so I never really had any bad feelings piled up . I might have been hurt by what her kids did but I try to think of it as just accident. But i do believe that words can be harsh and that I probably will apologise for how I handle things but at the same time after giving birth to my son I definitely need to set a boundaries and be a good mom rather than a good relative I guess .", "Actually it appears to have costed her a room and clothes etc", "Does that mean she should hide the kid forever to be kind to the sister? Is the kid allowed to come to family events or better leave it at home to be kind to the sister?", "And they trashed her nursery. Baby stuff is expensive. I\u2019m sure she put a lot of time and effort into it. I know we did.", "Ditto", "Stop putting her first. She has 4 kids. While i will never invalidate the pain of miscarriage, she is absolutely using it as a loophole, and shes purposely using it to persuade you. \n\nYou feel bad for her, cant imgaine what she's going through. Thats what she wants. Shes using her 'grief' to take advantage of your kindess. And to mentally beat you down, because it feels good to her. \n\nIm sorry Op, but stop being so kind to her. Stop helping her, stop letting them over. Its obvious SHE let her and her kids live with a dangerous alcoholic. SHE is choosing to stay and not change her life for the better. SHE is choosing to make you feel guilty becaus she had a hardship. \n\nWell what about you? You literally were told you couldnt announce or really even celebrate your own kid, becaue she decided No. Thats not fair. Good family, and healthy friends DONT treat people they love the way she does. \n\nI dont care if she was your identical twin. Step sister or not, she doesnt get the right to treat people like walking matts. \n\nQuestion; yiur best friend came sobbing to you, and told you she had done to her, what step sis has done to you. Saying 'dnt have a shower' cuz grief, the broken nursery,nthe verbal jabs and trying to control another adult persons life choices. \n\nIf yout best friend came crying that happened to her, what would you tell that friend? Think with that perspective. You abd your kiddo doesnt deserve to have then around. Good luck op", "Definitely not the AH. You should not have to apologize for having have a child which, if your sister was mature, she would be celebrating with you. Further, you don\u2019t have to go apologize for your husband choosing to spoil you with the Mercedes of your dreams. Someone said earlier she wants your life. She does and she\u2019s going to make you as miserable as she possibly can because she doesn\u2019t have it. Tend to agree it\u2019s may be time to call no contact because that destruction of that baby room was deliberate and I would be very concerned about my child around her children in around her if they would destroy that baby\u2019s room.", "oh jesus christ THAT would make a lot of sense, lol", "Well that other commenter had convinced me you just misspelled \"stuff\" but now you're doubling-down on \"staff\" so I do not know **_WHAT_** to think any more...", "Don't apologize.  Offer clarity on your stance, but don't weaponize her anymore than she already has been.", "You being pregnant & recently delivering are making your hormones & emotions run high too. \n\nCongratulations on your baby! Your kids are your #1 priority and you should be able to be excited.  \n\nHonestly it sounds like Joy needs therapy - she's grieving a miscarriage, she may still be dealing with hormonal issues, AND she has a very unhappy home life with her husband.  It's not your job to fix her life, she sounds like she's dealing with a LOT.", "I mean, bad parenting cost her that for sure.", "[deleted]", "Something tells me she told her kids to do it", "OP should remind Joy that she's damn lucky she didn't send her a bill for all the destroyed items, this sounds like something OP would have been able to take legal proceedings over.", "Sorry I meant stuff , I didn\u2019t realise that autocorrect was on . But yes I meant stuff my bad for not double checking before pressing send \ud83d\ude05", "Or maybe she should have just admitted that of course it is somehow her fault that the stepsister miscarried and give her the Mercedes? Kindness all around. Also she did not say it is not her problem, she said it is not her fault, which every sane person would agree with.", "Yah my first thought too", "NTA\n\nThis is insane. Miscarriage is horrible, and you should be sensitive to her grief. but that does not mean you cannot have a nursery in your own home, a baby shower if you wanted one, or acknowledge your sons birth when he arrived.\n\nYou struggled with infertility for years while she had 4 children. Did you ever ask her to hide her kids while you were struggling? I doubt it.\n\nShe sounds frankly unhinged.\n\nCongrats on the baby", "NTA. Cut this manipulative witch out of your life. She \u201callowed\u201d her kids to destroy your baby\u2019s room and belongings simply because she\u2019s jealous.  You giving her money would do nothing to help her not have another miscarriage. You do not owe her money for a home, especially since she insists on staying with an alcoholic who often tosses her and the kids out of their home.", "NTA\n\nSomething has gone terribly wrong with your step sister though. Maybe it's living with an alcoholic, struggling financially or having a bunch of stressed out kids... More than money, she needs therapy. It's horrible that she tried to guilt-tripped you into not sharing that you had a baby (not to mention destroying your property). I know it's tough, but are all the people in the world supposed to stop having kids, just because she had a miscariage?", "NTA. What a miserable and ungrateful person.\nJust extend her some grace by letting her know you\u2019re shutting her out of your life while she figures her stuff out.", "So NTA. \n\nCongratulations to you and your husband on your baby! You guys have every right to post, and celebrate especially after not being able to have one for long. \n\nI am extremely sympathetic to your step sister having a miscarriage as that is not something easy to go through, and I feel so bad for her kids who were expecting a sibling. But, for her to ask you to not have a baby shower - to let her kids destroy your baby nursery, - and to berate you for publicly posting on social media (which wasn\u2019t even targeted at her) about a new car and your child is a bit to much. I understand her grieving the loss of her child, but that loss shouldn\u2019t prevent you from celebrating a huge milestone. You have been more then accommodating to her situation. But, you can\u2019t continue to do so. Eventually, she is going to have to find a way to move on from her grief and allow herself to push forward for herself and her kids.", "NTA. I think you\u2019ve done what you can to be respectful and sensitive to her miscarriage situation, but she appears to have taken this too far that you owe her due to her unfortunate situation. \n\nShe\u2019s also taking social media announcements as personal attacks on her but you are not to blame. If she found these to be too much, she could hide your posts or unfriend.", "NTA\n\nJFC stop fucking associating with this clearly insane person!", "NTAH. She needs to get her jealousy green eyed monster under control before her family goes no contact. Just sayin\u2026", "She is extremely jealous of you.  Apparently she is competing.  She has had children.  Many women experience a miscarriage.  Your first pregnancy in no way competes with her.  \n\nHer kids ruined your nursery because she let them.  \nYou owe her nothing and her deep resentment of you is irrational and can\u2019t be fixed by you.  \n\nIf you must interact with her be blunt and no \nnonsense.  Try to grow distance between your life and hers.  Your child does not need relatives who are toxic (neither do you).", "Joy is toxic, illogical and entitled. She has \u201cweaponised\u201d her miscarriage to allow her to behave in an unacceptable antisocial way. It\u2019s not insensitive of you to prepare for the arrival of your own child in your own home. You are perfectly entitled to celebrate your happiness. \nShe already has 4 badly behaved kids that she can not afford by the sound of it. She has a shitty marriage. \nShe is unhappy and jealous and you had been incredibly patient with her. NTA.", "NTA \n\nHoly crap! You have been way too nice to her so that now feels entitled to you buying them a $100k home!\n\nWhat?\n\nShe has 4 kids and suffered a miscarriage and expects you, who has suffered infertility for years, to celebrate nothing as it\u2019s all about her. \n\nGeez Louise! She is an entitled one!\n\nYou need to create some separation from her. Even under the guise that she needs to grieve and you need to bond and enjoy your baby! She is one entitled toxic person.", "NTA\n\nThere is no reason for her to be acting like that, you are allowed to celebrate having a child even if someone else cannot. But also she has 4 other kids? I understand that a miscarriage is going to be sad despite having 4 kids. Its just crazy for her to say you're rubbing it in her face that she can't have a baby when she literally already has children....and this is your first.", "NTA. I've had a miscarriage and stillborn and can't imagine taking my grief out on someone else.", "NTA. At all. You have a right to celebrate the birth of your child.", "NTA\n\nI'd block her on social media, and distance yourself from her.  She probably told her kids to trash your baby's room.  She is jealous, entitled and not stable.  Not someone I'd want around my child.  There is only so much you can do to help someone as they say don't light yourself on fire to keep others warm", "NTA sure a miscarriage is traumatic but she has 4 kids already so not really a big deal. You deserve to be able to enjoy your life and be happy not to be walking on eggshells because step sis is dramatic and can\u2019t be happy for anyone but herself.", "NTA\n\nShe sounds quite manipulative.  Ignore her.", "I'm going with ESH. Step sis for obvious reasons but I vote you too just because of how much of a doormat you are.", "NTA. Her life, her choices. By the sounds of it she can\u2019t offer the four kids she already has a stable home.  She wants more and thinks you should fund her life!?  Time to go NC tbh.", "NTA.  Wow, Joy is a piece of work!  I get that a miscarriage is devastating and she has every right to grieve.  But she has 4 children already.  It's not like you were both on your first pregnancies.  I think she is jealous of your financial situation and more than likely jealous of the attention you and baby will be getting from family.  It sounds like she is going through a tough time, but that does not give her the right to allow her kids to trash your nursery or to make you keep the birth of your child quiet.  You are NTA.", "Your sister is exceedingly jealous of your life. I\u2019ve got the feeling that she encouraged her children to trash your baby room. Her behaviour all around is entitled and just honestly gross. You and your husband do not owe her anything. If she can\u2019t be pleasant you really don\u2019t need to have contact with her and you don\u2019t need to be doing anything to spare her feelings. She\u2019s just using her miscarriage as an excuse to be a b*tch. It\u2019s not about the miscarriage. It\u2019s about her wanting what you have. Take some time away from her for awhile. See how much better you feel without her around.", "Nta she is jealous n delusional. U need to be no contact with her or else when your baby grow up, she will say more toxic things to your baby and ruin his/her mental health. Also, don\u2019t take her or her kids in your house anymore- they don\u2019t respect your property. Don\u2019t be surprised if she try to steal things from you in your future and that include ur SO and money", "She\u2019s a b- she already has 4 kids and you could barely have one. WTF is wrong with her? NTA", "She has 4 kids that she can't afford. She's got no place begrudging OP of one much-wanted, beloved baby. She's a nasty hater. OP, get her out of your life. You're NTA, she is.", "I\u2019m sorry the moment her kids destroyed the room (which she absolutely coached them to do) that was the end of her mourning period in terms of your life. I can\u2019t have kids either but I don\u2019t get to control other peoples social media and whatnot just bc I can\u2019t move on. \n\nNTA", "NTA for shutting your sister down, but did you seriously post about a $100k car as a gift for giving birth?  That's really obscene.  Keep it to yourself.  Posting that the baby came is one thing, but posting about the car is basically screaming \"WE'RE RICH AND WE WANT EVERYBODY TO KNOW IT\"  to everyone in your network.  Not a good look.", "If she can't afford the children she has and is in an unstable relationship, she should NOT be having more children. Stop helping her, she's just going to try and drain all your resources while bringing you down. You don't need that energy around you while celebrating being a new mom.\n\nNTA.", "Time to block her on your social media, too.", "> just realize you now have a child to protect and your stepsister and her children cannot be trusted in your home, or around your child.\n\nThat was a thought that occurred to me. The nursery room damage was concerning.", "In fact OP give her your baby it\u2019s only fair.", "Having kids was the one thing your SS had that you didn\u2019t have. Now that you have one she has nothing to help her feel better about her life. I don\u2019t see this getting any better. \n\n\n\nCongratulations OP! Don\u2019t feel bad celebrating and shouting it from the roof tops. \n\n\nAnd yes I agree with others that your SS told her kids to ruin your nursery. When you start to feel bad remember that!", "DON'T FING APOLOGISE TO HER!!! She is weaponising her miscarriage because she knows you has been through it and would be extra sympathetic to her.\n\nYes, she is in a difficult situation due to her husband but isn't your fault neither it's on you to solve all her problems with money. You need to put yourself and your baby first. Go low contact with her for the time being and for the love of God don't let your baby alone with her or her kids.", "I think sis let the kids do it on purpose because she's jealous.  NTA congratulations, enjoy your family & your life that you & husband work hard to achieve. Go NC with sis.", "lol", "And probably egged them on the whole to make sure they trashed the room. That isn't kids being kids, that's malicious", "I agree, this was oddly specific that one room out of the entire house was \"destroyed.\" I would not be letting that SS or her kids back into my house after that.", "Yeah exactly. Why would they get paint on the baby clothes? That was 100% coached and that is when all sensitivity should\u2019ve gone out the window for her loss", "I had the same thought. All of this stuff had to cost a lot of money both individually and collectively; the simple fact is that preparing for a baby is never cheap.\n\nIt's really something how bold Joy is. She either knows she's made OP believe she genuinely deserves no consequences for her actions and wishes, or OP has been way too kind to her in the past as is. Either way, it's sad to see people get taken advantage of like this."]}
