After years of trying I finally was able to have a child on my own. I struggled to get pregnant several years but luckily,I had my husband Michael by my side to support.\n\nI was lucky tho,in a sense of Michael works in extreme well paid job so we could afford expensive stuff for an unborn baby. But for some reasons that  annoyed my step sister Joy [30F] a lot , she has four kids on her own and had a miscarriage (which I wasn\u2019t aware of until I set my baby room up )\n\n\nI tried to be very cautious about this topic with her since I knew how painful it can be at times. Michael and I accommodated her a lot during those times. I let her stay in our house when her husband kicked her out since he has alcohol issues. I tried to buy her things to cheer her up,Michael even offer her husband a job but they denied because \u201cit don\u2019t pay enough\u201d etc \n\nThe first time  Joy made me uncomfortable was when she arrived to my house once with her toddler and saw my unborn baby nursery at that time. She then revealed that she had a miscarriage and that it was insensitive of me to do those things whilst she going through grief. I apologised and tried to change the subject. Then she asked me to not post anything about my son on social media and asked me to not have baby shower because we can\u2019t be that cruel to do such thing when her family going through a grief. I told her that she has nothing to worry about since my husband and I were not planning to do baby shower to begin with.\n\nSecond time when disaster happened is when I took Joy and her four kids in because she had an argument with her husband. Result : her kids destroyed my baby room , ruined walls , end up breaking crib and baby swing . And end up painting most of my baby clothes. My step sister only said \u201cthey just kids being kids\u201d\n\nFast forward when my baby was born Michael bought me Mercedes as a thank you for giving birth to his son . Of course I was happy about it and shared the news of my son being born to my insta ,oh man ,I didn\u2019t knew what was coming.\n\nJoy bomb me with a messages saying that I\u2019m rubbing in her face that I gave birth to a baby whilst she couldn\u2019t . And how now I\u2019m rubbing in her face that me and Michael living in luxury whilst she and her family is struggling. She said if I had 100k$ to spare for car I should have instead spend on buying them a new place to stay since they fed up with renting places . She also mentioned that she wouldn\u2019t have miscarriages if I helped her more financially instead of buying my unborn child unnecessarily shit \n\nFor some reason whether it was my hormones or something but I end up telling her that her kids it\u2019s not my responsibility and that her miscarriage was a sad thing but she has no right to make me feel like it was my fault .\n\nSo AITA for saying that her miscarriage is not my responsibility and being insensitive about it?", "created_utc": 1670870837, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zk7ljz/aita_for_telling_to_my_step_sister_that_her/", "score": 2119, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

And I don\u2019t think I exploded necessarily because I never really was mad at her because I knew that she was going through some rough times so I never really had any bad feelings piled up . I might have been hurt by what her kids did but I try to think of it as just accident.

Fast forward many years and they blew up the relationship anyway over care of my nan and then later uncle who had a stroke. My aunt convinced everyone she should take over all responsibility then took control of $ and the way she 'cared' for my nan & uncle is a whole other post worth of grief and anger.

No one knew what do to do about my aunt. Years later, my mum came to terms with the idea that she had a personality disorder, and sociopath type tendencies and cut her off.

My husband got me car as thank you gift and I know it might sound silly or even weird but I wanted that car for longest time but couldn\u2019t justify the price for it since those cars are expensive . So when my husband gifted it to me as a \u201cthank you\u201d gift I was grateful for many reasons.

I helped Joy with taking care of her kids like getting them to hospital and dropping them on daycare and so on.

But then when many people told me that all seems suspicious I kinda started wondering why out of all rooms it was my babies room that was destroyed. If anything living room should have been a first victim since I have more objects there than I had at nursery at that time .
