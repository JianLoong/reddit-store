Cleaning kennels, scooping the yard, etc.\n\nWasn\u2019t allowed to go out with friends, had to work. Given a work list during the day on summer break, then to the farm in the evening.

Your husband is willing to pay him $100/week for this time. That comes to about $2.80/hour. Depending on the minimum wage where you are, your son could probably earn that much in a single shift (maybe 2 shifts) at a proper job.\n\nYou seem willing to acknowledge (in part) the ways in which your parentification of your oldest harmed him during the early yeara, but you are DEEPLY in denial about the harm your current day parentification is doing to your son and your relationships. His \"maturity\" is not maturity, it is survival skills he learned on the fly because you (his parents) weren't there to teach him or protect him from needing to learn yet.\n\nYou have already denied your oldest the first 17 years of his childhood. How willing are you to deny him the very last year before he becomes an adult? How comfortable are you with him leaving your home having NEVER been able to enjoy his childhood for what it should be (safe and relatively carefree)? Do you intend to demand his respect and compassion and generosity once he comes of age or do you plan to allow him to carry as little responsibility for his brothers as you did for him at that age?\n\nIn my opinion, older siblings should always be given some adequate compensation for supplementing the parental supervision of their siblings, even if it's not cash. To give him nothing and tell him that caring for your son 7 hours a day every day (excepting your weekends I hope) after school is HIS JOB is unacceptable.\n\nI want to try to soften how harsh everything I'm saying is by acknowledging you and your husband are in a tough place. You're working hard to financially support your family, and you are not able to be present in the way you want. That's really hard emotionally, and it must hurt to accept that the consequences of this thing - that is largely outside of your control - are hurting your kids. But they are hurting your kids. Your oldest deserves to have a life that is not dedicated to helping you raise his brother. He deserves to have his own hobbies, dreams, responsibilities, and joys outside of your family's demands on his time. The care system you have organized is extreme and unsustainable. You cannot continue demanding your oldest commit 14 hours minimum per day out of his 24 (only 16 wakeful hours! You are leaving him a measly TWO HOURS A DAY to do anything but school or help raise his brother! Is he even able to stay on top of his homework? His health? My god when does this kid get ANY time for himself when he isn't already exhausted???) to obligations he has to other people. You - an adult-  come home exhausted after every 9hour shift you work? You are coming home to relieve a SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD CHILD who has just finished a 14 hour shift. That is insane. For the love of your children PLEASE find another way to provide care/supervision to your youngest. Even if he still needs to provide care sometimes, he simply cannot keep being reaponsible for every day you work. You are destroying your son's mental health.
