I also get along well with my husband\u2019s friend\u2019s wife, although we are not super close.\n\nI was looking so forward to this vacation, but when we got down there, the girls were acting strange. I tried making conversation with both of them to which they would politely reply, but wouldn\u2019t do anything to carry the conversation and obviously weren\u2019t interested in talking. Throughout the week I suggested fun things for us to do to which they declined and they kept leaving the beach early to go in and sit on the couch on their phones, or went to bed super early and didn\u2019t want to do anything fun. One night we did end up going to the pier to fish, but of course I was the only girl that rented a rod along with the guys because I wanted to fish instead of just watching the men fish. Mid-way through the week, I made the decision that I would stop making an effort to hangout with people who obviously didn\u2019t want to hangout with me, and I started doing whatever the guys were doing (I wouldn\u2019t go in early from the beach, stayed up late drinking, etc). This made me feel like a major PICK-ME girl which I am most definitely NOT, but i could tell that the girls were even more bothered that I decided to do things with the guys when they didn\u2019t want to do anything. \n\nShould I have just been easier and went along with the girls stuff, even though they didn\u2019t want to do anything??

You're looking at this wrong. \n\nThree couples went on vacation together - one group of people. Two of the women don't feel like participating with THE GROUP. That's on them, not on another person in the group who just happens to be the same gender. You had no obligation to partner with them and do different things from the guys, which I find weird anyway. Who wants to go on vacation with their spouse and then not spend time with them?", "NTA. Dividing vacation activities by gender is stupid. No better than those parties where the women are in the kitchen cooking and the men are watching sports.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have \u2018wedding tackle\u2019 in your pants to be able to handle fishing tackle. Do what you want. Have fun your way.", "NTA you\u2019re not a pick me for enjoying your vacation, sounds like you just had a good time. Dont feel guilty for freeing yourself from other peoples bad vibes", "NTA continue to be polite, but it\u2019s your vacation too! Don\u2019t make enemies out of it but no reason to not do what you enjoy most of the options", "NTA\n\nYou don't owe those women anything, especially if they show zero interest in doing anything with you. That's their problem.", "You just went with whatever seemed the most fun to you.\n\nI feel like it's easy to bond with most girls on a superficial level and you did that, but for more you all didn't have the same vibe and that just happens. NAH", "NTA - You tried, they sound lame. Make the most of your vacation, the point of a vacation is to have fun. Maybe they'd rather just relax, and that's fine for them, but if that's not your bag, you're not obligated to sit around with them. If you're looking to get more out of your holiday and do more things, I don't see a problem with you sticking with your husband and the other guys. No one is stopping them from joining, so they really have no right to be bothered.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry these ladies tried to ruin your vaca, they sound like major drags", "NTA\n\nBeing a PICK-ME girl isn't about doing things with guys. It's about pointing out that your a girl doing things that girls don't usually do and making that your entire personality. Sounds like from your writing here you were just doing things you enjoy doing with a group of people who also enjoy doing them. No harm in that. That's exactly what vacations are for", "NTA\n\nIt was your vacation. You spent money and you deserve to get your money\u2019s worth! They were clearly giving you the cold shoulder. And from their reactions, it seems they were upset their plan didn\u2019t work and your vacation was not ruined. You don\u2019t owe them anything and I\u2019m glad you did the 180 and started to do whatever you wanted!", "What did these girls expected to happen? Like, are they upset that you chose to have fun while they just sat around doing.... nothing? Hide in the hotel room? Why would anyone want to hang around people like that during a vacation, especially when they basically made no effort to do anything, and made it pretty clear they didn't really like you?\n\nNTA OP, these women are weird. I'm just trying to wrap my head around how they're rationalizing being upset at you for having fun on a vacation.", "NTA. And if anyone has questions tell them you dint go on vacation to get bored.. you went out to have fun. They either join in on the fun or sit quitely in a corner. What  are they jealous their lazy asses dint have as much fun?", "NTA.\n\nThis whole \u201cpick me girl\u201d thing is, honestly, just another thing that pits women against each other. It almost like calling another girl \u201cslut\u201d because she happens to not be as conservative as others. The earliest version of this crap is \u201ctomboy\u201d when a girl likes to play with the boys rather than the girls. \n\nCan\u2019t we all accept that women can have different interests?", "NTA\n\nAssuming you don't say things like \"I get along better with guys because girls are just so catty\" and that your decision to spend time with the guys was about being more interested in what they were doing rather than about wanting them to like you...that's not being a pick me.\n\nYou're allowed to do what you want on vacation and if the girls were not interested in joining you, that's on them!", "NTA. It\u2019s your holiday too, and you found a way to enjoy it. You also made an effort to be with the girls and it was unreciprocated. Your work there was done! Good for you for finding a way to enjoy your holiday.", "NTA, it's your vacation too, you should be able to enjoy it the way you want to.", "NTA and also not a pick-me as far as I can tell. Baseline you just wanted to do different activities and they got to do what they wanted and as did you.", "NTA \n\nThe objective of a vacation is to have fun. Do so how you want to.", "Don't let stereotypes society uses to control women determine your choices. You are your own person and can do what you want when you want.\n\nNTA.", "NTA i dont believe in separating activities by gender. If youre all there together and you wanna do something then do it with the people who are also doing it. Sucks that having fun with people who happen to all be men made you feel like a pick me, you were picking yourself man", "NTA. I'd definitely hang out with the guys too. The other two women don't seem very interesting and obviously don't want to talk or hang out doing fun activities with the group.", "NTA - the boys probably appreciated one of the ladies not being a major drag.", "You are most definitely an annoying PICK ME GIRL. The fact that you needed to point out that the other girls didn't fish but you did. Also you needed to say girl stuff? Sorry activities don't have genders. You can do whatever you want. You don't need to keep pointing it out that you didn't want to do \"girl things\" because what in the hell dose that even mean?  You just want people to tell you at that your are not a pick me girl.
