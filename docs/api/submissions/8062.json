If OP cannot afford financial assistance to their sister and niece then thats one thing but why mention seperately that the expenses of her sister are not her responsability. Of course OP is right they are not. Having said that given the gravity of the situation I would assume that there is more to their relationship for OP to feel so bluntly that its not their problem.

For me, whilst affordability is a clear cut NTA the rest of the post does not satisy me that OP is not being an AH somewhere in this dynamic. Of course it is entirely possible that I am wrong just like it is possible that you're wrong. That is why I have asked for more info. For example: How is Ops repationship with their sister? How close is she to her niece? How were the dynamics between family and OP and sister growing up? Is there resentment there for some reason? Did niece have insurance?

Could be that everyone else is giving something, making a sacrifice in their own life, cutting back somewhere to help sister and sick kid and OP is the only one not doing so?", "Also the way he referred to the kid: \"my sister's daughter\", not \"my niece\".\n\nEither this is made up, or something more is going on here", "It\u2019s distancing language. I love being able to claim MY nieces because I love them.", "Dude I would hate to be a part of your family.  They can not pay it's legal but it is an asshole thing to do.  She can say \"nope not paying\" and it would be fine as long as she doesn't want to hang out with her family.  I'm guessing it is the same with friends.  \n\nI'm sure you would let a kid drown if they were in the water saying \"I don't have to do anything, cause I don't want to get my clothes wet\" lol.", "NTA. How is everyone coming up with OP being \u201ccold?\u201d They just stated the facts. They have their own financial obligations and don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s their responsibility. Why does that make them cold? Mind you, I\u2019m a person who bends over backward to help financially, sometimes to my own detriment. Obviously we don\u2019t know all the details, but it\u2019s certainly their right to say no.", "NTA. Every time a family member calls me to attempt to guilt me into lending money to a family member who is in need I reply \u201cAre you sending them money too?\u201d Usually, it\u2019s a no or they\u2019ll respond with \u201cI sent $20.\u201d I match what they sent \u201cto help\u201d. I have two kids in college and a mortgage but because we planned for those expenses in the past it appears to them that I have expendable income and am asked to be responsible for their expenses too. I\u2019ve learned my lesson about lending money family after one of my siblings asked for an for an \u201cemergency loan\u201d which caused my kids to miss out on a school trip that I saved for. I asked them to pay me back within 3 months and they kept \u201cforgetting\u201d. I will never prioritize adults, even if they\u2019re family, over my kids again.", "If you can\u2019t help you can\u2019t help. But your tone is concerning. You sound a little bit like these people are strangers to you instead of your family. It sounds like you don\u2019t care at all that your \u201csisters daughter\u201d is ill or that your sister is struggling. Kind of feels like you want the internet to absolve of something that you don\u2019t feel bad about to begin with. Without knowing your finances NTA. But you\u2019re pretty a cold individual from your tone in this post.", "NTA \nIt isn\u2019t ur irresponsibility sorry to say and if you have your own financial issues that you need to worry about thats first before helping anyone else out \nif she really needs that she can go take out a loan", "NTA for this situation but might be TA as a person in general", "everyone keeps bring up OPs tone, because OP was cold, quick and straight to the point. instead of posting a 3000 word sob story lmao. \n\nNTA.", "YTA if you can\u2019t help and you\u2019re being rude about it and you\u2019re not showing love and care towards your niece.", "It sounds like OP is well off and expected to pay. The family is the Asshole in this situation. While the OP is being cold by distancing from the niece as though a niece isn't OP's responsibility, they could all pitch in together to make a difference.\n\nIt sounds like OP could cut some fancy dinners every once and a while to help out, but is being expected to totally pay no strings attached and that's a failing on the whole family rather than working together in pieces. Also many comments suggested all kinds of services to help, and it sounds like the sister might be capable of doing more if she's mad for her sibling not hanging out 50k or whatever with no effort.\n\nA lot of speculating, but that's how it reads to me. I think you're all the assholes and should make a human centipede to fix the problem.\n\nand save the goddamn kid.", "NTA.  That\u2019s why god created Medicaid.", "Why would her money problems become yours? If the rest of the family are upset then tell them to give her the money she wants.", "Yes, you would think it might say \"I wish I could help, but I just don't have the financial resources to do so\" then it might come off better.", "Generally no, outside of insurance coverage, if you are without or over, then it's straight out of pocket. They may not refuse care(although there are many treatments that they can indeed deny), but that builds up like you won't believe. You'll find lots of people here with staggering medical debt even with assistance and hospitals claiming to be non-profit on their taxes(with even the shortest emergencyroom visits billing for thousands), the government will never take full responsibility. All the Christian Nationalists who bolster the Republican party care about is forcing women to give birth, they don't give a crap about the childs health or care after it's been born which is why any actual attrmpt to fix the US's medical system fails miserably. Getting into somewhere like St. Jude's children hospital is the only hope for some.", "Wow.  Two assholes in one post!", "Technically NTA since it's your money but it's a medical emergency. It's not like they're leeching off of you. Family helps each other in tough times. Specially if one is able to do so. But maybe there's more reason why the OP doesn't help? Did your sister bully you as a child? Was she the golden child and you weren't? Do you not have enough money?? We need more context, op, because your reasoning isn't enough. You just come off as cold hearted right now tbh.\n\nI think you can come to a compromise tho if you do have the extra money. You can LEND her the money, put that into writing and make her pay it back when she's able to. That is, if you don't hate each other and you still treat each other like family.", "Just start a go fund me for them. People donate to the dumbest things, so hopefully you\u2019d get a ton of donations for a sick child.", "Your other family members are disappointed? Have they all offered to help? Are they giving money? Maybe if they did then you could chip in if you were able to.", "You mean your niece", "Your other family members are welcome to help. If you can\u2019t afford to help then don\u2019t. But you need to drop the attitude about how it\u2019s not your responsibility to take care of her expenses. It comes across judgemental and defensive and like you do not care about your niece and sister. ESH", "Nta, too many people think you need to break yourself for family. To many think family deserve all that you have and then some. What about the father of the child? There is child support and stuff. Why is the rest if the family shaming you? If they can't can't or not willing to help? Fuck them", "NTA. if you don't have the money either, it is what it is. Maybe instead of judging you your relatives can whip out their wallets instead.", "Your tone is cold, your reasons are slightly vague. I feel like there's more to this story. Without more context, YTA. Unless you are homeless, I'm sure you could at least help out your family a little bit. A small gesture is better than nothing. You don't sound homeless, you sound heartless.", "NTA", "NTA.", "Like everybody's broke, but most people could give $20 and say I'm sorry I can help out more. And maybe offer to pitch in with some chores since sick kids and doctor visits take a toll.\nHell, while not necessary or making much of a difference in budget, the dollar store probably has a small teddy bear for the kid and a bath bomb for the sister- OP could try to tell his sister to go have an evening to relax and he'd have a neice & uncle afternoon to give her a break. It could also be a casserole to freeze until a night after long doctors visits where they just want a warm meal with no effort. The thing is OP doesn't even seem to care or have any empathy. ANY indication of wishing you could help more goes a long way.\n\nLooking at this like as my family, I love my niece (who I also don't call my sister's daughter?) And would do whatever I could for her. If she had huge medical bills I would be finding overtime or side hustles or something to help out. GoFundMe's, set up a community event and get local businesses to donate stuff to raffle off, finding other ways to get medical bills reduced.\n\nOp isn't an AH for not paying all of a sick kids bills, or not going above and beyond for family they don't seem close with. But not having any compassion for people going through a terrible time is really shitty.", "So OP needs to suffer because of their sister poor decisions?", "See, that's one of the (many) reasons I was doing research into being autistic myself. I also cringe up when watching these kind of things, yet when a person tells me about something sad, no feeling comes up in me. I understand intellectually that it is sad and to show sympathy, but it's not the same as watching a movie for some reason. I happened to find a lot of autistic individuals talking about experiencing the same. So, can't both be true? I know there are many differences and no one size fits all with autism anyway."]}
