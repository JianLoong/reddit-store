If OP cannot afford financial assistance to their sister and niece then thats one thing but why mention seperately that the expenses of her sister are not her responsability. Of course OP is right they are not. Having said that given the gravity of the situation I would assume that there is more to their relationship for OP to feel so bluntly that its not their problem. I contend that a good sibling relationship, where OP could afford assistance, would not frame a their nieces sickness as bluntly as \"not their problem\". Again this is my interpretation and you can feel free to agree or disagree but not to invalidate. \n\n>My other family members are also disappointed in me and think I should have helped her out.\n\nThis is not abusive, or coercive, or attacking. Disappointed is a legitimate response under some circumstances. Therefore I asked for more INFO as it may be that OP has a deeply unreasonable family, in which case, fair enough again NTA. Or it could be that OPs relationship with their sister is strained for some reason we are not being told and that the families disappointment at OPs denying financial assistance when they can afford to help is seen as unreasonable in the context of a severely unwell child. In this case potentially YTA. \n\n>AITA for refusing to help my sister with her daughter's medical expenses?\n\nAs you can see the specific question pertains to how reasonable the denial of assistance is. For me, whilst affordability is a clear cut NTA the rest of the post does not satisy me that OP is not being an AH somewhere in this dynamic. Of course it is entirely possible that I am wrong just like it is possible that you're wrong. That is why I have asked for more info. For example: How is Ops repationship with their sister? How close is she to her niece? How were the dynamics between family and OP and sister growing up? Is there resentment there for some reason? Did niece have insurance?
