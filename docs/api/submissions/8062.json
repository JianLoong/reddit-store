And just because you can't help financially, can you offer your time to drive her to medical appointments? Make or pay for dinner so your sister's family doesn't have to deal with that?

There are other ways to help that can be valuable too.", "NTA\n\n> My other family members are also disappointed in me and think I should have helped her out.\n\nAre these same family members helping her out?  What part of \"I can't afford it\" is not clear to them?", "I remember a poster being in a similar position.

Cuz while you say (somewhat evasively, but okay) that you can't afford it, the tone of your post sounds like you just don't want to. And that makes a big difference here.\n\nAlso, any amount money helps here. You don't have to pay for it all, she's just asking if you can spare anything to help her out.", "NAH\n\nIf you can't afford to help, you can't afford it.  Period.\n\nBut I find it odd that no one in the entire family can/will contribute, and wonder if there's more going on (within the whole family) than just an inability to help financially.", "NTA\n\nUnless this is something you can easily afford and owe her.  Plenty of rich people would think nothing of dropping $200k on a new car for themselves but wouldn't give 2 cents to a family member in need even if that family member did a ton for them in the past.  And if that's you, you are the ahole.\n\nI also hope the disappointed family members are contributing something to your sister.", "NTA if you literally can\u2019t afford to help her out without putting yourself into debt. That\u2019s not fair on you. I understand that hers and the daughters life isn\u2019t fair atm but why aren\u2019t all these other judgmental family members helping out? And if they are, why are you expected to contribute as well?", "Soft NTA but I agree with the others that the tone of the post is off and something seems a little disconnected. Example, you called her your sisters daughter and not your niece. \n\nThis is always a hard one when people want/need financial help, are we talking about a few hundred dollars a month or thousands?", "NTA. The daughter is the responsibility of your sister and her ex (the kid's father).

How does a first world country do this to their citizens?", "So you must go into debt so that she and the rest of your family members don\u2019t have to?? Ya, NTA she should try and apply for loans and reach out to the child\u2019s father.", "May I ask for additional clarification? If you are financially not in a position to offer any sort of assistance then you can perhaps help your niece by doing a fund raiser? Or perhaps starting a go fund me?

Perhaps she could start a go fund me?", "This does not make you an arsehole if you do not have money to help her with. However, you should provide whatever help you can. I M not able to fathom the decision making here or your any previous episodes with her ... otherwise everyone helps their relatives especially near and dear ones... she is also a single mother.", "Soft AH hear me out before i get hella downvoted there is something off about the tone she is using like lack off empathy, and the fact she calls here in the post sister daughter and not niece make things suspicious + i feel like some informations have been left out BUT i could probably be very wrong as my judgement is based purely on instinct so if that's the case NTA and sorry ^^\".", "I always love ones like this. The other family members are jumpming on you for not helping, but I don't read that they are helping her either.

You aren't obligated to help her but I feel like more info is needed.\nIf your financial obligations are a Ferrari and your sister needs copays for her daughter's insulin, while still not obligated, I'd think you were kind of an asshole. \n\nYou don't have to offer money to be supportive.  Emotional support or helping her with errands while she's at the hospital, staying with your niece so she could work, all of that are ways you can be supportive. If she is still struggling financially there are agencies that can help her navigate the system.", "Erm...I can't say N T A because, as others have pointed out, your tone is kind of AHy. I'm not getting any sense of empathy.", "NTA She isn't entitled to your money. I hate it when people make poor life choices and expect someone who makes better choices to pick up their slack. You can't help her out when you need the money for your own needs. Encourage her to get a gofundme account and be sisterly by helping to promote it.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But you\u2019re not coming off as very nice either.  If you could help your niece that would be wonderful.  If you can\u2019t because it\u2019s financially not possible that\u2019s one thing. But saying no just because your niece isn\u2019t your responsibility isn\u2019t very kind of you. Homeless aren\u2019t my responsibility either.  The cold kids at school. Hungry kids.  Yet I set aside money every year to pay for kids lunches at school so they can eat and we buy coats every year after season to give out to the kids without them.

I assume all the other relatives are helping financially ?", "I don\u2019t think we could make a call until we knew exactly how much you are making or ballpark and if you have scary debt.

If you are on a moderate budget and your sister has always been reckless that\u2019s different than if you have 500k in assets and a steady job over 100-150k and your sister is a single mom doing her best. \n\nI\u2019d ask yourself if your family generally has good judgement(if they don\u2019t then disregard) then why are they taking your sisters side? Does anyone else in your family have money? Why are you being singled out?", "NTA. You're right. It's not your responsibility, and for the family who is criticizing your choice, tell them to open their pocket books and help her out.", "NTA for not being able to afford it.\n\nBut YTA for the \"not my responsibility\" bullshit. That's your family and you sound extremely cold hearted about the fact that your niece is ill.", "NTA - but if she cuts you off after this don\u2019t be surprised. \n\nMaybe a payment plan could help, but with signatures and a notary, it\u2019s is a sick child\u2026", "You seem like a very cold person.

If someone asked me multiple times for something, and I told them multiple times I couldn't afford to help out financially.\n\nMy tone might also be similar to OP's, I'd might be a bit \"over-it\" even if I felt sympathetic for the kid.", "Definitely see so many of these on here.\nI mean what sort of country denies medical treatment to children especially but in general", "Yes, agreed. If OP can't afford it, or would be destitute themselves if they did, then that's fair enough but there's a huge \"not my fault, not my responsibility\" tone to this post that makes me think OP thinks health is some sort factor of morals and not luck of the draw. Like it's the mum's fault the girl's sick.", "Perhaps he isn't close with the sister so would only be helping out of a sense of familial obligation? If it were my sister I'd be in the same boat.

The added line about it not being OP's responsibility to help bothers me. If I couldn't provide financial help, I certainly would offer to maybe drive them to the hospital, come sit with the niece to allow my sister to have a break, something. There must be something part of this missing. Enough so that I defer judgement.", "Agreed.

The problem is usually *the parents* who are too proud to accept what they deem \"a government handout/welfare\".  I used to work in healthcare, and we *constantly* had to fight with parents to get their kids signed up so we could treat them.  Most would eventually come around when they realized their families weren't going to help them pay for it or couldn't afford to help.", "Add in it's the mum's fault she has a child at all and is a single mum. OP comes off as super cold and there's a strong vibe of missing info. I get the feeling OP has the funds to help but doesn't want to afford it.

Especially for a child that has a serious and expensive medical condition, who he is directly related to? \n\nIf he can't afford it that's one thing but he just doesn't care. \n\nBut obviously he, and you, have zero empathy for other humans and their terrible situations.", "The poor life choice is not the daughter getting sick.

Everybody deserves healthcare.", "How do u even know that it was poor choices on the mom's part. Guy might have died, have been a dick, they might have lost their house in a fire, been fired cos at will employment is a horrible concept, be disabled in some way etc etc. Who knows! \n\nAlso, if someone made a bad choice and they fucked up, it does not automatically make them any less deserving of compassion or help.", "I feel like to get healthcare for all, we should start with healthcare for minors. It isn\u2019t possible to just switch all at once, the economy would collapse. \n\nIn my state, the first year of life is almost always covered by state insurance, unless the parents make over like 120k which is only about 20% of families. The income threshold is like 1/3 of that for insurance for kids and caretakers for the rest of the child\u2019s minor life. If we could start by increasing the income limit to the extra allotted income for that first year, that would be a start and not a large enough change all at once to collapse the system. The only problem is insurance companies are a huge employer over here\u2026.. that\u2019s a huge job loss.", "The sister needs to explore any assistance that might be available through the state or charitable organisations. Do you expect the other sister to neglect her own bills to help out? Should she make herself homeless to help out? She clearly can't afford to help so what do you want her to do?", "Other countries switched all at once. The NHS was established in one fell swoop."]}
