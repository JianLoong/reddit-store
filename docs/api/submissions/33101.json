It's not normal and people who say they'd be totally cool with it and that you're insecure are in the minority, have never actually experienced it, or they're trying to sound chill and new agey.\n\nAlso, I love animals and I have 4 cats (I've had 8 in my life) and let me tell you; The cat doesn't give a toss if it sees the ex or not. She's being selfish and needs to get over it.\n\nHowever, if banning the ex from seeing the cat is making your partner really upset you need to have a frank discussion with him about the whole situation. It's odd. \n\nNTA.", "NTA  Tell the BF to tell the EX the cat died.  Had it cremated and buried. See what happens", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s a not great movie called something like \u201cThe Right Kind of Wrong\u201d on one of the streaming services. The truest thing about the movie was the empathy shown for the cat/s and how the split of a couple tore up one partner so much because of the separation of the cats and how much one of them really loved and missed the other cat.\n\nImagine the cat was a child they shared. It\u2019s like that for a lot of people. \n\nYour poor bf. He just did something for you that hurt him and someone he loved and had a life with for five years. YTA.\n\nUnrelated: Song for a Cat Named Virtue (or maybe it\u2019s Ballad for a Cat Names Virtue) and also \u201cMurder or a Heart Attack\u201d\n\nlisten to those two songs.", "NTA, frankly his ex still wanting to come to his house and see him after being broken up for 2 years is strange to say the least. He kept the cat and it\u2019s unfortunate but she needs to move on, sure visiting the cat would be nice but your bf is in a relationship and expecting to go over to his house when he\u2019s there and his gf probably won\u2019t be is just inappropriate. \n\nAnd him crying about the whole thing is even weirder imo, who cries because their ex can\u2019t come over and see their cat? The whole thing is just weird and makes me feel like neither of them have completely moved on. She also has you blocked on everything for some reason so she clearly has an issue with you AND if she just wanted to see the cat she wouldn\u2019t have commented on not being able to see your boyfriend. He needs to cut the cord", "NTA - the fact the arrangement with this cat has been treated similarly to child visitation is insane. She needs to move on, and by the sounds of it, so does he. This goes beyond 'people pleasing'. His ex needs to stay where she is - in the past.", "NAH. But, you can\u2019t even handle an ex coming up in conversation? If you can\u2019t be with a person that\u2019s still friendly and on decent terms with their ex then you shouldn\u2019t be with him, because it sounds like that\u2019s the case here.", "YTA\n\nThe last time she asked was a year ago? If she was trying to get with your bf, she'd be in contact a lot more frequently than that.\n\nYou don't even want it to come up in conversation? You're sounding jealous and controlling. Stop making trouble for both of you and get over it.", "NTA because it's weird the ex has you blocked on everything. Why can she come and you guys meet and hang out with the cat, you're like a new bonus mom anyways, it makes sense to get to know you as well and you would be able to tell her a lot about the cat", "This feels sort of unclear. You feel that she wants to see your boyfriend more than the cat, but this seems to be a once-a-year thing? Or at least it\u2019s been a year since the last time she saw the cat? \n\nIf this was like, a really frequent and recurring thing, I would share your suspicion. But if it\u2019s been an entire year and she\u2019s only contacting about the cat\u2014unless I\u2019m mistaken\u2014then I don\u2019t think it has to do so much with your bf probably?\n\nEdit: I apologize to sound snarky at all. I just feel like a little more info would be helpful.\n\nI\u2019m not a pet owner so I can\u2019t speak to psychological attachment to a pet or anything. I honestly understand where you\u2019re coming from  and I actually more or less agree with you, but wondering if there\u2019s a chance that it\u2019s benign. Obviously you have the right to express your discomfort to your bf and discuss it.", "Why don\u2019t you handle all communication about the cat? If she wants to come by and see the cat then she can come on your terms. Guaranteed she will disappear when she knows he won\u2019t be around. She seems shady.", "Definitely NTA. It\u2019s not a child. ITS A CAT. She agreed to give it to him and the relationship has been ended for 2 years. She needs to stay in her lane and your BF needs to cut her off. She can get another cat.", "YTA it\u2019s about the cat, not your bf.", "YTA, stop being so insecure, it was her cat too, maybe she's attached to the cat who used to be hers.", "I'm gonna say NTA. i agree with your interpretation of her asking \"oh, I can't see you?\". I would bet she came over with the hopes your bf would show up. Losing a pet and a partner at the same time is rough, but after 2 years she needs to move on. It's weird.", "Yta. People form very strong bonds with cats and dogs and other animals to the point where they cry when they pass away. His ex clearly still has emotions for the cat, and if she was actually trying to get with him, she would be texting him a lot more than once a year, regardless of where she is in the world. The only sus thing is why she has you blocked on everything. It seems to me that there is a history between the two of you directly. Or it could be that she originally didn't want reminders of you and him together and then completely forgot she has you blocked. But have you interacted with her in person, and what is it like? I don't think she would have an issue contacting you for the cat if your bf tells her that he's unable to always coordinate it with her, and then gives her your number. Which BTW, she shouldn't have your number blocked unless you gave it to her at some point, which further makes me believe there is a bad history between the two of you.", "NTA. It's been over 2 years - she needs to move on.  And why is HE crying about... what, his ex feeling bad about a cat?  It's weird.  Either he needs therapy to deal with crushing anxiety/guilt/people-pleasing problems, he's actually upset about not being able to hang out with his ex, or he's trying to guilt you.\n\nDoes he usually cry about compulsive people-pleasing issues, or when he doesn't get what he wants?", "i just mean like i don\u2019t need her texting him and him  telling me that she reached out. i\u2019m kind to my exes, but i\u2019m not in communication with them", "OP should just piss outside the apartment door entrance.  Once that statement is made, cat can be seen by ex gf.", "she has me blocked on everything. or else this would be a great idea", "If it were about the cat she wouldn\u2019t have cared about not seeing him", "It\u2019s definitely about the bf", "i guess how i see it is that i loved the cat i had with my ex, but he\u2019s in a new relationship. and i don\u2019t feel it appropriate for me to ask him to still be in his life and see the cat. so it bothers me when my boyfriend\u2019s ex does it", "he is a people pleaser. and he cries because he doesn\u2019t want to hurt people, so he feels guilty saying no", "YTA, that\u2019s controlling and weird, date someone who\u2019s on worse terms with their exes if that\u2019s the weird hill you\u2019re going to die on.", "Explain it to your bf that you are taking over contacting her. If she truly is trying to see the cat she can unblock you and coordinate day/time. Do you know why she blocked you? If it\u2019s for no reason then that\u2019s a red flag.", "So have your bf's last message to her be that any communication from now on is going through you. Either she won't be willing to unblock you and gives up, or now you get to monitor her actions. Win-win.", "\u201cOh I can\u2019t see you?\u201d After it not being an issue for the last year is definitely an appropriate question. I read surprised at the change - not her wanting OPs bf anymore.", "No, it\u2019s really just about the cat. She showed up, without seeing bf, last December specifically for the cat. It is her cat too. OP is just jealous. Have BF leave again, so she can visit her cat.", "So you\u2019re jealous that she\u2019s seeing her cat bc you can\u2019t see yours?", "Yeah, he should probably get therapy for that.  Crying in response to serious emotional upset is natural, but if you can't say no to people without having a full weeping meltdown, that's not healthy or normal.", "She showed up for an opportunity to have unmonitored access to her exbf's apartment.", "I agree with this. It\u2019s once a year and they can do the same things as last year and have him not be home.\n\nPretty cruel and heartbreaking for ex and the cat.\n\nWhat\u2019s to be threatened by anyways?  You either trust your bf (no need to even think about that since he won\u2019t be home) or not.", "i see it sounds that way - but i am just trying to be respectful to others and have the same respect :(", "Oh, did she steal from them then? Napped the cat? Money missing? Place trashed? \n\nThe unmonitored access was the compromise proposed to her - this wasn\u2019t her idea. She\u2019s just trying to see her cat. If she had nefarious reasons, where were they last December?", "It\u2019s not about you though.  That\u2019s what you\u2019re not seeing.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate for all involved that you need to mark your territory for an hour a year like that.\n\nI hope whatever issues with your bf that are making you so insecure resolve themselves.", "Excuses just because your too cowardly to go see your ex cat doesn\u2019t mean you get to project. The cat was hers before it was yours I only wish the cat could tell you itself."]}
