It's not normal and people who say they'd be totally cool with it and that you're insecure are in the minority, have never actually experienced it, or they're trying to sound chill and new agey.\n\nAlso, I love animals and I have 4 cats (I've had 8 in my life) and let me tell you; The cat doesn't give a toss if it sees the ex or not. She's being selfish and needs to get over it.\n\nHowever, if banning the ex from seeing the cat is making your partner really upset you need to have a frank discussion with him about the whole situation. It's odd. \n\nNTA.", "NTA  Tell the BF to tell the EX the cat died.  Had it cremated and buried. See what happens", "YTA\n\nThere\u2019s a not great movie called something like \u201cThe Right Kind of Wrong\u201d on one of the streaming services. The truest thing about the movie was the empathy shown for the cat/s and how the split of a couple tore up one partner so much because of the separation of the cats and how much one of them really loved and missed the other cat.\n\nImagine the cat was a child they shared. It\u2019s like that for a lot of people. \n\nYour poor bf. He just did something for you that hurt him and someone he loved and had a life with for five years.", "NTA, frankly his ex still wanting to come to his house and see him after being broken up for 2 years is strange to say the least. He kept the cat and it\u2019s unfortunate but she needs to move on, sure visiting the cat would be nice but your bf is in a relationship and expecting to go over to his house when he\u2019s there and his gf probably won\u2019t be is just inappropriate. \n\nAnd him crying about the whole thing is even weirder imo, who cries because their ex can\u2019t come over and see their cat? The whole thing is just weird and makes me feel like neither of them have completely moved on. She also has you blocked on everything for some reason so she clearly has an issue with you AND if she just wanted to see the cat she wouldn\u2019t have commented on not being able to see your boyfriend. He needs to cut the cord", "NTA - the fact the arrangement with this cat has been treated similarly to child visitation is insane. She needs to move on, and by the sounds of it, so does he. This goes beyond 'people pleasing'. His ex needs to stay where she is - in the past.", "NAH. But, you can\u2019t even handle an ex coming up in conversation? If you can\u2019t be with a person that\u2019s still friendly and on decent terms with their ex then you shouldn\u2019t be with him, because it sounds like that\u2019s the case here.", "YTA\n\nThe last time she asked was a year ago? If she was trying to get with your bf, she'd be in contact a lot more frequently than that.\n\nYou don't even want it to come up in conversation? You're sounding jealous and controlling. Stop making trouble for both of you and get over it.", "NTA because it's weird the ex has you blocked on everything. Why can she come and you guys meet and hang out with the cat, you're like a new bonus mom anyways, it makes sense to get to know you as well and you would be able to tell her a lot about the cat", "This feels sort of unclear. You feel that she wants to see your boyfriend more than the cat, but this seems to be a once-a-year thing? Or at least it\u2019s been a year since the last time she saw the cat? \n\nIf this was like, a really frequent and recurring thing, I would share your suspicion. But if it\u2019s been an entire year and she\u2019s only contacting about the cat\u2014unless I\u2019m mistaken\u2014then I don\u2019t think it has to do so much with your bf probably?\n\nEdit: I apologize to sound snarky at all. I just feel like a little more info would be helpful.\n\nI\u2019m not a pet owner so I can\u2019t speak to psychological attachment to a pet or anything. I honestly understand where you\u2019re coming from  and I actually more or less agree with you, but wondering if there\u2019s a chance that it\u2019s benign. Obviously you have the right to express your discomfort to your bf and discuss it.", "Why don\u2019t you handle all communication about the cat? If she wants to come by and see the cat then she can come on your terms. Guaranteed she will disappear when she knows he won\u2019t be around. She seems shady.", "Definitely NTA. It\u2019s not a child. ITS A CAT. She agreed to give it to him and the relationship has been ended for 2 years. She needs to stay in her lane and your BF needs to cut her off. She can get another cat.", "YTA it\u2019s about the cat, not your bf.", "YTA, stop being so insecure, it was her cat too, maybe she's attached to the cat who used to be hers.", "I'm gonna say NTA. i agree with your interpretation of her asking \"oh, I can't see you?\". I would bet she came over with the hopes your bf would show up. Losing a pet and a partner at the same time is rough, but after 2 years she needs to move on. It's weird.", "Yta. People form very strong bonds with cats and dogs and other animals to the point where they cry when they pass away. His ex clearly still has emotions for the cat, and if she was actually trying to get with him, she would be texting him a lot more than once a year, regardless of where she is in the world. The only sus thing is why she has you blocked on everything. It seems to me that there is a history between the two of you directly. Or it could be that she originally didn't want reminders of you and him together and then completely forgot she has you blocked. But have you interacted with her in person, and what is it like? I don't think she would have an issue contacting you for the cat if your bf tells her that he's unable to always coordinate it with her, and then gives her your number. Which BTW, she shouldn't have your number blocked unless you gave it to her at some point, which further makes me believe there is a bad history between the two of you.", "NTA. It's been over 2 years - she needs to move on.  And why is HE crying about... what, his ex feeling bad about a cat?  It's weird.  Either he needs therapy to deal with crushing anxiety/guilt/people-pleasing problems, he's actually upset about not being able to hang out with his ex, or he's trying to guilt you.\n\nDoes he usually cry about compulsive people-pleasing issues, or when he doesn't get what he wants?", "i just mean like i don\u2019t need her texting him and him  telling me that she reached out. i\u2019m kind to my exes, but i\u2019m not in communication with them", "OP should just piss outside the apartment door entrance.  Once that statement is made, cat can be seen by ex gf.", "she has me blocked on everything. or else this would be a great idea", "If it were about the cat she wouldn\u2019t have cared about not seeing him", "It\u2019s definitely about the bf", "i guess how i see it is that i loved the cat i had with my ex, but he\u2019s in a new relationship. and i don\u2019t feel it appropriate for me to ask him to still be in his life and see the cat. so it bothers me when my boyfriend\u2019s ex does it", "he is a people pleaser. and he cries because he doesn\u2019t want to hurt people, so he feels guilty saying no", "YTA, that\u2019s controlling and weird, date someone who\u2019s on worse terms with their exes if that\u2019s the weird hill you\u2019re going to die on.", "Explain it to your bf that you are taking over contacting her. If she truly is trying to see the cat she can unblock you and coordinate day/time. Do you know why she blocked you? If it\u2019s for no reason then that\u2019s a red flag.", "So have your bf's last message to her be that any communication from now on is going through you. Either she won't be willing to unblock you and gives up, or now you get to monitor her actions. Win-win.", "\u201cOh I can\u2019t see you?\u201d After it not being an issue for the last year is definitely an appropriate question. I read surprised at the change - not her wanting OPs bf anymore.", "No, it\u2019s really just about the cat. She showed up, without seeing bf, last December specifically for the cat. It is her cat too. OP is just jealous. Have BF leave again, so she can visit her cat.", "So you\u2019re jealous that she\u2019s seeing her cat bc you can\u2019t see yours?", "Yeah, he should probably get therapy for that.  Crying in response to serious emotional upset is natural, but if you can't say no to people without having a full weeping meltdown, that's not healthy or normal.", "She showed up for an opportunity to have unmonitored access to her exbf's apartment.", "I agree with this. It\u2019s once a year and they can do the same things as last year and have him not be home.\n\nPretty cruel and heartbreaking for ex and the cat.\n\nWhat\u2019s to be threatened by anyways?  You either trust your bf (no need to even think about that since he won\u2019t be home) or not.", "i see it sounds that way - but i am just trying to be respectful to others and have the same respect :(", "Oh, did she steal from them then? Napped the cat? Money missing? Place trashed? \n\nThe unmonitored access was the compromise proposed to her - this wasn\u2019t her idea. She\u2019s just trying to see her cat. If she had nefarious reasons, where were they last December?", "It\u2019s not about you though.  That\u2019s what you\u2019re not seeing.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate for all involved that you need to mark your territory for an hour a year like that.\n\nI hope whatever issues with your bf that are making you so insecure resolve themselves.", "Excuses just because your too cowardly to go see your ex cat doesn\u2019t mean you get to project. The cat was hers before it was yours I only wish the cat could tell you itself.", "I spoke with an ex about our cat for a decade.  We both married and have lives.  We both just loved that damn cat", "NTA, but I wouldn't stay with a bf who cries over not getting to see his ex.", "> literally cried when he told her she couldn\u2019t see the cat this year because of how bad he felt.\n\nUhm, I'd leave this guy. You've stuck around for 2 years of cat custody???", "NTA. She's trying to worm her way back into his life.", "I not need to read, but yes. YTA. \n\nAnimals have special bonds with their owners, and vice versa. \n\nIf you\u2019re this insecure in your relationship maybe the cat isn\u2019t the problem?", "I get where you are coming from but YTA. Not everyone has such close emotional bonds and attachments with animals, but for those of us that do, it's like not being able to see your own child (not as bad obviously but a similar feeling). I allow my ex to visit our cats because I know he loves them and the cats miss him. When you get a pet, you commit to that animal for the rest of it's life and they bond to you like family. It doesn't necessarily mean there is any intention of trying to get back with him, but your right, it could be. But I'm inclined to agree with others who have noted that if she was really after him she would be in contact more often. If you feel this strongly about it, you may have underlying distrust in regards to your boyfriend. Is there anything he has done to give you the impression that he is entertaining this beyond a friendship level, or other situations? Or are you insecure in the relationship? She can try all she wants, but will only be successful if he allows her to be, and at that rate why be with him? He needs to maintain solid boundaries and if she crosses them then I would take issue but it doesn't sound like she has at this point.", "Slightly YTA - from your post I\u2019m getting the vibe you\u2019re convinced this is just about seeing your boyfriend. I didn\u2019t see any indication that you are willing to believe this could really be about the cat. Why did she block you? \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a one size fits all scenario when it comes to pets and breakups. People have very different attachments to individual animals and this one could have meant that much to her. \nIf this was all really an attempt to see your boyfriend, I don\u2019t think she would have shown up last year without him there. \n\nYou say your boyfriends a pushover but he\u2019s probably feeling like you\u2019re the one making this hard. If you can\u2019t show more maturity and creative problem solving in this situation it will likely have a very negative impact on your relationship. I know it\u2019s not a fun situation to be in but the important thing is how you handle these issues. If your man is worth being with, this woman seeing a cat she\u2019s bonded with once a year isn\u2019t a real threat.", "YTA\n\nI was really insecure when I first started seeing my bf because he was still friends with his ex.\n\nI\u2019m actually really good friends with her and I\u2019m so glad I got over my own insecurities. \n\nRelationships don\u2019t all end in flames, it is completely fine to remain friends with an ex. If you haven\u2019t been able to stay friends with yours it might be time to do some self reflection.\n\nMy bf and his ex rescued a kitten together and I can\u2019t imagine telling her she can\u2019t see her baby ever again \ud83d\ude2d\n\nThe kitten is bonded with his adult male cat which is why he got custody, I feel like a stepmom like I would be gutted if I don\u2019t see them again \n\nWe are a cluster of crazy cat people so maybe that\u2019s the secret? Idk", "NTA, start dating grownups if this one doesn\u2019t work out.", "YTA\n\nAnd very insecure.", "NTA he\u2019s lucky to have someone who is helping him finally put up boundaries and (it sounds like) finally cut the cord on the ex.  Sometimes those leftover pieces of old relationships bleed into current ones and it takes a patient partner to put up with it and also shut it down for good.\n\nUpdate: I cannot comprehend that this isn\u2019t a unanimous vote in your favor.  Like \u2026.. for those of us who have gone through breakups with pets it\u2019s like \u2026.. did the cat not go with the right owner?  What is even happening here?  If she\u2019s that crazy for the cat why didn\u2019t she get the cat in the breakup?  Was it primarily her cat and she just couldn\u2019t afford to keep it?  Twenty year marriages end with less fuss over the cat.  The cat is always more belonging to one person than the other. Mystifying.  It just seems like the cat cannot be the real reason she\u2019s contacting your man.  I think she wants your man at least a little or to be able to continue to manipulate him.", "NTA. Not much is worse than having to deal with a lingering ex when in a new relationship. Except having to deal with a lingering ex after a couple of years into a relationship.", "NTA. I was already on NTA but totally confirmed it for me when OP said the ex had her blocked. I say that you should let the ex can come over when OP and the cat is there. No keys. No bf. I\u2019m sure the ex will def not want to come see the cat \ud83d\ude02", "Op does she live out of the area? Sounds like she\u2019s hitting him up when she\u2019s in town. And the cat is just an excuse to see him.", "NTA. I'm surprised it's not unanimous.", "NTA it\u2019s a cat not a child. If she really even cared about it then she would have seen it more often from the get go.", "If it hadn't been for her asking \" oh I can't see you?\" ( something along those lines) then I would gently say YTA for not having better communication with your boyfriend but her asking that IS sketchy. I get people can have deep attachment to animals but your boyfriend does need to be respectful of this boundary and tell her that she can communicate with you about the cat if he's busy. Example she asks to see the cat he can tell her he's not home but you are and would be happy to let her see the cat. If she doesn't want to talk to you that should only make him see that the cat is just the excuse shes using and that while she may actually want to see the cat shes more hoping to see him. This is something he needs to see on his own to really be able to be effective when doing something about it", "She\u2019s trying to keep herself relevant in his life and using the cat. I do think your bf need therapy just for his people pleasing to the extreme ( meaning crying because he told her no) \n\nMaybe talk with him and see if he will block her??", "NTA. She needs to get her own cat and move on with her life.", "NTA it's a cat. I've seen this happen more genuinely with a dog. But cat's don't get that emotionally attached. importantly and the distinction with dogs - the cat does not care.", "Yeah, you sound controlling and really insecure.", "Hmmm, I feel like if I broke up with my partner, he would definitely get the cat because we owns the house and I wouldn\u2019t want to take my cat away from his home. But I would be devastated and would probably want to see my cat once a year too", "I'm a cat person so I actually understand her wanting to visit the cat. However, it's time for her to move on.  She probably figured she'd ask and had a fifty-fifty chance at seeing the cat.", "This is weird", "As a pet owner who got cats with my ex I can say at least for myself since I know those sweet babies have a loving dad and home, I\u2019m not the least bit worried about them.  I would NEVER ask to see them in person.  But I would hope if he ever had to rehome them he would let me know.  When you break up with someone  one of you breaks up with the pets as well.  This is NOT normal pet owner stuff.", "Sounds like she uses the cat as an excuse to see bf when shes in town for the holidays", "Yeah, this is the situation I want and have had.\n\nMore people who love your pets is amazing, not weird.", "I mean its not about the cat its about her. Whether she actually wants to see the cat or just him is another question of course, but people certainly get attached to animals and it hurts to lose them. Not sure why you think she wants to see the cat for the csts sake and not herself.\n\nI do however agree that the bfs reaction was a bit odd, sensitive is an understatement", "Im aware its a minority thing, but my partners exs do pop up sometimes. He'll go have a drink with them, or invite them out to something. Then thats it. Not a big deal.\n\nHe split with them for reasons. Im not, and havent ever been, threatened by them. We had one as a roommate for a few months when we'd just started dating, and shes stayed with us a few times since.\n\nI just would rather be in a relationship where I trust my partner implicitly. If he broke that trust our relathionship would be over, but it would also be over if I felt like I couldnt trust him or he didnt trust me. We both understand that, so its clear.\n\nWe kept the cat that \"belonged\" to the roommate ex. As well as 2 spiney mice, 29 gerbils, and 2 geckos. She actually liked the cat and tried to steal her back a few times...im smarter than her as it turns out. Lol\n\nI still let her come say hi to the kitty a few times, even after the half-baked theft attempts. And she sent me condolences when our girly passed 2 years ago.\n\nAny relationship Ive been in its been really clear the pets would go with me. But if I left a pet with someone, for any reason, Id absolutely be asking to visit or for pictures occasionally. And Id swallow my tongue with good manners before I did anything to risk that chance.\n\nETA: my exes sucked on ice. Id be thrilled to never see any of them again. Lol\n\nBut I have hung out with people who had crushes on me, or who used to. My partner has always been fine with that too.\n\nJust to be clear that this is, and has to be, a \"goes both ways\" situation. Lol", "This man criedddd over setting a small boundary? Simple \u201cNo you can\u2019t come over\u201d ..He has not moved on at all. Seriously sounds like he\u2019s hiding ops existence from his ex. \n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just a people pleaser\u201d I am too and being home when people I don\u2019t want to see ask me to hangout is the best because I can comfortably tell them \u201cno\u201d because it\u2019s my home and if they bother me at my home I\u2019m calling the proper authorities and reporting them for trespassing lmao \n\nThis is just weird op have you gone through his phone?? I would never, but I also wouldn\u2019t be with someone that cries over their ex, obviously something\u2019s up", "yes she lives in another state", "Oh goodness", "Evil!! \ud83d\ude02", ">Imagine the cat was a child\n\nIt's not. It's a cat.", "I wouldn't do this myself, but \"joint custody\" of pets seems to be getting more common.", "Thank you\u2014I actually appreciate this perspective! I don\u2019t really know what kind of protocols people have around this.", "He seemed fine hurting you, though. He's known this has bothered you for a while, you finally convince him to stop with this ex stuff and he's in tears. \n\nJust break up. Don't be with someone who cries over their ex. That's not healthy.", "Can't you make the deal so that she can contact you whenever she wants to see the cat. Then you can organize that you are home and your boyfriend is out of the house. This way, this woman will probably be very awkward seeing the cat and stop this yearly weirdness, and nobody is the bad guy.", "Sounds kinda manipulative.  Or needs therapy.", "That's not your problem. Good for you for having a spine, someone in this relationship has to. \n\nPut an end to this now. She sees this as a way to get back with him and everyone except your boyfriend can see this.I mean he's ok with hurting YOU? Tell him he's free to go back to her if \"hurting her\" hurts him.", "Why cry did the cat die?", "It is super sketchy that she blocked you. He should not still be in contact with a woman who blocked his girlfriend.", "So, what were you saying to her that she blocked you?", "Your nta girl dont let anyone tell you otherwise. His ex needs to move tf on.", "There\u2019s also more going on here than an ex coming up in conversation.  I don\u2019t think that in and of itself is your problem with the situation is it?", "Im not going to tell you about your relationship, but Ill absolutely tell you about mine.\n\nMy bf has been close friends with his exs in the past. And thats fine with me. He's with me now, he's given me no reason not to trust him, and its now been 17 years.\n\nWe each have close friends of the opposite gender, no jealousy. We all hang out, or he'll go out with his friends or a friend, and Ill go out with my friends or friend. No stress.\n\nIMO, and that of my partner, if I didnt trust him to talk to and hang out with a person, including an ex, and have complete faith that nothing would happen...our relationship would have no trust and that would mean it was already over. Neither of us wants to be in a situation where we dont trust our partner, so we behave with integrity and trust our partner to do the same.\n\nThat includes telling each other who we're hanging out with, what the plan generally is, and when we'll be home. Abd we try to update if plans change or we run late. Tbh, thats more about safety than anything else.\n\nTake this girl at face value. She's missing the kitty she had a bond with.\n\nIt costs you nothing to be kind and let her visit the cat.", "yeah. I've never been on bad terms with an ex and on a couple occasions when over a decade has passed I've even arranged small catch ups.\n\nRegardless of intent, staying friends with an ex is an immature idea and is typically not healthy for either party.\n\nBefore i get bombarded - yea i understand there are exceptions to this and not all humans share my experience.", "That\u2019s what I was thinking, people pleaser or not that\u2019s not a normal reaction to your ex not coming over to yours. And if you are that much of a people pleaser you\u2019re crying over your gf having a problem with your ex going to your house then you are not ready to be in a relationship. Frankly, I smell cheating, or at the very least they still have feelings for each other, going over to someone\u2019s house after breaking up 2 years ago is just plain weird.", "Id love an update if anything comes of this sounds extremelyyyy familiar, good luck Op", "That doesn\u2019t make it right. It\u2019s dumb. This isn\u2019t a child, be adults about it", "Exactly that blocking part speaks volumes.", "Not really. OP says she put a stop to the bf allowing the ex to ft the cats so if the ex really did just want to see the cats, then it's reasonable to be upset and not want to interact with the person who stopped your relationship with your pet.", "It really isnt, given how OP has spoken about the ex here my hunch is shes been less than civil. And probably had some pointed wirds about how \"desperate\" the ex was to see the cat.", "It's really not that weird. Some people are cool with their partner being friends with exes, some aren't. It's really not that uncommon.", "She shouldn\u2019t be surprised at the change, he\u2019s had a gf for nearly 2 years at this point. This change has been a long time coming, and frankly if she had any respect for her ex\u2019s relationship she wouldn\u2019t expect to go to his house at all, especially when it\u2019s just the two of them.", "A pet is like a child to some people, though. They build bonds and can get depressed if not around their loved ones.", "It\u2019s still controlling and always comes from a place of insecurity", "It seems a lot of commenters on here really think the ex wants to see the cat when she really wants to see the boyfriend.  Listen to your gut on this.", "not everyone finds that disrespectful. i was with my ex for 8 years, & we\u2019re friends. it\u2019s a dealbreaker for me if anyone won\u2019t accept our friendship, & i couldn\u2019t care less who they keep in contact with.  \nwe didn\u2019t have any pets together, but i would let him see them whenever he wanted.", "Frankly, that\u2019s still her cat \ud83d\uded1.", "A pet is nothing like a child.", "Security is a relationship is earned. It's not the default. It's not earned by crying over an ex.", "At this point it\u2019s really not, it\u2019s her ex boyfriend\u2019s cat that she visits every once in awhile.", "Opinions are like assholes, everyone has one and some people's are shitty \ud83e\udd37"]}
