Foster children are not perfect far from it, and we already go bouncing from place to place where people seen us nothing more than a paycheck.

Heaven forfend.", "YTA I don't think you should be fostering children.", "You disgust me and shouldn\u2019t foster children. You sound like you lack all empathy. Children are literally developing how to adequately express their emotions, this child has most likely been through something traumatic and instead of assistance, you berate for not sitting around a table? \n\nEveryone needs down time AWAY from others. YTA. I hope they stop allowing you to foster.", "Hear me out. Read the whole post first\u2026 YTA", "YTA. Why are you fostering if you don't have basic parenting skills?", "Wow\u2026YTA. She chewed with her mouth open in protest. She has attitude. She\u2019s a foster child and has probably gone through a lot in a short amount of time. Instead of being compassionate it sounds like you just see her as a dollar sign. These kids I\u2019m sure need a firm touch, but they need love. You are so wrong in your words. She has every right to tell the social worker. Maybe those kids shouldn\u2019t be in your care because you sound like a disgusting human being.", "YTA\nAnd people wonder why foster kids end up as fucked up adults.", "Op, you\u2019re a disgusting human for treating her like that. She\u2019s a CHILD. How dare you foster children if you\u2019re going to treat them like this. You\u2019re what\u2019s wrong with the system. She\u2019s 12, you\u2019re lucky that\u2019s the only attitude you\u2019re getting from her especially with the way you\u2019re talking to and about her. \nImagine talking about kicking out a literal child you took in.", "YTA- this is a child who has been bouncing around the system. A pre-teen with some attitude is NORMAL.\n\nI hope they remove this child from your custody because the only disgusting person here is you.", "YTA\u2026as a psychologist who works with children in foster care, I really hope you are no longer allowed to foster children. People like you make my job so much harder and it\u2019s heartbreaking", "Neither you nor your wife should not be a foster parent.  These kids have had it rough, they have had adults do exactly what you're doing and worse.  What they need is unconditional love to show them they have value just because they exist.  The most minor thing and the only thing I can say without breaking rules is YTA.", "YTA, and should stop fostering.\n\nYikes. An actual parent, foster or not, would figure out the whys on her behavior. Not mock her like that. Way to show you are not mature enough for this.", "YTA. Kids are in foster for a reason and those reasons require patience and empathy. Get the fuck over yourself.", "Finished reading, still going to call you a monster. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You\u2019re a monster. Kid is in a foster situation of course she\u2019s gonna have issues. You are the problem. Stop being a foster parent just to collect paychecks.", "YTA - that\u2019s not even that gross", "Yta. Holy freaking cow! How can you even ask with straight face?? You have been threatening to abandon an alrdy broken, abandoned child for yrs. For doing what most kids do (push boundaries) but most kids that enter the system at her age almost always struggle & fight to find their footing. And because she wanted to eat in her room, you have taken it to tearing a little girl to pieces. I guarantee if you had a son & he did that, you would probably laugh", "Yes. Absolutely YTA. You are **never** supposed to permanently impose temporary traits on children. Why do you even foster children if you don't like them?\n\nIE: that is disgusting > you are disgusting", "YTA really? Open mouth chewing is the grossest thing this kid has done? She is one of the least disgusting children I\u2019ve ever heard of \ud83e\udd23", "It\u2019s funny because you\u2019re the most disgusting person I have ever heard. YTA", "YTA.  You don't care about this girl at all. All you're doing is collecting a paycheck.  Hopefully, she gets taken from your home.", "I had a foster parent like you. Nothing I did pleased her. I was called a devil child. All I did was exist. You don't need foster kids. YTA", "Sounds like a you problem, not a her problem. You shouldn't be doing foster care, and she deserves a loving foster home which is clearly not yours.

She'd probably be better off if you did have her sent to someone else because you clearly can't stand her presence and treat her like shit.", "You are a grown up- this child is in your care- YTA \nI hope somehow she is able to be rehomed and is raised by a person who has compassion and is kind to her", "YTA, and she deserves a safe home where she is cared for with unconditional love.  Kick her out?  She's displaying pretty normal annoying preteen behavior.  I feel very sorry for her with your threats.  Good for her informing her social worker!  It WAS a big thing.  You really should be investigated .. have a feeling this is just the tip of the iceberg.  OP - YTA.", "My daughter hates the sound of other people eating.  You are probably a loud gross eater and you are unaware.  Maybe you should not be a foster parent of one incident like this sets you off.", "YTA", "YTA.\n\nYou should not be fostering children. I hope you haven't reproduced on your own either because you clearly have no empathy for this girl and you and your wife discuss \"kicking out\" a child.\n\nFind another way to make a living, and don't inflict yourselves on any more struggling kids.", "YTA 100%. Stop fostering kids.", "YTA. Your job is to parent. At the first sign of difficulty you talked about kicking her out. Sounds like you don't actually give a shit about this kid you're supposedly looking after. Hope she gets moved to a more caring home.", "you should not be fostering kids lol", "YTA; Social worker here, Who works with foster children. You are a disgusting human being saying that to a child. Be ashamed of yourself\n\n\nI hope your childs case worker sees this and removes the child for her own good.", "YTA. This kid is 12. It is developmentally appropriate for her to be backtalking to you. And considering that you and your wife want to get rid of her because she's a preteen like she's a t-shirt that doesn't fit is terrible. I'm glad she's tipped off the social worker about your self-proclaimed disgust for her, and I hope you get your act together before throwing this kid away.", "You begin by asking readers to finish reading before \"calling you a monster for saying such a mean thing to a kid\". So you know YTA. If you aren't ready to support a kid with a deep need for that support, don't opt to be a foster parent.", "YTA in a major way . You have no business being a foster parent -nice way to add trauma to a kid with trauma.", "poor kid. hope she gets a better placement with parents who don\u2019t tell her she\u2019s disgusting. she\u2019s a kid, for starters. and the issue here isn\u2019t that you called out her behavior, it\u2019s that you DIDN\u2019T call out her behavior. you should have told her chewing like that was disgusting but instead, you looked a 12 year old girl in the face and called HER disgusting. she will probably never forget that. if anything OP, YOU are disgusting. you definitely did not pay attention during those foster parent courses. just another person in it for money. \n\nYTA.", "YTA. She wasn't gross, you were.\n\nManipulative, cruel, callous behaviour towards a kid you've kept walking on eggshells for *years,* and I'd say you should be ashamed of yourself but it's pretty clear from your post that you don't realize just how disgusting your own behaviour is. How could you say that to a kid for just doing dumb kid stuff? \n\nThis girl deserves so much better than you've given her. She was right to tell the social worker. I hope she gets placed with a better family and you get removed from the registry. You shouldn't be around children.", "YTA. I read the whole thing and you definitely still sound like an asshole.\n\nWhy even make her leave her room when it's obvious you don't seem to enjoy dealing with her as evidenced by your repeated talks of kicking her out.\n\nStop fostering, seek therapy.", "YTA. You didn\u2019t like her from the word go, and she knew that. She will not show respect to you when you have none for her as a human being.", "YTA you shouldn't be a foster parent", "Yes YTA.  And if something as typical as a 12 y/o acting out like this pushes you to (or past) your limits,  I might rethink what you've signed up for in terms of fostering.  These kids not only need ALL your patience and understanding, but even more than you're likely prepared to give.", "Nah. He doesn\u2019t deserve a second chance after that bs. I\u2019ve pulled his IP and have reported him to his local social services for neglect and maltreatment", "Yup. My kid farts and used to blame the cat. They're kids, kids can get sassy, especially at that age on, and all kids are gross. If you can't deal with that, don't have kids. Shit, at my Dad's 50th Birthday, I made an infomercial on his birthday video for paper bags for your face. Fucking with your parents is forever. \n\n\n\"Opening their mouth while eating\", I fucking WISH that's all my kid has done, lol. What a wuss.", "I don't even like kids and it breaks my hearts for this child. To think that this child comes with 9 years to OP with whatever history, maybe x foster family gave her up, parents dead or just don't care and OP expects a child without problems?! Even a standard 9y/o is difficult but with all this baggage a child in this age shouldn't carry, you need lots of empathy. But OP doesn't care. \n\nYTA so much!
