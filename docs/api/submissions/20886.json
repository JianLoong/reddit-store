So I had both my seat and my boyfriends empty seat next to me. \n\n\nSo after first class got settled and the rest of the passengers were coming on the plane, I was answering a couple questions over Teams until a flight Attendant came by with a mom and a young daughter and asked if I could change seats so they could Sit together. Tbh, I didn't want to, we paid for those seats, I was looking forward to having both a window and an isle seat, and I didn't want to move. \n\n\nSo I told them no. The kid started crying, and that made me even more uncomfortable so i just mumbled out a sorry and went back to my phone. The flight Attendant seemed annoyed at me for the rest of the flight and upon texting my partner about the situation he said I should have moved for them. This led to an argument because we mostly get first class flights because of me and he doesn't want me to sit next to a strange dude or anything.

The flight attendant messed up this situation. She shouldn\u2019t have brought the mother and child over with her when she asked you. She should have left them while she went through the plane to see if there was an option for them, or made an announcement asking for volunteers. She also should have explained where you\u2019d be moving to if you had given up your seat. It sounds like you don\u2019t even know whether the mom and daughter were in first class as well or if you were being asked to move to economy. That kind of poor communication is inexcusable for someone who works in a customer service role. You were unfairly put on the spot and not given sufficient information, so declining was completely understandable.", "NAH  - This story doesn't make sense at all. A flight attendant wouldn't ask you to switch seats with people sitting in economy if you are in first class. That doesn't happen. Why didn't you even ask what their seats were? You are never obligated to switch seats if you don't want to. So I guess the fact that you didn't ask what seats they have doesn't really matter. But this whole things sounds bogus.\n\nAnd you are not actually entitled to your BF's seat just because he didn't make the trip.

The plane seats were shuffled for some reason, I think to accommodate airline staff. The result was that a family was upgraded to an exit row. Unfortunately, children can\u2019t be an exit rows, so the staff wanted them to sit by themselves somewhere else on the plane. The poor dad was so upset, so I switched seats along with a stranger so all of them could be together. \n\nI tell you the story just to point out that sometimes shit happens and you weren\u2019t in control.

First class or not, paying for two close seats was meaning you would have had extra space. And not by chance but because you PAID it.\nNow, either business or economy, you clearly wouldn't have had the extra space if switching with them (because they clearly weren't sitting close to each other). So your bf's expense would have gone completely wanted. Worse: would have meant giving extra space to someone else random! Why would you when it was a paid seat AND the only way to not completely waste the money? If the attendant was so child-mindful she should have asked to someone else random to move, not to the person who would have clearly been the more disturbed by moving.

Because she offered you an option instead, shame on the FA for being upset with you.\n\nNext time, the FA should give more information so you can make a better informed decision perhaps.

Questions:\n\n* Why didn't you request a refund or credit for BF's seat?  \n* What airline did you fly?  Reason I ask is that most of the equipment between the mainland and Hawaii is widebody, and the F class seats are often the lie-flat seats...  so it's not like you would be getting an A (window) and C (aisle) seat together like on domestic, narrowbody F class.  Getting an extra seat in Y class is a bonus, but getting an extra seat in F class is a waste of $$$ if you've actually paid for it.\n* When the FA asked you if you wanted to move, where would you have been moved to?

You should not have to be inconvenienced by her lack of planning. \n\nForgive my rant, but this is really an issue of airlines not making adequate allowances to properly serve their diverse customer demographics. In addition to FC, BC, and economy seating, they should have dedicated space on the plane reserved for families traveling together (for safety and the sake of keeping crying babies in one part of the plane), people with disabilities, and plus-sized or tall passengers. \n\nI really don't have any sympathy for the airlines on this issue because they created the problems themselves by overbooking flights and squishing as many seats as possible in the plane to treat most passengers as cattle.", "I hear it weekly only in this sub!

Given that she hadn't paid for an extra seat just for herself. \nIf I was in the situation that I wasn't seated with my child, I would really hope someone would move for us.", "Let us know in 10 years if you get married and still find it endearing.", "If you don\u2019t check in, it\u2019s not your seat.  She paid for one and gave up or refunded one, she didn\u2019t pay for two.", "Then they are idiots for not telling you they wanted to keep you in first class when they asked.  In that case NTA", "Why not ask?", "[deleted]", "I mean, maybe the mother should have purchased adjoining seats instead of leaving it up to chance", "It's not OP's responsibility to make concessions for other people's poor planning.", "Potentially if I felt bad enough, but I get weird in groups of people and especially in enclosed areas with groups of people like on a plane so it has to be an isle seat otherwise I'm deeply uncomfortable all flight", "Well, they didn\u2019t resell it, did they?", "She's already in first class with an empty seat next to her. Why would she change?", "Doesn't matter. OP paid for those seats, she's not an asshole for keeping them.", "They are already in first class.  Are they going to switch around and end up as copilot?", "Why do we assume the mother/daughter planned poorly? I've definitely had flights canceled on me and get rebooked by the airline in a seat that's different/worse than the one I originally picked.", "That\u2019s irrelevant.  If you don\u2019t check in, it\u2019s not your seat.  Objectively.  Unless you literally buy yourself two tickets, you don\u2019t get to claim an empty seat just because you know the person who didn\u2019t fly.  They probably got credit for a change anyway.  Regardless, yes, it\u2019s annoying to be asked to move but not every decent action in life has to be convenient.  Assuming she was just being asked to move to a similar seat, I think that\u2019s kind of rotten not to make a small concession for someone.  If it was to a worse seat, obviously no issue whatsoever", "[deleted]", "She gets an empty seat next to her because she didn\u2019t switch the mom and daughter and no one else requested to sit there. Mom should\u2019ve planned better if sitting apart was going to be such a problem for the daughter. It\u2019s not OP\u2019s responsibility to quell the child\u2019s crying or anxiety. It doesn\u2019t make OP an asshole because she didn\u2019t switch. She\u2019s just as entitled to her seat as anyone else on the plane.", "that's not how first class works", "Flight attendant should have found the fattest fuck in the back of the bus and upgraded them to the empty seat next to herout of spite.  Technically could have happened at any point and technically would have been perfectly above board.  Still an asshole move if they did.  Not everything is judged by \u201cjust because you can\u201d", "[deleted]", "Yikes", "there's no lack of leg room in first class anyways and the extra seat lets her stretch out"]}
