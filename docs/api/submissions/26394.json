Hopefully one day someone will show you as much, hilarious respect as you showed him", "I think you should pay him for his food, since you should only honk your horn when necessary, and this wasn't exactly vital to maintaining a safe flow of traffic. With that said, $100 is insane. I know inflation's a bitch, but I doubt his food cost that much lol.", "NTA\n\nProbably an unpopular opinion but the way it's described, he wasn't like directly in front of you when you honked. If he's that high strung that a quick toot ruins his day, that's not your problem.

Watch where you're going", "NTA. Whether you used your horn for whatever reason is irrelevant. You were in public and didn\u2019t assault the man or cause any crime that would\u2019ve resulted in you being responsible for him dropping his own food. And I mean, did he stomp on his food? Was he carrying chicken nuggets and French fries in his bare hands? I would\u2019ve just gathered it all up, went in to replace my drink, and been on my way. Fuck this guy for trying to extort $100 out of you for his own fuck up. NTA NTA NTA", "NTA. I don't see how you're to blame that the guy stepped outside and was startled by normal outside parking lot noises such as a horn. Guy who got startled is TA for making a FB rant.", "Unpopular opinion based on the comments I read but NTA, I gurantee most if not all the people judging you for using the horn outside its intended purpose have done the exact same thing. The guy whinging on facebook looking for a $100 needs to wake up, smells the roses and stop living in a fantasy land. I wouldn't even offer to reimburse him for anything myself. A sincere apology is more than enough", "Yes, you are, I HATE people who beep for no good reason. The only reasons to beep are to warn someone you are there for safety, as in other wise you might knock them over, or crash into another vehicle. I am easily startled, and hate when people do this. Have some consideration for others please.", "YTA", "ESH. He shouldn't be asking for $100, just reimbursement for what he lost. You should definitely pay him for the food, and learn to use your horn correctly.", "You can literally get fined $350 for improper use of your car horn. That's how serious this is.\nYes YTA.", "You are an AH for finding his stress hilarious, but you don't owe him $100. People have that kind of startle response usually due to trauma, it's a stress reaction. But sure, enjoy your laugh at his expense.", "You would be the asshole if it was intentional but you were honking at a friend what if someone had honked on the road driving by would he expect that person to pay for his food. You are not an asshole", " YTA Pay him but ask for a receipt first. And use the horn for traffic.", "YTA for laughing, but not for what happened. If you had been beeping because someone ran out in front of you the same thing would have happened, would not be your fault.", "I mean, you shouldn\u2019t beep the horn unless it\u2019s necessary in traffic but he shouldn\u2019t just demand 100 dollars from you. I\u2019d understand he wants the money back he paid for his food and an apology but just asking for 100 dollars is crazy so NTA", "ESH - but 100 bucks for McDonald is a bit much. He\u2019s trying to fleece you for money. 100\nBucks can get 7 full meals which is too much for someone to carry alone and if he ordered that much food it\u2019s common to get or ask for a carry out bag for that amount of food. What he have sounds more like around 50-60 bucks worth. \n\nI kind of question how loud is that honking of yours and how long did you hold it for? It\u2019s common nowadays to honk to greet someone. It\u2019s still an AH move but usually it\u2019s not loud enough to really startle someone unless you\u2019re like 5 feet away from them.\n\nI won\u2019t judge you too harsh for this cause you sound like you\u2019re willing to replace his food, but he\u2019s the AH for demanding more than what he paid for.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't have honked without a good reason. However, requesting a hundred dollars is completely unreasonable.", "Whether you meant it or not, it's your fault he dropped the food. You should definitely pay to replace the spoiled food and drinks, and apologize (which it seems like you were going to do if you had found him). Maybe throw in a cheeky mcflurry for the inconvenience.\nThe \u20ac100 demand is just silly. You don't need compensation for being startled. \nIf possible, get him a McDonald's voucher for \u20ac20-\u20ac25 and put on a note saying \"sorry I startled you that one time\" and go on with your life with a clear conscience. \n\nSoft ESH", "NTA - If you are walking through a parking lot, you need to be aware of your surroundings.  Your beep, even if it had been intentional, (and I understand it wasn't) should not have surprised him enough to drop all of his food.  \n\n\nHim demanding $100 makes this even more of a case of greedy AH trying to guilt you.

It was nice of you to offer to replace his food and his request for $100 is ridiculous.", "Ngl I would have thought it was funny too \ud83d\ude02 he\u2019s an idiot begging for likes on Facebook expecting a 100 my only worry would be that the meal could have been all he had that day and no money to replace it offer him a refund on that and nothing else x", "NTA. It was an unintentional thing, most call that an accident. People are so sensitive it seems there\u2019s only Villains and victims.  It\u2019s freaking McDonalds and dude wants $100, he was embarrassed and only wants you to be as well.  I dropped my food once on my own and the McDonald\u2019s replaced it for free when I went back inside to repurchase.  Ignore it and move on.", "NTA.\n\nHe makes asking for $100 look like his side hustle.  I get that he's mad because he actually dropped his food, but...\n\nHe could have simply posted on Facebook a general message to be mindful that honking a horn can be startling, and left it at that.\n\nI would just post back your apology, and that you actually laughed because the same thing has happened to you also, and you laughed then too (even if it hasn't)\ud83d\ude0f.\n\nIt wasn't a prank, so an apology was all you plan to give him, and that you wanted to do it then but could not find him.

At the end of the day this is more hassle than its worth and you don't really want this spreading round the town I appreciate.\n\n$100 seems like a lot of McDonalds also which is why I would recommend asking for the receipt or something similar.\n\nIf they don't accept it move on with your life they cannot do anything to you.", "NTA. I was inclined to say  y t a  from the title, except in the post you say that you\u2019re willing to reimburse him for the food but not the $100 he\u2019s demanding.

If you get that startled over a car horn at a drive thru of all places then idk what to tell you. Unless you jumped out of a bush and grabbed him, it\u2019s his own fault. I know if I were him I\u2019d be pissed, but I wouldn\u2019t be blaming anyone but myself. Secondly, $100 is truly laughable, there\u2019s zero chance that food was worth anywhere near that, what\u2019s the rest of the money for? Has he been traumatised by this experience? The fact that he actually bothered to post about it on Facebook tells you everything, he\u2019s an AH.\n\nAlso I see a lot of comments here from people acting as if they\u2019ve never used their car horn before except in dire circumstances, you lot are fooling no one lol. Maybe it\u2019s just where I live but I genuinely don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been to my local McDonald\u2019s and not heard at least one car horn between me leaving and returning to my house, I hear them all the time and I can guarantee 99% of the time it isn\u2019t being used in the way it was intended.", "NTA.
