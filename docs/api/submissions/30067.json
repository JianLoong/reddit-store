{"id": 30067, "submission_id": "17kwlaj", "title": "AITA for not letting my husband shower when he wants?", "selftext": "Mostly SAHM of two kids here, ages one and three. I work two days a week at most, usually only one. Most of the time I'm home with them.\n\nMy husband is a blue collar worker in construction. He works long days, his job is pretty physical, and he works really hard. He gets up at 5am and gets home by 630. My days are usually around the same, give or take an extra hour in the morning.\n\nEvery single day my husband gets home, he wants to go to the bathroom and take a shower the second he gets in the driveway. This would be one thing if he was quick--but he takes at least 25 minutes on the toilet and 25 minute showers, and I cannot start dinner with the kids hanging off my legs. They just scream and cry every single time. I've started to ask him to wait until they go to bed, given I really only have a 2 hour window to get dinner ready, eat, clean up the dishes, clean up their chairs, get them ready for bed, get them baths etc.\n\nHe complied at first, but he's now telling me it's very unfair to ask him to sit in dirty clothes and be a sweaty mess for two hours until they get to bed. Which I understand it's uncomfortable, but you know...I've just been alone with the kids for 13 hours straight. Every day. I have stuff I still need to get done, too. My kids are in their tantrum phase as well, which has been really hard. \n\nHe got really snippy with me today and said I was being incredibly selfish when I asked him to wait. I said I felt he was being selfish by running to the bathroom for almost an hour every time he gets home when he *knows* I have stuff to get done, too.\n\nSo, AITA here? Or is he?\n\nEdit to Add for INFO: I see so many comments about decompression time. None of this is about decompression time, it's about getting the kids to bed on time because they wake up even *earlier* if I don't get them to bed by 8pm. We have plenty of time after they go to sleep for ourselves, and I don't mind him doing whatever he wants to do at that point. I have exactly 1.5 hours to get dinner done, clean up, clean them up (and no, I can't give them a bath before dinner--they're messy eaters), read them a story and get ready for bed. If you take 50 minutes away from that, I have no time left.\n\nI also want to add I am very much just saying construction as a general term. Some of all are acting like he's covered in mud, filth and fiberclass--he's not. He's a very sweaty person and his job is not \"dirty.\" I don't want to say his job title as there are people in this sub I know. \n\nEdit 2: some of you are also misunderstanding what I'm asking--I'm not asking him to wait two hours to shower, I'm asking him to wait 30 minutes so I can get dinner done, get him and the kids fed, and then he has the rest of the evening to himself to shower, decompress, play his games etc. I take care of the rest of the night.

He can come home, change into clean sweats and jump in to help you out. The real issue is he doesn\u2019t want to help so he purposely occupies all that time.  \nWrite up a schedule & rotate duties. He works hard but you are a de facto single mom.", "Tell him he can keep showing but don't bring the phone in.", "I'm with hubby. He has been at work all day and he is want to shower and decompress.\nThat's his hour. Let him have it.\nAnd super yuck on him sitting around dirty.\n\nYou can move dinner or start it earlier and I call TOTAL BS on I can't cook with 2 toddlers cause did it myself.\n\nI do agree you also need some down time but that could be after he showers. \n\nHe can be totally in charge of post dinner wind downs baths story bed while you chill. \n\nBut yea that shower is vital and for many they need that decompress between work and home.", "YTA. I retired early so I\u2019m a SAHD. My job IS taking care of the kids. It sounds like you just need to manage your time better or manage your kids better. Your husband is coming home from a long day at work a sweaty, stinking mess. Of course he wants to shower. So what if he takes a long time? He\u2019s unwinding before he starts his second shift of work as daddy/husband. \n\nThis is the deal that you both seemingly agreed to when you became a SAHM. If you no longer like the deal then agree to a new one. Let him stay home and you get a job. You can both work and hire a nanny. \n\nIn any case, nagging at him the moment he walks through the door after coming home from work is probably not the answer. How would you feel if he started complaining about having to be the one working as soon as he came home? Nagging/complaining sucks no matter who\u2019s doing it.", "NAH. I definitely understand not wanting to cook with the kids hanging off you but not being able to take a shower after working construction would be gross. The solution is obviously a shorter shower. No phone in the bathroom.\n\nYou especially need time to decompress as well if you're not only a SAHM but a nurse as well, damn. You have a hard working household all around.", "As a construction worker that sounds pretty normal. Definitely not a terrible amount of time to use the washroom after work. And aside from that the decompression time is very important.

I understand not wanting to cook with kids hanging off your legs as well.  So do something about the kids.  There is no reason on God's green earth why kids should 'hang on' anyone's legs.

I\u2019m currently a SAHD because I\u2019m out of work and struggling to get more I swear to god I would trade working for staying at home with the kids anyday. Let the man have his peace he\u2019s providing y\u2019all quite the life from how it seems if all he wants is a hour after work he should be able to get that. \n\nAsk him to shit after dinner just come in take your 25 minute shower and please help so I can get dinner started I guarantee what he\u2019s craving most is that shower that time on the potty is just an added bonus that I\u2019m sure he would compensate with if you sat down and spoke to him like an adult and don\u2019t come off as preachy the man just worked his balls off the last thing he needs is you barking at him.

I have to assume 99% of them are from elementary aged children without jobs and without kids to make sense.   \n\n\nNTA. Neither of your jobs trumps the other. You work all day in the home and he works all day outside of it. When he comes home, he should be equally participatory in things like cooking/cleaning/watching the kids. Either he agrees to a 20min shower/poop with a set timer or he has to wait until after they're in bed to get clean. If he goes over the 20mins, turn off the internet and the hot water.", "Let the man shower, but ask him to take shorter showers. He is dirty.

He could of compromised and take the shower first and helped you with the kids THEN take his long shits after the kids are done. Cant imagine anyone's bowel movement is this on time and consistent everyday.", "NTA - it is a bit silly to call you selfish when you are trying to get the family together for dinner - hardly a selfish act. Kids need to be in bed by 7:30ish I would guess.\n\nCan 100% understand why he wants to spend some time in the shower after a hard day at work. Surely there is a workable compromise here - a 20 minute shower would still be ample.", "Yeah this dude needs to be able to do his own thing after hard days work kids are stressful but so is paying all the bills and working a job you probably hate most days let the dude shower", "YTA. You sound selfish. That man is supporting you with his physical labor and you can\u2019t even let him shower.

Do SAHMs just wing it all day or do they not believe in schedule & routine & then wonder why their 5yr old is having problems in school with schedule, routine & most importantly ORDER!

How about giving them an activity instead of running crazy for 10hrs straight so that man that affords you to be that SAHM can wash his day away & \ud83d\udca9 in the comforts of his own home instead of the port a potty at work!

Either a 50 minute shower or none.  Isn't the solution just a shorter shower?\n\nYes, it's reasonable for him to want to shower off when he comes home.  Construction is dirty, and it's uncomfortable to sit in your dirty, sweaty clothes for hours.  Especially since he'll be getting all of that dirt all over your house and kids if he doesn't.  It's NOT reasonable for him to take nearly an hour to himself at a busy time in the night for your family.  You need his help, so he needs to be helping.  \n\nHe should take a quick, 15 minute shower when he comes home so he can be helping.

This isn\u2019t a case of waiting to do something like playing video games or tinkering in the garage. This is basic hygiene. You are horribly selfish and unreasonable.

Instead of making him wait for 2 hours, can he shower after dinner instead of waiting all the way until bed time? Honestly, I had the same issue with my partner who also works construction (GC so they're not necessarily filthy when they get home either). Our therapist recommended that my partner get 20 min downtime when they get home. It really, really helped. This is a NAH situation to me.

As somebody who works in the restaurant industry and very much needs a shower the minute I get home as well, l understand where he's coming from. I really need to get that layer of sweat off me to fully feel like I'm home and ready to decompress.

You\u2019re constantly going and at those ages, kiddos need a lot of attention. And you sometimes need a brief reprieve even if it\u2019s just to cook dinner in peace. Your husband should acknowledge and honor that. On balance, to your point, he\u2019s just come home from working a long day and maybe it\u2019s his time to decompress. He\u2019s entitled to decompress but he\u2019s going about it the wrong way. Sounds like you both need to sit and talk and be really transparent  about what you need.

Consider it part of his work time, when he comes out of there, he is yours again. Asking him to be quicker is reasonable though.", "ESH. It is 100% unnecessary to take an hour in the bathroom when he gets home. If it takes him 25 minutes to poop he should see a doctor and adjust his diet. And a 25minute shower after that is also taking much too long. He is abusing that time alone in the bathroom to avoid taking care of the kids. BUT wanting to shower after being sweaty all day is not that out of the ordinary. You should give him a time limit of 20 minutes after he gets home to do his business and shower and then he is either on kid duty or dinner duty. Hand him the kids while he\u2019s in the shower and go deal with dinner. He will eventually get his routine down so he is showered and ready to do either job  in his allotted time frame. Worst case scenario he does a quick rinse when he gets home and then goes for a longer muscle relaxing shower later if that\u2019s the reason for the longer shower. You\u2019re not telling him he can\u2019t have his time just that he can\u2019t have it at the busiest point of the day. Eventually the kids will get older and be able to mind themselves for that time but right now he needs to help", "NTA. My dear, your husband is the AH and the selfish one. Don\u2019t for a single second let anyone make you feel that that isn\u2019t the case. You two are supposed to be in this together, but he apparently is only able to see if through his own lens, which is unfair and more importantly, unkind. However, having two kids under 3 is draining and exhausting for both parents, and neither of you are probably able to fully see the forest through the trees right now.

I work two days a week at most, usually only one. Most of the time I'm home with them.\n\nMy husband is a blue collar worker in construction. He works long days, his job is pretty physical, and he works really hard. He gets up at 5am and gets home by 630. My days are usually around the same, give or take an extra hour in the morning.\n\nEvery single day my husband gets home, he wants to go to the bathroom and take a shower the second he gets in the driveway. This would be one thing if he was quick--but he takes at least 25 minutes on the toilet and 25 minute showers, and I cannot start dinner with the kids hanging off my legs. They just scream and cry every single time. I've started to ask him to wait until they go to bed, given I really only have a 2 hour window to get dinner ready, eat, clean up the dishes, clean up their chairs, get them ready for bed, get them baths etc.\n\nHe complied at first, but he's now telling me it's very unfair to ask him to sit in dirty clothes and be a sweaty mess for two hours until they get to bed. Which I understand it's uncomfortable, but you know...I've just been alone with the kids for 13 hours straight. Every day. I have stuff I still need to get done, too. My kids are in their tantrum phase as well, which has been really hard. \n\nHe got really snippy with me today and said I was being incredibly selfish when I asked him to wait. I said I felt he was being selfish by running to the bathroom for almost an hour every time he gets home when he *knows* I have stuff to get done, too.\n\nSo, AITA here?

Both of you are struggling with overloaded work hours and no decompression time. Having little ones and a partner on long hours is *rough*.\n\nA few things stand out to me? Like, why are you the only one handling dinner, dishes, chair cleanup, and baths, all of it? If he won't cook, as you said, he needs to be doing the dishes and cleanup to keep it fair. That means he gets his 1-hour bathroom break, and you get hopefully a 1-hour break because you can finish the kids' bedtime process sooner while he's handling cleanup. That's just *fair*, there's no argument there. If he wants that time, he needs to be sure you have that time, too. And if he won't agree to that solution, tell him he's an adult and a partner, how does *he* suggest you get that same 1 hour break? \n\nHis answer might be kind of revealing tho.\n\nAnother possible solution if he's still resistant to shorter bathroom time and helping out: don't push yourself to get it all done. The dishes can wait until the next day. Like, they will survive in the sink until tomorrow. The babies don't need to be bathed every day, that's advised to be more of an every other.
