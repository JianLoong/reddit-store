{"id": 14715, "submission_id": "12ktj76", "title": "AITA for asking my queer daughter join a youth group because I'm worried for her social life?", "selftext": "I (42F) have been attending a local evangelical church with my two youngest sons (10M and 14M) for a couple months now. Both of my sons have been having a great time with the youth group, but they're also pretty social people to begin with. My daughter, Olivia (17F, named changed), is not. \n\nI'm very worried for her social life and well being in general. She never really talks to me or anyone else in the family besides her dad (47M), and I've only met one of her friends that she's really close with. Olivia is homeschooled so she doesn't meet new people her age very often, which is why I asked her to join the youth group, but she just looked at me as if I had asked her to jump into a volcano.\n\nOlivia is openly bisexual, I only really found out recently, and I didn't even consider it being an issue when I asked her to join the church. She immediately told me no, that she didn't want to go. I told her I was worried about her and just wanted her to make some friends and it spurred a bit of back and forth arguing. She told me that she's met kids like that before, how she's never had anything in common with them, and how they've always been hateful towards her. I was shocked that she was making these assumptions without even meeting them, it was so unlike her since she's always been an open minded person. I was even more shocked because she had never opened up to me about being bullied before (she wasn't always homeschooled). \n\nI asked her to at least go once and if she doesn't like it she doesn't have to go again, but she told me I wouldn't understand and went off to her room. My husband is telling me that I'm putting her in a situation she feels unsafe in, but I disagree. I don't think she has a reason to feel unsafe, the church has been nothing less than kind to me and my sons and I doubt they'd be any different to her. I've tried explaining to her that she doesn't have to be afraid but now she won't talk to me at all, even more so than usual and I'm at a loss. AITA for asking her to join the youth group?\n\n\n\n\n\n*EDIT* : I realize I am TA and plan on apologizing to Olivia tonight. I will update afterwards. A lot of what you guys have said has been eye opening, and honestly after reading some of your experiences I feel so awful for even recommending it to her. I would never knowingly put her in harms way like this and I can admit that this entire situation was ignorance on my behalf. \n\nI had no idea what went on behind closed doors of churches like these. I mean I knew some of them weren't really big fans of queer people but I had no idea that conversion \"therapy\" was still actively practiced let alone LEGAL????? I genuinely thought that was only done in the 50's. I can't say anything for this specific church yet, but I will include their stance on LGBTQ when I find out and when I update. I absolutely should have done research before going to this church. Not only because I'm a queer parent, but because I'm a queer person myself. I also realize that I should have dropped it as soon as she said no but I was so blinded by my concern for her that I didn't stop to actually listen to her. I honestly have no excuse for this and I do intend on sincerely apologizing to her, I just hope I didn't hurt her somehow.\n\nLastly I'd like to clear a few things up:\n\nOlivia is homeschooled because she has a chronic illness called m\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, not because she was forced to. She chose online school when she was given the option of homeschool or continuing public school.\n\nI have never ever shamed Olivia for being bisexual. She only came out to us recently because she herself wasn't sure, not because she was scared we wouldn't accept her (her words). I myself am bisexual, though to a complete stranger I can see how one would assume I'm straight. This might be what happened with the church now that I think about it. I didn't see her being bisexual as a potential issue in the church because it never was for me growing up. Queerness was never shunned or celebrated in my childhood church, but I was an idiot to simply assume it would be like that for most churches. I also now realize how fortunate I am to have this experience, especially given the time that I grew up in.\n\nI didn't ask Olivia to join the youth group because I wanted to \"fix\" her. That entire ideology is just appalling. I'm proud of my baby for being who she is and I would never want to change that. I suggested the youth group because most of the family was already attending the church and I thought it would be something we could all do together. I have asked Olivia if she wants to join some sort of group or community before, but she always tells me she doesn't know where to start. I think I'll ask her how she feels about some of your suggestions, if they're available in our area.\n\nTLDR; whew I messed up, definitely going to apologize.", "created_utc": 1681400952, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/12ktj76/aita_for_asking_my_queer_daughter_join_a_youth/", "score": 170, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I'm a non-binary adult that grew up in the church and still get anxiety going to church events and I stopped caring what people think of me a long time ago.

At least her dad understands, I think I know why she is mainly open with him.", "YTA. You can\u2019t tell her what groups she does and doesn\u2019t feel safe in. If you want her to socialize, put her in public school or suggest that she join a group without a religious affiliation.", "YTA simply for ignoring her experience.\n\nJoining the church group would be convenient, but there are a great amount of other things she could do to socialize. Why not start with things she enjoys doing?  After all, maybe she is just not interested in religion.\n\nAlso it's important to note that it is an issue for bisexuals to join a church because many christian religions condemn part of who they are and treat it as a behavior that can be 'corrected', not as an instrisic characteristic of who they are.\n\nFinally, you have no say in what she feels, your husband communicated how she felt to you and you decided to disagree because your experience is different, but you clearly are not bisexual, how can you argue that her experience would be the same as yours?", "YTA. Your husband is right that you are asking your daughter to go somewhere she doesn't *feel* safe. I used to facilitate LGBTQ peer-to-peer support groups and the stories I heard from the community's experiences with evangelicals run the full spectrum from just uncomfortable to absolutely abhorrent. I can't share details because they aren't my details, but there are a couple stories that turn my stomach years later. Your daughter is undoubtedly aware of similar stories. The youth group may be a fantastic experience for your sons, but that doesn't mean it would be for your daughter.

If you're so intent on sacrificing your daughter on the demented alter of fundamentalist Christianity, why not just tie her to a post in front of the church and lay the firewood.\n\nHow deep into the coolade do you have to be to even consider this?  The only saving grace is that in a few months, she can leave you and your twisted cult behind.", "YTA I think you should do research or pay more attention to rhetoric people tend to use in religious settings. Often its not positive towards LGBT+ individuals. If your daughter is telling you she feels isolated and like an outcast around these kids you should take her word for with and validate her experience. \n\nThere are lots of other types of activities that will allow your daughter to meet children her age on a regular basis and make friends. Ask her what things she\u2019s interested in and sign her up for classes. If the classes are expensive check your local recreational center. A lot of them have programs centered around teens. She\u2019ll meet people who have a common interest with her", "YTA. Churches aren't known to be tolerant of the LGBTQ+ community so she has perfectly valid reasons for not wanting to go.", "Unfortunately, YTA. Where your daughter feels safe as a queer person is up to her, not you. As a bisexual woman in a lesbian relationship, I know where she's coming from. I was invited to a evangelical service and dinner afterwards by two girls I studied with and their friends. I grew up Presbyterian with Catholic and Baptist extended family, and have had good experiences with the church throughout life. In fact, I often am paid to sing and play at churches. However, I knew that these girls believed me misguided for my \"lifestyle\" and that their particular religious education is where this viewpoint originated. Nonetheless, I went to the service out of curiosity and was polite at dinner. I consider myself a thick-skinned and analytical person, but I can imagine many of my peers feeling extremely uncomfortable\u2014even afraid\u2014at that same service.\n\nI am also an adult who willingly put myself in this position. Your daughter clearly doesn't want anything to do with your church. Furthermore, just because your church treats you and your sons with respect doesn't mean they will extend that same courtesy to your queer daughter. Do you know their stance on homosexuality? Did you bother to investigate their website or contemplate this before asking her to join the youth group? Most anti-LGTBQ+ rhetoric in the US does come from a place of religious belief. \n\nYour suggestion may have been made innocently with the best of intentions, but you became the asshole when you you continued pushing the issue. Even if it hadn't been such a sensitive and complicated topic, you still would have been the asshole had this been about a sport or a random after-school club. Your daughter is one year from legal adulthood. Unless she's hurting herself or others, how she spends her free time is her business.\n\nAsking her to join youth group doesn't make you an asshole. Putting pressure on her and dismissing her point of view does.", "Sorry Mama, but soft YTA. I want to believe that you mean well, but the church is not uniformly kind to everyone. One side of my family is deeply evangelical Christian, and despite being overall good people there is an unfortunate tendency to judge. I'm bisexual, too, and not only have they admitted to \"praying\" for me to not be bi, my favorite aunt on that side straight-up said that I could have her house because when the Rapture happens I'm clearly not going with them straight to heaven.

And I find it really hard to believe you are naive about evangelicalism and LBGTQ+ people. The history is not kind.

Because, sure, there are some christian churches that embrace LGBTQ+ people but they are in the minority. I would say as a parent to a queer teen, confirming a group you are getting involved in openly accepts every member of your family is the absolute least you can do.

Leave her alone and let her socialize in ways that feel authentic and safe for her.", "YTA. I am only a year older than you.

Both of my sons have been having a great time with the youth group, but they're also pretty social people to begin with. My daughter, Olivia (17F, named changed), is not. \n\nI'm very worried for her social life and well being in general. She never really talks to me or anyone else in the family besides her dad (47M), and I've only met one of her friends that she's really close with. Olivia is homeschooled so she doesn't meet new people her age very often, which is why I asked her to join the youth group, but she just looked at me as if I had asked her to jump into a volcano.\n\nOlivia is openly bisexual, I only really found out recently, and I didn't even consider it being an issue when I asked her to join the church. She immediately told me no, that she didn't want to go. I told her I was worried about her and just wanted her to make some friends and it spurred a bit of back and forth arguing. She told me that she's met kids like that before, how she's never had anything in common with them, and how they've always been hateful towards her. I was shocked that she was making these assumptions without even meeting them, it was so unlike her since she's always been an open minded person. I was even more shocked because she had never opened up to me about being bullied before (she wasn't always homeschooled). \n\nI asked her to at least go once and if she doesn't like it she doesn't have to go again, but she told me I wouldn't understand and went off to her room. My husband is telling me that I'm putting her in a situation she feels unsafe in, but I disagree. I don't think she has a reason to feel unsafe, the church has been nothing less than kind to me and my sons and I doubt they'd be any different to her. I've tried explaining to her that she doesn't have to be afraid but now she won't talk to me at all, even more so than usual and I'm at a loss.

She'd be nuts to think they're likely to be kind or accepting of her unless the church is an overtly queer-affirming one (and it sure doesn't sound like it is). It's not like most evangelical churches are quiet *at all* about their homophobia and so on.

She\u2019s going to face challenges your sons will not. You need to learn how to support her better than what you\u2019ve suggested here.", "It is an issue. It's a well-known fact that the majority of churches hate the LGBTQIA+ community. Most are quiet with their hate, so do not trust that your church is one of the \"good\" ones. \n\nHave a talk with your daughter. Don't get mad or upset, and don't defend the church. \n\nSit down and listen to her. Hear what she has to say. \n\nIf you are going to completely ignore her feelings about this, then you are a major a**hole.", "If they're inclusive, they'll advertise it. You'd see information in the church bulletin, on social media. And there would be direct mention in sermons.\n\nYour church's silence is loud.", "I find that unless a church is outwardly supportive of LGBTQIA+ (flags, mentioning in sermons, participating in local queer events, etc) then they\u2019re not supportive at all despite what they say in private.", "You have been there for an extremely short time. Let me rephrase that so it makes even more sense: you, a straight person, have been to this organization that is absolutely known for their anti-lgbt stance for an extremely short time. \n\nHow TF do you think you'll know how friendly they are to a queer person? Do they have LGBT pride flags hanging outside? Do they have signs that say they absolutely welcome everyone, INCLUDING THE LGBT, and that God loves everyone too? Do they have signs that say hating the LGBT is wrong? There are several churches in my area that are known to support the LGBT and have made that obvious by making everyone can see their support. Or, does this church make absolutely no commitment on the LGBT so people would have to face this discrimination before you know or still have to guess the church's stance (one that statistically is against LGBT)?", "If that's what you'd like to believe, that's your prerogative.  I think your one off is a minority exception", "Maybe you can look up some other types of groups. I was in youth and government through the YMCA in high school, so that could be something she can do. You can also look into some clubs or things that center around her interests. She doesn\u2019t have to join the youth group to be more social", "That\u2019s a rough one to deal with in a standard school setting. Have you looked into seeing if there is a homeschooling group that gets together? I used to teach in a large-ish town and they had this set up for students on campuses or in libraries. It\u2019s kind of like a study group or a club. It\u2019d be the same as what you want her to do, but without the religious aspect.", "Sounds like you need to find a better specialist to treat your daughter, then, because it is possible to control the symptoms well enough for her to live a fairly normal life. And teaching her to manage her illness safely now is key to helping her grow into a self-sufficient adult.\n\nShe might benefit from an IEP, which would include a safety plan for your daughter, like what physical activities are safe for her, having a buddy to walk with her in case of a sudden dizzy spell, what to do if she has an episode at school, etc.", "As someone that\u2019s currently being tested for M\u00e9ni\u00e8re\u2019s disease, I truly empathize with your daughter. But yea, unless the church is openly pro lgbtq, this is not the right place for her to socialize.", "You do realize that the \"brutally honest\" part of this statement makes it sound like you believe that more accepting churches are actually just lying/sugarcoating/too weak to stand in their secret hateful convictions, right?", "OP explained why she is homeschooled, and if it\u2019s true, it is 100% reasonable to homeschool her for health concerns. I have an autoimmune issue and used to faint, etc. Being at school was scary for me because I had no control. I can support why she homeschools her if this is true.", "Can confirm. My ex and his brother were homeschooled because their mother didn't want anyone else influencing them.", "You phrased this perfectly. OP is very much TA.", "Not even just that she's going to burn in hellfire. Which actively teaches that your daughter is a danger to other children both spiritually and as a predator and that if she had her own children would be condemning them. Girls identifying as bi or lesbians or asexual have been assaulted by religious boys who have been indoctrinated with the belief that they are just afraid of masculinity and need to get over themselves. You would be putting your child in danger and she lacks even the safety net of an existing friend group. You are ignorant or you want her punished for not behaving the way you want which is evil.", ">the church has been nothing less than kind to me and my sons and I doubt they'd be any different to her.\n\nExactly, this is the rallying cry of the privileged right here! ... \"If I as a \\[member of the dominant culture\\] have never been targeted by \\[institution who openly targets a marginalized group\\], then I don't see why they would treat \\[member of the marginalized group\\] any different, they're lovely people!\"", "It\u2019s subscribe, not ascribe jsyk. The evangelical church, which *subscribes* to a homophobic worldview, *ascribes* homophobic labels to LGBT people.", "Perfectly put.", "Makes me think this can't be real. This sub is opening my mind to how unbelievably dense some people are, assuming these tales are truthful.", "Mine was like that too, we got to a point we're we'd spend most Wednesdays crying and babbling in tongues and it got weird. Turns out adult men leading groups of teens doesn't usually end well", "Flirting for converting! Also a policy at a youth group I was on the fringes of.", "It really doesn't.\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Christian_denominations_affirming_LGBT_people?wprov=sfla1", "You\u2019re literally doing the same thing right now.", "When those groups are attempting to take over the government and enact horrific anti LGBTQ legislation, maybe I don\u2019t give a fuck if you\u2019re offended on their behalf", "The pastor is trying to figure out how much to shun OP for assorting with/raising one of \u201cthose people\u201d", "Also I vote NTA for suggesting she attend the youth group but don't push her anymore. I suggest talking to the Pastor about their position on LGBT people because if this church is very against your daughter's sexuality, it will cause real problems for your family.", "I agree with this. Also if it\u2019s not brought up you have no idea if they have positive views or negative views. In my experience, churches (small local ones normally) that have positive views tend to be very open about it. The two I personally knew people from flew pride flags outside and had it all over their website. Wouldn\u2019t trust a church to be kind towards lgbtq+ members without something like this.", "This - I was homeschooled and my mom made sure we were in a variety of groups to be around kids our age. Some were during regular school hours specifically intended for the homeschool community, and some were evening or weekends for anyone - book clubs, music, sports, theatre, scouting, dance, art. We were constantly around other kids our age. There are a ton of options, you just have to look for them.", "That\u2019s not what I meant", "If it\u2019s true, sure.  I just have a feeling that OP isn\u2019t being completely honest.", "And Evangelical Christians are known for taking public health concerns seriously too, so what could possibly be the problem sending her to youth group?\n\n/s", "OP is a member of the exact same group, albeit a na\u00efve one.", "I thought the same. This can't be real.", "Mine was just forcing teens to date susceptible teens and then  ring them i. for game nights until they are hooked then to church to hug the old men and promise all our possessions and then go out and date new teens for the group", "Dude this \"article\" literally lists THREE denominations in all of North America. I'm actually dying you posted this to \"back up your argument.\" And none of those churches are evangelical in the slightest anyways.", "This post is literally proving my point lol", "lol okay, kiddo. Nobody is doing that, but congrats on the brainwashing (:", "I even checked my (much smaller, more rural) current community and they have similar resources as my old town. So they\u2019re definitely there.\n\nIf OP is really worried about her social life, she\u2019ll find one of these resources. If it\u2019s just about religion, well then\u2026", "Okay but that's how it came out. You framed exclusionary behavior as being, at its base, the result of \"honesty\" rather than prejudice or cruelty.", "Yeah, I\u2019m not going to bet on the truthfulness.", "Florida, Tennessee, Texas, Iowa and many other states have passed anti Trans and anti LGBTQ legislation pushed by groups like Alliance Defending Freedom, the Heritage Foundation and other explicitly Christian groups", "Read *The Family*, by Jeff Sharlet. It\u2019s very well sourced and describes exactly that happening.", "I can see that now, but like I said, that wasn\u2019t what I meant so you can stop bothering me about it now please", "lmao what anti-trans laws? I don't agree with the Heritage Foundation but it's super cute you think they are a Christian organization.", "Dude if you didn't mean it that's cool and all, but it's probably a good idea to think about this phrasing for your future attempts to assure queers about the nature of churches. Or I guess I could have not commented and you could have remained blissfully unaware of how shitty it sounded \ud83e\udd37", "Well aren't you just a lovely person", "Just say you hate queer people and move along.", "You\u2019re still pestering me, please stop I\u2019ve had enough", "I noticed you didn't answer the question (:", "Lol thank you for not answering the question either (:", "K", "You know the answer. People have been telling you the answer. This whole thread IS FULL OF PEOPLE WITH ANSWERS. it's not my fault you're too stupid to understand them.", "Sorry if I\u2019m being rude but I don\u2019t appreciate being told more than once after I fix my mistake that I made a mistake, I understood the first time that what I said was wrong and deleted it, only for you to basically repeat 2 more times that what I said sounded wrong and it made me frustrated"]}
