I own a house and have a partner of 6 years that lives with me, her parents have been living on my section in their caravan for approximately the past 8 months while they get \"ready\" to trip around the country. My partners mother has medical depression as do i. The past few days have been a bit rough on me and my medication seemed to just stop working, causing me to be rather depressed and gloomy. I have had this happen before so usually i stick to my self and try not to ruin everyone else's mood. Today an argument ensured between me and my partner because her mum was not happy with my \"attitude\" and \"mood\". I was in my bedroom most of the day avoiding people, partners mother was in my lounge on her phone all day. When the argument ensured, i replied with along the lines of \"i cant help my depression\", \"this is my house, where else can i go?\" and that my partners mother \"should know better as she has depression\". It turned to the point of me telling my partner that i wanted her parents to move on and leave my property. I felt i shouldn't have to deal with this in my house. My partner thinks that i am being immature and unfair because she has to try keep all of us happy and that as they are her parents i should be nice to them for her.

Basically my partner has her own job and she pays part food, utilities and rent, I pay the rest. House is in my name and so is mortage, I had this house before we met. Original agreement was they would be here for a month max while they waited for the last bits for their caravan to arrive, all of which arrived within a week of them arriving here. The ultimatum I made was basically i shouldn't have to deal with this and they are the problem so I want them gone.\n\nHope this gives some insight, im not very good at putting thoughts on paper.", "In what way is it childish to put hard boundaries after people _abused_ your hospitality?", "I don't think it matters over here who pays for or owns the house. Aren't you and your partner in a loving supportive relationship? Clearly you were supportive as parents were staying indefinitely until you threw them out, on the pretext of it being one month.\n\nDepression is hard enough as is, you do have highs and lows. How could your partner be unsupportive about your low?", "No, you\u2019re doing fine. I can empathize with it being hard to get what your head is doing out through your words. It sounds like a failure to set and enforce boundaries to me. \n\nOf course, we only get a small window into your life\u2014but is it possible that you agreed on one thing and, after one extension or another, you\u2019ve ended up frustrated and lashing out more than you would have in context? Not blaming you. But if so, you can\u2019t keep doormatting yourself for their comfort, and you shouldn\u2019t. But they are also allowed to be surprised when you start treating status quo as insufficient. \n\nMaybe sitting down and writing out how you feel invalidated in your own home and having points you want a address, then sitting down with your partner and insisting on coming to a plan of action in order to entertain their parent\u2019s continued imposition could be a first step to try?", "Wait... you have to pay for the parents ?"]}
