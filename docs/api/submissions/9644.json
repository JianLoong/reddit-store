{"id": 9644, "submission_id": "10z0gfa", "title": "AITA for giving the silent treatment to my parents over jam?", "selftext": "Every year my family has a tradition of going up North to our shared cottage with my extended family. My great aunt makes an amazing strawberry rhubarb jam. It\u2019s unlike no other I\u2019ve ever had. No store bought jam can even compare to this, that\u2019s how good it is. But I only get it when I go up north, once a year. \n\nFor my 21st birthday I asked for a jar of it from my Grandfather. He obliged and got me my very own jar. He put a sticky note with my name on the jar, it stayed on there for about a month til I decided to take it off because it was getting dirty. Everyone in my household knew it was mine. They know it\u2019s my favorite thing in the whole wide world. Today I was going to eat the last little bit when I woke up to find a completely empty jar sitting on the counter. I was livid. The ONLY thing I got for my birthday. My favorite thing in the whole world. And this wasn\u2019t the first time. My grandma made me my favorite cookies right around my 21st birthday too. I ate about 3, there had to have been around 30 of them. Next day, gone.\n\nI angrily texted my family\u2019s group chat where my father told me it was, \u201cno big deal.\u201d And I\u2019m, \u201coverreacting.\u201d And he said I deserved it since I didn\u2019t put my name on it. Everyone in my household is an adult. So I\u2019ve decided to give them all, except my sister because she had nothing to do with it, the silent treatment til they put another jar in my hand.\n\nMy boyfriend is saying I\u2019m being a bit harsh with them. My dad says I\u2019m overreacting and I need to get over it. But it\u2019s not like I can go to the store and buy another. I\u2019m tired of them constantly disrespecting me. I shouldn\u2019t need to label my food, we\u2019re all adults. If I tell you once, you should know to back off. AITA?\n\nEDIT: Getting a lot of miscommunication here. My family, all of them, **KNEW** the jar was mine. And that it was a birthday gift only for me. They were 10000% aware. And they also know I am a person who needs permission. If you want to borrow my shirt, ask me first. I\u2019ve told them this multiple times too.\n\nEDIT 2: I think I\u2019m having an emotional breakdown over this. This jam isn\u2019t just special to me, it\u2019s sentimental. I had a cousin who was 19 pass away 10 month ago, he was like a brother to me. His favorite thing was this jam. We would fight over it as kids. Every time I eat it, it reminds me of him. This is a big reason why I\u2019m so upset over it.", "created_utc": 1676056973, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/10z0gfa/aita_for_giving_the_silent_treatment_to_my/", "score": 48, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You live with adults, they can behave like it. The onus should not be on you to turn your whole life upside down because your family can't behave like decent human beings who weren't raised in a cave.

I'm just a stranger on the internet. However, I find it telling that your boyfriend thinks you're being harsh. A BF is normally inclined to be on his GF's side, so since your BF (knowing all the players better than I ever could) thinks you're being too harsh, I think that's a decent indication that you are being too harsh.\n\nNot so fun fact: my childhood best friend had an argument with her father and didn't talk to him for the last month before his sudden death (we were 22; he was 52, and a nice man and good father).

If the label came off, the adult thing to do is put a new label on it. If you are an adult you can get your own mini frig or as an adult get your own place to live. Being an adult means communicating like an adult. None of what you describe is the behaviour of an adult. It's quite childish.", "ESH. If it was so empty that there was maybe one serving left, it probably looked like trash tbh. Maybe they were trying to clear out the fridge.

I don't believe that family has to label things in order to be courteous when they're sharing a space. So there was an AH move by your Dad there, and you're not an AH for being hurt about that.\n\nHowever, you're rubbing people the wrong way with your wording at the end about the silent treatment until they 'put another jar in your hand.'

I can barely fit my desk chair in there.", "It was. Until it got dirty, but it was on there for a month or two.", "Yeah. It\u2019s not like this jam is an unknown substance to them. My aunt makes it every year for our vacation, for the past **25-30 years.** They know how crazy I am over this stuff.", "It was a punch in the gut to go through the trouble of savoring every bit of it just to have someone else eat it, when it wasn\u2019t even theirs to begin with.", "lots of people live at home while they are in college", "Yeah and how much debt do most people have?", "You americans have some weird obssesion with moving out of your parents homes. In my country (and I guess most of Europe) like 70% of collage students still lives at home. It's amazing how pathological is your system.", "Ok buddy", "Personally I hate rhubarb and dug halfway through the earth to dig it out. But that's why store bought jam is disappointing. They use all the fruit that gets picked, ripe or not.  Keep trying and take notes. You can do it!", "I'm sure. And, you got some feedback. Some was useful, some wasn't. Just ignore the useless stuff. Maybe you could talk to your parents in person about how the incident made you feel and why the jam was so important. It might not change their behavior, but it will mean that you have fulfilled your obligations to healthy communication.", "Those aren't your only two options, you know. Look, NTA for being upset, but the silent treatment is not the way to get your point across because all that does is make people think you're immature and selfish, and that you're having a fit like a child (must like flipping over furniture in a fit of rage).", "Sucking it up and realizing a teaspoon of jam isn't worth either.", "It did belong to you. But people can buy and possess food and also expect there to be a reasonable amount of sharing, especially over something like jam.\n\nIt seems like you have made an assumption without explicitly communicating your expectations, and in reality the rest of the family was not on the same page.", "Yeah, you just plain crazy.", "It *was* and then you took it off without replacing it. This is on you. You obviously understood the purpose of labeling your food, so why didn't you keep it labeled?", "Exactly. I\u2019m not ashamed I\u2019m being financially responsible in my early 20s. I plan on moving out, and to move out is it save money.", "Not common where I\u2018m from (Germany). Just looked it up: Less than 25% of all students live at home. In 20 of 29 European countries more than 50% of students don\u2019t live at home:\n\nhttps://www.eurostudent.eu/download_files/documents/EV_Kurzdossier_Wohnen.pdf\n\nIn German but the graphs are easy enough to understand.", "Yeah it is a very American thing or more specifically very common in my state and the college i go to", "Oh goodness you really need to try making strawberry rhubarb jam!! Takes that nasty bitter taste right out of the rhubarb. It\u2019s the best tasting jam I\u2019ve ever had.", "I shut down when I\u2019m really upset. I don\u2019t cry or scream, I just shut down. I stop talking, and leave the room. It\u2019s my natural emotional response. When people call me childish for giving the silent treatment, it\u2019s really just me being so upset and hurt that I can\u2019t bring myself to talk to them until they right their wrongs.", "I\u2019ve sucked it up about 100 times in the past. I\u2019m done sucking it up.", "No, no I did explicitly state it was mine. And it was not to be eaten without my consent.", "Why do I need to keep it labeled. I don\u2019t live with cavemen. We\u2019re all adults. If I told them **no, don\u2019t eat this,** it means **no, don\u2019t eat this.**", "You're not wrong for being upset. And there's nothing wrong with walking away when you're angry. But don't stay silent. When you can rationally and peacefully explain why you're angry, do that. The lack of respect they're showing is so rude, but don't amp up the rude in the house with the silent treatment. They knew that was yours, but I guess when you took your name off of it, they thought, what? That meant you were done & didn't want it any more? Not cool. When you can talk about it without anger, please do. Offer alternatives, like labels for special foods for everyone if there's a specific food that's a gift, or a lock box for special treats, or a mini-fridge for your room. If you charge at them with anger, justified or not, they'll be on the defensive and less likely to listen or take you seriously.", "Well, then you NTA", "Lol...maybe you really DO live with cavemen! \ud83e\udd23", "It had been there a while, and then you took off the label, it unconsciously (and perhaps perceived graciously) opened it to everyone. It\u2019s a mistake on everyone\u2019s part, but not worth destroying everything over it.", "Holy shit, you're in for a miserable adult life if this remains your attitude. Just label your food when you put it in a shared fridge.  It's a simple thing you can do to keep people from eating it. \n\nMaybe your opinion is you shouldn't have to, but the fact is you do. Not a hill you need to die on.", "I think I\u2019m going to take another commenters advice and explain to them why what they did sucks.", "I\u2019m starting to consider it. The amount of messes they all make really makes me wonder.", "I can see your point there. I guess my mistake was assuming they had more than two brain cells.", "I think you need a class on consent. Yikes\u2026", "It's so frustrating isn't it. But your cavemen comment cracked me up. Just label your stuff from now on. Some folks think family =no boundaries necessary. When actually, that's with whom you need them the most!", "Yeah, I guess I made the mistake of assuming that they had more than two brain cells"]}
