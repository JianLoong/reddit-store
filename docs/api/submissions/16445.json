Their house is infested with roaches and it\u2019s really normal to see them just crawling along the coffee table while you\u2019re watching TV or even crawling at the dinner table while you\u2019re trying to eat. I have never judged where he came from and my husband is a really clean person in our home, but the issue of staying the night at his family\u2019s house always comes up. We moved out of state for the military, so this problem is not one we come across often. However, every time we visit, he wants us to stay with his family. \n\nI have stayed there a few times before because I love my husband and wanted to show him that. Then I got pregnant. While I was pregnant, we went to visit them and I stayed the night. I woke up with mouse poop on my clothes from the bedding. The next day while eating dinner with all of his family sat around the big table, a roach crawled onto me from the table. I let out a little scream and everyone looked at me like I was insane. My husband thinks I was being really dramatic about this. I did not intend to scream (as I did not want to make his family feel bad) but it was the last thing I was expecting while eating dinner and I\u2019m really scared of roaches.\n\nMy husband and I have had private conservations since about how I\u2019m not comfortable with sleeping there, and I would not want our now 7 month old daughter staying the night there either. He called me a stuck up snob. It\u2019s a really delicate situation and I feel like there\u2019s no nice way to say that I feel nasty being there. When we\u2019ve talked about it, my husband says if that\u2019s how I feel I can be the one to tell his family and I can see what they think of me then. So obviously that isn\u2019t happening. \n\nI don\u2019t want to disrespect his parents and family, but I\u2019m not comfortable sleeping in those conditions. Or really even being in the house, but that is something I\u2019ll compromise on. I feel like my husband should realize it isn\u2019t normal to grow up that way and agree to get a hotel or stay with my family instead. \n\nI also think he should be the one that says we\u2019re going to stay a hotel or something (doesn\u2019t even have to mention why). I think it\u2019s unfair of him to force that onto me to tell his family something hurtful or else we\u2019re just going to have to sleep there. AITA?\n\nEDITED TO ADD: His parents both immigrated from Mexico where they lived in conditions like this. So they don\u2019t see anything wrong with it either. And that is also how my husband justifies it\u2026. \u201cThey grew up that way. When I was in Mexico visiting my grandparents they lived like this too and I still had a great time. Nothing bad happened to me. I\u2019m still alive, so our daughter would be fine\u201d\u2026. My husband says it\u2019s normal for poor people to live like that, but I don\u2019t think money determines living in filth or not.

I slept on floor palettes as well on top of floors made of dirt, and they were the most cleanest homes.\n\nSounds like his family likes living as pigs, and he's accepted it as he grew up in the filth. This is far from normal home. Your daughter should not be subjected to being exposed to roaches as they have been found to contribute to asthma. Mice also carry diseases. \n\nStay at a hotel or your family's home. It is his place to tell his family, not yours. He's simply trying to get you to bend to his will.\n\nNTA", "Lol you\u2019re a snob because you don\u2019t like living in unhygienic surroundings. Give me a break. NTA.", "NTA. Personally I wouldn't take my child or myself into that situation. Being in that house can cause respiratory issues including asthma, not to mention all the other illnesses and diseases. If your husband loves you and your child he will not force this.\n\nSome reading on how roach infestation affects health.\nhttps://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/what-to-know-cockroaches-health\n\nAnd one for rodents. https://www.cdc.gov/healthypets/pets/wildlife/rodent-control.html", "NTA. Your husband sees nothing wrong with this situation because it's how he grew up. But surely, as an adult, he must realize how unsanitary it is and definitely not the norm. I'm sure he's lashing out because when you say you don't want to stay there anymore (and definitely don't want your child staying there) he thinks you're saying his family is shameful and so was his upbringing. Of course that isn't true but that doesn't mean you're being stuck up. If anything, I think your husband and his family would benefit from therapy.\n\nHowever, this isn't a situation that's up for debate. That house is so unsanitary it's dangerous. No one should be visiting it let alone living in it. And in no way should you be bringing your child there. Put your foot down on this one. If he lashes out, don't dance around it. Tell him you aren't trying to insult him or insinuate his family are bad people, but the facts are that any house riddled with mice and cockroaches is unsanitary and dangerous and you will not risk your safety or your daughter's safety by staying there.\n\nEdit: Based on your edit, I might encourage your husband to go to couple's counseling with you and/or watch episodes of Hoarders and/or have him talk to your daughter's pediatrician with you. You're correct that just because people are poor doesn't mean they must live in squalor. Just because he's okay doesn't mean it's a safe environment. It's like surviving to adulthood despite never wearing a seatbelt. Just because you haven't been jettisoned through a windshield yet doesn't mean it's safe. If he doesn't believe you, it might do some good to have a third party/professional tell him.", "NTA And your husband has unrealistic expectations. That's probably due to suppressed shame. Since he grew up under the same conditions, admitting that it's not hygienic and there is a \"problem\" could drive him into an emotional crisis. \n\nSo it's easier and less painful for him to live in denial and blame you in order to protect his illusion. He probably also wants to protect his parents since their way of living is a sign of mental and emotional instability. \n\nI totally advice you see a therapist on that matter. He is stuck in his own reality and doesn't realize his denial harms you and the baby. Having mice and roaches crawl over you can be really scary and damaging for kids, so this is no joke imo. \n\nAlso it is just ridiculous to pretend that hoarding was just a livestyle and you had to just deal with it. Hoarding is a symptom of OCD and eyerone who helps to justify dysfunctional behaviour is somehow codependent and part of the problem.", "NTA. Your husband\u2019s childhood issues should not override the health and safety of your child.\n\nBook a hotel. However, in this situation, a little white lie is more socially appropriate and kind than saying \u201cyour home is too dirty\u201d.\n\nSay the baby is going though a fussy phase, screams through the night, and you\u2019d hate to disrupt their sleep.\n \nA good excuse may also warm your husband up to staying elsewhere, as he won\u2019t have to deal with the family fallout caused by either of you criticising his parents hygiene.\n\nAlso - does your husband have siblings with SOs? How do they feel about the situation?", "NTA. When your family visits your in-laws, get a hotel room for yourself and the baby. Don't ask your husband for permission. Don't discuss it with him. Just tell him you're doing it, and do it.\n\nDo not eat meals there. Just leave at meal times. You should not be eating in a place where vermin are clearly present. Nearly all restaurants have pests, but if a customer sees them or evidence of them you know that the problem is really bad. The same applies to a home.\n\nIf your husband pitches a fit, tell him that you can always stay home and he can go on his own.\n\nIf your in-laws confront you about it, just be honest and as tactful as possible: \"Your home is not clean enough for me to sleep or eat here.\"\n\nIf they say you're too fussy, tell them, \"I might be, but that's how it is.\"", "My comment is too far down, but I sure hope you see it.\n\nYour daughter\u2019s pediatrician should be the one to have this conversation with your husband. Mice and cockroaches carry disease and there is no way your baby should be put at risk.\n\nYour husband can claim all he wants that nothing bad happened to him, but I\u2019d be willing to bet he had more than his fair share of colds, allergies, headaches and breathing problems growing up in filth. And God knows what else. He may have been conditioned to think it was normal, but you know better.\n\nAs far as this is the way poor people or people from Mexico live, your husband is full of shit. The majority of poor people and people from Mexico have the same high sanitary standards as any other group. But like every other group you\u2019ll always find a few slobs or some who suffer from the mental illness that is hoarding.\n\nYou can feel for them without sacrificing the health of your child.\n\nDo not compromise on this. Make an appointment with the doctor and be brutally honest about the living conditions.\n\nNTA", "NTA.\n\n99.99% of people would not want to sleep there, much less visit.\n\nPlus, you want to bring home roach eggs and mice poop/dander in your luggage???\n\nYour husband needs a reality check.  It is very reasonable to stay at a nearby hotel and just do things not at their house unless it is cleaned up.   TBH, I know this might cause a fight with him, but he also can't make you go to their house to visit unless you are amenable to that.  You have to draw the line somewhere for your own sanity.\n\nIt is also usual practice for spouses to talk to their own family when it comes to communication about sensitive topics.", ">He called me a stuck up snob.\n\nYes, it's *super* stuck-up to not want animals and bugs crawling on you and your baby. /s\n\nAnd if Husband feels living that way is so normal and won't harm your baby, why is he clean at home??", "NTA\n\n>my husband is a really clean person in our home\n\nSo even HE doesnt like living like that. Even HE knows to keep things clean despite growing up like that. If he really was okay with it then he would live that way too. \n\nKnowing they grew up that way breeds understanding. But it does not become an excuse for dismissing what is not okay.  I grew up getting the dickons taken out of me. But despite that being \"how I grew up\" I DO NOT do that to my child. If its unclean and unsafe then your child shouldnt be there. Its fact not rudeness.", "Pest control tech here. Roaches and mice are very unsanitary and bad for your health. Mice poo is bad to breathe in, if you don't have breathing problems, they can cause breathing problems, or make a breathing problem worse. So now, he wants you to bring a baby who's lungs and immune system is underdeveloped, into this soup of unsanitary chaos. No!!!! By the way, being poor has nothing to do with being clean. If he wants to see his family, so be it. Doesn't mean you and tiny have to go. Advocate for your baby, they're helpless. Let him be mad. So. And if he goes by himself, tell him he has to strip at the door, so the clothes can immediately go to the washer. If he wants you to tell his parents, tell them, baby is not visiting while there is a bug and mice infestation. So. I'm rooting for you, you got this!

I'd be very concerned for any health implications that result from staying there.", "NTA\n\nJust tell the family that the baby is loud and wakes up at night and you feel super uncomfortable at the idea of disturbing their sleep. Stay at a hotel. Staying in those conditions with a baby would be irresponsible.", "NTA - Who in their right minds thinks that a mother \"owes\" possession of a baby to anyone? If your in-laws want a baby sleeping in their house, they should get one of their own, this one is yours.

I would seriously be questioning your husband's judgement.", "NTA. There are different standards of cleanliness but this is quite extreme. Mouse poop is a reasonable deal breaker (and I agree that it should be deal breaker for a pregnant woman or a new born). Also, any bad news should be communicated to inlaws by the related party.

I certainly wouldn't and no way would I be able to even touch their bedding let alone sleep in it. You are very tough. \n\n\nYour husband needs to get a grip. This situation is not normal and it's not ok. Poor shouldn't equal filth (and in this case I'm sure the hoarding is the issue, not the finances). They are choosing to let roaches and mice infest their house. Your baby could get bitten. Your baby could get sick. Absolutely no way should you be having a baby in that environment.

Conversely, our bodies develop micro biomes and immune systems based on what we are exposed to, so, while not necessarily *wrong*, different hygiene standards impact people differently from a biological perspective. Regardless of this reality, it\u2019s a very difficult balance to maintain one\u2019s health without it being considered rude, especially because these scenarios almost always involve unequal levels of privilege.\n\nMy have personal experience with this struggle is mostly related to food, as my partner is from Central America and I\u2019m a white girl with a sensitive digestive system that was raised on Canadian food safe standards. \n\nIt has taken my partner awhile to understand that my concerns with eating certain meals when visiting family are not about being judgmental, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with him eating anything he wants, but things like cooked meat being left covered but in the counter for two days and then reheated to use in meals is something that has repeatedly made me very sick.\n\nWe are both very concerned about how this could appear to his family, especially considering they often make an effort to include foods that I\u2019d be comfortable with, but because they don\u2019t adjust their food handling practices, I still can\u2019t eat it. The way we navigate it is that I keep my mouth shut or speak to him privately, and he pays extra attention to what he sees going on in the kitchen, then he sneaks things off my plate, makes excuses, and sneaks out to grab me alternative food that I eat in secret. \n\nThe key to this is that he trusts that I love his family and would never want to hurt them, and also that I know my body and he doesn\u2019t want me to be sick or make me feel like my safety doesn\u2019t matter to him. \n\nI\u2019m not going to speak on the hygiene standards at your in-laws place, because that\u2019s not my place. Regardless of whether the environment is appropriately safe for anyone, it could definitely have a detrimental impact to someone who is not accustomed to it, and even more so for a young child unaccustomed to it.\n\nI\u2019d recommend that the conversations you have with your husband stay away from how you feel when you are there, and more on the health risks to yourself and your child.

People who get travellers diarrhea aren\u2019t being socially judgmental about the standards, their bodies are being biologically judgemental. \n\nIt also might be worth discussing with your paediatrician, but I strongly recommend that you only do so *with* your husband and with the goal of *both* of you learning what boundaries are appropriate for your child\u2019s health.

NTA, but I'm leaning toward saying OP WOULD be an a h to put her baby's health in jeopardy by continuing to visit and stay there.", "Also think about hepatitis. My dad was unhygienic like that and he had hepatitis. Surprisingly and luckily we didn't. We could have gotten it from him.", "This is horrifying and absolutely nauseating. That poor baby. Thank you for sharing, as OP hopefully can pass this info on to husband so he understands the health risks.", "I've been a pediatric home care nurse for over 30 years. I wish I could say that was an isolated incident but it's not.", "Oh that's so horrible. I hope that child went to a good foster home.", "Fellow city kid here, and yeah, roaches are hated. Most buildings have aggressive roach control, but all it takes is one person in the building to be gross, and those fuckers start spawning and spreading. If one is spotted, the process is usually shrieks, thrown shoes, and an angry call to maintenance. Followed by a lot of cursing, purchasing roach motel traps, and resealing every potential point of access.", "[removed]", "> You can be poor and still be clean.\n\nThank you. This has nothing to do with poverty and everything to do with being slovenly. You don\u2019t have to be wealthy to buy and use a damn broom or mop. I grew up as a welfare baby, somehow never lived with cockroaches and mouse feces.\n\nHusband needs some serious therapy.", "Love seeing Pratchett references.", "I mean living in an apartment roaches (and the odd mouse, I suppose) are pretty common. Doubly so if you have messy neighbors. \n\nHowever, there is plenty you can do to mitigate them including keeping clean and less cluttered, reducing improperly stored food, and spraying occasionally and cleaning and reorganizing areas they might congregate. \n\nIf it was just a few here or there and the house was otherwise kept tidy? I would get the husband\u2019s point here. The current conditions sound like a horror movie though\u2026", "IGR \u201cmotels\u201d will keep most roaches out of a home and they aren\u2019t hugely expensive.", "This is a great idea, I would do this for sure", "I was offended on your behalf.\n\nWhat a load of crap.", "Oh yes it can! Baby is fussing and being difficult about feedings, she just had to eat between nursing times, or she won't produce enough milk for the baby. And of course, making sure the baby is well fed is priority one, even if that means she has to sacrifice eating at normal mealtimes. She'll likely get some unsolicited advice about increasing milk production, but that's OK. Smile, nod, and run with it.", "Just read about this from Ca public health - ugh so gross. They suggest you bleach the poop and not vacuum sweep it because you can inhale it. So gross", "Having had hantavirus contracted from an unusual set of circumstances (never allow pet rodents to breed with their wild relatives - I didn't but there were chain of custody issues) I completely agree.", "I guess it's less likely because it's more common in warmer climates, but leptospirosis is really bad and you can get it not only from contact with mouse urine, but also contact with water, food, and even soil that touched the urine.", "I will add spraying Bengal (best roach killer and repellant ever) until I can barely see through the fog.  Also balancing the dead roach on a flyswatter to get it outside, cause yea, I ain't touching that even with a paper towel.", "u/Puzzleheaded_End250 is a bot.", "Hantavirus is super serious and can lead to an incurable respiratory disease (assuming OP is in North America; \u201cOld World\u201d hantavirus can lead to hemorrhagic fever instead).", "Salmonella, too"]}
