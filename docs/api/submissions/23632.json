I was clearly living off his money to fund my lifestyle and I have no idea how hard it is for him and his other baby mum who are in debt and struggling because she doesn\u2019t work.

May I also remind you that I was the breadwinner in our marriage and as my husband works as well, we are in a comfortable position. \n\nI\u2019m not sure why you are so angry that your children you see for 8 hours a month are given opportunities, as I pay for nursery if I were to not send them for the summer, i would still have to pay. Our oldest asked to go to camp because his friends are going. Your money goes into a saving account for the children. I never chased you for the money owed from when you didn\u2019t pay either.

You are a good mother, apparently able to maintain a relationship (seeing as you have a husband who cares enough to help to send your kids to private school etc..) and you were able to support yourself and your kids through 10 months of no support from your ex so I would assume you are also moderately successful and self-sufficient... and he throws that away just like that, and makes twins which he struggles to support. That's incredibly stupid of him and I hope your kids take after you in the IQ department.\n\nThat being said, in the first place ideally summer camp should be a place the kids enjoy, that should be the most important part. So if they want to go and enjoy themselves why would anybody in their right mind prevent them from doing so if there are means to pay for it?  It is in no way lazy parenting, they will socialize and spend more time in the outdoors which is both great for them. Even if you had used the child support, which you didn't, but if you had he has no right to complain since it is child support - aka meant for the child's expenses.\n\nNTA\n\nP.s. his marital problems have nothing to do with you anymore", "NTA. You sent your kid to camp because they wanted to go. Ex responded as though they went to camp every week, all summer. Some kids do.\n\nEx is upset about your child support but should've thought about that before stepping out on you. \n\nTell his mom that he should've thought about you and your kids before having an affair. You have no responsibility to his other kids.", "NTA. Good serve of home truths there. What a loser. He cheated then knocked her up with twins and she doesn\u2019t work. That\u2019s the consequences of their actions. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re making him pay child support. He should be so lucky your husband is paying for their private schooling with you. Camp is good, it allows the kids to have fun together in holidays and develop social skills and it\u2019s AOK for parents to have that break from kids too.\n\nIt\u2019s also a massive joke he sees them once a month total deadbeat who abandoned his family to make another one.", "NTA. Your ex's hypocrisy is astounding. He can't be absent from his children's lives, only seeing them for 8 hours a month, and then have the audacity to criticize your parenting choices.", "NTA. Sounds like they want to go so I see no issue. I care about what the kids think, couldn't care less about the ex's opinion.", "How you spend your money is none of his business. This includes the court ordered child support.  He can talk to a lawyer who will tell him the same. \n\nIf he can\u2019t handle the drop offs without berating you about your financial decisions maybe someone else needs to do the drop offs or they need to happen at a public place.", "NTA and how fucking dares he AND his mom. Kinda uncalled for? You know what\u2019s uncalled for? Cheating on you. Disappearing on his children. Paying for his children only when literally forced. \n\nAlso, I don\u2019t know how\u2019s the summer camp your children go to, but I spent all my summers at camps during my childhood and it was a blast. You\u2019re not less because you\u2019re sending them to have fun!", "NTA. He's just jealous of your lifestyle.", "NTA\n\nYou are using your own money on your own children. Sounds like he needs his mistress to step up a bit.", "NTA, you did nothing wrong pointing out his mistakes. He shouldn\u2019t have commented on something he knew nothing about if he wasn\u2019t ready to have scrutiny pointed back at his own self.", "NTA\n\nGood for you, let him know his place.", "NTA, sending your kids to summer camps isn't a bad thing", "NTA.
