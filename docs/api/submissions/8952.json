My brother and I have never been close due to the age difference, our parents had me young, and then him later in life. He was always the spoiled one who got whatever he wanted. We see each other on holidays and special occasions, but other than that we might talk on the phone once or twice a month.\n\n  \nLast night I had to work late and could not be reached by phone. When I got off, I noticed that I had 2 missed calls from my brother and a few from my wife, but it was already close to 11pm so I chose to just drive home and not call and possibly wake someone up.\n\n  \nI walk into the house and see my wife (41F) and brother on the couch playing Mario Kart. When I walk in they both say Hi and go back to their game. I went to the bedroom to shower and frankly, just sleep... I was exhausted. My wife comes in a few minutes later, and I ask her why my brother was there.\n\n  \nShe said, he called her because he and his girlfriend had gotten into a pretty heated argument, and he just needed to get away from the situation for a little while, while he figured out what he was going to do. They only have one car, and it's in the girlfriend's name so he couldn't take it.  \nApparently, he tried to call me and when I didn't answer, he called her and she went and picked him up an hour away, even though she hates driving at night. They also went out to dinner before coming home.\n\n  \nI told her that I find it odd that she would pick up my brother and take him to dinner, just because he got into an argument with his girlfriend. That he is an adult and needed to work it out.  \nShe just rolled her eyes at me and said he would be staying in the spare room as long as he needed, that I was acting weird, and that he is my brother and has no idea why it was such a huge deal that he was here.\n\n  \nI told her that if someone is staying at my house, especially MY family, I should be the one who decides that. That he had no right to call her; that he should have waited for me to call him back, and would be talking to him in the morning. She told me to deal with it and grow up, that he was always welcome here.\n\n  \nMy wife is now mad at me and I am stuck with my brother in the house for who knows how long until he figures out his life. We already have two teens. I don't need another kid here! \n\nI stand by what I said, my brother doesn't need to be here, but my wife is still mad at me today.

Very very soft YTA, I mean I don\u2019t even think anyone\u2019s really an \u201casshole\u201d here, and I sympathize with you because I myself just had a nightmare experience being kind of shoehorned into letting someone crash at my place. I highly recommend shutting it down before it gets out of hand. On the other hand though, it seems like one or two nights wouldn\u2019t be such a big deal as long as you\u2019re firm on the expectations and time period. I don\u2019t get the impression from your post that your wife or brother deliberately went around you, they tried to contact you and then when they couldn\u2019t reach you, made an executive decision since this was a time-sensitive thing. So I get your frustration I really do, but it just doesn\u2019t seem like they meant any harm or offense. It\u2019s definitely your right to set boundaries in your own home though, so idk that any decision you make here is necessarily \u201cwrong.\u201d All the same I figure you\u2019d probably avoid a whole lot of drama by just letting giving the guy one more night (FIRM, no extensions) to figure out his next move (surely he can use that time to find a friend or other relative to crash with next if he still needs time away). That\u2019s probably what I\u2019d do in your shoes personally. I\u2019m a fan of diplomatic solutions. It can be tricky business though", "YTA he's an adult then he's a kid? Make up your mind. You were unavailable. He needed help. Nothing weird about that. Long term staying in the house yeah yall should discuss but a night or two you weren't reachable and it happened. You sound like a terrible brother.", "It is a decision that should be made together.  But if you have the room & your brother needs help, as long as he's not a dead beat, I don't see the problem.", "YTA, but it will be a life lesson for why your children do not visit you later in life", "YTA. Bro you are 40 years old, instead of being insistent about making decisions for \"YOUR family\", why not learn to care about your family instead? Your brother is going through a tough time, your wife is just trying to be nice. Why are you making this about yourself?", "Yeah dude way to help out family. And trust your wife! YTA all the way. What\u2019s your hang up here? Whatever it is, it\u2019s weird. Get over it.", "Your wife treats your little brother like a younger sibling or a nephew. She seems to recognize that while he is an adult, at 20 years old he's not fully mature, so she is giving him a safe place to work out what his options are. \n\nYou talk about your brother like a pesky neighbor kid that has no connection to you. Maybe think about who your resentment should be directed toward (your parents) instead of being grumpy with your wife and brother. \n\nBetween the two of you, I'd choose your wife. She's showing empathy for a young man who needed help while you are just complaining about an extra body in your house (which apparently has the extra room), without offering any practical solutions to the situation.\n\nSure, you have the right to say who can stay in your house, but so does your wife. If you don't want him to stay, then help him figure out a solution that works for everyone. \n\nIt's not clear if this was an emergency, but the number of calls you received suggest to me that it was at least a very urgent problem that had to be addressed immediately. \"Heated argument\" might mean that your brother or his girlfriend were not safe to be in the same place. Is your brother being abused? Was he so upset that he didn't feel in control of himself? Seems like maybe you should think about how you would answer a call like this from your own child or a dear friend. How would it be different from your reaction to it being your brother in a tough spot? Maybe you should do some self-reflection.\n\nYTA", "YTA for this statement: I told her that if someone is staying at my house, especially MY family, I should be the one who decides that.\n\nSo by this logic her family can stay as long as she wants them to? And you're the only one who get a say?", "ESH . \n\nShe's not the AH for helping someone out. Even though he's \"your brother,\" he isn't \"yours\" like a possession.  What if a female friend had called her and said \"I had a really bad fight with my boyfriend and I'm not comfortable being at home right now?\n\n\nYou also have absolutely no right to police who your wife goes to dinner with. \n\n\n When you say he's an adult and needs to work it out....guess what, sometimes adults work things out by asking people they are close to for help. Being an adult doesn't mean you don't need support. Also, you later call him a kid. So he shouldn't need help because he's an adult and you don't want to deal with helping a kid.\n\n\n\nYour wife shouldn't be saying that he should stay as long as he wants to. There are 4 people living in your house, presumably 2 that contribute to bills, and she can't make unilateral decisions. You're right that he needs to figure things out and can't rely on you indefinitely, but a few days of support and kindness should be okay.", "YTA thought, at the end, you were going to be a hero,... zero. Then you wonder why divorce is in mind. SMH", "YTA your brother didn't get to decide how he was raised so stop blaming him! He's a young guy that turned to his brother for help and guidance when he couldn't reach you he went to his SISTER in law for the same help and guidance. Aren't you family? \n\nJust like your wife said \"grow up\"!", "YTA - Your wife is being an incredible sister. Something happened and your bother was so upset he reached out to you and wanted to ask to stay with you an hour away. He\u2019s 20 which while, not a child, isn\u2019t a 39 year old adult. You weren\u2019t available and she stepped in (without knowing how you felt) and did the sweetest and safest thing for your brother. Sure if you had told him no, and he tried to get around you to your wife that\u2019d be one thing, but your wife certainly didnt do anything wrong by not being able to read your mind. Maybe next time she\u2019ll remember that you don\u2019t like caring for your brother, but i think its incredible that she did. You need to lighten up on him because it comes off as just jealousy for something he can\u2019t help (being born at a later time).", "You are definitely the asshole here or are leaving out a ton of info\n\nYeah you have some minor points (I don\u2019t like people staying at my house either) but it isn\u2019t just your house and it\u2019s family and you didn\u2019t specify that there was horrible drama or anything\n\nYour post comes off controlling and dickish (sorry I\u2019m being short but I\u2019m pressed for time)\n\nAt most it\u2019s a \u201chey it kind of bothered me how this all went down can we talk about future instances?\u201d\n\nBut as written YTA", "YTA- just be honest with your wife tell her you resent your brother because your parents had him later in life and you want to watch him struggle and go through tough times because your parents loved the both of you equally and provided for you what they could at the time. It\u2019s a disgusting way to be but I understand some people are like this my own brother is like this towards me.", "YTA for the reaction to your wife.  Your brother is not just YOUR family.  If you've been with your wife long enough to have two teenagers, then I'm sure your wife thinks of him like a little brother too.  And as the home you share is also hers, and there is a SPARE bedroom, your immediate reaction was poor.  I think you need to apologize to your wife, and sit down with your brother, get the whole story, and make sure he knows that his stay with you is not expected to be a permanent one.", "ESH\n\nIt sounds like your wife was just trying to do the right thing. You and your brother aren't close because of the age difference, but it sounds like there's no outright animosity. But I also think she should have cleared it with you before saying he can stay there as long as he needs. One night? fine. Open-ended invitation?  Nope. \n\nYour brother doesn't have a close enough relationship with you or your wife to ask her to drive 2 hours to get him and for a place to stay indefinitely. Yes he is an adult, but he's only 20. Very few of us had our shit together at that age. \n\nI think you could have handled it a little better with your wife, she meant no harm. And lay down the ground rules with your brother. Set a firm time frame that he has to leave by and any other house rules he needs to follow.", "ESH.\n\nYour brother needed help, couldn't reach you, got a hold of his sister in law. She couldn't reach you either. So she took action in the way she felt was right. That is exactly what she should do. YTA because you apparently don't think she should be able to make decisions when you're not around.\n\nShe's not in the clear though. She doesn't get to invite people to stay \"as long as they want\", particularly now that you are involved in the conversation. Two \"yeses\" for your brother to stay, one \"no\" to have him leave, there's no other healthy way to share a space with a partner.\n\nBut congratulations, you do win the game for \"biggest asshole\" here - your brother is her family, too. He has every right to call her. No one has to wait and hope you call back. \n\nIn the morning you should talk to your brother and set a timeline for when he's leaving. In the meantime you should apologize to your wife for treating her as less than a partner.", "YTA your wife is his sister in law yes? She's acting like a sister. Fool of a man.", "YTA also in one paragraph youre saying he is an adult and need to work it out, but 2 paragraphs later you say you dont need another kid there. Also, if youre this petty towards your brother, i can only imagine your teens are learning not to come to you when they have troubles. Your wife is too good for you.", "*I told her that if someone is staying at my house, especially MY family, I should be the one who decides that*\n\nso a couple of things about this part. \n\n\\- so your wife is not family? Because she did marry into your family right?   \n\\- so if your family has a problem and needs help your reaction is to go fuck themselves? \n\nTbh OP, YTA and a heartless one at that. Your kid brother needs help and first thing you do is complain and want to get rid of him.", "YTA go to therapy, you admitted of hating your brother because he simply had better possibilities than you, your jealousy is not healthy, you\u2019re 40, you\u2019ve had 20 years to get help.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Don't get me wrong, he's an AH, but in my opinion, more for acting like a petulant diaper baby. But he's not wrong that his wishes and boundaries are being completely disregarded. AITA is also a big fan of people in a couple handling their own family and not superceding their SO on *their* family. Which is what's happening here. Why is the wife taking the brother's side over OP's?\n\nEDIT: Also, I'm going to be that guy and trot out the cliche here: reverse the genders.

These are boundaries that should not be broken in a relationship regardless of who the house guest is.\n\n*EDIT: this sub is so bad at nuance. In almost any other post, the vast majority would agree that house guests are two yes one no, or that the partner in a couple should be the one to deal with their own family.
