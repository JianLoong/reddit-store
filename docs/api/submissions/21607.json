How long did this occur for?\n\nEDIT: NTA, based on OP\u2019s comments it sounds like she might be having a small seizure or something.

Your friend's reaction leads me to believe he knows something is up and is trying to hide it/cover over it.\n\nPlease, find someone else related to this girl to talk to, because it very much sounds like she needs help and her father is unwilling to get it for her for whatever reason, and may even be involved in whatever the problem is.", "NTA\n\nAnd as someone with epilepsy, I would say that symptoms like that should 100% be reported to a doctor, who will almost definitely have concerns.", "Your friend sounds like he's in deep denial. In my experience, only people who are in denial go right to calling someone a liar and exhibit zero concern for a possible issue with their child. Especially of that magnitude. I hope that little girl gets some help. It sounds like she may be dealing with something that is going to affect her fairly seriously if it's not aided.\n\nETA: NTA. Forgot to add judgment!", "NTA, but you would be if you ignored this. Screaming swearing and crying after a few minutes of silence is NOT normal. That is a sign of either trauma or some issue. The fact that he blows it off makes me worried it's not the first time and he knows the reason or something.\n\nDid you ask WHAT she remembered? Pretty fucking massive thing to not try to find out.\n\nYou're not an asshole for saying he'd be a bad parent for ignoring it. That's just the truth and he clearly needs to hear it.", "NTA. You said he wouldnt be a good parent IF he ignores this. \n\nI assume you two must be fairly good friends for both of you to feel comfortable with the child being in your care?\n\nAnd If you two aren\u2019t good friends\u2026than he\u2019s the AH for leaving his daughter with someone he doesn\u2019t know that well\u2014especially when he could have easily taken her to the store (you both could have gone)", "NTA that's odd behavior and he should be taking it more seriously. He is a bad parent because either he is responsible for the trauma or he's medically neglecting her by not taking her to the doctor. There's no way this was the first time this happened", "No, he\u2019s a bad father and there\u2019s something alarming going on with the kid at home. That\u2019s not normal at all and I hope the kid gets help at least through school, counselors, or other family members. You picked up on something that might be abuse", "NTA and everyone saying you are just because you called someone a bad parent is hilarious. Like, bad parents do exist lol why are we acting like they don't?", "NTA, but these posts tend to bring out the armchair psychologists and I don't know if that's helpful either", "sounds like petit mal to me, but could of course be countless other things, none of them good. A devent parent would be highly concerned, and making an appointment ASAP.   \n\n\nYour friends attitude is kinda concerning too.", "Definitely unnecessary to call him a bad parent but I would be just as confused as you\u2026\n\nTry talking to him again and explain what happened without insulting him. It seems like her didn\u2019t understand the serveity of what you saw.", "ESH - You went to far in calling him a bad parent, especially because that means he'll be less likely to listen to what you have to say. But he also shouldn't disregard things like this. \n\nI remember a friend of mine in school would do something like that occasionally\u2014zone out and freeze in the middle of class. She later told me it was seizures, which she experienced regularly. A quick google says there's something called an \"absence seizure\" or \"petit mal\" that's common, and not serious, in children, but in my friend's case it was associated with other health problems. \n\nWhatever this behavior indicates, your friend should take this seriously and monitor his daughter for another instance, then maybe talk to her pediatrician.", "This is very odd. Soft YTA for the bad parent comment, but you were right to tell your friend what happened. Edit for clarity.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't call someone a \"bad parent\" especially if you aren't a parent. Parenting is extremely hard and finding out something is wrong with your kid is very difficult news to swallow. \n\nFor the sake of the girl I would apologize and try appealing to your friend that as a parent he should at least take the child to a pediatrician and a neurologist to ensure it's not something like a brain tumor than just a behavioral issue. Then let the doctors go from there. \n\nYour friend needs to put his ego aside and digest that news in a more serious way. Ignoring things like that could lead the issue to a point where it is irreparable.", "ESH.\n\nYou did the right thing except calling him a bad parent - it was just unnecessary even if you believe it.\n\nThe kid is displaying signs of what would generally either be post traumatic stress or a neurological issue that could need closer monitoring. You're absolutely right, the kid should definitely be checked out by a medical professional.", "YTA\n\nMainly for suggesting someone else is a bad parent.", "[deleted]", "She is being abused.  I am a child of abuse.  I'm shocked she fave a reaction and it must be super super horrible because that initself takes balls.  Call child protective services and tell them what happened and see what they say.", "[deleted]", "ESH. This is very concerning behavior from your friend\u2019s kid and you absolutely did the right thing by telling him. I  do also agree that he needs to take her to a doctor and that ignoring this incident is a sign of bad parenting.  \n  \nHowever, soft you\u2019re TA for how you told your friend. Instead of asking if this was out of character for her, if everything was okay, etc., you immediately jumped to telling him that something is wrong with his daughter and he\u2019s a bad parent. Telling a parent either of those two things is enough to make them go on the defensive and take what you say with a grain of salt, especially if they have never witnessed this behavior first hand. It\u2019s possible that he\u2019s lying about this never happening as some people will refuse to believe their kid isn\u2019t fine. Regardless, being critical from the get go will only make him more unwilling to see reason.  \n  \nYour friend is also TA for accusing you of lying and disregarding what you told him.  \n  \nMy unsolicited advice is that I think you should try to talk to him again once you\u2019ve both had some time to cool down and/or talk to his daughter\u2019s mom (if you can) because whether his daughter is having seizures, being abused, or any number of other things, she needs help. Come from a place of genuine concern and avoid passing any judgement as much as you can. Using \u201cI\u201d statements (ex: \u201cI\u2019m worried that your daughter had a seizure\u201d vs. \u201cyou need to get your daughter checked out to rule out seizures\u201d) gives you a better shot at reducing the defensiveness and accusations. As my mother always says, being \u201ccurious not furious\u201d will get you a lot further in contentious situations.", "YTA for calling him a bad parent. He definitely should be watchful for any other signs or episodes but he can't \"take her somewhere\" based of something you only observed.

Medical events don\u2019t always conveniently happen when the parents are able to directly witness them.\n\nDad may actually be an obtuse arse, it\u2019s possible.

Kids are most often diagnosed by telling doctors stuff that parents or other people (teachers, family friends etc) observed.\n\nMost paediatricians would immediately run tests for epilepsy or even ptsd based on this description alone. Not being as knowledgeable as a doctor doesnt make anyone a bad parent, but not taking kids to the doctor JUST TO BE SURE when someone you know expresses concern and has a detailed story...definitely is being a bad parent.", "I don't know what doctors you've been blessed to have, but if he went in to most doctors and said someone babysitting my kid said \"xyz\" they'd ask him if he'd ever seen anything and what other symptoms had he noticed.

Noted! Thankfully the doctors I've been to don't need to worry about \"expensive tests\". They'd worry about the kid.\n\nEDIT: explain to me how this again makes the dad not a bad parent? Just because your doctors are incompetent does not mean you shouldn't try for the sake of your child. At least start paying attention? Do what the doctor said and start monitoring? Lord this kid might have a full on seizure one day and hurt himself and it could have been prevented, but suuuure, that's all regular and decent parentage!", "Your edit is exactly what I said. He needs to start watching his child for other signs and symptoms. I said he's not a bad parent because he knows, depending on the healthcare system, the doctor is not going to do anything.

Not taking him to the doctor, no watching for signs. Just claims op is lying about what he saw.  Clearly said that, not gonna monutor his kids. Someone tells him they saw his kid acted strange, and he got defensive and angry. So obviously a bad parent. \n\nYou also said he doesnt have enough information to go off, which he would if going to a doctor.... in a European system it seems. Nonetheless, dad obviously doesnt even know what to monitor for? Any doctor would at least know what to look for? I can not comprehend this mentality of not going to a professional to at least ask for what to look out for, even if testing is apparently out of reach. \n\nIs this the influence of a bad healthcare system?\n\nEdit: I also did not say what you said, I think the dad categorically needs to go to a doctor or some sort of professional. Not observing without professional advice, I was referring to going to a doctor either way and now knowing what to possibly look out for.", "NTA.\n\nPlease call CPS, or whatever agency in your country protects children.", "Not in the medical field, but I've had students do this in class. It sounds like absence seizures.", "She sounds like me. Possible absence seizures. I would apologize and strongly encourage him, again, to have him get her checked out by a medical professional.", "You're right on the money, but also, they can often start so small in children that NO ONE notices for years.  Kids with it have been diagnosed with ADHD over it.  This might have been the first time it presented with swearing.  The spacing out is hard to notice sometimes.", "In America, at least, your doctor seems to want you to come in already know what your diagnosis is. It's never \"lets run all the tests and we'll figure it out\". It's here is a subscription for what I can physically see. Go home and call if something changes or if new symptoms appear .\n\nIf he goes to the doctor now they are literally going to draw blood and check her stats but other than that they will say \"watch her for anything abnormal\". They won't give specifics or start guessing what it might be.\n\nAs I said he should be monitoring his daughter for the things his friend mentioned but depending on where he lives nothing will be accomplished by going to the doctor other then his insurance getting hit, and that's assuming he has insurance. I know he had an attitude with his friend but now that she's told him he won't be able to help noticing the signs.", "Lord what a terrible system, how harrowing. Thank you for the education though! \n\nYou have more faith in this dad than I do it seems. I just find his reaction very odd. Giving attitude about the wellbeing of your child...I suppose we have entirely different parameters of what it means to be a good parent. I feel like there's a difference between \"not being able to help spotting signs\" and \"actively looking out for signs in good faith\" (which would also include doing research, notifying other people to keep watch etc) and Imo that's where the limit of being a good parent gets crossed.", "Doctor here, it does seem like absence seizure. May be her mom didn't notice that because it kept on happening so ofen. I would suggest you reach out once more to her and ask her to get the kid checked out, please do this for the sake of the kid.", "I agree.

Even after my teen babysitter saw one and tried to describe it, she got brushed off as misunderstanding or reacting to me getting random little kid upset or distracted. \n\nBut it took one in front of my parents where I suddenly screamed and said nonsense words after for them to understand/ believe it! It used to be the same thing as this little kid - I would be talking  or doing something and then \"freeze\" or \"pause\" basically , sometimes even mid sentence and then continue on like it hadn't happened or like i would respond to a hello hello hello sort of attempt to get my attention and not realize what had just happened because all I remembered was starting saying or doing whatever I froze during . \n\nI hope this little girl gets help asap", "Omg literally me though! It took so long before a parent saw and realized. My friends mentioned it first then my cousins and the adults brushed them off or thought they were being dramatic or I was (which ok fair knowing little me lol) . Even my babysitter seeing it and not quite knowing what it was or how to describe it , was super easily justified as describing me getting little kid upset or distracted", "NTA, but this sounds exactly like my friend\u2019s son\u2019s seizures and you should bring that up. Calling him a bad parent is not going to make him receptive to your suggestion, but she really needs to be checked out by a doctor.", "Agreed! I have two different types of seizures. The ones that present similarly to this little girl's were the 1st type I presented with and the ones I have most often. I don't swear but I say some weird things and never remember it later. I was an adult when they developed and it was really tough at 1st. This Dad needs to seek a medical opinion to help his daughter if she is indeed having seizures.", "That was the first thing I thought (I have ZERO experience but enjoy Wikipedia deep dives every now and then) and the freakout would make sense to me at least.\n\nPersonally I would freak out if I blinked and suddenly an unknown about of time has passed and I feel weird.", "This is what I was going to say.
