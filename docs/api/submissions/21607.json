How long did this occur for?\n\nEDIT: NTA, based on OP\u2019s comments it sounds like she might be having a small seizure or something. The parent is very irresponsible for just brushing it off and blaming OP.\n\nCaling him a bad parent was not the smartest move though, even if it\u2019s true. He definitley won\u2019t trust anything you say now\u2026", "NTA\n\nTake this comment with a grain of salt, because obviously I don't have the whole story, but this sounds a LOT like signs of abuse. Like, it sounds like the girl was having a ptsd reaction or something. Is there another parent or relative you can talk to about this? Your friend's reaction leads me to believe he knows something is up and is trying to hide it/cover over it.\n\nPlease, find someone else related to this girl to talk to, because it very much sounds like she needs help and her father is unwilling to get it for her for whatever reason, and may even be involved in whatever the problem is.", "NTA\n\nAnd as someone with epilepsy, I would say that symptoms like that should 100% be reported to a doctor, who will almost definitely have concerns.", "Your friend sounds like he's in deep denial. In my experience, only people who are in denial go right to calling someone a liar and exhibit zero concern for a possible issue with their child. Especially of that magnitude. I hope that little girl gets some help. It sounds like she may be dealing with something that is going to affect her fairly seriously if it's not aided.\n\nETA: NTA. Forgot to add judgment!", "NTA, but you would be if you ignored this. Screaming swearing and crying after a few minutes of silence is NOT normal. That is a sign of either trauma or some issue. The fact that he blows it off makes me worried it's not the first time and he knows the reason or something.\n\nDid you ask WHAT she remembered? Pretty fucking massive thing to not try to find out.\n\nYou're not an asshole for saying he'd be a bad parent for ignoring it. That's just the truth and he clearly needs to hear it.", "NTA. You said he wouldnt be a good parent IF he ignores this. \n\nI assume you two must be fairly good friends for both of you to feel comfortable with the child being in your care?\n\nAnd If you two aren\u2019t good friends\u2026than he\u2019s the AH for leaving his daughter with someone he doesn\u2019t know that well\u2014especially when he could have easily taken her to the store (you both could have gone)", "NTA that's odd behavior and he should be taking it more seriously. He is a bad parent because either he is responsible for the trauma or he's medically neglecting her by not taking her to the doctor. There's no way this was the first time this happened", "No, he\u2019s a bad father and there\u2019s something alarming going on with the kid at home. That\u2019s not normal at all and I hope the kid gets help at least through school, counselors, or other family members. You picked up on something that might be abuse", "NTA and everyone saying you are just because you called someone a bad parent is hilarious. Like, bad parents do exist lol why are we acting like they don't?", "NTA, but these posts tend to bring out the armchair psychologists and I don't know if that's helpful either", "sounds like petit mal to me, but could of course be countless other things, none of them good. A devent parent would be highly concerned, and making an appointment ASAP.   \n\n\nYour friends attitude is kinda concerning too.", "Definitely unnecessary to call him a bad parent but I would be just as confused as you\u2026\n\nTry talking to him again and explain what happened without insulting him. It seems like her didn\u2019t understand the serveity of what you saw.", "ESH - You went to far in calling him a bad parent, especially because that means he'll be less likely to listen to what you have to say. But he also shouldn't disregard things like this. \n\nI remember a friend of mine in school would do something like that occasionally\u2014zone out and freeze in the middle of class. She later told me it was seizures, which she experienced regularly. A quick google says there's something called an \"absence seizure\" or \"petit mal\" that's common, and not serious, in children, but in my friend's case it was associated with other health problems. \n\nWhatever this behavior indicates, your friend should take this seriously and monitor his daughter for another instance, then maybe talk to her pediatrician.", "This is very odd. Soft YTA for the bad parent comment, but you were right to tell your friend what happened. Edit for clarity.", "ESH\n\nYou shouldn't call someone a \"bad parent\" especially if you aren't a parent. Parenting is extremely hard and finding out something is wrong with your kid is very difficult news to swallow. \n\nFor the sake of the girl I would apologize and try appealing to your friend that as a parent he should at least take the child to a pediatrician and a neurologist to ensure it's not something like a brain tumor than just a behavioral issue. Then let the doctors go from there. \n\nYour friend needs to put his ego aside and digest that news in a more serious way. Ignoring things like that could lead the issue to a point where it is irreparable.", "ESH.\n\nYou did the right thing except calling him a bad parent - it was just unnecessary even if you believe it.\n\nThe kid is displaying signs of what would generally either be post traumatic stress or a neurological issue that could need closer monitoring. You're absolutely right, the kid should definitely be checked out by a medical professional.", "YTA\n\nMainly for suggesting someone else is a bad parent.", "[deleted]", "She is being abused.  I am a child of abuse.  I'm shocked she fave a reaction and it must be super super horrible because that initself takes balls.  Call child protective services and tell them what happened and see what they say.", "[deleted]", "ESH. This is very concerning behavior from your friend\u2019s kid and you absolutely did the right thing by telling him. I  do also agree that he needs to take her to a doctor and that ignoring this incident is a sign of bad parenting.  \n  \nHowever, soft you\u2019re TA for how you told your friend. Instead of asking if this was out of character for her, if everything was okay, etc., you immediately jumped to telling him that something is wrong with his daughter and he\u2019s a bad parent. Telling a parent either of those two things is enough to make them go on the defensive and take what you say with a grain of salt, especially if they have never witnessed this behavior first hand. It\u2019s possible that he\u2019s lying about this never happening as some people will refuse to believe their kid isn\u2019t fine. Regardless, being critical from the get go will only make him more unwilling to see reason.  \n  \nYour friend is also TA for accusing you of lying and disregarding what you told him.  \n  \nMy unsolicited advice is that I think you should try to talk to him again once you\u2019ve both had some time to cool down and/or talk to his daughter\u2019s mom (if you can) because whether his daughter is having seizures, being abused, or any number of other things, she needs help. Come from a place of genuine concern and avoid passing any judgement as much as you can. Using \u201cI\u201d statements (ex: \u201cI\u2019m worried that your daughter had a seizure\u201d vs. \u201cyou need to get your daughter checked out to rule out seizures\u201d) gives you a better shot at reducing the defensiveness and accusations. As my mother always says, being \u201ccurious not furious\u201d will get you a lot further in contentious situations.", "YTA for calling him a bad parent. He definitely should be watchful for any other signs or episodes but he can't \"take her somewhere\" based of something you only observed. He doesn't have enough information to act on yet.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.
