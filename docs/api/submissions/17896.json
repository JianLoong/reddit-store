My brother (18M) was gifted a car on his birthday, which was in December last year. Since i bought my own car, he has been using mine without letting me know first. \n\nI've tried to talk to him about it, but he said he should be entlitled to using it whenever, because I didn't buy it \\*all\\* on my own. I paid for like 90% of it by using money i had saved up by working, and the rest was birthday/christmas money. So because I used some of the birthday money he gave me, he was entitled to use it. \n\nI asked him why he couldn't use his own, cause it's a nice car & there's nothing wrong with it. He said it was because mine was nicer, and his only had two seats so he had to use mine when he wanted to pick up friends. I told him to just ask before he uses it, and to please fill the gas tank, and that I still had first right to it, because it is my car.\n\nNow, I might be an asshole because yesterday I wanted to go to the mall and buy some yarn to finisg a crochet protect. My brother came up to me and told me he was taking the car to pick up his girlfriend. I told him no, because I needed to use the car. He told me to walk, or just use the bus and took my keys and just left with my car!\n\nI called him and said, that the next time he takes my car, I will report it stolen. He started crying saying i was trying to isolate him, and keep him away from his friends and girlfriend. I feel so bad, but I am tired of not knowing if I can use my own car or not. And I'm tired of having to pay for gas I don't even use. But he really seemed upset, so I don't know if I went too far.

Straight up he needs to stop that now before other adults notice that shit because it won't fly in the real world. Him crying won't stop the police arresting him the next time he steals your car. It won't stop his boss for firing him because he was late too many times. It won't get him any respect in the adult world at all. I get that everyone has their own struggles etc and I'm not diminishing his; for all I know he's got a reason to be that kind of reactive, although frankly I can't think of one that means that it isn't still his responsibility to behave like an adult. Having mental or physical health issues is not an excuse to behave however you like though. \n\nYou're NTA, your brother is.
