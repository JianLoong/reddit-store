I'm very happy to have this car. I live far away from school, and the cloesest bus stop is 3km away because I live on the country side. My brother (18M) was gifted a car on his birthday, which was in December last year. Since i bought my own car, he has been using mine without letting me know first.\n\nI've tried to talk to him about it, but he said he should be entlitled to using it whenever, because I didn't buy it \\*all\\* on my own. I paid for like 90% of it by using money i had saved up by working, and the rest was birthday/christmas money. So because I used some of the birthday money he gave me, he was entitled to use it.\n\nI asked him why he couldn't use his own, cause it's a nice car & there's nothing wrong with it. He said it was because mine was nicer, and his only had two seats so he had to use mine when he wanted to pick up friends. I told him to just ask before he uses it, and to please fill the gas tank, and that I still had first right to it, because it is my car.\n\nNow, I might be an asshole because yesterday I wanted to go to the mall and buy some yarn to finisg a crochet protect. My brother came up to me and told me he was taking the car to pick up his girlfriend. I told him no, because I needed to use the car. He told me to walk, or just use the bus and took my keys and just left with my car!\n\nI called him and said, that the next time he takes my car, I will report it stolen. He started crying saying i was trying to isolate him, and keep him away from his friends and girlfriend. I feel so bad, but I am tired of not knowing if I can use my own car or not. And I'm tired of having to pay for gas I don't even use. But he really seemed upset, so I don't know if I went too far. AITA?  \n\n\n**EDIT:**   \nI just wanna clear up some things  \n\n\n**Why does he has acess to your keys?** We use a Key holder to avoid anyone losing their keys. I will start to leave my keys in my room/some where safe where he can't get to them.  \n\n\n**Where are the parents in all this?** I did talk to them. But they weren't really that much help. My mom thinks I'm an AH/Selfish/Entitled to keep the car for myself. My dad thinks he shouldn't even be driving the car. But whatever my mom says, goes in our home.   \n\n\n**Yes, my brother is a golden child**. Has always been. He was bullied a lot more in school, so my mom got more protective of him/his needs came first cause he had it worst.

Straight up he needs to stop that now before other adults notice that shit because it won't fly in the real world. Him crying won't stop the police arresting him the next time he steals your car. It won't stop his boss for firing him because he was late too many times. It won't get him any respect in the adult world at all. I get that everyone has their own struggles etc and I'm not diminishing his; for all I know he's got a reason to be that kind of reactive, although frankly I can't think of one that means that it isn't still his responsibility to behave like an adult.

Also he could pick up his girlfriend with just two seats. \n\nOne sibling doesn\u2019t usually bow down to the other so easily and if her brother has taken her car why wouldn\u2019t she start taking his? Simple solution to show him how it feels if his is also a nice car. \n\nIn a lot of these posts the person just taking property claims they are \u201centitled to it\u201d I have never heard anyone actually say straight out loud in real life that they are entitled to something. If anyone I know had a sibling claim to be entitled to their possessions they would not be met with a passive response, it\u2019s more likely they would have the keys wrenched back off them! \n\nLastly if someone keeps taking your car (especially when you are about to use it) why are you leaving the keys in an accessible place? If I was in that situation my keys would never be out of my sight and if I could then I\u2019d park the car somewhere hidden too. \n\nIt might be genuine, I know first hand what it\u2019s like having a sibling be the golden child. My sister was given a car and I had to buy my own (she was also given pretty much everything else in life including a house!) But there is nothing about parents supporting her brother taking the car, she seems to just be letting him. It could be possible that she\u2019s so used to her brother just getting everything given to him and getting his own way all the time that she has lost the ability to stick up for herself and just sees her brother as more important then her as she\u2019s been led to believe that. My sister being handed everything on a plate reinforced my belief that everything I worked for was mine though. I am proud that everything I have achieved in my life was my own doing and from hard work, not from just sticking my hand out. \n\nI take a lot of these posts with a pinch of salt but a 19 year old who has worked hard and saved up for a car seems unlikely to just hand it over to her brother when he starts to cry - especially if he\u2019s been gifted his own. I would be surprised if anyone has the audacity to believe that giving someone money for their birthday means that they part own something too.\n\nIt\u2019s the same as the posts that claim random parents have approached them and demanded the OP hand over their possessions to their kids and get angry if they refuse. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s possible but the amount of people who question they are an AH for refusing seems less likely!", "Probably and crying tears of woe when it\u2019s too big and demanding she exchanges it for one in his size!\n\nShe should start using any gifts she\u2019s ever  bought him or given money towards as she used her own money to pay for them.", "that really depends on where you live... my insurance follows me, not the car I'm in.

At least for liability.\n\nYou could have issues if the insurer determined you lied about the primary driver (address, age, etc) e.g. if OP claimed it's her dad's car to get a better rate, but other drivers using the car are covered.

You are not the ah in this but you need to be. That auto is NOT a toy. He is probably hot rodding around and not being as careful as you would be. Please don\u2019t be afraid to stand up for yourself. If he takes it again, call the car in as stolen by your brother who does not have permission to drive your car. If you happen to KNOW any cops maybe they could speak to him about how much it would cost him to be locked up for that. Yeh Mom and Dad might bail him out but I promise it would cost him. You have to be firm about this. Don\u2019t make the threat then not follow thru. Maybe stop going home during time off. Or ask your parents to speak to him. And let THEM know you are not playing around. One more question. If he were to wreck your car could YOU afford repairs or replacement?

Golden Children can do no wrong. If they did it, then a wrong thing suddenly becomes completely reasonable and correct.)\n\nBut tbf, we have no idea. Could be the parents weren\u2019t involved at all and an aunt/uncle/friend gave him the car for some separate relationship maybe even with the thought that it\u2019s a crappy but serviceable car that they hoped would stop the bro from doing exactly what he\u2019s doing anyway: constantly \u201cborrowing\u201d his sister\u2019s hard earned car and harassing her about it.
