I paid for like 90% of it by using money i had saved up by working, and the rest was birthday/christmas money. So because I used some of the birthday money he gave me, he was entitled to use it. \n\nI asked him why he couldn't use his own, cause it's a nice car & there's nothing wrong with it. He said it was because mine was nicer, and his only had two seats so he had to use mine when he wanted to pick up friends. I told him to just ask before he uses it, and to please fill the gas tank, and that I still had first right to it, because it is my car.\n\nNow, I might be an asshole because yesterday I wanted to go to the mall and buy some yarn to finisg a crochet protect. My brother came up to me and told me he was taking the car to pick up his girlfriend. I told him no, because I needed to use the car. He told me to walk, or just use the bus and took my keys and just left with my car!\n\nI called him and said, that the next time he takes my car, I will report it stolen. He started crying saying i was trying to isolate him, and keep him away from his friends and girlfriend. I feel so bad, but I am tired of not knowing if I can use my own car or not.
