Never knew dyscalculia was a thing", "I don't think anyone has enough fingers to count all the ways OP is being an AH.", "I work in a library, and we all sing the alphabet under our breath from time to time.", "I still glance rapidly back and forth between my palms for directions sometimes. When I was a child I had a birthmark on my right hand that I used to tell me which hand was right. The mark has long since vanished, but I still have that old habit of checking it for directions.", "I don\u2019t hold up my fingers to tell but I do mimic writing something so I know it\u2019s my right hand \ud83e\udd23", "I went to library school because they said there'd be no math ;-)\n\nBut I still sing the alphabet song to myself* when I shelve books.\n\n*And only to myself ~ I'm a great believer in multiple types of intelligences, but I must have really ADHDed it when the universe was handing the intelligences out, as I completely missed the Ms: mathematical, mechanical, musical.", "I also teach math and tell students to make sense what they have to get to an answer.", "I\u2019d have confused him then. I had a birthmark on my right hand and when I was very young I used it to figure out which hand was right. It\u2019s gone now, but I still have the habit of checking my hands for the direction.\n\nBut I\u2019m not dyslexic. I\u2019m HYPERlexic. I\u2019ve been reading since before I was old enough to remember learning how. Hyperlexia and dyslexia are related though, at least according to some studies. So there is that.", "My sister can\u2019t tell left from right, she\u2019s 56. Never been diagnosed with anything though - perhaps there\u2019s something undiagnosed going on there", "I do too! Like in pool, I can see the lines for some reason.", "I'm both hyperlexic & dyslexic. Brains are weird.", "I\u2019m not sure what hyperlexia is I\u2019ll have to google it. But I was a great reader growing up and it took me scarring my right thumb to be able to tell my left from right. My best friend growing up was dyslexic and couldn\u2019t tell her left from right for even longer than me if I remember correctly. Interesting!", "I'd never heard of hyperlexia. Thanks.", "So in medical school, we get the absolute bejesus fucked out of us about left and right, because *you treat everything as the patient\u2019s left side, not yours* and the patient is usually opposite you while you are talking to them. Left and right have no meaning in real life anymore\n\nEdit: I have been known to navigate while my husband is driving and confidently say \u201cturn left\u201d and then \u201c NO not THAT left, the patient\u2019s left!\u201d", "YTA doubly so for needing to even ask.", "Former accountant working in supply chain, studying postgrad in data here - I use my fingers to do a lot of simple maths in the office, too. Wait til OP find out that thousands of literal human computers out of China do mental calculations by mimicking abacus movements.", "Yo have you watched those little kids in spelling bees? They pull out words that I can't believe and they write it out on their hands first. I guarantee they're smarter than all of us.", "It's called mnemonic device. I can't snap with my left hand so I developed a pattern where I would snap my right hand to be able to determine right from left. I would give directions such as: \" it's just down Power Road on the *snap* left side\n\nEdit for vote: YTA", "Me too!", "They've actually done linguistic studies on gestures and using your hands to detail parts of a story, locations in space time, etc. And those studies found that people's abilities to recount events and maintain a good flow significantly decreased if they were made to sit on their hands.\n\nSo basically... Moving your hands around helps cognitive function. And even if is didn't, OP's definitely TA. Who cares if someone counts on their fingers?\n\nSource: unfortunately can't remember who did the study, but I read about it at uni when I did linguistics.", "It\u2019s also very common in people with dyscalculia", "I have hyperlexia, could read from around two which made reading very boring in school.\n\nI never learned the alphabet, it seemed irrelevant, until at some point the class started learning French. If I'm trying to place a letter, I still sing the alphabet, under my breath, in French.", "Damn right!", "I'm also hyperlexic (and late diagnosed autistic with ADHD) and I used to check the freckles on on of my hands for left and right as a little kid.\n\nMy brother, though, is severely dyslexia and ambidextrous. He has had terrible problems with left and right plus directions and getting placenames mixed up throughout his life.", "Oh wow, that explains a lot about myself.\n\nI got my first watch for my 6th birthday and since then I have always worn watches, and used them to be confident about where left and right are.\nI mean, I KNOW what wrist my watch goes on, and I know that side is left. No problem there. And in general, I can tell left and right apart.\n\nBut when I have to quickly decide which side is which in everyday situations, I sometimes get confused and check what side my watch is on, just to be sure.\n\nAnd, I don't remember this at all, but according to my mom, I taught myself to read when I was three, because I got tired of depending on her to read to me.\n\nI never knew hyperlexia was a thing, neat.", "It\u2019s reading at an extremely young age. I started reading at 2.5, which is why I don\u2019t remember learning. It made elementary awful, TBH, because I was reading so far in advance of my peers.\n\nWeird memory I have is of getting bored learning the alphabet - which I didn\u2019t know - and leaving circle time in Kindergarten to go read. Because I could read, but hadn\u2019t yet learned the names of all the letters. Most people don\u2019t do it that way, lol!", "I\u2019m not sure exactly when I learned to read but it was also before school. I used to read the readers the class were working on lightning fast then ask my teacher if I could read her teaching manual to her instead, when I was around 4 or 5. Maybe I was hyperlexic! I\u2019m also adhd which also has a connection with pretty much everything including dyslexia", "It is the same in theatre, you have stage left and stage right and they are from the perspective of you looking out into the audience.", "Seems like I would get on brilliant in a medical setting then cause I am so baffled by my left and right and constantly mix them up.
