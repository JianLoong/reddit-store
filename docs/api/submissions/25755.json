That he's not investing in your family now tells me he's not planning on doing so ever. Yeah, you can't pay as much because you're in school - that's common in young families. Usually partners pick up the slack to support the family, with the understanding that it's investing in the whole group's future. Partners often take on a bit more burden to support the other, sometimes they even trade off, depending on circumstances. But it is all for the benefit of the family.

Like if he earns 100k and you 50 I think there are many reasons to argue he should not have to pay more than you. But at least the same amount at minimum. 50/50 in total. Including home maintenance. That is fair by definition. Raw cost eaten as a cash flow split between the two of you. \n\nHowever you eat put a certain amount of time into making this money. One could argue that means one should pay more relative to how much more he makes. Time is money. He makes 100, her 50, 40 hours each. He pays 66 percent you 33 percent. I don't really agree with that, but him contributing a little more such as dates adds up too. \n\nSo I think 50 50 is fair, which this is not.
