{"id": 25755, "submission_id": "1644smq", "title": "AITA for telling my boyfriend I won\u2019t pay our bills?", "selftext": "Throwaway for privacy. My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) have been together for 7 years and we live together and have a young child. He works full time and I work part time because I\u2019m in college full time. He makes a lot more money than I do because 1. He gets paid more and 2. He works a lot more hours than me. He only pays our rent and I pay the rest of our bills. I spend every single penny I make on bills and necessities, and don\u2019t have any money left for myself or to save. I own and pay for both of our cars, utilities, credit cards, etc. \n\nHe insists that it\u2019s fair that he pays rent and I pay the rest of the bills, even though he makes a lot more money than I do. I should also mention that what I pay in bills every month is a lot more than our rent and he complains or tells me to work more hours when I ask him to contribute or help me financially. He still has at least a thousand dollars leftover to save and spend after paying his share while I have nothing. I told him I won\u2019t pay these bills alone anymore because frankly I can\u2019t afford to and he got really mad at me. He told me all I care about is money. I\u2019ve explained the situation to multiple people and some think I\u2019m an AH, and others think he should help me more. AITA? \n\nTLDR ; I told my boyfriend I won\u2019t pay our bills alone anymore because I can\u2019t afford to and he makes more money than me and won\u2019t contribute. He got mad at me and said that all I care about is money.\n\nETA \u2014 a lot of you are asking how much the bills cost and what exactly I\u2019m paying. The bills are about $1800 a month and our rent is $1300. My credit card bills from both of our purchases are about $8k in total and I have to pay for electric, gas, car payment, insurance for both our cars, food, stuff for our kid, etc. Another thing I will mention is I\u2019m only going to college to get a new career so we can buy a house. He makes roughly 40k a year and I will be making 60k to start plus raises every year. I\u2019m continuing my education once I get into my field and plan to earn my doctorate eventually. Once that is achieved, I will be making around 130k alone. He has told me before that once I finish school and make a good salary, he wants to be a stay at home dad and I can support us. I don\u2019t want to be in poverty for the rest of my life so I\u2019m trying to create a nice life for my family.\n\nETA #2 \u2014 I have asked my parents and boyfriends mother on their opinion/advice. My parents said since we are a family unit he needs to support us and contribute more. He should be paying for most, if not all, since he is making more and I\u2019m working less while in college. After I graduate and work, we can split the bills evenly. They said ideally, he would be the one supporting us completely and I can stay home with our young child, but he refuses to get a higher paying job, so I\u2019m in college now to get a better paying job to help support us. I asked boyfriend\u2019s mother, and she said we should either not live together or I should work more to pay the bills if I can\u2019t afford to. She basically agreed with his stance.\n\nETA #3 \u2014 I\u2019ll make this short and sweet because I know my post is really long. Originally he wasn\u2019t on board with me going to college because he knew I was gonna be working less and we were financially okay when I worked full time (around 80k together). I grew up with parents who encouraged me to be ambitious and I\u2019m a go-getter. I WANT that really nice 800k house with a white picket fence and financial stability and I WILL have it one day. He\u2019s the type of person who doesn\u2019t care about growth and is content with 40k a year. He says I care about money too much because I want a really nice life and it hurts my feelings.", "created_utc": 1693273122, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1644smq/aita_for_telling_my_boyfriend_i_wont_pay_our_bills/", "score": 1868, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Clearly that\u2019s wrong because \u201che makes way more than her\u201d so she needs to make less now either by working less hours or by being paid less. But she can\u2019t be paid less in this 20 hour work week case because then she can\u2019t pay the bills anymore. \n\nOkay maybe it\u2019s better if rent is 2000 a month. That means he makes 3000 a month take home at 18.75 an hour and then she needs to clear 2000 this month part time for bills which means she would make 25 an hour for a 20 hour work week. Crap that\u2019s wrong too bc now she is making more than him. \n\nOkay last try and I\u2019m doing this as a stream of consciousness btw.

And then she would need to clear 900 so call it 1000 and now she makes 12.5 an hour working 20 hours a week. \n\nEven if she worked like 15 hours a week only (aka he has way more hours than me) she would make 16.6 an hour. \n\nSomething isn\u2019t mathing in this post", "She\u2019s working part time and can cover all those bills.

And I\u2019m pleased to say that we haven\u2019t had a single fight about money since we actually took the plunge and joined finances. If you\u2019re not interested in the technicalities just skip past!\n\nI\u2019m disabled, and can\u2019t work but when me and my wife moved in together/got married I lost all my out of work benefits (kept a small amount of non work related benefits) and my wife became financially responsible for me (which is how it works in the majority of countries sadly). That was obviously a HUGE decision to make, for both of us, so we spent a lot of time working out how to manage our finances before taking the plunge. \n\nWhat we came up with was a somewhat complicated system but essentially we have savings and various money split across bank accounts in individual names the other doesn\u2019t have access to (mainly mine was left where it was and she adds to hers) but we consider it to be joint money (legally it is). Some of it is earmarked for specific things like upgrading my/our car, some of it is unallocated safety net but we make decisions about spending it together. \n\nWe then each have a \u2018fun money\u2019 account with the same in each every month, and a \u2018runaway fund\u2019 (realistically a dishwasher fund, a holiday fund, I got too fat for my wardrobe and need to go on a shopping spree fund\u2026. Neither of us are concerned about needing to runaway but the idea is sort of based on that idea that you should always have your own safety fund). Really it\u2019s any purchase that only one person wanted that was too large to come out of monthly fun money. We started those funds off with \u00a31000 each and then a small amount of savings are transferred to each of those accounts every month. We both found the fund grew rather than shrank initially but since the cost of everything has gone through the roof mine is certainly diminishing.\n\nWe then have a joint account for specific purchases like groceries and petrol, stuff needed for the house, that kinda thing. We generally don\u2019t ask permission for spends on there because we kinda know what it\u2019s for and it\u2019s not usually for bigger things as the amount transferred in to  there is to cover day to day living costs not big purchases. \n\nIt probably sounds quite complicated but it\u2019s really not. Both our fun money funds and our joint account are with Monzo so we can very quickly see the accounts, live update itemised spending, and move money between them. Those are the accounts we are primarily interacting with day to day.\n\nIt works really well, moth have an equal amount of money that we have total autonomy over and then both have easy access to funds outside of that, that we consider shared mmoney but it means neither of us would ever be sitting there looking at a bank account that says \u00a30. \n\nMy wife has an all singing all dancing spreadsheet on it which I can\u2019t say I have very much to do with at all but when we need to make adjustments in our financial plan we sit down and look at it together.

This guy sounds like my asshole ex.", "They're not married and she could probably get full custody as the primary caregver now", "I'm not sure if you got off in the weeds with this comment.. but is it really your position that being the sole breadwinner is financial abuse?  \n\nor is it only if it's a her?", "You had a say in cumming in her, which was necessary to make the child. By doing so, you accepted a lifelong responsibility to that potential child.", "I don't sleep around. I have been in a committed relationship for over 11 years. We have 4 kids. We both take care of our children and if we were to ever split, nothing would change, our kids would never be without either parent. We would still both be taking care of them regardless of any bad blood. And I said nothing about not supporting the kid. I said I despise the mandated child support in most cases because it doesn't all go to the kid.", "Yes! There were 2 meanings to what I wrote. I despise a GOOD parent that takes care of their kids being put on child support because it's often more than they can afford and still get by and normally they end up paying more than what the kid needs and and the other parent pockets it and does whatever they want. The other reason I despise that, is that there are only 2 reasons a parent has to file normally... 1 is that the other parent doesn't want to take care of the child that they helped bring into this world(I despise those people in general) 2nd reason it's filed is just out of spite.", "Yes!! This!!! This is exactly what I meant!!! Some people just want to jump to conclusions and go all keyboard warrior like it's an Olympic sport.", "esh", "It's always a throw-away account, almost like this story is fabricated.", "He tells her to \u201cwork more\u201d as if that\u2019s the solution. But she\u2019s in college in order to make more money in the long run. Then, he states that once she does make more, he will expect her to provide all finances while he stays at home? \n\nExcuse me no. He needs to support her NOW if he wants her to support him LATER. Talk to any spouse of a doctor through med school. Usually the med school student is broke and lives off their spouse. Then, they go on to make a lot of money and said spouse can now be a stay at home and care for the children. It\u2019s a fair trade. Why should OP support him later if he won\u2019t support her at all?", "Ruined her life ngl", "Colleges, especially advanced degrees, are rapidly filling with women instead of men. I imagine so very many of them are just like OP. Desperate to live better than their partner has the drive to live.", "Yes!!!! \nListen honey if this man is your boyfriend \u2014- DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING.  Do you understand me? Not a freaking dime.  \nIf you aren\u2019t married, you don\u2019t spend a single penny on anything you don\u2019t want to and here is why.  \nThat\u2019s his responsibility.  If you weren\u2019t living with him, guess what?  He pays all his rent, all his expenses, and your child support payments.  Period.  That\u2019s HIS RESPONSIBILITY.  \n\nIf you pay for anything and you are not his wife, he is cheating you out of your own future and he\u2019s using you.  DO NOT BE STUPID.  He will be able to drop you like nothing the day your kid is 18 and owe you nothing.  Get it?  The two decades you wasted on him, gone.  No security. No nothing.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t like it. Let him dump you and he can pay for everything on top of your child and you have your freedom to do as you please and with anyone you like.  He wants to tie you down for free and then have the freedom to replace you with no penalty.    \nUntil the day you are his wife\u2026. You don\u2019t spend your money, got it?? PROMISE ME.", "I get a nagging feeling when she starts making more and he becomes a \u201cSAHP\u201d he will do the bare minimum while she\u2019s away and leave OP to do the rest when she\u2019s home while paying all bills. \n\nPlease leave. This is BS and not a good partner", "Honestly this. The fact he plans on being a stay at home dad but not even paying all the bills now but expects you to later on is disgusting and selfish.", "This is the one.", "NTA.  This.  Next weekend is the first anniversary of the day that our friend says I saved her life.  She disobeyed her controlling husband and went sailing with me like she had always wanted to.  In the middle her usually beaming smile failed her and she began crying like anything.  It came out that he had been abusing her for the last fifteen years. We talked while we sailed around for another hour or so and she threw him out the next day. Tomorrow is always the first day of the rest of your life.", "Jesus, it's wild how many people's solutions to solvable problems are to destroy the family and milk the other for money instead of communicating and working on finances together. \"It'll just get worse\" spoken like someone who's probably never had a successful relationship because they're running at the first speed bump\n\nHell you don't even know if this story is 100% accurate and even it it was, your solution to a nearly 7 year relationship with a child involved is leave the relationship, no care paid to the affects that will have on the child long term, and frankly. It's wild there's not even an modicum of skepticism about what kind of bills he pays, and even if he isn't paying all the bills she isn't making any claims at all that he is spending this money wildly, is it entirely possible he is saving that money for their house, something that would be entirely reasonable? She isn't saying he uses this go go out on weekends, or to buy video games, or fuel his hobbies, she just said he isn't spending it.\n\nSeriously, how do you take in something as simple as she is spending 500 bucks a month more than him in bills even though he makes more, so she should just leave the relationship?\n\nWhat it sounds like is she wants disposable income to spend on herself and he isn't spending any of his disposable income at all, and if he's saving over $1k a month, that's 24,000 dollars toward a house payment in a year. But yeah, he's the ass hole for saving money to benefit both of them??\n\nAlso, if you consider the ages in this relationship, she was 18, and he was 23 at the start, i doubt she has been covering the majority of the bills in the relationship most of the time", "She was barely 18, man. I know thats an adult but shes still susceptible to grooming by an even older adult", "Didn\u2019t think about it this way, but the math indeed does seem odd.", "I wish it was fabricated but unfortunately this is my current dilemma lol", "Whatever, he's then stuck with rent, maintenance bills AND child support. Doubt it's a better deal...", "Actually i disagree with you on the quiting college bit, I'm sure he wants her to finish it while they live together as he plans on becoming a stay at home mooch, probably will try to trick her into marriage and when they eventually divorce fight for custody and alimony...", "He hasn't stepped in and done his part in 7 years, what makes you think he will start being more equal wit his partner? This guy is trash.", "Notice she wants him to pay more now but when she  starts making more they \"can split the bills evenly\"", "Sure it is, rummy", "Yup, don\u2019t ever have kids outside of a committed marriage! Even then shit can still go wrong, but at least you have a legal contract and all the protections that come with it! For both parties. Playing house is a dangerous situation to put yourself in. Especially having debt and money together! \n\nThis is not me being a prude either.  The data has shown for years that living together prior to marriage leads to higher rates of divorce (there are lots of factors involved). Take your time, date at least a year and experience your partner in various settings including tough/difficult and fun. But definitely don\u2019t put the cart before the horse! Not saying there aren\u2019t exceptions. There are. But why not give yourself the best chances possible!?", "I didn\u2019t say it would be. I just said she literally can\u2019t kick him out.", "It is possible that he is paying for the housing so that he could keep the equity.", "Totally - also he's able to save every month. If (when) they split, she won't have a dime, while he will have his savings.", "I think this is something OP needs to sit down and consider. It was what I was thinking as well, especially when mentioned he didn't want her to go to school.", "You forgot the fact that he expects OP to financially support him as a SAHD when she's finished with her education. \n\nWhat am absolute tool he seems to be. NTA, and OP should really get out, because he's only going to get worse. He allready confirmed as much.", "In my experience, this isn't true. Most courts put fathers on equal footing now, unless there's some good reason not to, e.g., they don't have stable employment, housing, etc. It doesn't have to be equal, just stable. I was a single mom in the not too distant past and met a lot of single dads, most with 50/50 custody or close to it. My sister's ex-husband is an abusive narcissist, and she could not win full custody, even with proof of his abuse and an expensive lawyer. It has to be really egregious to lose custody entirely if the father cares to have it (or use it as a means of continued control).", "Child support can still be enforced if it is outside of a marriage.  \nWhy would living together before marriage lead to divorce? You don't know a person's bad habits until you live with them.  That's when you have to decide of that is worth putting up with for the rest of your life.  The study I found about this was comparing now to the 80s. Who the heck does that kind of comparison?!!  Back then, divorce was not really an option. Now, people are divorcing without a second thought.", "Yeah and charge him full value for it.", "She said rent and not mortgage. Maybe she didn\u2019t properly specify though.", "And she needs to sell one of the cars seeing as she owns and pays for both of them.", "This isn\u2019t what financial abuse looks like. This is just selfish. Financial abuse is when one partner refuses to even let the other partner work to earn their own money, and only give them enough to buy \u201capproved\u201d things. The abused partner usually isn\u2019t even allowed to have their own bank accounts so the other has total financial control over them. This is not that.", "Let\u2019s be realistic, please. Abuse is a completely inappropriate word here. He definitely sounds like a cheap ass jerk! But let\u2019s save the power of that word for when it is actually needed. She is obviously not trapped, she is not a victim. She is weighing her options so that she can make better choices for herself. Now, if she chooses to leave and he has taken control of her money and won\u2019t let her leave or blocks her leaving or controls her through financial means, then yes, that would be abuse. However, none of the data provided indicates that that is the case. \n\nImo, she needs to apply/create clear and healthy financial and personal boundaries and expectations. That will likely include her leaving. The most troublesome part is that his mother is in agreement with him, when it should be her job to tell him straight up that he is being very selfish! \n\nMe personally, I would gladly let her handle the money and share all of the expenses and then split what is left over after paying bills and putting some into savings. \n\nThis is a huge problem with people and relationships in these current times. Everyone is so afraid of what they aren\u2019t getting, that they become selfish and spoil the trust and the relationship. This is equally true for both men and women.", "Yikes!!! Haven\u2019t seen these details.  She needs to untether herself from this joker.", "abusers don\u2019t want to do the smart thing, except for themselves.  but they will sometimes screw themselves over if by doing so they can get away with an act of destruction against their target", "Financial abuse can be limiting the victim to assets. Him saving over half her total income for the month EACH month and refusing to allow her to save anything is financially abusing her in case of emergency. He's creating financial insecurity to prevent her from being able to leave by leaving her with no cushion at the end of each month. It's not super apparent, but it's still abuse.", "I mean, are you even reading what you are writing?? Would you want this for your kids? If not, why would you want this for yourself....this is scary, and you'll regret wasting your years with this guy. He can have all his money SEPARATELY when he is living on his own. 30 years old, and he wants to be a stay at home husband??? Lol no does he not care for retirement or kids' college funds??? \n\nYou are already doing it on your own so it's not going to he hard. His mother is terrible for her advice, she knows better than that...or maybe not that's why he is the way he is smh.", "If her parents live nearby, there is no reason not to move in with them. More adults to help with the kid, and ability to save up for their own place.", "Yes, pay it with the child support she should be collecting", "Therapy helped as well.  I had started for an unrelated incident and ended up working through that and moved onto that issue in my life.\n\nIt's been over 10 years, I am married to a man who treats me with respect and love, with a fantastic child.  Things are good now.", "My dad had 9 kids total. My 2 older brothers were my half brothers. 1 lived with us, 1 with his mom. His mom would leave him home at 5 years old for a week with no power. My dad tried and tried for custody but couldn't get it. Half my dad's paycheck went to that 1 kid, while he busted his ass to still support us. \n\nWhen my ex and I split (we weren't married so no mandated child support) we decided we would figure out the Financials ourselves. I mostly took care of the kids on my own, but if they ever needed anything I would call him and he would make sure he could get me it. He had the kids for summer vacation and we rotated holidays since we live 10hours apart. \n\nI agree, I hate the child support system. I worked with a gal that had heard her friend say she had just gotten a job that paid tips so she could claim she made less and her ex would have to pay more, so she was doing the same thing.", "Hahaha love the single mother mentality l, no she won\u2019t, she\u2019ll just be mad when he eventually moves on to another woman and start his new life while she\u2019s stuck getting passed around by guys who treat her and her kid like the plague \ud83d\ude02. What shitty advice to give a young mother but hey now i know that the motto of single lonely ladies keep other ladies single is a real thing. \u201cMaybe meet a guy who doesn\u2019t suck\u201d with a shit ton of debt and a toddler from a different guy \ud83d\ude02, you go girl and spread this mentality to all your other single mother friends so guys like me can keep em spinnin on that carousel till the day they hit 35 and will be useless to anyone who isn\u2019t looking for cheap \ud83d\udc31\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "He\u2019s not 50% responsible if she can decide to kill it.", "This is assuming that it's his child. If you start with the base assumption that it's her kid from a previous relationship, all of a sudden everything shifts into focus and you can understand why the arrangement currently is what it is."]}
