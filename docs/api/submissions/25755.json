I don\u2019t like to condone leaving, but I get the sense the boyfriend is trying to control OP by restricting the amount of funds she has access to. OP is being financially abused.", "I'd venture that that wouldn't happen...he would have to pay out more for childcare and I suspect he would not enjoy the extra duties all of this would entail.", "It also doesn\u2019t mean that the higher earner automatically gets custody, either. If anything, the most likely scenario is 50/50 and he pays CS because he makes significantly more than she does.", "OP wrote in the post that she owns both cars.", "And cars", "NTA at all and please leave him now \n\nOmg you birthed his child and probably doing most of the housework and cooking and he\u2019s putting you through this", "Bro unless someone has a 30k used car, they aren't paying 500 per month.", "I stated very clearly that they should be paying half. Did you read that? She is the arsehole because she thinks his salary and the money he has left over matters. (And who really believes that the other bills are more than the rent, she likely needs a calculator too).", "Tell me you are misogynistic about women doing maths without telling me. Do you know where she lives and what she spends on bills? No? Then you are in no position to question it. Trust me some places have enormous bills for things that outweigh rent."]}
