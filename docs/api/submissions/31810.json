I'm also I kid at heart so this summer when I found several bags of American Girl doll clothes- I bought them. I collect old dolls that sometimes need clothes but was really hoping an AG doll would show up. Against all odds, one did show up on the shelf a few weeks later. As a kid I wanted an AG doll so badly but they have always been pretty expensive so I never got one. I paid $35 for her took her home and enjoyed dressing her up. My son joined in, dressing up his stuffies. It was so cute that I took a pick and put it on FB. Also, while researching her I found out my doll is a Just Like You #11 which are a bit rare & go for $100+-$300+ online. always fun to find valuable things at the thrift store for cheap!\n\nFast forward- today, a few days after Black Friday I got tagged in a friend of a friend's post. \"Karen\" is asking if anyone has an AG doll to sell. She had tried to buy one online for Black Friday but couldn't find anything within her price range. I instantly had Karen in my DMs offering me $50 for my doll. I declined.  telling her that I don't know why my friend tagged me cuz my doll isn't for sale. \n\nShe replied about how she had promised her 6yr old granddaughter \"Mia\" a doll for Xmas. She was now worried if she ordered a more expensive doll online it wouldn't get to her in time & offered me $70. I again declined & said my doll was something I had wanted at Xmas as a kid & waited a long time for.\n\nKaren immediately countered. \"See you know what it's like not getting the AG you wanted so badly. Please! You could make this Xmas so special for Mia! You can use the money to get a brand new one!\"\n\nI thought about it. I really did but I told her no thanks. Finding mine at the thrift shop felt special- like it was meant to be. I suggested if she was worried about the doll not getting to her in time she could get one of the much cheaper AG knockoff Walmart dolls & have it ready just in case & return it if the AG doll makes it in time.\n\nKaren didn't want to get a cheap doll. She then switched tactics. Asking me if I would even be able to look at my doll again knowing that not selling her meant I ruined Xmas for a little 6yr old girl?\n\nYes I can Karen because when you decide to be manipulative is where I draw the line. I immediately blocked her. maybe this makes me the a-hole but I don't really care. I'm sorry little Mia. I hope you get the doll of your dreams someday.", "created_utc": 1701042012, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/184okt4/aita_for_ruining_a_childs_xmas_cuz_i_refused_to/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They literally sell a bunch at target, if she needs one that badly she can go to target and there's still almost a month till christmas. Sounds like her own personal problem she waited till black friday and realistically a lot of things aren't really on sale and she probably just wanted to be cheap.", "Next time don't entertain the messages. \"Not for sale\" then no more comments.", "You are not in the wrong here. Shame on her for treating you in such a horrid manner. If it meant that much to her she would have ordered a doll long before now. She\u2019s just trying to get a bargain at your expense. Enjoy your doll! Now that I think about it, I doubt if her story is even true. She probably wants to resell it and make some money.", "NTA it\u2019s your doll and it wasn\u2019t for sale", "NTA and also, tell your friend of a friend to not tag you in posts like that anymore.", "NTA. You should have asked for an insane amount, and then turn it around by saying *she's* not willing to make Mia happy.", "NTA. Also, dress the current doll in 3 different outfits and then tell her you found 2 more at thrift stores for $15.", "NTA.  She shouldn't make promises she can't keep.  The only one ruining Mia's Christmas is her grandma, not you.", "NTA \n\nIt is wonderful that she showed you how entitled and predatory she is.  If she had been humble and respectful, you would have felt a bit guilty.  It's so much easier to say no to an AH. Enjoy your found treasure.", "Nta\n\nShe ruined the Xmas for the child by promising something she couldn't/ wouldn't get. I'm sure she could find one on ebay for twice the price of new, or could order a new one with express delivery, she's just too cheap to do that. \n\nI sure if you told her you'd sell it for the price of a new one she'd turn down your offer.", "NTA your not in anyway shape or form. You never offered it, never said to anyone you\u2019d be looking at selling it. You didn\u2019t ruin a Christmas. It\u2019s the lady who\u2019s the A because I genuinely feel like there no harm in asking if you\u2019d be interested and then offering an amount but pushing after being told no is wrong. And tbh if she knew it was that big of a deal she should have been looking way earlier she\u2019s looking for a quick fix to something and you obviously cannot help her with that.\nDon\u2019t doubt yourself your in the right x", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
