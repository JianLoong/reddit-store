Or maybe they are really getting along woth New bf and feel less connected to you\n\nWhat is important here is that you need to understand what life is going to be like now. If they ever need something, they could be asking you, but if there was something you wish for them not to have or not to do, you will always be met by \" you're not my/their father.\" \n\nYou will never again have a say in their education.

Why do you want to be a door mat for the ex and allow her to continue to use anything you pay for?  Let the new BF pay for the subscriptions or she can get accounts in her own name. Allowing them to continue using these passwords and accounts is just asking for trouble in the long run. \n\nYou do realize that it is very possible for them to change your passwords and lock you out of your own accounts?  Change ALL your passwords - email, accounts, EVERYTHING!  \n\nThen send the kids a text telling them you either cancelled your accounts or had to change all of your passwords so they won't have access to the streaming services anymore.  But don't send that text until AFTER you've done this - otherwise they may lock you out of your account. \n\nGet the kids a gift subscription to one or more of the streaming services they use as a Christmas present (give it to them early if you like or don't change the passwords until right before Christmas, then send the gift with a note that you changed your passwords)- then once the gift is up they need to continue to pay for it if they want to keep it and you are not on the hook for it.", "Also to add on.

Password safety: you should be changing those passwords REGULARLY.\n\n\nOP is NTA.\n\n\nAlso I just want to point out this is bad password safety unless you use a password manager, which really does more all around than just changing them regularly.\n\nWithout a password manager, regular password changing (especially at high frequency like 3-6 months or even less) typically causes people to adopt worse security habits. It leads to more calls to IT Help Desks asking for password resets saying they can't remember the 3rd password they made this year. Research has shown it and Microsoft advises against it. \n\nFocus with starting with a password manager - 1Password or BitWarden (never LastPass.) 2FA also does more than frequent password changing - but something good in the long run.", "Thanks for mansplaining password safety. I work in cybersecurity, and I can guarantee you that there is a reason most corporate environments force password changes on a 3-6 month cycle.  That said, you\u2019re not wrong that bad habits with passwords are dangerous (such as using your first name followed by an increasing number - Joseph1, Joseph2, etc) and that password managers can be helpful (not sure why you prefer 1Password & BitWarden over LastPass, but hey\u2026 whatever makes you happy). The trend now is MFA, which everyone should be using whenever possible.\n\nBut yes, DONE CORRECTLY it is safer to change your passwords periodically and to have different passwords for each system you login to (password managers are VERY helpful for this, that was an excellent recommendation), that way if a website ever does have a security breach and your username/password is compromised, it minimizes the risk that someone might compromise your account(s). You\u2019d be surprised just how much credential validation / credential stuffing has become a constant problem for login endpoints.\n\nMost password managers have a built-in feature that will help you select a randomized password, which reduces the risk of repeated credentials across multiple logins.  This reduces the risk of your accounts being compromised.", ">Thanks for mansplaining password safety. I work in cybersecurity, \n\nNot to be patronizing, but you're looking for that word - patronizing. One has to be a man to mansplain.\n\nI work in IT and have coworkers and friends who do infosec & cybersecurity. But we don't need to have a pissing contest.\n\nNot everyone reading it works in cybersecurity.\n\n> That said, you\u2019re not wrong that bad habits with passwords are dangerous \n\nWhich was my point. Changing your password frequently (especially more frequently) without a password manager is bad security habits. If you're using a password manager, I have no issue. I encourage it!\n\n> (not sure why you prefer 1Password & BitWarden over LastPass, but hey\u2026 whatever makes you happy). \n\nLastPass has a record of security incidents, two within just the last 6 months with one being the other day.

You need to unpack your statistical biases my friend.\n\nIt's ok to be wrong on the internet but you gotta know when to stop arguing back at people for rightly calling you out.
