During the 8 years we were together I became a father to her kids ( not legally but they are my kids). After the break up we were friends for several months but I haven't talked to her since June, and the kids haven't really talked to me for about 2 months. The kids are teens (15/16/17) so I understand they are probably just being teens and not worried about talking to me.\nMy ex and kids still use all my Streaming accounts and she use my Amazon Prime to buy stuff for herself and new boyfriend. I want to just remove access to all them since no one is talking to me or basically in my life, and yes I have reached out with no response. It bugs me that I am paying for these subscriptions and her and her new BF are benefiting from it, but I also don't want to take these subscriptions away from my kids. I also feel like taking away the Amazon now would make me an AH because it's Christmas time. But I balso know I need to move on and stop allowing myself to be taken advantage of.\nI would just let the kids have the passwords but if course she would get it some how anyway so I feel like I either remove it entirely or not at all.\nWould I be an AH for changing all the passwords?\n\nUpdate: I want to thank you all for the positive feedback and suggestions. I have begun changing passwords and removing devices from my accounts. I am not offering any explanation or giving any heads up because you guys have made me realize I don't need too. I am not going to lie, I still feel like a petty AH even though I shouldn't, but that's just my personality. \n\nTo address a couple questions, she was using her own cards to buy things. I didn't really mind until she added her new BF to the address list and that's when I started this whole idea of moving on, pathetic I know. \n\nWhen I say the kids were being teenagers and not contact me I meant they had their own lives going on and I just am not high on their list of priorities, I believe we have a good relationship still, but their mom needs to provide them streaming since I am not involved right now.\n\nAgain thank you guys for all your advice, I appreciate you guys!", "created_utc": 1669953580, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zaaojq/aita_for_not_allowing_my_ex_to_use_my/", "score": 777, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Why do you want to be a door mat for the ex and allow her to continue to use anything you pay for?  Let the new BF pay for the subscriptions or she can get accounts in her own name.

Password safety: you should be changing those passwords REGULARLY.\n\n\nOP is NTA.\n\n\nAlso I just want to point out this is bad password safety unless you use a password manager, which really does more all around than just changing them regularly.\n\nWithout a password manager, regular password changing (especially at high frequency like 3-6 months or even less) typically causes people to adopt worse security habits. It leads to more calls to IT Help Desks asking for password resets saying they can't remember the 3rd password they made this year. Research has shown it and Microsoft advises against it. \n\nFocus with starting with a password manager - 1Password or BitWarden (never LastPass.) 2FA also does more than frequent password changing - but something good in the long run.", "Thanks for mansplaining password safety. I work in cybersecurity, and I can guarantee you that there is a reason most corporate environments force password changes on a 3-6 month cycle.  That said, you\u2019re not wrong that bad habits with passwords are dangerous (such as using your first name followed by an increasing number - Joseph1, Joseph2, etc) and that password managers can be helpful (not sure why you prefer 1Password & BitWarden over LastPass, but hey\u2026 whatever makes you happy). The trend now is MFA, which everyone should be using whenever possible.\n\nBut yes, DONE CORRECTLY it is safer to change your passwords periodically and to have different passwords for each system you login to (password managers are VERY helpful for this, that was an excellent recommendation), that way if a website ever does have a security breach and your username/password is compromised, it minimizes the risk that someone might compromise your account(s). You\u2019d be surprised just how much credential validation / credential stuffing has become a constant problem for login endpoints.\n\nMost password managers have a built-in feature that will help you select a randomized password, which reduces the risk of repeated credentials across multiple logins.  This reduces the risk of your accounts being compromised.", ">Thanks for mansplaining password safety. I work in cybersecurity, \n\nNot to be patronizing, but you're looking for that word - patronizing.

It's not clear if she's using his cards, but she absolutely could.", "Password managers are not safe even with 2fa. Remotely storing all your passwords isn't a great idea,  they are prime target for hackers. You won't be the first person who loses all their passwords all at once. As IT security guy I always advice against storing work / bank / email passwords in a manager.", "I stopped reading after mainsplaining.", ">Not to be patronizing, but you're looking for that word - patronizing.\n\nI mean, if we're going to get super uppity about root words for linguistics, patronizing derives from patron, or father, and basically is an older form of 'mansplaining.'\n\nMaybe get off your high horse and treat people you don't know with a bit of respect if you're going to stick your foot in your mouth.", "Why did you assume they are a man? Why should they have assumed you are a woman?", "But this is the most delightfully esoteric and emotionally charged thread I\u2019ve read in ages. Don\u2019t stop it! I\u2019m getting popcorn brb", "NTA  \n\n\nThese are your accounts, not hers. If you feel too bad for the kids, you can always leave them access to the Netflix/Hulu accounts (even creating specific profiles only for them), and only cancel the Amazon access. Meanwhile, don't feel bad because Christmas is coming and they might need Amazon for gifts and stuff, you already contacted them about that and they couldn't even be bothered to answer you back...", "NTA\n\nYour relationship is over and it's healthy and sensible to disentangle yourselves from each other, especially financially. \n\nI think your caution is warranted because suddenly your kids lose access to their shows and their mother is probably going to paint you as a villain. Best way to do this is just to say \"it will end on this date. I'm cancelling x service, changing the password, etc.\". Gives them plenty of time to get their own service set up. For the services you mentioned, anyone with a credit/debit card and internet is about 10 minutes away from immediate access to the service.", "Don't worry about prime. Your ex can get a free trial for a month and be just fine for the holiday. I absolve you of all guilt\nNTA", "NTA remove there access to your accounts, they aren\u2019t part of your life anymore so they don\u2019t deserve it. I removed my ex and his family from all of my pretty much as soon as he dumped me. Don\u2019t feel bad removing there access", "NTA. It was one thing when you were with her and raising her kids. She needs to get her own streaming services. Are you also paying for the items she is buying? Let her take care of all of that for herself and her kids. Cut her off. This is also for your security.\n\nEdit: Make sure you change all passwords, including the email addresses the accounts are tied to.", "NTA... I had all sorts of people attached to my accounts and got worried because they are attracted to credit cards. So I sent out a text that I was letting all my accounts expire. And I did. Eventually I made some new, but didnt share.", "NTA. You need to remove it before things get added by 'accident' and ur on the hook. You don't need the added irritation. Moving on is a lot better, because that connection isn't something you want to leave open. U don't need to explain, call or give a heads up, just start shutting down their way into your things. If she can get on your Amazon, usually they can get on ur banking accounts, so that's a good reason to shut it down. Good luck", "NTA - No . . . they are just using YOUR money to buy themselves what they want. They could empty your account and still not talk to you or THANK you for the gifts. Time to move on.", "NTA, change the passwords.", "Let her and her new boyfriend pay for their own! It's their house, their responsibility!", "NTA\n\nI get why you feel apprehensive, but it is what it is.  She isn't your partner, you don't owe her any of that.  I'm sorry the kids will miss out, but it kind of is what it is.", "Dear OP, definitely you're NTA. Despite your love for the kids, life has to move on. You're love won't be defined by allowing their access or not, but by being present in each others life, which is not happening at the moment. \nMy suggestion is: change the passwords and live your life, those who stay in it, are because they really want to be there. \nIf they have money to order products, they can pay for come subscriptions, believe me. \nIf you came here, asking for strangers advices, is because this subject has been annoying you and is not fair. Don't waste your mental health for those who can perfectly live without you. \nContinuing on it is a slippery slope. I really root for you leave this situation and be happy with the ones who deserves your appreciation.", "NTA.  Sharing those accounts with people who no longer live with you is considered theft.  Amazon in particular is very strict about this.  I share a Netflix account with my adult son, but we pay extra for an additional user.  If you want the kids to have accounts, you can set up an account for them, but honestly, I think it's the fact that your ex is buying stuff for her new boyfriend with your account is what is bothering you.   It would bother me also.", "NTA and let your computer randomly generate your passwords. Write them down/save them.", "NTA. They are not entitled to your accounts.", "NTA\n\nsorry to break it to you but they are not your kids bud. They are old enough to know better than to ignore you. Don't fall in that trap. Go live your life, you are still young enough.", "You should never share an Amazon account. They have a \"family share\" option that gives other accounts most of the Prime benefits.", "No they aren't. You add a family member to your account and they get the same benefits and their own login page and account. It is totally separate. My sister brought me something on her/I'm paying for it account and I had to ask her for the password to her account so that I could see the tracking for something she brought me.\n\nIt doesn't show up in your account at all. You might pay for the account but Amazon doesn't give you, the person who is paying for it the account details.", "The ex or her new BF should pay for a subscription if they really want to stream anything", "Also to add on even more, you have been able to get a free one month trial of Amazon prime for over a decade. There is no real limitation, just make a new account with a new email. Hell, it doesn't even have to be a new email, just throw a period somewhere in your username if you use Gmail (ie: usern.ame@gmail) .\n\nYou wouldnt mess up Christmas on their side.", "It doesn't work that way. See above.", "All of them and when you  invite them to your account it is private and exclusive to them. Different logins and credit cards. A whole other private account.", "They got breached. Meaning your password repository is in the possession of someone else. I haven't looked too closely at them or the breach, as I'm a KeePass user, but I would guess they had them encrypted, but if your LastPass password can be cracked all your passwords are vulnerable.\n\nCompanies report breaches because they are legally obligated to in most cases and even then some try and wait as long as possible or hide the true damage. Just look up the Ubiquiti Cloud Key issue. That's not to say that LastPass is guilty of this but for something as crucial as a password manager, I would never use a cloud-based solution.", "They've had numerous security breaches over the years. Just because they appear to be o n top of it, doesn't mean that your info isn't already out there.", "They've had numerous security breaches over the years. Just because they  \n appear to be o n top of it, doesn't mean that your info isn't already   \nout there.", "did you miss the part where one has to be a man to mansplain? That patronizing is more apt?\n\nI did nothing to \"disrespect\" them. I simply pointed out that telling people who don't have password managers to change their password frequently is potentially bad advice. \n\nGiving criticism isn't disrespectful. It says more about you if you take criticism as being disrespectful.", "NTA\n\nYou need to cut the cord. Its unfortunate, but you need to put this chapter to rest and start a new one.", "NTA. You're a really decent person for allowing them to stay on the subs you pay for. Don't feel guilty AT ALL.", "NTA, plus if I may say, Netflix is going to be charging for any additional profiles on your account starting January 2023. \n\nMy household had 3 accounts, mine, my son, and my grandson. This is part of the reason I canceled it.", "NTA.  You have no obligation to do this and you are being taken advantage of.  You've tried reaching out to the kids but you don't get a response.   It also doesn't sound like you have any visitation rights here so you don't have the ability to \"share\" with the kids since they don't come for a visit.\n\nYour ex has apparently moved on with a new bf, it's totally fine for you to move on as well.", "They are taking advantage of you. When my ex roommate kicked me out because her boyfriend was making passes at me while she was out of town. I had my brother come get me away from the situation. I had them both on my streaming services so I deleted them from all of them.", "NTA lmao this is so obvious", "NTA, she's out of your life, then she should be out of your streaming services too.\n\nmaybe I'm petty but if you're not getting anything from her, she shouldn't keep benefiting from the stuff you pay.", "Right! Credit card info is saved there. Change that one first. They can sign up\nFor their own account if they want streaming and free shipping. It only takes a couple minutes", "That depends on how you set it up. If she is using his sign in, they\u2019ll then they are on the same page with all the same info. We have both at my house. We only pay for one prime subscription. But I can log in with my husband\u2019s email and password- and see all his orders and credit card info, as well as his shipping addresses. When I log in with my email (I was the added family member) I can\u2019t see his stuff.\n\nSince the OP specifically said he can see her orders and that she added her bf\u2019s address, clearly she is logging in with his username/password, so she can also see his credit card info or order things with his card. \n\nHe needs to shut this down now.", "At one of my jobs, we were forced to change our password every 90 days, and the password had to be completely different from any password we had used before. After having been there for almost 2 years, I could never remember what password was the most recent and it was an overall headache. I hated that job. (For many reasons, not just that)", "It depends on how they have it set up.  My sister accidentally used my mom's card once (it wasn't a big deal because she just venmoed her the money).  If she's just logging into the same account she could have accessm", "NTA! My son\u2019s father used to use my Netflix and then he started dating a woman that spoke a diff language and it kept changing it on MY device to her language.  I finally just changed it and have not heard a thing!", "NTA\u2014your ex thinks you are a rug that she wipes her feet on. Change all the passwords and never speak to her again.", "NTA.  Not only is the ex not your problem anymore, your accounts can potentially be terminated since they often have rules against sharing the accounts.", "I mean, it sounds like he wants to maintain a relationship with the kids down the line if that's what they want. Blocking their numbers will just sever that relationship entirely", "LOL, you're not the only one who's allowed to talk about cybersecurity. And people are allowed to comment on your posts. The poster you're replying to was adding information to your answer. Frequent password changes have the benefits you mentioned, and they *also* have the drawback the other poster mentioned.", "Will you do the same? Seems lots of people disagree with you here so will you take the L?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOr do you have an example from another reddit post where you took the L? I mean it is a vital adult skill apparently.", "Yeah people feel really strongly about their method of password security and that everyone else.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso the continue devaluing of mansplaining where it is a real thing but it is misused so much it might as well not be."]}
