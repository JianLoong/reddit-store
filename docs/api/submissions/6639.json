It made him more cautious of stuff. We were super close. His wife, Nina, was not made aware of it. Then the worst happened. He was a firefighter and it was always in his mind that it could happen. Nina made it clear she was unhappy that most of his money was left to the kids and that she could not touch it.\n\nShe remarried a year later and her husband, Adam, is the biggest asshole in the world.

Adam would try to act as though he was my big brother and would say some truly insensitive things that I just had to let go.
