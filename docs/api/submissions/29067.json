A week ago I celebrated the point that I graduated for my Master's  degree in information sciences together with my 27th birthday (27M speaking OFC).  What happened was the following.\n\nI had planned a party for me and my friends from my hometown and university city to come over on saturday and then sunday my family would come over for me and my mothers (56F) birthday as we share the same birthday.\n\nThe birthday for me and my friends was a lot of fun, I mentioned it was also my mums birthday and they got her presents as well, as I thought it would be nice for her as well as she had recently undergone some tough surgery. However, some of the stuff I got for the part were still left over so we decided to use that for the party on the day after.\n\nEnter the sunday and meet my aunt (61F). Recently (3 years ago) her husband died and as she does not have a driver's license, I usually pick her up as she lives quite close to my hometown and I can get to drive a car so I dont get too rusty behind the wheel. Other things that you need to know is that likes to (roughly translated the saying) \"get first row seats for a dime\". Subsequently, that day I got into a bit of traffic and I was three minutes late. That was not appreciated by her and on the ride home (15 minutes) I only got complaints on the music (Mumford & Sons).\n\nAt home, the fun continued. She got my mum a present and I got a firm handshake, which kinda bothered me as she also knew it was my birthday. For clarification, I dont really mind the value of a present, just the idea that you thought of something nice to give me.\n\nSubsequently we got complains on the \"cheap wine and snacks\" as we used the store brand stuff from the day before as we had a big party and I didnt have the money to get a lot of premium stuff. The issue for me here was that she kept nagging on about it to my other aunts during the afternoon.\n\nHowever what led to the AITA situation was the following: My dad mentioned during a conversation that I had with him and my aunt that I was taking them and my sister out for dinner  after the graduation ceremony for my master's degree for a food style that he really enjoys. My aunt was directly interested in joining.\n\nNow the breaking point comes, she constantly kept suggesting that she should join as well. These suggestions became much less subtle over time. She also was only interested in joining for dinner and not the graduation ceremony. Most of my reasons that she could not join were \"I can only bring 3 people to the ceremony\" and \"I want to spent time with my direct family as we dont see each other as often anymore\". As she kept going on, I said: \"Please stop asking, I do not want you coming along as I feel you are only interested in monetary things and not about me\" (She could not remember how old I got).

Your aunt appears to be a giant AH, but I doubt she's going to ask here to find out. If someone I was giving a lift to complained about me being 3 minutes late (and the music), it would be the last ride they'd get from me.", "NTA - Your aunt is pretty braizen to just assume that you would be okay to just let her invite herself along.", "NTA\n\nShe: \n\n* Got a free ride to the shindig\n* Complained about the music\n* Complained about cheap snacks, which you thoughtfully provided\n* didn't get you a present\n* snubbed your nice acts to her siblings\n* invited herself to a small, private dinner\n* pushed and pushed and pushed about inviting herself\n\nShe can't complain, belittle, and be rude to someone and expect hospitality in return.", "It was quite rude of her to ask to join an outing to which she had not been invited.  I think you responded the only way you could to someone pestering you for an invitation *on your dime*. Presumably you'd also have to provide transportation for her as well.  NTA, but your aunt truly needs a refresher course on manners and etiquette!", "NTA, she sounds like a handful. And she made it very clear she does not care about you whatsoever. She only complained at you, didn\u2019t acknowledge your birthday, and didn\u2019t thank you for the ride. Also she made it clear she didn\u2019t think about you or your graduation at all, she literally only cared about the fancy dinner. \n\nYour reasons are very valid.", "NTA. Yes, you were blunt and maybe a little too honest where you didn't need to be, but this is what happens when people like your Aunt are continually rude and won't take a hint. \n\nI have family like your Aunt and I think people \"snap\" (as I have at times), because they let too many things go by or they take things too personally. So maybe let her dumb comments about cheap booze and other things roll off your back because you know how greedy she is, but also don't do her favors if all she does is complain. And if she's being directly rude to you, gently call her out in the moment so you don't blow up later.", "NTA.  Your aunt was dismissive and rude until she saw an opportunity she wanted to take advantage of.  You don't have to celebrate milestones with some who doesn't appreciate you.  Your aunt probably gets away with this behavior toward family,  where anyone else would be done with her after the first insult.", "[deleted]", "NTA, but most aunts and uncles won\u2019t remember your exact age (here\u2019s a shocker, neither will your own parents after you are an adult as well as grandparents, siblings, etc.).

I usually pick music that is not too intense when giving someone a lift (Like I dont listen to metal when giving a lift to non-metal fans). Normally my parents get premium brands during these relatively small gatherings, but we had leftover beer and stuff from the night before that was cooled so why not finish it. They bought premium stuff and I got (still decent tasting) store brand stuff for the larger party the night before.  For the present idc what you get me, as long as you have thought about me, as this is a bit of an issue as me and my mum share a bday and usually celebrate it together. It was kinda rough to see that some of my friends who never met my mum got her something nice and I couldnt even get a card from someone who claims she cares about me.", "We kinda deal with it though. As she is a widow and does not have a lot of people to talk to, my parents invite her over for this kind of stuff. But they are slowly getting fed up with her antics", "The text limit didnt allow me to, but one important aspect was that I asked: \"What degree did I graduate in?\" and she couldnt even form a remote response (I graduated in the IT field) despite me mentioning it several times during the convo", "I'm dutch, so we end up being pretty direct regardless ;). It was a situation where she kept firing the question and I just wanted it to stop.", "Not too blunt, she got what she paid for.", "We kinda deal with it as she's a widow, but I dont wanna spend 50ish bucks on someone not even showing remote forms of interest", "Edited it, didn't really realize this. English isnt my primary language", "We've invited her for my \"27th\" and my mums \"56th\" birthday, so that should be clear", "Dumb, pointless comment haha\n\nI'm sorry your parents can't remember how old you are.", "The broken record works really well in situations like this, but it takes longer to take effect. \"This dinner is to celebrate my graduation with my immediate family.\" \"This dinner is to celebrate my graduation with my immediate family.\" \n\nAnd for excluding her from future parties that you throw \"After hearing your comments about previous events, I don't think it would be up to your standards and we wouldn't want you to have an unpleasant experience.\" \n\nThis translates to \"If you gripe about it, you don't get to do it again\" but gives her less to get outraged on social media about.", "Sometimes you had to put some English into the punch.  In auntie's case, she needed the entire Oxford Dictionary.  \n\nOP should keep some salt handy to pour down her aunt's back.", "I have heard that the Dutch are direct so in that case you were probably nicer than you could have been LOL.", "If you are dutch... you are a compassionate saint for it taking so long before saying something.  NTA.\n\nFrom an American perspective it would be a little more questionable.", "Sometimes you need to choose self respect over accommodating family.  It's a PITA though, I get it.

I probably would have went with, \"I just want it to be immediate family and want to spend some quality time with them.\" Or something like that. As I assume them = your mom and dad, then your sister. \n\nThe fact that she kept going on and on about going with you guys is mind blowing. You would think since you didn't respond, she'd take a hint or read the room LOL she kind of set herself up for that one.", "\"Getting first row seats for a dime\"...I'm definitely adopting that phrase.\n\nAlso, NTA.", "NTA, just dumb. That would actually be fantastic of you, it would be so much easier for me to split the bill with you than pay it all myself, we\u2019ll co-host.", "There was a more diplomatic way of doing this but you aren\u2019t obligated to include her in a dinner just for immediate family.", "NTA. Glad you told her. I would\u2019ve lied or ghosted her. You\u2019re a better man than I.", "Being a widow doesn't gives you a free pass to be a B to your familly. In my opinion."]}
