We bonded through meeting during both of our first pregnancies. She is having a three day Indian American wedding. When she originally asked me to be a bridesmaid she told me the wedding was in the city we live in. I agreed to be in the wedding because I had a young baby and knew it would be in the city I lived in. She asked if I would be willing to be a bridesmaid if they decided to do a cruise for the wedding. I told her no. \n\nThen it came time to buy dresses. She told me we would have to buy one bridesmaid dress. I bought that dress which was around $100.00. Then a few months later she tells me I would need to buy another dress for another one of the days of the wedding. I told her I would but that would be the only other thing I could afford. I buy that dress. She tells me she\u2019s decided on another dress instead so I return that dress and buy the new one for $100.00. She then had another dress that she is having made for all of us at her own expense. \n\nNow she wants to move the wedding from where we live to a location four hours away and we would be responsible for getting a hotel for three nights. Not only is that more money than I had planned on spending but I have a six month old who I will still be breastfeeding and I don\u2019t want to leave her for three days. She also hasn\u2019t reached out to me in five months. Am I the asshole for backing out? \n\nI feel bad most about the dress she is having made.For additional context she has canceled two previous weddings where the bridesmaids had already bought their dresses and cancelled bachelorette parties to Vegas that were already paid for. So she has a pattern of making changes and more that may come.

Seriously\u2026 how do you keep up with her indecision? I would\u2019ve lost my shit with the dress changes. You know your finances better than anyone else. If you feel this wedding is going to burden your finances, get out of the wedding party. It sounds like She\u2019s going to keep changing her mind about her wedding. You don\u2019t have to put up with that.", "NTA. she's moved the goalposts, several times. And she has form - has cancelled not one but \ud83d\udd5d two previous weddings!\nYou never signed up for the four-hours-away wedding and she can't expect you to go to it. Just say no.", "NTA. I'd back out now before you throw away any more money because by the sounds of it, that wedding ain't going to happen.", "NTA, but communicate this as soon as possible. Basically, she knows you have a small child and you understand that wedding plans change, but you can't attend anymore.", ">location four hours away and we would be responsible for getting a hotel for three nights.\n\nNTA", "NTA one little bit.  This bride is all about herself.  You are her friend, but you are more all about your family, baby, and financial situation, understandably.  These two worlds are not matching up well at the moment.  \n\nA bride cannot reasonably continue to milk those she has asked to be her attendants.  Let her know ASAP that you regretfully have to bow out now as you cannot manage what she is now asking.  There is NO shame in that.  This bride does NOT have the right to plan things without your input and then just present you with the bill, in essence.  She needs to be more considerate of her attendants.\n\nIn no way are you a bad person or friend for not being able to accommodate all that your friend, the bride, is now asking of you.  Bow out gracefully and regretfully.  You are a young mother whose first commitment is to your baby and your family, not your friend, the bride.  Changing the venue to out of town puts a last minute, huge expense on you that you should feel totally okay backing away from.", "NTA. Get out before you sink more money. This woman is inconsiderate", "INFO: is she marrying the same guy as from the cancelled weddings?  Why were they cancelled?", "If she's allowed to change her mind constantly, so are you.\n\nNTA", "No, you aren't TA\n\nThe bride is inconsiderate and you have reached your limit on what you can accommodate so it is time to let her know and she can find someone else.  Let her know sooner than later!", "NTA. Back out right now so she has time to find another bridesmaid your size!", "OMG RUN.  Do not walk.  Away from this person.", "NTA but why should you feel bad about her paying for a dress when she\u2019s the one who made a change that made it impossible for you to attend? She wasted $200 of your money and you had nothing to do with her indecisiveness.", "NTA by any stretch of the imagination.\n\nAnd just to add - hopefully this does not happen and she handles your change of plans gracefully. But if she throws any sort of hissy fit when you let her know you will not be attending - that is a her problem, not a you problem. Her emotional regulation is not your business or responsibility. Your only responsibility here is to let her know so that she can continue making (and changing) her plans without you.", "NTA. You met her during your pregnancy and your baby will only be 6 months if the wedding happens. She hasn\u2019t been in touch with you the last 5 months. She isn\u2019t a close friend and this isn\u2019t worth the drama.", "Any thoughts from anyone regarding the dress she\u2019s having made for me?
