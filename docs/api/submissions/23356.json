It is very possible that you could have come back and not have had a son anymore come morning. He could have ended up dead. I suggest you drill that into her head her immature and frankly childish behavior put her son at risk Who is himself a child and not capable of making mature decisions. That's why he's a kid. She's the adult and should be able to recognize that. I also think she really needs to go to counseling because that is not the correct way to handle that situation at all.

I too would be furious if my SO had done this to our child. Locking him out over night isn't going to teach him a lesson, it's just going to show him that he can't rely on mom when he makes bad choices. Teens experiment, it's part of life and growing up.

That means she would do that again. You need to put a hard stop to that.\n\nMy inclination would be to suggest making a police report and having them come over and let your wife know what would happen to her if she tried that again. The problem with that approach is that once you start the ball rolling, you never know where it will stop. You want her to take it seriously, but you don't want her actually arrested and potentially prosecuted for that first offense.\n\nETA:\n\nA different idea.

Seems unlikely to me.\n\nIrrelevant to the whole thing, but for the record, drinking laws in the US are asinine and people who freak out about underage drinking are typically either extremely obedient to the law(gross) or have intense religious reasons to oppose drinking(also gross imo). There are cultures and countries around the world where 16 year olds have a beer with their friends without the sky falling. Learning to drink responsibly at a gradual pace seems much healthier to me than zero tolerance until 21, at which point WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I CAN DOWN THIS WHOLE MAG OF JACK MYSELF, I'M INVINCIBLE WOOOOOOOO TIME TO DRIVE HOME I DON'T EVEN FEEL IT WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\n\nJust my two cents.", "Question: Does he do this often or was it his first time? I only ask because while it seems innocent, I have a brother who (in his teens and through most of his 20's) would constantly get drunk to the point of disrupting everyone in the house and it became a huge issue. If it's just once I don't get why she reacted like that. Seemed like overkill", "As a parent, your wife is TA, and just a horrid parent.\n\nWhat did she thing were the possible outcomes - short term and long term - of kicking her son out while impaired?  It's ludicrously stupid, just because she couldn't handle her feelings about him doing something predictably wrong.\n\nNTA, and she's caused long term harm.", "NTA, everytime I hear about this shit I think about Leslie Mahaffy and the absolute guilt her parents feel every single day of their lives.", "I'm a mom and hell no you're NTA... your wife is a real piece of work...", "As a mom myself I would rather my teen child call me and ask me to come pick them up completely drunk than not feel like I am their safe place, even though they did something they shouldn't have. You can be disappointed without being abusive. NTA. Your wife is, though.", "ESH, should\u2019ve left with him. That kid is now emotionally scarred for life. Locked out of the only home he knew by those he trusted. It\u2019ll be a bit more than alcohol to worry about in the future.", "Usually the punishment would be keeping the teenage IN the house (grounding) not locking them out! NTA", "NTA this shit is how you lose custody of your child \nIt seems like your wife never got to enjoy her teen age years my guess is that she never left the house past six or she would get grounded  or she just never left the house", "NTA at all. Every Ontarian reading this had the same visceral reaction: Leslie Mahaffy. We know what happens when parents lock their children out...", "NTA. \n\nWhen I was in high school many of my friends had a rule that if they didn't make it home by curfew they weren't allowed to come home. I'm not sure how that is an effective rule. Their parents said \"if you won't respect my rules, you don't get to expect the house\". Is that your wife's mindset?", "NTA, she definitely is though.", "NTA! Wasn't there a news story of a mother that did this to her daughter, and the girl ended up going missing? I cannot imagine locking a door with my child on the other side.", "NTA\n\nHis mother has just insured that he will never call her for help for anything if he needs it.  And in saying that I really hope he understands that he can call you because kids do dumb shit and he needs to know he has someone who isn't going to hate him for making a mistake.", "NTA in anyway and you need to make sure your wife is aware she is a huge NTA and has likely destroyed the trust between her and your son, and possibly their entire relationship.\n\nIt's a gross overreaction from her. When I was 16 and got caught drinking underage, my Mum's preferred punishment was to wake me up with ABBA blasting as she vacuum cleaned my bedroom at 7am, with the lights glaring and my hangover giving me shooting pains. She would follow it up with a breakfast of food bound to make me feel sick. It worked a hell of a lot better than making me sleep in the cold outside would have.", "NTA - your wife sucks tho.", "Teens are gonna teen. I would be more concerned about where my kid slept then if he had a couple sips of beer.", "NTA. Tell your wife to look up Paul Bernardo in Ontario.   He and his wife are evil, murdering people.  They tortured and killed two girls and the wife's own sister.  One of the girls that was murdered was 16 and locked out by her parents one night to teach her a lesson.  She was taken by them and dead  3 days later.  You and your wife do not want to have that guilt on you.", "That\u2019s what the Tough Love people suggested doing\u2026unless of course it was freezing cold or you live near animals that like to eat 16 year old drunk boys", "Maybe your wife should ask Debbie Mahaffey what locking a kid out at night does? Maybe she won't be such a retchet mother", "NTA , it seems like your wife thinks she was a angel growing up", "NTA - teenagers do dumb stuff all of the time. All this did was show that he can\u2019t trust her and make him sneaky. He\u2019s still a child and shouldn\u2019t have been forced to sleep on the streets as punishment", "NTA.  Stand your ground on this.  What she did was fucked up, and just all around bad parenting.", "Great, now your son will drink behind her back and will not return home out of fear for her reaction if he\u2019s too drunk or call her. He might not even call you when he\u2019s too drunk in case you tell her, Good job mom. You\u2019re NTA", "Your son is 16 and should experience consequences for drinking, but your wife's choice of consequence was inappropriate, excessive, and dangerous. NTA.", "NTA. Where I live there was a 16 year old that snuck out and got drunk. His parents accidentally locked him out not knowing he had snuck out. It was the winter time and well the people who took him home drunk had just left him outside his house. He had no way of getting in and froze to death\u2026 anything can happen when your drunk and all this taught your son was to not trust his mother when he\u2019s in a dangerous situation.", "We were in the pub at 16. This is very strange.", "NTA. Anything could have happened to him out there he was vulnerable and needed protecting! I saw a true crime case like this and it didn\u2019t end well", "NTA. Not saying this will happen to you, but a similar thing happened to my cousin, and because he wasnt in the right state of mind, he went back to hang with his not-so-good friends, and got arrested the same night. He is now in jail for a 10+ year sentence.\n\nI cannot understand parents that kick their kids out for little things like being drunk. It happens at that age. Kids make TONS of mistakes from 16-22, they're supposed to be able to come back home and learn from the PARENTS why that wasnt okay, so they dont have to go through what my cousin did.", "Your wife overreacted in such a huge way. Does this kid have a history of this? Is there a reason she should be so harsh, unreasonable and rash that you didn't include?\n\nYour wife endangered your child, who isn't far off from being an adult and deciding if he talks to her at all, for something so minor that I doubt he will ever be honest about his imperfections with her again. This was me as a teen, and now my mom only gets sanitized lies about my life.\n\nYou are very much NTA.", "Exactly. Why not handle the problem like a decent parent--from a place of understanding/acceptance, healing, and recovery?--but instead, she has a whole episode and does the complete opposite by discarding her own child without having a single concern for his safety. I feel like she made this all about herself and her selfish emotions.", "You do know peer pressure is very standard amongst kids", "I would say they both did things to hurt the trust. \n\nThe difference is, you should expect your kid to experiment with drinking around his age, and not have a crazy person freakout when it happens.", "This is a good point. She needs to understand that this is pretty objectively bad judgment.\n\nThe most constructive way that I have seen parents handle this situation is to get them home (in some scenarios it is picking them up from a party) and get them to bed, no questions asked. Let them know that you will talk about it in the morning and discuss consequences.", "I came to say this very thing! Also, OP's wife is acting like a child- no rational adult would think it's a good idea to leave a drunk teen outdoors unattended. NTA", "I'm in Ontario and just posted the same!", "That was exactly what I was going to comment!", "What she did is bordeline abusive.", "Where did you read that OP \u201cset his son up?\u201d", "I'm sorry that happened to you. I have always made sure my son knows he can trust me and I've been reassuring him of that since this happened.", "I second this wholeheartedly.", "When my friend was 16 she once called her dad from a party, drunk as hell, begging for a ride home. He picked her up, tucked her into bed with a bucket and a bunch of water, and didn\u2019t say a word about her behavior. Then, he got up at 6am and made the biggest, smelliest, loudest breakfast he could. He went about his day completely ignoring her raging hangover, being excruciatingly chipper, just letting her experience the full repercussions of her actions. The woman is almost 40 now, and still rarely drinks.", "It\u2019s not excuses peer pressure is very common amongst kids", "I don\u2019t really see that as making excuses. It\u2019s very common for teens to be influenced by what their peers are doing.", "Then you have an issue of the police possibly coming at the kid for underage drinking which can cause a whole new host of problems. I'd be careful going to the cops. Seeing as his mother has no issues with child neglect I fear what she may say to the cops in that situation.", "> *Nta thats dangerous as hell. Kids have literally been murdered in similiar situations*!\n\nOne of the victims of the Homolka/Bernardo murders in Canada was Leslie Mahaffy, 14 years old, who had been locked out of her home for violating her curfew.\n\nNTA", "I was going to say this too", "This is the first thing I thought of when I read the post.", "I hate to tell you, but \"the wrong person\" could do a lot more damage than calling CPS.", "He knows. When we talked about it I made sure he knew that he was wrong but what happened was not warranted. I don't want him to think that he'll be kicked out every time he messes up.", "I've never heard of that case before that's terrible. I wouldn't be able to live if something like that happened to my son. I'm going to try and get my wife to see how incredibly dangerous what she did was.", "Wow, never heard of that case. Sadder to know her friends parents wouldn\u2019t let her sleep over either. Jesus\u2026", "Was just going to say the same thing. So sad\u2026.", "How is this E S H territory?", "In Canada this happened and the girl was taken, raped and murdered by Paul Bernardo and Karla homalka.  I would never lock my child out.", "Being able to rely on your parents is great for a teenager", "> he will never call her for help for anything if he needs it\n\nBingo.  It was an egregiously stupid and emotional thing she did.", "I was raised with \u201ctough love\u201d. This isn\u2019t it. This is called child neglect.", "It\u2019s not tough love to leave a slightly drunk child outside", "Just had th peer pressure talk with my son. Told him not to fall for it. We'll see if it sticks.", "I\u2019ve never said what she did wrong, I said they don\u2019t know how to punish their kid.", "The part that said \u201cI\u2019m not saying what he did was right, but him and had a talk about and it\u2019s fine.\u201d It sounded like he was okay with the kid drinking.", "How are you frame a problem dictates the types of solutions you can find for it. His son chose to hang out with his friends that were drinking and his son chose to drink with them. Of course a child will spin the situation in whatever way makes them look most innocent.", "Also entirely true. I just went for what the wife would probably be concerned about, since she clearly doesn't give a fuck about the son, but gives a fuck about 'ThE RuLEs!'", "That's really good. Its so important for kids to know that their parents can be trusted even when they mess up. Punishments are supposed to teach accountability, locking him outside isn't going to do that. I don't imagine that settling this with your wife is going to be easy, but as a parent your first priority has to be your son, which you're doing really well at in this situation so far. Good luck!", "I just posted above about Paul Bernardo and his despicable wife.  Do you and your wife want that guilt?", "Good but also there is a possibility if he sees his friends doing that stuff that there is a chance he would want to try it too for example drinking or weed or something. I just want you to know that you can\u2019t really stop it if he sets his mind to it so I suggest you tell him that you do not advice him to do it but if he ever does it and ends up being super drunk or super high he can always call his parents for assistance getting home if he ends up stranded. Atleast that\u2019s what my parents did to me and I haven\u2019t touched a drug :)", "A child is a child and even at 16 lacks the development to make smart decisions under pressure. Hell, even adults with fully developed brains aren\u2019t immune to this. Please stop acting as if peer pressure is not a very really factor in the decisions people, especially teens, make. It\u2019s disingenuous at best.", ">he can always call his parents for assistance getting home if he ends up stranded. \n\nThat's exactly what I told him. I told him if he ever felt unsafe, people were doing drugs, drinking, stealing, or just anything where he didn't feel safe or felt too deep into something, just call me or text me. I will be right there to get him. He won't be in trouble. (At least not in that moment.) He said ok."]}
