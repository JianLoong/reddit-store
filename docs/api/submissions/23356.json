It is very possible that you could have come back and not have had a son anymore come morning. He could have ended up dead. I suggest you drill that into her head her immature and frankly childish behavior put her son at risk Who is himself a child and not capable of making mature decisions. That's why he's a kid. She's the adult and should be able to recognize that. I also think she really needs to go to counseling because that is not the correct way to handle that situation at all.

I too would be furious if my SO had done this to our child. Locking him out over night isn't going to teach him a lesson, it's just going to show him that he can't rely on mom when he makes bad choices. Teens experiment, it's part of life and growing up.

That means she would do that again. You need to put a hard stop to that.\n\nMy inclination would be to suggest making a police report and having them come over and let your wife know what would happen to her if she tried that again. The problem with that approach is that once you start the ball rolling, you never know where it will stop. You want her to take it seriously, but you don't want her actually arrested and potentially prosecuted for that first offense.\n\nETA:\n\nA different idea.

Seems unlikely to me.\n\nIrrelevant to the whole thing, but for the record, drinking laws in the US are asinine and people who freak out about underage drinking are typically either extremely obedient to the law(gross) or have intense religious reasons to oppose drinking(also gross imo). There are cultures and countries around the world where 16 year olds have a beer with their friends without the sky falling. Learning to drink responsibly at a gradual pace seems much healthier to me than zero tolerance until 21, at which point WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO I CAN DOWN THIS WHOLE MAG OF JACK MYSELF, I'M INVINCIBLE WOOOOOOOO TIME TO DRIVE HOME I DON'T EVEN FEEL IT WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.\n\nJust my two cents.", "Question: Does he do this often or was it his first time?

Everyone was there from the night before and miserable.\nThe only thing my grandfather said when he came back was \u201cdrink more water, booze dehydrates you\u201d. \nThat was it and he never did it again.\nHis HS friends still tell me that story like every year", "This was my mother-in-law\u2019s tactic for my husband haha", "I always had to do farm chores growing up.  Mix that with a hangover and i did not want to drink anymore lol.  \n\nNothing is quite like getting kicked, falling into the gutter, and being covered in shit while your hungover / half drunk yet.  \n\nBut it did seem like most of the cows knew i didn\u2019t feel good so they were usually chill.  There was always one or two that were sassy though.  \n\nThe one thing i learned is to never change the radio station when milking them.  Mom had country music on all the time and the cows seemed to like it.  Every single time i changed it to anything but country, they wanted to riot.  \n\nOnce i learned that, milking was never an issue beyond waking up early for me.", "I hope her family sued them!", "See my comment above, with links to a documentary about this.  Not just volunteering with children.  She had a business selling infant clothes, she worked as a nanny (the poor mother said Karla was a big fan of novels about serial killers and graphic violence), and worked as an english tutor to minor children - where she almost bankrupted a woman's business.  All of this was in Guadeloupe, where the authorities had zero idea who was in their country until the French journalist showed up asking questions.  No-one in authority in Canada bothered to inform them about any of it.", "He should know who he married. He\u2019s the sibling of Karla\u2019s lawyer, after all. Wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear later that she horrifically abused her daughters.", "If the Canadian system is anything like the American system, the judge could have invalidated the deal assuming they found out before she pled.  If that\u2019s the case and they didn\u2019t invalidate, it\u2019s fucking disgusting.", "I agree that\u2019s why it\u2019s called the deal with the devil. To me it\u2019s very shameful piece of our criminal history.", "THIS is the way to deal with it. Drinking is an adult activity. Adults also have to work. Time for some chores I'd say.\n\nAlso British here. I was allowed a drink from 12 ish (a very weak shandy or wine spritz for special occasions). When I left school at 16 I was told I will be treated like an adult, assuming I act like one. Adults are allowed to drink, have a full time job or part time/education and therefore pay for their own alcohol and behave respectfully when drinking. Behave like and adult and be treated like one, or return to being treated like a child until you can afford to move out. If we were ever caught drinking outside the home or other sanctioned occasions we'd not touch a drop until we were 18. \n\nBoth me and my brother had a slip or or two at family parties and we're swiftly sent  to apologise to the host the next morning. The shame/urgent morning after chores was the best lesson!", "Yes it\u2019s fucked. I know what NOT to do, completely opposite of my parents\u2026 but what\u2019s that? Reparenting is doubly hard.", "My older brother got caught at 6am at his buddies house. Mom woke up with a suspicion, drove to friends house and dragged him out of the house by his ear and then he was set to mow the lawn and pull weeds as soon as they got home.", "When my dad caught me, he got me up for the early Mass. I had to sit through the entire thing with the worst hangover I\u2019ve ever had. Definitely learned my lesson!", "I had to wash a gross deep freeze in the heat", "My husband made our son mow the lawn in 80 degree heat", "Had to clean out the barn with the boys", "All you had to do was wash the car? Damn, your parents were nice.", "Hoeing the garden in the 90 degree heat for me. Ugghhhhh.", "the way you worded this makes it sound like it happened multiple times, I feel like once would make me never want to come home drunk again?\n\nbut that\u2019s my fully established prefrontal cortex talking, tbd on what my teenage self would have thought about this (spoiler: probably would have thought \u201cwhat are the odds I get caught again, and what are the odds I have to do this same thing again\u201d)", "Your grandpa must have been in the military because when my great grandfather stayed out 48hrs on a 24hr pass his punishment was to dig a 10ft ditch that they made him fill right back up after he was done", "That\u2019s hard enough to deal with sober, I can\u2019t even imagine it with a hangover!", "She also learned french to move to Quebec where they didn't care when she had her children, and changed her name to Karla Teale", "Good on that French journalist blowing her cover up", "Good she gets driven out everytime. I would not want a homicidal maniac like her in my community either. But I pity the children she has that have the misfortune to be born to a mum like her", "Dear Lord. I couldn't imagine willingly marrying someone when you know they've committed crimes like that. \n\nI really hope by some miracle of God that her kids aren't horrifically abused.", "I could be wrong but I believe she pled first and it was accepted, then they found the video tapes.", "Your mom is a beast", ">drove to friends house and dragged him out of the house by his ear\n\nCoulda just pinned him  here but she decided to start climbing the turnstile up to the third rope for the elbow drop!", "Nope, def was grounded for a long time and lost other privileges but this was the first and most jarring of their punishments as I was still 20% vodka at the time.", "otoh, if it happened multiple times it wasn't a very effective punishment, as far as behavior modification.", "My father made my brother and I move a stack of split wood to a new location and back when we wouldn\u2019t stop arguing.", "....I'm disturbed by that recipe for sauerkraut.  All it needs is salt and raw cabbage and time.", "Creative and evidently effective punishments. Add these punishments to a hangover, and I'd have never done it again. Of course, I was so scared of everything, I never drank until I was 26.", "Basically, Canada doesn\u2019t have the fifth amendment, it\u2019s a very different process.\n\nThe crown wanted her as a witness against Bernardo. And the way it works in Canada is that the crown tells you how much they believe they can can convict you for all your crimes and offer you a deal. How much jail time, how much money they put in your commissary, other special considerations, basically whatever they want.\n\nYou can refuse the deal, and then they will go to trial against you. Or you can take the deal and become a witness for the crown. If you do, you then do a full confession and everything in that confession is free from prosecution forever, it\u2019s included in the jail time they negotiated earlier.\n\nLet just say that the crown thought she did very little and she confessed to a *lot*. And according to Canadian law, there is nothing we can do about it at all. Including preventing her from working with kids. She\u2019d need to commit a new crime or we\u2019d need to find one she didn\u2019t confess to.", "Oh wait! Just read that she now goes by Emily Tremblay and lives in Quebec City!", "I\u2019ll tell her you said that \ud83d\ude0e", "Unfortunately it wasn\u2019t the first or the last time for this kind of thing, she had to get creative!", "Alright then, carry on.", "damn someone should tell camp greenlake that digging holes might not deter bad behavior", "Mom had a few oddball recipes, she taught me to make guacamole using miracle whip and an avocado. Which I didn't realize until I was in my mid thirties that that is not the correct way to make guacamole."]}
