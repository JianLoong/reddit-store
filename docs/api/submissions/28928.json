The house had been in the family since it was built in 1939. \n\nMy aunt had taken care of my grandparents late in life, and they had left the house to her because (a) my uncle had taken his part of his inheritance when he was younger and (b) my father was in a more stable financial position at the time and was willing to cede his portion of the inheritance. One of my cousins briefly lived at the home with his wife, but they ultimately moved out. \n\nYears later, I was looking for a house with my ex,  and had enquired about the house. My aunt was willing to sell the house to me for $73k (2/3rds of the fair market value at the time) because my aunt was more stable and felt obligated to my father to cover for his 1/3 of the inheritance from the house to help make the house more affordable for me at the time, as I was having a difficult time financially. \n\nEventually my ex and I split up and I paid her back the portion of the down payment she\u2019d contributed. I eventually got accepted to grad school, started dating another woman, graduated, ended up got married and started working. \n\nMy wife and I have put a lot of work into the house, and had intended on staying with numerous renovations, but after having spent over $15k on plans and a land survey and getting nothing but quotes north of $400k, my wife and I started looking and the right home became available. \n\nI discussed the matter with my cousin, who recognized the awkwardness of the situation with my aunt. He suggested giving her the option of purchasing the house, which I thought was reasonable. \n\nThe following morning, I got an angry message on Instagram from my cousin\u2019s wife accusing me of stealing my cousins\u2019 inheritance, asking what I did to deserve getting the house for such a reduced price, and taking advantage of my aunt\u2019s guilt over receiving the entire inheritance to turn the house for a profit. She effectively said no one in the family trusts me anymore and called my wife a gold digger. \n\nThe short of it was that we weren\u2019t yet even sure how to broach the topic with my aunt, let alone the ethical ramifications of selling a family house that was sold at a discount \u2014 it hadn\u2019t crossed my mind that the right thing to do might be to gauge my family\u2019s interest in re-acquiring the house.\n\nI did eventually speak with my aunt regarding the house and offered to sell it back to her for the sale value of $73k (well below the current market value), and responded that she had no interest. She also stated unprompted that she had sold the house to me at that price due to the arrangement with my father as a favor. \n\nI even went out of my way to call my cousins individually to offer them the house for the previous sale price of $73k.

Just ignore them NTA", "I don't think you're an AH for not offering it to family first. In your shoes, I suspect that I would have started by checking to see if any relatives wanted it (though because it's been in the family for so long, rather than any other reason). It would have been a nice thing for you to do, but it's hardly a requirement. \n\nYes, absolutely, offering to sell it to family for what you paid for it *more than* makes up for any (debatable) errors you made by not offering it to family first. \n\nYou definitely should *not* donate the profits; there is no reason to do that.", "If it needs to be sold as price you inquired, then your aunt needed to give that house to you or cousins for free. Because that's what she paid. Don't listen to the cousin's crazy wife. She is telling you because your cousin is on your side and she wants free money. \n\nYou probably know, but does she know how much it cost to keep a house built in 1939's liveable? I think it's cheaper to take that house down and build a new one on top of it! We lived in the house built in 1964 and it was nightmares.", "If the house sells at a loss taking into account the money spent since you bought it, Would the cousins wife give you the difference ,Dont think so ,so why should you give them any of the profit, Where does she get it was his inheritance as you legally own the house , and taken inflation into account I bet 73.000 is a lot more today, Give them nothing ,", "NTA and there is no need to offer it to anyone in the family for less then current market value after the improvements and renovations you have made. \n\nYour aunt sold it to you at 2/3 price because she was making right taking her brothers share of the inheritance years prior. That implies she got 2/3 of market price at that time. Y'all are square.\n\nPeople are greedy and jealous that doesn't make them right.", "NTA though your cousin's wife is.  It's none of her business what happened to that house, it was your aunt's who decided to sell it to you.  You can do what you want with it since your aunt doesn't care to own it again.  Don't feel guilty and don't give them the profit.  Your cousin's wife is greedy.", "NTA. As far as I can tell your first thought was to offer first refusal to your aunt, the rest of them really have no say in this. Your aunt did you a favour when you bought it, your cousin didn't and certainly your cousin's wife didn't. I wouldn't have offered it at the original price either. Once a house is bought out, it's bought out. \n\nGaslighting you that no one trusts you because you stole something you didn't, objecting to you selling it rather than giving it to her, projecting her own gold diggery. She's gotta be republican.", "NTA.  No need to split or give away the profits from an asset you've been paying for (mortgage, renovations, taxes).  You should have told the cousin's wife that she was overstepping and the conversation didn't include her.  Then refused to engage with her further about this.  She's simply greedy.", "NTA and you don't have to offer it below market price. Your aunt had an arrangement with your father that resulted in a discount for you. She effectively owed your father and wanted to pay it back by helping you. Unless you owe any of your extended family something of equal value, you aren't morally required to give them a discount. Your cousin's wife seems entitled and her comments were certainly inappropriate.", "Cousin's wife is definitely the asshole. I think OP should talk to the cousin about that.\n\nOP, you were just beginning to think about selling. It sounds like your aunt had tried to give you a fair price when she sold it to you. I don't see any reason to immediately think of selling it back to her. Your cousin made a suggestion, you agreed and followed it. You are not an asshole for not having thought of family before talking to your cousin.\n\nTo reiterate, your cousin's wife is a flaming asshole who needs to keep her nose in her own shit.", "No you put time and work in to that houses so you should keep the profit. If you want you can do something nice to aunt for letting you buy it at a discount. You are welcome to see if anyone in the family wants it. If not sell it. Yes it would be great to keep in family however its not on you to keep it in the family.", "It really wasn't sold at a discount. Aunt 2/3rds, father 1/3 of the house, he just forgives it rather than asking to be bought out or selling the house and splitting it. Aunt recognised that when she sold it and wanted to pay back the 1/3rd your father should have got. once you bought out her 2/3rds her share is fully paid off and the extra 1/3rd is basically inherited from your dad.\n\ncousin's wife is a gold digger, ignore her.", "NTA.  The sale was between you and your aunt.  It's your house and nobody else's business.  All the profits are yours.  You should have no guilt in this matter."]}
