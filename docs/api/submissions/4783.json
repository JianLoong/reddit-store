Shouting at people is absolutely not a reasonable way to express displeasure or upset. And when one borrows something, returning it is on the borrower, not the lender. You both handled this situation wrong.", "ESH, but leaning more towards YTA - She should have returned it without being asked to, but you don\u2019t need to shout about it and make a mountain out of a molehill. Is this really a way to speak your SO? I\u2019d be forgetful if I was living in a state of hypervigilance which is often how women exist day to day when living with partners who shout at them. Most phones have a digital wallet for the worst case scenario, it\u2019s really not worth berating your partner over.", "ESH.

Grow up, both of you.", "If you actually shouted over a one time event, ESH. Everyone knows if you borrow something, you should put it back where you found it. Her argument is just absurd. Shouting at her was way over the top though.", "ESH. In most circumstances I don\u2019t think shouting is helpful especially over something that in all honesty wasn\u2019t a big deal imo. But your wife should have taken accountability for not putting it back instead of blaming you bc again this is kind of a small issue and being like \u201cI\u2019m sorry I completely forgot\u201d shouldn\u2019t be hard to do imo", "ESH - lack of personal responsibility (wife) and gross overreaction (you)\n\nI mean, there isn\u2019t much more to it than that.", "ESH.

I put it in my wallet and forgot to give it back when we got back to the room. Later in the day he asked for it back. I said sure and got it out of my wallet and handed it to him.

It\u2019s ok to be frustrated but it wasn\u2019t an issue. Just communicate with her and ask her to return it when she\u2019s done next time because you might\u2019ve needed it. She should\u2019ve returned it when she was done and her argument is strange. Very few people check the contents of their wallet before leaving the house.

Really? YTA for shouting at your wife over something so minor. She's also TA for not returning it, and for trying to put the responsibility for getting it back onto you. But seriously, dude.... learn to have minor disagreements without shouting. And this incident doesn't even really qualify as a disagreement. Just ask for it back, and tell her that when she borrows it should return it to you on her own.

Yes, your wife should have remembered to give it back, and no it\u2019s not your responsibility to ask for a borrowed possession to be returned - but that\u2019s petty nonsense.  You screaming at your wife is not - that\u2019s 100% unacceptable, abusive behavior.

She didn't burn down the house.\nIt's just an effing card.

If I lose it or he's in a position that he can't buy something he needs, that's on ME. He's not a yeller.
