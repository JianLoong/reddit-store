She could have just forgotten - there was no reason to shout at her for that. However, her telling you it was your responsibility to check/ask for it is an AH statement.", "ESH. Shouting at people is absolutely not a reasonable way to express displeasure or upset. And when one borrows something, returning it is on the borrower, not the lender. You both handled this situation wrong.", "ESH, but leaning more towards YTA - She should have returned it without being asked to, but you don\u2019t need to shout about it and make a mountain out of a molehill. Is this really a way to speak your SO? I\u2019d be forgetful if I was living in a state of hypervigilance which is often how women exist day to day when living with partners who shout at them. Most phones have a digital wallet for the worst case scenario, it\u2019s really not worth berating your partner over.", "ESH. Your wife for making you ask as though it were responsibility, and you for escalating when all you had to do was ask.", "ESH\n\nCorrected course of events: \n\nOP: hey babe, did i get my card back? \n\nWIFE: oh darn i forgot, it's in my jacket. Do we need to go get it?\n\nOP: nah, we're good. \n\nWIFE: ok let's try to remember when we get home. \n\nOP: cool.\n\n\nWhat a stupid ass argument to have. \nGrow up, both of you.", "If you actually shouted over a one time event, ESH. Everyone knows if you borrow something, you should put it back where you found it. Her argument is just absurd. Shouting at her was way over the top though.", "ESH. In most circumstances I don\u2019t think shouting is helpful especially over something that in all honesty wasn\u2019t a big deal imo. But your wife should have taken accountability for not putting it back instead of blaming you bc again this is kind of a small issue and being like \u201cI\u2019m sorry I completely forgot\u201d shouldn\u2019t be hard to do imo", "ESH - lack of personal responsibility (wife) and gross overreaction (you)\n\nI mean, there isn\u2019t much more to it than that.", "ESH.

YTA alright.\n\n(Yes, wife was wrong for not returning the bank card but if someone came at me \u201cshouting\u201d over this I\u2019d have a hard time finding an apology to give them.)", "ESH. It's common decency to return stuff you borrowed. Shouting at her for that is not ok.", "I believe that ESH.\n\nI am surprised that some people are making OP to be the only A-hole here seeing as wife is the one blaming him for her not returning his bank card.\n\n\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "The other weekend my family was staying at a hotel. My son needed breakfast and there was a restaurant in the lobby so I said I\u2019d take him down to buy him breakfast. My husband gave me his credit card because the got x5 the points on that card. I put it in my wallet and forgot to give it back when we got back to the room. Later in the day he asked for it back. I said sure and got it out of my wallet and handed it to him. No yelling, no blame, no issues. Why would you yell over such a non issue.? YTA", "NTA\n\nDid she take the card without your knowledge or not. \n\nEither way if she has taken it than she has to put it back. Its not up to you to chase. \n\nNext time tell her she can pay for all the expenses!", "Nta. If you borrow something it is your responsibility to return it. If you have to be asked to return it - you screwed up.", "I\u2019d say ESH. You shouldn\u2019t have instantly yelled at her and lost your temper. It\u2019s ok to be frustrated but it wasn\u2019t an issue. Just communicate with her and ask her to return it when she\u2019s done next time because you might\u2019ve needed it. She should\u2019ve returned it when she was done and her argument is strange. Very few people check the contents of their wallet before leaving the house. She is an adult and has the ability to return things to where she found them. Neither one of you did the right thing here.", "ESH YTA for yelling and expecting her to put the card in your wallet.  She\u2019s TA for not handing the card back and expecting you to ask for it back.", "ESH you shouldn\u2019t have yelled at her and she should have taken initiative and put it back", "ESH.\n\nYou literally *shouted* at her over that? Really? YTA for shouting at your wife over something so minor. She's also TA for not returning it, and for trying to put the responsibility for getting it back onto you. But seriously, dude.... learn to have minor disagreements without shouting. And this incident doesn't even really qualify as a disagreement. Just ask for it back, and tell her that when she borrows it should return it to you on her own. Why does she not have her own card?", "ESH. you for yelling at her and her for not returning the card.", "ESH for shouting at your wife about such a trivial thing", "YTA.  Yes, your wife should have remembered to give it back, and no it\u2019s not your responsibility to ask for a borrowed possession to be returned - but that\u2019s petty nonsense.  You screaming at your wife is not - that\u2019s 100% unacceptable, abusive behavior.  You had a right to be angry, but you also had a responsibility to control your temper no matter how frustrated you felt.  \u201cBlowing up\u201d over everyday arguments is not normal and not okay.", "got very angry very quickly and started shouting almost screaming at my wife\n\nYTA.     She didn't burn down the house.\nIt's just an effing card.   Don't  you have a credit card to use?\n\nYes, she should  have given it back after she used it, but your response  to shout and scream at her is ridiculous", "YTA sounds like you started shouting at her and then her defence was that you should have asked for it.", "YTA for shouting yes.", "YTA for yelling at your wife.", "YTA for shouting at her. You were fine for the situation of needing money, all you had to do was politely ask if she still had it, and remind her to give it back. \n\nSounds like if she has to borrow your bank card and you're shouting for it to be returned, you're very controlling!", "Nta,\nOne can reasonably assume a card is still in their wallet if not told otherwise.  It seems like you weren't mad she used it, just that she didn't put it back.", "NTA.\n\nShe took your card without asking and was expecting you to ask for it back?
