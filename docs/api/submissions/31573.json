My husbands family all know this however, last Christmas (24th) we went to visit his family (siblings, nephews, parents, partners) and his brother comments on how his wife and one of his sons had only just got over being sick 3 days ago and that he also is feeling unwell. They only told us after we had been at the dinner table sitting and eating next to them for atleast an hour and they alreadymade their children hug everyone when they got there to greet everyone. Not much we could do so we just got on with the day.\n\n2 days later I get the sickness bug, the same sickness bug that my husband's brother, his wife and son had only a few days before seeing us. I was so sick and my chronic illnesses were heavily impacted. I kept passing out because my blood pressure kept dropping, I had the worst pain ever in my life to the point I was crying and writhing in pain not knowing what to do, my husband even had to take time off work to care for me and he almost took me to hospital were it not for the UK health system being so under pressure that our local hospital were telling people not to go there. \n\nWe find out a few days after that my husbands dad and sister also got the same sickness bug. My husband was absolutely furious to say the least that his brother and family turned up to a family gathering only 3 days after being so ill where there was me, immune compromised and my husbands father who is vulnerable due to his age. \n\nHad they warned us ahead of time then I could have stayed home to avoid getting sick, but honestly I think they shouldn't have turned up considering they got 3 people sick and were still in the contagious period!\n\nAnyway that leads me to this year, we are due to visit his family again for Christmas and my husband suggested I if not both of us not go just in case his brothers family do the same. They have 2 boys that go to school which is a breeding ground for viruses, they always have a cold and I'm inclined to follow his advice. I absolutely cannot get sick again and they all know this. But I can't help feeling like a massive asshole for not going. We've asked his brother to warn us ahead of time if they're sick but he never does and this has happened before but I was never so seriously ill as I was last year. \n\nSo I just want to know, AITA for not wanting to visit family this year after what happened last year?", "created_utc": 1700746777, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1821ep5/aita_for_not_wanting_to_visit_family_this/", "score": 37, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

No need to go into details.\n\nYou know the risks. They don't really know and will likely think lightly just like they did last time even if you tell them again. You will be the one to pay the price and they won't even see the results of their carelessness, so once again it won't weigh on them. You have to make the judgment here. There's nothing to feel guilty about.", "NTA\n\nMy best friend is immuno-compromised, and I ***always*** cancel plans with her if I'm feeling the least bit unwell, or have been with friends, family or co-worker who have then gotten ill. \n\nAs a matter of fact, everyone at the office, all my friends and family know that she's immuno-compromised, so they all make an effort to remember to contact me, if they've gotten ill after they've seen me. It's not a perfect system, but we all try our best to protect her, so she can have a decent social life.", "Come on! \"Once bitten, twice shy\".\n\nYou don't want to go and take the risk again. The only other person who matters in this situation, your husband, agrees with you and if fact suggested that both of you stay home.\n\nYou're NTA and I don't see how you could think otherwise.", "NTA. Skip it. You can video call in if they really want to see you.", "NTA. Stay home. Stay healthy!", "Let me just go ahead and ask, is visiting with family more important than your life?  If you are compromised then they should be more respectful and considerate.  Since they are not and this is not a one time thing, then you would be totally right in not going around people that actually put your survival in jeopardy.  Again, is seeing them worth your life?", "NTA. I\u2019m immune compromised. Something that most people can get over might kill me.\nShowing up with an illness around someone who is immune compromised is essentially them playing a game of Russian roulette with your life. Personally, I would never visit them again. They obviously have no qualms over potentially killing you.", "NTA.\n\nI live with an immunocompromised person, and if I catch even the slightest of colds, he is in such a bad shape he needs multiple medications, weeks in bed and sometimes visits to the hospital. \n\nThis was extremely insensitive and dangerous. Chronic illness is never 1+1=2. You can never know how your body will react to a disease. \n\nI'd say if you really want to risk it, go with a mask (you and your husband), and spend the least amount of time in there. Only remove the mask for eating (and even for that, stay far away from everyone). But if I were you, I'd stay at home and maybe have a bit of a virtual meeting?", "NTA. You are probably just not going to be able to visit during the holidays anymore. \u2018Tis the season for viruses. Plus when you add in busy airports, etc it is bound to happen. Schedule a visit in the spring or autumn when viruses are taking a hiatus. Have an outdoor picnic so you ah e a fighting chance of staying healthy.", "NTA. It was completely inconsiderate and irresponsible for them to not mention beforehand that they had been sick/are sick. Don't go unless you can make sure no one gets sick beforehand. Which is probably impossible but still.", "There\u2019s really no conflict here because your husband agrees. Stay home & stay healthy.\n\nNAH \u2014 no one\u2019s fault that kids get sick. Unless brother is a pediatrician I can\u2019t imagine why anyone would feel there was any ill intent to get anyone else sick. \n\nedit", "NTA", "NTA if you don't want to go, completely up to you. But I wouldn't necessarily blame the family as they were probably out of the period of time when doctors considered them \"contagious\", they likely didn't infect you on purpose. I'm assuming if they were 3 days out they were probably following the recommendations from their doctor. \n\nI have POTS and several other cardiac issues. I pass out every time I get ill and many times end up in the hospital needing IV fluids. It's unfortunate, but I choose to continue going to functions and being social. I figure I'm just as likely to get sick from someone at work, the store, the gym, or just being out around people as I am at a holiday get together. It's a risk I'm willing to take. You just have to figure out what works best for you and what you are comfortable with.", " NAH - do what you think is best for your own health \n\nBut \u2026 people get sick all the time, especially this time of year. They didnt show up with active infections. Your health is your responsibility and I think youre putting too much blame on your family.

OP has to protect herself and it could be avoided to a certain extent if the family would be honest about their health.\n\nI know people complain about the US health care system but I have never had a problem like OP described.  I\u2019ve seen horror stories about the NHS being so overwhelmed people are waiting 10 hours in an ambulance waiting to actually get in the ER.", "I get it - schools are a petrie dish. But I think there seems to be some sort of blame placed on the parents and/or kids for simply, being in a school.", "It is awful here. My husbands grandfather who is 95 had a fall a few weeks ago and knocked himself out. His wife was told an ambulance wait would be 5 hours. She decided to take him to hospital herself and they found a brain bleed so the 5 hour ambulance wait would have killed him. People are actually dying waiting for ambulances, people having heart attacks dying alone waiting for help and some ambulances are waiting with patients outside hospitals to be seen for upto 24 hours! Appointments are very hard to get too. I've been waiting to see a cardiologist about a heart problem for over a year. People are dying waiting for cancer treatment and like I said, hospitals are telling people not to turn up at A&E (The ER).", "I didn't read it as blame, but as recognition of a realistic risk that had to be taken into consideration. The probability of one of them being sick is high. The blame is focused on the in-laws who can't be relied on to give any warnings or to stay away if they are sick."]}
