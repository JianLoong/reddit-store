If you won't ever give it to her, she's forced to barge in and take it. Why not use the lure of your attention to incentivise her to change since you are stuck in this situation until you can move out?\n\nOnly watching you play gets boring, but she still wants to hang. This, in my experience, leads to the whining and negative behavior. Instead. Sometimes. Hand her the controller and make her put her money where her mouth is. Or pull up a two player game and practice the fun kind of sh*t talking each other. Winner is the one who gets the other person to mess up because they are laughing too hard.\n\nInitiate a weekly \"her thing\" uncritical hour where you will do one of her favorite activities, but she can't criticize you for anything or it's over for that week. Take that time to also ask for her opinion or advice so she can see the difference between unwanted and wanted help. Challenge her to a contest to craft the ugliest thing possible. Perfection is the enemy.\n\nHeck, even a little rubber band on her wrist that she can twang as a reminder to not give unhelpful commentary might help if she's willing. Consider making it a condition of that direct interaction time. She can have you in the most boring and unwilling way possible or she can have fun and work on being less irritating.\n\nI know my advise isn't as fun as criticizing her back until she's upset, but you know you'll only get in trouble for that.

I agree with others that she needs more guidance from your parents and / or therapy to find new ways to relate to people.

In people like that, negative attention is better than no attention. If they can't get positive attention, then they'll settle for negative.\n\nBased on what she's saying, I don't believe for an instant that she desires to help. \"You're so bad at this game, you should quit.\"\n\nNo one on earth would say that out of a desire to be helpful. She knows what annoys you, and she knows how to manipulate your parents into taking her side. Your sister is far more devious than you give her credit for.\n\nYou could try playing the game with headphones.
