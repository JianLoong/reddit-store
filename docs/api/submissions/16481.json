{"id": 16481, "submission_id": "1390tip", "title": "AITA for rescinding my promise to pay for my nephew's birthday present?", "selftext": "My (44F) nephew (15M) is super into comic books, anime, all that kind of thing. It's not his parents' thing, so he hasn't been able to go to any conventions for it, and really, really wanted to go to one for his upcoming 16th birthday. There's a smaller, reasonably priced comic convention in our city this summer, so I promised to take him as a late birthday gift. My wife and I bought weekend passes for ourselves, him and our daughter (19), who is autistic.\n\nOur daughter is a very talented seamstress. We explained to her what the convention would be like, and she was clear that she wanted to go, provided she could wear noise-cancelling headphones and go back to our hotel room at any time. She wanted to wear matching costumes with her cousin; he loves the Dark Knight trilogy, so he told her he would be Batman and she could pick whatever character she wanted. She chose Scarecrow so the mask would cover her headphones (she doesn't like people giving her odd looks for wearing them).\n\nSo she threw herself into making the costume. She sewed a fitted suit, a straitjacket, and spent almost a week constructing a mask that wouldn't cause sensory issues (she lined the inside with a softer material, it was very clever). When my nephew came over last weekend to visit, she showed him the costume, she was very proud.\n\nI thought he'd be happy she was so into it, but he got very, very annoyed and became really nasty. He told her she hadn't even seen the movies or read the comics, said her costume was terrible, and called her some very hurtful things. It was all very sudden; she couldn't understand why he'd suddenly flipped like that and had a meltdown. She was so upset she tried to throw the costume away, but my wife stopped her and put it in our closet.\n\nI told him that I'm not taking him to the convention after what he said, and his mother (my sister) is furious with me. She says I'm going back on my promise because he made a few rude comments. He did apologize, but I didn't like the excuse he gave; he said the \"way she was talking\" made him suddenly realize \"how hard it would be to have her around\". I told him my mind was made up and he wasn't coming. Now some of my friends are saying I'm being unfair for breaking my promise. AITA?\n\nEdit: To clarify, my daughter has a mild intellectual disability and is semi-verbal. She was not intentionally trying to show off, she was trying to bond with him.

But this seems a bit strange, has something else maybe happened that he\u2019s not letting on about? It\u2019s no excuse for his behaviour of course, but it just seems an extreme reaction. Is a sudden outburst over something like a costume typical of his character?", "NTA, I think nephew was jealous that your daughter would have a better costume.", "NTA so in other words, he is embarrassed of his cousin? All the more reason for your sister to fuck off and teach her son how to act smfh", "NTA: he forfeited his present by acting like a gatekeeper instead of a fan--because fans LIKE IT when somebody else enjoys the thing they're into.", "NTA. You were being generous to him and he was a complete jerk. FAFO", "NTA, \"A few rude comments\"???  Seriously?  I as a parent would not have let him go for that.  Sister and nephew are BOTH out of line!\n\nGood for you and stick to your word, he does not deserve to go and your daughter did not deserve to be treated like that.  I am sure he would have made her miserable.", "NTA. He's old enough to know how to behave and the proper way to treat his cousin. He has to learn that he can't just have a free pass to be a dick in life. It's unfortunate you have to teach him, but I'm glad someone is!", "NTA.  The boy needs this life lesson.

Did he actually think you'd put up with that BS?!? WTF is wrong with your sister, here? She thinks a forced apology is going to undo the hurt her obnoxious son inflicted on his cousin?! She needs a reality check. She should have grounded him for the weekend.", "NTA. If you want to meet half-way with his parent in order to maintain some peace in the family, perhaps consider paying for it (I personally would not) , but do not take him with your family. Being that the way your daughter talks bothers him, he shouldn't have a problem with that. If his parents won't take him, then that's on them and their son- them for not giving him any real consequence for his rude and hurtful behavior and him for being so inconsiderate of someone else's feelings.\n\nEdited to remove 'as that was the gift promised' which I had originally posted directly after ...'consider paying for it...'", "You are NTA.\nI may have a few ideas as to what made him act that way. Cosplay snobbery is very much a thing. If he showed up in a store bought costume next to her handmade one, trust me people would have commented on it. Maybe he wanted to be the one to \"stand out\". \nBut it also could be that he got offended by her dressing up as a character when she is not a fan. Some die hards get supper offended when \" outsiders\" invade their space. Honestly i've been guilty of that myself. Nothing is more annoying then when somebody who has only watched the movies tries to debate you about comic books!\nBut none of that makes what he said ok. Refund his ticket and take your family. Tell your daughter to rock her costume, but please prepare her for a possible run in with the con snobs. Most people are amazing at cons, but there are always a few bad apples.", "Info: is her costume way better than his? Because what he said isn't right, but I can understand being excited to go to your first con only to realize you will be totally upstage by your cousin and constantly being stopped by people wanting to take pictures with her on what is your birthday trip. Nothing like being immediately upstage to make someone lash out.", "Talk to your nephew again.  He apologized and I guess you don\u2019t believe it.  maybe through communication he can experience a teaching moment with understanding and reunite your family.  You did promise, you know. You\u2019re the adult, fix this to heal your daughter and teach your nephew.  Quit acting like a petulant child.", "Nta, however you owe him a different gift. Don't skip the birthday completely, but not spending an entire day together after that disrespect and non-apology is understandable.", "ESH, except your daughter. You rescinded your gift instead of not gifting at all. In bird culture this is considered a dick move", "YTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Your nephew showed his ass with his lack of nuance. He should learn from this.", "Definitely NTA. Kid needs to learn it's not ok to treat people like that. \n\nYour daughter was excited about spending time with her cousin, and she worked really hard to make the costumes. It sounds like she was being really kind and she was looking forward to the event. \n\nNephew was a jerk. Maybe the costumes weren't perfect, but for Pete's sake they were made by a kid, it's impressive she even tried, let alone did as good as you say she did. If he wants a perfect costume he can go buy one. \n\nYour generosity was met with poor behavior and a kid degrading your daughter. Let him sit at home while you are all out having fun and think about what he did wrong and how he will grow from it.", "NTA You take care of your girl. I wish we could ask for the pictures here and you could show her how proud we are of her costume. Perhaps post on made me smile.", "Your nephew and sister are both Assholes.\n\nNot you OP.", "Gatekeeping. She's not a REAL fan, you see. /s", "He can be sullen and moody, but no more than any other teenager. He's always been nice to my daughter, but a little condescending lately. He was not expecting her to put so much work into the costume.", "Oh PLEASE. It\u2019s typical male gatekeeping of the fandom. \nNephew needs to grow up.\nI hope OP will still take the daughter and that they have a blast.\nThen they can show nephew all the cool pictures they took while he stayed at home and reflected on how much of an ass he had been.\n\nNTA.", "He's never been embarrassed of her before, and was initially excited to go with her.", "FAFO?", "He hasn't bought his costume yet. He's just going to buy one from Amazon, so (and I might be biased) I think my daughter's will look better. It's very professional and impressive, it's basically identical to Scarecrow's film costume.", "My daughter is now refusing to sew and saying she's bad at it. Previously, sewing was how we bonded with her; it made her feel good about herself. He seriously damaged her self-esteem. My wife wants to go no-contact with him and his mother. We certainly won't be attending his birthday party or getting him any sort of gift.", "I\u2019m sure he was, but his wording makes me think between her excitement and the costumes, he would be embarrassed. I\u2019m sorry he was so mean to her, it was berserker for her to think of him and try to make him a costume as well.", "Was he embarrassed, or jealous that her costume was better than his? That was my first instinct. Either way, actions and words have consequences and your nephew should learn that sooner than later. NTA.", "Your daughter\u2019s costume sounds amazing. Please tell her that people on the internet are impressed with her skills.", "Eff Around, Find Out", "I do SF conventions and have friends who are master costumers. Please tell your daughter that the entire costume community thinks what she's done is fantastic and she should absolutely go to the con and have a GREAT time! Show that sucker off!! Cosplayers rule!", "Yea, ESH. How he behaved was inappropriate- but he is a kid and the rest of you are adults. Turning his birthday gift into a chance for your daughter to show off is an asshole move.", "Yeah, that makes sense.", "Don't listen to them OP... Your daughter is doing great, keep on encouraging her to do whatever she likes.... maybe talk to your nephew when he's calm but his tantrum has nothing to do with you/your daughter", "Thanks!", "I had no intention of this being a chance for her to \"show off\". He agreed to cosplay with her, and she made a costume. Nothing was stopping him from making his own costume. She was absolutely *not* trying to show him up, she was just excited about her costume. \n\nHe is old enough to know not to call his disabled cousin the r-word, and old enough to accept the consequences of choosing to be ableist. \n\nWhat was she supposed to do, deliberately make a crappy costume so he'd feel better about his?", "How is it now his daughter showing off?  Being talented at something is not an excuse to attack someone, so I really don't understand this take.", "So is he also a skilled tailor? Does he have access to the money to buy the materials nessessary? And why didn't you mention the slur in the original post, huh? Seems like relevant information you would have included before given all the other info you made sure to include.", "It's his birthday trip and he is getting a costume on amazon because that's the resources he has access too. She's coming in with a professional level movie accurate costume that will get everyone's attention and mean they will get constantly stopped so people can gush over it. Do you want to spend your birthday gift standing awkwardly to the side while everyone talks about your cousin?", "Probably not, but it wouldn't have been that hard to say that she did a good job. And if he was so worried about being out costumed, he could have asked her to make his. From what OP says, I'd be willing to bet she would have loved the bonding opportunity.", "Given that I have had to, multiple times, I have to say that nephew/cousin should probably get over himself.  Or maybe ask her to help him with his costume?  There are several many ways to address the costume situation without attacking his cousin.  Her talent at sewing is STILL not an excuse for his behaviour.", "Oh he behaved terribly, thus why my judgement was ESH. But he could be approached with some ammount of empathy after the fact- which OP is totally unwilling to do. He was rude, fuck him, blah blah blah. Especially given be was excited before hand and has never acted this way before- its out of character for him.", "I never said it was, my judgment was ESH. His reaction was innaproprite, but I'm also willing to extend empathy to the 15 year old who is lashing out in a way OP has admitted is out of character for him. He wanted to go have fun at a con with his cousin and aunts and instead was going to have to spend a weekend getting out of the way for pictures. He should not have lashed out like that, but I can have some sympathy for how crushed he would feel.", "My daughter has been extremely distressed since this. As I said in a previous comment, she's now refusing to sew and saying she's bad at it. I'm not sure why I should be empathetic to him when we're still dealing with the fallout from his actions. To you it's a rude comment a teen made; to my daughter, it's a serious insult that she hasn't gotten over.", "So you have sympathy for the neurotypical bully but not my disabled daughter. Fascinating.\n\nEdit: To clarify my feelings, I think it's frankly concerning that you think potentially being overshadowed at a convention is harder than being disabled and having someone tear down the one thing you feel you're good at. He can handle not being the center of attention; she can't handle being verbally abused.", "Somehow, I have difficulty feeling too much sympathy for someone who chooses to bully and hurt someone because they dared to be themselves in front of him.\n\nWhy should she have to make her talents and emotions smaller to make him feel more comfortable? That's complete BS.\n\nHis gift was the visit to the convention. It was never an all day birthday party featuring him as the star.\n\nEdit: typo", "I'm autistic and I can absolutely understand how what he said has crushed her. I hope she can rediscover her joy in sewing and not let cousin's action rob her of her love of it. She's amazing and did nothing wrong.", "I hope she regains her confidence. It sounds like she's great at cosplay.", "Your inability to have empathy for others doesn't mean no one should. Again, funny how how distressed your daughter is didn't make it into the post.", "Again, let me ask you: what is your solution? Do you think my daughter should have deliberately made a bad costume? I thought I made her distress clear in the post. You're accusing me of being unempathetic, but you clearly have no empathy for my disabled daughter.\n\nAnd again, because you haven't answered: what should she have done? If you think she's an asshole for being talented, I don't understand your thought process."]}
