It's not his parents' thing, so he hasn't been able to go to any conventions for it, and really, really wanted to go to one for his upcoming 16th birthday. There's a smaller, reasonably priced comic convention in our city this summer, so I promised to take him as a late birthday gift. My wife and I bought weekend passes for ourselves, him and our daughter (19), who is autistic.\n\nOur daughter is a very talented seamstress. We explained to her what the convention would be like, and she was clear that she wanted to go, provided she could wear noise-cancelling headphones and go back to our hotel room at any time. She wanted to wear matching costumes with her cousin; he loves the Dark Knight trilogy, so he told her he would be Batman and she could pick whatever character she wanted. She chose Scarecrow so the mask would cover her headphones (she doesn't like people giving her odd looks for wearing them).\n\nSo she threw herself into making the costume. She sewed a fitted suit, a straitjacket, and spent almost a week constructing a mask that wouldn't cause sensory issues (she lined the inside with a softer material, it was very clever). When my nephew came over last weekend to visit, she showed him the costume, she was very proud.\n\nI thought he'd be happy she was so into it, but he got very, very annoyed and became really nasty. He told her she hadn't even seen the movies or read the comics, said her costume was terrible, and called her some very hurtful things. It was all very sudden; she couldn't understand why he'd suddenly flipped like that and had a meltdown. She was so upset she tried to throw the costume away, but my wife stopped her and put it in our closet.\n\nI told him that I'm not taking him to the convention after what he said, and his mother (my sister) is furious with me. She says I'm going back on my promise because he made a few rude comments. He did apologize, but I didn't like the excuse he gave; he said the \"way she was talking\" made him suddenly realize \"how hard it would be to have her around\". I told him my mind was made up and he wasn't coming. Now some of my friends are saying I'm being unfair for breaking my promise. AITA?\n\nEdit: To clarify, my daughter has a mild intellectual disability and is semi-verbal. She was not intentionally trying to show off, she was trying to bond with him.

I am sure he would have made her miserable.", "NTA. He's old enough to know how to behave and the proper way to treat his cousin.

If you want to meet half-way with his parent in order to maintain some peace in the family, perhaps consider paying for it (I personally would not) , but do not take him with your family. Being that the way your daughter talks bothers him, he shouldn't have a problem with that. If his parents won't take him, then that's on them and their son- them for not giving him any real consequence for his rude and hurtful behavior and him for being so inconsiderate of someone else's feelings.\n\nEdited to remove 'as that was the gift promised' which I had originally posted directly after ...'consider paying for it...'", "You are NTA.\nI may have a few ideas as to what made him act that way. Cosplay snobbery is very much a thing. If he showed up in a store bought costume next to her handmade one, trust me people would have commented on it. Maybe he wanted to be the one to \"stand out\". \nBut it also could be that he got offended by her dressing up as a character when she is not a fan. Some die hards get supper offended when \" outsiders\" invade their space. Honestly i've been guilty of that myself. Nothing is more annoying then when somebody who has only watched the movies tries to debate you about comic books!\nBut none of that makes what he said ok. Refund his ticket and take your family.

Nothing like being immediately upstage to make someone lash out.", "Talk to your nephew again.  He apologized and I guess you don\u2019t believe it.  maybe through communication he can experience a teaching moment with understanding and reunite your family.  You did promise, you know. You\u2019re the adult, fix this to heal your daughter and teach your nephew.  Quit acting like a petulant child.", "Nta, however you owe him a different gift.

Your nephew showed his ass with his lack of nuance. He should learn from this.", "Definitely NTA. Kid needs to learn it's not ok to treat people like that. \n\nYour daughter was excited about spending time with her cousin, and she worked really hard to make the costumes. It sounds like she was being really kind and she was looking forward to the event. \n\nNephew was a jerk. Maybe the costumes weren't perfect, but for Pete's sake they were made by a kid, it's impressive she even tried, let alone did as good as you say she did. If he wants a perfect costume he can go buy one. \n\nYour generosity was met with poor behavior and a kid degrading your daughter. Let him sit at home while you are all out having fun and think about what he did wrong and how he will grow from it.", "NTA You take care of your girl.

Perhaps post on made me smile.", "Your nephew and sister are both Assholes.\n\nNot you OP.", "Gatekeeping. She's not a REAL fan, you see. /s", "He can be sullen and moody, but no more than any other teenager. He's always been nice to my daughter, but a little condescending lately.

It\u2019s typical male gatekeeping of the fandom. \nNephew needs to grow up.\nI hope OP will still take the daughter and that they have a blast.\nThen they can show nephew all the cool pictures they took while he stayed at home and reflected on how much of an ass he had been.\n\nNTA.", "He's never been embarrassed of her before, and was initially excited to go with her.", "FAFO?", "He hasn't bought his costume yet. He's just going to buy one from Amazon, so (and I might be biased) I think my daughter's will look better. It's very professional and impressive, it's basically identical to Scarecrow's film costume.", "My daughter is now refusing to sew and saying she's bad at it. Previously, sewing was how we bonded with her; it made her feel good about herself. He seriously damaged her self-esteem. My wife wants to go no-contact with him and his mother. We certainly won't be attending his birthday party or getting him any sort of gift.", "I\u2019m sure he was, but his wording makes me think between her excitement and the costumes, he would be embarrassed. I\u2019m sorry he was so mean to her, it was berserker for her to think of him and try to make him a costume as well.", "Was he embarrassed, or jealous that her costume was better than his? That was my first instinct. Either way, actions and words have consequences and your nephew should learn that sooner than later. NTA.", "Your daughter\u2019s costume sounds amazing. Please tell her that people on the internet are impressed with her skills.", "Eff Around, Find Out", "I do SF conventions and have friends who are master costumers. Please tell your daughter that the entire costume community thinks what she's done is fantastic and she should absolutely go to the con and have a GREAT time! Show that sucker off!! Cosplayers rule!", "Yea, ESH. How he behaved was inappropriate- but he is a kid and the rest of you are adults. Turning his birthday gift into a chance for your daughter to show off is an asshole move.", "Yeah, that makes sense.", "Don't listen to them OP... Your daughter is doing great, keep on encouraging her to do whatever she likes.... maybe talk to your nephew when he's calm but his tantrum has nothing to do with you/your daughter", "Thanks!", "I had no intention of this being a chance for her to \"show off\". He agreed to cosplay with her, and she made a costume. Nothing was stopping him from making his own costume. She was absolutely *not* trying to show him up, she was just excited about her costume. \n\nHe is old enough to know not to call his disabled cousin the r-word, and old enough to accept the consequences of choosing to be ableist. \n\nWhat was she supposed to do, deliberately make a crappy costume so he'd feel better about his?", "How is it now his daughter showing off?  Being talented at something is not an excuse to attack someone, so I really don't understand this take.", "So is he also a skilled tailor? Does he have access to the money to buy the materials nessessary? And why didn't you mention the slur in the original post, huh? Seems like relevant information you would have included before given all the other info you made sure to include.", "It's his birthday trip and he is getting a costume on amazon because that's the resources he has access too. She's coming in with a professional level movie accurate costume that will get everyone's attention and mean they will get constantly stopped so people can gush over it. Do you want to spend your birthday gift standing awkwardly to the side while everyone talks about your cousin?", "Probably not, but it wouldn't have been that hard to say that she did a good job. And if he was so worried about being out costumed, he could have asked her to make his. From what OP says, I'd be willing to bet she would have loved the bonding opportunity.", "Given that I have had to, multiple times, I have to say that nephew/cousin should probably get over himself.  Or maybe ask her to help him with his costume?  There are several many ways to address the costume situation without attacking his cousin.  Her talent at sewing is STILL not an excuse for his behaviour.", "Oh he behaved terribly, thus why my judgement was ESH. But he could be approached with some ammount of empathy after the fact- which OP is totally unwilling to do. He was rude, fuck him, blah blah blah. Especially given be was excited before hand and has never acted this way before- its out of character for him.", "I never said it was, my judgment was ESH. His reaction was innaproprite, but I'm also willing to extend empathy to the 15 year old who is lashing out in a way OP has admitted is out of character for him. He wanted to go have fun at a con with his cousin and aunts and instead was going to have to spend a weekend getting out of the way for pictures. He should not have lashed out like that, but I can have some sympathy for how crushed he would feel.", "My daughter has been extremely distressed since this. As I said in a previous comment, she's now refusing to sew and saying she's bad at it. I'm not sure why I should be empathetic to him when we're still dealing with the fallout from his actions. To you it's a rude comment a teen made; to my daughter, it's a serious insult that she hasn't gotten over.", "So you have sympathy for the neurotypical bully but not my disabled daughter. Fascinating.\n\nEdit: To clarify my feelings, I think it's frankly concerning that you think potentially being overshadowed at a convention is harder than being disabled and having someone tear down the one thing you feel you're good at. He can handle not being the center of attention; she can't handle being verbally abused.", "Somehow, I have difficulty feeling too much sympathy for someone who chooses to bully and hurt someone because they dared to be themselves in front of him.\n\nWhy should she have to make her talents and emotions smaller to make him feel more comfortable? That's complete BS.\n\nHis gift was the visit to the convention. It was never an all day birthday party featuring him as the star.\n\nEdit: typo", "I'm autistic and I can absolutely understand how what he said has crushed her. I hope she can rediscover her joy in sewing and not let cousin's action rob her of her love of it. She's amazing and did nothing wrong.", "I hope she regains her confidence. It sounds like she's great at cosplay.", "Your inability to have empathy for others doesn't mean no one should. Again, funny how how distressed your daughter is didn't make it into the post.", "Again, let me ask you: what is your solution? Do you think my daughter should have deliberately made a bad costume? I thought I made her distress clear in the post. You're accusing me of being unempathetic, but you clearly have no empathy for my disabled daughter.\n\nAnd again, because you haven't answered: what should she have done? If you think she's an asshole for being talented, I don't understand your thought process.", "Nta.  Why subject your daughter to him?", "NTA I\u2019m autistic and struggle with rejection sensitivity, when someone you trust does that to you, it is so hard to recover from. Keep supporting her and she will find her way back. \n\nYour nephew is the worst, if he was so worried about his costume, he could have asked her to make his too since it\u2019s her passion. Instead he decided to get mad that she was able to make something amazing despite \u201cnot being a true fan\u201d and verbally attack her. \n\nHe is still a child, so while I have empathy for his distress\u2026 he is old enough to understand that consequences are a direct result of his poor behavior. Keeping your promise at this point will further damage your daughter. \n\nAlso If your daughter is sensitive to touch as well as sound, I would suggest taking a sign or name tag that lets people know that as they approach. People can get super excited at conventions around good costumes, and I don\u2019t want her to get overwhelmed.", "Hell no.  He's too old for that horseshit.  He was deliberately cruel.  Give him a book on kindness, like How Full is Your Bucket.", "NTA, I would cut the kid off. I know this is super harsh, but the comment he made about your daughter being \"hard\" is disgusting and it shows exactly what your nephew thinks of your daughter. Jealousy or not, it's actually not a good idea to have him around your daughter, I'm also ND and comments people have made to me have stuck with me my whole life. I'm heartbroken for your daughter.", "NTA he\u2019s jelly of her amazing talent & upping his costume", "NTA. Your kid is your priority. Do not bank roll anyone who is hurting your kid.", "Nta but I think he might be lashed out because you support your daughter and encourage her hobbies (sewing / cosplay) while your nephew's parents don't bother with his. He is only 15, not the maturest age ever, please talk with him.", "NTA. My heart just crumpled up a little. I\u2019m so sorry your daughter was treated that way. I bet that costume is awesome and I hope you all have a great time at the convention!", "NTA. He's old enough to know better and now he has to face the consequences of his actions.\n\nI really hope your daughter gets over this and back to what she loves!", "Wow. YTA in a big way.", "NTA. It\u2019s not hard to be kind. He learned what happens when you aren\u2019t.", "NTA.  Life lesson for that rotten kid and his mother, too.  Hope he learns it.\n\nI\u2019m sorry he hurt your daughter\u2019s feelings.  I hope she finds someone to spend time with who celebrates her.", "NTA might be a hard lesson for the kid. He probably should learn that being a dick to vulnerable people doesn\u2019t get rewarded. Otherwise that\u2019s the lesson. Tell him that.", "NTA - While you made a promise, his behavior caused you to need to not follow through.\n\nActions have consequences, and no one wants to spend the day hanging out with an AH that makes people feel bad. Especially when it's his cousin who has special needs. Sorry but he deserved to lose this.", "NTAH but your nephew and your sister is.  In what world do they think it is ok to talk like that to anyone, esp someone with disabilities. He is getting what he wants which is not to be around her. The 3 of you still need to go and have a good time. I feel terrible for her", "NTA \n\nAs the parent of a nonverbal ASD child you did exactly the right thing. He needs to learn his words have consequences. \n\nThere will be another convention next year and he can apologize and earn back the chance to go with you. If you take him this year, even with an apology (which at this point would probably be said to get to go) he\u2019s not learning anything. You would be saying that his hurtful and rude words were ok. \n\nYour sister needs to sit him down and explain what he did wrong as well. Her being mad at you for breaking your word and not him for acting atrociously makes me wonder if she\u2019s not saying cruel things behind your back about your child. I could be wrong but if he hasn\u2019t previously acted this way towards her he could be learning it from her\n\nIf your daughter would still like to go, take her and have her proudly show off her costume, she sounds like a great designer. I wonder if she could make a side job of this- creating sensory friendly costumes for little kids with sensory issues would be amazing. Especially since so many little kids love to dress up and it\u2019s so hard to find quality costumes that meet sensory needs", "He was embarrassed by her costume and sensory issues.", "NTA It was \"a few rude comments\". He said awful vile things to hurt someone who is already very vulnerable for no reason except to hurt her. Would she want to take a kid who said what he said?", "NTA, but this will be a permanent divide between your nephew and daughter. Could he make amends by taking an interest in the costume? Maybe he could learn from his behavior if he is kind and not hurtful to your daughter. Fifteen year old boys can be very self- conscious, and he can grow to overcome that. As someone with a disabled sister, I have seen my own nieces and nephews grow in kindness and character through their teen years.", "NTA. It's not okay to verbally abuse your autistic cousin AND still expect her parents to pay for your ticket, drive you to the event, and supervise you. Ridiculous. If someone spoke to my daughter like that, they'd be lucky if I got them a dollar store present.", "NTA!! But I think a costume tax is in order! It sounds amazing!", "NTA- from his explanation, his reaction was because he realized he was embarrassed me in public with her.\n\nMeanwhile, anime conventions and comic conventions are loaded with the neurodiverse.  \n\nIt honestly was one of the first few safe places for those who are different to meet others.\n\nI recommend contacting the convention before it occurs and still taking your daughter.  They often will have quiet rooms where people can decompress if the hotel is too far.", "NTA that was HEINOUS of him. He was jealous of your daughters costume", "100% NTA. He\u2019s old enough to know there are consequences to his actions, and he was *way* out of line. I would not reward his behavior by still bringing him.", "Yup. This is the perfect age for him to learn to zip it unless he has something respectful and productive to say, or there may be consequences.\n\nHis parents can take him if they feel he still deserves it.", "His mom clearly never taught him if he has nothing nice to say it's better to say nothing at all", "That\u2019s how it comes off to me too", "His apology is that OP\u2019s daughter would be \u201ctoo hard to be around\u201d. So now he doesn\u2019t go so he doesn\u2019t have to be around her.", "How?", "Honestly I think he feels intimidated by how good her costume is and feels like his will pale beside hers.\n\nStand your ground. You are NTA and he needs to learn this lesson since his mom won't teach him.", "Ah so he's jealous. He thought he would go with you guys, he would look cool, and she would look home-eccy and crappy. Instead she will be the one impressing people.\n\nOh well. It's a good age to learn that your actions have consequences if you haven't learnt already. And definitely NTA.", "It's also sounds a bit like \"You're not a true fan UNLESS...\" which needs to be nipped in the bud. The gatekeeping is real, especially against women. I hope your daughter still gets to go, it sounds like she put in a lot of work and deserves to enjoy it.", "You weren\u2019t wrong but this is probably his perspective: He\u2019s going to something he always wanted to and now his cousin is making the interest about her. He may be worried that you guys will make him leave if she is overstimulated or if he wants to do something you\u2019d refuse on account of what she\u2019d rather do. Again, you dealt with it fairly but a judgement from internet strangers will help the situation less than understanding would.", "And I'm smelling a bit if \"I'm 16 and therefore cool AF now and I don't want to have my weird cousin around\"", "Aw my heart :(\n\n\nCan you post pictures somewhere and get some kind comments to show your daughter?\n\n\nHis opinion clearly meant a lot to her and to have him be awful in return is just horrible. I'm so sorry", "This was my thought as well, sounds like jealousy", "As a costume maker and nerd who has had way too many dudes threatened by me, this was my exact thought.", "I kind of got the impression too that he was jealous of her costume. The fact that he didn\u2019t get upset until after seeing it, I think maybe he suddenly felt insecure about his own outfit and lashed out. \n\nNTA.", "Yes this was my feeling too, was he expecting one of her creations too", "More \"Your costume is so well done I'm jealous \\*and\\* I'm gatekeeping.\" IMO.", "Oh yes, that's the main dish with a side order of \"What if one of my friends sees me with her?\"", ">I'm not sure why I should be empathetic to him\n\n\nBecause being empathetic to him doesn't  cancel out caring for your daughter? \n\nHe doesn't have the money. He doesn't really have a matching costume if it's not the same quality.  He probably feels like he's there so you can show off your money and your daughters talent at his expense.   Seeing your total unwillingness towards him, I start to wonder if that wouldn't be the case. \n\nDid he react wrong? Yes, sure. But so did you. Now he's a teenager still learning to be an adult. I would expect more from an actual adult . \n\n\nOnce you can extend some kindness to him,   he'll likely feel understood, and change his attitude. Which in turn may help with your daughters feelings. If he apologises and asks for her help, that could be wonderful for both kids .\n\n It is not his normal behaviour. That should tell you something. \n\nAlso being hurt is not a contest. There can be more than one who needs empathy.", "Life lesson for her, too, I guess.", "I love when people suggest girls should be willing punching bags for abusive boys who can't possibly regulate their own emotions or learn the consequences of their actions. What he did is abhorrent, and the consequences you set are appropriate. His mom is doing him a disservice by refusing to parent him. I hope you let your daughter know that she is incredibly talented and so many people on the internet are astounded by the effort she put into her costume. I hope she decides to go to the comic con and has a blast.", "It is his birthday. Would you limit what he does at the convention for her sake?"]}
