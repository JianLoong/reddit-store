Normally, the place closes at 21:30, and it was around 21:40, so we weren't sure if they would still sell us anything. We wanted to ask the staff if it's okay to buy something; we didn't even want to sit. In a polite manner, we asked, 'Good evening, are you still open? Can we order, especially for take away? 'The staff responded, 'Just tell me what do you want? 'We ordered a small cake and an ice cream. As we were about to pay, we double-checked with them if this was okay, as they were looking at us weirdly. The cashier didn't respond and showed the POS to pay. We took our order and sat down. While we were about to eat, I heard one of the staff members, who was leaving their shift (not wearing their uniform), looking at us and muttering about why people keep coming and why they're still sitting to other coworkers. As politely as I could, I told him, 'We did ask; why didn't you say you are closing? We wouldn't have ordered in that case.' He then called us entitled assholes and left. That comment was quite funny since my girlfriend had worked as a server before.\n\nSo, any thoughts on this?EDIT 1: I for some reason forgot to write this down, after we asked for take out, they did not respond, they gave us a plate for the cake and a cup for ice cream.EDIT 2: They didn't give us a take out order they served the cake on a plate and the ice cream in a mug/cup.", "created_utc": 1691012698, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15gkxhy/aita_for_ordering_after_the_staff_told_me_they/", "score": 852, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

I let him in and told him I\u2019d make his sandwich as long as he made it quick.  All was well until he paid for his sub and then proceeded to go to a table and take down a chair.

I don\u2019t care where you eat it actually, it just can\u2019t be here.
