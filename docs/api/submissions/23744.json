Normally, the place closes at 21:30, and it was around 21:40, so we weren't sure if they would still sell us anything. We wanted to ask the staff if it's okay to buy something; we didn't even want to sit. In a polite manner, we asked, 'Good evening, are you still open? Can we order, especially for take away? 'The staff responded, 'Just tell me what do you want? 'We ordered a small cake and an ice cream. As we were about to pay, we double-checked with them if this was okay, as they were looking at us weirdly. The cashier didn't respond and showed the POS to pay. We took our order and sat down. While we were about to eat, I heard one of the staff members, who was leaving their shift (not wearing their uniform), looking at us and muttering about why people keep coming and why they're still sitting to other coworkers. As politely as I could, I told him, 'We did ask; why didn't you say you are closing? We wouldn't have ordered in that case.' He then called us entitled assholes and left.

Most are small businesses, locally owned, and these things are more or less decided collectively.\n\nEdit: and yeah, business hours are merely a suggestion, a restaurant might close two hours earlier or two hours later. And even when it closes, it might still be open to serving neighborhood regulars that use it as their own living room, if some of the staff enjoys staying for that.

We weren't allowed to close our doors for 10 minutes after close because someone made a joke to a customer that asked if we were closed and the customer got all snotty and called to complain. We also had to keep the doors open and serve new customers as long as there was someone sitting in the store. We also weren't allowed to start some of our closing duties until the doors shut, like mopping, because it could be taken as a passive aggressive way to tell customers to leave. This meant that despite \"closing\" at 11 pm, and having a closing shift \"end\" around 11:30-12, there were nights that we didn't get to leave until 1 am, sometimes later, all because some stoner wanted to eat his large ice cream as slowly as he could, or some couple who had already finished eating was giggling and making out at the tables.\n\nThey definitely wanted you to leave OP. It wasn't cool to go in. Even if a place is still operating, it doesn't mean you should go in if it's after their normal hours. The employees likely can't say no, and they have work to do even after the customer facing of the store closes, and you could be delaying them getting home to their families, or plans, or maybe just their dinner by an hour or more.\n\nYTA.
