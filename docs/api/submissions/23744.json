We wanted to ask the staff if it's okay to buy something; we didn't even want to sit. IN a polite manner, we asked, 'Good evening, are you still open? Can we order, especially for take away? 'The staff responded, 'Just tell me what do you want? 'We ordered a small cake and an ice cream. As we were about to pay, we double-checked with them if this was okay, as they were looking at us weirdly. The cashier didn't respond and showed the POS to pay. We took our order and sat down. While we were about to eat, I heard one of the staff members, who was leaving their shift (not wearing their uniform), looking at us and muttering about why people keep coming and why they're still sitting to other coworkers.

Where I grew up we had places like this and they would just stay open until things quieted down so the hours on the door didn\u2019t mean anything. I also worked in hospitality/retail for over a decade so I sympathise with the staff. Maybe they really want to close at that exact time and aren\u2019t allowed.
