What's his reason for them to have a playroom when they each have their own room plus the living room AND the back yard? As others have said, craft stuff takes up a lot of room.

They can't miss what they never had.\n\nHe gets to set up a space for his hobby. How do you think he would like it if he had to drag all of his gaming stuff out each time he wanted to play?

Sewing and art take up space, so it's not unreasonable to ask for a spare room.

If they have separate bedrooms it should be enough space for them to play.", "It's not unreasonable to want an alone space. NTA.

I don't have so much stuff that it would take up the whole room. Thank you!", "This is the best idea!!!!!!\n\nOP said they are both girls. A shared room, even a cute divider of sorts, for sleeping and their own playroom is a good way to contain the mess. As they get older and less into toys, they can choose to separate or maybe the playroom becomes more like a preteen hangout with desks, gaming console, who knows. \n\nAnd the spare room also shared by mom and dad.

There are a few special stuffed animals, but even with those we are teaching them to take care of other people's special things and that it's good to share things you love with people who might also love them. \n\nIn a few years they will probably want separate bedrooms,  but until then it's really nice to keep the toys contained to one main space.  OP's husband isn't wrong that a playroom is a nice thing to have,  but OP needs space, too, and he's not taking that into account.", "Don't forget cluttering up the bedroom at the same time with sewing supplies.

But adults need a room to do crafts, gaming etc so that the other person can still have a lie down if unwell, or sleep at night if the other is still active.
