When coming back from a walk with my boyfriend \\[M24\\], I \\[F23\\] fell down the stairs and broke my ankle. After it happened, he asked me if I want to see the doctor or not. As I thought the pain in my ankle will eventually pass, I said \"No\" and we went back home. One hour later, when my ankle became 3 times as big as it normally is, I eventually decided to go to hospital - it was Sunday 9pm, so I had no other choice than going to the ER. When I said to my boyfriend, that I decided to go to hospital he just said okay and asked me, how I am going to get there. No offering to go with me, he just continued to lay in bed and watch Netflix. To be fair, I did not asked if he could please come with me - I guess I was just waiting for him to offer it. \n\nWhen I came back home (it was 2am) he woke u and we started talking. Then I asked him, why he did not go with me to the ER. He said that (1) it was already pretty late, he knew it would take so long, and he had to go to work on the next day ; (2) as I did not say my ankle hurts that much he did not realise it was that serious; and (3) he asked me to go see the doctor first, but I refused. therefore he did not see the point of my later, \"sudden\" wish of going to see the doctor when it was already late.\n\nI somehow can see his point with the 3rd argument, but the others are just strange to me...Since the accident, he helps me (in his own kind) but I cannot get rid of this feeling of being frustrated and sad that he left me alone and seemed to not care. I feel that I cannot rely on him and that he only helps when he feels like it. I feel like I have been a little mean to him ever since and that I am the asshole for expecting from him to go to the ER with me and that he did not. \n\n&#x200B;", "created_utc": 1699955327, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17uyw2l/aita_for_being_frustrated_that_my_boyfriend_m24/", "score": 28, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Immediately after the accident you were running on adrenaline. In time that wore off and the pain hit you. \n\nNot knowing where you live, (so I don\u2019t know if you didn\u2019t want to go because medical bills in some countries are expensive) you could have gone anyway. \n\nBut once you said it hurt and is serious he should have helped.", "NTA. I would feel frustrated too. He didn't notice you were in pain later? He didn't notice your ankle had swollen so much? Even then, you ask to go to the ER, can't he just realize you don't do that without a reason and come support you?\n\nI think you are better on your own instead of with someone who doesn't care enough to pay attention or support you.", "NTA. You didn't realize it was serious until it was swollen, which is understandable. (And it was only an hour later! It would have been Sunday night just as much at 8 PM as it was at 9 PM.) He asked how you would get there, so he knew it would be a challenge. And when you asked him why he didn't come (at a point when you BOTH knew your ankle was broken), he didn't apologize - he explained why he thought he was justified. \"I already offered and you said no so you lost out\"? Really? (Surely you weren't hiding your three-times-the-size ankle?) \n\nThis doesn't sound like someone I would want to be with.", "NTA I'd feel as if he didn't care for me tbh", "No, there's no way even his 3rd point is valid. When you fell you didn't think it was serious. Then you realized it was. It wasn't you \"suddenly changed your mind\".\n\nHe was insensitive and an AH and I wouldn't trust him to be there for me when I needed in the future.\n\nI don't care what time it is, if my partner needs to go to the ER you're damn right I'm going with him.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Wow, I\u2019m shocked by the ESH and I feel bad for your partners. I don\u2019t need to be asked to go to the ER with my husband. If he says he needs to go, I just grab my stuff and drive him there. It is insane that people expect her to have to ask him. This is like relationship 101z", "NTA. I would never make my partner go to the hospital alone if it was possible for me to go with them. I would always offer to go with them if they wanted company and reassurance. I like my partner and want to be there for them in times of need. Don't listen to these jerks suggesting that you are at fault here. You shouldn't have to ask. Your BF is an inconsiderate jerk.", "NTA \nHe should have known it was serious when you decided to go to the ER instead of wait until next morning!", "NTA. Only read the title. He doesn't need to be your boyfriend to witness you getting injured and take you to the ER. It is basic good samaritan stuff. Neighbourliness. Humanity.", "Wait, you ankle was swelling up and he didn\u2019t even offer to drive? That\u2019s very uncaring. NTA", "NTA\n\nI was going to say ESH right up until his third 'excuse'. Yes, you should've just flat out asked him to take you to the hospital. Even in a relationship, sometimes you still have to point out what should be obvious to most. However, communication should happen irregardless.\n\nBut then, he had to say the third thing. \"You changed your mind!\" Are you fucking serious?! Your ankle literally swole to three times its size and the pain hit after the adrenaline that was released from the initial injury was wearing off, and he says that?! If your partner says I need to go to the hospital, it's worse than I/we thought, his first response should've been 'Are you okay? Let's go get you looked at!' NOT tell you 'Oh you changed your mind and it was late' .\n\nIf that's his default response to any situation like that, his factory setting is asshole.", "NTA. You fell and injured your ankle, maybe it's broken. So, when the pain hits, how are you going to walk? How would you drive? That alone would be plain logical that I as partner get you to the ER. If I need to stay or could go back home, could be determined later.", "\u201cHow are you going to get there?\u201d was his way of flat-out telling you he wasn\u2019t interested in supporting you, now, or during any future emergencies. NTA.", "Why are you with someone who does not care about you?", "NTA. Even if he couldn\u2019t stay the whole time, the least he could do would be to get you there.", "NTA. It's normal not to realise how serious an injury is right away. However, it's possible that you could have communicated better. You could have asked \"Could you please take me to the ER?\". In case you didn't, you could have said \"Look, it's swollen, it hurts like hell, and I think it needs urgent medical attention.\"  \n\n\nIn my opinion, many women hesitate to make a request and state their needs. I don't blame them, and I understand why this is the case \u2013 unfortunately, many women were brought up to be modest and shy \u2013 but then there is a risk that other people don't fully understand your needs. I suspect that your boyfriend understood perfectly well both the problem and the extent of it, as well as the implicit request behind it, but in general, people can be frustrated if you get mad at them for not doing something that you didn't ask them to do.", "NTA. Once happened something similar to me. I was home for 3 days with pain, at som point I decided to go to the ER, my bf was at work and I informed him. I told him to not worry, but he insisted and came to the hospital. If he cared, he would have come with you.", "NTA, but honey, it's time to dump his sorry ass and get a new partner who is a human. Most people would go to the ER even for their roommates, let alone their partners. So no, you are NTA, but he is a shitty person for sure.", "ESH\n\nYou for not asking him to go with you if that\u2019s what you wanted. \n\nHim for his third excuse: your injury had gotten worse in that hour and was more visible. You get to change your mind under these circumstances without being seen as inconsistent. And also for not asking if you wanted him to take you, given that you were in pain and mobility impaired. \n\nBut maybe stop being mean to him and punishing him for it. Maybe you both can learn from this experience.", "NAH,\n\nPeople are differently concerned about injuries. For example people doing sports who get injured a lot tend to not care about minor injuries that much. Tbh i wouldn't expect my GF to go with me to the ER for something like that, but i can also see why you would like him to come. Why didn't you just ask him?", "Are you sure he is your boyfriend/partner? Or he is just an acquaintance from the office?", "Info: what time did he have to be at work the next day?", "ESH\n\nYou make up your mind and learn to recognize when something's off. If it hurts to the point that you can't put down your foot, it's probably broken and it definitely won't pass that easily. \n\nHe could show a bit more care and take you to the hospital. Depending on the job he has of course. If it's a job where you can easily skip a day without consequences because you had an emergency during the night, why shouldn't you?", "ESH\n\nYou could simply have answered \"I thought you'd take me\" when he asked how you'll get there. But you remained silent - so that's up to you.\n\nBut he still sucks for not even offering to take you there. He wouldn't have to stay until the end if it really got late, but at least as emotional support and company during waiting times.\nAfter you would have been fixed up an uber or taxi probably would have been fine for the way back if he isn't around anymore.", "ESH. Since your boyfriend didn't post this, let me tell you something about playing the guessing game with your SO. It's stupid. It's childish. It will fail you every time unless your partner has a pet pig that can see the future. Are you seriously upset that somebody didn't read your mind and guess your wishes? Grow up. Immediately. \n\nYour boyfriend is an AH by his default setting, but your communication was terrible and the cause of your own anger.", "People are not mind readers. You are a passive aggressive. See where that behavior got you \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "NAH, but leaning a little towards you for continuing to jab at him about it. That's not helping you and it's certainly not helping him. It may not be fair but it's always better to live and let live rather than holding onto a grievance.", "ESH you for expecting him to read your mind and not going in right away. Him for not asking if you needed him with you.", " ESH. There is some good advice on this thread about communication. This sounds like a classic case of not understanding how A relationship works, you are both pretty young. You have to be honest about what you need and want in the moment, your bf is not a mind reader. He, however, should not be okay with you going to the ER without him since that\u2019s stressful and you were in pain. Relationships are work, you guys are getting the chance to do some.", "ESH. Not his \u201cfault\u201d for not coming with you. Woulda been nice if he did tho.", "ESH. He sucks because he knows you were injured and if you truly care about someone you would accompany them to the hospital. He seems like the kind of person who would leave their partner if they get cancer.\n\nYour communication skills suck. If we give him the benefit of the doubt because maybe he underestimated your injury, even though your ankle was swollen, you could've asked him directly to take you to the hospital. If he refused because he had work the next day, at least you know where his priorities are", "MaybeTA. generaly it\u2019s just a default expectstion for the partner to help you with going to the doctor when hurt. on the other hand i can see why he wouldn\u2019t think much of it since you made it seem less of a problem than that ankle was and right now i am at work after not sleeping the whole night, so i emphasize with him a little more.", "YTA for being mean to him. It\u2019s your right to be frustrated because it seems like you had expectations that weren\u2019t met but it is childish to be mean instead of sorting it out. You talked about it but it sounds like it wasn\u2019t enough for you to move on. May be have another discussion were you express your frustration and future expectations and he can express his and his boundaries.\n\nA trip to the ER is something you might want support for but an ankle injury isn\u2019t something life threatening or unknown. And being the ER, you know it\u2019s going to take time. Did you expect him to take time from work or to go to work tired the next day? \n\nI would understand if you had some kind of a fever or some other symptoms that did not garantie you wouldn\u2019t pass out on the way, but an ankle isn\u2019t that kind of emergency. If you have another discussion, may be also discuss what kind of emergency would be a priority over work, because priorities are often not the same for everybody and that\u2019s were you have to find a compromise as a couple.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
