I\u2019ve had this surgery. Being only 6 days post-surgical puts you in a very delicate place for germs. Despite every effort, I got a very bad infection. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re still dealing with drains or  recently had them removed and/ extensive taping/dressings. He **must** be made to understand cleanliness. Take him to your next surgical appointment (drain removal/dressing changes?) and have this explained to him. \n\nWishing you a successful outcome", "NTA for the request but why oh why this wasn't an issue until now?! So many posts about gross stinky men, ffs girls you deserve so much better", "The bare minimum. \n\nYou're asking for the bare minimum. \n\nYou're asking your husband, an adult, to help you reduce your risk of a post-surgical infection by performing an act of hygiene that, for most of us, is part of our daily routine anyway. You're only asking for this while you're imminently at risk for infection. That's... what, a week or two? \n\nWhy some people need to be asked to do the bare minimum for a spouse they ostensibly love is beyond me. Him balking at the ask is even more unfathomable. \n\nIf there's some really genuinely good reason why a once-daily shower is impossible for him, he could also just go ahead and sleep on the couch. \n\nYou're NTA. You wouldn't be TA if you asked for this in general, and you certainly aren't in this context.", "NTA. \n\nWorking any manual labour and not showering immediately upon getting home (let alone getting into bed) is absolutely disgusting and he should be ashamed with himself. \n\nHe should not be allowed in the bed at all unless he showers. \n\nIf he doesn't comply with what is literally the bare minimum requirement for sharing a living space (let alone a bed) with another human being, buy him a dog bed and he can sleep on that in the laundry until he chooses to act like a human being.\n\nAnd all of that is before considering the need for cleanliness posed by recent surgery.", "NTA but I wonder how his lack of hygiene was not ever an issue \ud83d\ude33 I get no shower in the morning but after all day of work, doing things, being outside, sweating it's kinda more than I can comprehend. Guess you don't mind him filthy.\nAnd I don't appreciate how manipulative this question is: open wounds. It's beyond exaggerated. 6 days post op is definitely not open and should have a light dressing around it anyway.", "NTA. The guy moves furniture. He's sweating and filthy. Even without the surgery aspect I'd not be sharing a bed.", "No I think that\u2019s a very reasonable request. It would be reasonable to ask even if you didn\u2019t just have surgery. I would say he is more of TA for giving you attitude about it. Does he have too much pride or something? I\u2019m sorry to hear about that.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Why do so many women get into relationships with and then marry men with abysmal hygiene? I\u2019d much rather be alone than tolerate this at all.", "NTA, I mean cmon. First of, I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through that. Bathing after any strenuous activity should  and is normal. Not bathing despite your wife\u2019s surgery even after being ASKED to bathe is just wild to me. \n\nI agree, you need to have a respectful conversation with him but ASSERT yourself girl! Judging by his initial response, it will be a hard conversation to have but it\u2019s important to you because it affects your health.", "No. You should shower every night before bed. It\u2019s important for people with allergies, especially.", "Gross. Can you get your own bed if this is normal for him? Or just spray this fucker down with a hose before you let him in the house?", "You are absolutely NTA for not wanting to share a bed with a man who was moving furniture all day and did not shower. But don't tell me him what to do, just tell him what would you do: not share a bed with a man who does not shower after a day of hard labor.\n\nJust work out some agreement how to go to bed without you having to be affected by smell and germs, it doesn't have to be him showering, it could be you or him sleeping in a different bed.", "If he doesn't want to shower, I'd just go and sleep on the couch or in the spare room. Yours isn't an unreasonable request. But, I don't think you should hash it out before you lay down to sleep. I'd readdress it another day when I'm feeling calm and more detached from his nonsense.\n\nNTA. I'm sure the hospital gave you information about what facilitates your healing and what doesn't? Show it to your husband. Again, if necessary.", "You're not necessarily the \"asshole\" (as per the AITA subreddit), but it's important to approach this situation with understanding and empathy, considering both your health concerns and your husband's feelings.\r  \n\r  \nYour request for your husband to shower before coming to bed, especially when you have open wounds due to surgery, is a reasonable one from a hygiene and health perspective. In such a situation, it's essential to minimize the risk of infection and maintain a clean environment to aid in your recovery.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, it's equally important to have a respectful and open conversation with your husband about your concerns and the reasons behind your request. Make sure he understands the importance of your post-surgery recovery and how his work-related dirt and germs can potentially affect it. Encourage him to express his feelings and concerns as well, so you can work together to find a solution that respects both your needs.", "Definitely NTA for pointing out that you require clean bedding while your open wounds are healing.", "NTA. One, you share a bed and no one should be forced to sleep with someone else's funk. Two, you just had surgery and are in a tender spot right now. I'm pretty sure his sweat and stink won't carry any extra germs, but still. A general rule is to be reasonably accommodating to people recovering from surgery.", "NTA. He knows better but chooses not to do better. Your request is reasonable.", "I don\u2019t believe you would be the asshole here, but you could come off as one. Let him know about open wounds, and your concerns about it. You make it sound like he hasn\u2019t showered since high school PE class\u2026 dunno.", "Do you have dressings on the wounds cause if you do, then what he does, shouldn't affect you at all. The whole idea of dressings is to provide a barrier to the outside world for wound healing. And they have to be changed regularly. \n\nAre you an a hole, I don't know but like be realistic. If they don't usually shower before bed, asking them to change that habit and at times when they might be tired is a lot. Cut them some slack.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
