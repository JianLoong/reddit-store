Despite every effort, I got a very bad infection. \n\nI\u2019m sure you\u2019re still dealing with drains or  recently had them removed and/ extensive taping/dressings.

So many posts about gross stinky men, ffs girls you deserve so much better", "The bare minimum. \n\nYou're asking for the bare minimum. \n\nYou're asking your husband, an adult, to help you reduce your risk of a post-surgical infection by performing an act of hygiene that, for most of us, is part of our daily routine anyway. You're only asking for this while you're imminently at risk for infection. That's... what, a week or two? \n\nWhy some people need to be asked to do the bare minimum for a spouse they ostensibly love is beyond me. Him balking at the ask is even more unfathomable. \n\nIf there's some really genuinely good reason why a once-daily shower is impossible for him, he could also just go ahead and sleep on the couch. \n\nYou're NTA. You wouldn't be TA if you asked for this in general, and you certainly aren't in this context.", "NTA. \n\nWorking any manual labour and not showering immediately upon getting home (let alone getting into bed) is absolutely disgusting and he should be ashamed with himself. \n\nHe should not be allowed in the bed at all unless he showers. \n\nIf he doesn't comply with what is literally the bare minimum requirement for sharing a living space (let alone a bed) with another human being, buy him a dog bed and he can sleep on that in the laundry until he chooses to act like a human being.\n\nAnd all of that is before considering the need for cleanliness posed by recent surgery.", "NTA but I wonder how his lack of hygiene was not ever an issue \ud83d\ude33 I get no shower in the morning but after all day of work, doing things, being outside, sweating it's kinda more than I can comprehend. Guess you don't mind him filthy.\nAnd I don't appreciate how manipulative this question is: open wounds. It's beyond exaggerated. 6 days post op is definitely not open and should have a light dressing around it anyway.", "NTA. The guy moves furniture. He's sweating and filthy. Even without the surgery aspect I'd not be sharing a bed.", "No I think that\u2019s a very reasonable request. It would be reasonable to ask even if you didn\u2019t just have surgery.

First of, I\u2019m so sorry you have to go through that. Bathing after any strenuous activity should  and is normal. Not bathing despite your wife\u2019s surgery even after being ASKED to bathe is just wild to me. \n\nI agree, you need to have a respectful conversation with him but ASSERT yourself girl!

In such a situation, it's essential to minimize the risk of infection and maintain a clean environment to aid in your recovery.\r  \n\r  \nHowever, it's equally important to have a respectful and open conversation with your husband about your concerns and the reasons behind your request.

One, you share a bed and no one should be forced to sleep with someone else's funk. Two, you just had surgery and are in a tender spot right now. I'm pretty sure his sweat and stink won't carry any extra germs, but still. A general rule is to be reasonably accommodating to people recovering from surgery.", "NTA. He knows better but chooses not to do better. Your request is reasonable.", "[deleted]", "Do you have dressings on the wounds cause if you do, then what he does, shouldn't affect you at all. The whole idea of dressings is to provide a barrier to the outside world for wound healing. And they have to be changed regularly. \n\nAre you an a hole, I don't know but like be realistic.
