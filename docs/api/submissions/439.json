{"id": 439, "submission_id": "ygtghg", "title": "UPDATE: AITA for wanting my husband to start paying more for our housing?", "selftext": "An update to the [2020 post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/f9tgvs/aita_for_wanting_my_husband_to_start_paying_more/)\n\nI sincerely apologize for taking so long to return to Reddit and write an update to this. A lot has happened since. For those who don\u2019t know, this post was originally written at the end February of 2020. The world, therefore after, fell apart. \n\nThings were\u2026 not good with me and my husband at the time of this post. I want to preface this by saying we are still together to this day - and we\u2019ve welcome and new child to the world - this time in a much healthier environment.\n\nCOVID changed a lot for me, along with the intense virality of the last post. Neither my husband or I got laid off of furloughed (and we were and are so thankful) but my husband moved to work from home. That perspective shift changed a lot for him when he say what I had to deal with day to day - things I could never properly communicate about how difficult it is to work while raising a child and what I brought to the table that he could never see. Despite his newfound appreciation for me, I still found myself resenting him. \n\nIt was in June that I finally proposed that we go to couples counseling, after doing my own virtual therapy sessions since March (from which I learned about why I let people step over me based on my childhood and past and how to overcome that).\n\nTo my surprise, my husband agreed and so we\u2019ve been in weekly counseling since - even to this day. It helped him get to the root of his fears and address why he has trouble trusting me financially - which had less to do with me and more to do with what he was brought up believing and had been instilled with. After coming to the point of telling him I wouldn\u2019t want to continue building a family or a life with him where he watched me struggle from luxury (with the help of our amazing counselor who guided us), my husband was willing to adjust our lifestyle to be more equal.\n\nI\u2019m not saying everything was or is magically perfect. I know people wanted an update where I left my evil husband and took my baby to start a new life but I did marry this man for reason - I saw the good - and past this struggle we\u2019ve had to overcome, he\u2019s become the man I knew I\u2019d married.\n\nWe now have a joint bank account as well our own on the side. We each put 2/3rds of our income into the shared account and get to keep 1/3rd for ourselves. I am in a new job now and making much more money than in the original post (not that this effects the relationship, but so people know my 1/3rd is enough for me to enjoy).\n\nIt\u2019s still a road to recovery but we have more trust between us and are no longer living a 50/50 lifestyle.\n\nAgain, I\u2019m sorry for not updating sooner, but the past few years have been  a lot for us (and everyone).\n\nThank you all for your support and advice - I promise I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here typing this without it.", "created_utc": 1667074272, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ygtghg/update_aita_for_wanting_my_husband_to_start/", "score": 3637, "replies": ["Wow a post of three years ago got an update. I am happy everything is on track to getting better!", "While I'm glad he has changed his ways, I do hope this also means he's finally contributing to household chores, cooking and childcare, because him expecting you to do ALL of that was a huge part of the equation in many people thinking this marriage could not be saved.\n\nI also hope you consider bringing up both \"backpay\" of sorts that could go into your retirement account, because you were at such an extreme disadvantage for so long, or agree to a postnup.

I feel like this sub isn\u2019t happy unless someone is getting dumped or cut out. So unhealthy. They\u2019re the problem, not you. Good luck OP.", "Man, OPs husband family really did a number on him.

But please tell me he now understands how wrong he was for saying he wouldn't pay for you to be a mother. That gutted me.", "I fucking LOVE when there is a happy update... I just... Kudos to the two of you. Love and life are HARD things to navigate and it fills me with glee to see the two of you navigating to the same place. Its a hard journey, as it always be.

I hope the two of you (and your two kids!!!) continue this growth forward!", "I'm so glad things are working out for you!\n\nI was engaged to a very wealthy man once, and working to prove I wasn't after the money I hadn't initially known he had was exhausting and frequently left me at a large financial disadvantage.

Awesome to see things got better :)", "Whew this is good to hear this is how it should be. God bless your family that was nice", "Wow.  Thanks for the update.  I am so glad to see that your husband came to an eye opening moment and changed his behaviour. Sure the whole thing is a first world problem, neither of you are poor, but relationships have their own problems regardless of class statis. Personally I have never been in a relationship where money was not shared and provided for where needed - and I have never been married, just lived with partners - everything was just shared.  If I got married then I assume I would share everything. My parents never had individual bank accounts (well until my dad became a gambling addict and mum threatened divorce unless she took control of the lot, thankfully that is all way in the past.)", "Sounds like a great resolution, I'm glad you're both happier and I'm glad your husband was willing to work things out.", ">I\u2019m not saying everything was or is magically perfect.

You did well!", "I'm glad to hear that you're both getting couples' counseling, and that he's truly working with it.\n\nHonestly, the reason I often tell people to leave their spouse/partner on this sub is because very few people who do things that are seriously wrong are willing to work on their own human issues that caused the problem.   It's a very hard thing to face.\n\nMost people double-down rather than have the courage and strength to really change those issues.   Particularly if they're blaming the other person for their own shortcomings.", "I'm glad you two are happy right now and I hope you guys keep going to couples therapy and working on him making amends for that time. Cuz I'm happy that you're happy, if the whole path of your marriage is that the only way to heal is by just moving on and forgetting that that happened, your marriage isn't actually going to heal. He really should be making amends to you for not treating you like a partner and trying to show you that he actually wants to build a trusting relationship with you.\n\nPerhaps you two should talk about in couples therapy having an edit done on the prenup. Because it feels fundamentally wrong that you guys have an agreement in place that directly disadvantages you if you two were to separate when you two have children together. If you can't do it just for yourself and wanting to be treated like an equal by your partner, you should do it because you have kids involved now, and if you do get divorced, still using an agreement that was made treating you like an outsider and entirely bent on screwing you over is to the direct disadvantage of your children", "This is such an awesome update to read. It's your life, so you've made the best decisions *for you* and it's obvious that he's not the evil, horrible husband people thought when they read your first post. While there are still concerns, those are things that he and you need to address in therapy. I'm glad the therapy is working for you, and it sounds like a pandemic lockdown was a small blessing for you two.

I think the original prenup might be garbage. It might be worse to sign one now. From her original \"I did sign a prenup that was overseen by his family attorney.\"\n\nThe whole 'prenup are useless' argument is because they get thrown out in court is due to the startling amount a lawyers and clients who do them incorrectly. They can be tossed out for several reasons but a big one is *you need two separate lawyers one representing for each spouse.* So *she* used *his family lawyer?* Uh-oh.

Considering the income differences, I do not understand why the husband would not be proud to be paying for all the everyday needs and letting his wife save her money for fun things, either for herself, them as a couple or the family as a whole.

He's better, but OP's husband is an ass and is still not pulling his weight.", "This is my beef! My husband and I pool our money so even though he's contributing slightly more to bills, we get the same amount of fun money. We both work full-time jobs and we're not \"keeping score.\" Marriage is a partnership. Obviously different couples have different things that work for them, but why wouldn't you want your partner to have the same level of comfort as you?", "That's the part that get me. In these situations, it's recommended that you do it proportionally so unless she's making the same as her husband now, she's still being taken advantage of.", "Yeah he has a long way to go (destroying that pre-nup has to happen) but I am heaps happy for OP and seeing that progress has been made.  Imagine being in a rich family that earns over $400k together a year and somehow money is an issue .... ?!?!", "Yeah, same here. He seems to lack empathy... it's sad and scary.", "Yep, it couldnt be me. Even now he is still doing the bare minimum.", "Ditto, but he seems to be slowly coming around, so I am proud of OP.  Keep at it OP, you are not there yet, but you are well on the way.", "To put it plainly we're raining on the parade cuz it feels like she's just throwing out confetti to try and cover up that they still have major issues that are going to negatively affect their kids. \n\nWe can say that we're happy for her that she's happy, but she still needs to go out there and insist that her husband get individual therapy because he had fundamentally no empathy for her and married her without considering her a partner, and that they should get a post-nuptial done since their original prenup is entirely geared towards screwing her, and if he actually views her as a partner that should be a step that he wants to take. Why would he want his partner who he loves and respects and is the mother of his children screwed over if they get a divorce?", "This was my thought.

My totally uneducated guess is that a prenup was used as a power play against someone who didn't realize what they were signing away and that court case set the precedent, but again, total guess. Most of the reasons to invalidate seem based on that idea. But prenups used to allow all sorts of things they don't now (at least don't in some states) eg clauses for infidelity, child support, child custody, etc \n\nAs for boundaries, one of the things I found while looking for an article to site was that the law (at least in CA) wants the couple to have explored other options for keeping money with only one side - trusts, separate accounts, etc.- before going to a prenup. Maybe prenups are losing favor? IDK.", "Good thing I'm not calling him heroic or noble.\n\nYou want bigger measures to be taken. You are not OP.
