Parents need to stop using technology to track their adult children. You're too old to be put on an electric leash.", "NTA\n\nLOL, **_after_** college...\n\n> **when** you get kidnapped and tortured\n\n*When??* The hell is she planning?", "NTA\n\nI don't really get why you aren't turning it off already, honestly. Maybe I'd compromise and wait until graduation if it were *only* being checked when there's legitimate concern that something has happened, but that's not what she's doing.\n\nIf your dad doesn't already have it on his phone, he should install it and keep it forever since it's no big deal to be tracked 24/7. Wouldn't want him to get kidnapped, y'know.", "NTA and I'd turn it off now or get yourself a new phone and leave this one in your dorm.  The likelihood of you being kidnapped and tortured is pretty slim to non existent and this is paranoid behavior.  Your mom is probably my age (I'm 42) and we spend entire summers unsupervised.  When she was in school, no one was tracking her 24/7.  I'd ask her where she's gotten these ideas.", "NTA. You parents are being paranoid and unreasonable. You are an adult and you do need privacy. They are having a hard time letting go and struggling to come to terms that you're no longer a kid. You need your independence young man, good luck to you.", "Find your nearest strip club and ask the bouncer outside if he can keep your phone in his pocket for a few hours. Do this as often as necessary.", "NTA. This tracking BS is just nutty. You have the right to privacy and autonomy. End of story. \n\nKnowing where your ADULT child is 24 hours a day is not 'peace of mind.' It's invasive and creepy.", "NTA\n\nIts wild to me. As a person who went to college in the early 90s, we had a phone in our rooms (which we shared with a room mate) and cell phones were not a thing. Let alone tracking. I'd call home once, maybe twice per week. \n\nThat said, I love Life 360. I don't really use it to track my kids, but it is REALLY nice to be able to locate one of my kids' phones when they can't find them (almost always lost at school sporting event). Its nice to have the option of locating my minor children if they are not answering. But I can't imagine tracking my children as adults.", "Why would they leave your phone on you if they were kidnapping or torturing you? I mean really!\n\nEdit to say NTA", "NTA.\n\nA parent's job is to help their children grow into capable and **independent adults**. Your Mom is doing the opposite. **She is infantilizing you.** You should turn the tracker off now. \n\nYou should have a chat with her about her paranoia. When she was in college did her parents track her every move? What makes her think that's a good idea with you? Honestly, she seems to be struggling with some kind of **mental health issue** here.", "Do you get lost easily ? Have no sense of direction ? That is honestly the only reason I can see for a Family member to want to do this .NTA OP.", "You are an adult, my friend. \nYour mother has a mental illness and if you weren't forced to consent out of fear of monetary reprisal her tracking you would be illegal. If the result of you not wanting to be tracked caused them to pull the funding for your future, they are the exact opposite of the good parents you claim them to be.", "NTA. You are an adult and if you want to remove the tracker, that is your choice to make. Your father and brother are probably only telling you to keep it because they don't want to deal with any drama from your mother's reaction. It sounds like she has complained about it to them and they have decided that telling you to back down is the easiest way to calm her down/shut her up because there are no negative consequences for them. Do they also have trackers?", "Nta", "NTA. You are an adult. You can turn it off or remove the app now if you want to. Most of us do just fine without being tracked, and her \"peace of mind\" is her problem not yours. \n\nI wouldn't even bother warning her ahead of time, but I suppose giving her time to get used to the idea might make sense to you.", "NTA - I\u2019m not a proponent of tracking apps but that being said, you\u2019re an adult and you\u2019ve set an exceedingly reasonable deadline for using the app. Be safe and fly the nest :)", "Going to college was the one time I actually needed it. But honestly if you have an apple iPhone you can mess with 3 different tracking parts (tracking service, cellular, iCloud sharing, iMessage sharing, etc) that all play a part in good tracking. (It just looks like it never loads correctly)\n\nI discovered this by accident lol, but once you leave college I immediately stopped giving a shit what my parents thought (as long as I was being respectful and reasonable let\u2019s be real I\u2019m not a complete schmuck) and where I was going. I think it might be the anxiety in both of you talking, just let life happen and natural maturity will show)", "Right, when you get kidnapped and they let you keep your phone instead of smashing it or throwing it into the woods. \n\nNTA", "You\u2019re an adult, don\u2019t tell then just do it", "NTA, that would be your mom.  I don't track my children, oldest is away on the East Coast for college youngest starts next fall.  Your mom, needs boundaries.

I think unless she does something  egregious there is not a reason to turn it off. \n\nTo each it\u2019s own but it\u2019s always nice for someone to be able to know where you are or at least help you find your phone if it ever gets lost. \n\nNAH", "NTA but for what it\u2019s worth me (26m) and a bunch of my friends have trackers enabled that our families have access to. I feel like as a paranoid leaning person you\u2019d want that added security even more?", "My son is 24 now and we have never had tracker apps in our family, it just never occurred to us. He moved many states away when he was 19 without a tracker app and I missed him a whole lot but I didn't track his whereabouts jesus.\nEdited typo and NTA obv", "NTA. \n\nDude, most of the population gets around just fine without our family tracking us at all times. Your mom thinking you're going to get abducted says *waaay* more about her mental state than your actual safety.", "NTA turn it off. Your parents need to train themselves not to worry. I speak as a parent with a daughter off at university. I never worry about her (unless she tells me she has a problem or is upset) because I trust her to use her common sense to keep herself safe. There are no guarantees, but living your life in fear is a terrible idea.", "NTA.  Your mom sounds like a worry wart, for lack of a better term. When I was in my 20s and traveling to see my folks (plane or car) my mom insisted that I call her to let her know I was okay/arrived safely. I finally told her I wouldn\u2019t do that as it presumed a problem would occur. If she didn\u2019t hear from me I was okay. If she did hear from me there was a problem. She didn\u2019t like the situation but she accepted it. Your mom is looking for some reassurance that you\u2019re okay.  You may need to figure something out if you do turn off the tracker.", "NTA - You are an adult and they need to realize that.  Its a realization that's going to be tough on them.  the fun conversation will take place in 20-30 years when you need them to install a similar app and use their own arguments.", "NAH I would have turned it off in high school, let alone after college lol, but I don\u2019t know if I would call her TA since she didn\u2019t try to tell you you had to leave it on.", "NTA.\n\nYou're 19 and already an adult.  You'll be in your early 20s when you graduate.  Do your parents plan on tracking you after you move out?  That's weird and creepy, not loving.\n\nGet rid of the tracker app.", "NTA but if you plan on living near your parents trust me it comes in handy. I can not tell you how many times I\u2019ve gotten them to pick me up food or something from the store cause I was being nosy and found out they were there. \n\nOn a more serious note it has also proven handy when I got into a car accident in the middle of nowhere and wasn\u2019t able to figure out exactly where I was.", "so, you are still gonna be on Mommy and Daddys phone plan when you graduate? lol", "NTA and it's weird AF to track an adult", "NTA, but IMHO telling her was a mistake.  In my experience, it's usually best to not \"warn\" parents about this kind of thing ahead of time.  Just turn the tracker off when you're ready, if they notice you can talk about it then.  Always easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.\n\nThe fact that she is currently using the app to follow you even when she knows you aren't missing or in danger, shows that your concern for your privacy is correct.  You are an adult, there is no reason for her to know whether or not you skip classes occasionally.\n\nMany women do have their location shared with a friend or two at all times as a safety measure, so it's not like it's unheard of for adults to share their location, although it's almost never with their parents.  I see that you're not a woman, and I know you mentioned you would prefer to not be tracked at all, but as a compromise perhaps if there is a friend or other relative you trust, you could allow one of them to track you in the event of an emergency.", "You should have turned it off the day you were 18 (or never allowed it at 19). It\u2019s completely inappropriate for adults to track other adults and it\u2019s only been this past generation that even had the ability. If it makes people anxious not to track they need therapy in dealing with the real world. (And before anyone asks if I have kids; my kids range in age from 12 to 22 and I track none of them.)", "NTA \n\nYou are an adult and it is weird that she wants to track you.", "Info. Do you pay for your own phone plan?", "This is funny, I turned mine back on because I travel for work a lot and have to rely on Lyft and Uber and I like both my parents and husband knowing where I am at.  I have had some really shady run ins with Uber drivers in cities I don\u2019t know and honestly it doesn\u2019t bother me.   I did turn it off when I needed to get a surprise gift,but that sent a notification and then everyone was like \u201cwhat were you doing\u201d and I got to play the part of super secret agen before a birthday.  I guess if you want your autonomy turn it off   I find it reassuring.", "Bro your 19 you should have deleted that shit a year ago wtf", "NTA- It\u2019s your choice weather you turn it off or leave it on. As for the autonomy that\u2019s a bullshit argument you ARE already an adult, your mommy can\u2019t tell you what to do. The privacy part makes more sense, but in reality what harm is there in your mom knowing you are going to the gym or a friends house. I am 25 years old and I have that app on my phone. My mom uses it to know I got home safe after work. It doesn\u2019t bother me at all, never has, because I established a clear boundary with her. She knows that I\u2019m an adult who can do and go what he wants. Personally I think you should leave it on it gives your mom peace of mind with almost no cost to you. That being said it is absolutely your right to delete the app if that\u2019s what you want, you don\u2019t owe anyone an explanation if your mom asks you for one just hit her with the old gem she gave you when you were a kid, \u201cbecause I said so\u201d.", "NTA but as a mom I understand why she wants it. It doesn't seem like she invading your privacy much by your own admission and maybe you guys can come to agreement that she'll only ever check it in an emergency once you graduate. If you don't want that it's completely your choice though, you're an adult and that's your choice. Personally I wouldn't mind my parents having it on me, I don't care if I frequented strip clubs lol. It's none of their business what I do. But in the event I ever go missing it'd be nice to be found, even if it's just my body \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
