You have an L2 in childcare and have been looking after your nieces for years! Here and there, sure, but from your post this sounds like a regular thing. You *are* babysitting, and missing college and medical appointments to look after the kids? Oh boy.\n\nCan you imagine the cost of a non-relative babysitting all the hours you\u2019ve looked after your nieces? I understand you\u2019re not feeling appreciated, and I would lovingly encourage you to put an end to this nonesense that you\u2019re *obliged* to look after your nieces. You\u2019re not. It shouldn\u2019t be something that is getting in the way for you- missing appointments is a no-go. Respectfully, you\u2019ve allowed this treatment for too long.\n\nCancel the weekend- I\u2019m sure you love your nieces, but this is on your sister (and mom?), you are not their servant, doormat nor their solution for every little thing. \n\nAll the best, naturally- NTA", "NTA. It's really unacceptable that you've had to cancel doctor appointments or miss college. Your nieces aren't your responsibility, they are your sister's. It's really kind that you've been willing to babysit for free, but it really sounds like you've been taken for granted. Congratulations on the job!", "In no way should you be missing class or doctor\u2019s appointments to babysit unpaid for your sister. \n\nRemember you\u2019re doing her a favor by taking care of her kids for free! and she has the cheek to demand you miss important things in your life for her kids. \n\nShe\u2019s the one who decided to have children. She is saving a lot of money by not paying you a dime (does she do other favors for you to reciprocate or does she just use your goodwill?)\n\nIn any case NTA if you cancel this weekend.", "Regardless of the rumor, you've grown up; you are starting a life, and your availability is now different. Fulfill any obligation you currently have to your sister, but after that, tell her \"no\" when she wants you to babysit. You don't have to engage with her; tell her, \"I'm not available,\" and stick to it. You may get a lot of pushback from her and your family, but stay strong. \n\nAnd you're never too old to go to university!", "NTA  If you babysit occasionally then for free is ok. But if you babysit registered they should be paying you. It\u2019s your sisters responsibility to take care of her kids. It\u2019s not yours. Cancel and move on with your life.", "NTA. Not your kids = not your problem. You've been too nice, now it's expected. Cancel this weekend, in fact, start canceling often. You need to start your own life, not waste your time fixing other people's problems.", "NTA. Looking after your nieces IS babysitting and you should be compensated for it. At the very least they ought to respect your time.", "NTA - You didn\u2019t have to do any of this because they\u2019re not your kids. You did it out of the kindness of your heart and your family took advantage of that. Fuck them if they don\u2019t appreciate it.", "NTA but let\u2019s circle back to the first part. \u201cIt\u2019s not babysitting it\u2019s watching your niece\u201d???\n\nIf you aren\u2019t that child\u2019s parent or legal guardian, it\u2019s babysitting.", "NTA. Cancel any and all babysitting, you're being taken advantage of horribly. \"It's looking after your nieces\" my arse, it's babysitting and you should have been paid for it. If you weren't available what would they have done? I'll bet there weren't any other free options around. Time to put yourself first for a change, and for the future.\n\nI have to take issue with one thing though: you are NOT too old for university. Every university will have thousands of students at undergraduate level your age or over. I know, it's those places where I worked. You won't be disadvantaged, quite the opposite. Older students bring more world experience with them and are commonly more committed. Set yourself some long term goals...and get after them. If you are prepared to make the effort - and it seems you are - then you can be anything you want to be. All the best.", "NTA.\n\nRegardless of if she said it or not, you are being massively taken advantage of.\n\nChildcare IS work.\n\nYou are literally getting a degree in it and are going to be paid for it. Your aunt is taking advantage of you. \n\nYou need to put you first and focus on getting you healthy, happy and employed. Your auntie can figure out her own parenting.", "NTA. You have been insanely generous to your sister and helped her out for years with no compensation. Frankly your sister took advantage of you. Babysitting for family is fine, when it\u2019s the odd Friday night every few weeks or one day when the baby can\u2019t go to nursery school because she is sick. What your describing is her using the bS \u201cbut it\u2019s family\u201d excuse to take advantage of you. Meanwhile you could ah e been developing experience that would be useful to you as you build  a career or at least had money to help with schooling. Absolutely your NTA. Good luck", "NTA.\n\nAlso, too old for university? Sweety, I'm a teacher and I have had students as old as 68. They are taking advantage of your kind heart.", "NTA. You\u2019re never too old for an education.", "YWNBTA. Doesn't matter if it's because of a rumor or that you just don't want to. You have every right to spend your time and effort as you want to. It's as simple as politely saying your not available unfortunately and leaving it at that. You do not have to defend why. \n\nDon't sell yourself short. Yes, things didn't go as planned with your studies, but that doesn't determine what your life will be. I did horrible at school and had serious health complications but never accepted being told I can't. Especially by my self. It was tough but today, years later, I'm in charge of research and development for a multimillion dollar tech company.\n\nYou took the first step and got your L2. The next step is the job (Congrats!). Every step in a journey is required to get to the destination. Be proud of each one and push for the next one.", "NTA\n\nYou have been taken advantage of very much to your detriment. Do not babysit your nieces (or anyone else) for free for one more minute.  The only way your should babysit this weekend is if you are paid (and at a very high rate, mind you).  Let your aunt know in advance, and demand payment in advance.  \n\nYou could also simply refused on the grounds that you want the exploitation to end.  Right now.", "NTA  \nBut stop babysitting like this. Do it if you won't regret it and you won't put your life on hold. At the end of the day, you won't have accomplished your dreams or your career, yet everyone's grown, established and moved on, what about you? What will you have? Will they help donate money for your college fund? If you work a dead-end job, would they help finance you at all or cover your medical bills since you miss your appointments to babysit and not care for yourself? You wouldn't expect them to, and not that they should, but in the end, you're leaving yourself in the dust  \n\n\nHow do you help others when you can't help yourself? Imagine your nieces are grown and they want something, but you can't afford to get it for them like how you did when they were young because you didn't better yourself and now they're older and want better things as they're grown now? Will you resent them because you put your life on hold and now you're so far behind you can't even get anything for yourself or them as gifts?   \n\n\nI'm just saying this because I did the same thing. I used to babysit all the time. I dropped out of college, missed appointments. And now I'm close to 30, no one sees that I'm great with kids and I babysat a lot, because it's not like they were my kids, and their parents WERE involved. What do they see instead? A 30 year old woman, no career, no degree, can barely support herself because the choices she made. I have nothing to show for all the love and whatever I did for my family. I don't regret it, but did I have to let my life pass me by either? No.", "NTA.   \nYou have been used for years. Either they pay you, at full rates, or you stop.", "They are taking advantage of you even if the rumor isn't true. Time to stand up for yourself. NTA.", "NTA pls op don't neglect your future for family pls don't miss college,exam etc for them", "NTA, but it sounds like you're being upset by the recent gossip more than the past history. It would be reasonable for your sister to mention you had a new job to someone you all know. \n\nIn your shoes, if I'd agreed to sit this weekend I'd still do it (because that's very short notice to cancel, and it seems you're thinking about cancelling because this other woman has been gossiping and speculating rather than anything your sister has actually done), but I wouldn't do any more after that. \n\nYes, arguably these are your sister's kids and it's her responsibility, and you're completely within your rights to cancel immediately, but the bigger issue here is making sure it stops happening - not this single occasion - and it might be easier in the long run to finish after the one you have offered to do. \n\nBe firm about future requests, and never, never compromise your own needs (college, doctor's appointments) for someone else.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
