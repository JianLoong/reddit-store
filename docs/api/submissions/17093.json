It's probably MORE stressful for her BECAUSE you don't think it needs cleaning,  so even if you do manage to stir yourself enough to do something,  it won't be to the standards she wants people to see her home in. \n\nHonestly,  the fact that she immediately got stressed tells me she already knows you're going to bare minimum this and she'll likely have both pre and post cleaning to deal with. \n\nUnless you're telling us your gf is irrational and has no basis in history for her reaction? Because ppl don't get stressed for no reason.", "And will all of those people still be there when she gets home?", "There is clean and there is guest clean.

She didn't invite you to her family celebration, she'll be absent for yours, and is stressed because she won't need to do anything? The living space belongs to both of you.

It\u2019s also her home and she probably wants to make a good impression on your family. I understand why you didn\u2019t think it would be fine but I would personally be stressed or frustrated if I had people suddenly visiting my home, especially if I was not there to host.", "Soft YTA. I don't think you realize how stressful it can be to have people over last minute", "Look, every relationship is unique and what is okay and not is decided by your mutual communication, but personally I think it\u2019s ridiculous for someone to be against their partner bringing close family to their house when they won\u2019t even be there, even with short notice. I personally could not be in a relationship with someone so unable to be spontaneous or simply just relaxed enough for something small like a lunch with family. You are getting a lot of Y T A; this is not the normal view, this is the view from introverted, people-unfriendly redditors. It is COMPLETELY NORMAL to plan a lunch in your own home when your partner won\u2019t even be at home!\n\nAs I said however, if doing that is something your girlfriend can\u2019t accept, and she has communicated it before, you would be the asshole. It is, though, entirely reasonable for you to say \u201cI expect to be able to bring my family to my house, even spontaneously (but of course within reason)\u201d, and if she doesn\u2019t accept that then maybe you two aren\u2019t a great fit.\n\nNTA, but this is more a communication problem and wether your values fit together.

My husband would have people over when the house looks like we've all had the flu for a week. It literally would not occur to him to be bothered."]}
