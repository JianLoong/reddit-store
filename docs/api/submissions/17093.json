It might\u2019ve been that with the last minute notice she didn\u2019t feel like she had been given the time to clean or whatever else.\n\nIt could also just be that she feels the need to be informed or asked before people come into your shared space.", "Yta, you live together and planned a whole event with your family. Don't you think she would want to be a part  of that with you?", "Soft YTA because you never ever ever invite people over without discussing with the other resident first. \n\nIf ANYONE makes ANY negative comment about your house stop them cold. Do Not permit your family to diss your wife about ANYTHING in the house. Not the cleanliness, not the decor, NOTHING.  Stand up for her if anyone tries to get negative.", "YTA this should have been a conversation that the two of you should go have had before any plans were made", "You aren't wrong for having your family over. Seems like a easy enough thing to accommodate.\n\nYTA for not communicating with her.\n\nWhat if she had changed plans without talking to you and had also made plan to have her mom over at the house suddenly. Or what if she wasn't planning on cleaning before that. What if she was planning on coming home right after her plans, and just having a relaxing day. But mostly, she probably just wants a say in what happens in her own home.", "YTA.  I am obsessed with the perpetual disarray that is MY HOUSE already, and am pissed off on a nuclear level when guests arrive without proper warning.  Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014 I can knock out 6 hours worth of cleaning on 2 hours notice but I *shouldn\u2019t have to, and neither should SHE*.   \n\nPart of this is due to half-assed cleaning because my job demands more hours than I agreed to but, but still love so I don\u2019t care about the hours (we prioritize and keep it clean where it COUNTS), a 14 year old geriatric asshole dog who has to be drugged 7 ways to Sunday in order to be groomed on even the most basic level (we have given up, she has mere months left, we will do the deep clean later).  \n\nBut you do NOT just spring that on someone and dismiss their worries at the last minute.  YTA.", "It is last minute, I definitely understand that part. \n\nLittle sisters boyfriend is a fire fighter and he doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019ll be allowed to take off tomorrow until like 2.5 hours ago when the chief said it\u2019s okay.", "Thank you for a reasonable rationale take. \n\nI think you\u2019re right. \n\nI am the asshole, but didn\u2019t mean to be.", "I have a great yard designed for hosting. \n\nThe plan is to be outside and little clean up besides putting things in my dumpster. \n\nShe is a hyper organized and I think the fact of not knowing stressed her out more than them being here. \n\nI think I\u2019ll take the L and admit I\u2019m the a hole.", "According to her she has to clean. \n\nI\u2019ve assured her it\u2019s fine. We keep our house pretty tidy.", "killa rhymes from the dicecoldkilla, incredible", "You don\u2019t offer to host without talking to the other adults who live there being impacted by your hosting. That\u2019s just common courtesy. YTA", "I'm not going to say you are in the wrong, but if you're inviting more than 1 person over for an \"event\" and it's happening at your house, she needs to be involved in the discussion. You're making excuses about your sister's boyfriend instead of acknowledging the fact that the second it crossed your mind that you wanted to invite people over before you invited a SINGLE person you should have discussed it with your girlfriend first.", "Its stressful for her cause she has to get dress and ready to meet her family.... it will look bad on her part your family coming and she leaving then your  family will see that as rude...\nMaybe next time give a heads up....", "Okay? I didn\u2019t know her firefighter boyfriend also lived in the same space as you and your gf", "It's part of the learning curve when moving in with some one. I've been married for nearly 15 years and both my husband and I have made many little mistakes like that \ud83d\ude02. My husband used to make a sorry i was an AH night in pamper box when he mafe silly mistakes, it always worked. You just get a box and fill it with all her favourite snacks, favourite chocolate, favourite crisps, sweets, a few small cheap but thoughtful gifts eg a new nail polish colour if she does her nails, a new blanket if she likes blankets ect, a candle if she likes candles (gifts under \u00a35 nothing fancy but to show you really know her by filling it with stuff she likes) hopefully it'll work for you too.", "My husbands idea of \u201cthe house looks fine\u201d and mine are very different. This could be playing a factor too even if you arent aware of it.", "If she's newly moved in she might be a little hurt too that you didn't dicuss it first, it's her home too now and she just wants to feel maybe like she has a say in what happens in it.

Although it's sexist, if the place isn't clean and neat, GF is the one they'll think isn't doing her \"job.\"  And, it's probably ingrained in her that when people visit, the place must look presentable or gi l they will think poorly of her.", "YTA.\n\nIf you aren't willing to clean for company,  then you're putting it on her,  and that's why she's stressed. \n\nWhether you think it needs it or not.  It's probably MORE stressful for her BECAUSE you don't think it needs cleaning,  so even if you do manage to stir yourself enough to do something,  it won't be to the standards she wants people to see her home in. \n\nHonestly,  the fact that she immediately got stressed tells me she already knows you're going to bare minimum this and she'll likely have both pre and post cleaning to deal with. \n\nUnless you're telling us your gf is irrational and has no basis in history for her reaction? Because ppl don't get stressed for no reason.", "And will all of those people still be there when she gets home?", "There is clean and there is guest clean.  You have to remember that while you are okay not presenting an immaculate house because it is your family, she likely still feels like she needs to impress them.", "With Chopin as his hype-man.", "Almost certainly no. \n\nMy brother has two small children and will stick around for maybe 2 hours at most. \n\nAround that time my lil sis will probably be leaving as well.", "i mean atleast your not doubling down good for you", "I'll have to render a NAH. Just a little miscommunication.", "Yeah I just wanted second opinions. \n\nAnd for context we\u2019ve been together over a decade. Marriage isn\u2019t something we are interested in but we\u2019re committed. \n\nMy family loves her and she loves my family. \n\nIt\u2019s the stress of not knowing that got to her. \n\nShe\u2019s got a group chat with my two sisters. It\u2019s not an issue of my family being here and she doesn\u2019t want them to be or something. Like I said my fam loves her and she loves them.", "so now you know atleast next time something like this happens. \n\ntrust me there have been people here with the same problems who just throw fits glad you arent."]}
