{"id": 5863, "submission_id": "zxdyxr", "title": "AITA for not spending this Christmas in the hospital with my daughter?", "selftext": "My (39F) daughter (16F) has had a sensitive stomach ever since she was a kid. There are certain foods that will upset her stomach to the point where she's unable to stop throwing up.\n\nWe've seen countless doctors, but so far nobody's been able to give us a clear answer. The only advice we keep getting is to identify all trigger foods and cut them from her diet. We have a pretty good idea of what those foods are: soda and other carbonated drinks, chips, cheetos, and other similar processed snacks, anything oily or fried and most sweets. Unfortunately, this is exacty the kind of stuff my daughter loves to eat the most. And as horrible as she feels after she has them, she still refuses to cut them out of her diet, which in turn led to her spending a lot of time in the hospital during the past few years.\n\nWhen she was little, it was easier to keep all these foods away from her because I simply wouldn't buy them. But now that she's older, I can't always be there to check what she eats. She eats the greasy pizza at her school's cafeteria, she trades her lunch with her classmates, she goes out with her friends and stops to eat at KFC and so on. And it always ends with her in the ER, crying and shaking because she can't stop throwing up.\n\nThis was the case on this Christmas eve as well, when our whole family gathered at our place. And of course, among the many dishes at our Christmas table were some of her main trigger foods, like chips, soda, chocolate and sweets. Now mind you, these were far from the only foods available to her. We also had a variety of home-cooked, traditional dishes on the table, with ingredients that don't upset her stomach, like vegetables, meat, dairy etc. All of them delicious and well-seasoned - my daughter herself says she really likes most of these dishes.\u00a0\n\nDespite this, my daughter chose to eat nothing but her trigger foods. I reminded her that they'd make her feel awful, but she said she didn't care, because *Christmas is only once a year* and she *just wants to live a little*. Well, this ended with her violently throwing up in the ER a few hours later. She had to be hospitalized for a few days and only just got out of the hospital a few hours ago.\n\nAnd unlike all the previous times when something like this happened, this time I chose to spend my Christmas relaxing at home with the rest of our family, and not in the hospital by my daughter's side. I kept in touch with her through calls and texts, and told her that if she needed anything I'd ask a family member to bring it to her, but I made it clear that I would not be visiting her during her stay.\n\nAnd well, my daughter didn't take this too well. She cried every time we talked on the phone, begged me to come over, told me how horrible I was for 'abandoning' her there all alone and so on. Most of our family didn't take my side in this either, and during the past few days I got called everything from 'a little extreme' to downright cruel and heartless.

Do you have your daughter in therapy to help her manage her impulse control?", "She\u2019s 16, old enough to self regulate her diet if it causes her severe issues.

Your daughter is old enough to know what the effects of her actions are and old enough to take responsibility for them. By your description, it isn\u2019t like this is a one-off happening either, with her doing this after outings with friends. If this were the only time in the year, I think my answer might have been different, but she hasn\u2019t exactly been the model of restraint or discipline during the year.

At her age she should be well aware of the way her actions affect others, including her parents, and she clearly either doesn't see this or, worse, knows and doesn't care/wants everyone to share in her misery.\n\nI think what you did falls under the heading of tough love: you gave her a much-needed wake-up call.

And humans are really bad at figuring out why/how/who negative feelings are coming from and blame the wrong thing/people constantly.\n\nThen, there is the whole \"she did it to herself\".  yes, but more complex.  There might also be an element pr pattern of attention seeking as well It happens even with chronically ill and/or medically complex kids, in a way that she or the parents can't really verbalize.  Then there is self-sabotage, or a unconscious mindset of \"if I can't eat x,y,z, then why bother with anything?\"\n\nIf the 16yr old isn't already in therapy, it is beyond time to do so.

And how often is she eating them to the point of needing to be hospitalized? Are you somewhere with universal healthcare, or are you in America?\n\nI'm leaning towards ESH, and everyone needs therapy. At minimum, your daughter needs therapy. Like, a weekly session at least, with someone who specializes in self-harm/eating disorders. Relationships with food can be extremely complex even without a medical condition complicating things.

I hope she gets the college roommate who comes home really drunk, is horribly hung over the next morning, and expects your daughter to wait on her hand and foot. Bring her water, bring her a bucket so she can rinse out her mouth and spit, close the curtains, tell the neighboring dorm room to turn down the  noise, get her the aspirin, etc. etc. etc. so she gets an idea of how NO ONE likes dealing with the damage someone did themselves, absolutely deliberately.", "NAH. To be honest, if she has completely disregarded her medical advice to the point you are taking her to the ER all the time she should know the drill. I can see why she would want you there, and I can see how on your side you are teaching that her actions have consequences. You are human too, and on top of the thankless work of a mother, it seems like you can\u2019t even enjoy Christmas. I would apologize about your actions but also drive home the point that she can\u2019t be doing this. You can\u2019t be expected to drop everything because she can\u2019t stay away from Cheetos or pizza. She is almost at the age where she will be going off to college. What are you suppose to do then?", "I really can\u2019t decide on this on. One the one hand she is your kid and you should be just telling her no and getting her more support because what\u2019s going on isn\u2019t working clearly.

I mean I think the right choice would have been to skip a Christmas Eve meal filled with triggers, but I can understand why that might be hard. \n\nShe is 16 she should know better. \n\nShe is 16 you should visit her in the hospital. \n\nI think you need even more doctors tbh this is inpatient treatment territory to me", "It sounds like she has an eating disorder and should be getting help", " NTA \n\nOf course she is upset - she also will think twice before she does something like this again.", "NTA. It sounds pretty serious. If my diabetic baby cousins can handle not eating candy and sodas, your daughter should be able to. She knew the consequences. Yes, it sucks. No, that doesn't mean you should have to endure the consequences too.

Maybe now you not cuddling her she will stop this behavior.  She knew the consequences when she did it.", "NTA. Your daughter is 16, she knows exactly what she's doing. To herself and to the rest of her immediate family. If the extreme discomfort of her condition won't inspire healthy behavior, perhaps being alone and missing out will. You won't be there forever to hold her hand in the hospital, and she will exhaust the patience of every friend and SO with this behavior. This is her future if she continues, and I don't think it's healthy to continue to shield her from it.\n\nI would recommend getting her some therapy, and include at least a few sessions of family therapy in there as well. She needs to work through why she feels compelled to make herself sick, and what this behavior is doing to her relationships with her family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But those trigger foods- or the amounts we eat them in- also result in bad heartburn or maybe needing a clear path to the bathroom for a few hours the next day. \n\nIf your daughter had like 2 cookies and this happened, I would say show some sympathy. But she really went for it and expects you to deal with her choices by missing out on Christmas to sit next to her for something you know is treatable and she will be fine. \n\nAt some point, she has to learn that the world will not stop for her to go to the hospital/be very sick by making bad food choices. Her professors, her friends, her roommates, and/or her employers will not give her endless grace to need to be out sick/miss assignments/need to be cared for. \n\nSo now the important thing is to stick with and finish the lesson. Be very clear with her that you feel bad that she was in the hospital alone, but you had to make sure she understands the consequences of her actions. If she controlled her diet and cravings, you would/will always be there when something goes wrong, but if she is going to ignore her health limitations, she is going to have to be fully responsible for the consequences.

I think though, even with both choices, she is old enough to accept the consequences and with time she'll understand more that there is no food that is better than listening to your body, feeling good, and enjoying a nice evening with family.

When enough time as gone by and, if they've figured out their shit, the well starts to fill back up.\n\nI have had many people in my life who have not only pumped their wells dry, they've also filled them with concrete.

Also, you cant just \"have them in therapy\" that is literally not at all how therapy works. You don't force anyone to just go to therapy.

That means there is a shortage of nurses, doctors, technicians, CNA's, Health Care Assistants, janitors, domestics, people who basically keep the hospital going. There are a lot of strikes going on. It's likely once daughter was in a room she was left there with minimal interactions once an hour for observations and fluids because they don't HAVE the staff to keep someone comforting her and chatting with her to keep her calm. \n\nI understand OP not wanting to go to hospital over Christmas but jeez. And tbh, I GET daughter should have self-control to avoid these foods and be more responsible for her health, but why not just remove them from the table entirely? I just...I dunno, it's just bad all around.", "How do parents keep kids from doing anything they shouldn't do but want to do? Yes, you ground them if that's necessary.

Cheese (especially melting cheese like mozzarella) seems to be one of the hardest to replicate with an alternative for the flavor profile and texture. I have had some pretty decent cream cheese/dip alternatives but a lot of them have a lot of vegetable oils which obviously are not low fat. It is a bummer that usually making lasagna is a pretty large amount of food to risk making something you if you might not be able to eat the rest.
