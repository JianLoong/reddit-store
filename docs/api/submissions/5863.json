{"id": 5863, "submission_id": "zxdyxr", "title": "AITA for not spending this Christmas in the hospital with my daughter?", "selftext": "My (39F) daughter (16F) has had a sensitive stomach ever since she was a kid. There are certain foods that will upset her stomach to the point where she's unable to stop throwing up.\n\nWe've seen countless doctors, but so far nobody's been able to give us a clear answer. The only advice we keep getting is to identify all trigger foods and cut them from her diet. We have a pretty good idea of what those foods are: soda and other carbonated drinks, chips, cheetos, and other similar processed snacks, anything oily or fried and most sweets. Unfortunately, this is exacty the kind of stuff my daughter loves to eat the most. And as horrible as she feels after she has them, she still refuses to cut them out of her diet, which in turn led to her spending a lot of time in the hospital during the past few years.\n\nWhen she was little, it was easier to keep all these foods away from her because I simply wouldn't buy them. But now that she's older, I can't always be there to check what she eats. She eats the greasy pizza at her school's cafeteria, she trades her lunch with her classmates, she goes out with her friends and stops to eat at KFC and so on. And it always ends with her in the ER, crying and shaking because she can't stop throwing up.\n\nThis was the case on this Christmas eve as well, when our whole family gathered at our place. And of course, among the many dishes at our Christmas table were some of her main trigger foods, like chips, soda, chocolate and sweets. Now mind you, these were far from the only foods available to her. We also had a variety of home-cooked, traditional dishes on the table, with ingredients that don't upset her stomach, like vegetables, meat, dairy etc. All of them delicious and well-seasoned - my daughter herself says she really likes most of these dishes.\u00a0\n\nDespite this, my daughter chose to eat nothing but her trigger foods. I reminded her that they'd make her feel awful, but she said she didn't care, because *Christmas is only once a year* and she *just wants to live a little*. Well, this ended with her violently throwing up in the ER a few hours later. She had to be hospitalized for a few days and only just got out of the hospital a few hours ago.\n\nAnd unlike all the previous times when something like this happened, this time I chose to spend my Christmas relaxing at home with the rest of our family, and not in the hospital by my daughter's side. I kept in touch with her through calls and texts, and told her that if she needed anything I'd ask a family member to bring it to her, but I made it clear that I would not be visiting her during her stay.\n\nAnd well, my daughter didn't take this too well. She cried every time we talked on the phone, begged me to come over, told me how horrible I was for 'abandoning' her there all alone and so on. Most of our family didn't take my side in this either, and during the past few days I got called everything from 'a little extreme' to downright cruel and heartless.

Do you have your daughter in therapy to help her manage her impulse control?", "She\u2019s 16, old enough to self regulate her diet if it causes her severe issues.

Your daughter is old enough to know what the effects of her actions are and old enough to take responsibility for them. By your description, it isn\u2019t like this is a one-off happening either, with her doing this after outings with friends. If this were the only time in the year, I think my answer might have been different, but she hasn\u2019t exactly been the model of restraint or discipline during the year.

At her age she should be well aware of the way her actions affect others, including her parents, and she clearly either doesn't see this or, worse, knows and doesn't care/wants everyone to share in her misery.\n\nI think what you did falls under the heading of tough love: you gave her a much-needed wake-up call.

And humans are really bad at figuring out why/how/who negative feelings are coming from and blame the wrong thing/people constantly.\n\nThen, there is the whole \"she did it to herself\".  yes, but more complex.  There might also be an element pr pattern of attention seeking as well It happens even with chronically ill and/or medically complex kids, in a way that she or the parents can't really verbalize.  Then there is self-sabotage, or a unconscious mindset of \"if I can't eat x,y,z, then why bother with anything?\"\n\nIf the 16yr old isn't already in therapy, it is beyond time to do so.

And how often is she eating them to the point of needing to be hospitalized? Are you somewhere with universal healthcare, or are you in America?\n\nI'm leaning towards ESH, and everyone needs therapy. At minimum, your daughter needs therapy. Like, a weekly session at least, with someone who specializes in self-harm/eating disorders. Relationships with food can be extremely complex even without a medical condition complicating things.

I hope she gets the college roommate who comes home really drunk, is horribly hung over the next morning, and expects your daughter to wait on her hand and foot. Bring her water, bring her a bucket so she can rinse out her mouth and spit, close the curtains, tell the neighboring dorm room to turn down the  noise, get her the aspirin, etc. etc. etc. so she gets an idea of how NO ONE likes dealing with the damage someone did themselves, absolutely deliberately.", "NAH. To be honest, if she has completely disregarded her medical advice to the point you are taking her to the ER all the time she should know the drill. I can see why she would want you there, and I can see how on your side you are teaching that her actions have consequences. You are human too, and on top of the thankless work of a mother, it seems like you can\u2019t even enjoy Christmas. I would apologize about your actions but also drive home the point that she can\u2019t be doing this. You can\u2019t be expected to drop everything because she can\u2019t stay away from Cheetos or pizza. She is almost at the age where she will be going off to college. What are you suppose to do then?", "I really can\u2019t decide on this on. One the one hand she is your kid and you should be just telling her no and getting her more support because what\u2019s going on isn\u2019t working clearly.

I mean I think the right choice would have been to skip a Christmas Eve meal filled with triggers, but I can understand why that might be hard. \n\nShe is 16 she should know better. \n\nShe is 16 you should visit her in the hospital. \n\nI think you need even more doctors tbh this is inpatient treatment territory to me", "It sounds like she has an eating disorder and should be getting help", " NTA \n\nOf course she is upset - she also will think twice before she does something like this again.", "NTA. It sounds pretty serious. If my diabetic baby cousins can handle not eating candy and sodas, your daughter should be able to. She knew the consequences. Yes, it sucks. No, that doesn't mean you should have to endure the consequences too.

Maybe now you not cuddling her she will stop this behavior.  She knew the consequences when she did it.", "NTA. Your daughter is 16, she knows exactly what she's doing. To herself and to the rest of her immediate family. If the extreme discomfort of her condition won't inspire healthy behavior, perhaps being alone and missing out will. You won't be there forever to hold her hand in the hospital, and she will exhaust the patience of every friend and SO with this behavior. This is her future if she continues, and I don't think it's healthy to continue to shield her from it.\n\nI would recommend getting her some therapy, and include at least a few sessions of family therapy in there as well. She needs to work through why she feels compelled to make herself sick, and what this behavior is doing to her relationships with her family.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

But those trigger foods- or the amounts we eat them in- also result in bad heartburn or maybe needing a clear path to the bathroom for a few hours the next day. \n\nIf your daughter had like 2 cookies and this happened, I would say show some sympathy. But she really went for it and expects you to deal with her choices by missing out on Christmas to sit next to her for something you know is treatable and she will be fine. \n\nAt some point, she has to learn that the world will not stop for her to go to the hospital/be very sick by making bad food choices. Her professors, her friends, her roommates, and/or her employers will not give her endless grace to need to be out sick/miss assignments/need to be cared for. \n\nSo now the important thing is to stick with and finish the lesson. Be very clear with her that you feel bad that she was in the hospital alone, but you had to make sure she understands the consequences of her actions. If she controlled her diet and cravings, you would/will always be there when something goes wrong, but if she is going to ignore her health limitations, she is going to have to be fully responsible for the consequences.

I think though, even with both choices, she is old enough to accept the consequences and with time she'll understand more that there is no food that is better than listening to your body, feeling good, and enjoying a nice evening with family.

Trigger foods could be an issue, but it could also be leading you in the wrong direction and leading you to false conclusions.  After seeing specialists for years, we finial received a diagnosis of Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome. This is a rare disease and even the gastroenterologist my daughter was seeing didn't know about it, let alone the dozens of ER docs at the hospital.

The liver is responsible for making the bile. The gallbladder's role is to store and concentrate the bile that the liver makes. The liver doesn't make concentrated bile, the gallbladder concentrates it. So when you eat a meal, especially a fatty meal, the gallbladder contracts and releases the stored bile. Bile is what breaks down those fats. If you have cholecystitis (inflammation of the GB) or cholelithiasis (gallstones), it hurts when the GB contracts.  So one will often get their gallbladder removed. And you can do fine without a gallbladder. The liver just steps up and makes bile when needed. However, if you have a high fat meal, there is only so much bile the liver can make a said time, so a lot of the fat is not digested. Undigested fat has to go somewhere and out the other end it goes. Diarrhea is common in people without a gallbladder when they eat a fatty meal.  Most do fine without a gallbladder but you do have to be more careful with high fat meals.", "Not gross, at least to me anyway no worries", "This is no how it was explained to me. I had mine out less than two years ago.\n\n\nMy understanding (as explained by my surgeon) is that the liver produces a steady drip of bile, and the gallbladder is where it's collected. The bile duct from our liver connects to the start of our small intestine and the gallbladder is an offshoot of the same tube. It doesn't go into your stomach.\n\n\nWhen we eat high fat foods our gallbladder excreted a large amount of bile to break down the fats for easier digestion. However, this mechanism is a layover from our hunter gatherer days when we would often go for long periods of time eating only plants and then when we had meat we would have a lot of it so our digestive system needed a helping hand to break down the fats and proteins.\n\n\nWhen you have your gallbladder removed, you no longer have that backup mechanism to assist the digestion of fatty meals so they are less comfortable to digest, but you can still digest them. (For me this was stomach ache and slow stomach emptying rather than the runs, but that can also be caused by rich fatty foods, it's to donwith the fats though not the bile). And you also have the steady drip of bile into your digestive system which isn't all getting used up in digestion which means more bile reaches your anus undigested and can lead to smellier poops and farts.\n\n\nI was only 28 getting my gallbladder out and I know age plays a role but I am able to eat anything I like and only had to eat a low fat diet for 10 days post op before reintroducing full fat dairy and things. If I ate a full pizza it was uncomfortable for maybe a year afterwards, but now I can eat totally normally.", "Oh, yup. That is a not-fun side effect of gall bladder removal. I feel you.

She\u2019s not trying to exact revenge on anyone, or ruin their holiday. She\u2019s trying to be a normal teenager, no matter how short that lasts before she pays the consequences.\n\nFor a bit more perspective\u2026even as an adult it sucks to have yummy food in front of you that you can\u2019t eat, and way more so as a kid. She\u2019s probably feeling left out and frustrated \u2014 if not outright angry \u2014 that she can\u2019t partake and that she\u2019ll have to deal with this for the rest of her life. It\u2019s probably a mix of teenage acting out and rebellion, nihilism that she\u2019s going to have to deal with this forever, and self-harm/ED as a way of processing how she\u2019s feeling. Also \u2014 if mom (rightly) restricted her diet as a child, this is also probably partly a freedom binge; it\u2019s common with kids whose parents strictly managed their food for any reason. They see what they can\u2019t have and they want it all, like every other teenager with every other vice. \n\nAt least, that\u2019s how it was for me. I went through my non-compliant phase several years after this girl \u2014 I was a little bit older and it all still sucked. Having my mom leave me when I was already struggling so much would\u2019ve been awful. What she needs is more support, not being told to grow up and figure it out.

I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and say she\u2019s probably also depressed since she does this to herself constantly. \n\nThere\u2019s probably some aspect of unfairness to her mindset; it\u2019s unfair that she can\u2019t do things that other kids her age can. So she does them anyway, and deals with the consequences later. It\u2019s very alienating when you\u2019re a kid with chronic health problems. Most adults have something wrong, and can somewhat relate to others their age. But kids mostly don\u2019t have these sorts of health problems.

Seventh grade was also an *extremely* stressful time in my life, so it\u2019s never been as bad as it was then. But I felt absolutely miserable. I kept track of all the food I ate, when I slept, what fabrics I even wore, when I was sick and what the pain felt like - my doctor couldn\u2019t figure it out. An allergy test came back negative. My doctor congratulated me on losing weight (because I was sick so much). Eventually, I switched schools, a lot of the stuff that made my life highly stressful changed, and my stomach got better. But it\u2019s been twenty years, and I still get an upset stomach out of nowhere sometimes, and that period in my life lead to significant mental health issues I\u2019m still learning to cope with today.\n\nI sympathize a lot with the daughter in this situation, obviously.

Lactose intolerant people who get horrific diarrhea and pain will still eat stuff with lactose.", "There are expenses besides the actual hospital visit - missed work, takeout if eating at the hospital, parking, etc. It adds up quickly even if you don\u2019t need to pay out of pocket for the actual health care.", "Even if not in the US, there are fees associated with this kind of ongoing visitation. It may not be medical bills, but Gas costs for having to constantly drive back and forth from the hospital, costs to make up missed education (like tutoring), missed work, etc. \n\nRegardless of where you live, that adds up FAST especially if you\u2019re lower income. Missed work means missed income, and every other expense just becomes that much more of a burden", "It's interesting that you have an eating disorder, and you see signs that she has an eating disorder. I'm an alcoholic, and I see signs that she has an addiction. I guess we all see things through our own lenses.

It sucks, but it\u2019s a reality that she *needs* to get serious about, or she will cause permanent damage to herself, if she hasn\u2019t already.", "She's \"sick\" in the sense that someone with alcohol poisoning is sick.  It does suck that eating a bag of Cheetos gives her the same raging nausea that most of us only get from a fifth of rum, but she knowingly did this to herself.\n\nNo I did not expect my mother to comfort me when, at 16, I drank Long Island iced tea until I puked.  \n\nThere are a lot of people in this thread who have dealt with food allergies, self-harm, and relatives with psychological issues around medical care.  This kid is costing her family a lot, emotionally and financially.  She needs support to change her behavior, not sympathy for the consequences.", "I\u2019m an adult and still wanted my mom with me in the hospital when I had the stomach flu and was dehydrated. \n\nBut I didn\u2019t lick a public door handle to get the stomach flu so I could end up in the hospital. \n\nAnd I have a history of self harm and a severe eating disorder that landed me in the hospital over multiple holidays (including my birthday). Never once expected anyone there with me. In fact I did whatever I could to avoid the attention because I didn\u2019t want to get healthy at the time. \n\nThere is something going on with the daughter and OP put in place a healthy boundary.

She should be investigating that option if the pharmacy is 20 minutes away...", "My goodness, I never realised how much some humans were like our disabled dachshund until now! He was a shy dog who would run away from most people when he had all four legs working. After becoming paralysed in the back legs and spending a month post-surgery at the vet hospital (where he got snacks and massages every two hours, round the clock), he has since become an outgoing menace!! He demands food off our plates, continuous attention and will purposely pretend to fall over if he thinks he\u2019s not being noticed every second. I\u2019m now going to think about these people as wayward dachshunds, it makes it so much funnier when thinking about how to manage their behaviours!\n\n(Ps - my dog is not suffering from anxiety, I promise. He has literally just become a hilariously entitled arsehole. Given that my husband is retired and there\u2019s always someone with him, and he\u2019s a very old dog, we are just letting him run with it. He knows that we know, and he\u2019s milking it for all it\u2019s worth.)", "the trigger foods themselves are honestly very suspicious to me. I have really severe food sensitivities - obviously it doesn't make me an expert on every food related disability but regular home cooked food with meat and dairy doesn't make her sick, but eating KFC does? combined with the fact that doctors don't know what's going on with her... if she's not faking it somehow or purposefully inducing it by some means other than the food, this sounds like there's a strong chance that this is a psychosomatic thing, not an actual food allergy, which doesn't make it any less *real* but which does have a very different way of treatment", "Eating disorder behaviour is addictive - personally from my experience, my ED was 100% an addiction. It\u2019s obsessive, ritualistic, all-consuming and very hard to kick. But once you\u2019re outside it you\u2019re like wtf how did I do that or go to those lengths just to fulfil my eating disorder.\n\nMy cousin for example struggles with bulimia and after she was admitted to hospital my aunt found plastic bags full of vomit hidden under her bed. You do things you couldn\u2019t imagine just to fulfil that need to purge. It\u2019s really similar to the lengths people will go to to fulfil drug and alcohol addiction, no-one seems to ever really talk about that aspect of ED but it\u2019s true. You will go to extremes to do it and hide it.\n\nAnyway absolutely not to disagree with what you\u2019re saying, we absolutely all see stuff from our own experiences and I\u2019m not saying she definitely has an ED. But yeah I would say eating disorders are addictive behaviours so it makes sense you see addiction in the post, they\u2019re part and parcel of the same thing for me.", "You get high off of the routines of an ED. It\u2019s definitely an addiction in some ways. \nSpeaking as someone with experience", "True, but if someone was sick with alcohol poisoning I wouldn\u2019t assume they were \u201cdoing it for attention\u201d or trying to manipulate people. I would assume that they were genuinely sick.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what grinds my gears. People so often look at behaviours from people with mental health issues (especially if they\u2019re young or a woman or both) and immediately discount it as being \u201cfor attention\u201d instead of taking the issue seriously. I don\u2019t think OP\u2019s actions were wrong but I take issues with comments and attitudes like the one above mine.", "This seems like a cry for help. There is clearly something not right with this girl's head, and we are not capable of determining what it is.

I can avoid them and feel fine or eat them and risk losing my gallbladder altogether ( and then still never eat fatty foods again)", "Honestly, I think people downplay 'doing something for attention'. At it's core, doing something for parental attention is about not knowing how to get love and affection in a healthy way.   A massive amount of human behavior boils down to wanting affection/love/care, but culturally there's often an idea that 'doing something for attention' is a minor/unimportant drive", "Even if she's in a country where healthcare is funded through tax, there's a cost. She and her family may not see it, but she's actively costing the health service money by willingly endangering her health.

All I did was watch him, he didn\u2019t need help. He pulled the call light when he was done. He stood up and held his ass cheeks open. I asked why are you doing that? His answer: so you can wipe me. I walked out and left him there.", "Not sure how hospitals there are doing but here in BC, Canada they're collapsing. Ambulances are taking +10 hours to respond and the hospitals themselves are beyond capacity.
