I fully admit that I don\u2019t care for anniversaries but if it was important to my partner, I will absolutely put in the effort for them because of the fact it is important to them.

Yes, the dinner picnic you planned is very nice but you are eating it also, right?  \n\nI\u2019ve been married 40 years and I am fortunate to have a wonderful partner.

You simply want to know because if it was for a reason you want understand and find a way to help. \n\nIf it's not for a reason just explain how it slightly upset you that it looked and felt like he spent no time or thought on it, that you aren't mad or acussing him but that you want to talk about what you can both do in the future to combat this.", "Yta no offense but anymore on etsy a lot of stuff is bootleg, stolen, second hand or also being sold on amazon prime by the same \u201cseller\u201d so it could possibly be the exact same necklace just from prime and not etsy and probably for a way less crazy price than i usually see on etsy for shit", "YTA - So you haven't even seen the gift yet and are jumping to conclusions?

How much you spend does not mean you care more.", "YTA\n\nThis isn't about jewelry. It's about how it's making you feel like he's not trying as hard as you're trying and thinking ahead about you.

I'd focus (not tonight) another night on how this makes you feel and what your like to see going forward", "YTA - Yeah, you're being entitled.\n\nGifts and anniversaries don't carry the same weight for everyone.

Or celebrating the decision to be together?\n\nIf presents are important to you then you need to tell me how important and why. If you will only be happy with very specific presents, then you need to specify.\n\nAlso, expecting jewellery and accusing him of not making an effort when all you've got for him is strawberries ruined with chocolate, cheese ruined with fruit, salami and a bottle of wine, served where he lives is taking the piss. You get something that holds value forever, and he gets a cold meal prepared by someone else? How is that personalised to him in the way you expect hope gift to be personalised to you?", "YTA\n\nYou told him exactly what you wanted, you spent time researching it and even found the place to buy it. Why the hell didn't you just buy it instead of creating the drama? You said birth month he bought birth month, ok not the ones you wanted, but he bought you a present.\n\nAnd exactly how much \"time and effort\" did you put into his gift? You didn't make a thing, you bought it all, and it was a nice gesture, and I'm sure it looked lovely, but please. You didn't spend 8 weeks in a woodshop or something. \n\nI supposed after 3 years people still follow anniversary traditions, but take it from me, after 36 years it's a miracle if we even remember it (and we usually don't. \n\nDon't be petty.

Different people demonstrate love in different ways. There's quality time, acts of service, physical touch, word of affirmation, and gifts. It sounds like gifts are a significant act of love for you, but not for him. \n\nSome people are really bad gift-givers. My husband is one. He thinks gifts are dumb, is really bad at buying them, and feels really uncomfortable when receiving them. For my birthday this year, he paid for a nice date and never gave me a gift because in his mind, paying for the date was the gift. However, he is still a really sweet man and I know he loves me. I just know that I can't expect him to show that love is with gifts. Instead, he'll work for hours making me food or doing chores I don't like to do, and that will be his \"gift\" to me.\n\nIf you feel like your husband is totally neglecting your anniversary, I would tell him how you feel and express that you felt hurt that he didn't seem interested in demonstrating his love to you that day.

He is an \u201cA\u201d. I just think he wasn\u2019t being cheap.

The cake thing *and* the part where you had to plan everything yourself, all I ever really want for my birthday is 1 day getting to shut my brain off and not make any decisions.

I don't even wear that much jewelry and my husband has still been able to figure out what types of pieces I like all on his own. He's gotten me some really pretty 'serious' pieces, and also some joke pieces that I still loved and found quite funny. Mostly pendants and earrings. He stays away from rings because he knows I'm rather picky about those and he would rather me pick those out and leave no room for error.", "I just cancelled my prime account a couple months ago and every item I've ordered from Amazon still comes in a box labeled prime, whether it arrives in 2 days or 20. Never thought about this before now, but why would they even make boxes that don't say prime? 1. It's free advertising, 2.

That adds up, fast.  I definitely get way over $250 in \u201cfree\u201d shipping over year.  Usually a lot more\u2026\n\nExcept for some home brewing kit and supplies, everything I\u2019ve ordered in the last few years came in a \u201cPrime\u201d shipping package.

Perhaps for HER, she likes MATERIAL items for gifts whereas he doesn\u2019t near as much. I know I do because I love collecting knick-knacks. My boyfriend knows this, so he always suggests we go antiquing. And occasionally he finds something he wants to buy. \n\nI enjoy gift-giving, but my boyfriend has also expressed while he appreciates the material items I\u2019ve given him in the past, he wants something that has more utility that he normally wouldn\u2019t bother buying himself.  \n\nBoth gifts are comparable to what they each value as a love language. What is not comparable between them here is the effort put in. \n\nIf the gift was a pair of concert tickets for the both of them, would you be giving her the same shit?
