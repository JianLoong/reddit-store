I fully admit that I don\u2019t care for anniversaries but if it was important to my partner, I will absolutely put in the effort for them because of the fact it is important to them.

Yes, the dinner picnic you planned is very nice but you are eating it also, right?  \n\nI\u2019ve been married 40 years and I am fortunate to have a wonderful partner.

Or celebrating the decision to be together?\n\nIf presents are important to you then you need to tell me how important and why. If you will only be happy with very specific presents, then you need to specify.\n\nAlso, expecting jewellery and accusing him of not making an effort when all you've got for him is strawberries ruined with chocolate, cheese ruined with fruit, salami and a bottle of wine, served where he lives is taking the piss. You get something that holds value forever, and he gets a cold meal prepared by someone else? How is that personalised to him in the way you expect hope gift to be personalised to you?", "YTA\n\nYou told him exactly what you wanted, you spent time researching it and even found the place to buy it. Why the hell didn't you just buy it instead of creating the drama? You said birth month he bought birth month, ok not the ones you wanted, but he bought you a present.\n\nAnd exactly how much \"time and effort\" did you put into his gift? You didn't make a thing, you bought it all, and it was a nice gesture, and I'm sure it looked lovely, but please. You didn't spend 8 weeks in a woodshop or something. \n\nI supposed after 3 years people still follow anniversary traditions, but take it from me, after 36 years it's a miracle if we even remember it (and we usually don't. \n\nDon't be petty.

Different people demonstrate love in different ways. There's quality time, acts of service, physical touch, word of affirmation, and gifts. It sounds like gifts are a significant act of love for you, but not for him. \n\nSome people are really bad gift-givers. My husband is one. He thinks gifts are dumb, is really bad at buying them, and feels really uncomfortable when receiving them. For my birthday this year, he paid for a nice date and never gave me a gift because in his mind, paying for the date was the gift. However, he is still a really sweet man and I know he loves me. I just know that I can't expect him to show that love is with gifts. Instead, he'll work for hours making me food or doing chores I don't like to do, and that will be his \"gift\" to me.\n\nIf you feel like your husband is totally neglecting your anniversary, I would tell him how you feel and express that you felt hurt that he didn't seem interested in demonstrating his love to you that day.
