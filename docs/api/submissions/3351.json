You have information now that you didn\u2019t then and the decision to not combine finances immediately is not only a self preservation process but also a decision that protects your mental and financial wellbeing and in turn the health of your future marriage.\n\nI would absolutely recommend that you speak with an attorney. I would also recommend being totally transparent with her about it and maybe offering to help her with getting her finances under control and counseling her on debt management and living within her means. \n\nShe\u2019s probably taking this as an attack. That\u2019s the best intentions assumption. Worst case is that she was hoping to merge finances and debt burden and benefit from your fiscal responsibility to alleviate her debt. I wouldn\u2019t suggest assuming that necessarily but I think your instincts are correct that you should proceed cautiously until she\u2019s proven she can act responsibly with the money she expects to share (and spend) with you.", "NTA, and get a prenup.", "NTA. The car note isn't necessarily concerning if she has a job and is able to pay that off, but $50k in credit card debt is absolutely bonkers. I wouldn't marry her until that was fully paid off. \n\nYou definitely need both a prenup and she needs to speak to a financial advisor and budget planner.", "NTA.  But realize, your relationship is probably over.  I'm not saying you should do it (you shouldn't), but there is no way this ends well.\n\nEven *if* you helped her get past the current situation - this is the lifestyle she lives.  She's not going to change.  If anything, once her debt goes away - it will only get worse.  As compatible as you think you are, you really aren't.", "NTA. You agreed to sharing a life, not her debt. That's her responsibility and hers alone.\nShould you both decide to go through with the wedding then you need to protect yourself and your assets, while laying down hard boundaries with your money.", "NTA. I'm sure if you had this information when you were all discussing merging your finances you would have never agreed.", "NTA\n\nYou guys may want to invest in some marriage counseling and really talk through junk. Tina clearly has a spending problem and if you two don\u2019t get ahead of that it is going to lead to bitterness that will eventually turn into a divorce.\n\nI had 70k in school loans when we got married. Debt isn\u2019t terrible but the inability to get out of it or change habits will cause a lot of friction.\n\nYou really don\u2019t want to move forward without a good plan.", "NTA. But this is so much bigger than what a pre-nup or splitting finances can fix. You two are highly incompatible and this relationship is on its way to ending. Having similar financial habits is fundamental to every relationship. This is a deal breaker. You should have known this years ago.\n\nEven if she sells the car, buckles down and gets that debt taken care of, her behavior means you will always be carrying the financial burden. Even with separate finances, married couples function as a financial unit. You will be footing the bill for major expenses and indirectly supporting her. Come retirement time, if your investments are significantly greater, you will just end up supporting her then too. Like it or not, marriage means your lifestyle and net wealth are forever tied to that other person, for better or worse.\n\nDifferent jurisdictions have different laws (talk to the lawyer).   But it is very difficult to isolate yourself from the other person's bad financial habits. Plus, if one is a saver and has more, the other becomes dependent on them and your relationship takes on this weird power dynamic.", "NTA. She must have known the position she was in, and chose not to share that info - even in a general \"I have a decent chunk of debt I'm paying off\" sense - when first discussing future financials. I get being embarrassed and avoiding, but it's unreasonable to hold someone to a plan they made while you withheld key information.\n\nIf nothing else, surely it's sensible to have one of you with good credit and/or investments insulated from that debt in case you guys need it, rather than fully merging so utilisation is maxed out and investments are at risk. She needs to get a plan under her for clearing this, and expecting you to help when she hasn't even made a real effort herself is very selfish and short-sighted.", "NTA. The amount of money your fianc\u00e9 owes is a huge burden. She needs a financial advisor. This may help with curbing her spending money she doesn\u2019t have. Maybe once she realizes how long it will take to pay off her debts, she\u2019ll change her spending habits. You have every right to be concerned with your future finances. Hope everything works out for the both of you. Good luck !", "Get the prenup. It it can cover assets and debts. CYA. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know she was in that much debt when you agreed and taking it on is crazy.\n\nPlus I don\u2019t think merging finances is ever a really good idea.", "Nta pre nup", "NTA. Never mingle finances. Looks like you need a prenuptial agreement, too. You may even reconsider marriage completely until she can show she's financially responsible. You two may not be a good fit because if she's so in debt, she may never do better. Some people just aren't good with money.", "NAH. You two have different approaches to a huge topic in a relationship - money.  This is more about communication and beliefs.\n\nWhat if your soon to be wife never changes as it relates to finances, how would you feel?", "NTA, that's a huge pile of manye she owes and paying off her expensive lifestyle shouldn't be placed on you", "Ah the old bait and switch! You\u2019re NTA but I would guess at least some of her debt was accrued with the mindset that you\u2019ll be helping deal with that in the future. Sorry bud but if you get married, you will look back to this when you\u2019re getting divorced and realize it was over before it even started.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it will end your relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: You ARE an AH for your timing. YOu would have needed to do that BEFORE getting engaged, and BEFORE agreeing to merge finances. You ARE going back on your word - and without anything being changed, you just failed to do your due dilligence before making promises. This is YOUR fault.", "Kindly also remember that you have had 7 years of additional earning potential to build wealth.

I wouldn't take it off the table forever, maybe you can agree to keep things as is for now and then in a couple of years revisit it.

My debt would only bring us both down. He gives me money when I need (SAHM) and he has a credit card for both of us.", "Nta.  I agree with what other have said,  your relationship is on its way to being over.  You are not compatible when your fundamental values are so different.  You live beneath your means and invest in your future.  She lives in the moment, spending everything she has and more.  There is a reason why so many marriages end over money.  It\u2019s a core value you need to be on the same page as your partner.  She is not a 21 year old acting irresponsible with a credit card.  She is 32 years old.  This is who she is.", "NTA \nFinances are a primary issue in relationships.\n\nHave you thought about just having your account and you deal with your preexisting bills, she have her account to deal with her preexisting bills and a joint house account that deals with joint finances? I would also recommend that you both speak to a financial consultant before marriage. Not sure what state or country you are in but I  would hate for you to end up with debt that isn't yours.\n\nWhere I am from pre and post marriage debt can remain seperate; just don't put your name on any of her preexisting accounts or refinances.", "Nah. Your both should have discussed the details before deciding to merge finances. Now it is that you don't want to take on her debt. While that is natural, it's going to feel like you aren't committed. \n\nBut please understand the biggest issue is not what you both have done in the past with money but what you will do in the future. You are a saver. She is a spender. You don't care about appearances. She does. Have you discussed how you are going to merge those styles? For example - what kind of home you want to live in?", "NTA but ultimately you should cut your loss and move on. Marriage is a partnership where you don\u2019t look adoringly at each other but looking toward the same goal and it seems unlikely you guys can come to that agreement. Current finance is just the beginning of the series of big talk you should be having before marriage. Have you discussed children, supporting your and her parents in old age, your own retirement plan and financial goal, contingency for when you are sick/burn out and can\u2019t work. All of these are bare minimum a married couple should agree on. \n\nEven keeping finance separate won\u2019t be the answer. What happened when she can\u2019t pay the bill or her debt? Can you sit by and look at the woman you love stress out? What kind of home life would that create?\n\nPersonally, I find her way of living reckless and unsustainable but this excessive spending on debt could also be a coping mechanism so I don\u2019t want to judge. Your relationship doesn\u2019t have a chance unless she\u2019s willing to change and put real effort into sorting out her finances. Or you decided to hell with saving and contingencies let\u2019s just spend. I doubt you are willing to that.", "NTA\n\nUnless Tina takes on a major lifestyle change here, this situation is not going to get any better.\n\nProblem is, after years or building up a specific image, I doubt she will change.", "NTA. She's living way above her means and you should not be responsible for her debt.", "FOLLOW YOUR GUT! I\u2019ve seen this play out 2 ways, Mostly bad. Usually the partner in debt remains in debt, and with the reduction in bills, spends more. It happens a LOT. If she were working through a debt reduction plan of some sort, (cutting extra spending, reducing ongoing expenses, putting extra money towards paying down debt, etc) then that might be a different story. \n\nIn most states, debts and assets accumulated before the wedding remain the sole responsibility of the person who racked them up. There are some states where if the partner helps pay on the debts, then they can be held liable as well, so talk to a lawyer. \n\nOne option might be to setup a new joint checking account where you both put an agreed amount of money in each month for bills and household items. Then do a gradual joining. Phase 2 is becoming an authorized user on ONE of each others cards (you should each still have 2 cards in your name from different issuers), then later, as she shows how well she\u2019s getting her debt in control, you can look into merging finances completely. But you should each keep your own account for some things, like her paying her debts down. \n\nIf you wouldn\u2019t put the obligation of your debt on to her, then she shouldn\u2019t be willing to put hers on to you. If this is such a problem for her, then you have to consider that you and your fianc\u00e9 have a massive incompatibility that needs to be addressed. She\u2019s a fully grown adult, so these were her choices and her actions that are causing this. If she\u2019s not fixing them, then marring her is going to mean a world of hurt. \n\nNTA", "NTA. That\u2019s a \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. It\u2019s not even student debt. She\u2019s irresponsible with her resources. It is 840", "nta. She blew up because she thought you should want to bail her out. Big red flag.", "NTA That's really shitty and shady that you just found out about this now. My wife's parents wanted her to get a prenup until they found out I was fuckin loaded. I look like a god-damned hobo and I live very frugal, think white trash mountain hillbilly and my picture comes up lolol. We didn't get a prenup but I have money overseas in swiss bank accounts", "NTA.  To be fair, you're not really changing you mind, you're backing out of a decision because you got material information you didn't have at the time the information is made.\n\nNow, she must make a decent income to qualify for a $75k car on her own, despite the existing debt.  How dire is her ability to pay it off?", "NTA.  I would need to see proof (ie long term progress) she can be financial responsible before tying the knot.  Even if the debt magically went away, there will be more until she learns a new lifestyle.", "NTA but the relationship may not survive. Finances are a big thing in relationships and you have to be on the same page even if you keep your finances separate. We didn\u2019t talk finances before getting married but we were teenagers. In your thirties you\u2019ve had your chance to be young and dumb and learn from it. If she is still living above her means then y\u2019all may not be compatible. Will your marriage end up being you covering the big purchases and saving for retirement while she continues to flounder? I only see the relationship working if she is making an effort to turn her finances around and is changing her spending habits.", "NTA.\n\nBetter you realized it now than after you got married. \n\nThing is, you got some additional information that you didn't have before, and therefore you changed your mind.  That is a normal way to handle things. \n\nShe is mad because she was going to go from her debt to \"our\" debt, and you'd have to be responsible for it too. \n\nIf she can't realize this and that its not fair for you to take on her debt, she may not be the one to marry.   Financial things cause divorces all the time.", "ESH\n\n\nYou blindly agreed to do this...and changed your mind. So yeah that makes you an ahole.\n\nAlso complaining about her debt related to a vehicle is also an ahole point. It's an expected debt and you know this. It's the same as complaining about someone have debt due to a mortgage.\n\nHer having 50k on cards is concerning. I get wanting to keep money seperate..but you should have discussed this before in detail before agreeing to anything. Again you promised repeatedly to do this without concern for actually checking her finances first. You acted like a \"big man\" till you saw what was coming and then cried off. I mean you bragged about how you liked her looks and expensive taste.....and you want to keep that without paying for it....what!?!\n\nYou claim she's the one and the live of your life----- but your reaction on here says otherwise. You speak only about yourself and protecting your concerns. Why wouldn't you ask to do financial planning services to prepare yourselves and help her?? And easy compromise of joint expense account and seperate accounts would have been best for you guys.\n\nNow it's like you saw something wrong with your partner and you just screamed \"abandon ship ...everyman for themselves\".... You're whining about her debt... ..and she's probably wondering about your loyalty and lack of spine. Everyone sucks here.", "NTA but unless she\u2019s willing to make serious changes this will be a major issue in your relationship. She\u2019s a spender who likes to live beyond her means. Even if you separate your finances, you will still feel the effects of her irresponsible behavior. If she can\u2019t pay her half of the bills it will fall on you to pick up the slack. Also think long term about retirement. I wouldn\u2019t marry her without a prenup and that debt cut down by at least half.", "Exactly. Also Tina's crafty, in all the conversations about the future & merging finances she never even mentioned in passing or joked about her horrible debt to OP.", "[removed]", "> NTA. The car note isn't necessarily concerning if she has a job and is able to pay that off, but $50k in credit card debt is absolutely bonkers. I wouldn't marry her until that was fully paid off.\n\nSpending 75k on a car when you already have 50k in CC debt absolutely is concerning.", "Yeah, that's not the way it works in reality. Even if she is putting $50,000 of her personal money into her debt, that is $50,000 that is not being invested in the marriage and long term savings. That is $50,000 not available for the house down payment or the surprise shingle job or new deck. That money has to come from somewhere and he will indirectly foot the bill regardless. That $50,000 would have benefited *both* people in the marriage, but instead it is paying down a single person's debt and not accessible to both.\n\nWhat, he is just going to live out his golden years going on cruises and staying at their vacation property, while his wife barely makes ends meet in a shoddy one bedroom apartment?!", "ESH\n\nI agree with you, but Tina is also an AH for not telling OP that she has a decent amount of debt.

But now he has the information and has made a different decision.", "I don't think he is as concerned with the lack of savings as with the amount of debt.  She also had 7 less years to rack up debt and spend within her means, which she chose not to do.", "I feel that there\u2019s a thin line there before that can become financial abuse also. You should have money available to you. SAHM is a full time job and you should be paid for that rather than having to ask permission to spend money. No offense. If it works for you two, it works. It can just be a slippery slope depending on your partner.", "Maybe she was worried about being judged. You know, kind of like you are doing now.", "Actually you\u2019re not a Tina.  Based on info provided by OP, Tina\u2019s debt is comprised of $50k credit cards and $75k new electric car.  Yours are $10k student loans and $4.5k car loan.  Even if Tina sells her electric car and manage to pay off the $75k car loan with proceeds, that still leaves her with $50k credit cards where it is not clear what the spend was for.  Perhaps related to \u201cshe looks amazing, like she just stepped out of a magazine cover\u201d ?  Your student loan was (shall we say) less discretionary - hers appear to be very much discretionary and that is the crucial difference.", "So you're agreeing she hid it purposely from her fiance, just for different reasons than me.", "NTA Trust me I have made this mistake do not combine your finances. I did this in my first marriage and it was a disaster he had debt and unpaid student loans that were never mentioned before we got married. I ended up going back to work when our child was three months old because there were creditors knocking on the door weekly- it was horrible. Trust me this type of spending habits won\u2019t change and you will fight over money until one of you can\u2019t do it anymore. It sounds horrible but you are probably better off with just parting ways now before it gets messy.

DONT MARRY HER...\nShe is such a red flag...", "NTA   It\u2019s a reasonable concern and you need to take it a step farther. If you don\u2019t merge finances, what does that look like?  She has 125k of debt. Will she change her spending habits?  Are you willing to forgo vacations or a nicer home because she can\u2019t pay half?  What will retirement look like?  You don\u2019t want to take on her debt and legally there are probably ways to arrange that. \n\nHowever, you still want to share a life with this woman and she\u2019s showing you who she is. Someone that isn\u2019t particularly bothered by that amount of debt. Someone who wants those flashier things. Are you two financially compatible because one spouse is usually subsidizing the other in the situation directly or indirectly. Are you going to resent her if you have to give up things because of her financial choices?

Don\u2019t let yourself be sidetracked into an argument about going back on your word to merge finances. Simply state you did not have the full picture and now that you do -well, you have concerns that need to be addressed. The concerns are your different approaches to spending and saving.

I'd talk to an expert about a prenuptial just to cover yourself so you don't take it on. Regarding bills - I suggest you do it by percentage of earnings. If you're earning 15% more, you take on 15% more of the rent etc and bills overall (living bills, not her debt bills). That seems more fair than merging.", "NTA. You made the earlier agreement based on thinking you have similar financial situations and attitudes; now that you realize that isn't the case, your thoughts have changed, and that is completely understandable and reasonable. \n\nPersonally, I would be concerned over her being mad about it because it could indicate she ran up all that debt BECAUSE she expected you to take on a large part in paying it off.", "NTA.

You have extremely different approaches to managing money and its good that you identified this before you are married. I can say from experience that huge differences in approaches to money can destroy a marriage if they are not identified and addressed.

Being in love with someone doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to protect yourself, and every relationship some amount of boundaries is important.\n\n$125,000 is an important boundary to have, and given that it is a larger spending problem, getting a financial agreement made to go along with your marriage is wise.

If you aren't ready to help her figure out how to handle her debt, you might not be ready to marry her yet, at least not til she gets all of this under control, but you should be able to find a compromise that makes both parties happy and manage to stay together and figure it out. Money is one of the top things that ends relationships, will it end yours? ...

I helped my husband pay off about 30k in CC debt when we married. I make 10x what he does, and I asked myself if I would want his help if the shoes were switched. The answer was yes, so I helped him pay it off, but the tradeoff was that he promised never to get into CC debt again. We do have split finances, but I told him he needs to let me know BEFORE he gets underwater. I only put the kibosh on one large purchase when he was unemployed, when i said if he had that kind of money, he could help pay a (utility) bill. He did start helping with the bill. But here's the deal: we're  *married*. We're in this together. There's no me vs. him. He owes it to me not to go into debt and to be honest about his finances. I owe it to him not to micro manage his spending. We file taxes together and we know where we both stand on income and investments. Decide to marry this woman or not, but do not be controlling financially.  This could be a good teaching moment  to say, \"I love you, I want to spend my life with you, I want to plan for goals like a house, kids, vacations, early retirement, emergencies, etc. Can we sit down and talk about our mutual goals and how we're  going to achieve them? I'm happy to show you how I decide how much to save and what I can afford to spend.\" And remember, up til now, she was a young, single woman who could afford to buy clothes, cars, or whatever - maybe for the first time.

It\u2019s the habits that led to it.", "NAH - but you two are not ready to get married\u2026 like at all. Money fights are the number 1 reason people get divorced. \nYou two have totally different value systems with money, as evidenced by your different spending habits. \nYou should combine finances with your wife, but you shouldn\u2019t marry someone with such drastically different money values. That would need to change in pre marital counseling before you should consider getting married and combining finances.", "NTA.\n\n*If you go forward--* and I'm not saying you should, I don't know if I would-- she absolutely needs to commit to paying off her debt. Before signing any marriage papers, you absolutely need to get a prenup keeping that debt off you AND ALSO sit her down with a financial advisor and come up with an intense payment plan for her debt. This has to, inherently, include cutting up all her credit cards and not giving her access to yours. She has to fully agree to go along with this.\n\nAnd personally, if she couldn't keep her spending under control previously, I absolutely would also ask her to give me full access to monitor the debt. This is the sort of debt that I would not be comfortable marrying someone if I couldn't ensure that I could verify every month that she's sticking to the payment plan. Some people might think this is overly financially controlling in a \"separate finances\" marriage, but I have an anxiety disorder and it would literally make me ill to know my partner has such a huge debt and could stop making her payments to it at any time and I would never know-- for me, this would be a hard boundary, if you have that sort of debt, I need to be able to monitor your payments towards it. With a crazy situation like 50k in credit card debt, I think normal relationship rules do go out the window to some degree: If an adult can't control their spending to that degree of debt, they need someone keeping an eye on the situation.\n\nWhat I'm trying to say is: don't feel guilty about whatever stipulations you feel you need to put on this debt, even if they're not within normal bounds of people with split finances. This is an insane amount of credit card debt for you to get yourself involved with, if she's not willing to go along with whatever you need to make this relationship work with the debt, then you should not be marrying her.\n\nIf you get married and she stays on track with making her monthly payments and shows that she is committed to change, in that situation I, *personally*, would either be willing to take on a higher percentage of the everyday expenses so that she can contribute more to her debt OR offer a contribution towards her debt (within my budget, not more than she herself is contributing) to speed the payment along because regardless of if you make sure that debt is not legally tied to you, her debt *will* affect you for years to come regardless. But that's just my opinion, not an obligation you'd be an asshole not to do. I myself would probably err on the side of paying the debt directly-- as long as that didn't cause issues with debt ownership and responsibility where you live, if you're considering this, do talk with the financial advisor/your pre-nup laweyer beforehand-- at whatever amount you're willing to part with over taking over more of the day-to-day expenses because, I'll be honest, nothing about this person gives me the sense that if I took on more of the expenses, she would be able to commit that extra money to the debt and not see it as spending money.\n\nFinally, I would absolutely not commit to her if she wasn't willing to agree that *after the debt is paid*, she won't take on more than two new credit cards, each with a low credit limit that she's willing to let me continue to monitor for my peace of mind. I might not necessary chose to watch her credit card, but I would absolutely want to know the login information so I *could*, in theory. Again, that might just be me and my anxiety speaking. (Note: the two credit cards is a very deliberate number-- having two credit cards means you can get a Visa, a Mastercard, a debit card, and with those three cards you probably won't end up in a situation where a vendor who isn't cash-only doesn't accept any of the credit cards you have on you, plus a debit. If you're prone to debt, this is the maximum amount of cards anyone could argue that they need.)\n\nMarriage isn't just about finding someone to love, it's also about finding someone you can buy a home with, ect.

My now-husband (boyfriend at the time) had an inkling but not 100% knowledge of my situation. \n\nI finally broke down. Admitted it all. He was unhappy, obviously. But he supported me as I went through therapy, realized my spending wasn\u2019t just \u2018out of control\u2019 but was likely a coping mechanism/borderline addiction for my untreated depression/ADHD. Did some addictions Counselling, got properly medicated, and started making steps in the right direction. \n\nI have 4, almost 3 now, years left on the consolidation loan for that 35k (it was multiple sources of debts so I combined it for a lower payment+interest fee).

As you already know, you will then walk into $125k of debt and will either need to wipe out a big chunk of your savings to clear it or keep making payments forever. \n\nPlus it sounds like Tina will not stop spending like she hit the lottery so the debt will just continue. This is a huge \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. You seriously need a prenup and have to reconsider how your future together will work now that you know she just spends and expected you to pay it off for her.", "You have very different views on debt, spending, and the value of money. You have to reconcile these differences before getting married. She wants to pretend those differences don't exist. That is not the recipe for a healthy marriage. NTA.", "NTA\n\nNo wonder she wanted to merge finances. You are protecting yourself and if she cannot see that then she was truely just looking to use you to pay off her debt imo.", "NTA. Personally I wouldn\u2019t marry this person. When you get married you become one unit, it appears that as long as you two are together you will be helping her out of debt. \n\nMaybe you can suggest her to sit down with someone to help her go over her finances so she can make a plan and get out of debt. Also learn about debt and how not to overspend. I feel like if you tell her this she will feel like you are attacking her", "NTA. I find it super suspicious that Tina never mentioned her debt before, especially if you were already discussing finances. Seems like a pretty important detail to leave out.", "NTA, but if you get married her debt IS your debt.", "NTA. When you talked about combining finances she should have been up front about her debt. And why would she be upset about you not wanting to take on her debt? Because she doesn't want to change her ways.", "Absolutely NTA.", "If you merge, you'll still have your shabby clothes and she'll swank around even more....on your dime!", "NTA\n\nHiding her financial responsibilities (50k in credit card debt?) Is a huge financial red flag.", "NTA is she upset because she thought you would help her with her debt? You need to talk about her finances and be adults about this. If it turns into a screaming match then you guys need to re-think getting married. Get on the same page about this", "Nope! That would be crazy to do it differently", "Nta at all!!! \nThat is so much debt I couldn\u2019t even imagine. \nDefinitely talk to a lawyer and do not back down!", "NTA. Your \u201chandshake\u201d agreement to merge finances would obviously need to be talked about in detail between you before proceeding. This kind of debt is serious and it\u2019s reasonable for you to react this way.", "You aren\u2019t legally responsible for her debts.", "NTA. You\u2019ll not only take on her debt but incur more because Tina will just have life money to spend. She needs financial counseling to pay off her debt and learn how to live on a budget. \n\nPlease put off marrying her until she has demonstrated this.", "Lol nta but it\u2019s crazy how someone can \u201cappear\u201d so rich when in truth, are drowning in debt. Don\u2019t judge a book by its cover. Also, it cost a lot of money to \u201clook good\u201d- yes I\u2019m semi hating bc I wanna look good too but too cheap to maintain it \ud83e\udd23\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "NTA.  When you talked about merging finances, you were missing critical info.  She was looking to get out of a bad situation, and not telling you about it beforehand was... disingenuous at best.", ">  She argued that we always talked about joining our lives and sharing everything and now I\u2019m having doubts.   \n    \nNTA.  \"Yes we did.  But you failed to disclose.  How much debt you are in.  We make roughly the same.  I assumed we were in the same position.  Only to find out.  We are not even close.  Maybe you looked at it as a way out of debt.  But that doesn't work for me.  If you like.  We can take things slow.  But I am not taking on the debt.\"", "NTA, but run. She didn't tell you about the state of her finances for a reason. She's angry that you didn't merge finances because she wants you to support her unsustainable lifestyle. Even if you kept your finances separate and got a prenup, this is not going to be a happy relationship. Tina has enough commitments to sort out already before committing to marriage.", "NTA. You\u2019re doing all the right things from my perspective. \n\nI was just like Tina, though I was the one making much more money in my marriage.\n\nI had a lot of bad money habits and a bad emotional relationship with money. And I was pretty unconscious with spending and saving for years. I have had to do a lot of mental, emotional, and spiritual work where finances are concerned even though I make good money. \n\nI hope you both can speak freely and easily about money and how you want to function together financially. If you can\u2019t, take all the time you need until you can. Finances kill a lot of relationships.", ">I told her I have no doubts about spending the rest of my life with her, I just don\u2019t want to take on so much debt.\n\nShe's $125k in debt with good earning job.  It sounds like she's been living above her means for at least months, but likely years.  You are the opposite and value living within your means and even saving.\n\nHow can you reconcile a life together if you share such different outlooks on life?  How does this work out day to day when she continues to spend herself deeper into debt, and you don't want to do that to yourself?  What happens when its a joint purchase, and she's fine spending way over your collective means, and you don't want to?  Who wins?  \n\nNTA, but if neither of you is willing to adopt the other's spending habits, I don't see a future for you together.", "NTA. Debt isn\u2019t an issue in general IMO, it\u2019s the attitude towards the debt. She doesn\u2019t seem to have the same mindset on money that you do. \n\nSeems like a big incompatibility issue, sorry", "Actually you\u2019re changing your mind after finally getting serious about financials, which you left until the \u201clast minute\u201d. Why don\u2019t you guys see a financial counselor/advisor? It costs a hell of a lot to look great all the time, will you feel the same about her if she cuts back on her self care? Will she want to? It\u2019s part of who she is and that\u2019s who you fell in love with. Really, get a mediator/counselor to help you both navigate this. Also, are you cheap? You save a lot and that\u2019s great but do you plan on vacations, dates, fun after you\u2019re married or are you going to be a major tightwad? Something to figure out.\n\nETA: NTA. Just be open, loving, and fair above all. Explore your financial boundaries together.", "NTA. \n\nBut\u2026.your saving and her spending are radically different. You need a serious conversation on budgeting, spending, and debt payment plan before you get married. If merging finances is your idea of partnership you need to consider maybe this isn\u2019t the right partner. Can you live with her continuously spending and you staying frugal to cover the differences? Personally, I couldn\u2019t. I married and merged finances and paid off the debt my husband had. He brought no fiscal assets to the marriage, I owned my condo and had a large savings/retirement. But we discussed the importance of saving, what our views of money were, and how we would handle the finances before getting married. \n\nIf your looking at separate finances and prenups, are you sure this is what you want?", "Nta, this is an example of love not being enough, if she doesn\u2019t respect you enough to understand and get her finances in order then that\u2019s another issue that needs to be resolved.", "Nta it sounds like she may have been intemdimg to make you responsible for her debt.", "NTA, but don\u2019t expect her to change her ways, you would be better off with someone who shares in your same goals. I would consider this a red flag that looking back on it will only bring about regret.", "NTA.  Once you\u2019re married, her debt is your debt.", "Nta. Kinda seems like she's pissed you won't be taking on her debt for her.", "I kind of want to hear how much they make. This is a lot, for some people. Fianc\u00e9e was able to get a $75k car note with $50k credit card debt already? The bank knows more than we do.", "This.  And how did he imagine she supported that flashy style he likes so much?", "But OP likes her the way she is, driving a snazzy car, spending hundreds every month on self care, hair, nails, clothes, etc. Will he like her as much if she goes back to her natural mousy hair color, short natural nails, wearing the same 5 outfits all the time? He wants the snazzy girl, he just doesn\u2019t want to pay for it. I\u2019m actually not talking about the debt, he\u2019s right to not take that on at least not without a plan, but he needs to realize that if she buckles down she\u2019s going to have to cut back and maybe he won\u2019t like her as much without all the self care. I also wonder if he will end up being cheap and not generous throughout their lives together. I think they need financial and couples counseling.", "> When they get to retirement age, is OP going to quit working and live off his savings while he watches Tina go to work every day because she has no savings?\n\nI remember an advice column letter that was this exact situation.   Wife was nearing retirement and had decent savings, but husband still lived paycheck to paycheck. She was wondering what the heck was going to happen when they both hit retirement in a few years", "NTA, you should think about postponing your marriage also until she learns to live within her means. After you get married she will expect you to pay most of the bill because she has a lot of debt. Or she will want you to pay part of her debts. Definitely talk to an attorney about a prenup and her debts is hers and your savings are yours.", "NTA. She\u2019s not responsible with money.", "She was counting on you taking on that debt w/ her ! Which of course you shouldn\u2019t !  She knew what her debt is & planning on you helping . She is not going to be happy - but too bad .", "Yeah, I ended a relationship over financial issues.  The idea of adding on a chunk of debt scared me, but I could have come around on that.  What I couldn\u2019t hack was him feeling completely comfortable charging concert tickets when his credit cards (multiple!) were maxed and he could barely make the minimum payment each month.  In his opinion I broke off a great relationship over $100 - he couldn\u2019t even see that it was his \u201ceat, drink, and be merry\u201d attitude toward debt that terrified me.  Financial security is really important to me - probably to a bit of an unhealthy extreme honestly.  I couldn\u2019t imagine me trying to save money and live within a budget only to have it constantly blown by his need to not miss experiences.", "So you guys had this whole conversation about combining all your finances and she never told you that she has $50,000 in credit card debt? That's a big thing to hide, and you don't do that accidentally! You have every right to change your mind now because she never told you the truth! \n\nIf I were you I would not get married until that credit card debt was gone! Anybody carrying that much credit card debt clearly doesn't understand how interest rates work. Maybe a sit down with a financial advisor might help her? Once she realizes that a $300 purchase ends up costing her over $400 by the time she pays it off, she'll stop putting so much on credit cards. Or maybe she was purposely living beyond her means because she knew she was going to be combining finances with you shortly? You're certainly NTA", "Not to mention that average credit card interest rates are at 22% right now, meaning that she will be paying a heck of a lot more than $50000 back.", "Honestly make a plan and stick to it, it may take years but it's doable. In 2016 shit hit the fan for us (we lost 70k of income that year + I was already pregnant with baby #2 so it was really stressful time) and it wiped out our savings + 23k in credit card and line of credit debt (not counting mortgage and car payment). We have an ok cushion atm but cleared our last payment from the debt last month!!! So now that monthly money is gonna go in full back into our savings. We're gonna crack down hard on it this winter as we need a new roof and a new deck and we're aiming to pay for both those big expenses without needing to borrow again while not fully emptying our emergency savings.", "and...?\n\nDon't leave us hanging here.", "My understanding is that student loans aren't usually considered the same as other debt when banks consider loans for cars, houses, etc.  I believe that is why they are considered \"good debt\".  Not 100% sure on that however.", "We almost married the same man!  \n\n\nI see him and his wife on SM still and their lives are great house, lots of trips, three kids with everything, etc etc etc - and I just always have a flash of \"we'll make more\" he'd always say and have a mix of relief it's not me and worry for them."]}
