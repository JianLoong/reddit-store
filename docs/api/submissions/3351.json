You have information now that you didn\u2019t then and the decision to not combine finances immediately is not only a self preservation process but also a decision that protects your mental and financial wellbeing and in turn the health of your future marriage.\n\nI would absolutely recommend that you speak with an attorney. I would also recommend being totally transparent with her about it and maybe offering to help her with getting her finances under control and counseling her on debt management and living within her means. \n\nShe\u2019s probably taking this as an attack. That\u2019s the best intentions assumption. Worst case is that she was hoping to merge finances and debt burden and benefit from your fiscal responsibility to alleviate her debt. I wouldn\u2019t suggest assuming that necessarily but I think your instincts are correct that you should proceed cautiously until she\u2019s proven she can act responsibly with the money she expects to share (and spend) with you.", "NTA, and get a prenup.", "NTA. The car note isn't necessarily concerning if she has a job and is able to pay that off, but $50k in credit card debt is absolutely bonkers. I wouldn't marry her until that was fully paid off. \n\nYou definitely need both a prenup and she needs to speak to a financial advisor and budget planner.", "NTA.  But realize, your relationship is probably over.  I'm not saying you should do it (you shouldn't), but there is no way this ends well.\n\nEven *if* you helped her get past the current situation - this is the lifestyle she lives.  She's not going to change.  If anything, once her debt goes away - it will only get worse.  As compatible as you think you are, you really aren't.", "NTA. You agreed to sharing a life, not her debt. That's her responsibility and hers alone.\nShould you both decide to go through with the wedding then you need to protect yourself and your assets, while laying down hard boundaries with your money.", "NTA. I'm sure if you had this information when you were all discussing merging your finances you would have never agreed.", "NTA\n\nYou guys may want to invest in some marriage counseling and really talk through junk. Tina clearly has a spending problem and if you two don\u2019t get ahead of that it is going to lead to bitterness that will eventually turn into a divorce.\n\nI had 70k in school loans when we got married. Debt isn\u2019t terrible but the inability to get out of it or change habits will cause a lot of friction.\n\nYou really don\u2019t want to move forward without a good plan.", "NTA. But this is so much bigger than what a pre-nup or splitting finances can fix. You two are highly incompatible and this relationship is on its way to ending. Having similar financial habits is fundamental to every relationship. This is a deal breaker. You should have known this years ago.\n\nEven if she sells the car, buckles down and gets that debt taken care of, her behavior means you will always be carrying the financial burden. Even with separate finances, married couples function as a financial unit. You will be footing the bill for major expenses and indirectly supporting her. Come retirement time, if your investments are significantly greater, you will just end up supporting her then too. Like it or not, marriage means your lifestyle and net wealth are forever tied to that other person, for better or worse.\n\nDifferent jurisdictions have different laws (talk to the lawyer).   But it is very difficult to isolate yourself from the other person's bad financial habits. Plus, if one is a saver and has more, the other becomes dependent on them and your relationship takes on this weird power dynamic.", "NTA. She must have known the position she was in, and chose not to share that info - even in a general \"I have a decent chunk of debt I'm paying off\" sense - when first discussing future financials. I get being embarrassed and avoiding, but it's unreasonable to hold someone to a plan they made while you withheld key information.\n\nIf nothing else, surely it's sensible to have one of you with good credit and/or investments insulated from that debt in case you guys need it, rather than fully merging so utilisation is maxed out and investments are at risk. She needs to get a plan under her for clearing this, and expecting you to help when she hasn't even made a real effort herself is very selfish and short-sighted.", "NTA. The amount of money your fianc\u00e9 owes is a huge burden. She needs a financial advisor. This may help with curbing her spending money she doesn\u2019t have. Maybe once she realizes how long it will take to pay off her debts, she\u2019ll change her spending habits. You have every right to be concerned with your future finances. Hope everything works out for the both of you. Good luck !", "Get the prenup. It it can cover assets and debts. CYA. \n\nNTA", "NTA. You didn\u2019t know she was in that much debt when you agreed and taking it on is crazy.\n\nPlus I don\u2019t think merging finances is ever a really good idea.", "Nta pre nup", "NTA. Never mingle finances. Looks like you need a prenuptial agreement, too. You may even reconsider marriage completely until she can show she's financially responsible. You two may not be a good fit because if she's so in debt, she may never do better. Some people just aren't good with money.", "NAH. You two have different approaches to a huge topic in a relationship - money.  This is more about communication and beliefs.\n\nWhat if your soon to be wife never changes as it relates to finances, how would you feel?", "NTA, that's a huge pile of manye she owes and paying off her expensive lifestyle shouldn't be placed on you", "Ah the old bait and switch! You\u2019re NTA but I would guess at least some of her debt was accrued with the mindset that you\u2019ll be helping deal with that in the future. Sorry bud but if you get married, you will look back to this when you\u2019re getting divorced and realize it was over before it even started.", "NTA\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut it will end your relationship.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd: You ARE an AH for your timing. YOu would have needed to do that BEFORE getting engaged, and BEFORE agreeing to merge finances.

My debt would only bring us both down. He gives me money when I need (SAHM) and he has a credit card for both of us.", "Nta.  I agree with what other have said,  your relationship is on its way to being over.  You are not compatible when your fundamental values are so different.  You live beneath your means and invest in your future.  She lives in the moment, spending everything she has and more.  There is a reason why so many marriages end over money.  It\u2019s a core value you need to be on the same page as your partner.  She is not a 21 year old acting irresponsible with a credit card.  She is 32 years old.  This is who she is.", "NTA \nFinances are a primary issue in relationships.\n\nHave you thought about just having your account and you deal with your preexisting bills, she have her account to deal with her preexisting bills and a joint house account that deals with joint finances? I would also recommend that you both speak to a financial consultant before marriage. Not sure what state or country you are in but I  would hate for you to end up with debt that isn't yours.\n\nWhere I am from pre and post marriage debt can remain seperate; just don't put your name on any of her preexisting accounts or refinances.", "Nah. Your both should have discussed the details before deciding to merge finances. Now it is that you don't want to take on her debt. While that is natural, it's going to feel like you aren't committed. \n\nBut please understand the biggest issue is not what you both have done in the past with money but what you will do in the future. You are a saver. She is a spender. You don't care about appearances. She does. Have you discussed how you are going to merge those styles? For example - what kind of home you want to live in?", "NTA but ultimately you should cut your loss and move on. Marriage is a partnership where you don\u2019t look adoringly at each other but looking toward the same goal and it seems unlikely you guys can come to that agreement. Current finance is just the beginning of the series of big talk you should be having before marriage. Have you discussed children, supporting your and her parents in old age, your own retirement plan and financial goal, contingency for when you are sick/burn out and can\u2019t work. All of these are bare minimum a married couple should agree on. \n\nEven keeping finance separate won\u2019t be the answer. What happened when she can\u2019t pay the bill or her debt? Can you sit by and look at the woman you love stress out? What kind of home life would that create?\n\nPersonally, I find her way of living reckless and unsustainable but this excessive spending on debt could also be a coping mechanism so I don\u2019t want to judge. Your relationship doesn\u2019t have a chance unless she\u2019s willing to change and put real effort into sorting out her finances. Or you decided to hell with saving and contingencies let\u2019s just spend. I doubt you are willing to that.", "NTA\n\nUnless Tina takes on a major lifestyle change here, this situation is not going to get any better.\n\nProblem is, after years or building up a specific image, I doubt she will change.", "NTA. She's living way above her means and you should not be responsible for her debt.", "FOLLOW YOUR GUT! I\u2019ve seen this play out 2 ways, Mostly bad. Usually the partner in debt remains in debt, and with the reduction in bills, spends more. It happens a LOT. If she were working through a debt reduction plan of some sort, (cutting extra spending, reducing ongoing expenses, putting extra money towards paying down debt, etc) then that might be a different story. \n\nIn most states, debts and assets accumulated before the wedding remain the sole responsibility of the person who racked them up. There are some states where if the partner helps pay on the debts, then they can be held liable as well, so talk to a lawyer. \n\nOne option might be to setup a new joint checking account where you both put an agreed amount of money in each month for bills and household items. Then do a gradual joining. Phase 2 is becoming an authorized user on ONE of each others cards (you should each still have 2 cards in your name from different issuers), then later, as she shows how well she\u2019s getting her debt in control, you can look into merging finances completely. But you should each keep your own account for some things, like her paying her debts down. \n\nIf you wouldn\u2019t put the obligation of your debt on to her, then she shouldn\u2019t be willing to put hers on to you. If this is such a problem for her, then you have to consider that you and your fianc\u00e9 have a massive incompatibility that needs to be addressed. She\u2019s a fully grown adult, so these were her choices and her actions that are causing this. If she\u2019s not fixing them, then marring her is going to mean a world of hurt. \n\nNTA", "NTA. That\u2019s a \ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9\ud83d\udea9. It\u2019s not even student debt. She\u2019s irresponsible with her resources. It is 840", "nta. She blew up because she thought you should want to bail her out. Big red flag.", "NTA That's really shitty and shady that you just found out about this now. My wife's parents wanted her to get a prenup until they found out I was fuckin loaded.

We didn't get a prenup but I have money overseas in swiss bank accounts", "NTA.  To be fair, you're not really changing you mind, you're backing out of a decision because you got material information you didn't have at the time the information is made.\n\nNow, she must make a decent income to qualify for a $75k car on her own, despite the existing debt.  How dire is her ability to pay it off?", "NTA.  I would need to see proof (ie long term progress) she can be financial responsible before tying the knot.  Even if the debt magically went away, there will be more until she learns a new lifestyle.", "NTA but the relationship may not survive. Finances are a big thing in relationships and you have to be on the same page even if you keep your finances separate. We didn\u2019t talk finances before getting married but we were teenagers. In your thirties you\u2019ve had your chance to be young and dumb and learn from it. If she is still living above her means then y\u2019all may not be compatible. Will your marriage end up being you covering the big purchases and saving for retirement while she continues to flounder? I only see the relationship working if she is making an effort to turn her finances around and is changing her spending habits.", "NTA.\n\nBetter you realized it now than after you got married. \n\nThing is, you got some additional information that you didn't have before, and therefore you changed your mind.  That is a normal way to handle things. \n\nShe is mad because she was going to go from her debt to \"our\" debt, and you'd have to be responsible for it too. \n\nIf she can't realize this and that its not fair for you to take on her debt, she may not be the one to marry.   Financial things cause divorces all the time.", "ESH\n\n\nYou blindly agreed to do this...and changed your mind. So yeah that makes you an ahole.\n\nAlso complaining about her debt related to a vehicle is also an ahole point. It's an expected debt and you know this. It's the same as complaining about someone have debt due to a mortgage.\n\nHer having 50k on cards is concerning. I get wanting to keep money seperate..but you should have discussed this before in detail before agreeing to anything. Again you promised repeatedly to do this without concern for actually checking her finances first. You acted like a \"big man\" till you saw what was coming and then cried off. I mean you bragged about how you liked her looks and expensive taste.....and you want to keep that without paying for it....what!?!\n\nYou claim she's the one and the live of your life----- but your reaction on here says otherwise. You speak only about yourself and protecting your concerns. Why wouldn't you ask to do financial planning services to prepare yourselves and help her?? And easy compromise of joint expense account and seperate accounts would have been best for you guys.\n\nNow it's like you saw something wrong with your partner and you just screamed \"abandon ship ...everyman for themselves\".... You're whining about her debt... ..and she's probably wondering about your loyalty and lack of spine. Everyone sucks here.", "NTA but unless she\u2019s willing to make serious changes this will be a major issue in your relationship. She\u2019s a spender who likes to live beyond her means. Even if you separate your finances, you will still feel the effects of her irresponsible behavior. If she can\u2019t pay her half of the bills it will fall on you to pick up the slack. Also think long term about retirement. I wouldn\u2019t marry her without a prenup and that debt cut down by at least half.", "Exactly.

Fiance has 6 digits in savings, owns the house and our other 3 cars (owns them outright, no debt), and is planning on buying a second house for investment. I don't expect him to merge finances with me at all. We're going to have a \"house\" account that we both contribute to according to our income that will go towards kids, house maintenance, bills, etc. But yeah if he wants to help me, that's awesome. But I don't expect it. \n\nOP I think you take on your fiance's debt at marriage either way, don't you? I'd maybe not marry her until that debt is under control.", "> NTA. The car note isn't necessarily concerning if she has a job and is able to pay that off, but $50k in credit card debt is absolutely bonkers. I wouldn't marry her until that was fully paid off.\n\nSpending 75k on a car when you already have 50k in CC debt absolutely is concerning.", "Yeah, that's not the way it works in reality. Even if she is putting $50,000 of her personal money into her debt, that is $50,000 that is not being invested in the marriage and long term savings. That is $50,000 not available for the house down payment or the surprise shingle job or new deck. That money has to come from somewhere and he will indirectly foot the bill regardless. That $50,000 would have benefited *both* people in the marriage, but instead it is paying down a single person's debt and not accessible to both.\n\nWhat, he is just going to live out his golden years going on cruises and staying at their vacation property, while his wife barely makes ends meet in a shoddy one bedroom apartment?!", "ESH\n\nI agree with you, but Tina is also an AH for not telling OP that she has a decent amount of debt. She obviously knew all along and planned on him helping her pay off debt.", "I second all of this. \n\nIf she doesn't resent you now, it's coming.  Although you are free to make your own decisions and change your mind, etc., there will be consequences.", "I mean, to me this is no different than a couple who get engaged, then move in together, but don't realize that they are totally incompatible living with each other.  \n\nIt would've been smarter to do it before getting engaged, I agree.  But now he has the information and has made a different decision.", "I don't think he is as concerned with the lack of savings as with the amount of debt.  She also had 7 less years to rack up debt and spend within her means, which she chose not to do.", "I feel that there\u2019s a thin line there before that can become financial abuse also. You should have money available to you. SAHM is a full time job and you should be paid for that rather than having to ask permission to spend money. No offense. If it works for you two, it works. It can just be a slippery slope depending on your partner.", "Maybe she was worried about being judged. You know, kind of like you are doing now.", "Actually you\u2019re not a Tina.  Based on info provided by OP, Tina\u2019s debt is comprised of $50k credit cards and $75k new electric car.  Yours are $10k student loans and $4.5k car loan.  Even if Tina sells her electric car and manage to pay off the $75k car loan with proceeds, that still leaves her with $50k credit cards where it is not clear what the spend was for.  Perhaps related to \u201cshe looks amazing, like she just stepped out of a magazine cover\u201d ?  Your student loan was (shall we say) less discretionary - hers appear to be very much discretionary and that is the crucial difference.", "So you're agreeing she hid it purposely from her fiance, just for different reasons than me.", "NTA Trust me I have made this mistake do not combine your finances. I did this in my first marriage and it was a disaster he had debt and unpaid student loans that were never mentioned before we got married. I ended up going back to work when our child was three months old because there were creditors knocking on the door weekly- it was horrible. Trust me this type of spending habits won\u2019t change and you will fight over money until one of you can\u2019t do it anymore. It sounds horrible but you are probably better off with just parting ways now before it gets messy.

DONT MARRY HER...\nShe is such a red flag...", "NTA   It\u2019s a reasonable concern and you need to take it a step farther. If you don\u2019t merge finances, what does that look like?  She has 125k of debt. Will she change her spending habits?  Are you willing to forgo vacations or a nicer home because she can\u2019t pay half?  What will retirement look like?  You don\u2019t want to take on her debt and legally there are probably ways to arrange that. \n\nHowever, you still want to share a life with this woman and she\u2019s showing you who she is. Someone that isn\u2019t particularly bothered by that amount of debt. Someone who wants those flashier things. Are you two financially compatible because one spouse is usually subsidizing the other in the situation directly or indirectly. Are you going to resent her if you have to give up things because of her financial choices?

She has priorities (clothes, cars, etc) that don\u2019t mesh with your priority of saving and being deft free. Don\u2019t let yourself be sidetracked into an argument about going back on your word to merge finances. Simply state you did not have the full picture and now that you do -well, you have concerns that need to be addressed. The concerns are your different approaches to spending and saving. Honestly, you may not be compatible for the long term.

You have extremely different approaches to managing money and its good that you identified this before you are married. I can say from experience that huge differences in approaches to money can destroy a marriage if they are not identified and addressed.

Being in love with someone doesn't mean you shouldn't be able to protect yourself, and every relationship some amount of boundaries is important.\n\n$125,000 is an important boundary to have, and given that it is a larger spending problem, getting a financial agreement made to go along with your marriage is wise. Honestly given her blow up about this, it sounds like she was betting on you to fix her financial problems. \n\nThey should be a line you hold. If you do actually want to marry her, your finances should not be merged since you and her have not only large spending habit differences, but entirely different financial situations.\n\nI would also like to point out you didn't change your mind, she intentionally hid large details of the situation, that were pertinent to you making the decision.

If you aren't ready to help her figure out how to handle her debt, you might not be ready to marry her yet, at least not til she gets all of this under control, but you should be able to find a compromise that makes both parties happy and manage to stay together and figure it out. Money is one of the top things that ends relationships, will it end yours? ...

I helped my husband pay off about 30k in CC debt when we married. I make 10x what he does, and I asked myself if I would want his help if the shoes were switched. The answer was yes, so I helped him pay it off, but the tradeoff was that he promised never to get into CC debt again. We do have split finances, but I told him he needs to let me know BEFORE he gets underwater. I only put the kibosh on one large purchase when he was unemployed, when i said if he had that kind of money, he could help pay a (utility) bill. He did start helping with the bill. But here's the deal: we're  *married*. We're in this together. There's no me vs. him. He owes it to me not to go into debt and to be honest about his finances. I owe it to him not to micro manage his spending. We file taxes together and we know where we both stand on income and investments. Decide to marry this woman or not, but do not be controlling financially.  This could be a good teaching moment  to say, \"I love you, I want to spend my life with you, I want to plan for goals like a house, kids, vacations, early retirement, emergencies, etc. Can we sit down and talk about our mutual goals and how we're  going to achieve them? I'm happy to show you how I decide how much to save and what I can afford to spend.\" And remember, up til now, she was a young, single woman who could afford to buy clothes, cars, or whatever - maybe for the first time.
