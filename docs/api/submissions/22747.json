Let\u2019s call my friend Lana.\nI didn\u2019t want to be one because being a bridesmaid can get quite expensive and I wasn\u2019t in the financial situation to afford that luxury but my friend kept begging me to do this for her  (she is my longest and dearest friend) and she offered to pay for all the expenses so I eventually agreed. But all through out the process of dress shopping, planning and hiring the stylists and makeup artist Lana kept silent, I was expecting her to hold up her end of the deal which is paying for the expenses (the morning dress and evening dress, another dress for a traditional ceremony, makeup, nails, hair, etc) but she never did, instead she went radio silent and acted as if she never said what she said, she would ignore my texts and even went to the fittings on the days I couldn\u2019t make it to avoid me. I didn\u2019t want to ask her straight up for the money because I don\u2019t like confrontation and I didn\u2019t want to stir up any drama so I kept quiet and managed to pay for everything with the help of my family.

I was so confused cause no one ever told me that we (the bridesmaids) were contributing to the bridal shower cake, I thought she offered to get the cake herself as a loving gesture to her best friend (the bride). I was already out 4000USD (13k in our currency) for the 3 dresses, hair, makeup, manicure and shoes and I wasn\u2019t about to waste another 1k on a stupid cake I didn\u2019t consent to paying for. I later found out that the cake the bridesmaid got was made by her sister and she got the most expensive cake to help her sister make money. I decided I was not going to pay for it.

You are *definitely* NTA\n\nYou've already been forced to pay **$4000** for something that you didn't even want to do. And to add insult to injury, you're being asked to also contribute **$400** (cake money) to the bride's sister's pocket?\n\nLana is a complete and utter a-hole. Of the highest order.", "NTA. You're getting screwed. \n\nAll those 'rules' about various wedding party members paying for shit have been completely made up in recent years. Not one of them are traditional. Tradition is that the father of the bride pays for the wedding.\n\nNow that couples are paying for their own weddings, the wedding industry had to come up with a way to spread the bill around, because young couples typically don't have the resources that the previous generation does. So somebody made up a bunch of bullshit rules about the bridesmaids and others having to pay. And as you observed, you the bridesmaid isn't being asked. You're being told. Well, forget that. You didn't consent, you weren't even asked, and NO ONE has the power to spend your money without your advance permission.", "NTA. 400 dollars from one person for a cake is insane. How many guests were at this wedding because a quick google search will tell you on average a cake for 200 guests is about 850 dollars for weddings, so either other bridesmaids couldn\u2019t pay it or someone\u2019s not being honest. Either way I wouldn\u2019t pay it. They should have told you when you agreed to be the bridesmaid what was expected from you monetary wise.", "NTA\n\n\nYour 'friend' and the cake lady both sound greedy and gross. \n\nIf she's still asking for the money after months, I'd politely say 'im sorry, but I wasn't part of the discussion beforehand about being required to help purchase the cake. If I had been, I would've worked with you to find a cake I could afford to help pay for. Given the circumstances of the cost being sprung on me after the fact, I regret to tell you that I do not have the funds you requested. Sorry for any inconvenience. Thank you, ___' \n\nOr something along those lines. It may be in bad taste..but it's also in bad taste to take it upon yourself to purchase something, and then decide afterwards that you want everyone else to help pay for the thing you chose to purchase. That's not how it works\n\n\nI also hope you're able to resell the dresses (if you want) in order to recoup some of your funds. \n\nYou're a saint for paying 4k to be a part of someone else's wedding", "Info \u2014 have you actually told her that you\u2019re refusing to pay for cake?

It's unreasonable to spring a bill on you after the fact.  You were used by you (hopefully) ex-griend Lana , the bride and the bridesmaid.

This is not something you can just spring on someone last minute AND after the fact.  That is complete BS.  I wouldn't put money towards the cake either.  How much did the damn cake cost?

At least it's a lesson youll remember.
