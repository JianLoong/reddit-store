My sis (for the sake of anonymity I will call her \u201cCass\u201d) is pretty now, but to be honest, that hasn\u2019t always been true. Of the two of us I was always considered the \u201cprettier sister\u201d. I don\u2019t mean this badly, but I do know what people meant by this. I am conventionally attractive (long blond hair, green eyes, tall, slim) and she is on the shorter side, naturally frizzy dark hair, used to be 10 lbs. heavier than she should\u2019ve been at 5\u20193, and chubbier in the face. Because of this Cass grew up extremely insecure and would take it out on me and attempt to sabotage me anytime something in my life was going better for me than for her. For example, even though I\u2019m younger, I got engaged before her (my wedding is in October). My sister already has her dress for the wedding and, what do you know? It\u2019s the closest shade to white as it can be (champagne and ugly AF). I\u2019ve put it behind me but I feel her jealousy and insecurities have put a wedge in our relationship.\n\nRecently Cass got into a relationship with her current boyfriend. Their relationship has surprisingly been going really well (I guess she finally found a guy who can handle her pettiness lol). About a year before this relationship, she got a nose job, started working out, changed her hair and just looks a lot better. As shallow as this may sound, I am recently less embarrassed to introduce her to people ever since she has been putting in effort.\n\nAnyway, I was out to dinner on the 4th of July with some family and friends, and Cass brought her boyfriend. Cass and her boyfriend were seated across from me and my fianc\u00e9. The dinner was going fairly well until Cass started pissing me off by bringing up a story from when I was 12 and saying I was always \u201csuch a brat\u201d and \u201cso needy and entitled\u201d and that thankfully I\u2019ve \u201cat least slightly changed since then\u201d while doing this annoying high pitched squeaky giggle she only does when she\u2019s with her boyfriend. My annoyance led to me realizing Cass\u2019s boyfriend probably has no idea what she used to look like prior to her glow up as I doubt Cass showed him any photos. So I spoke up suddenly and said I had some funny photos to share of Cass and me when we were about 8 and 10. There\u2019s a photo on my phone where we are both at the beach, but her swimwear is way too small for her and you can see how heavy she is. Cass was angry before I even had the photo ready and tried to lean across the table to grab the phone out of my hands, but her boyfriend grabbed her wrist and stopped her before she could. I showed my fianc\u00e9 and her boyfriend the photo which led to awkward silence before her boyfriend said \u201cThat\u2019s you?\u201d in disbelief and Cass immediately began crying. She got up and left to go to the bathroom, not before saying I\u2019m a B and making people in the restaurant look at us. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m in the wrong here because of the way she acted but my fianc\u00e9 thinks I was immature.
