My sis (for the sake of anonymity I will call her \u201cCass\u201d) is pretty now, but to be honest, that hasn\u2019t always been true. Of the two of us I was always considered the \u201cprettier sister\u201d. I don\u2019t mean this badly, but I do know what people meant by this. I am conventionally attractive (long blond hair, green eyes, tall, slim) and she is on the shorter side, naturally frizzy dark hair, used to be 10 lbs. heavier than she should\u2019ve been at 5\u20193, and chubbier in the face. Because of this Cass grew up extremely insecure and would take it out on me and attempt to sabotage me anytime something in my life was going better for me than for her. For example, even though I\u2019m younger, I got engaged before her (my wedding is in October). My sister already has her dress for the wedding and, what do you know? It\u2019s the closest shade to white as it can be (champagne and ugly AF). I\u2019ve put it behind me but I feel her jealousy and insecurities have put a wedge in our relationship.\n\nRecently Cass got into a relationship with her current boyfriend. Their relationship has surprisingly been going really well (I guess she finally found a guy who can handle her pettiness lol). About a year before this relationship, she got a nose job, started working out, changed her hair and just looks a lot better. As shallow as this may sound, I am recently less embarrassed to introduce her to people ever since she has been putting in effort.\n\nAnyway, I was out to dinner on the 4th of July with some family and friends, and Cass brought her boyfriend. Cass and her boyfriend were seated across from me and my fianc\u00e9. The dinner was going fairly well until Cass started pissing me off by bringing up a story from when I was 12 and saying I was always \u201csuch a brat\u201d and \u201cso needy and entitled\u201d and that thankfully I\u2019ve \u201cat least slightly changed since then\u201d while doing this annoying high pitched squeaky giggle she only does when she\u2019s with her boyfriend. My annoyance led to me realizing Cass\u2019s boyfriend probably has no idea what she used to look like prior to her glow up as I doubt Cass showed him any photos. So I spoke up suddenly and said I had some funny photos to share of Cass and me when we were about 8 and 10. There\u2019s a photo on my phone where we are both at the beach, but her swimwear is way too small for her and you can see how heavy she is. Cass was angry before I even had the photo ready and tried to lean across the table to grab the phone out of my hands, but her boyfriend grabbed her wrist and stopped her before she could. I showed my fianc\u00e9 and her boyfriend the photo which led to awkward silence before her boyfriend said \u201cThat\u2019s you?\u201d in disbelief and Cass immediately began crying. She got up and left to go to the bathroom, not before saying I\u2019m a B and making people in the restaurant look at us. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m in the wrong here because of the way she acted but my fianc\u00e9 thinks I was immature.

Grow up and realize the world doesn't revolve around you and your looks. \n\nYTA massively.", "The fact you felt the need to even do something like this to your sister proves otherwise.\nHopefully your fianc\u00e9 figures out who you truly are and leaves.", "Says the person who admitted to being embarrassed to have their sister around others in public before said sister changed her look.\n\nThat's called insecure as fuck.", "I can think of a few things...self awareness, kindness, class. These are all qualities your responses show you greatly lack.", "Yup. Your going have a bad middle age , lol , it's already started", "Are you sure?  Your sister is what I would call a late bloomer, and know that the attention is on her, you are so green with envy you don\u2019t know what to do. \n\nYou talk about how your sister was insecure, but I wonder how much of it came from hearing how her younger sister was considered the prettier one.", "You sound ugly", "You literally state that you posted this because you need reassurance you\u2019re not the asshole.", "The fact that you had to try to say you're not shows that you are.\n\nSomeone who's secure doesn't care if others think they're insecure.", "Nah, it\u2019s you. Even internet strangers can see your jealousy and insecurity; imagine what your friends and family REALLY think but they don\u2019t say much to not deal with an entitled woman.", "You are the petty one, not the pretty one.\n\nYou may be conventional blonde with green eyes but that doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re pretty. For all we know that blonde hair makes you look like a giant toe, or since you\u2019re tall and skinny, a middle finger", "Yeah, that's why you keep reminding yourself and everyone else you were better looking when you were younger.\n\nYTA. You don't like your sister and it shows", "No she is not, honey I'm sorry but you're the one who is jealous and insecure, you were the as.... \nIn your post you express the envy you have of her, completely insulting and saying that you are even ashamed of her, let her be happy with her boyfriend and focus on being a better person and sister ( btw being fat is not being ugly you need to open horizons)", "Hahaha read your post again. If you really felt better then her, you wouldn't feel the need to compare yourself to her in everything. Also, so you were prettier when you were 10? Who cares?? You bringing up that photo shows you clinging to that, as well as being a reaaaaly shady petty disrespectfull person. \n\nNot even talking about the fact you showed a bikini pic of someone that they didnt want shared. Regardless of the context that is messed up. \n\nEverything about this post is though, you need therapy and a loot of reflection girl. YTA.", "Uh huh.  You showed this side of yourself to your fiance, good job!", "HAHAHAHAHAHAHA", ">I have nothing to be jealous of or insecure about.\n\nLol that's not how jealousy works.", "Babe,hun,sis,girlfriend, you sound jealous your sister had a \"glow up\" and you seem wildly insecure because for whatever reason you needed her bf to know she was fat at age *checks text* age ten yeah you showed a photo of her when she was a literal child.\n\nGood for you that you USED to be the pretty sister but that ship seams to of sailed but THANK God you got engaged before even tho you are younger because any more time and your hot sister would have stolen your man.

Kim K is the opposite in appearance and I feel like she\u2019s the current cultural standard of beauty. Does OP live in the 1990s?\n\nI\u2019m not saying tall/blond/green eyed people can\u2019t be attractive, just that perceptions of the qualities that are considered attractive have greatly expanded over the last few decades."]}
