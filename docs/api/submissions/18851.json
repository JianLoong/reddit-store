It was very unique and she stood out beautifully, but in my opinion, the dress didn't flatter her, nor the venue and I personally didn't like it, but I wasn't gonna be the person to tell her that on her wedding day and ruin the night for her, so the rest of the day was very fun and I had an incredible time with her and all of our other friends.\n\nMy opinion of her dress I kept to myself because I dislike talking behind people's backs and it isn't my place to tell her what she shouldn't have worn, after all, it was her wedding day and she should wear something she feels amazing in, and I noticed that she had an amazing confident aura wearing that dress and I felt amazing for her.\n\nYesterday, she came to my house to watch a movie with me, before we started watching she talked about how her parents told her that her wedding dress didn't look good and that she should've worn a white simple dress (they are a very traditional type). Then she asked me what I honestly thought about her wedding dress, and most respectfully, I told her that while I thought that the dress made her stand out amazingly and it was very unique, in my personal opinion, I wasn't very fond of it and that it did not flatter her. She was quiet for a second then she got up and left, even though I tried explaining to her that I didn't mean to offend or insult her, she left in the end. I tried messaging her but I got no response.\n\nToday her husband messaged me saying that she cried for hours after I met with her, that I was very disrespectful, and that I had no place to criticise her dress. One of her best friends sent me a long message about how while he agrees with me, I didn't have to tell her that because it isn't our place and that I came across as jealous and pathetic.\n\nI don't know what to do or say and I'm having trouble even contemplating whether I was wrong, so what do you think, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: someone told me to add this comment reply to my post,\n\n\"At first, I told her that she stood out and looked confident and left it at that, but then she asked me \"I didn't ask you if I looked confident or unique, I asked you what you thought about the dress\" I didn't want to lie to her since we've always had a very blunt relationship she's always told me the blunt truth, but keeping in mind that it was obviously a really big day for her I tried to be kind and sensitive about my honest opinion. But I see that I may have been too rude and not considerate of her feelings, thank you for your comment! I'll try to make things right with her if she will give me another chance.\"\n\nBut also guys, seriously thank you so much for actually making me realize I was definitely in the wrong, I didn't really think it through many times in my head and just said what I was truthfully feeling and I understand how wrong it was especially since it was about something she now couldn't change. I've seen a lot of people saying I could have said something before her wedding but I wasn't one of her bridesmaids and she said she wanted to keep everything a surprise, also we've always had a very honest and blunt kind of relationship and she's always told me that she dislikes white lies and if someone asks you something you should always answer it truthfully, this is the woman who told me and my boyfriend of 2 years to break up to our faces because she thought we weren't compatible for each other since he travelled a lot for his work, and although I was upset, looking back I realise that relationship was absolutely going nowhere, this is why I disagree with the comments that say that I should've just lied, I honestly cannot lie to her and lying about something would make me feel guilty. But I completely take responsibility for talking about the negatives when I should've only spoken about the honest positives. I messaged her if I could meet up with her and she replied saying she was thinking of that too, we're meeting each other in a few hours and I'll try to apologise to her and tell her that it didn't matter what I or her parents thought of her dress, if she felt amazing and confident in it, then that was the perfect dress for her. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, I'll show her this post and will update after I've met with her.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nedit: her in-laws wanted her to wear red because in their culture the bride wears red, she didn't want the traditional dress but they came to a conclusion to at least let the dress be red. I also want to say, that when I said it wasn't flattering on her, I meant that the dress didn't match her height, and some parts were loose on her. Not that she and her body was the problem, but more that the dress didn't perfectly fit her, that is what I told her but I didn't want to go into detail about her in the post which is why I only said it didn't flatter her.

The place to stop in your comment was right after you said the dress made her stand out amazingly and was very unique.  Did you really not pick up on the social cues that she was looking for reassurance, and not brutal honesty?", "NTA\n\nYou kept your opinion to yourself until she approached you and directly asked for your honest opinion.\n\nIt sounds like you told her your opinion whilst trying not to sound overly mean.\n\nYou could argue that perhaps lying would have been a better idea, but equally, you could argue that lying would be insulting to your friend.\n\nI understand why she's upset, but I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA. She has unlocked a life lesson: Don\u2019t ask the question if you aren\u2019t prepared to hear the answer. \n\nThat being said, here\u2019s a tip for you when discussing matters of taste, if you would prefer to avoid situations like these: turn the question back on the asker, and remind them that it doesn\u2019t matter what others think. \n\nHere\u2019s how you could have applied that here:\n\nFriend: \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t like my dress and said it didn\u2019t look good on me. What did you think of it?\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cI\u2019m sorry they said that. Truly, though, it doesn\u2019t matter what any of us thought of your dress. Did you like it?\u201d\n\nFriend: \u201cYes, but do you think it looked bad on me?\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cI think you looked confident and radiant and that it was a beautiful day. How did you feel?\u201d\n\nNotice how I focus on her, and her experience of the day, rather than the dress. I\u2019m helping her channel the good emotions of that day so she can shift more value to that, instead of focussing on the judgements of others. \n\nIf she still pressed you for an opinion, as sometimes happens, you could have responded with gentle honesty. For example, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I would have chosen for myself, but who am I to decide what you should have worn?

So what would a white lie do? \n\nI would probably have focused on the aura of confidence you talked about in your post and that you felt amazing for her. And just try to avoid saying anything specific about the actual dress. If anything, just a comment in there about it being unique and that's probably why her parents said what they said. \n\nI think I'm going NAH, you didn't mean harm, so I'm not going to call you ah for that. but I understand why she got upset too.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you tried to be tactful and respectful with your opinion.

You gave it.", "YTA\n\nLook, I get it, you genuinely didn't mean harm. But you did harm, and it could have been avoided. \n\nI actually agree with all the people saying that you need to \"get better at telling white lies\", BTW. You didn't even need to lie. You just needed to learn to be more careful with your words! As an autistic person who took a LONG time, and (despite being otherwise very intelligent) needed a lot of guidance from friends and family about how to interact appropriately in social settings, one of the first and most important rules that I learned to live by was: \"You don't always need to say all the thoughts in your head out loud.\" \n\nLet me repeat that: Just because you're thinking something doesn't mean that you have to say it. Especially if it's hurtful. You don't have to lie, you just . . . don't have to say the unkind parts. You are still being honest if you just share the GOOD parts of your honest feelings.\n\nNext time, tell her that the dress was striking, unique, and made her stand out from the crowd . . . tell her how beautifully confident she looked in it, and how you're glad that she chose something that made her FEEL gorgeous.

You said so many positive things about her confidence and how great she felt, and that's exactly what you should have told her when she asked how you felt about her wedding dress.

It's good to be honest but your friend wanted support even if they might not have said that outright.

I don\u2019t think what you said to her was that horrible but maybe you should have just left it that personally it wasn\u2019t your style and not said it didn\u2019t flatter her.

She wore a dress she loved but she damn well knew it was going to be a conversation piece. OP sucks because they gave their opinion on a very sensitive topic. Yes, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re honest, everyone should be, but read the room a bit. It\u2019s okay to be like \u201cI loved the confidence you had in that dress, you looked amazing, i personally couldn\u2019t pull off that dress\u201d or something subtle of the dislike for it. Not everything needs the truth, especially if it\u2019s your friends wedding day.

It was very unique and she stood out beautifully, but in my opinion, the dress didn't flatter her, nor the venue and I personally didn't like it, but I wasn't gonna be the person to tell her that on her wedding day and ruin the night for her, so the rest of the day was very fun and I had an incredible time with her and all of our other friends. \n\nMy opinion of her dress I kept to myself because I dislike talking behind people's backs and it isn't my place to tell her what she shouldn't have worn, after all, it was her wedding day and she should wear something she feels amazing in, and I noticed that she had an amazing confident aura wearing that dress and I felt amazing for her. \n\nYesterday, she came to my house to watch a movie with me, before we started watching she talked about how her parents told her that her wedding dress didn't look good and that she should've worn a white simple dress (they are a very traditional type). Then she asked me what I honestly thought about her wedding dress, and most respectfully, I told her that while I thought that the dress made her stand out amazingly and it was very unique, in my personal opinion, I wasn't very fond of it and that it did not flatter her. She was quiet for a second then she got up and left, even though I tried explaining to her that I didn't mean to offend or insult her, she left in the end. I tried messaging her but I got no response. \n\nToday her husband messaged me saying that she cried for hours after I met with her, that I was very disrespectful, and that I had no place to criticise her dress. One of her best friends sent me a long message about how while he agrees with me, I didn't have to tell her that because it isn't our place and that I came across as jealous and pathetic. \n\nI don't know what to do or say and I'm having trouble even contemplating whether I was wrong, so what do you think, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

OP is definitely NTA. Why is OP being punished for answering a simple question with an honest opinion. There is no wrong or right answer. They answered what they truly thought. They held it to themselves during the wedding, never talked trash about the friend. OP also already beat around the bush saying she looked confident and had an amazing aura around her wearing the wedding. Friend pushed for an answer and found out. She should have realized that not everyone is always going to side with her. If this friend couldn't even stand to know that someone else found the dress not flattering, then why even bother asking for someone else's opinion. It sounds like she herself already didn't like the dress and it just solidified her answer which is why she's so upset about it. \n\nOP, I would suggest reaching out to them to apologize, but not taking fault for what you said. If she can't accept that she asked you for an opinion and you gave her an honest one, then maybe next time she shouldn't ask you questions anymore because you will never know when to be honest. They asked for an honest opinion and they aren't always going to get the answer that they are hoping, but why does it matter to her what other people think about her dress? Just because her parents didn't like it? It's like her parent wore the dress, she did. If she already was unsure about the dress herself and her parent's comment made her on the wire, there her answer. Also People need to stop giving a shit about what others think about them. \n\nSide note: Do all these YTA people rather lie to your friend's face and years down the line it comes out to their faces that you lied to them?

You went to your friends wedding and you saw her dress. It wasn\u2019t a traditional gown. Usually, when people wear gowns that are not traditional, there\u2019s a deeper reason or meaning behind it. It could be as simple as they just don\u2019t like traditional wedding gowns, or that one wouldn\u2019t fit their personality. It doesn\u2019t seem like you considered that factor.

Maybe she tried on other dresses before she found her version of perfect, and those ones didn\u2019t make her feel good about herself, maybe they didn\u2019t make her feel amazing. Wedding dresses are very special and are a very touchy subject for some people. She did ask for honesty from you, and you\u2019re not necessarily \u201cwrong\u201d for being honest with her, but there was a different way you could have worded it. She already was made to feel bad and insecure about her dress and the way she looked by her parents who had no tact. She was looking for feedback about the actual dress, but your worded it as \u201cit didn\u2019t flatter her.\u201d This probably made her question whether everyone else saw her this way, instead of the confident, amazing version of herself that you had described. She felt amazing on her wedding, but now she probably feels as though she looked awful and that everyone was judging her.

If the bride didn't want to hear her real opinion, she should have accepted the diplomatic answer.", "Also, why are we perpetuating a culture of lying to each other? OP answered respectfully and supportively, but she also didn\u2019t lie. Why are we teaching each other it is ok to lie to people that we care about?", "Thank you!!! If I don\u2019t want to know the answer to something, I don\u2019t ask the question! I\u2019m so over lying to people.", "She did though and the bride pushed further. This is not on OP at all", "I think there's a difference between unsolicited opinions and solicited though. I hate being put in the position of the OP, I'm not a good liar and prefer to avoid it. Sometimes I can weasel my way out of giving an answer, but I hate that too. I think folks are kind of an asshole for putting people in that position if they can't take a disapproving opinion. If you might not like the answer, maybe don't ask.", "But that isn't the case here. The friend wanted an honest opinion, OP gave it. The problem with brutally honest people isn't that they give an honest opinion when someone asks for an honest opinion, it's that they give an unsolicited insulting opinion and then hide behind being \"brutally honest\". This isn't what OP did", "That will only cause them to assume the worst, it\u2019s a much worse option than just being honest.", "Nah fr. Maybe it\u2019s because I\u2019m from New York, but if a friend asks for my honest opinion on something, I always give it to them in the nicest way I can. I never volunteer my opinion on trivial things like outfits (I hate people who do that) but if I\u2019m asked for an honest opinion, why would I lie? It\u2019s her friend\u2019s fault for opening this can of worms.", "no, it\u2019s a personal preference situation. Because if I asked you an opinion directly, asked you and you lied to my face regardless of if it was a white lie or not, we\u2019re not friends anymore. you\u2019re a liar to me now. you will lie to spare my feelings[which usually isn\u2019t a good thing and ends badly for the person that had info held from them] or to absolve you of guilt. either way, I don\u2019t want to be your friend now. intention and reasoning is definitely important but if I have told you I need and want the truth, you give that to me. it is my responsibility to act accordingly and if I cannot, you have every right to not accept that behavior from me.", "She literally asked for honesty; is \u201cgirl world\u201d also opposite world?", "No.  I am a woman and when I ask for honesty I expect honesty, when I want reassurance I will ask for reassurance.  This mind-fuck of one thing means another causes too many problems.", "I'm just about to head off to meet her and honestly, I agree, I know I said I was definitely wrong, but after reading some more comments, I don't think either of us was particularly in the \"wrong\". I tried to say nice things but she wasn't having any of it and I know that she wanted the truth of what I really thought when she asked me again because I've known this woman since we were 16. Many people in the comments are saying that she wanted reassurance and support, which I 100% get but she didn't ask me that did she? We don't really have the kind of relationship where we know exactly what the other is thinking and just magically mind-read. Though I understand that I may have been harsh, I don't think I was obliged to respond by lying and deflecting her question, even though I tried. I really want to have a good conversation with her about this and I'm hoping that I could understand all of this by the end. ahhh, well wish me luck.", "Yeah. It's super nice to have all of the extra comments information to illustrate things further.", "Did you constantly bug your mother to give you her honest opinion about it and reject all kind things you said about it before she blurted it out?  Because if not, it's not really the same.", "I think the difference here is that that was an unprompted opinion nobody asked for, while in this case the bride was pushing for an honest opinion and got mad when she got one. \n\nIf you were to ask your mom: \"What do you think of the veil\"? And she'd say something like: \"It's more important that you think it's beautiful\", after which you'd push and say: \"No really, do you like it?\" If after all this she'd tell you: \"No I personally wouldn't wear it\", would you get mad? Because that's more comparable to this situation.", "But it\u2019s not the same because you didn\u2019t ask. If OP had just told her it was terrible she would be the AH, but she didn\u2019t say anything until her friend directly asked for her opinion.", "But she asked for honesty, if she wanted to be told she was beautiful then she shouldn't have honest friends. If all she wanted were yes men she shouldn't bother asking real friends for real opinions", "A whole friendship? She's specifically asked her to be honest. If the friend wants to chuck away the friendship because OP did what she asked, that's on her, not OP.", "Ok i really dont get this point. Why dont people value honestly in friendship? Why would giving your friend a DIRECT ANSWER to the question she pushed you to answer,  lead to ruining a whole friendship? Idk maybe this is a difference in values,  because i would have been insulted by the lies and skirting the question, but it seems like quite a few people here would throw a fit if given a direct answer.", ">she's always told me the blunt truth\n\nThe way this is worded sounds like the bride is the one who's always brutally honest, but can't take it when someone is honest with her. I feel like you were put into a bad situation here. I also think she knew in her heart that the dress wasn't flattering but is taking it out on you. If she knew it was flattering, she wouldn't have been demanding that you lie to reassure her.", "\"Yeah I thought you looked great.\"", "No, we\u2019re supposed to be mindreaders and say exactly what the other party wants to hear, even when they demand \u201chonesty\u201d.  /s", "Absolutely agree!!  If you don\u2019t want an honest opinion, don\u2019t ask for one!  And, OP clearly has a relationship with this woman where they were always brutally honest.  You can\u2019t have a relationship like that and get mad when you don\u2019t like the answer.  It can hurt your feelings, but you don\u2019t just walk out & get your friends & family to jump on the bandwagon telling OP what a crappy person she is.  The bride is actually the AH here.", "I learned this lesson the hard way with my first boyfriend LMFAO - you do *not* ask questions if you aren\u2019t prepared for unpleasant answers.", "Agree. I think the friend asked OP *specifically* because they have that honest and blunt relationship. So friend\u2019s fears were confirmed when she pushed and pushed. It less about OP\u2019s honesty and more about the realization she did not live up to her image of perfect bride.\n\nOP, I think you did everything you could to be thoughtful of her feelings. She wanted the unfiltered truth which is why she asked *you*. \n\nIt confirms her fears, and she will be sad for awhile but you are NTA. She\u2019ll get over it. \n\nAnd lastly I hate being lied to. I also don\u2019t lie unless it\u2019s a super specific case (like a child asking if I like their handmade artwork, small stakes and all that). A friend of mine got a tattoo on her neck of her lover\u2019s name after knowing them for two months. It\u2019s big and conspicuous. If she asked me if I thought she was stupid for doing it I would say yes in the absolutely kindest way I could. But she would never ask me because she already knows.", "I would have to answer a guy if he asked me that with  \" Nope you are the first 6 foot tall dick I have ever seen.\"", "OP never said she didn\u2019t look good on her wedding", "She tried and the friend kept pushing", "But why ask about something that you can't change anymore even when the whole world tells you this doesn't look good on you? She should have asked that question BEFORE the wedding not afterwards.\n\nMaybe her friend kept it a secret from everybody and she couldn't say something earlier about it?\n\nJust saying.", "\"Hey, my parents are making me feel bad about my wedding dress. Can you help cheer me up? \"", "Are you 5? Wtf are you gonna do? Go up to your friend during your wedding day and be like \u201cYo I think you could have chosen a better dress?\u201d Whaaaaa?", "Then dont ask for honest opinions.", "I think it's about communication styles. Either you like directness or you prefer niceness and political manoeuvring. As someone who is pretty blunt, even by Dutch standards, I call hard NTA here. Someone asks you for your honest opinion, means you give your honest opinion. I've had this discussion with friends before. It's totally okay for them to disagree with me, or to like things that I don't and vice-versa. That's what makes the world interesting and less monotonous. \n\nJust accept people like different things. Don't let the world revolve around what others think of your decisions, clothes, eyebrows, choices etc in a way that it dictates your life. And if you ask for an opinion, be ready to hear an opinion, even if it isn't what you want to hear.", "I think being honest is a virtue in itself, and doesn't require something to be gained. To me, it seems inappropriate to withhold honesty unless you can see some advantage to telling the truth.", "Yeah op tried to focus on the things she liked about the dress and then was pressed for more of her thoughts. Her friend decided to go digging and then cry about what was dug up.", "Seeing all the kind vs truth opinions are disturbing. Since when is telling the truth unkind? Even if the truth is hurtful it's not unkind to tell it. You can use kind words, which she tried to.", "I would disagree and say being disingenuous is more disrespectful than being honest when asked. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to be giving out unsolicited advice or opinions- another to ask for honesty yet expecting flattery/validation.\n\nThere\u2019s a difference.", "Tbh I think it's pretty clear the friend didn't actually like her wedding dress. She liked the idea of it, and maybe she liked the way the dress looked on the mannequin, but I think she realized at some point that in execution, the dress on her didn't actually look the way she wanted. Instead of being able to accept that she picked the wrong dress, she wants to \"fake it til you make it.\" Which is fine, but don't ask for other people to be honest with you when you can't be honest with yourself.", "This is the funniest thing I\u2019ll see all day.", "This must be new. I was asked this zero times back in the 80s, and I did get around.", "but she didn\u2019t say that she looked bad. She said that to her personally it was not the best choice or she would\u2019ve made a different one. Not that the choice made was overtly bad. Nor does that inherently mean that you didn\u2019t look amazing on her wedding night. Others just have differences of opinions on what they like/preferred. it\u2019s like if i had a birthday party and asked if everyone liked the cake but some didn\u2019t because they prefer a different flavor..i can be upset that\u2019s valid but their preference is also valid. and if they didn\u2019t say it in a mean or hurtful way i should respect that like they respect my decisions to get what i prefer.", "I was really hurt when I found my friends were lying to me to spare my feelings, that\u2019s not what I would call being a good friend. I couldn\u2019t trust those people ever again. \n\nI think that attitude depends of the person though so you have to go by what you know of their personality. Given OP\u2019s description of their friendship I say NTA.", "after someone asks ytou for your honest opinion and continues to bug you for it and you refuse to give your opinion, you are basically saying \"you wont like my opinion so I'm not going to tell you\".... so it's not like it's hard for them to figure out what you think.", "Why ask about it in the first place, when OPs friend can't change it anymore? She has to owe her bad taste choice and live with it, it doesn't matter if others lie/dislike it.", "What do you think telling someone that what they\u2019re wearing isn\u2019t flattering means? Yes, she didn\u2019t use those exact words, but that s what she was telling her.", "This sub. Every time!", "Communication styles is exactly it. It\u2019s about emotional intelligence and reading the room. Everyone has different preferences; you read the room and either you tailor your response to the message recipient. Or you don\u2019t, and decide to be unapologetically yourself regardless of the consequences. Either works, but if you choose the latter, I don\u2019t think you can be surprised if someone who prefers the gentle technique is upset when you don\u2019t respond in turn. Just like they shouldn\u2019t be surprised if they receive a blunt answer when they ask a \u201cblunt\u201d person a question.", "Thank you! I\u2019m Belgian, and I have a lot of Dutch friends because I love their bluntness.", "Right? So many people are equating telling the truth to being a brutal asshole. Being honest and kind are not mutually exclusive.", "She can't go back in time and change what she wore on her wedding though. It's done. A good friend helps preserve the happy memory at this point because the \"truth\" of the OPINION serves no one.", "This is the ticket for me. If the friend loved the dress, what does she care what anyone else thought of it? I'm wondering if maybe *she* was on the fence about the dress and is just now dealing with those feelings. Because personally, if I'm wearing something I absolutely love, I don't care whether my friends like it.", "Yes, totally - sometimes I'm not sure about the look or the fit or whatever. In this case, there are some additional issues of the level of formality/different traditions involved. I mean, sounds like the bride thread a tough needle but people have opinions. They seemed to have a relationship where it was cool to express them. Too bad!", "Yeah, because 3 people told her she looked awful on her wedding day, which isn't something she can go back and change.\n\nWhat's so hard to understand about that?", "I get that! But I feel like this was her wedding day. This was a day where she wanted to feel beautiful and what good would it be to tell her that you thought she didn\u2019t look good?! How does that grow the friendship?! Do you guys ruminate over the fact that she will never get to duplicate that day and wear a dress that you think looks better? OP literally said that she looked unique, but just maybe didn\u2019t find it the most flattering dress for her. It serves no purpose to tell someone that on a day that they\u2019re supposed to be beautiful and the center of attention that you thought they didn\u2019t look good. I want my friends to be honest with me in certain situations. If this was pre wedding I'm all for it, but come on! We're now after the big day all this does is hurt her friend...which it did.", "Right? My girls and I always say if something flatters our features or not. Maybe it's an age thing?", "If a friend said that to me, I'd know she meant it was fugly. I'm guessing OP's friend also knew or suspected, and so kept pressing for a direct answer.", "She kind of did but the friend kept on pushing.", "Exactly!! Though I\u2019m not sure why the friend is so caught up in what others think. If someone didn\u2019t like my dress, I\u2019d tell them \u201cwell it\u2019s a good thing you weren\u2019t wearing it & it wasn\u2019t your wedding.\u201d", "Yeah I dont get this at all. They arent calling you ugly, they aren't calling the dress ugly. Hell, unflattering doesn't even necessarily imply that you have bad taste. The most attractive person in human history will look terrible if they're wearing the most beautiful dress that's 14 sizes too big. That's unflattering", "This is so important. Truth is about timing and care. You can tell someone the truth in a way that isn\u2019t hurtful. People who say they are \u201cblunt and just honest\u201d are usually just assholes who don\u2019t really care about other people, so the \u201ctruth\u201d part isn\u2019t what makes them the asshole. If I ask, give me a real answer. If I don\u2019t ask then don\u2019t give me an opinion. Very simple!", "So for the sake of argument- if that IS true. What good does it do for the friend to agree that the dress didn\u2019t look good? What is the net gain from that action? (Also I hope this doesn\u2019t seem like I\u2019m challenging you- I genuinely am wondering the thinking process)", "Yeah this lady was really pushing for an honest answer and then she didn\u2019t like it.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.", "Exactly.  That was in an edit and many of the commenters may not have seen it.  Sure, would it have been better if OP said, \"why are you asking me this?\" or redirected to the friend's feelings about the parents' comments.  But OP didn't blurt this out  unsolicited and tried to give a positive and diplomatic answer when first asked.  That's a normal and polite thing to do.  The friend was the one who kept pushing it.\n\nUp until I got to the part where the bride dragged in a mutual friend, I was going more with no AHs.  The bride friend isn't an AH for having hurt feelings about this or telling the husband.  The husband is an AH though for getting involved instead of letting the friends settle it on their own by talking.  Unless husband is also friends with OP.  The bride friend became an AH too, IMO when she involved the mutual friend.\n\nI'm wondering if the bride friend even bothered to tell either her husband or the mutual friend that she had pushed for more comments about the dress? And if she didn't, was it because she was too upset to recount it accurately or because it didn't fit her victim narrative she was trying to use to smear OP?\n\nThe former, I'd talk to the person about it and let it go after that.  The latter?  I'd be done, people like that are hazmat level freakin' poison.  And will try to wreck and ruin your life.  But OP knows the situation best, so I'm just going to leave it at asking the questions, because I think OP should at least ask herself those questions.\n\nIt's a nice gesture for OP to initiate an apology, but I hope she asks the friend if she was accurate in her recounting of the story to the mutual friend.  And if OP isn't friends with the husband, I'd also be asking her why her husband is inserting himself into a matter between two friends.  If the bride friend wasn't accurate, she owes OP the truth and telling it to the husband and mutual friend.  And both the husband and wife owe OP an apology.  The wife for the smear and the husband for inserting himself into this.\n\nI also note neither the husband or the mutual friend asked the OP what happened.  I can get the husband doing that, but OP should also be asking the mutual friend that as well.\n\nIt's one thing to say someone sucks and take your spouse's side.  It's another thing to go texting the person your spouse is having a disagreement with.  My understanding is he initiated texting to the friend.\n\nQuite frankly the husband and wife both sound too immature to be married.  They're acting like they're about 10-15 years old.  Comforting her is fine, but she's not 5 and he's not her father or mother.  She needs to grow up.  And the husband is acting like a 13 year old who's going to settle a score for someone he loves.  He needs to grow up as well.", "Exactly.  I don't think I can come up with a single example where I would ask a person a question and then be angry at them for _how they answered_ it.\n\nThe closest thing is something along the lines of me asking my wife or daughter if they loved me, and their answer was \"no\".\n\nI would most likely become very sad, but I STILL wouldn't have the slightest issue with the _answer_.  I respect the answer and wouldn't ever want to be lied to regardless of how it makes me feel. Life is too short to live in an illusion.\n\nHere, someone creates drama over how some other person feels about YOUR OWN CLOTHING.\n\nSometimes I'm just in awe that we share this planet.", "I agree with you in general but then I remember my childhood.  \"It's not flattering\" was my mom's code for \"you look fat\".  She knew I was super self conscious about my weight (I had an eating disorder), and she would use them whenever she just didn't like the style because she knew it would get me to not buy it.\n\nThat being said I don't think OP is the asshole as her friend has a long history of honesty, literally asked her to be honest, and rejected the positive feedback OP tried to give her.", "Seriously! I'm happy to know if something's not flattering - I'll give it away or put it away till I can tailor it or it fits better if that's going to happen. There's no reason to be mean about it but honesty doesn't necessarily equal cruelty!", "I don't think it's about net-gain, really. It's that she asked her good friend to be honest, and OP was. I hope my friends are always honest with me when I ask for their opinion, but *especially* when I specifically ask for them to tell me the truth.\n\nAnd I'm just guessing about the friend feeling insecure because I know I wouldn't be upset that my friend didn't like my dress if *I* loved it. But no matter what the friend was feeling, OP isn't a mind-reader, and it isn't fair for the friend to expect her to lie when she asked for honesty. (I also hope I don't come off combative! It's so hard to tell over text. Lol!)", "I hear you, and that's shitty.\n\nI hope you are surrounded by more loving women as an adult.", "So then telling the truth is okay by default. \n\nIf friend didn't want to entertain the possibility of hearing an opinion that isn't exactly what she wants, don't ask. And especially don't press it when OP tries to give a compliment to spare her feelings. \n\nIf my friends are going to lie and tell me what I want to hear every time I ask for their opinion, it is pointless. I already know what they are going to say, so I don't even need to ask. And even getting the validation or whatever is moot since I know they very well could by lying anyway.", "No I think you\u2019re dead on about the insecurity! And that makes sense to me.

Though I suppose if you fake compliment them enough, you might win, but they may decide it's not sincere enough and still get upset.    \n\n\nJust like people should be diplomatic, I think people asking difficult questions need to know when to back off.  Unless you're trying to solve a murder or figure out if your spouse is cheating or something along those lines.    \n\n\nIt's a movie meet after a wedding, not a police interrogation for a murder.  IMO, it was rude for the friend to keep pushing it once OP gave the diplomatic answer.  And then when she got the answer she was looking for, she want crying to the mutual friend.  I can see crying to the husband, because they're married and all.  I'm also guessing the bride friend left out the part where she kept pushing for an answer. I'd be interested to know if she told her husband and the mutual friend that and if they took it upon themselves to do the bride's bidding or if she asked them.", "Or at least back off once one realizes one is making the other person uncomfortable.  It was a wedding dress, not a murder.  There was no need for the friend to go into interrogation mode over it.  And why is she asking 3 months later?  Sure, vent about the parents being AHs.  That's fine and friends support each other.

IF what she typed is what she said, it was under specific but honest about her own opinion, which was asked for, more than once.", "Yeah, the approach there has to be different. \"My parents said they hated my dress! I'm so upset! But you liked it, right? You thought it was beautiful, right?\" That absolutely should be answered with reassuring pablum.\n\nRepeated requests for a non-fluffy answer, though ... well, I'd assume my friend wanted my real opinion, and I'd give it.

The reality is that I don't know or understand it. I'm not a cruel person, thankfully,  because, in my case, this is an autistic trait. I don't understand willy nilly rules that are selectively enforced, people asking for an honest opinion but not really wanting it, etc. When I have expressed some frustration with having big arms or carrying extra weight, I haven't been wanting reassurance or to be placated.

As far as criticism go, that's the mildest it can get in my opinion.", "We aim to please.", "Is there a point in telling someone that they looked bad on their wedding day when it is in the past, they can't change it, and will never wear the dress again? I agree with being honest when you can effect change, but telling someone that they looked bad in the past and there is nothing they can do to change just puts the \"brutal\" in \"brutal honesty\". Why not kind honesty about something your friend can't change?", "^^^ When I ask my partner to look at my outfit I want his opinion. If he doesn\u2019t like the color combos - too bad.  If it doesn\u2019t *fit* I usually go change.  But I can\u2019t see my own backside, so please just give me the help I asked for!", "And then gets punished for it!", ":(", "True, but people also need to be careful about pressing for opinions they don\u2019t want. If the bride had just come out of the dressing area on her wedding day and asked how she looks, absolutely the time for a white lie unless the issue is immediately fixable. But if you\u2019re going to ask your friend afterwards for their honest opinion, I also feel like that\u2019s on the friend. If I asked, I\u2019d expect and want an honest answer (and I\u2019d be prepared for my friend to say she didn\u2019t like it)."]}
