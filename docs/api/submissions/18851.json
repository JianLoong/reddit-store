{"id": 18851, "submission_id": "13zb6p6", "title": "AITA for telling my friend that I didn't like her wedding dress?", "selftext": "3 months ago I (26F) attended (27F)'s wedding.\n\nHer wedding was a destination wedding at a beach venue.\n\nWhen she arrived, she was wearing a poofy bright red dress, the kind you'll see celebrities wearing at the met gala. It was very unique and she stood out beautifully, but in my opinion, the dress didn't flatter her, nor the venue and I personally didn't like it, but I wasn't gonna be the person to tell her that on her wedding day and ruin the night for her, so the rest of the day was very fun and I had an incredible time with her and all of our other friends.\n\nMy opinion of her dress I kept to myself because I dislike talking behind people's backs and it isn't my place to tell her what she shouldn't have worn, after all, it was her wedding day and she should wear something she feels amazing in, and I noticed that she had an amazing confident aura wearing that dress and I felt amazing for her.\n\nYesterday, she came to my house to watch a movie with me, before we started watching she talked about how her parents told her that her wedding dress didn't look good and that she should've worn a white simple dress (they are a very traditional type). Then she asked me what I honestly thought about her wedding dress, and most respectfully, I told her that while I thought that the dress made her stand out amazingly and it was very unique, in my personal opinion, I wasn't very fond of it and that it did not flatter her. She was quiet for a second then she got up and left, even though I tried explaining to her that I didn't mean to offend or insult her, she left in the end. I tried messaging her but I got no response.\n\nToday her husband messaged me saying that she cried for hours after I met with her, that I was very disrespectful, and that I had no place to criticise her dress. One of her best friends sent me a long message about how while he agrees with me, I didn't have to tell her that because it isn't our place and that I came across as jealous and pathetic.\n\nI don't know what to do or say and I'm having trouble even contemplating whether I was wrong, so what do you think, AITA?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEdit: someone told me to add this comment reply to my post, \n\n\"At first, I told her that she stood out and looked confident and left it at that, but then she asked me \"I didn't ask you if I looked confident or unique, I asked you what you thought about the dress\" I didn't want to lie to her since we've always had a very blunt relationship she's always told me the blunt truth, but keeping in mind that it was obviously a really big day for her I tried to be kind and sensitive about my honest opinion. But I see that I may have been too rude and not considerate of her feelings, thank you for your comment! I'll try to make things right with her if she will give me another chance.\"\n\nBut also guys, seriously thank you so much for actually making me realize I was definitely in the wrong, I didn't really think it through many times in my head and just said what I was truthfully feeling and I understand how wrong it was especially since it was about something she now couldn't change. I've seen a lot of people saying I could have said something before her wedding but I wasn't one of her bridesmaids and she said she wanted to keep everything a surprise, also we've always had a very honest and blunt kind of relationship and she's always told me that she dislikes white lies and if someone asks you something you should always answer it truthfully, this is the woman who told me and my boyfriend of 2 years to break up to our faces because she thought we weren't compatible for each other since he travelled a lot for his work, and although I was upset, looking back I realise that relationship was absolutely going nowhere, this is why I disagree with the comments that say that I should've just lied, I honestly cannot lie to her and lying about something would make me feel guilty. But I completely take responsibility for talking about the negatives when I should've only spoken about the honest positives. I messaged her if I could meet up with her and she replied saying she was thinking of that too, we're meeting each other in a few hours and I'll try to apologise to her and tell her that it didn't matter what I or her parents thought of her dress, if she felt amazing and confident in it, then that was the perfect dress for her. THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, I'll show her this post and will update after I've met with her.

It\u2019s not like she\u2019s getting married every weekend and this is a grievous mistake she needs to stop repeating. Letting her have this would\u2019ve been the right thing to do even if you had to hide your true feelings.", "YTA\n\n>it isn't my place to tell her what she shouldn't have worn, after all, it was her wedding day \n\nYou're right. It's not your place. And on top of that, the dress sounds (in your words) \"amazing.\"\n\n>and she should wear something she feels amazing in, and I noticed that she had an amazing confident aura wearing that dress and I felt amazing for her. \n\nThis is what you *should* have said to your friend. Her parents are being assholes and you piled on for no reason. Keep your lame-ass opinions to yourself.", "YTA.  The place to stop in your comment was right after you said the dress made her stand out amazingly and was very unique.  Did you really not pick up on the social cues that she was looking for reassurance, and not brutal honesty?", "NTA\n\nYou kept your opinion to yourself until she approached you and directly asked for your honest opinion.\n\nIt sounds like you told her your opinion whilst trying not to sound overly mean.\n\nYou could argue that perhaps lying would have been a better idea, but equally, you could argue that lying would be insulting to your friend.\n\nI understand why she's upset, but I don't think you did anything wrong.", "NTA. She has unlocked a life lesson: Don\u2019t ask the question if you aren\u2019t prepared to hear the answer. \n\nThat being said, here\u2019s a tip for you when discussing matters of taste, if you would prefer to avoid situations like these: turn the question back on the asker, and remind them that it doesn\u2019t matter what others think. \n\nHere\u2019s how you could have applied that here:\n\nFriend: \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t like my dress and said it didn\u2019t look good on me. What did you think of it?\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cI\u2019m sorry they said that. Truly, though, it doesn\u2019t matter what any of us thought of your dress. Did you like it?\u201d\n\nFriend: \u201cYes, but do you think it looked bad on me?\u201d\n\nYou: \u201cI think you looked confident and radiant and that it was a beautiful day. How did you feel?\u201d\n\nNotice how I focus on her, and her experience of the day, rather than the dress. I\u2019m helping her channel the good emotions of that day so she can shift more value to that, instead of focussing on the judgements of others. \n\nIf she still pressed you for an opinion, as sometimes happens, you could have responded with gentle honesty. For example, \u201cIt\u2019s not something I would have chosen for myself, but who am I to decide what you should have worn? Respectfully, I wouldn\u2019t let you or anyone else decide what I wore/will wear to my wedding.\u201d", "edited my post with this, seriously thank you so much for actually making me realize I was definitely in the wrong, I didn't really think it through many times in my head and just said what I was truthfully feeling and I understand how wrong it was especially since it was about something she now couldn't change.

So what would a white lie do? \n\nI would probably have focused on the aura of confidence you talked about in your post and that you felt amazing for her. And just try to avoid saying anything specific about the actual dress. If anything, just a comment in there about it being unique and that's probably why her parents said what they said. \n\nI think I'm going NAH, you didn't mean harm, so I'm not going to call you ah for that. but I understand why she got upset too.", "NTA\n\nSounds like you tried to be tactful and respectful with your opinion. The other option was to lie. She asked", "NAH.\n\nHer husband and best friend probably heard a \"worse\" version of the story than what really happened . . . or you're telling a better version of what you said than what really happened.\n\nYou made a mistake; not a major one or anything. And you did try to repair this and all. You all could have handled this better but nobody here's a true asshole; so NAH.\n\nIn the future remember whenever answering questions or giving advice of this type:  \n\n\n1. Is it True?\n2. Is it Kind?\n3. Is it Necessary?\n\nSince it wasn't, you could easily have just said: \"I really dont want to talk about it.\" Or \" Who cares what I think - what did YOU think?\" Or \"Girl the only person whose opinion matters there is \\*yours\\* and I'm happy for you that you wore the dress YOU wanted.\" \n\nSidestep the issue.

You never tell someone they didn't look good in their wedding dress. True or not. Yes she asked for your honest feedback, but you could've left it at it being unique and a stand out, maybe saying that you personally would've gone more traditional but loved how confident she was in the dress she chose. It was never going to do any good telling her you didn't like it.", "NTA. She asked for your *honest* opinion and you gave it to her.", "\u2018I noticed that she had an amazing confident aura wearing that dress\u2019 is what you needed to say.

Telling your friend the truth had no benefit to anyone. You could have just told her the positives and let her be happy.", "NTA-she may have asked for your honest opinion, but she clearly wasn\u2019t prepared for honesty and was upset when you didn\u2019t tell her what she wanted to hear. \n\nI think you need to evaluate if this is someone you want to continue a friendship with. Not only did she have an irrational and immature  reaction to your honesty, but now she\u2019s bringing other people into it and painting you in a negative light. Not cool!", "NTA. Don\u2019t ask for a honest opinion if you can\u2019t handle an honest answer. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffb", "Before the wedding, your honesty would have been constructive criticism, but after the fact, it just becomes an insult. \n\nI don't think you meant to harm your friend but a lesson here, brutal honesty doesn't have to mean sharing your *very worst* thoughts.  You could have just as easily and truthfully said \"You created a stunning moment and were positively glowing in that dress!\"  NAH", "NTA.\nShe asked for your honest opinion. You gave it.", "YTA\n\nLook, I get it, you genuinely didn't mean harm. But you did harm, and it could have been avoided. \n\nI actually agree with all the people saying that you need to \"get better at telling white lies\", BTW. You didn't even need to lie. You just needed to learn to be more careful with your words! As an autistic person who took a LONG time, and (despite being otherwise very intelligent) needed a lot of guidance from friends and family about how to interact appropriately in social settings, one of the first and most important rules that I learned to live by was: \"You don't always need to say all the thoughts in your head out loud.\" \n\nLet me repeat that: Just because you're thinking something doesn't mean that you have to say it. Especially if it's hurtful. You don't have to lie, you just . . . don't have to say the unkind parts. You are still being honest if you just share the GOOD parts of your honest feelings.\n\nNext time, tell her that the dress was striking, unique, and made her stand out from the crowd . . . tell her how beautifully confident she looked in it, and how you're glad that she chose something that made her FEEL gorgeous. And then stop talking. Just stop. Leave it at that.", "YTA you could have simply said \"the only thing that matters is how you felt in that dress. You're the only one that matters and don't worry about what your parents think\"", "YTA learn some tact and learn to be kind. What was the goal of saying this to her? She can\u2019t go back and redo the wedding in a different dress. So you just ruined how she saw the wedding in her mind for what \u2026 being unnecessarily brutally honest?", "YTA. What did you gain from telling her? You knew she was clearly upset that her parents didn\u2019t like the dress. What was the point of making that worse? You didn\u2019t even need to lie, you could\u2019ve just said what you said in the post - that it was unique and made her stand out and she looked so confident. \n\nJust because something\u2019s true, doesn\u2019t mean it needs to be said.", "ESH. you for talking still telling her even if she couldn\u2019t do anything about it anymore and it would only hurt her and her for asking that stupid question. if she\u2019s confident in it she shouldn\u2019t be asking anyone\u2019s opinion on it anymore", "I\u2019m autistic so very direct/honest and social mores are hard for me - but even I know you should never say this.", "Soft YTA. There\u2019s truthful and then there\u2019s tactful. \n\nYou just confirmed that she didn\u2019t make a great choice on what\u2019s supposed to be the best day of her life and she\u2019ll remember that as long as she remembers her wedding day. \n\nYou could have reconfirmed that it was amazing dress and then said she made a bold choice, or some other backhanded compliment which is the truth but not exactly what she was fishing for. \n\nIt\u2019s a bit like a haircut, you don\u2019t tell the person whose wearing the haircut it\u2019s horrible, you point out that the another haircut that was so much better on them but you don\u2019t say how horrible the one they have is or refer yo an old haircut they had that was horrible.", "NTA.\nYour friend told you what other people had said, and asked for you honest opinion. \nSo... Apparently she didn't actually want your honest opinion, despite what she said. I see many people are saying you are TA because... Apparently you're supposed to listen to what people say, except when they've sprinkled a delicate assortment of hints and clues that you're supposed to pick up on? Or do we only tell the truth when we won't hurt someone's feelings?\nThis wasn't an unsolicited opinion. You didn't go around looking for a way to say something hurtful.\n\nIf your friend hadn't wanted an honest opinion, she shouldn't have asked for one. I'm sure there are other ways to get someone to lie to you than to literally ask them not to!\n\nHonestly, it might hurt my feelings when my friends or partner tells me something doesn't look good on me, but I would 100% prefer they tell me honestly, because then I can trust them when they tell me I look good. If they always tell me I look good, even when I don't, then I can't ever be sure that they're being honest.", "YTA. You said so many positive things about her confidence and how great she felt, and that's exactly what you should have told her when she asked how you felt about her wedding dress. She was already having her confidence stomped on by her parents' criticism, and you just piled on. A good rule of thumb is to not criticize if the person can't do anything about it at the time. If she didn't ask you about the dress when she was selecting it, then just hold your tongue.", "YTA. Your friend was looking to you for support. She chose that dress for a reason, and regardless of how anyone else felt about it, it was her day to pick what she wanted. \n\nYou have to remember, that most people don\u2019t see themselves the way others see them. \n\nThe best thing you could have done, and still not lie, was ask how your friend felt in the dress and confirmed with her that was all that matters. Did she feel pretty? Did she have a great time? And most importantly, did she get married? \n\nThis was an opportunity for you to be supportive, even if you didn\u2019t agree with her choice. It would have cost you NOTHING to do that for your friend.", "There are some places to tell the truth--a wedding dress opinion is not one of them.\n\nAccidental YTA", "NTA. She asked for your opinion and you gave it", "NTA. She asked for your honest opinion, she got your honest opinion. When I seek support from someone else, I don\u2019t assume they understand my need; instead, I tell them that I\u2019m in no mood for advice, and I only need their support at the moment.\n\nCould you have done better? Absolutely. But this doesn\u2019t make you an AH.", "YTA\n\nThere's some things that just don't need to be said. Telling her you didn't like her dress served no purpose, she'd already worn it. It just made her feel bad.

Other than making her feel bad.", "Was this information necessary or helpful? .... No\n\nPeople who hide behind \u201cwell they asked me\u201d.... are looking for an excuse to say something they know will be hurtful. There was absolutely no need to say anything but you looked absolutely stunning.\n\nI have no idea why you felt the need to say anything to your friend.

If she asked you directly and you told her kindly and honestly, you did nothing wrong.  I don\u2019t care that it was a wedding dress and \u201cyou never say that to a bride\u201d.

You attempted to be tactful but she kept pressing.\n\nAnd I understand that sometimes you have to bend the truth a little when dealing with close friends\u2019 feelings. But the wedding was three months ago; why is this still an issue?", "NTA. She asked and honesty is the best policy", "NTA.  You were directly asked for your opinion by someone who expected you to provide an honest and candid answer without obfuscation.  To lie to her would be contemptuous of the friendship.  Your obligation was to be truthful, not pump sunshine into her.  She should not have asked a question she did not want an answer to and should not have taken offense when she received what she asked for.", "YTA. It was her wedding dress. You absolutely should have stuck to the beginning of the statement. You radiated confidence and joy. Of course YTA.", "Soft YTA. It's good to be honest but your friend wanted support even if they might not have said that outright. She's going to think about how she apparently looked like a fool on her wedding day for the rest of her life, it could soil the entire event for her out of embarrassment because not only her parents think she looked bad, but even her friends. Sadly, someone should have said something before the wedding but nobody did.", "ESH\n\n**Your friend** because she knew the dress was controversial (at a minimum) at the beginning, and she also knew that her parents didn't like it. So she highly, highly suspected that everyone felt that way, and checked with you. She appeared to want your honesty, but no one in that situation really does... she wanted you to say \"No! You looked \"*amazing and confident*\" and *\"I  felt amazing for you!*\" So you were cornered.\n\n**You,** because the \"blunt honesty\" trick works when it's something a person can do something about, but in this instance - all it did was let her know she looked awful on the one day she wanted to look great .This was absolutely the moment for a white lie, and you were doing awesome all the way through *\"I thought that the dress made her stand out amazingly and it was very unique\"* ....and then you laid in a \"BUT\" right after. \n\nThere are times for absolute honesty, and times to protect a friend's psyche...IMO, this was the latter.", "I usually appreciate honesty, but think on this one I\u2019d have just given her my \u201chonest opinion\u201d on the things that were positive. You thought she looked amazingly confident, and like she stepped out of the met gala.\n\nNo reason to say it didn\u2019t flatter her. She couldn\u2019t fix it, and of course it will ruin her happy wedding memories. Honestly absolutely has a place, but this one was the place to gracefully handle the difficult position you were in with kindness.\n\nESH. She shouldn\u2019t have asked.", "NTA. I've never had a friend ask for honesty and then lie to them. Your friend needs to grow up", "ESH. Given that her parents had already said they didn\u2019t like it she must have known there was a chance other people might think the same, she shouldn\u2019t have asked you for an honest opinion if she wasn\u2019t prepared to hear it. I don\u2019t think what you said to her was that horrible but maybe you should have just left it that personally it wasn\u2019t your style and not said it didn\u2019t flatter her. She shouldn\u2019t be getting her husband involved.", "YTA.\n\nWhat is wrong with you?", "Eh, ESH\u2026 I only say that because your friend knew she had a very non traditional dress on and that most people are kinda traditional when it comes to wedding dresses. She wore a dress she loved but she damn well knew it was going to be a conversation piece. OP sucks because they gave their opinion on a very sensitive topic. Yes, I\u2019m glad you\u2019re honest, everyone should be, but read the room a bit. It\u2019s okay to be like \u201cI loved the confidence you had in that dress, you looked amazing, i personally couldn\u2019t pull off that dress\u201d or something subtle of the dislike for it. Not everything needs the truth, especially if it\u2019s your friends wedding day. She could\u2019ve felt amazing and looked confident but she lowkey knew people were talking and probably got a little insecure. She went to her friend for reassurance and didn\u2019t get it.", "NTA. What are true friends for if not for honest opinions?", "YTA, the dress is her dress, as friend you can only contribute your concern(be nice) if she didn\u2019t listen then don\u2019t bother further! Most brides know what they want, they are just afraid to make mistake. So with this question: honest opinion , they actually do not want the harsh truth in your mind, they just want reassurance.", "NTA\nShe asked for your honesty and you gave it. You gave it in a measured way too, complimentary in that it was a unique dress etc, but honest in that you didn't think it flattered. You could very easily have said \"My god, that dress was horrific, where the hell did you drag it from?\" Alternatively you could have said \"That dress made you look like crap!\" You didn't do that, you answered honestly and now you're getting crapped on by others. I'd step back for a while so she can give her head a wobble", "ESH she shouldn't have asked but I think up until you said it didn't flatter her okay. But you shouldn't have said that it didn't flatter her. Like everything else you said was fine and you could have said you preferred also a white or simple dress but to say it didn't flatter her is mean or rude.", "YTA. You said yourself she had a confident aura yet you chose to say no. You weren\u2019t dress shopping giving your opinion. It was after the wedding day so only positive comments are needed. Consider the friendship harmed if not ruined.", "ESH\n\nShe asked for your opinion when she just wanted reassurance. \nYou gave her your opinion when you should have reassured her. \n\nUntil we invent a time machine, this isn't even an opinion that should be offered or asked for because it's not like she can go back in time and wear something else. So what would asking that question or offering an opinion do?", "YTA, absolutely no good could have come from your honest opinion.", "YTA. Usually I would say that you weren't TA since she did ask but your friend very clearly wanted someone to say that the dress looked nice as she was venting about what her parents said. It would not have been hard to simply say you liked it.", "You knew better than that, it's okay to lie sometimes haha", "YTA she didn't want you to be honest. She wanted you to tell her she looked good.  There is zero reason after the wedding to tell her anything else because it can't be changed. If she had asked you prior you could have been honest", "YTA - if you can\u2019t say anything nice\u2026", "YTA. Completely unnecessary comments from you. Makes me speculate some envy on your part.", "YTA I know she asked for your honest opinion, but this is a time when it\u2019s okay to lie. \u201cIt was beautiful and you looked amazing!\u201d is what you should\u2019ve said. I imagine you\u2019ve broken her heart.", "If she didn\u2019t want the truth, why did she ask? NTA.", "YTA \n\nThere is nuance to someone asking you for your \u201chonest opinion\u201d. She wanted to vent about her clearly judgy parents who would probably not have settled for anything less than their ideal \u201ctraditional\u201d look. You said she felt amazing and at the end of the day that\u2019s what matters. This is one of those times you bite your tongue and reassure a person that they looked amazing (and you would not be lying since you said all the nice things about how she was glowing!).\n\nNot every time you\u2019re asked for honestly you should give it. Judge the moment and context ffs.", "YTA.  Honest opinions are fine for things people can change but unless she has a time machine then telling her the truth was pointless and achieved nothing except hurting her.  You should have kept your mouth shut.", "YTA. She can't wear a different dress now. Your opinion just made her feel even shittier.

It was very unique and she stood out beautifully, but in my opinion, the dress didn't flatter her, nor the venue and I personally didn't like it, but I wasn't gonna be the person to tell her that on her wedding day and ruin the night for her, so the rest of the day was very fun and I had an incredible time with her and all of our other friends. \n\nMy opinion of her dress I kept to myself because I dislike talking behind people's backs and it isn't my place to tell her what she shouldn't have worn, after all, it was her wedding day and she should wear something she feels amazing in, and I noticed that she had an amazing confident aura wearing that dress and I felt amazing for her. \n\nYesterday, she came to my house to watch a movie with me, before we started watching she talked about how her parents told her that her wedding dress didn't look good and that she should've worn a white simple dress (they are a very traditional type). Then she asked me what I honestly thought about her wedding dress, and most respectfully, I told her that while I thought that the dress made her stand out amazingly and it was very unique, in my personal opinion, I wasn't very fond of it and that it did not flatter her. She was quiet for a second then she got up and left, even though I tried explaining to her that I didn't mean to offend or insult her, she left in the end. I tried messaging her but I got no response. \n\nToday her husband messaged me saying that she cried for hours after I met with her, that I was very disrespectful, and that I had no place to criticise her dress. One of her best friends sent me a long message about how while he agrees with me, I didn't have to tell her that because it isn't our place and that I came across as jealous and pathetic. \n\nI don't know what to do or say and I'm having trouble even contemplating whether I was wrong, so what do you think, AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If she does want something then it\u2019s that that she should ask for.

People need to learn to drop topics instead of pushing until they get hurt. That attitude of pressing until the other side says something you didn't want to hear is what created the situation. Ask for what you actually want and if that's reassurance, just say it.", "Same difference. Some clothes accentuate a person\u2019s good qualities and others don\u2019t.", "Right? Like...even \"It was wearing *you* a bit, it didn't show you to your best advantage\" would be better than that. If OP's defense is that she wanted an honest critique of the dress, stick to blaming the dress.", "you are the hero we didn\u2019t know we needed but did. grats to you sir, for accumulating so much wisdom and to be so kind as to share that with us.", "Apparently, it\u2019s too hard for me. If someone asks for my \u201chonest\u201d opinion, then I\u2019m going to give it to them. I would rather have no friends than friends to don\u2019t have mature emotions.", "I have no patience for women who are critical of the way other women dress. The bride was just living her best life in a dress she chose because it made her feel beautiful.\n\nTrue friends wouldn\u2019t do this to each other. Women in general shouldn\u2019t do this to each other. Let the woman have one day, her wedding day where she isn\u2019t being judged by the rest of the world for the way she looks!!!", "With this attitude, there will be a lot of rocks on your way. Because you only considered to answer the question but haven\u2019t thought about the Intension behind the question, which is equally important.", "The bride wanted a yes or no answer. She got it,", "I agree that no one is forced to share opinions, but bride was actively asking for OP to share opinions. \n\nThat\u2019s why OP had to be honest. The reason to say something was because the bride asked. Who cares? Clearly the bride. Because the bride asked. That means that they care. That\u2019s why them asking isn\u2019t an excuse to hide behind.", "True.  I bet she\u2019s pleased!", "I understand that. I know it\u2019s quite a common thing. I don\u2019t like it as a trait but I recognise that it\u2019s common. My point was though, that you\u2019re saying that friend was asking for support some way, even if not outright. When in fact she was not saying anything about what she was actually asking for. Which again is common, but not what you\u2019ve described up there.", "What an odd comment.", "She obviously was looking for reassurance.", "No you\u2019re right it isn\u2019t. However my point is about asking and answering of questions. That\u2019s not something that\u2019s exclusive to opinions. So why does it matter that ice cream isn\u2019t the same as an opinion?", "Asking an opinion is asking an opinion. Also, no one should ask for an honest opinion if they aren\u2019t prepared for an honest answer. They are both adults and should be able to handle something so small and necessary in a friendship\u2026honesty. No one should need to be coddled so much that they have to be lied to in order to handle life, and definitely not from their friend.", "If nobody would make that request then that\u2019s very much a problem. That\u2019s what they want so they should be able to ask for it. Otherwise they\u2019d have to be content with not getting it. If you don\u2019t ask you don\u2019t get. \n\nIt can only be obvious if she outright says it. That\u2019s the definition of obvious. You can\u2019t call something that OP has to imply obvious because then it wouldn\u2019t be implicit.", "That\u2019s the part that got me to think YTA. You can say you dont particularly like the dress. She asked, but you don\u2019t have to imply that the dress was bad AND she specifically looked bad in it. OP should\u2019ve/could\u2019ve said \u201cit\u2019s not the dress I would\u2019ve picked for myself, but you looked super unique and confident\u201d", "I just read that comment actually and no if she really said that then it\u2019s really no surprise the friend was able to clock that she wasn\u2019t telling the whole truth right from the get go.\nLike if fibbing or trying to skirt a around a question that really only has a yes or no answer to it are skills, OP has zero points in them.", "\\*smirk\\* OK - that made me lol **hard**. Take my upvote :)\n\nJoking aside though - I know you're saying it cynically - but man the world would be SUCH a better place if we showed everyone the love, mercy, empathy and kindness we usually reserve for toddlers.\n\nDont get me wrong - still put them in 'timeout' (eg: give consequences) - but do it from a place of love and understanding.\n\nKid on a roadtrip starts whining - \"Poor thing, he must be so cooped up bored and hungry. Lets try to help him while admonitioning his bad behavior.\"\n\nAdult on a roadtrip starts acting up - \"ASSHOLE! Man up!\"", "It takes nothing to not be an asshole, OP could have phrased her opinion in a nicer way, she didn't and thus hurt her friend, who was already feeling a bit down.", "Damning with faint praise.", "What does it mean when someone doesn\u2019t look flattering on you? It means it looks terrible. Stop pretending they\u2019re not expressing the same sentiment.", "So lie. It doesn\u2019t matter if she keeps wrongly thinking she looked good.", "I think you have the wrong idea on what being mature means. \nBut I mean you do you I guess.", "You are wrong. Her true friends would have gently guided her away from it rather let her look foolish.", "If you can't handle the truth don't ask for it.\n\nWTF is wrong with people to need to be coddled so much.\n\nAnd WTF is wrong with people to defend that shit.", "Maybe it's because I'm the person people tend to go to for this bullshit, but I've run out of pleasantries. If someone asks my opinion, they are getting it with some sugar coating but I'm not lying.", "You'd have to be an idiot to not realize what she wanted.", "You seem like a good person and that\u2019s probably why you have friends and I don\u2019t lol. I\u2019m just too honest for people. But only when asked.", "Don\u2019t ask for an opinion if you don\u2019t really want it. It\u2019s called maturity.\n\nWe have almost the same username lol", "I would not be able to do that either with my close friends.", "Thats fair, I would probably lie ot just say something kinda noncommittal. It sounds like they have a very honest and upfront relationship though.", "Why are ya\u2019ll so comfortable lying? You know most people don\u2019t lie to their friends? Right?", "I\u2019m going to keep doing me. You\u2019re welcome to explain if you feel like you know something about maturity.", "100% agree. No one should have to lie to their friend. If my friend asks, I\u2019m going to be an adult and answer. I\u2019m a blunt person and my friends would never expect me to be someone else for their comfort, so if they expect me to coddle them\u2026that\u2019s completely a \u201cthem\u201d problem.", "Yes I agree. But that\u2019s not because it\u2019s obvious. It\u2019s because it\u2019s become so common for us to recognise the very unobvious things that people are actually saying. We\u2019re so used to it now that you\u2019d be the odd one out if you didn\u2019t get it. But again that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s obvious. \n\nIt would be obvious if people said \u201cplease say my dress looked nice\u201d as you suggested. That\u2019s asking. And as I say if you don\u2019t ask you don\u2019t get. People do tend to give but that\u2019s not really what they should be doing in cases like this.", "Sorry for expecting kindness from a friend?\n\nIf a friend asks your opinion about a dress, and you think she looks terrible, you don't like the color or the shape of the dress, you could choose to say two things:\n\"Personally it's not my style but you look super confident in it, it suits you\"\nOr\n\"That dress is horrible, you look pale and the shape makes you look like a muffin\"\n\nYou'd be more honest with the second opinion, you would also be an asshole. You don't get to say something horrible to someone and then claim they are not \"mature\" enough to handle your honesty.\n\nCool username btw.", "Yes, I see that.  I think OP got it wrong here though.", "What is the OP say that was horrible?", "\"I am not fond of the dress and it didn't flatter you\" \nThat's the dress she wore to her wedding that she was a bit insecure about because of her parents, that was an asshole move.", "That\u2019s not horrible; it\u2019s honest. Being horrible would say something like the dress look terrible or made her look fat or whatever. Your statement is hyperbolic. Don\u2019t ask for someone\u2019s honest opinion if you can\u2019t handle it."]}
