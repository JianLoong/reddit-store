My wife and I both said how great it is. Brother's girlfriend makes the comment that it doesn't seem like the chores were evenly split, mentioning that I was doing laundry and breakfast.\n\nMy wife got defensive, asked what she was getting at. Brother's girlfriend said that to her, it seems like I do more than my wife, then proceeded to point out she didn't wake up until nearly noon.\n\nMy wife proceeded to roll her eyes and told my brother's girlfriend that she's upset because she's just not very pretty. Brother's girlfriend asked if I was going to say something to my wife.\n\n My point to the girlfriend was, maybe it wasn't a great idea to go down the path of the \" chores\" topic. I explained that we both keep our place running and, it just so happens that while I've never really been able to sleep in, she can & does.\n\nThe rest of dinner was awkward, my brother called me later on, asking me why I defended by wife's comments.

In this case that something was seeing which of you would defend their bad behavior more even if it meant bad blood between family members that are also important people in your lives. It's an immature, gross thing to do and women who engage in it are often controlling. I've had women start to try this with me when they and I were both hanging out with our partners when I was younger. That's how I recognized the intent behind the behavior. \n\n It's great to support your partner, but your idea of whether what someone did is okay or not shouldn't rely on how close you are to them. If you defend bad behavior just because the person who did it is close to you, that's morally bankrupt. Your situation is a small scale example, but it's also the same basic principle that makes a woman defend a partner who molested a niece/nephew or a person who tries to hide the action of a loved one who murdered someone. Your idea of right and wrong shouldn't changed based on how close you are to the person who acted out. That's why you aren't exempt from the ESH, either.", "NTA.

If I\u2019m married, regardless of who to and what gender, I would want chores to be split evenly. It would be weird if the wife continuously slept in and the husband did most of the chores. As I\u2019ve written, this is regardless of gender. A couple should share the chores, whether man or woman, man or man, or woman and woman. However, if the wife has a job that keeps her up late and she physically cannot or has some emotional issue that leads her not to be able to do part of the housework, completely understandable. \n\nAlso, not going to lie, it is somewhat rude to not be awake when you have guests in your home that you have invited over.\n\nEdit: Also\u2026 I don\u2019t think the girlfriend said that. She asked if it was strange why his wife slept in and he did all the chores. I don\u2019t know if it was about gender, or a question as to why one person in the couple is doing all the work and the other is not. It does not have to pertain to gender at all actually, there\u2019s only the assumption that it does.\n\nDouble Edit (lol): The husband actually says that the girlfriend wondered why the chores weren\u2019t even split. Not that the wife should be doing all the chores and he shouldn\u2019t. She asked why they didn\u2019t seem split.

If I was working a late shift or something of the sort, then yes I am going to sleep in because that is for my health and that is more important. If that was how it was for the wife, more power to her too and she deserves that rest! But if I made the decision to just sleep in without any prior reasoning to, then ehhh yeah a little rude.", "Seriously, like god forbid a man do two chores in a house he lives in", "> And I am saying I disagree, at best maybe it was a poorly thought through joke but at worst it was incredibly rude and out of line.\n\nIf you think that socially making an observational wisecrack is \"poorly thought-through\" then you don't understand much about the complexity of social interaction.\n\nYou can't make an accurate judgement on the sole basis of the literal words that were spoken. Tone and context can completely change the meaning of what someone is saying. There's a world of difference between irony or playful banter and straight-faced insults."]}
