You went though great lenghts to correct a very embarassing mistake in the most discreet way. I don't see how else you could have done this, unless you just didn't try to correct him.", "NTA. It's good you spoke up, but probably would have been better saying it to him directly. \n\n\"Hey boss, I know you didn't mean anything by it and I understood what you were trying to say, but just so you're aware what you said is actually a sex act and some people might be upset by it.\"", "NTA and no you should not have just let it go.  However you probably should have mentioned it to him directly at the time", "NTA, it's not like you got mad and screamed at him about it. You handled it in a professional way to help him save face.", "NAH - I\u2019ve actually experienced almost this EXACT scenario - I didn\u2019t correct my boss pretty much because he works totally remote and we\u2019re a very small company, I figured it wouldn\u2019t become an issue. Only thing I\u2019d add, is that I\u2019m guessing the irritation you detected may have been embarrassment or just seriousness - with my boss I\u2019ve often found that he is focusing so much on getting the English right that the emotions behind the words can be tough to decode sometimes. I say don\u2019t over think it, everyone is going to forget about it in a couple days.", "NTA - that sort of error is okay to point out because it has a COMPLETELY different meaning than what he intended - but waiting a week and trying to separate your name from it is the wrong way to go about this sort of thing. Just saying something at the time something like \u201cjust so you know, that word actually has a different meaning in English that wouldn\u2019t be appropriate at work!\u201d and emphasising that you weren\u2019t offended or upset by it would have sufficed. Could have given him the opportunity to look it up, learn from it and move past it then and there, maybe even have a laugh about it. \n\nI agree with you that languages, especially English, can be frustrating and bamboozling for non-native speakers - it gets really frustrating that you can\u2019t speak as clearly as you can in your mother tongue which you have mastered. It can ding the ego a bit when someone corrects you, but I was always ultimately grateful when someone did it for me when I lived overseas. \n\nI think by waiting for a week before raising it and then getting another manager involved makes it look like you\u2019re making it a bigger deal than it is, and also it\u2019s kind of annoying/frustrating from his perspective - he made a mistake with a single word and it\u2019s being followed up a week later? My first question would be \u201cwhy didn\u2019t OP just say something to me at the time?\u201d", "NAH He was probably just embarrassed. \n\nWait, maybe he actually wanted a handjob.", "Well I get it. If I was the bos I would be so grateful but if he doesn't like being corrected then I get his attitude. I think he may be a little irritated but still is glad. I would tell him personally. Right after the conversation. Something like. Hey boss, I know English is not your first language but you are great and I understand you, I just want to let you know so you not find yourself in an awkward situation someday... You should Google a word hand job cause it has a different meaning. I know what you meant, it's just English. Pff.\nSomething like that. I would tell him. You know maybe this was why he was irritated? That you didn't help him ta the moment and instead told another person about it... Maybe. I don't know any of you. So NTA but you could be discrete about it, tell him eye to eye.", "NTA. Sounds to me like he\u2019s more embarrassed than angry. I\u2019m sure he doesn\u2019t like being corrected, but it would have been much worse for him if he had kept using that expression without knowing what it meant", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I wonder if you would have gotten a different response if you'd just said to him that you understood what he meant, but that he'd accidentally used an offensive phrase. Bringing someone else into it likely increased the embarrassment factor significantly, and that makes YTA.", "Thank you \ud83d\udc95 yeah I didn't want to embarrass him, but I also didn't want him to embarrass himself, but he seems like he thought I was too nitpicky", "Maybe, I was just anxious and thought the assistant manager might be better at phrasing it. I also wanted my complaint to be anonymous but that didn't end up happening", "Yeah, I just was pretty anxious and figured the other manager might be better at bringing it up, I also wanted to keep my name out of it but that didn't end up happening", "Thank you \ud83d\udc95", "Yeah maybe, I guess I'm pretty anxious so I might be reading into it too much, he just definitely seemed annoyed but it might've just been embarrassment", "Yeah, but he did seem kind of annoyed at me\n\nAnd lol I guarantee he did not", "Yeah, I'm just kinda anxious and wasn't comfortable telling him directly, and I thought the other manager might have a better way of bringing it up.

I have also never heard the term \"machine job\" in any shop I've worked in, so that would also have me raising an eyebrow", "So like I said in the post, I asked the assistant manager because I wanted the comment to remain anonymous. That didn't end up happening in the end, but that was my initial intention, as I felt she would be better at addressing the issue than I would", "It seems you boss wants his cake and eat it too. Either you correct him and avoid a very embarassing future situation and he gets a little embarassed by not knowing what a handjob is, or you don't correct him, he avoids getting corrected by his employee but risks being majorly embarrassed in front of people way, way less understanding than him. Can't have both!", "yeah I can understand that. Going through HR would have been better, if possible. The asst manager was kind of TA here for giving your name if you told them you wanted it to be anonymous.", "Since he presumably only used the phrase with you, he would have known who was bringing to someone's attention anyway. I understand being anxious, but there really was no way to keep you out of it, even if the manager never mentioned you.", "He might have been annoyed at himself and deflecting a bit - that was an embarrassing thing to find out you\u2019re saying, especially to a young employee.  Some people deal with embarrassment by getting annoyed, it\u2019s not nice but it\u2019s not rare.  If you let it rest, it\u2019ll probably go away pretty quickly.", "Well, if I were him, I'd be glad someone corrected such a faux pas. If he turns out to be one of those \"I'm right all the time so don't correct me\" bosses, let him misspeak next time. He won't very far without constructive criticism.", "Haha this is truee", "Yeah, I don't remember if I mentioned I wanted it to be anonymous or not but that was my intention. HR seemed a little more extreme, especially considering another commented is saying I'm TA for involving another person at all", "He probably didn't. It is a tailor shop so talking about handstitching does come up a lot", "Okay, thank you \ud83d\udc95 hopefully he forgets about it soon haha", "Haha yeah, that's fair I suppose. Thank you!", "If he continues to make you feel badly for speaking up, then I don't think going to HR is extreme at all. He made a sexual remark to you (unknown, but still), and then is upset with you for speaking up. Definitely HR material.", "NAH, as long as you\u2019re not correcting him regularly it should blow over. That\u2019s phrasing that should definitely be brought up.", "Hmm maybe, if it gets worse I'll think about it but I'm not sure that it will"]}
