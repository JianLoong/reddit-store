He's single and lives alone in his apartment.\n\nSo to give you the headsup, my wife and him don't get along so well. But can be civil enough to sit at the same table.\n\n\nSo, we went and had dinner and talked and everything was going well, no argument nothing til after my wife went to use the bathroom. Later my brother went to use the bathroom then came back looking pissed. He kept giving me and my wife looks but I didn't know what was going on til he pulled me aside before we left and told me that my wife had left her used pad in his bathroom. I was shocked and didn't know what to say because this felt highly inappropriate. He said he didn't appreciate what my wife did and that it was a sign of disrespect towards him. I apologized profoundly and said I didn't know about it. He asked me to speak to her or she wouldn't be welcome in his place anymore.\n\n\nWe got in the car and I asked my wife about it, she nonchantly said there was nothing wrong with what she did and that my brother was being ridiculous. I kind of flipped and told her it was very inappropriate for her to leave her used pad in his place even if it was in the bathroom and in the trashcan because it made him uncomfortable. She yelled asking what she was supoosed to do and I told her she could've took it with her and threw it outside not in his bathroom -- that's my brother's place and he told me how he felt about it. She yelled at me calling my brother an incel and me an asshole for \"getting in her face about it\". She said she needed to use the bathroom and it's not like the pad was vidible since she dumped it in the trashcan.\n\n\nAt home we still argued about it and she kept on calling me and my brother names. She's currently not speaking to me and is avoiding me entirely. Regardless, I feel like it's his place and he gets to express what makes him uncomfortable in it.\n\n\nEDIT. I can't give info or expand on what was seen but I can tell you that the trash can does not have a lid. It's not like one of those trashcans that have a lid on top and you can push it. What I want to emphasize on is the fact that as guests we should respect people's homes and not argue about what makes them uncomfortable. He said it made him uncomfortable and that should, in my opinion, be acknowledged.", "created_utc": 1667652515, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymt09m/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_leaving_her_used/", "score": 14561, "replies": ["#Post locked due to excessive uncivil comments.\n\nSorry OP.\n\n\nPlease review our [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq) if you're unsure what that means.", "Please walk me trough the logic here like I'm five, cause you lost me.

A purse that contains items she uses everyday like her cellphone and wallet and keys?\n\nEveryone here is a weird gross asshole except your wife.\n\nEDIT - I see the edit about the trash can not having a lid. It literally doesn\u2019t matter. The trash is where it\u2019s supposed to go. If he can\u2019t tolerate pads in the trash, then he shouldn\u2019t have people who menstruate over at his house.", "It\u2019s seems you and your brother do not understand feminine hygiene- let me break it down:\n\nPeriod comes roughly ever 28 days and lasts for about 5 days. During that time, the flow of blood leaving our body is not something anyone can control. Some days it\u2019s heavy, some days it\u2019s light. Now imagine, blood leaving your body from your crotch for a second, and you have zero control of how much at any certain time. If you wanted to live a normal life during this time well\u2026you\u2019d need something to cover the flow: pad, tampon, cup- anything to make it more comfortable. And so you choose the pad, probably because you don\u2019t want to stuff anything in your genitals. But now you\u2019re essentially wearing a diaper. A diaper that collects blood. So when that pad gets full of blood, it\u2019s very similar to a diaper full of other bodily fluids. It\u2019s uncomfortable and if  you leave it on any longer the contents will soon overflow causing clothes and potential furniture to stain. So what do you do? Get rid of it! Where? In a bathroom waste bin- like you would any other object that can\u2019t go in the toilet but is used for our body maintenance, wash cloths, wet wipes, diapers, etc. especially because\u2026 it\u2019s BLOOD so you need somewhere to put it, carrying it is a BIO HAZARD. But hey, you probably would throw bloody napkins after a cut from a knife out in a bathroom trash bin as well, wouldn\u2019t you? So you throw it a way in the trash can that is designed for it. You put on a new pad. And while you\u2019re still not great cause you have blood still leaking from your body without any control, at least you feel cleaner than you did a minute ago. \n\n\nYTA. And you have no idea what half the population deals with. That\u2019s kinda lacking on your part. So do better.", "YTA. You, what, wanted her to shove the bloody pad into her bag or her pockets? She's right, your brother needs to grow up. If he's dated, ever, I'm sure this isn't the first time he's had a bloody pad in his trash. And if this is how he reacts to it, no wonder he's single. If you can't understand why you're being ridiculous, you'll soon be single as well.", "YTA. What is she supposed to do with it? The only reasonable thing to do is throw it out. If she didn\u2019t wrap it up in the wrapper from the new one or toilet paper to make it more discreet you could ask her to do that but do you think it would have been better for her to carry it around the house for the rest of the visit? I suggest no longer going to your brother\u2019s house if trash cans are off limits.", "Hahahhahahahhahahhhhhh you\u2019re joking right? This can\u2019t be real. I mean what person treats their wife like that in this day and age, can\u2019t be real unless you\u2019re twelve. YTA and so is your brother but great job in helping him bully your wife. Hope she realises what you are soon and divorces you. And please tell me you don\u2019t have daughters? You can never be around young women with an attitude like that.", "Throw it outside? Do you even understand what menstrual pads are made of?\n\nI'm assuming she put it in the bin, and didn't stick to the wall as a trophy.\n\nThis is so utterly ridiculous and frankly misogynistic.

You\u2019re basically both annoyed about someone putting rubbish in a bin. WTF?", "Your brother went snooping in the trashcan . Damn! YTA and so is your brother.

Your a married man for god's sakes what is wrong with you? That's what trash is for and who's wrong your wife dealing with a normal body function or your brother that went digging thru trash to find the used pad?

Ugh. \n\nYour brother, ok its his place and he is allowed to be as weird as he likes. But that doesnt apply to you. No wonder your wife is avoiding you. Its clear you dont have her back - even in a situation where she has done nothing wrong. \n\nAll you can do is try to find an apology abject enough that she wont resent the crap out of you for some time to come.

Really? \nYta", "YTA.  And for 31 your brother is incredibly immature.  So are you.  She was supposed to stick a used pad in her pocket on her person till when exactly?

Either you're completely out of touch with reality and you have some serious issues with hating women, or this story is made up. Why aren't you creeped out that your brother went through the trash?

Throwing away a pad or a tampon in the bathroom garbage is a reasonable action and not a sign of disrespect. \n\nIf I was your wife, the next time I went to your brother's house, I would make a big deal out of bringing my used pad out of the bathroom in a clear ziploc bag and swinging it around until I found my purse to put it in to dispose of later.

Walk around with a bloody pad in her pocket or handbag? Oh, walk into the living room, used pad in hand, asking for a plastic bag so she could take it with her out of the house when she left? Like. *She put it in the trash*. \n\nWhat kind of men are these :( makes me feel so blessed all the men in my life didn\u2019t act like my period was somehow there to ruin their lives.
