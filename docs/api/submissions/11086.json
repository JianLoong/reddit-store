Recently he asked if we can go on a date-night to a fancy restaurant close by I told him I would think about it cause I was busy taking care of our son, later he came up to me and asked again I told him no and as a response he told me I was \u201cinconsiderate\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t care about his needs\u201d I responded by pointing out I was taking care of our baby and we have to save money for diapers and formula (I can\u2019t breastfeed) and money for essentials since our pay isn\u2019t the best but still enough for the three of us. Ever since I\u2019ve said no though he\u2019s been behaving with an attitude and acting like our baby. If I ask him a question he\u2019ll ignore me until I repeat myself and if I ask him to do something for me such as clean the counter or wash the dishes he\u2019ll wait until like a hour later to do so. I\u2019ve tried to confront him about it but every time I do he blows it off and says it doesn\u2019t matter anymore when it clearly does. It wasn\u2019t until yesterday that I had enough of his behavior and finally told him why I said no. I explained how although he works from home he manages to make little time for changing our son\u2019s diapers, feeding him, and spending quality time with him which only puts more responsibility on me when I return from a long day of work. Not to mention the restaurant he was talking about going to is extremely expensive which would have us pay money we do not have and instead need for bills, the baby, etc. When I yelled at him for this he then talked about how he never wanted this baby to begin with and therefore it\u2019s not his responsibility. We yet have said a word to each other but the neglect towards our son continues and even though he hasn\u2019t asked since the first day he brought my answer is still no until he steps up and gets his act together. I\u2019ve told my friends about the situation as well but so far one has only told me maybe it\u2019s time to quit my job to handle the baby and all the others have said something along the words of \u201cthat\u2019s men for you\u201d or \u201che\u2019s a busy man\u201d. I\u2019m stuck. Our relationship is in a bad place and I\u2019m scared that I may have to end up divorcing him which is the last thing I need right now.

He never wanted the baby in the first place? I don\u2019t mean to pry, but was this unplanned, pregnancy creating strife before the child?

I\u2019ve a strong feeling I know what he is going through - and thought you may think it wrong or unjustified, it wouldn\u2019t make it any less real.\n\nHaving a baby is tough. Nobody ever seems to want to admit that. It is tough on one\u2019s self, it is tough on your spouse and it is tough on your relationship. It\u2019s stressful, sleep patterns are gone, old habits and schedules are gone, **and the ability and time to focus on yourself, on each other, or your relationship is gone**. Babies are the greatest joy, but they are also an incredible workload, and stress point of a relationship sometimes too.\n\nI will openly tell you I felt some of the same after our first was born - there was no me, or more importantly, us time anymore, and I wanted just a touch of it to be there. *It is very likely he misses that, and would like to rekindle a little of the couple piece of you being a couple.* \n\nDon\u2019t shoot the guy down for trying to rekindle a bit of that. It takes a back seat by necessity for the next 20 years of your life. Making \u201cus\u201d time will be tough and sporadic. All the more important to take some needed moments to recognize and cherish the love that brought that baby here in the first place.\n\nNAH\n\nWish you the best with the new bundle of joy!", "YTA....1st it seems your husband didn't want the baby and that should gavr been a dicusision.. 2nd working from home doesn't mean let me watch the baby.

Even though he should be helping more, many times men feel neglected by their partners after the birth of a baby. Perhaps he would give more effort if he felt wanted.  You and I or anyone else on Reddit will never know.", "Agreed.  It's best for OP to divorce rather than stay \"for the baby\" though.  No child should **ever** grow up having a parent who resents them.", "Exactly. There is missing info. Did wife get pregnant on the sly to force the marriage?  How long have they been  married?", "As a mother of a small child who went through this in the past couple of years, I have a bit of an idea, at least from the point of view of the mom. But you're right, we can't do anything but speculate.", "As a dad who went through this with my first son and my ex, as far as my ex forgetting about me, I have some experience as well. For the record, I did share with parenting, household chores, working, etc. Just don't want you to think I'm some jaded guy.", "Understandable! I just know when I'm completely swamped with childcare and am touched out after a long day, the last thing I want is to be on a date, lol. It's an occasional hiccup in my marriage still. Being a parent is so rough, man.", "Nta but you are a single mother so start planning and acting accordingly. Try not to burn bridges on your way to family court because you will DEFINITELY need a custody agreement- he\u2019s going to be very difficult when it comes to child support. I can smell the dead beat stank from here.", "NTA. But divorce is hard but you man end up happier in the long run with out him there.", "NTA.  \nAlso, this is a moment in your life where you need to figure out your priorities. A man who acts like a child, or your actual child. I'm so sorry this is happening to you.", "NTA. Don't quit your job, quit that useless man!", "NTA. The baby is here. Therefore your husband has the responsibility to parent. I was at first going to say that it's important to make time for your spouse. However, his claim that he's not responsible for the child pisses me off so badly! If that's how he feels, he needs to kick rocks.", "WOAH this is beyond Reddit. This requires professional help from a marriage counselor, therapist and a lawyer. Loop in both sets of grandparents because if the money is tight now, daycare is impossible. \n\n\nAs is, you are basically a single mother and need to move accordingly to set up your support system. That man is neither a father nor husband.", "It sounds like you two weren't on the same page when you got pregnant. Don't quit your job because you will probably be divorced soon.", "NTA- you need a new partner and new Friends", "NTA\n\nThat's a deadbeat dad.", "NTA. And you absolutely need to set boundaries sooner rather than later. You could probably benefit from some marriage counseling. Good luck.", "Why are you raising two children?", "NTA. There is no way in hell I\u2019d stay w a person who neglected my child number 1. Number 2. then states I never wanted a baby in the first place. 3. Resorts to acting like a child because I told them no. I\u2019d separate and give him and myself some space. It\u2019s much easier to deal with a baby if you aren\u2019t dealing with a grown baby. Grown baby\u2019s just add to your mental exhaustion. Trust me. \n\nYou may need a divorce. But but but first see if he will go to therapy. Maybe he has PPD. Men do get that. And he may need counseling to help him through it. \n\nI hope it\u2019s PPD and this is not just who he is. Believe me your kid is better off without a neglectful parent.", "This is HUGELY important. Either way OP should actually leave because regardless of what happened, having her son grow up with a parent who doesn\u2019t care for him is going to be significantly detrimental. \n\nThe judgement hangs onto what exactly happened for OP to have a kid if husband didn\u2019t want one.", "And she should also keep in mind, that when the divorce happens, it's very likely he will become of the 'deadbeat' variety, rarely taking visitation, or finding a naive, young bangmaid/nanny (we see it all the time on reddit) to take care of HIS child.  But first, he'll talk the talk, about how he always wanted more time and you didn't allow it, and he's the victim of the corrupt/unfair legal system that is anti-dad....he'll then get her to run the efforts to start a court proceeding, do the extensive legwork for his court case, turn her against the OP, and once he gets more time and possibly CS thrown out or reduced, he will leave all child responsibility to his new bangnanny, and when she starts getting angry and resenting him, he will start slacking on taking his visitation time and will scapegoat the evil stepmom, which society will be happy to back him up on.\n\nWe have seen this story many, many times.\n\nGranted this happens often, and we also see the reverse, the typical golden uterus mom and caring dad that gets screwed, but I'd say one scenario happens more than the other ;)", "NTA but if you weren\u2019t using condoms and you also weren\u2019t on birth control then I don\u2019t get how you are shocked by a pregnancy, especially at 28.", "You really have to stop calling this baby an accident. It wasn't. It was the let's bury our heads in denial and pretend pull out is reasonable.\n\nThere was no birth control. You are old enough to know how babies happen. You trusted him is not logical reasoning for the pull out method. Y T A for that part and not insisting on no glove no love or one of you using birth control methods. \n\nAs for the rest, if he's truly doing his part during the day watching the baby it sounds like you're both frustrated. Working from home is still work and trying to watch an infant while doing that is difficult too. \n\nHis comment is horrible, unjustifiable. He is TA for that. \n\nBut overall, y'all sound like you need to grow up a bit more and get some professional help. Like daycare or sitters. And all the counseling.", "The baby was not an accident. A conscious choice not to use protection is saying you are willing to get pregnant if it happens. That\u2019s how it works. Your husband\u2019s refusal to condom was in fact the cause of the baby. It\u2019s his \u2018fault\u2019.", "> He never told me he didn\u2019t want a baby, he always insisted he didn\u2019t need a condom so in all honesty our baby was an accident.\n\nNeither of you ever talked about having a child?... acted ignorant to biology, went your whole pregnancy, birthed a child, and are just now finding out he doesn't want the kid? \n\nWhat do you actually *know* about your partner?

Reflect back on them. \n\nThe relationship is dead. Time to start fresh.", "Getting pregnant was an accident. Having the baby was a choice.

I wanted to defend you 100pct here, because you spoke of doing everything for the home and baby, but then say he's caring for your guy's son all day, so not sure how to assume he does nothing, you do it all...", "Ok, but do you not bear responsibility for your own reproductive choices?  You act like it's a foreign concept, you 'trusted' him at 28yrs old to never fail at his method, you never talked about kids?  You guys are not teenagers/early 20's, you all are older, married and of child-bearing ages, how this didn't come up seems like absolute hogwash. \n\nIf he was 'fine at first' it absolutely could just be he spoke horribly out of line because he is frustrated and overwhelmed, though never right to say that, humans do mess up.

(In another comment, OP makes it sound like it was just the pull out method.)  Even if she was using birth control, they should had that conversation instead of just playing the pregnancy version of Russian Roulette.", "Ok, but seriously, why on earth wouldn't you discuss if you wanted children when you got married, that is a massive failure on both your parts.  Did it come up when you got pregnant, so you could have made an educated choice to pursue the pregnancy or not?\n\nI will say this, if he is watching the child when working from home, then he indeed IS contributing to raising the child/caring for what, minimum of 9-10 hours a day (if you work full-time/commute).  It's next to impossible to work and care for an infant, so perhaps he has a very flexible schedule, but that means he feels he does the majority of care during waking hours, so it's fair to ask you to do it when you return.  \n\nIf he is working from home all day with the baby, it's not unusual/wrong for him to want a break and do something fancy/nice for himself and or you both as a couple, it's super important to maintain the spark and keep time for you both as well as the child.  Would he have compromised for a less expensive place?  \n\nThe thing is, his one comment is what is super concerning, you know him best, was it something said in anger, frustration because he is tired, frustrated, feeling neglected or was it an 'aha' moment that this is how he really feels, has he ever said something like this before at all?  I'm not saying what he said isn't horrible, but you know his pattern. \n\nWhen sahm's vent that they are tired to their husbands coming home and they want to hand over the baby, we support them getting a break, right?  But also, weekends and evenings can/should be shared, allowing the sahm to get a break in the evenings is crucial though, but I guess I'm not quite grasping, you say you do it all 100pct, but that he's also the sahp taking on a full day with the baby?", "She starts by saying he does \"what he can, but it's not enough.\" As she goes on, the story gets worse. I'm not convinced she is a reliable narrator.", "Right. So he didn't want to wear a condom. He didn't get a vesectamy, he didn't tell his wife that he doesn't want kids. And now he doesn't want to take care of the baby that his actions (or rather his lack of action) helped cause.\n\nHe's a gigantic asshole. Op is not.", "I hope and pray she did not.  But there are always vital pieces of information missing in these posts.\n\nI always consider anyone the AH if they pull a stunt like that.  Parenting should always be 100% commitment from **both** parents.  It's too big a deal to force anyone into."]}
