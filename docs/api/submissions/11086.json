Recently he asked if we can go on a date-night to a fancy restaurant close by I told him I would think about it cause I was busy taking care of our son, later he came up to me and asked again I told him no and as a response he told me I was \u201cinconsiderate\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t care about his needs\u201d I responded by pointing out I was taking care of our baby and we have to save money for diapers and formula (I can\u2019t breastfeed) and money for essentials since our pay isn\u2019t the best but still enough for the three of us. Ever since I\u2019ve said no though he\u2019s been behaving with an attitude and acting like our baby. If I ask him a question he\u2019ll ignore me until I repeat myself and if I ask him to do something for me such as clean the counter or wash the dishes he\u2019ll wait until like a hour later to do so. I\u2019ve tried to confront him about it but every time I do he blows it off and says it doesn\u2019t matter anymore when it clearly does. It wasn\u2019t until yesterday that I had enough of his behavior and finally told him why I said no. I explained how although he works from home he manages to make little time for changing our son\u2019s diapers, feeding him, and spending quality time with him which only puts more responsibility on me when I return from a long day of work. Not to mention the restaurant he was talking about going to is extremely expensive which would have us pay money we do not have and instead need for bills, the baby, etc. When I yelled at him for this he then talked about how he never wanted this baby to begin with and therefore it\u2019s not his responsibility. We yet have said a word to each other but the neglect towards our son continues and even though he hasn\u2019t asked since the first day he brought my answer is still no until he steps up and gets his act together. I\u2019ve told my friends about the situation as well but so far one has only told me maybe it\u2019s time to quit my job to handle the baby and all the others have said something along the words of \u201cthat\u2019s men for you\u201d or \u201che\u2019s a busy man\u201d. I\u2019m stuck. Our relationship is in a bad place and I\u2019m scared that I may have to end up divorcing him which is the last thing I need right now.

He never wanted the baby in the first place? I don\u2019t mean to pry, but was this unplanned, pregnancy creating strife before the child?

I\u2019ve a strong feeling I know what he is going through - and thought you may think it wrong or unjustified, it wouldn\u2019t make it any less real.\n\nHaving a baby is tough. Nobody ever seems to want to admit that. It is tough on one\u2019s self, it is tough on your spouse and it is tough on your relationship. It\u2019s stressful, sleep patterns are gone, old habits and schedules are gone, **and the ability and time to focus on yourself, on each other, or your relationship is gone**. Babies are the greatest joy, but they are also an incredible workload, and stress point of a relationship sometimes too.\n\nI will openly tell you I felt some of the same after our first was born - there was no me, or more importantly, us time anymore, and I wanted just a touch of it to be there. *It is very likely he misses that, and would like to rekindle a little of the couple piece of you being a couple.* \n\nDon\u2019t shoot the guy down for trying to rekindle a bit of that. It takes a back seat by necessity for the next 20 years of your life. Making \u201cus\u201d time will be tough and sporadic. All the more important to take some needed moments to recognize and cherish the love that brought that baby here in the first place.\n\nNAH\n\nWish you the best with the new bundle of joy!", "YTA....1st it seems your husband didn't want the baby and that should gavr been a dicusision.. 2nd working from home doesn't mean let me watch the baby.
