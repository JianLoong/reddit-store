During Covid Theo (25ish M) joined our crew. In the 2 years we have known him, he has NEVER mentioned a spouse. He\u2019s talked about friends and family, his favorite things, what he\u2019s cooking for dinner, everything but that and kind of made himself sound single. A couple of coworkers even asked him out but he declined because he doesn\u2019t date coworkers. I can\u2019t deny he\u2019s VERY good looking which attracted a lot of interest from coworkers.\n\nA few weeks ago, I was walking home from grocery shopping near work and my bag split. A woman help pick up everything and even offered her tote. We chatted and it turns out she was Theo\u2019s WIFE. They had been married for 3 years so before he even started this job. When I introduced myself as Theo\u2019s coworker, it was clear Theo had told her about work and us but I don\u2019t think she realized that we didn\u2019t know she even existed.\n\nWhen I went to work, I casually asked Theo if he was seeing anyone and he shrugged and said work was too busy. I thought it was weird he wouldn\u2019t mention his wife so I messaged her and said we needed to talk.\n\nWe met later at a cafe and I told her that no one knew who she was because Theo never mentioned her. I talked about how women would flirt with him. I mentioned he never wore a wedding ring. She started blinking hard as if trying not to cry. She looked crushed. But she was a sweetheart and paid for my coffee before I even got a chance to.\n\nThe past few days Theo has been very moody. He started buying lunch instead of bringing one from home. He\u2019s been ignoring me which interferes in our work. He cornered me today after work and told me that his wife was sad and he didn\u2019t know why but it was my fault. He told me to never contact his wife or talk about her again. I told my coworkers what happened and everyone expressed shock that he had a wife. A few coworkers said I was an asshole for telling my coworker\u2019s wife that he hid her existence but most took my side. My boyfriend said I was in the right and people would want to know if their spouse was acting shady like Theo.\n\nEdit: is it not normal to chat with people evenif its strangers?

I've been working with this guy, Michael, since 2009.  I knew he was married because he's complained a couple of times about fixing his mother-in-law's internet, but that's the most he's ever said about family.  He'll tell stories about his college days, things about his yardwork (his war on groundhogs was hilarious) and we'll chat about current events and politics.  I wouldn't say we're close real friends but we're sorta close work friends.\n\nAnyway sometime around 2016, my boss and I were in a training when this woman comes up to us, greeting us like she knows us.

You sound toxic and I can't blame him for ignoring you.", "NTA- he's being shady AF. It'd be wrong not to tell her.", "How did you figure out she was his wife?  And then get her contact info?", "YTA for making this a big deal and seeking her out to dramatically reveal this to her. Why on earth didn\u2019t you just say, when you were chatting over spilled groceries and worked out who she was, \u2018you\u2019re Theo\u2019s wife? That\u2019s wild, I\u2019ve been working with him 2 years and had no idea he was married, he never mentions it\u2019 and let her be curious about that and bring it up with him or not as she was inclined.

I live in a small town too and I wouldn't agree to meet up with the colleague of whoever I was in a relationship with if I didn't even know that colleague well.", "ESH.\n\nYour looking up his wife on LinkedIn and messaging her there makes me more suspicious of **you** at this point. (OK. Maybe not **more**, but sure right up there with him.)\n\nTelling the wife the way you did was kind of crummy. You made it sound like he was doing something wrong. While it\u2019s not what *most* people would do, it\u2019s what he\u2019s doing. It\u2019s not fair to assume he has nefarious intentions here.\n\nYour saving grace is that wife doesn\u2019t blame you for providing the information.\n\nIt\u2019s Theo\u2019s choice what he discloses about his private life to his coworkers. He doesn\u2019t want to discuss his spouse. That\u2019s his prerogative. Doesn\u2019t mean I agree with his choice. But it is his choice.\n\nAnd this all said, because you did meet her outside of the context of work, I guess you can make the call if you should tell other coworkers or not.\n\nEDITS: Changed judgment from OP is the a-hole to everyone is the a-hole. At this point, if I were the wife, I\u2019d be really upset. My man doesn\u2019t talk about me very much to coworkers (nor I him, but I likely mention him more than he mentions me), but he doesn\u2019t deny my existence. And if I found out if he were, I\u2019d be really hurt, too.\n\nI would be disinclined to believe *anything* that came out of Theo\u2019s mouth regarding his family at this point. Maybe he doesn\u2019t mention his wife because the chances of people running into his wife in a town of 7,000 people is too high, so he just doesn\u2019t say anything about her at all. Note, too, he never flat-out lied about being married. He chose his words very carefully. Crummy, maybe even skeevy, but not overtly nefarious at this point.\n\nBecause mom and \u201cfriend\u201d are unlikely to ever meet any coworkers, he\u2019s probably just made up details to satisfy people\u2019s curiosity regarding his private life.\n\nThis whole situation would make me keep Theo at arm\u2019s length.", "Let's assume this story is real.\n\nOn the one hand, Theo *seems* a lil shady to you... but also, the man has a right to a personal life outside work. A *private* life, even. He doesn't owe his colleagues an explanation of what he does outside of work hours, or who he does it with. If he needs time off to get married, he doesn't have to say what his vacation days are for. Ditto paternity leave, bereavement, or dentist appointments. It's not ya' business.\n\nOk, ok... if there's a company health plan, HR needs to know if he's got a spouse. But I get the feeling you're not HR.\n\nIs he dating coworkers? Boning clients? Making passes at upper management? No? All he's doing is not mentioning his wife? THE NERVE OF THIS GUY!\n\nThe right way to handle this would have been to casually mention to THEO that you bumped into his wife, small world eh?

Im not saying he has to gush about her all the time but its shocking that he lied and said he wasn't seeing anyone. I get that not everyone likes sharing their private life but, OP mentions that they know a good deal about his personal life. They know that his mother has depression but they don't know he's married? \n\nMaybe I'm being paranoid but I feel this is a set up so if anyone catches him with another woman, they won't know he's having an affair. That's just a hunch though. OP might be a bit nosy but hey I'm nosy too and I would definitely want to know if I was in the wife's position. Plus the fact that his wife is still upset with him means that she doesn't even believe his bs excuses. I would also like to point out that Theo has no authority to tell OP not to hang out with his wife, its not his call.  \n\nThere's definitely more to the story here.

It was the morally correct thing to do.", "My boyfriend said the same thing. I felt bad for her because she was clearly a nice person.", "But it doesn't sound like Theo lied to his wife at all.

It kind of depends on how inappropiate he was being with flirting.", "I think you are onto something.

All you have to do is introduce yourself and then they'll probably tell you who they know that knows you. Or they mention their last name.
