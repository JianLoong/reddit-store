Boyfriend told his roommate, and he wanted to go. He asked, I said no. Now I\u2019m an asshole. \n\nBackstory- \nMy boyfriend and I are 27 and have been dating for 3 years. I\u2019m in grad school and graduate in May. To celebrate, I\u2019ve planned a weekend trip to Chicago for us. It\u2019ll be a fun weekend since we have been doing long distance for 2/3 of our relationship. \n\nMy boyfriend has a roommate, \u201cTyler\u201d who for the most part is whatever, but he\u2019s \u201cstuck\u201d. He works as an assistant manager at a grocery store in a very small town and has no bigger ambitions. He\u2019s very \u201ccontent\u201d with where he\u2019s at, and has no desire to change anything in his life. (Content is in quotes because he\u2019s not happy and wants to change things about himself, but is not motivated to do so.) \n\nActual story- \n\nMy boyfriend and I were discussing some things we wanted to do, and his roommate overheard and asked what we were talking about so we told him. A few days after I left, Tyler asked my boyfriend if he could come with and my boyfriend said it was my trip and since I was doing most of the planning, he\u2019d have to ask me but I\u2019d probably say no. He also mentioned if he did come we\u2019d need to find someone to watch the dogs. He messaged me and asked, and I said no because \u201cthis was a weekend for us to spend some *quality* time together.\u201d (Direct quote and hinting that we wanted alone time.) He told me I was being a bitchy, bitter asshole and that he wasn\u2019t going to watch our dogs while we were gone. I said fine, but don\u2019t expect us to watch yours when you go to Canada next month. \n\nHe then backpedaled and eventually I said he could come with the following conditions: \n- He\u2019d have to chip in for gas \n- Help pay for a pet sitter \n- He\u2019d have to get his own room which he could split with someone AND I offered to pay for the room up front but him paying me back for the cost of the room was non-negotiable \n- He could not tag along on the romantic night my boyfriend was planning. \n\nHe then proceeded to tell me I\u2019m way too much of a high maintenance asshole and that he liked my boyfriends ex way better since she\u2019d never have a problem with him coming and would never make him do any of that. \n\nTyler did try to get my boyfriend involved, and I showed him our messages which he\u2019s not happy about but I told him this was our problem that we can sort out. Tyler has not said anything about the trip to my boyfriend yet. \n\nSo, am I being unreasonable with my requests? Am I really being an asshole?

It\u2019s understandable to wanna go on a trip with your best mate (if that\u2019s what they are) but this weekend is not the time for it. They can have their own weekend some other time.\n\nAlso your requests are reasonable as heck but he proceeds to berate you after you said he could come along.", "NTA \n\n\nYou should never have relented in the 1st place. Tyler's out of order", "NTA.  1., He invited himself.  2., You're not Tyler's girlfriend so Tyler doesn't get to complain.  Might cost you a kennel though.", "No. You're not. Everyone needs some time on their own. He's your boyfriend's flat mate, not your son, so it seems insane to me that he seems to believe that he's entitled to come. If I suggested going to Italy for the weekend with my girlfriend and one of her pals went 'Can I come' I'd have said absolutely not. I also would not tolerate someone spewing vulgarities like that at anyone I cared about.", "NTA, this is a wild concept for me. The roommate, whom is there to reduce living costs for both parties by cohabitating, wants to join you and your boyfriend on your vacation.\n\nWhat in the fuck? How does it even get into your mind to ask to go? He has what we like to call the \"Audacity\".\n\nBut let's say you entertain the offer.\n\nY'all could ride up there but he gets his own accommodations. You set a fixed departure and rally time for return.\n\nIf he's not there when it's time to leave, you just leave and teach a valuable lesson.", "NTA at all, Tyler seems like a self entitled lazy leech.  I\u2019d question your BF\u2019s decision making and lack of a backbone.", "NTA\n\nBut your mistake here was saying he could come with conditions. You should have stuck to your guns and said no. You want a romantic trip together, that\u2019s the end of it. You\u2019re not an AH op but I do think you\u2019ve made the situation worse.", "So are you an ahole for not letting someone crash your celebration get away with your BF in which you can have some quality time together?

Your opinions on Tyler\u2019s job, ambitions and overall satisfaction with life aren\u2019t really relevant to the story, unless I\u2019m missing something here. Did you just add them to emphasise your dislike/disapproval of this person you randomly allowed to join your romanic weekend? And why do you feel you should possibly do something closer to home to accommodate your long distance boyfriend\u2019s roommate\u2019s vague desire to hang out? Why did you not involve your boyfriend in these conversations in the first place, seeing as he\u2019s the one actually living with the guy?\n\nI feel like there\u2019s something you\u2019re omitting, and honestly your post almost reads as though you\u2019re a little hung up on Tyler.", "NTA - Can't imagine wanting to be a 3rd wheel on a romantic vacation with my friend and their SO. That's just weird.", "Your the AH for judging his occupation.  That's his life let him have it.  He doesn't want to climb the corporate world.  NTA for wanting a couples only trip.  Tyler is a third wheel and has no shame.  Your bf needs to draw a hard line in the same with him and say sometimes he's going out with you with out him and he needs to grow up.", "NTA - but you should NEVER have offered him to tag along, even if your conditions are reasonable enough. This is a trip for you and your boyfriend to celebrate graduation and have a good time, your roommate is a complete weirdo for not getting that he'll be the third wheel.", "NTA, he's a dumbass.

Your boyfriend's roommate is insisting on going along a romantic mini-vacation with you both.  And he claims **you** are the AH for insisting on boundaries such as \"our romantic night is ours alone\" and \"you pay your way\"?    Tyler really needs a reality check.  He is not the center of the world.  \n\nI have two close long-time friends.  They are a couple.  When they go for romantic getaways, even just a day trip, I don't even **think** to ask to tag along.  Even if I were to pay my way.  Why?  It's not about me.  Tyler fails to grasp this basic concept.\n\nWhy is your boyfriend not defending you here?", "NTA. It\u2019s a date for a couple. \n\nSuggest a compromise. Tyler can come to the same city but with limitations. He needs his own transportation to and from city, and within city. He needs his own hotel room, absolutely no sharing. He needs to plan his own agenda for himself and you will not be participating in anything with him. He needs to plan all meals for himself and y\u2019all will not be joining him for anything. In other words, he can go on solo vacation.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

If he likes the ex so much maybe he should be in a relationship with her.\n\nI don't think you agreeing to him tagging along has helped, you should have stuck to No being the answer but what's done is done.\n\nYou were very reasonable and he is the complete AH oh and as for your bf he needs to have your back, he really should be telling his roomie to stop being an AH.", "NTA\n\nBut why did you give in at all? That's on you.", "NTA - you didn't even want him to come, and eventually you budged with COMPLETELY reasonable terms. you were already trying to accommodate him more than you had - and wanted - to. he shouldn't have invited himself in the first place, and if the new offer wasnt okay with him, he should have thanked you and politely declined. instead, he went on to be rude about it and insult you. I wish you a happy vacation with your boyfriend regardless.", "NTA--My God your boyfriend should have said no to Tyler right away. That aside when you compromised (which, with all due respect, I think you shouldn't have done) he complains about terms that really, amongst mature adult, should be understood. Tyler is a baby, your boyfriend should have played more of a role in this. Unless you were rude and condescending, you did nothing wrong", "NTA. Your boyfriend is also kind of an AH for setting up a situation where you're the bad guy.", "You're NTA but you shouldn't have caved in the first place. This is your trip, and the last thing you need is a third wheel who has tantrums and insults you when he doesn't get his way.", "NTA. Quite frankly I'm utterly surprised that 1) you even need to ask if you are, and 2) you ever entertained the idea of letting him go in the first place. What idiot insists on going on a couple's trip, by himself, with a couple? Is he your boyfriend's secret lover or something?", "NTA- I suggest you tell him no he can\u2019t go and find a pet sitter so he can\u2019t hold that over your head.  Put it this way, if you give in now what about if this relationship leads to marriage: will he go on your honeymoon and be in the delivery room too?  Set boundaries. Edit: I do find it very strange that your boyfriend is not setting these boundaries.  You are doing too much of the work in this relationship.", "NTA a bit concerned about your boyfriend's stance on this. I'd be asking myself why he hasn't shut his roommate down, surely he would want to get some alone time with you. The roommate would make any intimacy awkward.\nUnless I'm just sex-obsessed, I'd be questioning whether he wants to be your boyfriend, or if he may be avoiding intimacy for other reasons.", "Basically he can come on the trip he wasn't invited to and demanded to come on but has to pay for himself and entertain himself?  And he's not okay with these terms   How are YOU the one being called high maintenance?\n\nNTA    He wants to turn a couples getaway into a friend trip on your dime.", "I am in a poly relationship with a married couple.

We have romantic nights the three of us as well.\n\nI did have to remind her their wedding anniversary date and him how many years last week when they were booking. Then I kept myself out of their plans because I can read a room. And this one was a double\u2026\n\nTyler is one of those my bestie is my surrogate partner types and being an AH about it.

I don\u2019t understand why your boyfriend isn\u2019t telling Tyler no. Or why Tyler thinks it\u2019s ok to call you a bitch and still expect you to hang out with him. \n\nHe\u2019s obviously jealous that he doesn\u2019t get the same relationship with his buddy when buddy has a girlfriend, and I understand that, but that doesn\u2019t make it ok to call her a bitch.", "NTA if your boyfriend feels the need to bring someone along on your trip as a couple I think the both of you need to re evaluate your relationship.\n\nI mean there could be thousands of reasons, but instead of him discussing it with you first he discussed it with you last and removed himself from the issues he caused to let you and Tyler at it together.", "NTA since 3rd wheels need to be invited not just insert themselves into other's plans", "NTA. This also probably why the ex left. Your boyfriend may want to start setting some boundaries before it caused any problems between you. It also sounded like he wanted a free trip to tag along.", "Nta. \n\nI have so many questions \n\nBut first Op Your boyfriend needs to speak up. Even just say it\u2019s weird he wants you to pay for him to go on a romantic couples trip. Like does he have crush on you? Or your boyfriend and getting jealous? Or is it really he want a free holiday? \n\nDoes you or your boyfriend pay for him? Like every takeaway n extra bills or his gas his weed. Just stuff I dunno he is acting like you two would pay because you do normally?", "NTA. Odd behavior from the boyfriend, though. Why would he WANT his roommate there cutting into private time with OP? I'd perk up a bit more regarding that whole situation but no. Op, you're fine it's the roommate who is the AH.", "NTA. I cannot believe that you even entertained inviting him. And where TF is your boyfriends backbone? I cannot believe he allows his roommate to speak to you like that.", "NTA, though you shouldn't have even given him those conditions. I get where you're coming from but things like that always make it worse, they both feel like a negotiating position - I don't mind you coming but I want something in return! - and the conditions themselves feel insulting. Don't hint, just say 'this is a trip for us as a couple.' The phrase 'third wheel' exists for a reason.\n\nThose are minor nitpicks though, you're clearly right, Tyler isn't an asshole for asking but he is about everything else, and your boyfriend should have said no right away. Him phrasing it as it's 'your' trip and you're the bad guy isn't great, I get that he wants peace with his roommate but that's a pretty ridiculous level of 'I'll have to ask my manager.' You're a couple, couples go on trips!", "NTA.  You\u2019re nicer than me, I\u2019d never have even made the offer to join the travel plans. Roommate sounds like a child. And odd to not realize he\u2019ll be the squeaky third wheel. Side note\u2014If he does go and he actually chips in,  maybe use some of that money to buy your boyfriend a spine.", "Nta people who invite themselves into other people\u2019s trips or events are either clueless or have an agenda. Tyler sounds like he\u2019s doing a bit of both. Other posters scolded you for judging his job and lack of ambition in life. On the surface it does seem snobby but I think it lines up with his really inappropriate response to wanting to tag along on a couple\u2019s weekend and then throwing a tantrum when he\u2019s told he isn\u2019t welcome. This man is immature. This is the reaction of a child when mom and dad want to go out without him. He\u2019s a grown man. He should be getting his own girlfriend and planning his own getaways not inserting himself into yours. \n\nI would not have let him come. His reaction to having to pay his own way, calling you high maintenance and bringing up the ex girlfriend is indicative of what the trip will be like. There will be some BS the entire time I guarantee you whether he\u2019s going to bitch about what you\u2019re doing or who\u2019s paying or you\u2019re both ignoring him. Tell him he isn\u2019t coming and put your dogs in a kennel because he sounds like he\u2019ll neglect them out of spite.", "NTA, you shouldn\u2019t have even tried to compromise. It\u2019s a romantic getaway to celebrate your graduation.", "nta bf needs to stick up for you tho", "Tyler is a freeloading mooch. Your conditions are more than reasonable. You should probably just rescind the offer and go without him because he is behaving like a child who will expect you to feed and entertain him on YOUR trip.

If my roomate spoke to my gf like that there would be even bigger issues.... so it sorta sounds like tyler the loser is an AH but also your bf is pooching this hard and needs to step up and tell tyler where to go. yikes, you are NTA. tread carefully!", "\u201cTyler you can\u2019t be a part of our relationship.\u201d", ">He\u2019d have to chip in for gas\n\n\rThis is very reasonable\n\n>\rHelp pay for a pet sitter\n\n\rthis one isn't, Tyler isn't free pet sitting, your pets, your responsibility.\n\n>\rHe\u2019d have to get his own room which he could split with someone AND I offered to pay for the room up front but him paying me back for the cost of the room was non-negotiable  \n>  \n>\r  \nHe could not tag along on the romantic night my boyfriend was planning.\n\nthe last 2 are very reasonable conditions\n\nNTA, it's a romantic mini vacation for you and your bf, why would you bring a third wheel?", "NTA. I am sorry that you felt the need to make the (conditional) second offer. Your no means no. Tyler should just go on a trip with his own friends or partner.", "NTA why would he think he could tag along on your vacation and why would he want to be a third wheel?", "NTA-and yes it\u2019s totally customary to split costs on trips", "op=NTA   It is rude to invite yourself to a romantic/couple's weekend, but his refusal to take NO is VERY RUDE.   One might escape rude if they only hint and get \"offered\" \n\nBut you seem extremely na\u00efve.  Even if he agrees to all your agreements, he won't follow through on paying.  You said you'd book/pay for his room on condition he pay you back--how will you enforce that.\n\nWithdraw your conditional offer and say, sorry this is just for BF and me.  Feel free to make your own plans.  \n\nYes, it is standard to expect to pay your own way unless you are INVITED and the INVITER says they will be paying your share.  \n\nAnd don't trust your/bf's pets under his sole supervision--I would not trust him to give good care with this current attitude.", "BF should have shut that request down immediately and not tried to push it off on OP. NTA", "It's a case of damned if you do and damned if you don't. \n\nIf boyfriend steps in he's a misogynist cos OP obviously isn't able to adult for herself and tell roommate what's what.\n\nIf he doesn't step in he's a problem because he's not defending OP.\n\nRoommate is the AH because he's throwing a tantie for being told no.\n\nStop backpedaling and trying to make this work OP. If roommate comes along, he will hijack the trip.", "Good point.  Sounds like there's some weird dynamic here that makes no sense.\n\nI can't see someone insulting me and me going \"Sure, you can come along on our vacation after insulting me.\"", "Yes! This!", "I think there\u2019s probably some level of codependency going on there with OPs boyfriend and his roommate. But like you said that doesn\u2019t mean anything romantic or sexual is at play at all. People can have codependent relationships outside of a romantic/sexual partnership. I think people overlook that because when people talk about codependency it\u2019s almost always in the context of romantic partnerships or parent-child relationships. Platonic codependency kind of flies under the radar.", "NTA, those conditions that you gave him seem like the bare minimum?? Of course he has to pay his fair share if he\u2019s coming lol", "NTA.  How could your boyfriend let him talk to you like that!  The first \"b\\*tch\" that would have came out of his mouth, I would have told him to screw himself and you're not coming.   You were not invited to begin with.  DO NOT LET ANYONE, INCLUDING YOUR BOYFRIEND, TALK TO YOU LIKE THIS!", "NTA", "Hollywood makes movies about this. You're NTA. Leave the roommate behind and let him have a movie weekend of his own WHY he can't go.", "\"Dude, we're planning this as a romantic getaway and a celebration of my achievement. Why would you think that this is a random vacation that you can join in on? It's just weird to think that you can hop in on something that is supposed to celebrate my achievements, and then tell me that you like his ex better, and expect me to want you to join us??? All I'm hearing right now is you want me to fund your vacation while also disparaging me for wanting to have a vacation with my partner.\"\n\nAlso, let your partner deal with his friend. Otherwise you will definitely be called \"controlling\". And objectively, they would not be wrong. I get that you are trying to deal with this as a \"you and Tyler\" issue. But your primary relationship is your partner, and Tyler's primary relationship is your partner. \n\nLet your partner figure it out. Unless you are afraid that this is truly a partner issue and not a \"Tyler\" issue?", "NTA for saying 'no,' but, frankly, you are confusing me (and probably Tyler and your bf, too).\n\n1. Why did you ever say 'yes' (even with conditions)?\n2. I get why your bf doesn't want to be in-between you and Tyler. I interpreted your post to say that Tyler contacted you directly after he initially approached your bf. If so, I understand why you replied with your initial 'no'. Given his response, why did you continue to engage with him at all, much less offer him a path to joining you and your bf?\n3. End this now. 'No' and no further discussion. Get a pet sitter for your trip. Do not trust Tyler; he sounds immature, vindictive, and not a safe guardian of bf's pet.", "NTA and Tyler sounds like a freeloader", "Nta- the only moment of AH was letting him come at all.  He is AH from another realm.  Tell him no. And GO BY YOURSELVES", "NTA\n\nTyler honestly expected to come on the trip and not pay for his own room and travelling expenses? That is totally out of order. What did he expect to do? Shair your room with you. What a dick.", "Tyler needs to check his mouth before he catches something with it IMO\nYou boy has no spine or else he\u2019s the one pushing Tyler to come behind your back", "NTA\n\nBut you have a boyfriend problem - the answer should have been no from the start, not this \u201cask my girlfriend\u201d nonsense.\n\nHe passed the buck so his roommate would be mad at you, not him.\n\nIt is unbelievably entitled to act like you can just join a couples trip, and that any time he was met with anything he didn\u2019t like - even reasonable expectations like paying for his own room, chipping in for gas, and there would be plans he couldn\u2019t be a part of - he immediately resorted to insulting you.\n\nNone of your expectations here are high maintenance. \n\nFrankly you should have never given any possible conditions that allowed him to join; his insults to you are reason enough to pull the offer - why would you want someone who is terrible to you on your vacation? Pay for your own pet sitting and don\u2019t worry about it.\n\nAnd your boyfriend needs to pick who he is actually dating.", "NTA. While on your trip you and your boyfriend should discuss getting a place together. AND STILL NOT WATCH THAT AHs DOG WHEN HE GOES TO CANADA", "NTA. Tyler is selfish and self absorbed as hell.", "NTA at all.\nIts worrying you have to question that you might have been the AH for refusing the sheer audacity of this guy thinking he's entitled to come on yours and your bfs romantic holiday.", "Is Tyler dumb?", "NTA. Go to Pequod\u2019s for deep dish pizza.", "The response to everything to do with a partner isn't to break up with them immediately. That's just dumb.", "Absolutely right re: problematic boyfriend.I married a man who I knew was doing whatever he could to avoid confrontation with his ex-wife. 10 years later, guess what - whenever we had a conflict, he would say anything to get out of the conflict. It was certainly my assumption that he'd have more respect for me than others, and it took me that long to figure it out that the way he treats others is the way he was also treating me. \n\nIf you stay with him, 500-million-percent uninvite the roommate NOW. It's your graduation trip. NTA", "It's absolutely *not* a case of damned either way.\n\nIt's a romantic trip that OP is planning for the both of them. Tyler wanting to tag along is an insane social request and the BF would be absolutely validated if he had laughed in Tyler's face and said buddy, this isn't a random trip to Chicago; we're celebrating OP graduating in amongst a whole lotta loving.\n\nThere is no reason to gender his responses but by even entertaining telling Tyler to talk to OP, the BF now looks conflict avoidant instead of being direct.", "I think you might have something here.\n\nIf Boyfriend thinks like OP, that anyone coming would share the costs, then maybe he thought he was doing a \"good thing\" for her budget(he'd be wrong LOL).   \nie--share cost of gas(that would only go up a smidge to compensate for more weight in vehicle) but divided by half/third.  \n\nDepending on rooms.  Maybe a 2 bedroom suite instead of two room?(divided in half/third)  Don't know if that could be Cheaper(my hotel stays have not been recent)."]}
