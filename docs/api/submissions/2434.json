Because the thing is, once she's there, if she decides to cause problems Pandora's Box is open. Then you either have to bite your tongue and suffer through it, or see your wedding devolve into a circus when she has to be removed.\n\nIt doesn't sound like you have much of anything resembling a positive relationship with her, and her poor treatment of you continued even after you moved out and were just visiting, so I truly cannot see why you would be obligated to invite her. Your logic based on your history with her is clear and (I think) reasonable, so I just don't see why not inviting her could be a bad thing. You aren't obligated to include someone who only makes you miserable.\n\nNTA", "NTA, you deserve to have people surround and uplift you with love and positivity on one of the most special days of your life. It\u2019s sounds like your stepmother has never and will never be one of those people. \n\nYour father is making it clear that he has no issue with the way she has treated you, which beg the question is he really someone you want to continue to have in your life? Is he bringing anything positive to your life? \n\nIf he is making it clear that him and his horrible wife are a package deal (which somewhat understandable) then so be it. Let the trash take itself out and have a great day. \n\nSide note: have you gone into full detail with your fianc\u00e9 about how that woman has made you feel and the mental anguish she has caused? If not you need to so he can understand why you feel this way. If so, I strongly urge you to consider spending the rest of your life with someone who could so easily dismiss years worth of hurt and emotional abuse. That\u2019s usually a bad sign.", "NTA you shouldn't compromise on your own happiness.", "NTA. Your fianc\u00e9 didn't grow up with her or know the relationship you have with her so they don't get a vote on this.

You should be happy and have as few details to worry about on your wedding day as possible.  Step would run that.  You\u2019ve set the boundaries.

Daddy has a choice - come alone or don\u2019t come at all.\nIf fianc\u00e9 is so gung ho on her coming, let him know marriage is off if she comes.\nAnd ask him how he would feel if you invited all you exes and every kid who bullied him.", "NTA\n\nLet me be frank. So she basically subjected you to a form of constant mental abuse that made you self conscious and miserable your entire childhood, but you\u2019re supposed to suck it up for her? That day is about you. It\u2019s supposed to be special, filled with love and support. Why invite someone who was basically your abuser and never get to relax and enjoy the moment because you\u2019re always expecting the next barb? \n\nIt\u2019s easy for your fianc\u00e9 to say to get over it. He didn\u2019t have to live it for over a decade. He isn\u2019t the one who still gets belittled. I\u2019d say give him a taste of what it was like, but I\u2019m guessing you may not be petty enough for that. \n\nAnd about your dad, he was and is an enabler who doesn\u2019t want to rock the boat. If he chooses his wife (the abuser), which is his prerogative, over his daughters wedding day, then good riddance. It\u2019ll suck to not have him there, but it\u2019ll suck more to have a day ruined by your stepmom that you don\u2019t get to do over later. \n\nBest of luck OP", "NTA.
