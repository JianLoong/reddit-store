Your fianc\u00e9 may not understand because he was not from a dysfunctional family, and people who don't experience problems have trouble understanding how bad they can be.  Tell your father that no matter how she behaves at the wedding, her presence would be a reminder of the abuse she put you through, and she is not invited.  He is, of course, welcome to come without her if he values his own child's happiness.  NTA", "NTA.

And Tell your fiance he is right, its only one day and you wanna have It without drama. \nIts your wedding, and you know she always is the same way. She was years to change and nothing does. This is your day, your choice, and you have to be surounder for people and family Who suported you. She its not one of these people.\nI recomended if you don't invite her and dont want drama, hire security, in case she came anyway or your father came whit her. Dont seem he suported you aswell.", "Never mind the dad and stepmother what is wrong with your fiance?! If I was marrying someone and they said \"Hey, I know so-and-so is part of my family but they've abused me since I was a kid and invalidated my conditions\" there is NO WAY I would want them at the wedding.

I do not want someone who looks for every opportunity to criticize and harangue me at my wedding, full stop. I do not like her, love her, or trust her. I do not like walking on eggshells around her. If not inviting her means that you skip it, too, I will miss you a lot, but I will understand.

Just one comment. Because they see the one small comment and to you the baggage and the pattern is huge and upsetting.\n\nWhat exactly will you regret according to your dad? Is that a threat? That being said, ya, he has every right to not attend if you disinvite her. Some would say he had an obligation to not attend, in fact. \n\nSo. NTA. But I recommend counseling, inviting her, and keeping her at arms length both that day and moving forward. One hello and one goodbye and no fucking advice!!! If she squawks you can invite her to a counseling session and really tell her how you feel and why.", "NTA.", "Absolutely NTA.\n\nYou were abused.  Your Dad didn't protect you from his wife.

Your wife doesn't understand, probably because she grew up with a functional family.\n\nIt really comes down to whether or not you still love your Dad in spite of everything.  She's his wife.  He chose her over you a long time ago.  He probably isn't going to your wedding without her, as would be the case with the vast majority of established couples, whether engaged, married or long term partners.  \n\nNo one here can tell you how you feel about Dad.

It's a shame that your dad and fiance don't validate your feelings.  There are few things in life more frustrating than having someone minimize something that's very deeply felt or very important to you.\n\nHave you explained in-depth to your fiance why you feel the way you do about your MIL?

You also have a dad and fiance problem", "NTA.  It comes down to whether you want the bully who traumatized you for life to be at your wedding.  My vote would be no.  I would also not regret it.
