Out of emotions i asked my husband if i can give her a second name, i wanted to call her like my grandma. He was fine with it so i put the name on the birth certificate. \n\nJust two months after that his familie and him made problems bcs of the names. They wanted me to change it to his mum wishes.\nI was totally against it\nIt felt like changing the identity of the baby girl. \n\nAnd they havent stopped with it. \n\nMy daugthet is now 1 year and 1 month old. \nNow they telling my father to make me change the name and so on.\n\nI am really angry about this situation.

Doesn\u2019t sound like he\u2019ll be any sort of worthwhile father.", "NTA and do not go to his country ever. Seek asylum and citizenship in the country your daughter was born in and never return to your husbands village. This is all about control on his families part, not sure why you married this man, maybe young infatuation but you are not benefiting from this marriage and likely never were if you were living abroad sending him money. Stop being his cash cow and look into hire to divorce him without traveling to his country.", "NTA and this marriage is weird and not healthy for you. Not sure how you even ended up marrying this guy without knowing the info you mentioned and the problems that arouse, but what's done is done. You should give it a lot of thinking now tho, for the sake of your child, if nothing else.", "NTA. Please find a good attorney that specializes in family law and start proceedings to end this sham of a marriage.", "NTA, seems like you\u2019re doing this all by yourself. I don\u2019t know why you\u2019re still married to that man, seems to live under his mother\u2019s apron.

It's your decision and name changes can be super expensive. Also, your husband just isn't putting in the work for you and Lila, and I'd reconsider whether you want to be with him.", "So you never see him. He doesn't provide for you financially. He doesn't provide for you emotionally and infact is causing you emotional grief. Let's his family bully him into going back on decisions you made as a couple and is helping them to try bully you into changing things too. This isn't  a marriage. Do not move there if they are this controlling when you're in different countries it'll be million times worse when you move there. Honestly would divorce him and make sure he doesn't ever get her alone else he'll take her back there and keep her there. NTA", "NTA. You made an agreement with your husband. His family convinced him to change his mind, and now he\u2019s gaslighting (a form of controlling abuse where the manipulator tries to get the victim to distrust their perceptions) you about it. You stood by the original agreement, withstanding the abuse. \n\nYour husband is not a good partner for you. He won\u2019t protect you from his family. He lies and manipulates you. \n\nYou get nothing out of this relationship but pain. Why would you choose to remain married to someone who clearly doesn\u2019t value you or himself (since he won\u2019t stand up for anything he believes in - just the stuff his mother believes in)?  Divorce this clown - you\u2019ll be so much happier without him.", "NTA - but too naive about the marriage etc. You really do need help.\n\nINFO NEEDED:  \n\nHow old is your husband?\n\nWhat is the religion of your husband?\n\nWhere did you get married - **under which law**?\n\nWhen did you get married?\n\nWhat country are you in now? (diff. help possible in diff. countries)\n\nWhat is your/ the childs nationality?\n\nI honestly dont think your inlaws do Reddit, and to be able to give useful advise, and not waste anybodys time, the info is important.\n\nI guess from the little info so far, that your husband is muslim, living with his family, and you must under NO circumstances let yourself be lured into goin to his country, \"to show your daughter to his family\" - you **will** definitly loose her if you do so.", "Get a divorce, full custody, and tbh if at all possible no visitation, no contact.

You will not be able to get her out again.", "NTA, but I have to ask why would mary a person like this? Contributes nothing and not just in a financial sense.\n\nIf he comes to visit watch him around your id or it might end up back in his country.", "NTA. Sounds like the typical controlling in-laws from a very traditional country. If your husband isn't supporting you in any way, then what's the point of your marriage? He won't even stand up to his parents for you and he won't take any steps to improve his skills to help financially support you and your daughter. Right now, he's reaping all the benefits of the marriage, with you paying for his lifestyle and study until recently.\n\nThis is not a good marriage that is worth staying in. It's ultimately your decision, but it sounds like you're better off without a husband causing you unnecessary stress and raising your daughter alone.", "NTA.

You're in Germany with your daughter, it doesn't sound like your husband is an EU citizen or that you particularly like him, so you have all the power in this situation.

Her parents agree they should not have arranged the marriage and are apologetic about it. Husband does medieval patriarchy stuff all day whilst she runs herself ragged.\n\nBail, bail now!", "That\u2019s good news! If your marriage is only legal in Pakistan, it should at least make the legal situation in Germany easier. Too bad you put his name on the birth certificate and I\u2019d definitely see a lawyer about it, but I\u2018m pretty sure with him not even having been in the country *and* never paying anything, getting rid of any rights he may claim should be easy. \n\nI\u2019m a bit worried regarding your own family though. Is that just your father\u2019s side? What does your mother say? If they pressured you into marriage in the first place, is there a chance of them collaborating with him to take your child from you? Or have they woken up by now?", "Ah; see my other comment.  Virtually same situation (bar UK and both parents being from Pakistan).  Culture clash, will never work.  Leave now.", "OP were you married only in an Islamic ceremony but not in a civil marriage? If so then your marriage would not be recognized (legal) in Germany or many (if any) of the other western countries which means you could live your life as you wish because you aren't legally married", "OP is German. It doesn't matter if his name is on the birth certificate. You need to register him as a father at the Jugendamt or be legally married. Then he would have paternal rights. And at least until the age of 3 German courts won't even force overnight visits, let alone custody. He'll have visitation rights, which he has the obligation to pay for, organise and go to OP.\n\nOP. You're not legally married here! Just order Steuerklasse 2 and block him! You can do better and easier!"]}
