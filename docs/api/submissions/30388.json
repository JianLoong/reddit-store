My husband (40) was there through the entire process. We currently have 3 children (7, 5, and 2). As a couple this is our 3rd misscariage ( 2 we're from prior relationships). I was heading into my 2nd trimester when I started having symptoms of a MMC. We had found out through testing it was a boy. It was very traumatic as I went into labor and hemmoraged and was taken by ambulance to the hospital I also ended up having surgery because my misscarriage was incomplete. I'm a spiritual person a a few nights later I had a dream where a little boy came to me wearing all white saying \"HI mommy I'm (let's say mark) and I'm going to send you an angel one day\" I woke up and knew thar was my son's name. I discussed it with my husband and he understood but was distant. My husband is very avoidant. I gave him space and time. Every year I get each of my kids an ornament for Christmas that represents something important they did or liked. I decided to order \"Mark\" an ornament. I never said I wanted it displayed in fact it will most likely go in a box I'm making him. I shared this with my husband and he said \"that name doesn't mean anything to me. It only does to you.\" I understood it was coming from him grieving and while I was upset by what he said I still gave him space. He has further insisted that he doesn't like that I went behind his back. I told him I had no intention of hanging it up. He went on to say I wasted money. I asked if he wanted to talk about his feelings but he has shut down again. I understand that he is grieving and needs time but I feel like lately everything that I do is wrong around him ie. Kids not listening the house being a mess or me even sleeping an extra 30 minutes on the weekends. My husband was not present for our prior losses as a couple because he traveled so much so I'm not sure about how he processed these losses. I have given him a list of resources he can use and offer to help in any way possible. I just can't help but feeling like I am TA in all this.\n\nEdit: we also had to decide on funeral arrangements for our son. Because we have a special needs child at home we both decided that the hospital handle the cremation and/or burial.

It's an incredibly painful time for you both and you will both process it in your own ways. There was a time after my first loss when my in-laws put a bench surrounded by chicken wire near a cabin we have and told me they'd built a memory garden for me. I was horrified. That was the absolute last thing in the world I wanted. Not to mention that it was a garden in name only and was a sad, lonely bench surrounded by dry dirt and wire. I hate it. It causes me pain to see it. That \"garden\" is as barren as my womb. But I just said thank you and never spoke of it again. Because of my losses they will never be grandparents and it hurts for them too. To each their own. I wanted to put it behind me and move on. They wanted to honor the memory. No one is wrong. Grief is inherently personal.", "NAH. But your beliefs are in conflict. He probably feels strange that you have a personal and spiritual connection to your \u201cson\u201d who was, to him, never a real child, but a pregnancy that miscarried. A fetus that became non-viable. Not a person, and certainly not a person with a name and who spoke to him, as you believe he did in your dream. He may feel confused and weirdly left out. How can you have a son named Mark that you seem to know and love and grieve, while he just has an unnamed fetus and the potential for a son to grieve? You\u2019re handling your loss in very different ways.", "NAH.\nYour husband is right that you should name the child together. And the order an ornament with the agreed upon name. But your not an AH for needing an ornament to commemorate your lost child. I have one for each of ine as well.", "I have had two miscarriages. After the first one I was shopping at Walmart and in the Christmas ornament section they sold these plastic hearts, made to look like gemstones. Each had a month printed on them, each color coordinated to the month. I picked out a diamond April for me and one for my daughter and husband. Then went back and got an amethyst one for my son, Marrock, we lost at 14 weeks gestation. I lost him in June 2018 My husband cried when he saw it, I didn\u2019t even have to explain. My second miscarriage came in May 2020. I never knew gender for this one, but that Christmas, hung a new green May heart. All 5 sit near each other on the tree and my now 7yo daughter understands what they are for. \n\nNTA.", "NAH. But please, PLEASE get counseling - the both of you - before you consider another pregnancy. If you\u2019ve already had five miscarriages, odds are you\u2019ll have another. And you have other, living children that you MUST consider. They are also deeply affected by all of this, whether they show it or not.", "NAH. I think your husband just has a different way of grieving. He just needs some time and to bot talk about his dead son. I feel like you\u2019re not trying to look at this from his perspective. Like he\u2019s grieving and maybe seeing stuff about a son he never truly got to meet just stings?", "NTA.  We've never quite figured out how to mourn a baby we miscarried.  I think that your way of remembering him is touching and beautiful.", "NAH. \n\nEveryone grieves differently, and your husband has just as much of a reason and a right to his feelings around the loss and grieving as you do. \n\nIt is entirely possible he doesn't like that you are buying a physical object that you buy every year for your living children, as it will be a constant reminder of the child you lost. Especially since it sounds like it was a particularly traumatic situation in which it seems like you might have also been in danger. All of that has probably had some real effects on him and he might not be ready to discuss them yet. \n\nI don't think either of you are wrong, you are both just grieving and doing it differently. When we had our second trimester loss it was hard on both of us. The hospital puts together a small box for parents if they'd like for the child, and at first we didn't want it but after it happened I changed my mind and asked my husband if he was comfortable with getting the box. He didn't like the idea as much, but was okay with it because ultimately it was just a box that we have put somewhere. However, if he had said he still doesn't feel comfortable with the box and didn't want it, I don't think I would have gone through with getting it because while I wanted it, at the same time I knew it wasn't necessary to my grieving process. Maybe this ornament is more necessary for yours, but I do think that it could be more upsetting that your went through with it even though your husband expressed his dislike of it. \n\nThat doesn't mean you don't have to do it...this is not a black and white issue, it is so many levels of grey that no one is right or wrong really. I do think it's important he seek grief counselling because that will help him tremendously. After our loss, the hospital offered us to speak to a grief counsellor and we did and they gave us all sorts of information about how to find groups or individual counsellors, etc. If your husband finds it difficult to speak to you because you are both so close to the loss, then it would be a great idea for him to talk to someone else. \n\nEither way, you are both entitled to your feelings and your own individual grieving. It will look different, and will change over time. I think perhaps because your husband was present this time, and because it was so dangerous for you, that it has just hit him so much harder and he has no idea how to process any of it. I do think you are going about it, as in giving him space, in a good way so that is good. \n\nPerhaps write out something to him that expresses how you feel, both about the loss and also about how you feel that it has effected your relationship. Do not blame. Do not attack. Do not do anything like that, simply express your emotions and how much you want to just be able to speak to him when he's capable of it. That you miss him, and that you want both of you to work through this. Or whatever you are feeling really. You can either read it to him or give it to him, it might be easier for him to digest your emotions if you are not physically in the room.", "Usually hospitals have services for lost children where they put the ashes about twice a year that you can attend.  Even though you don\u2019t have ashes personally it might help you remember and grieve. \nThere are also community support groups for parents. \nI had 2 early miscarriages and a third who passed in utero at 22 weeks.  Those supports really helped me.", "NAH. You are both going through something incredibly heartbreaking and difficult. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "You process your grief your way and he processes his grief his way. Too bad he can't be more charitable about allowing you to process your grief. Does he not understand that you have every right to grieve YOUR way?", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry for your loss.  I think it\u2019s appropriate for you to add an ornament to a memory box.  \n\nJust, please be sensitive about letting your sorrow impact your other children.

I didn't have anyone to process it with before, and the conversation was always avoided because no one really understood. \n\nAfter some therapy, the therapist suggested I give her a name because her loss was truly traumatic for both myself and my husband. But more so, specifically me. My husband didn't question my name choice at all, and once hearing the name, he agreed it was a good choice (we named her Lucy after Scarlett Johansson's character) He understood that I needed to process it, even if he didn't process it the same way. \n\nTalk to your husband more about why this is so important to you, beyond your dream, because it is much deeper than just that.

Is this a normal reaction for him for other matters ie get angry at you if you don't do what he thinks you should do?\n\nYour connection to Mark is so much more than what it was for your husband.  You say that you were going into your 2nd trimester which would likely mean you were 12/13 weeks along when you had your miscarriage (the fact you knew the gender I imagine meant that you had a NIPT or other bloods with your 12 week ultrasound).  You also said that your husband freaked out when you told him you were pregnant so perhaps he doesn't like the reminder of a pregnancy that he may not have so sure on.  Were you actively trying for a baby?  Because if you were, then there was no reason to freak out like you describe.  If you weren't and your husband really doesn't want another baby then there are things that he can do.. like use a condom or have a vasectomy (and check that it was successful afterwards). \n\nThe things that he's said about going behind his back and wasting money on this.. they are hitting below the belt because they are not expensive (relative) and you were doing something you strongly felt you needed to for your own mental health.\n\nWould you be getting ornaments every year for Mark or would it just have been the one for this year to commemorate he was conceived?  Did you do the same for your other miscarriages or was it just this one because of your dream?  It may be different if this pregnancy went for longer than your other ones that didn't go to term.\n\nIf this is unusual for your husband then there is more going on for him and he needs some support to sort himself out because taking it out on you (or the kids) is not okay.  It may have nothing to do with you or the pregnancy loss ie it could be work related or something else but for some reason he hasn't told you or perhaps it's a combination of smaller things and something has been the straw that broke the camel's back.

Names are two yes, one no when the child is alive -- is that not the case when they're deceased?", "It's possible I did ask him and he said no but he's so shut off he might not be wanting to share it. I honestly think a lot of this is guilt because when he found out we were expecting he freaked out and really didn't want another child.", "This is what I also think. As he plainly states, the name means nothing to him. OP you can\u2019t place your ideals in her husband. I think you both need time to grieve in your own way, I wouldn\u2019t try to place your way of grieving on your husband again.", "Really? I feel like she's pretty much only taking into account his feelings at the cost of her own. He is literally shutting her out whilst she tries to be there for him, giving his space when he asks, offering to talk about it, giving him a list of resources he can use to work through his grief. He was literally off traveling for their first two miscarriages and SHES the one who doesn't take into account HIS feelings?!\n\n\"discussed it with my husband and he understood\" Yeah she actually explicitly states she discussed the name with him. She doesn't need his fuckin permission to get a small keepsake to remember her lost child after that. Sure it doesn't mean anything to him and that's fine, he doesn't have to like it and it doesn't have to have meaning to him but 'going behind his back' is not something that happened here. SMH how does this have any upvotes?! Reddit makes me so sad for humanity sometimes.\n\nBoth you and OPs husband don't give two shits about her feelings, but apparently you both care deeply about his.", "OP needs therapy bc I'm sorry, but a dream doesn't Mena anything. It was her brain trying to process loss, it wasn't the baby communicating, she had a name in mind and her brain processed the grief by imagining a son. It happens, it sucks.", "I am in therapy currently and he has a list of people to check our. We both also have agreed to do couples counciling as well.", "We did discuss names and at first he was ok with the name and it's meaning. Its only after I ordered the ornament that he was yelling at me ill make an edit", "I get where you are coming from, but in the way I see it the deceased are still family, just not with us anymore. Regardless of spiritual belief or lack of , a lot of people remember those they have lost around this time of year.", "20 dollars.", "Sorry I mean husband", "He's not 'whining' he's grieving. I doubt it has anything to do with the money and rather the actual pain and grief he is going through. They both deserve to grieve in their own way. OP already commented that the husband apologized and feels a lot of guilt surrounding the whole thing. \n\nThere is no AH in this situation. Just two parents grieving a very traumatic and difficult thing.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/). Further incidents may result in a ban.\r\n\r\n[\"Why do I have to be civil in a sub about assholes?\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/wiki/faq)\r\n\r\n**[Message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.**", "We are financially well off. My husband tends to say things about finances when we argue because I grew up very poor. He knows mentioning money is a blow for me. So that's why I gave him space anger is a huge defense mechanism for him.", "His prior job had him traveling about 20 days a month. He now has a different job and is home every night which a whole other issue but he did miss both of our other losses due to trips and missed tge recovery process as well.", "It doesn\u2019t seem like he wants to name the baby though. Or deal with the trauma they both went through. \n\nSpeaking as someone who has had to go through something similar but for a different reason,\n\nNTA, you are allowed to cope with your grief however helps you. I would encourage you to seek counseling for yourself AND as a couple though. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "I didn't get the sense that husband had a name picked out or even cared to. I saw it as a difference of feeling regarding honoring the loss, not the name. Perhaps op can clarify", "Seconding this! I have the MTHFR mutation and my doctors told me that just taking methylated folate would not only help with my drug-resistant depression (and it did!!) but that it would help a lot if I ever try to get pregnant.", "Is 3 kids not enough?", "Yeah, I feel like you being in mourning is making him feel guilty for not being as affected by it, so he's trying to make you seem like the unreasonable one in this situation. It's not that he's heartless; it's that you're being hysterical.", "I think you're doing everything you can for your husband, and his form grief while great (as in large) and understandable doesn't allow space for you to participate in it. That sucks, but please try to remember he's not trying to hurt you, he's just unable to process his emotions right now.\n\nThe real question is, who is giving *you* support? You both deserve it, not just him. You both suffered a huge loss and have the right to grieve and be supported for a little while.", "\u2665\ufe0f", "Dude never wanted to name the baby at all", "If he already did not want another child, is it possible that the dream child telling you he would \"send you an angel\" is also concerning him? Especially if he's already feeling guilty about not wanting your lost child.", ">Really? I feel like she's pretty much only taking into account his feelings at the cost of her own.\n\nI think she is taking into account *what she thinks his feelings should be* rather than actually considering what they are.", "She named their kid unilaterally without consulting him at all. Names are two yes, one no when the child is alive -- is that not the case when they're deceased?", "It\u2019s a healthy way for her to channel her grief, and it gives her comfort.. \n\nI won\u2019t deny that her and her husband could use a marriage counselor to help with communication\u2014 but maybe don\u2019t shame someone who just went through a traumatic event and hospital stay and is still having health issues as a result of this (very recent) loss?", "Absolutely edit! That does change things. Thanks for the info", "I, myself, lost my mom two years ago. my dad ten years before that, my grandparents ten years before that, my brother three years before that, and my grandmother five years before that.\n\nI don\u2019t want to spend Christmas picking scabs, when I feel the loss of all those people throughout the year.", "I don't think this is a case of not being affected by it. People grieve differently and naming a baby that he doesn't get to hold might just be too painful for him. It doesn't mean his heart's not in this.", "It could be the complete opposite. His actions could be a direct result of him experiencing grief as well. He had no control over what happened and now he is reminded of that with her purchase and having no control over the name. \n\nPeople grieve differently. Calling him heartless seems like a bit of a jump here. He is suffering from a loss too.", "That is a choice in itself, not a \"I don't care what the name is so you pick\"\n\nNow they can't both name and not name the child so there has to be a compromise by someone. But her just deciding it's by him is not it.", "I did not tell him the 2nd part of that because I know he would not handle that information well. We are both religious but I have a lot of strong beliefs about spirits. We are not planning on having another child anytime soon. He has this weird idea too that if his brother can't handle something he can't as well. My BIL has 3 kids and for some reason my husband does not think he can handle more than 3 kids even though he wouldn't mind having another. It's complicated so I don't push things", "How many times do you feel a need to spam the thread with something so incredibly unnecessary that adds nothing to the conversation?", "Can you stop commenting this over and over? It\u2019s annoying.", "I would say anyone that has had a miscarriage, let alone 5, would benefit from counseling. I\u2019m guessing the husband is protecting himself by not getting attached until the child is born   Healthy or not, it\u2019s understandable.", "True, I get that too. I lost my dad 8 years ago so I understand where you're coming from about feeling every day. \n\nI remember Dad and the other relatives I have lost at Christmas because I want to feel close to them and the warm memories. If you feel differently that's how you feel. \n\nHolidays have so many emotions wrapped up in them already, great just makes it worse for some and I get that. \n\nSorry for your losses btw, losing a parent hurts.", "This. I want to assume it\u2019s actually a NAH situation because husband is also grieving. I had a miscarriage with an abusive ex who was clearly not affected and while I was still bleeding he\u2019s like \u201cso when am I getting laid again?\u201d Seems more to me like the way OP and husband need to grieve are just not compatible and they need to communicate, but no one is inherently wrong here????", "Came to Validate the above statement.  It **effects/affects** him, too.  Everyone is entitled to grieve in any way that suits them.", "What kind of birth control methods do you guys utilize? That needs to be a conversation. I don\u2019t think continuing to have kids against his wishes is very wise or ideal for that potential child\u2026", "I don\u2019t think he\u2019s responding appropriately to your grief. I think you\u2019re allowed your space to grieve. So NTA for that.\n\nIn regards to having more children, if you can\u2019t even sleep in an extra 30 minutes on Sunday, the kids aren\u2019t listening etc., I can see why it\u2019s not the best idea for another kid. There is quite a few kids to handle. I have one and due to wanting to return to work and having some time to myself I\u2019m already on the fence about a second even though I would like my kid to have a sibling. I think it\u2019s fair to not want more than three.", "And I\u2019m sorry for yours. \n\nIt\u2019s not the loss, so much as the memories right before their deaths. \n\nDad conked his head on his bathroom vanity and never regained consciousness. My last memory of him was lying in a hospital bed with his head partially shaved with a deep recess and a scar from where they had to drill a hole in his skull to drain the blood, and my Mom had cancer that metastasized from her colon to her brain and her last words to me were, \u201cWho are you?\u201d  And, my brother committed suicide by sitting in his running car in his garage after ODing on pills. \n\nHolidays don\u2019t make that better.", "\ud83e\udec2\ud83d\udc96 I'm so sorry you went through that", "Not if it involves denying OP her right to grieve in her own way.", "I was going to say it could be that because this is his first time being there for it, it could be a lot more heavy than before. Unlike OP, who is still heavily effected by it, who has been there every time. I\u2019m so sorry this happened OP but NTA. I\u2019m not even the most spiritual person, but I know the presence of my brother when I feel it (and I didn\u2019t even know him). I would continue to support hubby but if you need support back, make sure to vocalize it. It sounds like you have lots of resources as well which is awesome :)", "Yeah but everyone is also entitled to not grieve if they don't feel effected. And not to keep being told that they should.", "Man, those are hard ways to go. The memories stick with you and I get why holidays don't make that better. That's a lot of hell for one person to live through.\n\n I remember Dad's last moments, at least he was at home when he died from his cancer, he was so scared to die. The worst part of it is my little cousin was there after she just lost her sister to a drug overdose, we buried her sister the day before. It feels so odd to have lived longer than sometime who you knew as a constant in your whole life.", "Thank you. \ud83d\udda4 I\u2019m in a much better place now but like some partners are really awful when you\u2019re going through this and I just truly think OP and husband grieve differently", "How did he deny OP her right to grieve, exactly? Explain please?", "Saying she \u201cwent behind his back\u201d when she ordered a simple Christmas ornament is a pretty good example.", "All of his responses. Criticising all her ways of grieving, instead of extending any understanding\u2014everything she\u2019s saying is peppered with \u201cI know he\u2019s hurting, I know he cares really\u201d, and trying to be patient with him. But all his responses are criticisms of the way she is expressing pain. \n\nHe could try giving her some space to process and grieve the way she needs to.", "I lost my father bot long ago. \n\nIn the beginning, I hated it when anyone brought it up. I needed more time to be able to process and talk about him. That was my grief. Was it invalid?\n\nPerhaps he is the same. He might need time without being constantly reminded of the loss to process the grief.", "I get that, and from the sounds of it that\u2019s what she\u2019s trying to give him. But he\u2019s also criticising her when she isn\u2019t reminding him of it (\u201clately everything I do is wrong\u201d)\n\nMeanwhile she\u2019s trying to process her own and also give him time while he\u2019s acting like that. He can grieve his way whilst also giving her some grace, considering she has also just lost a baby. All I\u2019m saying is he could try extending her a little grace too, which is not unreasonable. \n\nIf it was just him not wanting to talk about it I\u2019d get that. But I\u2019m a bit frustrated that people are expecting her to keep giving him what he needs when he isn\u2019t even noticing she has needs."]}
