My husband (40) was there through the entire process. We currently have 3 children (7, 5, and 2). As a couple this is our 3rd misscariage ( 2 we're from prior relationships). I was heading into my 2nd trimester when I started having symptoms of a MMC. We had found out through testing it was a boy. It was very traumatic as I went into labor and hemmoraged and was taken by ambulance to the hospital I also ended up having surgery because my misscarriage was incomplete. I'm a spiritual person a a few nights later I had a dream where a little boy came to me wearing all white saying \"HI mommy I'm (let's say mark) and I'm going to send you an angel one day\" I woke up and knew thar was my son's name. I discussed it with my husband and he understood but was distant. My husband is very avoidant. I gave him space and time. Every year I get each of my kids an ornament for Christmas that represents something important they did or liked. I decided to order \"Mark\" an ornament. I never said I wanted it displayed in fact it will most likely go in a box I'm making him. I shared this with my husband and he said \"that name doesn't mean anything to me. It only does to you.\" I understood it was coming from him grieving and while I was upset by what he said I still gave him space. He has further insisted that he doesn't like that I went behind his back. I told him I had no intention of hanging it up. He went on to say I wasted money. I asked if he wanted to talk about his feelings but he has shut down again. I understand that he is grieving and needs time but I feel like lately everything that I do is wrong around him ie. Kids not listening the house being a mess or me even sleeping an extra 30 minutes on the weekends. My husband was not present for our prior losses as a couple because he traveled so much so I'm not sure about how he processed these losses. I have given him a list of resources he can use and offer to help in any way possible. I just can't help but feeling like I am TA in all this.\n\nEdit: we also had to decide on funeral arrangements for our son. Because we have a special needs child at home we both decided that the hospital handle the cremation and/or burial.

It's an incredibly painful time for you both and you will both process it in your own ways. There was a time after my first loss when my in-laws put a bench surrounded by chicken wire near a cabin we have and told me they'd built a memory garden for me. I was horrified. That was the absolute last thing in the world I wanted. Not to mention that it was a garden in name only and was a sad, lonely bench surrounded by dry dirt and wire. I hate it. It causes me pain to see it. That \"garden\" is as barren as my womb. But I just said thank you and never spoke of it again. Because of my losses they will never be grandparents and it hurts for them too. To each their own. I wanted to put it behind me and move on. They wanted to honor the memory. No one is wrong. Grief is inherently personal.", "NAH. But your beliefs are in conflict. He probably feels strange that you have a personal and spiritual connection to your \u201cson\u201d who was, to him, never a real child, but a pregnancy that miscarried. A fetus that became non-viable. Not a person, and certainly not a person with a name and who spoke to him, as you believe he did in your dream. He may feel confused and weirdly left out. How can you have a son named Mark that you seem to know and love and grieve, while he just has an unnamed fetus and the potential for a son to grieve? You\u2019re handling your loss in very different ways.", "NAH.\nYour husband is right that you should name the child together. And the order an ornament with the agreed upon name. But your not an AH for needing an ornament to commemorate your lost child. I have one for each of ine as well.", "I have had two miscarriages. After the first one I was shopping at Walmart and in the Christmas ornament section they sold these plastic hearts, made to look like gemstones. Each had a month printed on them, each color coordinated to the month. I picked out a diamond April for me and one for my daughter and husband. Then went back and got an amethyst one for my son, Marrock, we lost at 14 weeks gestation. I lost him in June 2018 My husband cried when he saw it, I didn\u2019t even have to explain. My second miscarriage came in May 2020. I never knew gender for this one, but that Christmas, hung a new green May heart. All 5 sit near each other on the tree and my now 7yo daughter understands what they are for. \n\nNTA.", "NAH. But please, PLEASE get counseling - the both of you - before you consider another pregnancy. If you\u2019ve already had five miscarriages, odds are you\u2019ll have another. And you have other, living children that you MUST consider. They are also deeply affected by all of this, whether they show it or not.", "NAH. I think your husband just has a different way of grieving. He just needs some time and to bot talk about his dead son. I feel like you\u2019re not trying to look at this from his perspective. Like he\u2019s grieving and maybe seeing stuff about a son he never truly got to meet just stings?", "NTA.  We've never quite figured out how to mourn a baby we miscarried.  I think that your way of remembering him is touching and beautiful.", "NAH. \n\nEveryone grieves differently, and your husband has just as much of a reason and a right to his feelings around the loss and grieving as you do. \n\nIt is entirely possible he doesn't like that you are buying a physical object that you buy every year for your living children, as it will be a constant reminder of the child you lost. Especially since it sounds like it was a particularly traumatic situation in which it seems like you might have also been in danger. All of that has probably had some real effects on him and he might not be ready to discuss them yet. \n\nI don't think either of you are wrong, you are both just grieving and doing it differently. When we had our second trimester loss it was hard on both of us. The hospital puts together a small box for parents if they'd like for the child, and at first we didn't want it but after it happened I changed my mind and asked my husband if he was comfortable with getting the box. He didn't like the idea as much, but was okay with it because ultimately it was just a box that we have put somewhere. However, if he had said he still doesn't feel comfortable with the box and didn't want it, I don't think I would have gone through with getting it because while I wanted it, at the same time I knew it wasn't necessary to my grieving process. Maybe this ornament is more necessary for yours, but I do think that it could be more upsetting that your went through with it even though your husband expressed his dislike of it. \n\nThat doesn't mean you don't have to do it...this is not a black and white issue, it is so many levels of grey that no one is right or wrong really. I do think it's important he seek grief counselling because that will help him tremendously. After our loss, the hospital offered us to speak to a grief counsellor and we did and they gave us all sorts of information about how to find groups or individual counsellors, etc. If your husband finds it difficult to speak to you because you are both so close to the loss, then it would be a great idea for him to talk to someone else. \n\nEither way, you are both entitled to your feelings and your own individual grieving. It will look different, and will change over time. I think perhaps because your husband was present this time, and because it was so dangerous for you, that it has just hit him so much harder and he has no idea how to process any of it. I do think you are going about it, as in giving him space, in a good way so that is good. \n\nPerhaps write out something to him that expresses how you feel, both about the loss and also about how you feel that it has effected your relationship. Do not blame. Do not attack. Do not do anything like that, simply express your emotions and how much you want to just be able to speak to him when he's capable of it. That you miss him, and that you want both of you to work through this. Or whatever you are feeling really. You can either read it to him or give it to him, it might be easier for him to digest your emotions if you are not physically in the room.", "Usually hospitals have services for lost children where they put the ashes about twice a year that you can attend.  Even though you don\u2019t have ashes personally it might help you remember and grieve. \nThere are also community support groups for parents. \nI had 2 early miscarriages and a third who passed in utero at 22 weeks.  Those supports really helped me.", "NAH. You are both going through something incredibly heartbreaking and difficult. I\u2019m sorry for your loss.", "You process your grief your way and he processes his grief his way. Too bad he can't be more charitable about allowing you to process your grief. Does he not understand that you have every right to grieve YOUR way?", "NTA- I\u2019m sorry for your loss.  I think it\u2019s appropriate for you to add an ornament to a memory box.  \n\nJust, please be sensitive about letting your sorrow impact your other children.

I didn't have anyone to process it with before, and the conversation was always avoided because no one really understood. \n\nAfter some therapy, the therapist suggested I give her a name because her loss was truly traumatic for both myself and my husband. But more so, specifically me. My husband didn't question my name choice at all, and once hearing the name, he agreed it was a good choice (we named her Lucy after Scarlett Johansson's character) He understood that I needed to process it, even if he didn't process it the same way. \n\nTalk to your husband more about why this is so important to you, beyond your dream, because it is much deeper than just that.

Is this a normal reaction for him for other matters ie get angry at you if you don't do what he thinks you should do?\n\nYour connection to Mark is so much more than what it was for your husband.  You say that you were going into your 2nd trimester which would likely mean you were 12/13 weeks along when you had your miscarriage (the fact you knew the gender I imagine meant that you had a NIPT or other bloods with your 12 week ultrasound).  You also said that your husband freaked out when you told him you were pregnant so perhaps he doesn't like the reminder of a pregnancy that he may not have so sure on.  Were you actively trying for a baby?  Because if you were, then there was no reason to freak out like you describe.  If you weren't and your husband really doesn't want another baby then there are things that he can do.. like use a condom or have a vasectomy (and check that it was successful afterwards). \n\nThe things that he's said about going behind his back and wasting money on this.. they are hitting below the belt because they are not expensive (relative) and you were doing something you strongly felt you needed to for your own mental health.\n\nWould you be getting ornaments every year for Mark or would it just have been the one for this year to commemorate he was conceived?  Did you do the same for your other miscarriages or was it just this one because of your dream?  It may be different if this pregnancy went for longer than your other ones that didn't go to term.\n\nIf this is unusual for your husband then there is more going on for him and he needs some support to sort himself out because taking it out on you (or the kids) is not okay.  It may have nothing to do with you or the pregnancy loss ie it could be work related or something else but for some reason he hasn't told you or perhaps it's a combination of smaller things and something has been the straw that broke the camel's back.

Names are two yes, one no when the child is alive -- is that not the case when they're deceased?", "It's possible I did ask him and he said no but he's so shut off he might not be wanting to share it. I honestly think a lot of this is guilt because when he found out we were expecting he freaked out and really didn't want another child.", "This is what I also think. As he plainly states, the name means nothing to him. OP you can\u2019t place your ideals in her husband. I think you both need time to grieve in your own way, I wouldn\u2019t try to place your way of grieving on your husband again.", "Really? I feel like she's pretty much only taking into account his feelings at the cost of her own. He is literally shutting her out whilst she tries to be there for him, giving his space when he asks, offering to talk about it, giving him a list of resources he can use to work through his grief. He was literally off traveling for their first two miscarriages and SHES the one who doesn't take into account HIS feelings?!\n\n\"discussed it with my husband and he understood\" Yeah she actually explicitly states she discussed the name with him. She doesn't need his fuckin permission to get a small keepsake to remember her lost child after that. Sure it doesn't mean anything to him and that's fine, he doesn't have to like it and it doesn't have to have meaning to him but 'going behind his back' is not something that happened here. SMH how does this have any upvotes?! Reddit makes me so sad for humanity sometimes.\n\nBoth you and OPs husband don't give two shits about her feelings, but apparently you both care deeply about his.", "OP needs therapy bc I'm sorry, but a dream doesn't Mena anything. It was her brain trying to process loss, it wasn't the baby communicating, she had a name in mind and her brain processed the grief by imagining a son. It happens, it sucks.", "I am in therapy currently and he has a list of people to check our. We both also have agreed to do couples counciling as well.", "We did discuss names and at first he was ok with the name and it's meaning. Its only after I ordered the ornament that he was yelling at me ill make an edit", "I get where you are coming from, but in the way I see it the deceased are still family, just not with us anymore. Regardless of spiritual belief or lack of , a lot of people remember those they have lost around this time of year.", "20 dollars.", "Sorry I mean husband", "He's not 'whining' he's grieving. I doubt it has anything to do with the money and rather the actual pain and grief he is going through. They both deserve to grieve in their own way.

Or deal with the trauma they both went through. \n\nSpeaking as someone who has had to go through something similar but for a different reason,\n\nNTA, you are allowed to cope with your grief however helps you. I would encourage you to seek counseling for yourself AND as a couple though. I\u2019m so sorry for your loss.", "I didn't get the sense that husband had a name picked out or even cared to. I saw it as a difference of feeling regarding honoring the loss, not the name. Perhaps op can clarify", "Seconding this!

It's not that he's heartless; it's that you're being hysterical.", "I think you're doing everything you can for your husband, and his form grief while great (as in large) and understandable doesn't allow space for you to participate in it. That sucks, but please try to remember he's not trying to hurt you, he's just unable to process his emotions right now.\n\nThe real question is, who is giving *you* support?

That does change things. Thanks for the info", "I, myself, lost my mom two years ago. my dad ten years before that, my grandparents ten years before that, my brother three years before that, and my grandmother five years before that.\n\nI don\u2019t want to spend Christmas picking scabs, when I feel the loss of all those people throughout the year.", "I don't think this is a case of not being affected by it. People grieve differently and naming a baby that he doesn't get to hold might just be too painful for him. It doesn't mean his heart's not in this.", "It could be the complete opposite. His actions could be a direct result of him experiencing grief as well. He had no control over what happened and now he is reminded of that with her purchase and having no control over the name. \n\nPeople grieve differently. Calling him heartless seems like a bit of a jump here. He is suffering from a loss too.", "That is a choice in itself, not a \"I don't care what the name is so you pick\"\n\nNow they can't both name and not name the child so there has to be a compromise by someone. But her just deciding it's by him is not it.", "I did not tell him the 2nd part of that because I know he would not handle that information well. We are both religious but I have a lot of strong beliefs about spirits. We are not planning on having another child anytime soon. He has this weird idea too that if his brother can't handle something he can't as well.

It **effects/affects** him, too.  Everyone is entitled to grieve in any way that suits them.", "What kind of birth control methods do you guys utilize? That needs to be a conversation.

So NTA for that.\n\nIn regards to having more children, if you can\u2019t even sleep in an extra 30 minutes on Sunday, the kids aren\u2019t listening etc., I can see why it\u2019s not the best idea for another kid. There is quite a few kids to handle.

I think it\u2019s fair to not want more than three.", "And I\u2019m sorry for yours. \n\nIt\u2019s not the loss, so much as the memories right before their deaths. \n\nDad conked his head on his bathroom vanity and never regained consciousness.

I\u2019m not even the most spiritual person, but I know the presence of my brother when I feel it (and I didn\u2019t even know him).

That's a lot of hell for one person to live through.\n\n I remember Dad's last moments, at least he was at home when he died from his cancer, he was so scared to die. The worst part of it is my little cousin was there after she just lost her sister to a drug overdose, we buried her sister the day before. It feels so odd to have lived longer than sometime who you knew as a constant in your whole life.", "Thank you. \ud83d\udda4 I\u2019m in a much better place now but like some partners are really awful when you\u2019re going through this and I just truly think OP and husband grieve differently", "How did he deny OP her right to grieve, exactly?

I needed more time to be able to process and talk about him. That was my grief. Was it invalid?\n\nPerhaps he is the same.

He can grieve his way whilst also giving her some grace, considering she has also just lost a baby. All I\u2019m saying is he could try extending her a little grace too, which is not unreasonable. \n\nIf it was just him not wanting to talk about it I\u2019d get that.

My pregnancies after that were as followed my 7 years, a 4 to 5 week loss, my 5 year old, a 4 to 5 week loss, and my 2 year old. I also had cervical cancer as a teenager and hormonal problems, which make maintaining a pregnancy difficult. The most recent loss was a few weeks ago. My husband traveled alot before we had our two year old so we had next to no intimacy during those times. We are planning on permanent birth control. I have tried multiple methods of birth control. We were actively preventing pregnancy when we conceived this loss.", "NTA. So both need some grace. I\u2019m sorry he isn\u2019t being kind to you. \n\nAn ornament cost very little generally\u2026so I think that his objection is coming from something else than being a jerk about financial concerns. Hopefully he figures it all out soon.", "If that ornament was a comforting to you, then it wasn't a waste of money.\n\nBut the thing that worries me her is your husband's irritability and blaming you for everything on earth.  Especially at a time when you're mourning your lost child.\n\nI would like to suggest that the two of you get to a couple's counselor who has a specialty in bereavement.  I'm not sure what's up with your husband -- sometimes depressed people can be very irritable, but no matter why he's treating you badly, it's not OK.\n\nPlease get some help as a couple.

Naming those babies was not a big deal to my husband, but it deeply mattered to me every time and has always been a big part of my grieving process. My husband gets that those losses are a much bigger deal for me as I go through hormonal changes and morning sickness in addition to the physical pain of even a very early miscarriage in many cases. \nI\u2019m also very religious and have had strong impressions about those names that are very important to me in remembering what could have been. We have an electronic document that would be somewhat the equivalent of the old time Bible page with a family tree, which has each of the names I felt applied to our miscarried children along with the dates of when the pregnancies ended. It\u2019s sentimental and it\u2019s only something for our immediate family, but it means something to me like your ornament for \u201cMark\u201d does to you. \nI didn\u2019t have a dream about the last baby I lost, but I have truly felt that God sent me an angel when I was dealing with that loss. A couple days after miscarrying my son found a dumped kitten that was nearly frozen to death and in pretty bad shape. I absolutely wasn\u2019t looking for a new cat at the time, but this little guy was in desperate need of help so the kids brought him in and we started taking care of him. This sweet little kitten ending up snuggling with me through the next week when I wasn\u2019t able to be out of bed much and while he was recovering from his own ordeal. We quickly became extremely attached to each other, and even though everyone loves him he is also laughingly referred to as \u201cmom\u2019s cat,\u201d because he\u2019s also a momma\u2019s boy. My cat just turned 3 and he has filled a hole for me even though we were unable to have one more child as we both wanted. Your angel may look different than mine, but my furry little angel healed my heart in a way I can\u2019t fully communicate. I wish you well as you recover physically and emotionally, which can both be rough after a miscarriage", "NTA. We all handle things differently. I've struggled with infertility my entire life and then had to have a hysterectomy this year. I've never been able to have babies. I've found myself processing that grief in ways that even surprise me. For example, I've purchased some baby items. Bottles, blankets, diapers, clothing, etc and donated it to a maternity home in my area that serves low income mothers. I don't know why but it's helping me grieve what will never be.\n\nYou are allowed to grieve your way. An ornament in a memory box sounds like a very sweet way to remember this little life.", "NTA. Celebrate Mark however feels right. I\u2019ll send him positive thoughts.", "I had three pregnancy losses.  I read a lot about pregnancy loss trying to process my feelings.  And one thing that came up repeatedly was that women feel more connected to pregnancy because it is inside them.  And men often don\u2019t feel as connected until after a child is born.  Because that is more when their experience starts.  Because of that - they sometimes don\u2019t have the same sense of loss.  Men often describe losing a theoretical child or losing hopes.  Whereas women describe losing something more tangible and physical.  Obviously I don\u2019t know your husband and I don\u2019t know how he is feeling.  But it is possible that he doesn\u2019t understand what you are going through because he isn\u2019t experiencing the same sense of loss.  You seem to very much be trying to understand his perspective and let him process things his way.  You excuse his lack of empathy because it may be grief related.

He told my mom horrible, hurtful things and shut down anything positive she tried to do in regards to me/the pregnancy.

The alternative right answer is to simply stop trying to have more kids.", "it\u2019s also vicious to stonewall your partner & only communicate in constant criticism, especially considering he wasn\u2019t present or there AT ALL during her first 2 miscarriages. \n\nshe\u2019s given him the space to grieve, meanwhile he hadn\u2019t given her any grace or opportunity to deal with her trauma in her own way, while she\u2019s accepting his way of dealing with it. \n\ntoxic masculinity is not an opportunity to treat your partner with such a lack of consideration.", "And I wasn\u2019t the only one who called you out.", "I assumed based around the culture that often follows religion and then already having 3 kids. My bad for assuming though, op seems to have a really healthy communication level and they\u2019re just both dealing with a lot of pain right now", "Yeah,  I've tried to be kind in my posts, but the fact that they've already lost 5 and they're owning the door to more kids -- even though they have 3 -- is just mind blowing to me. I don't get it. \n\nI think serious therapy is needed so they can focus on what they have. They need to stop spending so much time on those losses and spend that time on their 3 children. \n\n How about a vasectomy to avoid the worry of birth control?", "Show me where it says that in the original post.\n\nHe isn't stonewalling her \n\nHe is giving her space.\n\nThey are each grieving in their own way.\n\nShe isn't accepting his way of grieving because she is pressing him to grieve how she thinks he should be grieving.\n\nIt isn't toxic masculinity, but I think you are spouting toxic feminism and projecting your own feelings into the situation.", "Yes and they can chill the fuck out too, but according to you it's a faux pas if you make similar responses to similar comments so alas they'll have to read this one.", "No you\u2019re fine. OP mentioned asking him to try for another and him being \u201copen\u201d to it. Definitely needs to be talked about thoroughly with each other after they process and heal from this.", "Definitely a faux paux. Add something new, or don\u2019t respond at all, never mind again and again with the same copy/paste that wasn\u2019t even interesting the first time we had to read it.\n\nEdit: because autocorrect thought faux Paul was the best choice\u2026\n\nEdit 2 because: weed", "Well, she can do whatever she wants. Call him Mark, get him a Christmas ornament, even knit him a Christmas sweater if she wants. Doesn't mean he has to like it. Maybe she should keep it to herself? That's her way of grieving, not his. And maybe, maybe, it causes extra pain to him.", "I was the same when I lost my mother. It is not invalid. But if someone would have come up to me and tried to make me talk about my mother and losing her, that would have been very invalidating. He is invalidating her grieving by criticizing her purchasing an ornament, giving the child they lost a name etc. These are her ways of dealing with this loss and he is invalidating them."]}
