Like when I was orthodox and more observant than I am now, I wore long sleeve cardigans over strapless dresses all the time for religious functions and that was very normal. All the ladies and girls did that. Layering was just normal.\n\nSo not only do I not see the issue (and I used to be *very* religious, like so religious anyone passing me on the street could tell because of how I dressed) with the clothes, the fact that you're using her twisted ankle against her is just really manipulative and gross.\n\nI dressed conservatively when I was very religious for myself. It was a standard I held myself to. Your daughter is an adult and manipulating her to hold herself to standards you can only hold yourself to is not appropriate.

She isn\u2019t going half naked, the dress is not even really backless, and it won\u2019t even be showing because of the sweater. How would that embarrass you?

I wore yoga pants to my FIL's funeral (full length, wide, leg, dark grey). I'd just had ankle surgery with a cast to my knee and didn't have any dress pants that would fit over it.  I also wore a sneaker because with only one working foot, I didn't want to hobble in crutches and a dress shoe. Unless it's a televised celebrity wedding, for a head of state or the queen of England, no one cares what you're wearing.", "YTA--she solved the issue with the sweater.

She\u2019s wearing a sweater. Only you know about the back.", "YTA. It is a day of mourning her sweater covered back will not be causing any issue.

Up.", "YTA.  I am a prissy southern grandmother and I think you are being ridiculous.", "There never was an issue. Op your controlling the way I expect a 75 year old misogynistic male to be.

That means that the daugher problem solved for the showing of skin \"issue\" on her own. Maybe the funeral is being held at a conservative church, and the daughter knows that? \n\nSo then wtf is OPs problem? Like the issue has been resolved. The daugher probably has other black dresses that show cleavage, or are too short, or to tight, or what the fuck ever.
