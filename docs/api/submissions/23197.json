Like when I was orthodox and more observant than I am now, I wore long sleeve cardigans over strapless dresses all the time for religious functions and that was very normal. All the ladies and girls did that. Layering was just normal.\n\nSo not only do I not see the issue (and I used to be *very* religious, like so religious anyone passing me on the street could tell because of how I dressed) with the clothes, the fact that you're using her twisted ankle against her is just really manipulative and gross.\n\nI dressed conservatively when I was very religious for myself. It was a standard I held myself to. Your daughter is an adult and manipulating her to hold herself to standards you can only hold yourself to is not appropriate.

Your daughter is planning to keep her sweater on.  Her sweater covers the back of the dress that would show some skin.  No one will see it, or realize the dress is partially backless because of the sweater.  what the heck is your problem?", "YTA how is it inappropriate if she'll be wearing a sweater that covers the opening in the back? Also that wouldn't be particularly inappropriate for many funerals, it's not like anything sexy is showing and again SHE IS WEARING A SWEATER. anyone who is ogling her closely enough to see it ride up would be the embarrassing one, not her.\n\nYour daughter's 19 and can dress herself, no one will be particularly judgy about you \"allowing\" her to wear a perfectly reasonable dress.", "YTA. She literally will have her back covered. No one will know. She even came to you with a solution knowing that a backless dress wasn\u2019t the best idea. \n\nUnless you want to take her shopping, deal with what she has. She\u2019s 19 and an adult. Not everyone has a full head to toe black outfit, and funerals are rarely expected. \n\nDon\u2019t make this harder than it has to be. Don\u2019t be that mom.", "Yta o no! A womans back!  How SCANDALOUS.  Whatever will we did in these degenerative times!! /s", "If the sweater covers the back, YTA.", "At my grandmother's funeral, one of her relatives showed up in a bright plaid shirt and old jeans. But that's not why I remember him. I remember how happy my father was to see him. He was a great comfort, and that is what funerals are for. YTA for your priorities.", "Half naked? What an overreaction. Grow up, YTA", "YTA. It's only inappropriate in your mind. No one else would know that the dress is backless. You're just on a power trip.\n\nEven without the sweater, there's nothing inappropriate about the dress anyway. \n\nOn a scale to 10, this is AH level 7", "YTA - but this sounds like the daughter is writing on behalf of the mother.  Either way, the sweater covers up the dress.  What's there to worry about?", "YTA.  This isn't nearly as revealing as you're making it out to be, and certainly isn't \"half naked.\"  Sounds like you just wanted something to be dramatic about.", "YTA\n\nWhy the fuck is it going to embarrass you?  You're more worried about YOUR image than anything else.  She's covered.  Her tits are covered.  Her ass is covered.  Her vag is covered.  She's not showing up in a bikini.  She's got the whole outfit squared away.  Get over yourself.", "YTA. Don't tell a grown woman what to wear.", "YTA\n\nHow is she \"half-naked\" when only a bit of her back is exposed...? And she's going to wear a sweater over it so it won't even be seen, you're acting like a major asshole. \n\n\"Yeah it's so sad that this person died but this girl is wearing a black dress that exposes a bit of her back! How embarrassing!\" You're delusional if you think anyone's going to care or even notice.", "YTA. How is it inappropriate if she\u2019s covered? And even if she wasn\u2019t, that\u2019s still not \u201chalf naked\u201d. Also, she\u2019s an adult, and doesn\u2019t need you to dictate how she should dress.", "And OP should probably remember that somebody is actually dead and this is a day of connection and mourning and peace and not a fashion show. Does OP think the corpse will rise up to sexualise her daughter's back? \"Booooooohhhhhh what's that under that sweater??? Skin?!?!?!?!?!?!?\"", "Yeah, the only issue exists in the head of the OP. At this point, it's not even that different from wearing a skirt with the sweater. Or would OP decide to interpret that as a topless dress or something? It makes no sense.\n\nIt sounds like OP made a quick, but clearly wrong decision, and just didn't want to back down out of some need to be in control.", "There\u2019s also nothing inappropriate with showing a mid back if she was warm. It\u2019s a funeral, ppl have better things to do than to judge how others are dressed", "What is she has to take it off or it rides up? She should be properly attired in case she has to remove her sweater. It\u2019s just disrespectful.", "I think OP's issue is control.", "I wonder how many shirts OP expects daughter has to wear on an every day basis, in case she has the need to take one off.", "Mom is too busy embarrassing herself in front of internet strangers.", "but what if she takes it off? the horror that people might see her daughters exposed back! why, she may as well parade around the funeral home naked at that point! \n\n/s in case anyone is unaware.", ">What are you going to do? Yank up her sweater and declare to the grieving masses how embarrassed you are that skin is visible?\n\nShe probably declares her daughter's indecency to the masses by loudly clanging a bell while shouting \"Shame!  Shame\".

Several, if possible.  With choreography.", "no one at a funeral is going to fucking care about three inches if exposed skin on her back.", "Disrespectful of who? The dead person? I don't think they will complain.", "In what scenario would she have to take it off?\n\nWhat if something happens and you have to take your dress off? That\u2019s just as plausible.", "No, what's disrespectful is you you slut shaming her. Your entire argument is \"but what if\" which is just weak. You're more concerned about yourself and that tells me a lot.", "OP is the one being disrespectful. YTA quit trying to be so controlling your grown adult daughter has autonomy to dress herself as she deems fit.", "Can you explain what is disrespectful about your daughter having a back? A shirt *could* ride up too. And she *could* take off any other article of clothing too.", "Who cares?  Grow the hell up, man. She\u2019s not your little girl any more.  She\u2019s an adult.   For once, treat her like one and let her live her life the way she wants.", "Did you miss in your own story where she said she wouldn't take it off even if she was hot? And she seems old enough to manage a sweater riding up.", "The only person bring disrespectful is you.", "Oh no! Skin! The horror! Next she may show an ankle!", "it's her back. she's not flashing or mooning anyone. fucking get over yourself. 'half naked'. christ.", "That's a lot of what ifs. What if it rains and the sweater dissolves from getting wet...  \n\n\nYTA", "Whose funeral are you trying to ban her from attending? \n\nI'm kinda guessing it's a family member and possibly one she was close to since she's arguing and bringing your sisters in on this. Which makes you an AH since funerals are for the living to gather and grieve and you're trying to exclude her from that, but depending on her relationship with the deceased you might be a bigger AH than I'm imagining.", "Have you offered to buy her another dress? \n\nMaybe that\u2019s the only black dress she has so this could be resolved by offering to pay for a cami to wear underneath or another dress.", "What if she doesn\u2019t show up to the funeral to honor and grieve because mom refused to take her injured daughter over a few inches of back skin? I\u2019d say mom was being disrespectful to the decreased and their family on this sad day, not daughter.", "Being able to see a small section of someone\u2019s back is disrespectful?", "What a strange battle for you to fight. Such a minor thing compared to the death of a friend/loved one.\n\nEdit: YTA", "YTA. Who cares if it rides up or she takes it off? Who is it hurting? Literally nobody. Leave her alone. Maybe it\u2019ll offend the dead person so much that they\u2019ll rise from the dead to yell at her and y\u2019all will have no need for the funeral anymore", "And what if the car breaks down on the way there and you can't get to the funeral? Don't try to pull possibilities card to get out of the fact that YTA", "Disrespectful to whom? A little of her back? She's not going nipple out to a church, calm down.", "Do you go around asking young women to take their clothes off at funerals? Why do you think shed be forced to undress there?", "Why are you obsessing about your daughters back? At best that's controlling, and worst that's creepy. Don't be controlling or creepy.", "A bit of back is not disrespectful and she's covering it with a sweater.", "And from bra line to upper waist, like that's... very little unless she's a giraffe.", "Looks like it\u2019s not sold officially anymore, but here\u2019s a post from somebody selling them on eBay!

Is there no other way to resolve this besides banning her from attending? Just seems like a big leap from a gap she\u2019s covering with a reasonable garment to worrying over every possible thing anybody could take issue with.\n\nNews flash, if your family members are the kinds of assholes who will never let you live down the time your daughter\u2019s semi-backless dress /maybe/ being briefly visible if her sweater rides up during a FUNERAL, maybe they\u2019re not the best people to keep around you. \n\nIf you let the opinions of everyone else affect how you relate with your child, be ready to feel the distance you\u2019re creating.", "What if you get in an accident on the way to the funeral and the EMTs have to cut your clothes off? What if there's a major earthquake and you need to use the sweater to wrap your hands to get thru the broken glass window? Clearly daughter should have a burqa under the sweater just in case. YTA.", "It's not about sluttiness. It's like you wouldn't wear a short sleeve shirt to a funeral.\n\nEdit: at least in my family it would be seen as an absolute no and very disrespectful.

Idk if it\u2019s a cultural thing, but funerals where I am aren\u2019t black tie events", "I live in the f\\*cking desert, I've worn short sleeves to funerals because guess what? IT'S SUMMER AND OVER 100\u00b0F (37.778\u00b0C)  Dead people don't give a f\\*ck what you're wearing. It's not like she was wearing a black mini dress with her tits and ass hanging out.", "You can wear short sleeves to a funeral? Plenty of dresses and jumpsuits and blouses aren't long sleeved but entirely appropriate.", "... why not?", "What the hell? Don't wear short sleeve shirts to a funeral?\n\nWhy would that matter? I'm really baffled about such an arbitrary made up standard that you've imagined.", "Interesting. I just know that myself and all my cousins would be cussed out if we dared to disrespect someone by not having a proper black suit black tie white shirt", "It's too casual, you need a formal shirt suit and tie", "I\u2019m sure it varies a lot by location. Tbf I think my family is very casual about funerals (no suits, black attire not required, basically \u2018business casual but not overtly flashy\u2019) \u2014 maybe it\u2019s because we all get cremated & don\u2019t do the whole open casket service?  \n\nThough the 2 non-family funerals I\u2019ve attended were also what I\u2019d call \u2018business casual\u2019. Slacks & a button up or skirt & blouse, but no full suits or formal black gowns.", "LOL. Around here funerals are not even seen as formal events, the main aspect is supporting family and friends. I was at my grandpa's funeral recently, wore pants and a nicer t-shirt, as did most people attending.", "Women wear suits and ties at funerals?", "That's crazy to me, I'd get chewed the fuck out if I did that\n\nEdit to add: I'm glad you celebrated in a way that was comforting to those involved."]}
