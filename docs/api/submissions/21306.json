Screw that. No one can dictate your forgiveness.", "You don't actually have to be the bigger person towards someone who spent her life being an a-hole. She stole from family and made her sick, elderly mum do her chores...and then didn't even bother seeing her when she was on her death bed. Is she reaching out because she's getting older and realising she actually needs people? This is the price to pay for actions that hurt people.", "NTA, dont meet up and tell your brother he does not get to decide when or how you should forgive. Or even forgive in general. This person sounds like a toxic ahole that only contacts you because she wants something from you. Probably money, seeing her stealing all that in the previous years. You are good with your boundaries OP, keep it up!", ">It may sound selfish but I don't think she has nothing positive to bring to my life.\n\nThis does not sound even remotely selfish to me. Anyone that you voluntarily spend time with *should* bring something positive to your life. She has not behaved like a nice person to her own family. You do not need to let her off the hook for that. If she were to take dramatic actions to right past wrongs - like take on an extra job to pay your parents back without any expectations of a relationship with your family - it would at least suggest that she has remorse. Just reaching out because of what *she* wants is selfish and unfair to you.  NTA", "You can forgive her AND not ever speak to her again.
