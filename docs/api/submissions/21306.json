Screw that. No one can dictate your forgiveness.", "You don't actually have to be the bigger person towards someone who spent her life being an a-hole. She stole from family and made her sick, elderly mum do her chores...and then didn't even bother seeing her when she was on her death bed.

This is the price to pay for actions that hurt people.", "NTA, dont meet up and tell your brother he does not get to decide when or how you should forgive. Or even forgive in general.

You are good with your boundaries OP, keep it up!", ">It may sound selfish but I don't think she has nothing positive to bring to my life.\n\nThis does not sound even remotely selfish to me. Anyone that you voluntarily spend time with *should* bring something positive to your life. She has not behaved like a nice person to her own family. You do not need to let her off the hook for that. If she were to take dramatic actions to right past wrongs - like take on an extra job to pay your parents back without any expectations of a relationship with your family - it would at least suggest that she has remorse. Just reaching out because of what *she* wants is selfish and unfair to you.  NTA", "You can forgive her AND not ever speak to her again.

Forgiveness without repentance puts people at risk of being victimized futher.", "NTA tell your brother you'd rather hug a rabid bear and that would be the safer option. There's obviously a lot of good reasons your family stays away from this poisonous witch - what difference does it make how old she is?", "NTA \"Being the bigger/better person' means continuing to accept abuse.

You can be the bigger person by not saying \"I told you so\" when Lola screws him over.", "I hate this adage about being the better person.\n\nYou can forgive but not forget.

Lola has been a massive AH throughout her life and you are not obligated to have her in your life.

In this situation, you have made the right decision for you. End of discussion.\n\nAs for the phrase, \"be the better person\".

In my very limited experience, if someone says \"be the bigger person\", \"it builds character\", \"your feelings are valid\", \"freedom of speech\", or \"its a free county.\" 75% of the time they are being an AH.

It doesn't mean you have to go out of your way to tell her this, which may allow her to try guilt tripping you into reestablishing contact on her terms.\n\nYou don't have to do anything, OP. Prioritize your mental wellbeing.", "Absolutely. Being the bigger person should be reserved for situations like dealing with kids or animals or people you actually care about lashing out a bit while grieving or hurting, not for people you are estranged from because they hurt you or others you love in the past who *maybe* have changed for the better, but most likely not.", "Why did they think you have to be the bigger person?\n\nNTA", "Ask husband to name even one benefit to you of reconnection.  Then ask him to consider her known behaviors and if he can come up with any reason she wants to reconnect that, based on her character,  won\u2019t be exploitive.  He will likely say she has changed.  \n\nTell him you will reconsider if she can actually show that she has changed, or when she can show that.\n\nPerhaps she can invite you all out to dinner at a really nice restaurant and pay for it.  Perhaps she can be content with just having conversations for awhile; conversations where she appears interested in all of you and doesn\u2019t deliver any insults. \n\nMy guess is that her approaching you all without offering any evidence of change indicates she now needs money, or a place to live, or needs help in some way.  Your husband should not be happy to assume the best of her without some initiative on her part to make amends before expecting anything from the people she has hurt and betrayed in the past.  \n\nIt is on HER, not all of you, to prove she has changed for the better.  Many Reddits dealing with stories like this demonstrate that people like her looking up relatives and friends years later usually offer nothing and immediately put their hand in other peoples pockets.  It will be something urgent like about to be living on the streets so can they move in.\n\nDo a little sleuthing online to see what you can learn about her current situation.", "NTA. God no.
