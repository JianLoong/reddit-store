We only invited close family and friends, and asked that they wear jewel toned dresses and suit jackets. The wedding was in a sort of forest. We also took photos with almost everyone, not just the wedding party (which only consisted of a best man and a maid of honor).\n\nMy SIL (mid 20s), shows up in a blush pink dress, and her BF in a cream suit jacket. She thought that that would make her pop I guess (she is an attention seeker, by testimony of everyone but her mom). Joke on her, my dress was gold and shimmery, and my husband was in an emerald green jacket. Also I was wearing a full on crown, no mistaking who the bride was.\n\nWhen the photographer asked me if she should photoshop them a bit, to make them blend in more (since we went with a dramatic photo style, that emphasized the deep jewel tones, and the \u201cdarkness\u201d of the forest), I told her not to bother, make them look nice, but don\u2019t change the colors or anything like that.\n\nWell, I received the photos 4 days ago. I posted some on my insta, and most on fb (since most of our older relatives use it exclusively), and they (SIL and BF) looked so out of place, they were almost washed out.\n\nThen, she had the nerve to comment on my post, it was very passive aggressive, something along the lines of washing her out to make myself stand out more. I replied by saying that she washed herself out, by ignoring the wedding theme. She deleted her comment. \n\nBut then, we met last night, at my in-laws, it was an accident, not planned or anything. She said pretty much the same thing, I repeated that she was washed out because the photo style we chose emphasized deep colors, that\u2019s why we asked people to wear jewel tones. It escalated, and ended up with me telling her that she looked like shit in our photos (her complaint) because she was a jealous little woman who thought she could upstage me with a $30 dress the color of diluted pepto. She started crying and left.\n\nNow my MIL says I owe SIL an apology for \u201cpublicly shaming her\u201d and well as for insulting her looks.

She wouldn't shut up on her own. So you helped her. And this isn't publicly shaming her. It was in the privacy of your in-laws.

But I'm not nice either.", "This is too funny!  Thank you for giving me a laugh \n\nNTA. Please continue posting your wedding photos anywhere & everywhere exactly as they are. \n\nDo NOT apologise to anyone. Your MIL is out of line here - she should have told the SIL to be quiet. The SIL threw a tantrum and you put her in her place. Well done. If you apologise it sets a precedent that SIL throws her weight around & you\u2019ll be pressured to apologise.\n\nAlso those saying, they are your ILs and you should do it because it\u2019s a long term relationship blah blah. Well guess what it\u2019s a two way thing and it\u2019s not just on you. They need to make compromises & adjustments too.

Jewel tones? Like people have that specific thing lying around in their closet? *In this economy?* \n\nYou all sound exhausting and petty.

Pinks, lavender, light blue?\n\nif I was decorating my house and used jewel tones it would be deep reds, greens, and blues. But faerie court jewel tones? Pink sapphire and rose quartz would be appropriate along with amethyst and blue sapphire.   \nSIL probably misunderstood the color choices . . . and can everyone afford to purchase an outfit to attend a wedding (not part of the ceremony)?  \nPretty much ALL photos done by a wedding photographer are re-touched. There is a range of tones that can be chosen to improve a photo (lighten up if faces are in shadow, darken it if sun has washed out colors). No doubt your photographer wanted you to look best and adjusted tones based on the gold and green you two were wearing. And, SIL may have looked washed out because of this. She shouldn\u2019t have posted a comment on this - just fact of life - the bride and groom get all the glory on their day, and memorabilia from that day.\n\nBut you did shame her for the mistake she made on color choice based on what she thought was faerie court jewel colors, sapphire pink, red quartz, amethyst, blue sapphire.", "ESH\n\nWhile it's hard to imagine anyone working too hard to upstage a faerie wedding (why bother?), I think OP needs to get over herself too.   \n\nAnytime there is a theme wedding, it's usually going to result in someone being the A-hole.

If she wore a white dress, then I could see.\n\nSo I guess NTA For not fixing the colors so that she blended in on the pictures, but YTA for your attitude.

If she had not made the complaint about being \"washed out\" then it would be reverse. But its your wedding not hers.

Probably a loose loose no matter what route you chose", "ESH she didn't follow your dress code but wearing blush pink to a wedding seems like a relatively minor faux pas. Definitely seems like you don't like your SIL. Then she complains, twice! about not liking how she looks in the photos (so tacky of her to complain) and you sunk to her level by insulting what she wore. The non-asshole response would be to simply assure her she looks lovely in the photos. Yes you were rude and should apologize. She sounds annoying but we all have at least one or two in-laws that are going to be annoying at times.", "ESH. This American obsession with colour-coded weddings seems basically designed to produce outcomes like this. I find these kind of family dramas trivial and fucking annoying and everyone in this story bears some responsibility for the nonsense that ensued.", "YTA, fairy forest and jewel tones\u2026\nSounds entitled and almost narcissistic. \nI am sure you think you did something very special, nobody else did before. \nBlaming people who might not be able to afford costumes or do not want to look like some idiots who pretend to play Lord of the rings, is really astonishing.", "NTA she did this to herself and is trying to play victim.", "The ONLY thing I feel bad about (also you\u2019re NTA) is that if you do a search even on Pinterest for jewel toned wedding/themes/dresses there are lots of examples that DO include a blush pink", "ESH you didn\u2019t do anything wrong with the photos but the way you talk about her makes you an absolute asshole", "ESH - Holy shit. Do y'all not have anything real to worry about?\n\nWhen you complicate the dress code to tell people what colors to wear, not everyone is going to comply. You had the choice to be gracious about it.

Instead, you both chose to indulge in mean girl energy last seen in the 7th grade cafeteria.\n\nAbsolutely no one is going to remember or care what anyone wore to your wedding once those pictures stop making the rounds on social media. Both of you need to calm the egos, and *you* need to remember what the day is supposed to be about - a celebration of marriage, not a meltdown over a dress.\n\nYou owe each other an apology.

She f\\*cuked around and found out but YOU had to rub it in her face.\n\nYou just entered into this family. Presumably you are going to be interacting with MIL and SIL for decades. Is this really worth it? She's young and immature but you took the bait. If you want to have a peaceful existence in your family you are going to have to figure out how to rise above her childishness. You did that during the wedding but you still had to put her in her place. Now you have aligned your MIL and SIL against you as evil. Stuff like this is going to keep coming up and the stakes are going to be higher and higher.\n\nDo you owe her an apology? No. Should you apologize. Yes.

If I could, I would show her two other photographs. One where they were edited to blend in so everybody looks the same, so she could see how their colors would have had to be darkened, and one where her and her boyfriend look the way she wanted, but everybody else in the photo is too dark.", "ESH\n\nI wouldn't say you publicly shamed her by posting those pics. She should've messaged you privately instead of making it a public dispute. If it were me, I'd immediately understand why I didn't look the same as the others in edited pics where I wore a shade very different to everybody else, and tbh I'd probably just feel a bit embarrassed but know it was on me so I wouldn't complain or make a fuss about it.\n\nBut you could've worded it very differently and IMO you acted immaturely. Obviously you can do whatever you want with your wedding pictures, but why not just let her be edited to make it look nicer for **you** to look at for the rest of your life? Now you'll also always be reminded that she stood out, on purpose or not, at your wedding. And IMO your insult to her was immature as well. We don't always have to be the bigger person when someone does us wrong, sometimes being the bigger person can harm *us* in the end, but everyone in this story sound immature to me.\n\nETA: INFO do you know if she's in a position to afford a new dress in your dress code?

There was no communication between OP and SIL regarding the color palate anywhere in this narrative prior to the conflict.   Keep in mind that \"Jewel Tones\" DO include pinks and pastels, and the SIL is of the generation where those colors are acknowledged as such.  Also; SIL is at the age where she may not have been readily able to purchase another dress.\n\n\\#2.  OP has a preconceived idea of \"who\" her SIL is, but didn't ACTUALLY speak with her about her SIL's color choice: \n\n>She thought that that would make her pop I guess (she is an attention seeker, by testimony of everyone but her mom).\n\n\\#3.  OP made a **conscious** decision to not have the photo altered.  Then goes on to mention how bad the couple looked in the final product.  AND posted them anyway.

We only invited close family and friends, and asked that they wear jewel toned dresses and suit jackets. The wedding was in a sort of forest. We also took photos with almost everyone, not just the wedding party (which only consisted of a best man and a maid of honor).\n\nMy SIL (mid 20s), shows up in a blush pink dress, and her BF in a cream suit jacket. She thought that that would make her pop I guess (she is an attention seeker, by testimony of everyone but her mom). Joke on her, my dress was gold and shimmery, and my husband was in an emerald green jacket. Also I was wearing a full on crown, no mistaking who the bride was.\n\nWhen the photographer asked me if she should photoshop them a bit, to make them blend in more (since we went with a dramatic photo style, that emphasized the deep jewel tones, and the \u201cdarkness\u201d of the forest), I told her not to bother, make them look nice, but don\u2019t change the colors or anything like that.\n\nWell, I received the photos 4 days ago. I posted some on my insta, and most on fb (since most of our older relatives use it exclusively), and they (SIL and BF) looked so out of place, they were almost washed out.\n\nThen, she had the nerve to comment on my post, it was very passive aggressive, something along the lines of washing her out to make myself stand out more. I replied by saying that she washed herself out, by ignoring the wedding theme. She deleted her comment. \n\nBut then, we met last night, at my in-laws, it was an accident, not planned or anything. She said pretty much the same thing, I repeated that she was washed out because the photo style we chose emphasized deep colors, that\u2019s why we asked people to wear jewel tones. It escalated, and ended up with me telling her that she looked like shit in our photos (her complaint) because she was a jealous little woman who thought she could upstage me with a $30 dress the color of diluted pepto. She started crying and left.\n\nNow my MIL says I owe SIL an apology for \u201cpublicly shaming her\u201d and well as for insulting her looks. So AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "NTA the fact you didn\u2019t have her specially edited and her own choices made her look dreadful is amazing.

Which is really suspicious to me.\n\nSecond, your wedding theme was Faerie Court/Jewel Tones. Did you actually make sure to emphasize deep, dark jewel tones? A theme involving Faeries can imply lighter shades of jewel tones such as pink diamond/saphire. \n\nFinally, the remark about your SIL's dress looking \"cheep\" is completely tacky OP. Your SIL more than likely bought the best she could afford along with her BF with what they understood of the theme.\n\nYour whole post needs a lot more info and backstory on the history between you and your SIL.

If SIL had asked her mom she would have been told what Jewel Colors were.\n\nAs for the apology, I think OP was a bit harsh, but SIL started the whole thing publicly first on SM then kept at it like a dog with a bone at the house.  She was wanting to blame OP for her bad clothing choice.  To the point she claimed she was deliberately washed out.  If that isn't an AH move I don't know what is.   This is where I have problems judging.   I do think OP was a bit of an AH, but I felt she was pushed to that point by the SIL who was a total AH.  Close is E S H but I really think the preponderance of Assholery is on SIL, followed closely by MIL for taking up for her when she was clearly out of pocket. \n\nIf pressed I would say NTA  because justified AH isn't an option.", "Emerald, Ruby, sapphire. The darkest versions of those stones are what\u2019s meant by jewel tones", "this is the best take lol", "Yeah, \"fairy\" to me is a specific type of creature, like Tinkerbell or her ilk.\n\nA \"faerie\", however, could be anything from Tinkerbell to strange magical dogs, to elves, to even being a word to encompass an entire world.", "[baby blue](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/assets/images/colors/baby-blue-color-solid-background-1920x1080.png) vs [sapphire blue](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/assets/images/colors/sapphire-blue-color-solid-background-1920x1080.png)\n\nOh yeah, they look totally the same...", "That is not an apology, haha.", "I thought your story was going to end w/people cosplaying Cuban sandwiches.", "Well, we know who the racists in that family are.", "Did nobody just... ask the people who decided on this theme in the first place?", "I don\u2019t for a moment believe that every person attending this wedding understood the dress code except the SIL. I also don\u2019t think that jewel tones is ambiguous. If you don\u2019t personally know what that means, that\u2019s fine. But the answer is a click away! Google can give you a pretty clear answer, as could the hosts if she wanted clarification. There are definitely ambiguous dress codes I\u2019d want clarification on, but ultimately, if the hosts aren\u2019t that bothered with clarifying then you probably won\u2019t stand out! It was only an issue because every single person followed the dress code except this couple and then the SIL is upset she didn\u2019t stand out the way she wanted to.", "I\u2019m inviting myself and I\u2019m coming dresssd as a mini hotdog.", "It's a swatch palette for digital artists. Helps to develop colors that work together well.

Right next to my ruby red sports coat. How many suits do people think 20-something year old guys have sitting in their closets?  I know at that age I had two suits that were buy one, get one cheap-o\u2019s. Unless someone\u2019s a part of the wedding party, then a color scheme is a suggestion as far as I\u2019m concerned. I\u2019m sure as hell not running out and buying a suit of abnormal color to wear once.", "It isn't? Like, would pearls be out of place when talking about jewellery?\n\nSIL probably was an AH, but the colour pallet stuff doesn't seem at all something everyone agrees about, even in this thread.", "Exactly to me a \u201cfairy theme\u201d and \u201cfaerie theme\u201d are two completely different things", "\"Party!\"\n\n- Adore Delano, probably", "Omg, I am laughing so hard I'm crying. Way to make your point, dude. Brilliant. Bet the company learned an important lesson ftom that.", "I\u2019m familiar with color palettes, but that\u2019s not what that is. It\u2019s a zip folder with 12 different images, each 3600 pixels square, and a single color, intended to be used as a background paper layer for projects, according to the product description. I\u2019ve used similar textured background papers before, but never something so\u2026 simple? A color palette based on swatches would be a single image with all of the colors on it, or a color book in a format compatible with PS or other software.\n\nEdit to add: also, there are tools like [this](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) to help create palettes based on popular or recognized color palette patterns.", "But like, you can just select the color from the image in the listing, without any need to pay for it.\n\nI don't get it either!", "And if you don't add color palette but look at pictures of actual jewels there are some in soft pink colors.

Blush pink is not a jewel tone for material because it fits neither requirement. \n\n*Blush* pink falls under the \u201cpastel\u201d category.", "Exactly Faerie would be an amazing theme for an adult wedding", "I don't think it's her job to investigate the situation if it wasn't going to alter her behavior either way. She didn't confront the SIL with it, she just enjoyed her wedding and posted normal unaltered photos of it. I don't see how harboring suspicions in her private thoughts escalates the situation."]}
