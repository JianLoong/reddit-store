Classic FAFO.\n\nNTA.", "Surprise, surprise!!!", "NTA, if this guy didn\u2019t wanna be called out and humiliated like that, he shouldn\u2019t have spoken so confidently on a topic he clearly doesn\u2019t understand at all. Hopefully that teaches him to think before he speaks, especially on issues regarding women!", "PSA. While having different sized boobs is perfectly normal, in an adult who isn\u2019t still growing their boobs one of them getting bigger and the other not is 100% not normal. Size change in one boob was my first sign of cancer. I thought it was fine because boobs can be different sizes, right?  No!  Get that stuff checked out.", "An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. Youve done nothing to change the atmosphere that you don't appreciate.", "You're in college and people are acting like this? NTA but lol", "Dear, can I elect you to be the teacher if the male population? Please tell me you know where there clit is and when you turn 35, I will be your campaign manager!!\n\nNTA", "NTA", "NTA\n\nAnd Ronaldo should learn how to take a comeback before giving you shht\n\n\nAlso you were absolutely correct, obviously.", "NTA \n\nI bet no one said shit when roles were reversed. If he can deal he needs to be ok with getting dealt back, if he can\u2019t he should take a step back and change his ways. \n\nAnd who the hell doesn\u2019t know that about women\u2019s breasts ? It\u2019s not a secret", "NTA, if you can't take the heat stay out of the kitchen. And honestly as humiliating as that may be for him, maybe it could be a learning moment to be less arrogant.", "NTA. Your friends are incorrect.", "Bro is straight up wrong and literally cannot handle being told so. NTA, OP I'm surprised you actually had to post this, you're fine", "Breasts can be different sizes, I have been with women with slightly different sized breasts", "As someone with differently shaped breasts, NTA. It's possible for anyone with breasts to have different shapes and sizes, so you are correct there. \n\nThe women that spoke up probably have symmetrical breasts hence why they sided with them, but as you age the shape can change. \n\nIt seems to me you know anatomy more than these other people, since you're the one studying it for art. Also if their harassment bothers you, you don't have to take it OP. You deserve better.", "NTA if he can\u2019t handle being dog piled on, like be does to you, he needs to leave lmao. \n\nCan\u2019t date 5 women and then not know boobs are different sized/shaped\u2026 smh", "You ended the mans whole career", "What it is to be young lol. Such a non issue. You\u2019re good op. Don\u2019t worry about it", "Ask him if his balls are the exact same size lol", "Don't start no shit, won't be no shit.

Don't dish it out if you can't take it Ronaldo.", "Tl;dr moment, holy fuck that essay.", "NTA, don't throw punches you can't take", "NTA he sounds like a bit of a tit", "I wanna see your drawing tho. Is it possible? Just asking", "NTA. He doubled down just because. If he had said \"oh I never knew that\" and you'd still continued to argue then you would have been a dick. Man refused to believe you and the women in class when they told him it's true. What kind of an idiot argues with a woman about their own body?", "NTA. insane that a full grown adult can\u2019t comprehend two different sized titties", "NTA\n\nHe fucked around and found out. Besides, there's this thing called perspective? From a certain perspective breasts can look like one is slightly bigger than the other.", "One of mine is a red delicious apple and the other is a navel orange.", "an Ornstein and a Smough", "Indeed.\n\nI was quite unlucky, I think. A while ago I had a tumour in one lung. Surgery and recovery were more difficult because it was pretty much directly under Biggie.\n\nArguably though that was bad luck on which side Biggie was, since if you're going to have a tumour in your lung right middle lobe is where you want it.\n\nThe surgery was useful, too. Ever since when I am referring my own patients to him I tell them, \"He's very good. When I needed thoracic surgery he was the surgeon I chose.\" They find that reassuring.", "Unaugmented are generally.", "LMAO", "Fucking gottem", "My left leg is like a centimeter or so longer than my right which is a weird thing to find out when you\u2019re at the doctors office trying to figure out why you have chronic pain.", "Internal organs too. I had an ultrasound for health issues and my right kidney is larger than my left.", "You can be right and be the AH if you take it too far, to me doesn\u2019t sound like he took it too far just that the other person had their ego hurt because they were wrong and wouldn\u2019t admit it. \n\nNTA", "Me or him? With me, I was kind of pressured into it at a younger age, but I\u2019m making it work exceptionally, and me and my fianc\u00e9e have bonded through trauma and shared interests, I don\u2019t know his situation tho", "I wasn\u2019t drawing naked women lol I was sketching a character who is fully clothed, but for the angle that the picture was sketched at, one of her boobs look bigger than the other lmao", "The thing is, we aren\u2019t friends, and I don\u2019t take being the butt end of the joke badly! I am deeply depressed, so I enjoy acting goofy to make people laugh, so a lot of the time, when I\u2019m the butt end of the joke, it\u2019s intentional. That day though, I just felt like it would be funny, since we were having a playful back and forth in which I was factually correct, for him to be at the end of the stick. We were bantering, neither of us really escalating, and out of no where he just shut down", "I don't rip at my friends because I can't take it, it hurts my feelings.", "Im female and rarely are boobs the same. One is usually slightly larger on the dominant hand side. I'm a lefty sooo. You're good. Most cant deal with a taste of their own medicine.", "These aren't your friends. NTA", "Why are you describing my testicles?", "In college, my pals and I went around the table deciding what fruit everyone resembled. They decided I had honeydew melons. Another friend had cantaloupes. Another grapefruit. One girl had raspberries. \n\nIt was all just for fun. We all respected each other and just laughed about it. I doubt any of us had perfectly matched fruit lol.", "I grew up with this kid from Brooklyn in the 80s. He was a rapper and called himself biggie but we all knew his name was Chris. Wonder what happend to that dude...", "When I was young right boob was always about half a cup size bigger. My kid didn\u2019t like drinking from my left boob, so I basically fed them 80% from the right Despite trying to even it out - she was adamant right boob was the ish. Right boob then got massive compared to left.

Nah I'll keep my asymmetrical tits.", "Mine were the same for about a month after surgery. Once they started to settle in they were different again.", "Is it because that\u2019s the side your heart is on?", "Lol is this really true? My left is significantly bigger, to the point I wear exclusively sports bras because I can never find a regular fit bra where the left one isn't spilling out when the right one fits perfect \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f I have a few friends who have mentioned in passing that their left is bigger too, but I never thought to see if this has been actually studied \ud83d\ude02", "My right is bigger. And I like to be unusual :)", "I don't know if that is true. But, it is true in my case.", "You notice how it was your male classmates calling you a dick? It's because the women all knew you were correct.\n\nI wouldn't necessarily have faulted him for not being consciously aware of it, because sometimes the difference in size may not be noticeable, but him doubling-down with \"a girl *can't* have two different-sized boobs\" was just asking for a verbal smackdown.", "Ignore those", "They have boobs on google??", "Sorry to break it to you but he\u2019s dead.

My right is a full cup size larger than the left. It wasn\u2019t as big of a difference before kids.  My left was also the \u201cparty boob\u201d when I was breastfeeding and the right was the slacker boob. I have no idea if that made any impact on how they changed after weaning.", "Freak!", "Oh also my left side produced more milk when I had a baby \ud83d\ude2c", "It is true, which is why I called it a fact", "More likely, they want OP to apologise to get him to just shut up.", "I was going to say the same, about how it's only the male classmates who think OP was in the wrong. Also, homie who didn't know female anatomy is probably most salty because multiple women corrected him (esp in front of other men). That's gotta be a huge ego blow.\n\nOP you are NTA", "\"Honey, why are you bringing calipers to bed?\"\"...Reasons\"", "Pizza lunch, jeans fridays, and a foosball table are surely enough?", "Not at all, OP needed to stand up for themselves and did.
