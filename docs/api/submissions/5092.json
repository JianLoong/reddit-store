Computers are kept locked up and only used when he is not around.  We also avoid fast food, processed food, etc.  I know how easy it is for a picky palate to become dependent on processed foods or specific foods like McDs.  So we never, ever eat them because I don\u2019t want to introduce it.  Our son is limited in what he eats.  He wiol eat almost any fruit. He will eat a salad, but it needs to have one kind of dressing.  He only eats meat cooked certain ways.  He will only eat steamed veggies.  And the foods have to be separate.  \n\nOur OT therapist and DT therapist have said the lack of exposure to screens and processed foods have probably helped because our son is so severe.  He does eat more than most kids and more variety and he will use toys more because he has no screens.  \n\nSo with all these rules and the fact that our son really struggles with being off routine, we don\u2019t try to go out much.

Guess what, you keep him sheltered he's gonna get overwhelmed when he's suddenly exposed to the world outside you. Everyone's autism is different but for me if I'm suddenly introduced to a thing and I like it then it's more likely I get fixated on it. I know several other people who are similar. If he wants a burger, try making him one. Talk to autistic adults for their advice. Especially autistic adults with autistic children. Expose him to things little by little. He's overwhelmed in public? Why? Did you ask him? If it's noise, try noise cancelling headphones. If it's anxiety then meds and therapy. Some things you can't change. For me, my sensory issues go nuts with smell and textures. Textures can be helped some ways but smells less so. That's fine. Doctors can be useful but a lot of them don't know anything about autism. Even if they do they know a hell of a lot less than autistic people. Talk to your son about what he needs. Talk to autistic people who might be able to offer advice. Don't be one of those moms that makes their kids autism their entire personality. You may be his parent, but he's the disabled one here. He's the one who has to live this life. Your job is to make it easier for him and do what he needs.", "NTA, at all.\n\nYour sister overstepped big time; you have every right to be angry and set harsh boundaries with her from now on.\n\nAlso, you sound like a great parent.

I'm talking about the type of moms who act like they're the ones who have to live as an autistic person. You said your son signed earlier so I assumed he could communicate pretty well that way. I can't speak either and people tend to not actually talk to me and just talk to other people as if they know what I want. I'm sorry for assuming that was the situation here. For me, the internet and screens in general have given me access to community I otherwise wouldn't have and games and shows to keep me calm and entertained. The fast food is less of a thing that matters but I don't really understand the point of keeping it away from him either. Another assumption I'm sorry for was assuming he doesn't go anywhere. Personally with my autism and other disabilities I'm pretty home bound which brings me back to the screens. Maybe he won't be able to access community but I think it's a bit too much to not allow him to watch TV or movies. Having a movie or show that is comforting can be a great help to autistic people. I'm just one autistic person on the internet and I don't know your full situation but I do stand by what I said. Honestly, I think you need to make more of an effort to communicate with him. He may have cognitive delay but he still feels. There are lots of situations where communicating your needs is as simple as one word. Smell, sound, feeling.

I can\u2019t have any more children for medical reasons completely unrelated to my son or his birth.  I\u2019d love to adopt.  But I\u2019m only 28.  So we\u2019re going to wait another 5-10 years to make sure that\u2019s the right decision.  Another option discussed was adopting another child with autism.", "I legit mean this nicely, because my kids are now older. I think it's a great theory to limit exposure to that stuff... but I'm not sure it works. I think it's 80% luck, at least. I've known too many kids with ASD or ARFID who would actually starve themselves and who were like this before they ever had exposure to fast food. I know you're probably not under the illusion that you have 100% control and that your view is about tilting the odds. But what I've learned is how much less control I actually have than I thought I would.  \n\nas kids get older you are going to have to make decisions about when to expose him to junk food or screena because you're not going to be able to avoid them forever. Your sister was wrong to take that decision out of your hands, and I'm not disagreeing there, but this day is going to come.", "Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to come across as rude or anything. Just that this particular environment would not be great for a neurotypical/high functioning neurodivergent child because they would likely grow up to eventually be independent and would not do well in a world that has devices banned for the sake of their older sibling. You have plenty of time to have more, but if you do then I hope that with age you would be able to lift some of the restrictions you have on your house for a future child when they get older. NTA in my book, you\u2019re doing why\u2019s best for your child now, and if it\u2019s been approved by doctors, then keep doing what you\u2019re doing right now.", "They don\u2019t help usually.  That\u2019s why it was so rare.  Usually we pay for professional respite care.  But that\u2019s expensive, so it\u2019s rare.", "People are skipping this so much. OP didn\u2019t decide on their own. They didn\u2019t even with one doctor and said that was it. They did a few and both primaries of their kid have said they\u2019re doing right. Why question anything else? Maybe a 3rd or 4th opinion just to be sure. But even then. Other than that I don\u2019t see the need to question any further really if two different types of specialist have confirmed already. They know they\u2019re doing right by asking and confirming with the doctors. They\u2019ve checked. I understand everyone has different cases and differences based on what is actually going through , but it seems OP has a firm grasp of their reality.  They\u2019re NTA at all in my book. I\u2019ve worked with children for over 8 years. Some as blood (babysitting  family/ family friends ect) some as genuine childcare ( daycare\u2019s as well as schools within multiple districts) and they all have set boundaries for certain kids is expected to be absolutely respected. If not fired immediately basically, if not respected. It shouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re family or not. It\u2019s what the parents allow on all regards, if it\u2019s not accepted by them they have to opt out or just simply state those restrictions when enrolling them. (6moths -14 yr olds I\u2019ve worked w btw if that matter.) OP knows at this point what is best. I hate to say bc they have been involved w this type of scenario before that might have inclined them to be even more aware of their current situation. That may be why they\u2019re being so careful now.", "OP, NTA (for now). I think you're right to listen to the medical professionals. And when you and your doctors think it's time, start introducing screens and the outside world to your kiddo.\n\nGood luck!", "Are they professionals who care about autistic people or are they professionals who promote things like ABA and Autism Speaks? Because if they\u2019re the second, they\u2019re harmful to your kid. Ask any autistic adult who personally experienced the abuse (like me, hi).", "No screens, having a flip phone instead of a smart phone, and eating healthy? Sounds like a great way to raise any kid.", "No, we don\u2019t do ABA.  He dies DT, OT, and has an SLP who does the sign with us.  They seem like decent therapists.  They were the ones who fought to do what was needed during Covid, so they are the ones we stick with.  Like his SLP was virtual and two signs got lost.  So she fought like hell to get a waiver to do therapy in person and we got the signs back and added more.  Similar styles with the other two.", "That\u2019s good! A lot of DT and OT who \u201cspecialize\u201d in autism also recommend ABA and similar practices, which are harmful and cause lasting problems in autistic adults. Since they seem to know what they\u2019re doing and actually want to help find what\u2019s best for your kiddo, I\u2019d say NTA. Keep following their advices.", "That makes sense, thank you for explaining! I guess I kind of zoomed in on other parts of the post and didn't really think about that too much", "No problem! This was a post that can hit close and personal for people in and adjacent to the community, so obviously emotions run pretty high lol"]}
