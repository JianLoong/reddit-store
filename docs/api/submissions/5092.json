Computers are kept locked up and only used when he is not around.  We also avoid fast food, processed food, etc.  I know how easy it is for a picky palate to become dependent on processed foods or specific foods like McDs.  So we never, ever eat them because I don\u2019t want to introduce it.  Our son is limited in what he eats.  He wiol eat almost any fruit. He will eat a salad, but it needs to have one kind of dressing.  He only eats meat cooked certain ways.  He will only eat steamed veggies.  And the foods have to be separate.  \n\nOur OT therapist and DT therapist have said the lack of exposure to screens and processed foods have probably helped because our son is so severe.  He does eat more than most kids and more variety and he will use toys more because he has no screens.  \n\nSo with all these rules and the fact that our son really struggles with being off routine, we don\u2019t try to go out much.

Guess what, you keep him sheltered he's gonna get overwhelmed when he's suddenly exposed to the world outside you. Everyone's autism is different but for me if I'm suddenly introduced to a thing and I like it then it's more likely I get fixated on it. I know several other people who are similar. If he wants a burger, try making him one. Talk to autistic adults for their advice. Especially autistic adults with autistic children. Expose him to things little by little. He's overwhelmed in public? Why? Did you ask him? If it's noise, try noise cancelling headphones. If it's anxiety then meds and therapy. Some things you can't change. For me, my sensory issues go nuts with smell and textures. Textures can be helped some ways but smells less so. That's fine. Doctors can be useful but a lot of them don't know anything about autism. Even if they do they know a hell of a lot less than autistic people. Talk to your son about what he needs. Talk to autistic people who might be able to offer advice. Don't be one of those moms that makes their kids autism their entire personality. You may be his parent, but he's the disabled one here. He's the one who has to live this life. Your job is to make it easier for him and do what he needs.", "NTA, at all.\n\nYour sister overstepped big time; you have every right to be angry and set harsh boundaries with her from now on.\n\nAlso, you sound like a great parent.

I'm talking about the type of moms who act like they're the ones who have to live as an autistic person. You said your son signed earlier so I assumed he could communicate pretty well that way. I can't speak either and people tend to not actually talk to me and just talk to other people as if they know what I want. I'm sorry for assuming that was the situation here. For me, the internet and screens in general have given me access to community I otherwise wouldn't have and games and shows to keep me calm and entertained. The fast food is less of a thing that matters but I don't really understand the point of keeping it away from him either. Another assumption I'm sorry for was assuming he doesn't go anywhere. Personally with my autism and other disabilities I'm pretty home bound which brings me back to the screens. Maybe he won't be able to access community but I think it's a bit too much to not allow him to watch TV or movies. Having a movie or show that is comforting can be a great help to autistic people. I'm just one autistic person on the internet and I don't know your full situation but I do stand by what I said. Honestly, I think you need to make more of an effort to communicate with him. He may have cognitive delay but he still feels. There are lots of situations where communicating your needs is as simple as one word. Smell, sound, feeling.

In the short term, McDonald's isnt a big deal; a one-time indulgence won't ruin his body. The issue here is that now OP's son may cause real harm to himself by refusing to eat.

Rotenberg center is infamous for shocking their autistic kids.", "The thing with ABA is that is it built on terrible foundations. It was designed under the assumption that autistic people were essentially just Things that had Behaviours that needed to be changed. The founders of ABA were very open about not believing autistic people to be humans, and they believed that autistic people had no real internal thought to speak of so no real attempt was ever made to consider *why* the person might be acting as they are, because autistic 'people' don't have reasons for doing things they are just deranged children that make other people's lives difficult with their incomprehensible behaviour. \n\nAs a result of this attitude, very little was off the table by means of positive or negative reinforcement (in the sense of positive being something done or given to the person, and negative being something taken away) including physical abuse and pain, withholding of basic necessities, psychological abuse, physical and chemical restraint, removal of existing coping mechanisms, withholding of affection and attention from family etc. \n\nIt isn't uncommon to hear of these practices still in use across the world, but even where ABA has been cleaned up to look nicer, even where bits have been tacked on which claim to consider the person's reasoning for acting as they do, even where there have been attempts to treat autistic people as human while doing ABA, it's still a modality founded on the belief that you can learn everything you need to know about an autistic person through their behaviour. \n\nIt is still a modality obsessed with data and tracking the behaviours of autistic people above all else, where success is measured primarily, if not only, by numerical calculations of how certain behaviours have changed, with the wellbeing of the autistic person always being secondary, if it is considered at all (by the structure of the therapy itself, obviously individual practitioners and family may prioritise the autistic person's wellbeing, but the 'treatment' itself doesn't naturally factor that in). \n\nMy personal stipulation would be; surely we can do better? After all these decades, surely we can design a way of helping high-support autistic people and their families that has the basic fact of their humanity and autonomy baked into it's underlying assumptions instead of sometimes added in as an afterthought? Surely we can create something that has a more flexible and creative understanding of what wellbeing and living well can look like for the people who need this support, and of how to get there, instead of arbitrarily adding painful stimuli (exposure to known sensory stressors, physical reprimands, restraints, harsh criticism and insults etc.) and removing things the person needs/wants (such as sensory aids, comfort items, access to special interest material, affection and comfort from caregivers, any and all social contact by placing them in isolation etc.).", "[deleted]", "Jesus, I had no idea. I appreciate your explanation. When I was fresh out of undergrad I interviewed at a place that does ABA (this was when I was 22, over a decade ago, and my aunt had a friend there and got me an interview, I didn't know anything about it other than that they would train me in it). They had me sit in on a session and that's pretty much all I've seen of it, which was pretty much just fruit loops for eye contact, which is where I got the dog training impression. I mean a few years later I did literally the same exercise with my dogs. \n\nThe people I interviewed with were odd. They made it seem like working with autistic kids was a really terribly difficult thing and kept asking if I was sure I was up for it. After watching the session I didn't think it looked like the horrible experience they'd made it out to be, and I said so. They took that the wrong way and got really offended, as if *I'd* been the one saying it was so bad the whole time. The interview ended on a bad/weird note, but in hindsight I'm glad I didn't get that job. It would've set my career on a totally different trajectory.

Even for neurotypical folks, they can really struggle to stay off their phones. I've worked with some autistic kids who are glued to their phones from the time they wake up until the time they go to sleep, not constantly checking it and doing other stuff, but just in front of them at all times like the rest of the world doesn't exist. It's not great, especially when they got phones or tablets as assistive devices, sometimes on a very bad recommendation from a health care provider or counselor who didn't specialize in working with kids or autism.", "If the doctors would think that the way op is parenting their son is setting him up for failure in the future they would have said something", "This is what scares me. I got a job working with a wonderful little boy who is autistic. I basically just an assistant, but they\u2019ve had people come out to observe him and I think they\u2019re going to do the ABA therapy which worries me, but I don\u2019t know if I should say anything to his mother or not.", "FYI \u201chigh support needs\u201d is still perfectly appropriate language. It\u2019s a neutral/non-judgmental way of describing what the autistic person deals with in day-to-day life, instead of putting the focus on their caregivers or other neurotypical people they interact with.", "It's all about routine creating what you think safe food is. If you feed Mc to a two year old, of course they'll decide its the best food in the world. But wait a few years before introducing it, and suddenly KFC is too spicy (me) or Pepsi is too sweet and bubbly (my sis).", "This is so sad. For us, things fell apart screen wise during the pandemic. The kids weren't doing social media, but suddenly they just had so much device time, not least of which was for school. It's infested our family and I am struggling to get rid of it.", "u/sidebackground6932\n\nPlease consider using AAC for communication in addition to signing. There is a big difference in fine motor skills needed to tap a screen on a tablet vs using one or two hands to make a sign. Courtney of Just Keep Stimming on Instagram is a non-speaking AAC user who has written extensively about different AAC programs. I will link her page below. \n\nI understand how vilified screens are, but for autistics like myself, they are one of the main ways I learn and socialize. Watching educational videos helps me learn better than simply reading about them. There are many benefits to screens, especially for neurodivergent people. \n\nhttps://instagram.com/justkeepstimming", "I don\u2019t want you to lose your job but I cannot let people stand by and let atrocities keep occurring and hurting us.

People have claimed restraints, deprivation, and tasers. These would get you disbarred in a minute.", "You're completely right! You beat me to this response \n\nBut just to add, people also took issue with \"functioning\" as it sounded more permanent, whereas needs can change. I might start off low support needs but that might change as I get older, or vary depending on my day, surroundings, how well I've slept and a bunch of other factors. \n\nThere's a really good book by Dr Luke Beardon where he says \"autism + environment = outcome\" and that sums it up. If the environment changes, the outcome changes.\n\nWhich is why OPs sister messed up so badly, she changed the environment which led to a new outcome, which has a) changed routine, b) brought in an outside stimulus that didn't need to be there and c) undermined OPs authority as a parent (which is just plain disrespectful)\n\nSure, movies and screens and fast food sounds great, but as someone who wasn't exposed to a lot of unprocessed foods I struggle a lot with eating any fruit (I can handle apples, but the rest make me feel or be sick), and I hate the taste and texture of unprocessed meats, focussing on getting the kid used to those in a safe environment, and making healthy food routine is far better for that kid's development than an untampered desire to be the \"fun aunt\" for the night. I still struggle with food and I wish I'd been taught the fundamentals of eating healthy much sooner - might have avoided an eating disorder if I had.\n\nIt sounds like op has found healthy ways to feed the kid without it causing sensory issues. Keep doing what you're doing OP, and good luck!", "Sorry yes, I should have been more clear, it's a low functioning language that's super out of date and ableist, but unfortunately the only thing a lot of people are still familiar with.", "Thank you for clarifying this! That\u2019s very helpful", "per OP's response (10hrs ago) when asked about AAC:  \n\n\n>We\u2019ve tried yes and no buttons. He didn\u2019t like the voice when we hit them and wouldn\u2019t use them. We tried buttons where we could record our voice. Wouldn\u2019t use them. We tried picture boards. Won\u2019t use them. We tried a white board. Pencils and paper. He can\u2019t write that we know if, but we thought he might draw. Won\u2019t engage.

At all. \n\nRestraints of any kind are absolutely banned.", "To you point, there was a child who was recently murdered using these restraints! It is so dangerous and damaging", "So am I. \nAnd I have training in Applied Behavior Analysis. Nothing to do with it has to do with \u201ccuring a child\u201d \n\nY\u2019all are calling practices that are obviously bad and malpractice something that it\u2019s not.\n\nI can send you an example of what actual evidence based ABA is. It\u2019s about supporting a client whose behavior is inappropriate for a setting and helping them find another behavior that serves the same function. Such as a 1st grade child I worked with who went overstimulated would get aggressive and hit other children in their vicinity. We helped them find a behavior (asking an adult for a break and immediately getting said break) which served the same function. \n\nIf someone who says that they practice ABA therapy advocates for replacing someone\u2019s stimming, eye contact or other behaviors that do not endanger them they are incredibly misinformed in modern therapy and shouldn\u2019t be practicing", "They've partnered with the Judge Rotenberg Center and literally only released a statement expressing disapproval of it in 2022. \n\nI am not lying. \n\nProof of partnering with JRC in conferences: https://www.abainternational.org/events/annual-2022.aspx\n\nProof that it only just expressed disapproval: https://autisticadvocacy.org/2022/11/abai-finally-opposes-the-use-of-electric-shocks-at-the-jrc/\n\nProof that dog trainers have expressed that ABA offers less respect for the needs of Autistic people than dog trainers do for dogs: https://neuroclastic.com/is-aba-really-dog-training-for-children-a-professional-dog-trainer-weighs-in/\n\nProof the UN has called what the JRC does torture: https://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/shock-therapy-massachussetts-school/story?id=11047334\n\nThe JRC used BCBAs and members of the ABAI. If ABAI wanted to they could enact professional sanctions against those who work there. They do not.\n\nLastly, the ABAI has a code of conduct for members and could choose to include a prohibition on physical aversives and torture. They do not, instead passing the buck to other organizations, which themselves also do not tend to prohibit such conduct.", "Lol. Apparently me helping a child in crisis (when overstimulated they would act aggressively and hit other children) by supporting them in identifying an alternative behavior (requesting a break from an adult and then receiving that break) is abusive.\n\nABA is a broad field. It\u2019s incredibly uncharitable to describe an entire field based on anecdotal evidence. \n\nSure, the field needs reformed to stop practices like the JRC engages in, or that try to force a child to stop stimming or to make them engage in \u201csocially acceptable\u201d behaviors like eye contact. \n\nBut ABA is much bigger picture than you think. I encourage you to calm down and realize that just as other systems in the world can involve oppression it doesn\u2019t mean every individual working in them is complicit. \n\nWorking from within to reform practices is a way to enact change.", "\"I can't even call you human\". That right there is the extreme that makes people stop taking you seriously. You sound completely unhinged. My daughter's ABA in it's entirety consisted of redirecting her to eat soft peppermint instead of crayons. That's it. So that's abuse in your mind? Good thing you're not in charge of anything then, she'd be still eating entire cartons of crayons and vomiting uncontrollably if it were up to you I guess. Great job on being a living stereotype.", "Maybe listen to actual autistic people and what we tell you", "I should also note the BCAB's code of ethics doesn't mention physical contact or aversives at all let alone attempt to regulate them. As the ABAI refers to the BCAB for it's ethics, one can reasonably infer they defer to the BCAB on such matters.\n\nThe BCAB doesn't call it an ethical violation to use physical aversives. \n\nSo, no, I am not lying when I say ABAI doesn't prohibit it. Even though they could if they wanted to.", "That\u2019s fair. There is controversy and unethical practices occurring in the ABA community at large. However a minority of unethical practices also exist in other fields as well. \n\nABA is a broader field that is cannot be compared equivocally to what the JRC does. My field (School Psychology) has ABA principles but nothing we do has anything to do with some of the \u201cfoundations of ABA\u201d that those articles describe. I\u2019m arguing that\u2019s in unfair and uncharitable to call an entire field \u201cconversion therapy\u201d when it could not be further from the truth. \n\nOur main goal isn\u2019t to get the child to be \u201cindistinguishable\u201d from their peers. We apply the theories to help them access their environment when behaviors are disruptive or harmful. Such as when I recently helped develop a behavior support plan for a 1st grade child who went overstimulated would hit or kick their classmates. We didn\u2019t apply shock treatment or aversives. We identified an alternative behavior (requesting a break from an adult and then receiving that break) for when they are overstimulated. Yes, we use positive reinforcement (praise, preferred activities or tangible rewards) to help motivate and increase the behavior but that\u2019s not \u201cdog training\u201d that\u2019s how we as humans learn to do things. We get rewards (intrinsic and extrinsic) for doing almost everything in our lives. The only unethical thing would be using punishment based strategies to shape behavior (like taking a child\u2019s free time/recess for engaging in the inappropriate behavior)", "person's willingly participating in an abusive system. abusive people are not human. my assessment is still correct. and you're abusive for putting your daughter in ABA. just letting you know. have a good day knowing your daughter is being traumatized by \"therapy\" you have her in. it may appear that it works but im telling you, it does not. and i have personal experience here."]}
