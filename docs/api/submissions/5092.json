Computers are kept locked up and only used when he is not around.  We also avoid fast food, processed food, etc.  I know how easy it is for a picky palate to become dependent on processed foods or specific foods like McDs.  So we never, ever eat them because I don\u2019t want to introduce it.  Our son is limited in what he eats.  He wiol eat almost any fruit. He will eat a salad, but it needs to have one kind of dressing.  He only eats meat cooked certain ways.  He will only eat steamed veggies.  And the foods have to be separate.  \n\nOur OT therapist and DT therapist have said the lack of exposure to screens and processed foods have probably helped because our son is so severe.  He does eat more than most kids and more variety and he will use toys more because he has no screens.  \n\nSo with all these rules and the fact that our son really struggles with being off routine, we don\u2019t try to go out much.

Guess what, you keep him sheltered he's gonna get overwhelmed when he's suddenly exposed to the world outside you. Everyone's autism is different but for me if I'm suddenly introduced to a thing and I like it then it's more likely I get fixated on it. I know several other people who are similar. If he wants a burger, try making him one. Talk to autistic adults for their advice. Especially autistic adults with autistic children. Expose him to things little by little. He's overwhelmed in public? Why? Did you ask him? If it's noise, try noise cancelling headphones. If it's anxiety then meds and therapy. Some things you can't change. For me, my sensory issues go nuts with smell and textures. Textures can be helped some ways but smells less so. That's fine. Doctors can be useful but a lot of them don't know anything about autism. Even if they do they know a hell of a lot less than autistic people. Talk to your son about what he needs. Talk to autistic people who might be able to offer advice. Don't be one of those moms that makes their kids autism their entire personality. You may be his parent, but he's the disabled one here. He's the one who has to live this life. Your job is to make it easier for him and do what he needs.", "NTA, at all.\n\nYour sister overstepped big time; you have every right to be angry and set harsh boundaries with her from now on.\n\nAlso, you sound like a great parent.

I'm talking about the type of moms who act like they're the ones who have to live as an autistic person. You said your son signed earlier so I assumed he could communicate pretty well that way. I can't speak either and people tend to not actually talk to me and just talk to other people as if they know what I want. I'm sorry for assuming that was the situation here. For me, the internet and screens in general have given me access to community I otherwise wouldn't have and games and shows to keep me calm and entertained. The fast food is less of a thing that matters but I don't really understand the point of keeping it away from him either. Another assumption I'm sorry for was assuming he doesn't go anywhere. Personally with my autism and other disabilities I'm pretty home bound which brings me back to the screens. Maybe he won't be able to access community but I think it's a bit too much to not allow him to watch TV or movies. Having a movie or show that is comforting can be a great help to autistic people. I'm just one autistic person on the internet and I don't know your full situation but I do stand by what I said. Honestly, I think you need to make more of an effort to communicate with him. He may have cognitive delay but he still feels. There are lots of situations where communicating your needs is as simple as one word. Smell, sound, feeling.

I think it's a great theory to limit exposure to that stuff... but I'm not sure it works. I think it's 80% luck, at least.

I know you're probably not under the illusion that you have 100% control and that your view is about tilting the odds. But what I've learned is how much less control I actually have than I thought I would.  \n\nas kids get older you are going to have to make decisions about when to expose him to junk food or screena because you're not going to be able to avoid them forever.

You have plenty of time to have more, but if you do then I hope that with age you would be able to lift some of the restrictions you have on your house for a future child when they get older.

They didn\u2019t even with one doctor and said that was it. They did a few and both primaries of their kid have said they\u2019re doing right. Why question anything else? Maybe a 3rd or 4th opinion just to be sure. But even then. Other than that I don\u2019t see the need to question any further really if two different types of specialist have confirmed already. They know they\u2019re doing right by asking and confirming with the doctors. They\u2019ve checked. I understand everyone has different cases and differences based on what is actually going through , but it seems OP has a firm grasp of their reality.  They\u2019re NTA at all in my book. I\u2019ve worked with children for over 8 years. Some as blood (babysitting  family/ family friends ect) some as genuine childcare ( daycare\u2019s as well as schools within multiple districts) and they all have set boundaries for certain kids is expected to be absolutely respected. If not fired immediately basically, if not respected. It shouldn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re family or not. It\u2019s what the parents allow on all regards, if it\u2019s not accepted by them they have to opt out or just simply state those restrictions when enrolling them.

That may be why they\u2019re being so careful now.", "OP, NTA (for now). I think you're right to listen to the medical professionals.

She'll eat steamed broccoli or saut\u00e9ed arugala any day of the week, baked potatoes, blueberries, strawberries, bananas, certain apples, grapes, a wide variery of lettuces, onion, cucumbers in pickle juice (but not pickles!), most cheeses, wheat bread, tortillas, brown rice, sour cream, plain avocado or guacamole if I make it, scrambled eggs, pasta with one specific jar sauce or sauce I've made, one specific brand and flavor of Greek yogurt, most waffles or pancakes, one brand of peanut butter and a specific low sugar strawberry jelly (low, not non-sugar, I try to avoid artificial sweeteners), raisin bran, cheerios, unsweetened almond milk in her cereal, the occasional sip of oj, water...and vegetarian fast food and most sweets. She didn't have any fast food or processed sugar until she was 5 and her list was much shorter then. I think if she'd had access to those things earlier she'd have a more limited list of what she will eat now. \n\nIt is always a struggle to get her back to eating normally after she vacations with my parents and niblings. My parents default to fast food or very simple, repetitive, not particularly healthy food that everyone else will also eat.

The screens can be a great tool for encouraging learning and growth, but they can also be a huge hindrance to a lot of types of development. I think it\u2019s better to approach adding screens later on rather than allow early dependence (honestly, I agree with this for all kids, but with ASD you have to be a lot more \u201call or nothing\u201d or you\u2019re just inviting chaos and meltdowns).", "Massive NTA\n\nI have a son on the spectrum and if my sister did this she would be NC too.

Especially if it\u2019s adding something else to his menu. \n\nWatching a screen. Of course he was mesmerized by your sisters phone. If you\u2019ve managed to keep all screens hidden for 5 years, while impressive, it also means his little mind was completely overwhelmed by a screen. \n\nWhich is an unintended consequence of hiding screens completely. Because the thing is, him not ever seeing something on TV was not going to be possible. It\u2019s just not. \n\nBe militant but have some flexibility. For example, no phones or tablets but maybe 30 minutes a day.
