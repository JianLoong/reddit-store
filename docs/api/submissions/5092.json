Computers are kept locked up and only used when he is not around.  We also avoid fast food, processed food, etc.  I know how easy it is for a picky palate to become dependent on processed foods or specific foods like McDs.  So we never, ever eat them because I don\u2019t want to introduce it.  Our son is limited in what he eats.  He wiol eat almost any fruit. He will eat a salad, but it needs to have one kind of dressing.  He only eats meat cooked certain ways.  He will only eat steamed veggies.  And the foods have to be separate.  \n\nOur OT therapist and DT therapist have said the lack of exposure to screens and processed foods have probably helped because our son is so severe.  He does eat more than most kids and more variety and he will use toys more because he has no screens.  \n\nSo with all these rules and the fact that our son really struggles with being off routine, we don\u2019t try to go out much.

Guess what, you keep him sheltered he's gonna get overwhelmed when he's suddenly exposed to the world outside you. Everyone's autism is different but for me if I'm suddenly introduced to a thing and I like it then it's more likely I get fixated on it. I know several other people who are similar. If he wants a burger, try making him one. Talk to autistic adults for their advice. Especially autistic adults with autistic children. Expose him to things little by little. He's overwhelmed in public? Why? Did you ask him? If it's noise, try noise cancelling headphones. If it's anxiety then meds and therapy. Some things you can't change. For me, my sensory issues go nuts with smell and textures. Textures can be helped some ways but smells less so. That's fine. Doctors can be useful but a lot of them don't know anything about autism. Even if they do they know a hell of a lot less than autistic people. Talk to your son about what he needs. Talk to autistic people who might be able to offer advice. Don't be one of those moms that makes their kids autism their entire personality. You may be his parent, but he's the disabled one here. He's the one who has to live this life. Your job is to make it easier for him and do what he needs.", "NTA, at all.\n\nYour sister overstepped big time; you have every right to be angry and set harsh boundaries with her from now on.\n\nAlso, you sound like a great parent.

I'm talking about the type of moms who act like they're the ones who have to live as an autistic person. You said your son signed earlier so I assumed he could communicate pretty well that way. I can't speak either and people tend to not actually talk to me and just talk to other people as if they know what I want. I'm sorry for assuming that was the situation here. For me, the internet and screens in general have given me access to community I otherwise wouldn't have and games and shows to keep me calm and entertained. The fast food is less of a thing that matters but I don't really understand the point of keeping it away from him either. Another assumption I'm sorry for was assuming he doesn't go anywhere. Personally with my autism and other disabilities I'm pretty home bound which brings me back to the screens. Maybe he won't be able to access community but I think it's a bit too much to not allow him to watch TV or movies. Having a movie or show that is comforting can be a great help to autistic people. I'm just one autistic person on the internet and I don't know your full situation but I do stand by what I said. Honestly, I think you need to make more of an effort to communicate with him. He may have cognitive delay but he still feels. There are lots of situations where communicating your needs is as simple as one word. Smell, sound, feeling.

In the short term, McDonald's isnt a big deal; a one-time indulgence won't ruin his body. The issue here is that now OP's son may cause real harm to himself by refusing to eat.

Rotenberg center is infamous for shocking their autistic kids.", "The thing with ABA is that is it built on terrible foundations. It was designed under the assumption that autistic people were essentially just Things that had Behaviours that needed to be changed. The founders of ABA were very open about not believing autistic people to be humans, and they believed that autistic people had no real internal thought to speak of so no real attempt was ever made to consider *why* the person might be acting as they are, because autistic 'people' don't have reasons for doing things they are just deranged children that make other people's lives difficult with their incomprehensible behaviour. \n\nAs a result of this attitude, very little was off the table by means of positive or negative reinforcement (in the sense of positive being something done or given to the person, and negative being something taken away) including physical abuse and pain, withholding of basic necessities, psychological abuse, physical and chemical restraint, removal of existing coping mechanisms, withholding of affection and attention from family etc. \n\nIt isn't uncommon to hear of these practices still in use across the world, but even where ABA has been cleaned up to look nicer, even where bits have been tacked on which claim to consider the person's reasoning for acting as they do, even where there have been attempts to treat autistic people as human while doing ABA, it's still a modality founded on the belief that you can learn everything you need to know about an autistic person through their behaviour. \n\nIt is still a modality obsessed with data and tracking the behaviours of autistic people above all else, where success is measured primarily, if not only, by numerical calculations of how certain behaviours have changed, with the wellbeing of the autistic person always being secondary, if it is considered at all (by the structure of the therapy itself, obviously individual practitioners and family may prioritise the autistic person's wellbeing, but the 'treatment' itself doesn't naturally factor that in). \n\nMy personal stipulation would be; surely we can do better? After all these decades, surely we can design a way of helping high-support autistic people and their families that has the basic fact of their humanity and autonomy baked into it's underlying assumptions instead of sometimes added in as an afterthought? Surely we can create something that has a more flexible and creative understanding of what wellbeing and living well can look like for the people who need this support, and of how to get there, instead of arbitrarily adding painful stimuli (exposure to known sensory stressors, physical reprimands, restraints, harsh criticism and insults etc.) and removing things the person needs/wants (such as sensory aids, comfort items, access to special interest material, affection and comfort from caregivers, any and all social contact by placing them in isolation etc.).", "[deleted]", "Jesus, I had no idea. I appreciate your explanation. When I was fresh out of undergrad I interviewed at a place that does ABA (this was when I was 22, over a decade ago, and my aunt had a friend there and got me an interview, I didn't know anything about it other than that they would train me in it). They had me sit in on a session and that's pretty much all I've seen of it, which was pretty much just fruit loops for eye contact, which is where I got the dog training impression. I mean a few years later I did literally the same exercise with my dogs. \n\nThe people I interviewed with were odd. They made it seem like working with autistic kids was a really terribly difficult thing and kept asking if I was sure I was up for it. After watching the session I didn't think it looked like the horrible experience they'd made it out to be, and I said so. They took that the wrong way and got really offended, as if *I'd* been the one saying it was so bad the whole time. The interview ended on a bad/weird note, but in hindsight I'm glad I didn't get that job. It would've set my career on a totally different trajectory.

This is because screen time is shown to mess with early development, so you wait until they have finished that early development to introduce independent screen time to them. And fast food is so addictive that you should be getting them used to eating a variety of healthy foods as well as developing regulation skills before you\u2019re introducing that to them.

ABA is a very broad term that can include what this person is talking about but also many other things. They are taking a very limited experience which is admittedly upsetting, and just applying it to an entire field with no real knowledge of the larger field.\n\nABA means \"Applied Behavior Analysis\". It basically means analyzing behavior to understand why something is happening and what it's goal is, and approaching it form that outlook. Let me give you an example of \"ABA\" I used with my own neurotypical child.\n\nSo, there's a concept in ABA called \"the ABCs of Behavior\" which is Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence. If a child is engaging in a behavior that problematic for some reason, you look at the antecedent (what comes before/triggers it), the behavior, and the consequence (what happens after). The idea is that if the child keeps doing something they presumably have a reason, and on some level it's doing what they want, meeting some need, etc. So it's \"reinforcing\" them. \n\nSo when my younger daughter was one she started intentionally whacking her head on the floor (this was not so subtle, being one. She's look right at me first to make sure I was nearby to see), then cry and hold out to be to be picked up and hugged. So looking at it I realized it would happen times when I wasn't holding her/doing something. She'd want a hug, she knew she always got picked up and hugged when she was hurt, so she would hurt herself to get the result of being picked up and hugged. This was a problem beacuse I didn't want her to hurt herself. So, I taught her a \"replacement behavior\" that would give her the same reinforcement appropriately. In this case that was saying/asking for a \"mama hug\". At times she seemed to want a hug/attention, or when she did the head whack and cry, I'd prompt her (the technical term) to ask for a mama hug. \"Oh honey, do you want a hug? Say hug\". Then, as soon as she said hug I'd pick her up and give her love and cuddles.\n\nSoon, she stopped whacking her head on the floor and just used the word hug to ask for hugs. (Though she cutely learned to say \"mama hug\" when all I tried to teach her was hug.)\n\nThis is ABA. And it's what I do at work, too. But with older kids you can talk to them about it more in depth then a one year old. I am currently working with a kid who runs out of class due to past trauma. The issue is we need to know where they are and that they are safe. So we are not only working on antecedents (things that lead them to feel a need to escape) but also working on them asking to take a break to calm down, for them to have a place to go to calm down, coping skills, etc. And that's a conversation we are having with them. \n\nI can explain more about PECS later, I worked briefly in a classroom that did that. But saying that ABA is \"conversion therapy\" and \"the same abusive break you down and make you ashamed to be alive tactics\" is an ignorant generalization. Beacuse ABA is so broad and just means analyzing behavior to understand and address behavior, it covers many different approaches. Some may well be problematic, especially older methods from the past. There are also complicated questions like what behaviors do we deem problematic and try to get someone to change? So if you are discouraging harmless behaviors just beacuse they are weird, that could arguably be wrong and what OP is talking about. But ABA could also be teaching a kid to bite a chewy and not their peers, and I think we all agree that's preferable?", "Lots of actually autistic people today, including academics, say it is damaging. Reading should include their accounts, including peer-reviewed articles that show there isn't a significant improvement for children who have undergone ABA.

It also builds skills like self care, self-regulation, and recognizing and communicating needs. Lots of folks assume all autistic folks are just odd and low support. Many need significant intervention to live safely and get their needs met. Also, basically all kids learn by positive reinforcement.

It doesn't widen her palette, it makes her gag, often to the point of vomiting.

Masking is a strategy lots of people adopt for various reasons, but without being mindful of and dealing with underlying issues, it just teaches people that they won't be accepted as they are. ABA's long term 'dependence' is potentially a learned response that the person's other strategies to getting their needs met or expressing themselves will be rejected. I say all this as someone who has been trained in ABA and PBS, and rejected them because they felt wrong to me, and because I wanted to listen to the community I work for and ensure they be heard.

Even if based in applied behavioral analysis as a field, any program not doing this *calls itself something else in order to differentiate itself from the long history of abuse in ABA.\n\nMultiple hundreds if not thousands of autistic people have said that ABA *therapy* is harmful. Have provided testimonials and submitted scientific evidence. Some in this very thread. \n\nI get that you're trying to say \"I'm not ableist because I'm not doing the parts that are harmful\". Maybe even no one at your practice is, if you're lucky. Though in my experience as an autistic person, and especially with patient confidentiality laws, it's entirely possible others at your practice are doing more typical ABA.

But the truth is much closer to that modern ABA is like asylums and actually helpful therapy is like modern psychiatric care. \n\nI have seen testimonials from autistic parents of young autistic *kids* who took their kids in for ABA without fully understanding what it was and pulled them out after just one session because the therapist suggested trying to stop harmless forms of self-regulation. Something which, by the way, is a recommendation in ABA therapy for autistics, not something which someone can even be reported, let alone disbarred, for.\n\nStop trying to defend it over semantics.

No one here is talking about the redirection of harmful behaviors, which when done in a healthy way would fall closer to DBT or CBT, depending on the methodology used.\n\nYou are not the voice of the queer autistic community. Multiple, \"multiple* queer autistic people have compared it to conversion therapy, and you don't get to decide for them that it's not the same.

I'm autistic and my safe food changes all of the time and it's DEFINITELY not the same thing it was when I was a kid. This month it's country pork ribs with korean BBQ sauce, last month it was pumpkin turkey chili. In fact I don't eat ANYTHING my parents fed me as a kid anymore. A lot of times when kids realize their parents have been withholding from them they go hog wild on the things they've been missing out on. \n\nI was the reverse. My parents fed me JUNK because I was so picky and they didn't want to deal with it. As an adult I started to learn how to make food my sensory issues could handle that wasn't just Kraft Mac & Cheese and frozen nuggets. Adversely I know kids whose parents withheld things like poptarts etc and now they eat terribly because they never learned how to eat those things in moderation, so once they tasted that sweet sweet goodness they wanted it all the time. \n\nIt's honestly much better for parents to teach their kids healthy habits around all types of food. I have two kids and one is already diagnosed and we suspect the youngest will be too. We allow them to eat everything, but we try to teach moderation, same with tablets. Like you said, autistics like routine so if kids know what to expect they can definitely handle tablets and sweets if the parents are willing to hold them line and say no and suffer through a few tantrums to get to the other side. At this point I can give my kids a tablet and take it away and they cry for MAYBE a minute and then get over it.", "Of course i simplified it. It's a short Reddit comment., I'm not going to write a Master thesis here. I referred to the childhood food practices, of course adults who can reason with themselves and have to make their food, will have entirely different relationship with food than a child would. \n\nYes, all of us change. What do you want me to say?\n\nAnd if food you ate was that bad then probably it wasn't a safe food. Just safer than the alternative. It didn't provide you comfort, just lack of a meltdown. Fast food is usually an easy choice because it doesn't change taste and texture like veggies do. Find me one person that doesn't consider fast food or cereal or mac and cheese or butter on toast an easy meal to consume. That's the baseline. But you can always widen your palette to find tastier meals which are still easy and predictable texture, smell and taste-wise.\n\n If you let your kid eat fast food until they're four, they won't be happy when you decide they have to be \"healthy\" now. Especially since basically all childhood is developmentally difficult time.", "Firstly, you\u2019re correct about the severe autism comment; my apologies, I misread the original post.\n\nIf you listen to autistic people all across the spectrum (those who are fully independent, those who require full-time care, and those in between), you\u2019ll find that every autistic person needs different levels of care and support in different areas of their life. \n\nFor example, one autistic person might be highly capable in learning and researching their special interests and have a great deal of knowledge in that field, but struggles with verbal communication and emotional regulation; another might be highly verbal and sociable, but can\u2019t stand it when their routine is changed or their clothes rub against their skin a certain way. \n\nCondensing these variety of needs down to \u201cintellectual impairment\u201d removes the nuance- the reason that it isn\u2019t simply autism, but the autism spectrum. \n\nPlenty of autistic people can learn to navigate computers at varying degrees of complexity, from AAC boards to full laptops, and allowing them access (in a regulated fashion, discussed with therapists- OP is right to keep them from their five year old) can give them a way to connect if they simply struggle with verbalizing thoughts.\n\nI also don\u2019t see why you need to bring self-diagnosis into this, but since you did, sure, there are some people who self-diagnose with autism and ADHD without having those conditions. \n\nThere are also a lot of people who do have autism or disorders on the autism spectrum (like Aspberger\u2019s) whose parents might not have had the money/resources/know-how to take them to a doctor for a diagnosis in childhood. \n\nThat doesn\u2019t make them not autistic, it just means that instead of having a team of therapists to help them and their parents through navigating their situation, they had to fight their way through mainstream schooling without the accommodations that could have helped them. \n\nThe spectrum for what qualifies someone to fit under the classification of autistic is very broad; not all cases of autism involve severe impairment and every case presents differently. \n\nWhile non-autistic people self-diagnosing with autism misrepresents the condition, I also think treating less-impaired autistic people as \u201cnot autistic\u201d and focusing solely on those who need full-time care is also a misrepresentation, and does a disservice to autistic people who are capable of living independently but need societal supports that they \u201caren\u2019t disabled enough\u201d to access.", "Everything you said was right on the dot.

My sister is slightly younger than me but by the time she got to High School, iPhones and instagram accounts in Year 7 were a given.\n\nI just remember all the self confidence issues I had in Year 7 and can't imagine how much worse that would have been if I had been posting images of myself on Instagram. I would have probably cried if I got bullied or nobody liked it.", "Your comments just show such a fundamental lack of understanding about safe foods. The food I ate was bad as in nutritional value, but it was still  a safe food to me. A safe food is one that will not gross you out. It's not even about comfort (although sometimes they are comforting).\n\nI just don't understand why folks think kids pick a safe food at 5 and stick with it for life just because their parents made some decision to only feed them X. That just isn't how autism works. Our parents can't program us to be a certain way as children. \n\nAlso, it's SOOOOO misguided to think that this kid won't want junk when they are a teenager, and that was my point. If you withhold something from a kid, that only makes them want it more. This is true to allistic and autistic kids. I guarantee this kid will want McDonalds when they are a teen, and mom won't be able to keep it away forever, either. I'm not saying I disagree with her doing it now and choosing when to introduce it, but your logic that he won't want these things later because he didn't have them now is just the opposite of how kids actually work.", "I'm relieved to see this comment!

I didn't say that you program children. But if you provide an unhealthy \"safe\" food they might become dependent on it, so it's better to introduce healthy habits first, before going the \"fast-food is easy and prevents meltdowns route\" everyday. I didn't say you have to forbid your teenager from ever eating a burger, idk where you get that from. I'M TALKING ABOUT SMALL CHILDREN Forming a good relationship with food when a child is small impacts their whole life. That's why drinking age exists. You shouldn't consume a highly addictive substance, before your brain is developed enough to understand its not healthy to consume it everyday and manage it accordingly. And sugar is in fact more addictive than alcohol is. And people with autism are even more likely to stick to that addiction, since its not only chemical and  habitual addiction, but it's also their routine they need to stick with.", "Behaviorism is problematic as a sole theoretical orientation. However as a part of a larger theoretical framework it can help shed light on specifics to guide treatment. \n\nABA isn\u2019t something psychologists practice, it informs our work.

I'm here to tell you you're wrong. My parents never gave me alcohol as a kid, but boy I sure drank a ton of it in college once I could get my hands on it. \n\nIf you teach kids MODERATION around things like fast food and sugar you can teach healthy habits from a young age. Withholding things from kids rarely works out, but what would I, an autistic parent, who worked with kids for ten years before I had them, know about child psychology? \n\nParents always think MORE control is the answer instead of more guidance and education, and I'm here to tell you more control just leads to more rebellion when you can't keep hold of that control anymore. It's actually dangerous and can even lead to disordered eating behaviors.", "Yeah, the son was exposed to food that doesn't hurt to eat, and now that he knows that's an option, he hates eating normal food so much he'd rather starve.
