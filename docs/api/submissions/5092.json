We knew pretty early on he had signs that pointed to autism even as a baby (lack of eye contact, lack of verbal, etc.).  He was officially diagnosed at 2.\n\nI have a brother with autism.  He is non-verbal.  He is obsessed with screens and an incredibly picky eater.  Like, he was living off PB sandwiches and Oreos only for a couple years.  It\u2019s a bit better.  But not much.  He literally has a screen with him 24/7.  \n\nWhen I suspected autism in our son we ditched all screens.  We have no TV, no tablets, no smartphones.  I literally have a flip phone.  Computers are kept locked up and only used when he is not around.  We also avoid fast food, processed food, etc.  I know how easy it is for a picky palate to become dependent on processed foods or specific foods like McDs.  So we never, ever eat them because I don\u2019t want to introduce it.  Our son is limited in what he eats.  He wiol eat almost any fruit. He will eat a salad, but it needs to have one kind of dressing.  He only eats meat cooked certain ways.  He will only eat steamed veggies.  And the foods have to be separate.  \n\nOur OT therapist and DT therapist have said the lack of exposure to screens and processed foods have probably helped because our son is so severe.  He does eat more than most kids and more variety and he will use toys more because he has no screens.  \n\nSo with all these rules and the fact that our son really struggles with being off routine, we don\u2019t try to go out much.  He melts down in public a lot because it\u2019s too overwhelming.\n\nMy sister (32) wants to give us a \u201cpresent\u201d of a night out.  I made the dinner.  I gave a long list of things to entertain our son.  We were gone 4 hours.  Came home and found McDs wrappers and them watching her smartphone (movies on Prime).\n\nI went off and she told me I\u2019m being ridiculously militant with our son and he deserved some fun too.  Apparently the plan was always Door Dash and movies.  \n\nIt\u2019s been 4 days and his eating is way down.  The morning after he pulled out the burger wrapper and signed (ASL) more.  And he\u2019s been on a hunger strike since.\n\nWe don\u2019t have screens to refer to.  But he\u2019s grabbed my flip phone a few times and seems confused at the difference.  \n\nBasically I told my sister it will be a cold day in hell before she sees my kid again.

The sooner you start, the faster he will learn.\n\nTo the question: NTA - while some people may think you\u2019re too strict, as someone who works with developmentally different kids, I wish I had more parents like you. As a parent, you (generally) know what\u2019s best for your child, plus you\u2019re working in close conjunction with his therapists/doctors and incorporating their recommendations. I wish you and your son the best on this journey.", "You are doing a marvelous job with your son. Autism can be extremely challenging and you are working hard to do what's best for him.

How dare you try to prevent your son from becoming addicted to an unhealthy lifestyle, WTF MAN?!\n\nBut seriously, NTA", "NTA your sister was incredibly out of line and your family are ridiculous if they can't see that. I hope you have a quiet holiday without them and your son quickly forgets about the rubbish your sister exposed him to.", "NTA. Your sister was intentionally undermining your efforts to keep your son healthy. A hunger strike for four days? \nShe does not have to raise your son, you do, and she must respect your decisions here.", "NTA - I commend you for all you are doing to help your son be the best person possible.

Even WITHOUT the autism diagnosis, this is good. With it tho, it's likely even more important. \n\nI fail to see how limiting/stopping contact with someone who purposely goes against your parenting wishes can be bad. If they wanted to remain on contact, they would have respected your rules. They didn't care enough to do that, that's on them. \n\nThis isn't you being militant. You're being methodical, or systematic. His literal doctors have commended you for this. I'm sorry you're being disrespected this way, you definitely don't deserve it.", "NTA. I am in no way in a position to know how raising a child with autism is, but feedback from your doctors says you are doing everything right. You keep being you and I wish you and you son a merry Christmas.", "NTA. Your choices for your son are well thought-out and evidence-based, but thats beside the point. \nYour sister intentionally went against your direction for what to do when alone with your child,  resulting in complications to your very necessary routine that you are now required to deal with. Not ok. She broke your trust and there are consequences.", "NTA. Your sister is obviously welcome to hold whatever opinion she wants about your parenting, but you provided her with food and activities. She had to go out of her way to order take-out and ignore all your explicit instructions. Her offer to babysit, in retrospect, actually seems uncomfortably calculated to undermine you.", "NTA, good on your for doing absolutely everything you can for your son! That is seriously amazing, and I can\u2019t even imagine the sacrifices you make daily to provide him the best opportunities. Allow your family to be mad, you know what is best for your son.", "NTA. People who are not caregivers do not understand how their \u201ckindness\u201d can result in days/weeks/more of work for you. But also this feels like your sister has a completely different approach to parenting and even what it means to manage autism. \n\nIf they\u2019re mad, let them be mad. Keeping them happy with you is not as important as your kiddo\u2019s wellbeing. <3", "Hi, I'm autistic. Let's talk. Youre not necessarily an asshole for wanting your sister to respect your rules but GOD YTA. Are you planning to shelter your son all his life because you're so terrified he'll be like your brother? Guess what, you keep him sheltered he's gonna get overwhelmed when he's suddenly exposed to the world outside you. Everyone's autism is different but for me if I'm suddenly introduced to a thing and I like it then it's more likely I get fixated on it. I know several other people who are similar. If he wants a burger, try making him one. Talk to autistic adults for their advice. Especially autistic adults with autistic children. Expose him to things little by little. He's overwhelmed in public? Why? Did you ask him? If it's noise, try noise cancelling headphones. If it's anxiety then meds and therapy. Some things you can't change. For me, my sensory issues go nuts with smell and textures. Textures can be helped some ways but smells less so. That's fine. Doctors can be useful but a lot of them don't know anything about autism. Even if they do they know a hell of a lot less than autistic people. Talk to your son about what he needs. Talk to autistic people who might be able to offer advice. Don't be one of those moms that makes their kids autism their entire personality. You may be his parent, but he's the disabled one here. He's the one who has to live this life. Your job is to make it easier for him and do what he needs.", "NTA, at all.\n\nYour sister overstepped big time; you have every right to be angry and set harsh boundaries with her from now on.\n\nAlso, you sound like a great parent. Hats off to you for trying so hard to give your son a healthy and balanced life!", "NTA", "NTA.  You are doing the right thing for your son.", "While I don\u2019t think your sister was intentionally undermining the progress, I do think she was uneducated. You should educate her on what the affects have been of her little \u201cnight of fun\u201d.  She should know that it was a definite problem. So NTA .", "NAH.\n\nYou're trying to do what is best for your son.\n\nYour sister wanted to give her nephew a special treat because life is hard enough as it is. \n\nIf she knew it would cause a permanent reversal, I'm sure she wouldn't have done it. But I do question whether you're actually looking at a permanent reversal, or whether you're just being hyper-vigilant (requisite I'm not there and not a trained professional).\n\nBut now y'all know for next time. Don't have your sister babysit again, but berating her for breaking your child over a hamburger and YouTube isn't going to solve anything and is just going to alienate a much needed support network more generally.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

We believe he has a severe cognitive delay along with the autism.  So I can\u2019t ask him.  He does go out into public where he can.  But it\u2019s school, our hairdresser, his therapists, one restaurant and our small neighborhood grocery store.  Anyplace else he just starts to scream.  This is only indoor places, outside he is fine.  We do take him out with his therapists as we try to figure out how to make him comfortable in more places.  All the tricks you mentioned, tried and failed.  \n\nHe does eat burgers.  At home.  That I make.  He won\u2019t eat one since the McD.  \n\nWith all due respect, his experience with the cognitive issues along with the autism will mean he most likely will need full supportive care for a lifetime.  My brother is non-verbal, but can communicate using some sign and done other techniques.  He can do things for himself and doesn\u2019t have the cognitive issues.\n\nI\u2019m not attempting to make his autism diagnosis his entire personality.  But his limitations with comfort in public combined with my desire to keep him from a reliance on screens and processed food does limit our life.  He\u2019s only 5.

This.", "The point is is that she doesn't know anything about his progress and doesn't care, what was important to her was to spit in the poster's face.

I am an SLP and there is no one size fits all when it comes to AAC.", "I didn't really mean the \"junky food\", I was more talking about screens. I still think it's a little overboard to flip if your kid gets some McDonald's", " Not talking about his personality, autism is a major part of who someone is. I'm talking about the type of moms who act like they're the ones who have to live as an autistic person. You said your son signed earlier so I assumed he could communicate pretty well that way. I can't speak either and people tend to not actually talk to me and just talk to other people as if they know what I want. I'm sorry for assuming that was the situation here. For me, the internet and screens in general have given me access to community I otherwise wouldn't have and games and shows to keep me calm and entertained. The fast food is less of a thing that matters but I don't really understand the point of keeping it away from him either. Another assumption I'm sorry for was assuming he doesn't go anywhere. Personally with my autism and other disabilities I'm pretty home bound which brings me back to the screens. Maybe he won't be able to access community but I think it's a bit too much to not allow him to watch TV or movies. Having a movie or show that is comforting can be a great help to autistic people. I'm just one autistic person on the internet and I don't know your full situation but I do stand by what I said. Honestly, I think you need to make more of an effort to communicate with him. He may have cognitive delay but he still feels. There are lots of situations where communicating your needs is as simple as one word. Smell, sound, feeling. Are you signing with him or are you talking? That could be making it more difficult. There are also communication boards with pictures if that might help.", "So he's non-verbal, may have an intellectual delay, and you're denying him the thing that would make it easiest for him to communicate with the world because \\*checks notes\\*  your brother?     \n\n\nMa'am, I know you're coming from a good place, but you're doing him dirty.

Even if you think he should be using screens by this age, don\u2019t you think it should be introduced the right way and not just given to him with no restrictions/real supervision and without mom\u2019s permission? It wasn\u2019t the sister\u2019s choice to make. She knew what the expectations were and ignored them. If she was THAT concerned with the parenting she should have sat down for a serious convo instead of taking things into her own hands.", "It's not overboard to flip out over that when a direct consequence is that her 5 year old is now refusing to eat anything but an unhealthy processed food that doesnt meet nutritional requirements.", "Not according to his medical professionals.  \n\nSigned, a parent with a child of autism too", "Do you still feel this way knowing the doctor and the therapist say that for this particular child, at this particular age, OP is doing the right thing?", "I'm not praising the sister in law, what she did was wrong. I just don't think it qualifies an e s h", "Respectfully, I didn't come here to argue about parenting. I'm a teenager on the internet, that's not really my vibe. I just wanted to give op my perspective on the post as an autistic person.", "I understand that you might not be looking for an argument and are looking to offer a unique perspective and experience. However, understand that you enter a conversation with criticism and opinion, you are opening yourself up to debate and pushback regardless of your age or intentions. Your advice is valid for a great many situations relating to people with an autism diagnosis, but it isn't quite relevant in this particular situation and came across as accusatory.", "Preach!", "I'm sorry if it came off that way, I have problems with tone especially over text. I still dont understand why everyone wants to argue about food choices when I barely mentioned it in my original comment though.", "I understand; I'm not really trying to attack you, just bringing it up so you're aware for next time! The reason why people bring up the food thing is because it is a huge deal, especially for parents of children with difficulties eating. The concern with your response was that you seemed to minimize the damage that the sister did to OP's child by disrupting his routine and development. In the short term, McDonald's isnt a big deal; a one-time indulgence won't ruin his body. The issue here is that now OP's son may cause real harm to himself by refusing to eat. There are cases of kids literally putting themselves into the hospital because of food aversions. OP already mentioned he has issues with self-harm. With his issues, even one disruption can lead to months of disordered eating."]}
