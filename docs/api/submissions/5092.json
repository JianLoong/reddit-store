Computers are kept locked up and only used when he is not around.  We also avoid fast food, processed food, etc.  I know how easy it is for a picky palate to become dependent on processed foods or specific foods like McDs.  So we never, ever eat them because I don\u2019t want to introduce it.  Our son is limited in what he eats.  He wiol eat almost any fruit. He will eat a salad, but it needs to have one kind of dressing.  He only eats meat cooked certain ways.  He will only eat steamed veggies.  And the foods have to be separate.  \n\nOur OT therapist and DT therapist have said the lack of exposure to screens and processed foods have probably helped because our son is so severe.  He does eat more than most kids and more variety and he will use toys more because he has no screens.  \n\nSo with all these rules and the fact that our son really struggles with being off routine, we don\u2019t try to go out much.

Guess what, you keep him sheltered he's gonna get overwhelmed when he's suddenly exposed to the world outside you. Everyone's autism is different but for me if I'm suddenly introduced to a thing and I like it then it's more likely I get fixated on it. I know several other people who are similar. If he wants a burger, try making him one. Talk to autistic adults for their advice. Especially autistic adults with autistic children. Expose him to things little by little. He's overwhelmed in public? Why? Did you ask him? If it's noise, try noise cancelling headphones. If it's anxiety then meds and therapy. Some things you can't change. For me, my sensory issues go nuts with smell and textures. Textures can be helped some ways but smells less so. That's fine. Doctors can be useful but a lot of them don't know anything about autism. Even if they do they know a hell of a lot less than autistic people. Talk to your son about what he needs. Talk to autistic people who might be able to offer advice. Don't be one of those moms that makes their kids autism their entire personality. You may be his parent, but he's the disabled one here. He's the one who has to live this life. Your job is to make it easier for him and do what he needs.", "NTA, at all.\n\nYour sister overstepped big time; you have every right to be angry and set harsh boundaries with her from now on.\n\nAlso, you sound like a great parent.

I'm talking about the type of moms who act like they're the ones who have to live as an autistic person. You said your son signed earlier so I assumed he could communicate pretty well that way. I can't speak either and people tend to not actually talk to me and just talk to other people as if they know what I want. I'm sorry for assuming that was the situation here. For me, the internet and screens in general have given me access to community I otherwise wouldn't have and games and shows to keep me calm and entertained. The fast food is less of a thing that matters but I don't really understand the point of keeping it away from him either. Another assumption I'm sorry for was assuming he doesn't go anywhere. Personally with my autism and other disabilities I'm pretty home bound which brings me back to the screens. Maybe he won't be able to access community but I think it's a bit too much to not allow him to watch TV or movies. Having a movie or show that is comforting can be a great help to autistic people. I'm just one autistic person on the internet and I don't know your full situation but I do stand by what I said. Honestly, I think you need to make more of an effort to communicate with him. He may have cognitive delay but he still feels. There are lots of situations where communicating your needs is as simple as one word. Smell, sound, feeling.

In the short term, McDonald's isnt a big deal; a one-time indulgence won't ruin his body. The issue here is that now OP's son may cause real harm to himself by refusing to eat.

Rotenberg center is infamous for shocking their autistic kids.", "The thing with ABA is that is it built on terrible foundations. It was designed under the assumption that autistic people were essentially just Things that had Behaviours that needed to be changed. The founders of ABA were very open about not believing autistic people to be humans, and they believed that autistic people had no real internal thought to speak of so no real attempt was ever made to consider *why* the person might be acting as they are, because autistic 'people' don't have reasons for doing things they are just deranged children that make other people's lives difficult with their incomprehensible behaviour. \n\nAs a result of this attitude, very little was off the table by means of positive or negative reinforcement (in the sense of positive being something done or given to the person, and negative being something taken away) including physical abuse and pain, withholding of basic necessities, psychological abuse, physical and chemical restraint, removal of existing coping mechanisms, withholding of affection and attention from family etc. \n\nIt isn't uncommon to hear of these practices still in use across the world, but even where ABA has been cleaned up to look nicer, even where bits have been tacked on which claim to consider the person's reasoning for acting as they do, even where there have been attempts to treat autistic people as human while doing ABA, it's still a modality founded on the belief that you can learn everything you need to know about an autistic person through their behaviour. \n\nIt is still a modality obsessed with data and tracking the behaviours of autistic people above all else, where success is measured primarily, if not only, by numerical calculations of how certain behaviours have changed, with the wellbeing of the autistic person always being secondary, if it is considered at all (by the structure of the therapy itself, obviously individual practitioners and family may prioritise the autistic person's wellbeing, but the 'treatment' itself doesn't naturally factor that in). \n\nMy personal stipulation would be; surely we can do better? After all these decades, surely we can design a way of helping high-support autistic people and their families that has the basic fact of their humanity and autonomy baked into it's underlying assumptions instead of sometimes added in as an afterthought? Surely we can create something that has a more flexible and creative understanding of what wellbeing and living well can look like for the people who need this support, and of how to get there, instead of arbitrarily adding painful stimuli (exposure to known sensory stressors, physical reprimands, restraints, harsh criticism and insults etc.) and removing things the person needs/wants (such as sensory aids, comfort items, access to special interest material, affection and comfort from caregivers, any and all social contact by placing them in isolation etc.).", "[deleted]", "Jesus, I had no idea. I appreciate your explanation. When I was fresh out of undergrad I interviewed at a place that does ABA (this was when I was 22, over a decade ago, and my aunt had a friend there and got me an interview, I didn't know anything about it other than that they would train me in it). They had me sit in on a session and that's pretty much all I've seen of it, which was pretty much just fruit loops for eye contact, which is where I got the dog training impression. I mean a few years later I did literally the same exercise with my dogs. \n\nThe people I interviewed with were odd. They made it seem like working with autistic kids was a really terribly difficult thing and kept asking if I was sure I was up for it. After watching the session I didn't think it looked like the horrible experience they'd made it out to be, and I said so. They took that the wrong way and got really offended, as if *I'd* been the one saying it was so bad the whole time. The interview ended on a bad/weird note, but in hindsight I'm glad I didn't get that job. It would've set my career on a totally different trajectory.

Even for neurotypical folks, they can really struggle to stay off their phones. I've worked with some autistic kids who are glued to their phones from the time they wake up until the time they go to sleep, not constantly checking it and doing other stuff, but just in front of them at all times like the rest of the world doesn't exist.

We identified an alternative behavior (requesting a break from an adult and then receiving that break) for when they are overstimulated.

They are generally on a iPad or tablet, we use them with our students who are non-verbal or limited communication, many of them happen to be on Autism spectrum. So he would have see a screen then. But maybe I should be asking this instead, does he go to school yet? Because let me tell you this, those teachers will be certainly introducing him to screens, as most of curriculum is presented online now. Also, his little classmates will have lots of processed food.

I would certainly talk with a behaviorist and figure how better control his behavior without cutting things off.

Once their eating habits are established, they will change very little.  So they really just need to make it a few more years and then they can start introducing more things like processed food.  Conveniently, when the child is most likely to start and food restrictions is when the parents have the most control over what is available to eat.\n\nAlso with other behaviors, again the patters are established early in life.

ABA is a very broad term that can include what this person is talking about but also many other things. They are taking a very limited experience which is admittedly upsetting, and just applying it to an entire field with no real knowledge of the larger field.\n\nABA means \"Applied Behavior Analysis\". It basically means analyzing behavior to understand why something is happening and what it's goal is, and approaching it form that outlook. Let me give you an example of \"ABA\" I used with my own neurotypical child.\n\nSo, there's a concept in ABA called \"the ABCs of Behavior\" which is Antecedent, Behavior, Consequence. If a child is engaging in a behavior that problematic for some reason, you look at the antecedent (what comes before/triggers it), the behavior, and the consequence (what happens after). The idea is that if the child keeps doing something they presumably have a reason, and on some level it's doing what they want, meeting some need, etc. So it's \"reinforcing\" them. \n\nSo when my younger daughter was one she started intentionally whacking her head on the floor (this was not so subtle, being one. She's look right at me first to make sure I was nearby to see), then cry and hold out to be to be picked up and hugged. So looking at it I realized it would happen times when I wasn't holding her/doing something. She'd want a hug, she knew she always got picked up and hugged when she was hurt, so she would hurt herself to get the result of being picked up and hugged. This was a problem beacuse I didn't want her to hurt herself. So, I taught her a \"replacement behavior\" that would give her the same reinforcement appropriately. In this case that was saying/asking for a \"mama hug\". At times she seemed to want a hug/attention, or when she did the head whack and cry, I'd prompt her (the technical term) to ask for a mama hug. \"Oh honey, do you want a hug? Say hug\". Then, as soon as she said hug I'd pick her up and give her love and cuddles.\n\nSoon, she stopped whacking her head on the floor and just used the word hug to ask for hugs. (Though she cutely learned to say \"mama hug\" when all I tried to teach her was hug.)\n\nThis is ABA. And it's what I do at work, too. But with older kids you can talk to them about it more in depth then a one year old. I am currently working with a kid who runs out of class due to past trauma. The issue is we need to know where they are and that they are safe. So we are not only working on antecedents (things that lead them to feel a need to escape) but also working on them asking to take a break to calm down, for them to have a place to go to calm down, coping skills, etc. And that's a conversation we are having with them. \n\nI can explain more about PECS later, I worked briefly in a classroom that did that. But saying that ABA is \"conversion therapy\" and \"the same abusive break you down and make you ashamed to be alive tactics\" is an ignorant generalization. Beacuse ABA is so broad and just means analyzing behavior to understand and address behavior, it covers many different approaches. Some may well be problematic, especially older methods from the past. There are also complicated questions like what behaviors do we deem problematic and try to get someone to change? So if you are discouraging harmless behaviors just beacuse they are weird, that could arguably be wrong and what OP is talking about. But ABA could also be teaching a kid to bite a chewy and not their peers, and I think we all agree that's preferable?", "Lots of actually autistic people today, including academics, say it is damaging. Reading should include their accounts, including peer-reviewed articles that show there isn't a significant improvement for children who have undergone ABA. That includes work on the 'new' ABA.", "I'm so sorry for you and your sister. Your mom was an invaluable resource and won't be easily replaced as someone who could relate to the struggles.

Long term ABA therapy hasn't shown significant improvement because it can lead to dependence among other issues. \n\nABA isn't just a type of behavioral modification. It is also a framework/theoretical orientation that psychologists pull from. The research I have read (links below) indicates that people using ABA should have more training and reform should be done to address these issues.

Behavioral therapy is now focused on reinforcing positive behaviors and diminishing negative ones. I get that some folks don't like it and compare it to training a pet, but for kids who hurt themselves or others, finding replacement behaviors is absolutely necessary. It also builds skills like self care, self-regulation, and recognizing and communicating needs. Lots of folks assume all autistic folks are just odd and low support. Many need significant intervention to live safely and get their needs met. Also, basically all kids learn by positive reinforcement. Sticker charts for potty training, high fives and special treats for learning new skills are all acceptable in most cases unless the person in question is autistic. Autism is delays and differences in developmental as well as communication. It's not being quirky.", "you should look up who created ABA and its origin if you think it's not conversion therapy"]}
