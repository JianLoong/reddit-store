I lost my job as an RN because I couldn\u2019t find any child care for 13+ hours at a time. Long story short it\u2019s been extremely difficult. I haven\u2019t been able to find a clinic type or other less than 12 hr shift job. Because we\u2019re still married I\u2019ve been denied any state assistance. I was denied unemployment. I finally got a mortgage forbearance. \n\nTurns out it was not a job at all he left for, it was volunteering. He sent no money while away and in fact cried and screamed to me I was abandoning him if I didn\u2019t send him money. He called me crying saying he was depressed and he wanted to just die at war and he wasn\u2019t coming back. I (maybe stupidly) convinced him to come back and I used the last of my credit card to buy his ticket. He got back last Wednesday and he\u2019s like an entirely different person. He immediately said he\u2019s going back in January, just abandoning us again despite being on the verge of bankruptcy and foreclosure. \n\nHe won\u2019t shut up about Ukrainian everything and even said he wants us all to move there. He\u2019s acting like these random people he met there have been his friends for life and ignores all of us to talk to them. He wants me to pay for an EMT course for him for when he goes back over there. \n\nHe keeps having random anger outbursts screaming at me, our kids, throwing things. He wakes up every night at like 1 am demanding sex and then getting angry and screaming when I say I\u2019m tired or he perceives im not into it. Last night he kept me up for hours screaming at me because I denied him. He barricaded me in the bathroom and took my phone and threatened to run it under water so I couldn\u2019t call or record. \n\nWe\u2019re both veterans and I called the VA crisis line multiple times. They\u2019re connecting me to a social worker (in 24 hrs) but said only calling the police can have him committed. \n\nToday he was blatantly talking to a Ukrainian woman in my office and introduced them to my daughter. Then said she was his \u201cteacher.\u201d I told him to leave and he needed to check himself into the VA mental health clinic. He left for a while but then came back and shut himself in my office with a loaded shotgun. So I called the police. He heard me calling so then he called them himself as he locked up his shotgun and pretended like I was the problem. Long story short the cop laughed in my face and told me I could leave if I wanted to but I couldn\u2019t make my husband leave and he refused to call the mental health crisis team. He was cool as a cucumber and almost cavalier to the cop as they talked about \u201coh you know how women are.\u201d Now im looking at going to a shelter in the morning (it\u2019s full tonight).

I recommend you go to the police station and ask to sit with someone to take them through the timeline of your husbands behaviour. Provide as much proof as you can. Deliberately and calmly explain that you believe you and your child's safety is at risk, and ask them for help.", "NTA. For your safety and that of your children, you need to have your husband admitted. The VCL is correct that they cannot involuntarily admit him, but the police can. I am so sorry the police have failed you. I would recommend to continue calling - this keeps a record and documents what's going on. You can also call your VA directly - if you aren't already connected, you can call and they can start the process over the phone or you can come in person.\n\nSome steps you can take: look up involuntarily hospitalization laws in your state. In my state, anyone can go to the courthouse and request a mental inquest warrant, the judge will review it, and then police will pick him up. For your safety and your children's, when you are arguing with your husband, stay closer to the exits of your home. Don't go further and further into your home because you're more likely to get trapped that way. Document everything, but not in a place he can access. If the children have passports, they need to be stored outside the home with a trusted person.", "NTA but what you need is a divorce. Your husband is actively abusing you by the way he\u2019s treating you and your children. \nFile for divorce asap. Either throw him out of your marital home or move out and look for another job.\nAs an RN, there\u2019s so many options for you that you can do that don\u2019t require 12-13 hour shifts. GP office. Day units. Outpatients. Telehealth. Remote jobs that require a medical background - it won\u2019t be nursing but it\u2019s something!

All these things don't matter right now.\n\nRight now there's only one thing that is important: the safety of you and your daughter. Try to get him out of the house for a few hours (or wait till he leaves for whatever reason) and then leave.

If he's experienced a break through episode (reads like it), then there really isn't anything you can do except protect yourself and get as far away from him as possible.

I also had two alcoholic parents.  I am VERY, VERY familiar with different sides of those types of calls.\n\nUnfortunately, the response you'll receive is unpredictable because it depends so heavily on the officer's judgment (i.e. his past personal experiences and his personality.)

The lawyer needs to file the police complaint as well, as it'll have more merit.

When the police arrived they told me to stop being a brat and lying for attention, then watched tv with my dad for a few minutes chatting and laughing before they left. It was that attitude that made me never want to call the police when I was in danger again. It wasn\u2019t until over two years later that I had the courage to call them again after an assault that ended up with me in hospital - and to think they called me a brat lol"]}
