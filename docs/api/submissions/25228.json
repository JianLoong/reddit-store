I lost my job as an RN because I couldn\u2019t find any child care for 13+ hours at a time. Long story short it\u2019s been extremely difficult. I haven\u2019t been able to find a clinic type or other less than 12 hr shift job. Because we\u2019re still married I\u2019ve been denied any state assistance. I was denied unemployment. I finally got a mortgage forbearance. \n\nTurns out it was not a job at all he left for, it was volunteering. He sent no money while away and in fact cried and screamed to me I was abandoning him if I didn\u2019t send him money. He called me crying saying he was depressed and he wanted to just die at war and he wasn\u2019t coming back. I (maybe stupidly) convinced him to come back and I used the last of my credit card to buy his ticket. He got back last Wednesday and he\u2019s like an entirely different person. He immediately said he\u2019s going back in January, just abandoning us again despite being on the verge of bankruptcy and foreclosure. \n\nHe won\u2019t shut up about Ukrainian everything and even said he wants us all to move there. He\u2019s acting like these random people he met there have been his friends for life and ignores all of us to talk to them. He wants me to pay for an EMT course for him for when he goes back over there. \n\nHe keeps having random anger outbursts screaming at me, our kids, throwing things. He wakes up every night at like 1 am demanding sex and then getting angry and screaming when I say I\u2019m tired or he perceives im not into it. Last night he kept me up for hours screaming at me because I denied him. He barricaded me in the bathroom and took my phone and threatened to run it under water so I couldn\u2019t call or record. \n\nWe\u2019re both veterans and I called the VA crisis line multiple times. They\u2019re connecting me to a social worker (in 24 hrs) but said only calling the police can have him committed. \n\nToday he was blatantly talking to a Ukrainian woman in my office and introduced them to my daughter. Then said she was his \u201cteacher.\u201d I told him to leave and he needed to check himself into the VA mental health clinic. He left for a while but then came back and shut himself in my office with a loaded shotgun. So I called the police. He heard me calling so then he called them himself as he locked up his shotgun and pretended like I was the problem. Long story short the cop laughed in my face and told me I could leave if I wanted to but I couldn\u2019t make my husband leave and he refused to call the mental health crisis team. He was cool as a cucumber and almost cavalier to the cop as they talked about \u201coh you know how women are.\u201d Now im looking at going to a shelter in the morning (it\u2019s full tonight).
