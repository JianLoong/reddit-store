Over the years I\u2019ve got friendly with the guy who lives next door (I\u2019ll call him John) - we say hi whenever we see each other, we go for beers sometimes and our kids go to the same school.\n\nI can see John\u2019s garden from my upstairs window, and last Saturday John\u2019s daughter (who is 19 and I\u2019ll call Casey for this) was out there sunbathing and listening to some music. Now I get on pretty well with Casey and with John\u2019s other two kids - we\u2019re obviously not best friends, but whenever I see them (like with John) I say hi and we chat for a moment. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem - I wanted to say hi and at that particular moment Casey was putting some sunscreen on her arms, and so I jokingly shouted from my window;\n\n\u201cHi Casey! You missed a spot!\u201d\n\nTo my horror she looked up at me like I\u2019d just slapped her across the face, and got up and left the garden. A couple minutes later I get a very, very pissed off John at my door yelling at me for upsetting his daughter. I felt pretty bad (like a total creep honestly), and tried to explain that I\u2019d only been joking around and that I\u2019d never meant to make Casey feel weird, but John wouldn\u2019t listen to me. He honestly got pretty aggressive and told me that if I ever did a thing to upset her ever again I\u2019d deeply regret it.\n\nMy wife was out at the time, but when she came back and I explained the situation she was on my side and furious at John for threatening me.\n\nI totally accept that I upset Casey, which I\u2019m really sorry for and never meant to do. But I\u2019m not too happy with what John did either, and my wife thinks he was majorly overreacting by dishing out threats to me in my own house. \n\nI think I was stupid, but do you guys think I was the asshole?\n\n\nEDIT: In response to some commenters - when I said \u201cYou missed a spot\u201d it\u2019s not that I\u2019d just been looking at her long enough to determine where she hadn\u2019t put cream and that\u2019s why I said it. I just said it generally as a joke towards someone putting on sunscreen.

The fact that your wife has your back also should solidify that you are NTA as it was a mere joke. John though totally overreacted and is definitely the AH here. He should\u2019ve came and talked to you reasonably and then acted on what your intentions were. End of story.", "YTA - You, probably unintentionally, came off as very creepy.

YTA", "YTA.  Even if you had a good relationship where joking is common, that comment from a window puts you in the creep category.", "YTA. I know it wasn't intentional, but it can be seen as an adult male spying on a teenager. I see why her father freaked out. There are a lot of predators out there.", "YTA \n\nYou were watching her from an upstairs window and then commented so that she knew you were watching. I can understand why she felt creeped out and I actually don\u2019t think her dads response was out of line", "ESH.  You were so wrong to invade her privacy like that as she had reasonable reason to believe she was sunbathing in private although obviously your upstairs window overhangs their backyard.  Whatever, you had a lapse in judgement there and she clearly felt like you were being a peeping tom.  As for her father's reaction, that was a bit over the top too and unfortunate.  Perhaps if you'd known Casey better it wouldn't have mattered so much, but obviously that is not the way she saw it.  Sorry.  Maybe when the heat of the moment is past, you can speak again to your neighbor about what happened and how your intentions were not meant to be lewd but rather in jest.  Whatever, you invaded her privacy and went where you were not welcome.", "Look, soft yta +ESH.\nYou seem to be a decent dude and I can tell you didn't mean to be a creep but honestly you were kind of a creep... The thing with yards especially if they're fenced in is people feel that they should have a reasonable amount of privacy within them. I know you can see over this fence, but it's still a boundary. It sounds like you had a foot-in-mouth moment, her dad is right to be pissed off that you were a creep, even if it was unintentional. Threatening you may be a bit much, but for all you know she misheard you and thought you said \"you look hot\" or \"I tell you what!\" \"Id kiss that spot\" Ect. That's the thing about shouting out windows, you can easily miss facial cues and the finer point in phrases.\n\nYou need to wait until things calm down and then find a time where you can apologize to Casey, wholeheartedly and earnestly, and explain to her that you didn't mean to make her feel uncomfortable. Own that you shouldn't have been looking at her, and it was inappropriate for you to comment on her in this situation at all. Remember you are an adult male and are very powerful in a teen girl's eyes, any comment that you make directly or indirectly about her body feels threatening. That's just the world we live in.\n\nIt seems like you and John are pretty good friends and those are hard to come by in grown men so I would certainly say do your very best to not implode this friendship.", "Yta. You just know your neighbor. You are not friends with him let alone his daughter. If you knew the daughter grond when she was little and have a like good relationship what het than you could make that comment. But in this situation absolutely not.

So yeah big AH move.", "I am not going to make any assumptions re what you were doing at the window, how long you were standing there or why you felt the need to make sure she knew it.\n\nThat being said.

Honestly, I just chalk this up to a lapse in self-awareness. She didn't know she was being watched and that startled her. As a young woman, to contemplate how long my middle aged neighbor has been watching me apply suntan lotion...even if you didn't mean it to be, that is unsettling. Your neighbor is just doing the best he can by protecting his young daughter at all costs. I don't think there are \"sides\" to this, I think that you can do your best to be apologetic and earnest and hope that your neighbor friend sees that and understands.

But you apparently have been watching her invisibly from a window long enough to see that she has not rubbed cream on every inch of her body. So you shout at her that she has missed a spot. She jumps a mile! How long have you been watching? Do you always watch her sunbathing?  Have you watched her throughout her suncream application? Are you getting off on it? Why are you watching? Or commenting?  \n\nCan you see it yet?\n\nOf course YTA, women don't want or need comments like this. Why do some men feel it is their right to comment directly or indirectly on a woman's appearance? At 19 she probably gets more than her share of  sleezy behaviour and is probably on high alert for it. Good on her dad for sticking up for her.", "YTA and a creep.

Adults & kids don't have the same separation that they used to. None of my kids friends call adults Mr/Mrs. When I coached my kids teams, I had to repeatedly ask to be called coach or Mr Lastname. Adults even dress more like kids now. But, adult men interacting with teen girls has not changed; there are still creeps and many seem nice in the outside. I'll 100% stand up for you on how easy it was to forget for a moment, but you've got to realize that you f-ed up big time. \nThe real screw up was not owning your mistake. By standing your ground, you're literally saying that you want to defend your right to watch the neighbor girl and make comments about her appearance while she's not wearing much. You've dug a hole far deeper by trying to defend yourself. \nGo apologize for literally everything you did. Yes, no physical harm done and you had no ill intent. But you're old enough to know better. The harm was the shock to the girl. There's a good chance that she's not going to feel safe now in ways she felt safe before. It's a misunderstanding gone wild, but you created it.", "YTA. The main thing here is she was in her own garden, and you were looking at her from your own upstairs window. If she's in her garden she wants some sort of privacy, so you really shouldnt talk to her if shes sunbathing too. If you were gonna talk to her, you should have just said something else first instead of your joke, atleast just say 'Hi Casey' so she knows you're there and that you're not just being a creep.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m not even sure why you\u2019re engaging in conversation with his kids. Stay away dude. Understand you\u2019re middle-aged now and adjust your behaviour.", "NAH. You weren't watching her or staring at her for a long period time and didn't intend to make her upset, but at the same time Casey has a right to feel upset by this because she's a young girl and you're an older man. Casey's father also isn't in the wrong because he likely wants to keep his daughter from harm. I think it'd be best to either try and apologize to Casey in-person, or if you feel like that would make it worse, just leave it be.", "YTA and a creep.  Saw her in the garden, should have just looked away.  You were looking at her.", "Clearly u two don\u2019t have that kind of friendly relationship", "YTA but unintentionally. Yes it was creepy but the fact that you acknowledge that you feel bad about it seems to indicate you didn't have bad intentions. It was very poor judgment though and I'll bet you won't make the same kind of mistake in the future.", "That is so creepy. YTA. If you yelled at my teenager daughter sunbathing in our yard, from your second floor, I would have reacted the same way.", "Yeesh. If you don't know how creepy that sounds...YTA and if you were my neighbor I'd be installing a fence so high you'd never be able to see into my yard.  IMO, your only option when you saw her was to turn away and move on with your day.", "NTA", "Nta neighbor overreacted", "It's just a comment and wasn't meant to hurt anyone and when you're comfortable with ppl you don't guard your speech. You apologized. I'd leave it at that. Now you probably won't talk anymore. Oh well", ">The action I took that should be judged is what I said to Casey\n\nnaw, naw, he specificaly said: \"The action I took that should be judged is what I said to Casey\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso what he SAID.   \n\n\n  \n/s", "He didn\u2019t say he was watching her, it\u2019s a very feeble joke - kind of like seeing a couple going by on a tandem bike and yelling out to the one in front that the one in back isn\u2019t pedaling!\n\nIf he had been watching her that\u2019s incredibly creepy but he doesn\u2019t sound like he was - he just came out with an old, unfunny joke that made him *sound* like a creep. He doesn\u2019t come across as if he *is* a creep.", "Exactly. It\u2019s a pretty standard social rule that when someone is doing something in the privacy of their own backyard, especially something kind of vulnerable, you don\u2019t acknowledge it. She\u2019s never going to feel safe tanning in her yard again.\n\nBut I disagree that John overreacted.", "John absolutely didnt overreact, OP is an AH and clearly gets the message now, maybe next time he wont creep on his neighbors daughter", "THIS. People need to think about how stuff like this looks to the person being shouted at. She has no idea he wasn\u2019t staring at her the whole time. Of course they\u2019re pissed.", "I think because I\u2019m older a lot of people are missing that this used to be a *standard* feeble joke people would use. These days it\u2019s understood as creepy but in no way does it mean he was *actually* watching her. He just trotted out the old joke without thinking about how times have changed and that it would now be read as creepy.", "If he really felt bad and saw how creepy this is, he wouldn\u2019t be on a subreddit asking if he\u2019s an asshole.", "If he knew he was wrong he wouldn\u2019t be posting to Reddit for sympathy", "If he gets it, then why is he posting here?", "Maybe of people of equal standing.  Not a middle age dude to a teenage girl, one dressed the other less (not like they both at pool doing same thing) from a distance without the target knowing, so not even in passing.  Maybe it was different before the 90s but in the 90s we considered that flirting", "I\u2019m older too and I think people are missing that this used to be a *standard* feeble joke. I spend a lot of time trying to tell my 70 year old husband that no, we\u2019re not allowed to say things like that any more, people might think you had *actually* been watching her. \n\nIt still comes across as creepy these days but I think it\u2019s more changing times.", "Exactly. He\u2019d be here asking for advice about how to put this right.", "He's not like a regular neighbour, he's a *cool* neighbour", "I could see how it was meant as a joke but can also see how the situation would have been perceived coming from the POV of the daughter and her father.\n\nFor the sake of neighborly communication, give them a little time to cool off. Then openly apologize for the misunderstanding. Maybe you can have a bbq or something and invite them over?\n\nRecognize that this was a very creepy situation for the daughter and her father and maybe not look out the window if you can? \n\nI believe you truly meant it as a joke. It's judt a sticky situation.", "\u201cHey, Casey!

If John has any sense at all, he knows that friends of the family are common culprits of sexual abuse of minors. Casey may not be a minor anymore, but I bet she's still \"his little girl\" in his mind. \n\nI get it, \"you missed a spot\" is supposed to be a tired joke that is barely funny except for a sense of shared irony. But context matters a whole lot, and you failed to notice that you are a middle aged man calling down to a young woman not even out of her teens in her own backyard until it was too late.\n\nTake the L, save your apologies until John and Casey are ready to hear them, do not get defensive. Actually, do not talk to Casey at all unless she speaks to you first; if and when John accepts your apology then you can ask him how Casey wants to receive your apology. But you might have burned a bridge with your impulsivity, and now you gotta live with the consequences.", "Let\u2019s just say that as a woman, I would never sunbathe in my yard again if I was in her shoes. YTA for sure.", "YTA, you creepy fuck. I say this as a fellow middle aged man who would probably also let something stupid like that escape my lips and then realize it's terrible and accept being put on blast as deserved.", "YTA. You wanted to say hi to someone minding their own business in their backyard??\n\nNo, you wanted to creep on this girl and thought you could get away with it.", "YTA. You really didn\u2019t think she would get upset? You seem like a creeper. You maybe didn\u2019t mean to come across that way, but it\u2019s 2023. She was sunbathing in her own yard. Stop watching your neighbor and mind your own business.", "YTA. You just turned yourself into that creepy guy, mean it or not.  My eldest daughters would have reacted the same way, as would my husband.  You could try texting another apology after they have cooled down but don\u2019t be surprised if he ignores you.", "YTA creep", "YTA, don't apologize to directly her for the love of God. Apologize to her dad and say you are sorry for scaring a young girl in her own home and won't again. Then follow my advice and don't talk to her again. You are likely now a creeper to her and if you try to engage it will only cement that. If she wants to talk to you keep it brief and polite. \n\nJohn's kid came in distressed and he operated on emotion. I'm glad he talked to you in a way because it likely means that girl will seek relationships with people who back her. But threatening is bad. \n\nThat would've messed me up as a teen and made me feel gross for a reason I couldn't put my finger on. Yuck.", "Absolutely creepy, predatory behaviour. YTA.", "Unfortunately YTA you just had a foot in mouth moment.\n\nOf course a teenage girl will find it creepy that you spoke to her from your window, while you were looking down at her partially clothed.\n\nIt\u2019s not that you were a creep, it\u2019s that you were inadvertently in a position of power there where you could see her without her knowing, and she was vulnerable being almost nude. I doubt she expected anyone but her family to see her in the backyard sunbathing.", "YTA\n\nAt best, you were an idiot. At worst, a creep.\n\nPeople want privacy in their own homes. They don't want their neighbours spying on them. Teenage girls in particular do not want their old male neighbours spying on them whilst they're in their garden. Come on.", "YTA. I know you did not mean to offend your friends daughter, but you are a middle aged man, and Your friend\u2019s daughter is 19. The comment you made to her can be vastly taken out of context and assumed that you wanted to mess with her in an inappropriate manner.", "you're an adult, you're supposed to think before you talk and it's completely understandable that John wouldn't listen to reason because the whole thing sounded like you were creepily staring at his daughter.\n\nYTA, think before you talk, for your own sake", "YTA.  Sorry dude. But I have a neighbor who did something like this and it COMPLETELY ruined my sense of privacy and I constantly look at that window if I\u2019m outside to make sure I\u2019m not being watched.  I almost never go outside to do yoga or anything like that anymore, because I just can never relax.  I don\u2019t have a dad to make sure the person doesn\u2019t feel comfortable doing that again and I DONT feel comfortable doing it myself.  I\u2019m 28.  I can only imagine how much more terrifying that must have been as a minor.  Their reaction is because SO MANY neighbors turn out to be peeping toms/creeps it\u2019s only safe to be straight forward about NOT allowing that kind of thing to EVER happen again. Sometimes being TOO nice could imply that \u201cit wasn\u2019t that big of a deal\u201d but it IS.", "YTA.\n\nFun fact!!\n\n\nMost creeps are oblivious to the fact that they are creeps.\n\n\nIn case there's any misunderstanding, that was a creep thing to do. You're the creep. You.", "You may not have meant it in a creepy way but there\u2019s that pesky \u201cintention vs impact\u201d. You\u2019re just a middle aged dude watching her through a window.

I assume probably in shorts and a t shirt, maybe a vest. she's applying sun cream and suddenly her older male neighbour sticks his head out the window and shouts that she missed a spot. she doesn't know how long he's been there. was he watching her for ages? and why? was she putting on a show for him? did he enjoy watching her put it on her legs? she's seen movies where the female seduces the male by moisturising her legs. so she feels scared, she feels violated and she tells her father that neighbour across the road watched her put on sun cream and shouts that she missed a spot and she didnt like it and she felt creeped out. John hears this and goes to defend his daughter. \n\nYTA. even if you didn't mean it, I don't think John was overreacting, and neither was Casey. you know it was an innocent comment, but she doesn't know that. I suggest waiting for tempers to die down and explain your side to John.", "You already know that you are. If John overreacted or not that doesn't change. Not sure what you can do about it except give it a week and then go talk to John when the kids aren't there and apologize again, and hope he accepts once he is calmer.", "I'm not willing to say YTA, cuz I believe it was an honest mistake, and you were trying to be funny.\n\nThat said John reacted like most fathers would when someone upset their daughter especially when they were in a SOMEWHAT exposed state. \n\nI mean whether it was intentional or not she probably didn't realize you just happened to look out the window and was probably freaked out by seeing you there and your comment. \n\nI know you already feel bad enough, but you can't really blame him for trying to protect his young daughter.", "NTA", "Oh man OP, you hung yourself good with that Dad joke.\n\nEven reading this in the most harmless light (OP wasn't lingering in the looking and just snapped off the silly call out), it surprised someone having a private time in their yard.

Keep your head on your shoulders and be a little more aware next time.\n\nYTA.", "ESH - it was a bad joke, but one that you immediately realized was inappropriate and tried repeatedly to apologize for. People make mistakes and responding the way your neighbor did is also not appropriate AT ALL. I agree with your wife that he should be apologizing to you. \n\nReference: I am a young woman, work around a lot of older men, and have received my fair share of odd/inappropriate \u201cjokes.\u201d They\u2019re not great, but intention and history matter. If you\u2019ve known these people a long time without issue and accidentally say something stupid once, if I were on the receiving end I would brush this one off.", "YTA. That was creepy as hell!", "You are NTA. But remember this in the future when you make any, and I mean **any** comment about a teenage girl. It **WILL** be interpreted as creepy. Regardless of whether it was or not.\n\n- Someone who was once a Teenage Girl", "Here's the thing. People don't want to know that their neighbours can see them in their backyard. Because that's supposed to be a safe space. Casey doesn't know how long you may or may not have been looking at her. What she does know is that you made it known that you could see her, and made her feel (probably) objectified and unsafe.\n\nSo it doesn't matter that you only noticed her, and were only joking. To her it felt creepy. Doesn't make you an asshole, but its a miscalculation, and a lesson learned. \n\nNAH", "NTA. The 'missed a spot' is a universally understood joke. Maybe you misunderstood your relationship with your neighbours, that you are not as close as you think you are. If you were friends and as close as you say you are, then that joke would have gone over well. I think your neighbours don't see you as a friend. Friends don't make threats over a very well-known joke. So, from their POV, their neighbour is a creep, and they don't see you as friends. As a neighbour doing this WOULD be creepy.\n\nI think it is WAY too far to call you an arsehole, but you need to accept these people are NOT your friends.", "NTa. It was an innocent joke but people are over sensitive about everything these days.  I\u2019d let him cool down and apologize again. But I\u2019d also warn him he would never be threatening me again.", "Yeah, you messed up. Just take the L and apologize. Nothing else to do. You were in the wrong even though you meant no harm. The reality is that we don't need to intend to cause harm for harm to occur. People should feel safe and comfortable in their own yard. Startling someone (especially a young woman) is not the move. Even if you didn't mean anything by it, the right thing to do is to fully accept responsibility, apologize, and give them space and time.", "Damn really fucked this one up didn't you like Jesus Christ how stupid are you in surprised that they didn't call the cops now imagine this who ever you are whenever middle aged men now stay with me here when middle age men stare at young girls sunbathing it's pretty creepy I hope you were able to somehow keep that in your empty skull", "YTA", "YTA! Casey will never feel safe or comfortable in her own backyard again because of YOUR actions. You felt like a creep because you were BEING a creep.", "YTA. Intention isn\u2019t always the key factor. Like it or not you, a middle aged man, made a comment to a teenage girl that was taken as creepy, and I think you know why it can be seen that way. Apologise and don\u2019t do it again, it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re the asshole or not, you made a much younger woman feel objectified regardless of your intention.", "YTA. What is it with people thinking it\u2019s okay to make weird off handed comments to teenagers? No it\u2019s not okay. This is creepy.", "NTA especially with your edit.

On the one hand, young women are equal to young men, no judgement against them if they are sunbathing under your window practically nude, etc. On the other hand, treat them as if they are a guy by calling out a lame sunscreen joke and suddenly they are weak victims of unwanted suggestive behavior. Sorry, my dude, but there is nothing to be done about this bewildering situation except apologize profusely to the dad, trying to make clear you were treating her like any other friendly acquaintance, stay clear of the girl from now on with eyes averted at all times, and never, ever make an unsolicited comment on any subject to any woman you are not related to or working with. Good luck. I'm so glad I'm not a middle-aged dude!", "NTA. A regrettable situation that someone is overreacting about. Clearly she told a slightly modified version of what happened and of course dad is going to flip his wig.", "Of course YTA you massive fucking plum.", "NAH. From how it sounds, you happened to look out the window as she applied some sun lotion and made a joke. The daughter isn't an AH, you caught her off guard and how was she felt you were there the whole time. In John's defense, he didn't know the full story, so he probably assumed from what he heard that you were watching the whole time. I think he had a fair reaction so I don't wanna say hes an AH, he's just protecting his daughter. Give it some time, let him cool down, and maybe you can explain that you weren't watching, just wanted to say hi but instead chose a joke. And maybe next time just mind your business. I don't mean it in a rude way, but like you said, y'all aren't all that close, just close enough that you said hi if y'all happen to see each other when you leave.", "I mean you know that it was creepy. Idk about asshole move, but sure came off creepy. I think the better question would be is your neighbor the asshole for threatening you over it.", "You know that you messed up.  You need to apologize to John and Casey.  I know you said you tried to explain but I am thinking that came across as trying to excuse your behavior. \n\nYour intentions were not bad but you did scare her and gave the impression you were watching her.  It may be very hard to go back to the way things were, but if you sincerely apologize and assure John and Casey that you don't watch her when she is outside and you feel terible for scaring her, maybe you can move forward from here.", "NTA\n\nYou thought you were just casually joking around but inadvertently stepped in it and made his daughter uncomfortable.

But that was very stupid. You should have thought about it a second longer.\n\nWait a few days, then try and explain yourself to John. Explain to him that you were stupid and didn\u2019t think. You were just walking by the window not watching.\n\nHopefully you can get this smoothed over.\n\nDo not attempt to apologise to Casey until after you have made up with John, and only if John thinks it\u2019s a good idea.", "Soft YTA. You didn\u2019t mean to, but you did something deeply disturbing.", "ETA\n\nLook, I am taking your post at face value and assume you aren't a creepy perv and just a guy who makes bad jokes while trying to be friendly. But you have to realize this isn't the time or the place. It is a girl sunbathing. She isn't trying to attract attention. She's in the privacy of her back yard. Any dude shouting out at her is going to come across as just gross.\n\nYour neighbor also didn't need to come at you violently without any sort of explanation. But he feels like he's protecting his daughter from a nasty neighbor. All he hears is that there is an older guy watching his daughter while she sunbathes and making uncomfortable comments.\n\nIn short. There are no angels here. But no devils either. I would wait for a few days to let everyone cool down and ask to speak to your neighbor. First, I'd start with an apology. Then I would explain the situation. STRESSING the fact that you hadn't been ogling at her, but that you made a very poor joke and you understand your mistake. You can ask him to apologize to his daughter on your behalf and say you would never want her to feel unsafe in her yard and that you feel badly about it. You could also let him know that at first you were upset by the aggression with which he attacked you without taking time to understand the situation, but you are also a parent and forgive him his anger. End with telling him that you hope to be a good neighbor and tell him you are always open to calm conversation whenever there are misunderstandings or disputes in the future. \n\nI understand that you don't feel like you did anything wrong. And you probably don't feel like you should apologize. But put your ego aside and think that maybe that 19 yr old has had things happen to her that immediately make her frightened of a man shouting at her and make her dad react the way he did. Try to think of how you'd defend your own kid if the situations were reversed. Empathy and a level head can work wonders.", "YTA-The perception of your actions outweigh the intentions of your actions in this case.\n\n\nIt's very scary indeed to feel watched, to feel an older man is being a \"creep\" on you as your vulnerable and damn near nude. It's not just upsetness, it's a true uneasiness/fear. \n\n \nI do believe you had good intentions. But man.. the perception I as a parent or I as i was as a 19 year old girl (or even now at my age tbh) would be the same as theirs was. I hate to say.. but you've done made yourself look like an ol creeper lol. I do hope you manage to find a way to solve this.", "YTA. But you have some grace. Let some time pass. I get the joke.

Remember this lesson.", "Gentle YTA\n\nI believe that you didn\u2019t intend to be creepy. However, that situation seemed fairly obvious to me. Middle aged neighbor yells something implying he\u2019s been watching teenage girl sunbath, where to likely assumed no one could se her.

You made a mistake, doesn\u2019t sound like you\u2019re a creep, what I\u2019d say it just let them know you meant it as a funny hello, but you completely understand that it came out wrong, and you\u2019re very sorry about it. Your wife it on your side because she knows you aren\u2019t a creep, your neighbor doesn\u2019t.", "This would creep me out, too. That comment implies you were watching her.

But a neighbor you are friendly with? I dont really get why she got upset.\n\nCasey and her father need to chill.", "Idk about being an AH but at your age, you should have thought through your words a little more before shouting out the window because that is 100% creep behaviour. Having known the family that long though, I feel like dad coming over and saying something is fine but threats were probably a bit much. He could have heard out your apology. Obviously(hopefully), you've learned your lesson. I think both of you went too far", "ESH\n\nYou know you messed up but at least you apologised.\n\nThere was no reason for him to threaten you. Your apology should have been accepted.", "YTA it was creepy which you acknowledged and that\u2019s that. I get what you mean about it being a joke but if I were her there is no way I\u2019d think it\u2019s funny. I\u2019d be so creeped out and I\u2019d feel uncomfortable sunbathing with someone like that around. again I get your intent but unfortunately it did not come across.

I don't think you meant to be or you wouldn't be so upset by it, but it was creepy. Your neighbor shouldn't have threatened you, but in his defense he probably thought you were creeping on his daughter. You apologized for making her feel weird, that's all you can do. He may get over it or he may not. I think it is good though that you realize it was creepy and you didn't mean anything by it but you recognize your mistake. I would knock on his door and have an honest conversation if it were me. Tell him you didn't mean to come across as a perv you just made a bad joke and error in judgement.", "INFO: OP, are you British?

Even I\u2019d be creeped out if that had happened to me while I was in my own backyard minding my own business. It was inappropriate on your part.", "Definitely stupid, but NTA.", "YTA - not a big one, but you didn't think about how it would make her feel. Not many men do. She probably felt startled and then grossed out not knowing how long you were staring at her. That's her POV - it's creepy. Too bad you didn't think it thru.", "ESH , but i don\u2019t think you\u2019re an AH. Sounds like you thought you had a different relationship than you thought you did with your neighbors. I can understand as a woman how she probably felt uncomfortable but it seems that her father blew it a little out of proportion. You didn\u2019t intend to be creepy but that\u2019s how it came off regardless. From now on, i just wouldn\u2019t say hi to her regardless of how innocent it may seem.", "I will go NAH with a big caveat.  The caveat being that I am taking you at your word that you were not being creepy which is what anyone would say of course.  If so it was just a clumsy dad thing to say.   Now as a father of teenage girls I completely understand John\u2019s reaction. It is his best course of action to assume you are a creep because assuming the alternate and being wrong has far worse consequences.  As a father I assume everyone is a creep and protect my kids.  If he actually attacks you then he crosses the line.  You said your apology, give them time to cool down escalating could get really ugly.", "No one is an asshole over here. You just vomited some words that were taken the wrong way. Sorry about all of this.", "I think a sincere apology to her in front of her parents. Let them know he was just trying to be funny and he realized how stupid it was and he will black out his upstairs windows so that she never has to feel uncomfortable again. If he doesn\u2019t do that it\u2019s going to be forever icky and awkward with the neighbors.  Bite the bullet buddy. Be really sorry.", "YTA. But you seem like you already understand that. Either they accept the apology, or they don't. It's a shit time again to be a woman in the US (?), and it's understandable that she'd be creeped out. You seem to already understand this though. Just know you can't force an acceptance of the apology.", "YTA\n\nWhy are you staring at a 19 year old who is sun bathing?\n\nThe way this should've gone is \"oh, Casey is out side sun bathing, I'll walk away and give her some privacy.\"\n\nEven if you meant it playfully. You aren't friends, therefore shouldn't be making friend commentary. \"You missed a spot\" to her it's like you were staring out the window at her.", "YTA\n\nYea dude, you fucked up and you at least have the self awareness to recognize it.  It was creepy as fuck, and only ever going to be taken that way.  Did your neighbor take it too far?  Probably a bit, but he was likely feeling very protective against possible sexual assault that made him do that.  \n\nHonestly, catch him on a friendlier day and explain yourself and apologize.  Buy him a round at the bar.  And don't ever comment on his daughter being pretty or what not.", "YTA, you creep!

I guess not tho lol. \n\nHe says stuff to women sometimes that to HIM is innocent enough but I can see the cringe and awkwardness (and sometimes annoyance) on their faces when he says stuff. And when his kids (me and my siblings) call him out he gets really defensive and doesn\u2019t understand why talking to certain people a certain way is not appropriate lol. Like, i know this will sound a but weird but my older sister (his stepdaughter)  is conventionally very attractive, and yesterday while I was helping him with some yard work he goes \u201cso\u2026. Your sisters gaining weight, huh?\u201d And in my head I\u2019m thinking to myself why would I notice that I don\u2019t spend any time looking at my sisters body enough to detect like 10 pounds of weight gain.

And THEN my second thought is like \u201cpops why tf are YOU looking at my sister long enough to conclude that she\u2019s gained like MAXIMUM ten pounds\u2026.

Your intentions were completely innocent and in line with how you\u2019ve interacted with John in the past, and I totally understand wanting to say hi if you noticed she was there while passing the window if you\u2019re all friendly with each other. But from her perspective she was having some solo leisure time in the sun, behind a fence I assume, and that was suddenly invaded by someone who\u2019d been observing her from above for who knows how long? Then of course John would rightfully be upset with you for scaring his daughter and invading her personal space/time and would jump to her defense. I know this isn\u2019t an advice column but you could consider writing them an apologetic letter and maybe offering to help find a solution to ensure their privacy in the future, like paying to add some height to the fence or something. I\u2019m sure they don\u2019t want a ruined relationship with their neighbor any more than you do, but they probably need to feel that their comfort is a priority to you in order to rebuild trust at this point.", "Her dads response is\u2026 exactly what I would expect.

Putting on sunscreen can be a very intimate act, especially if you are alone.", "Yep. He may not have intended it as catcalling, but that's absolutely what I would interpret that behavior as if I witnessed it.

That pervert will always only be a wall or two away from my daughter, I'd want them to be scared to even look at her.

I'd want him to know I will 100% react and act asap if he interacts with my daughter inappropriately so he'd be too scared to.\n\nI'm also a woman - if you want to brush it off it's fine but doesn't mean all women should feel how you do.", "They act like he was staring at her longingly.

In that being angry is warranted but their history may grant a small amount of benefit of the doubt and a moment of hearing his friends side. Rather than say if they were relative strangers and their only interaction is this instance of inappropriate behaviour, so drawing a solid line of expectation, not knowing what OP is capable of, an aggressive approach is usually the standard reaction.\nBut I\u2019ve been thinking about this more.\nThe reaction from John has got to be coming from somewhere. You don\u2019t burn a friendship down over an \u201cinnocent joke\u201d right? Like there has to be some missing pieces to the whole picture. \nMaybe I\u2019m overthinking it.\n\nEdit for clarity. I completely agree that John should have confronted OP. It was absolutely inappropriate of OP. I would absolutely be having an angry word with my neighbour if Casey was my daughter.

Gross.", "Yeah, the thing that got me was that he did this through an upstairs window. If a neighbor said hello to me in my backyard *from their upstairs window,* I'd never feel safe in my backyard again. Idgaf about their intent b/c now I'd know they could watch me back there without me even knowing at any time.", "Fine. There are many different scenarios and dynamics, some of which that is the case. It is still my opinion that OP was not doing this.", "Yes, wow, thank you for your very original commentary. I still don\u2019t think it makes sense in this situation that he would do that.", "I think he\u2019s hoping that people will say, look, bud, yeah, you made a mistake but you\u2019re not a horrible person. That\u2019s what I want to say to him.\n\nI think he should write a letter of apology to the dad and the daughter - I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t think about what I said - I won\u2019t bother you folks again - and then never speak to anyone in the neighbour\u2019s family again.", "Idk if some man yelled anything about my kid\u2019s body out a window, I\u2019d automatically be on the defense. \n\nThe dad was setting hard boundaries on respecting his daughter and good for him.", "> I didn\u2019t get the impression he was defending himself\n\nhe somehow conveyed this story to his wife and she supports his side...", "Someone recently pointed out that the cat calls often slow dramatically when you're obviously an adult woman instead of a child.", ">We're talking about someone she knows, and has known for a while, so it's not exactly the same thing.\n\nYou're right - it's so much worse when it's someone you thought was ok and can't escape because he knows where you live and you have to see him every day and now you'll never feel safe in your own home ever again than it is when it's some weirdo on a bus that you'll never see again.", "How is that even remotely cat calling, lol. Not even fucking close. He literally pulled out one of the oldest Dad jokes of the century. Now if he said something like \u201chey, nice tan lines!\u201d Or \u201clookin\u2019 good out there!\u201d etc, Then yeah, I would agree that is cat calling and would be creepy. Simply saying \u201cYou missed a spot\u201d as joke with ZERO sexual intent or pervasive intent, and accusing the OP as a creepy cat caller is just straight up incorrect. Keep reaching though.", "I think you missed a spot.", "I get where you're coming from, but when you're a teenager you don't have the life experience to make those judgement calls, and it's unreasonable to expect Casey to tamp down on her fight/flight impulse and make it her responsibility to make OP feel better about making her feel scared and scrutinised.", "That\u2019s fine for you, but not all women feel like you do. Some women don\u2019t feel like the harasser\u2019s intent matters- just the fact that they felt uncomfortable or unsafe during the interaction. \n\nAnd I\u2019m sorry- every creepy perv says he \u201cmeans well\u201d and didn\u2019t *intend* for the woman to *misinterpret* his *harmless* joke. That puts all the blame on the woman for being humorless and too sensitive, and the guy ends up avoiding any accountability.", "I totally agree, and I would add to it. That \"you missed a spot\" joke has been around forever. I personally read it as a funny way to say hi to the neighbor's kid. Only he didn't have enough of a rapport, unfortunately.", "I totally agree. I don't know why people are jumping down your throat for this comment.", "\"What a fun, harmless, and totally normal interaction\" the middle aged man thought to himself. \n\nThis is legit the problem, that it took making a teenage girl feel unsafe in her own home to even remotely reflect on how inappropriate his behaviour was. And yet somehow he still wanted to let his beer buddy/her enraged father know that while he was sorry, *it was just a joke after all*.", "Tf are you doing in your back garden that you'd be scared of people seeing \ud83d\udc40", "I don\u2019t understand why any adult would think it appropriate to yell that out of a window at a sunbathing teenager that\u2019s not their own child, especially an adult man to a teenage girl.\n\nThere\u2019s just no way that wouldn\u2019t sound sexual or at least uncomfortable", "He literally admitted to yelling?? out the window?? to his neighbor?? \n\nYou saying \u201cit doesn\u2019t make sense\u201d is your own issue lol. He specifically said he\u2019d yelled & goes as far as admitting he can see why she\u2019s uncomfortable. \n\nBecause she felt like he was being pervy. \n\nWhether he was or wasn\u2019t isn\u2019t relevant, bc what landed was \u201cmuch older man commenting on teenager\u2019s body\u201d. \n\nLike, the harm was done. Overreaction or not, it upset her. Maybe dad shouldn\u2019t have threatened to end OP\u2019s life, lol, but we also don\u2019t know if she\u2019s been harassed seriously before.", "Walking into someone\u2019s house and threatening them is not \u201chealthy boundary setting.\u201d", "I never said any of that and absolutely agree with you. Her Dad is also totally justified in wanting to have a word with OP about it. However, I also think showing up on someone\u2019s doorstep threatening them without any attempt at clarification is unreasonable given the context.", "Exactly and even with the OP trying to explain to John that he wasn't actually watching his daughter it now seems to John like he may be just be lying to cover his ass.", "Also a woman also consider intent in the men that say things to me including cat calls. \n\nPeople are stupid and they say stupid things. \n\nPlease consider that we women are individuals and we don\u2019t all have to think like you or like myself and the previous poster.", "Seriously! Consider the history and believed 'intent' of the long list of preachers, pastors, etc., that sexually harmed people who they were supposed to help.", "MISSED A SPOT.", "Seriously? Because I have a different opinion means my experience as a woman literally doesn\u2019t exist? Get over yourself.", "Right! This is as dangerous as \"boys will be boys\" comments when they act inappropriately. Excusing shitty male behaviour as innocent. \n\nImagine being 19 and having a neighbor you thought was ok and then realizing he's a total creep. So much ewww in the whole scenario and I bet OP still doesn't understand how gross it is.", "Says the person who just tried to represent all women's experiences...", "Can't roll my eyes hard enough at you", "You missed a spot.", "I\u2019m not disagreeing, but people make mistakes, idk what else to tell you.", "Show me where he walked in. OP said he showed up at the door and told him to never talk to his daughter that way again.", "I didnt say they don\u2019t. But you excusing their behavior and saying it isn\u2019t creepy behavior when they do it doesn\u2019t help other women either.", "I almost never comment on threads like this but the whole \u201cboys will be boys\u201d thing had me.  As a parent of two daughters and a male myself I hate it so much when people say this.   No, your kid (or parent) is a total jackass.   Sure some people are different than others and it isn\u2019t even based on sex, it gives you no excuse to dismiss being a jackass.   And this whole post makes me want to barf, and is the reason I live in the country and not where people can creep on my kids (or be up in my business in any way).  What OP said will never be right, was never funny, and is never - and I mean never - going to be repaired.  Possibly smoothed over, but never forgotten .  And to a neighbor no less, I can\u2019t even imagine.\n\nI feel bad if the words left their mouth before they had time to consider them, I have said some things I regret, but wow this is really bad.  I can\u2019t tell if OP is really a creep or not, but it sure sounds like it.  If not I would be over at my neighbors apologizing profusely and saying how much they didn\u2019t mean what they said.  Maybe leave a case of beer on their porch or something.  But they still won\u2019t ever forget it.", ">He honestly got pretty aggressive and told me that if I ever did a thing to upset her ever again I\u2019d deeply regret it.  \n...  \n>  \n>my wife thinks he was majorly overreacting by dishing out threats to me in my own house.", "Additionally, IMO having a bit of grace for peoples mistakes (while still setting firm boundaries) gives them the opportunity to learn and do better, which I think really is better for women.\n\nThat is NOT to condone actual abuse, but small mistakes and bad jokes, yes.", "Didn\u2019t say who don\u2019t? What?\n\nI didn\u2019t excuse it and didn\u2019t say it wasn\u2019t creepy. He made one mistake, immediately recognized it, and tried to apologize. Accountability is different than perfection.", "He didn\u2019t GO INTO \u2014 he met at the door\n\nAnd his wife got OP\u2019s version"]}
