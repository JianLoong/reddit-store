Over the years I\u2019ve got friendly with the guy who lives next door (I\u2019ll call him John) - we say hi whenever we see each other, we go for beers sometimes and our kids go to the same school.\n\nI can see John\u2019s garden from my upstairs window, and last Saturday John\u2019s daughter (who is 19 and I\u2019ll call Casey for this) was out there sunbathing and listening to some music. Now I get on pretty well with Casey and with John\u2019s other two kids - we\u2019re obviously not best friends, but whenever I see them (like with John) I say hi and we chat for a moment. \n\nHere\u2019s the problem - I wanted to say hi and at that particular moment Casey was putting some sunscreen on her arms, and so I jokingly shouted from my window;\n\n\u201cHi Casey! You missed a spot!\u201d\n\nTo my horror she looked up at me like I\u2019d just slapped her across the face, and got up and left the garden. A couple minutes later I get a very, very pissed off John at my door yelling at me for upsetting his daughter. I felt pretty bad (like a total creep honestly), and tried to explain that I\u2019d only been joking around and that I\u2019d never meant to make Casey feel weird, but John wouldn\u2019t listen to me. He honestly got pretty aggressive and told me that if I ever did a thing to upset her ever again I\u2019d deeply regret it.\n\nMy wife was out at the time, but when she came back and I explained the situation she was on my side and furious at John for threatening me.\n\nI totally accept that I upset Casey, which I\u2019m really sorry for and never meant to do. But I\u2019m not too happy with what John did either, and my wife thinks he was majorly overreacting by dishing out threats to me in my own house. \n\nI think I was stupid, but do you guys think I was the asshole?\n\n\nEDIT: In response to some commenters - when I said \u201cYou missed a spot\u201d it\u2019s not that I\u2019d just been looking at her long enough to determine where she hadn\u2019t put cream and that\u2019s why I said it. I just said it generally as a joke towards someone putting on sunscreen.

The fact that your wife has your back also should solidify that you are NTA as it was a mere joke. John though totally overreacted and is definitely the AH here. He should\u2019ve came and talked to you reasonably and then acted on what your intentions were. End of story.", "YTA - You, probably unintentionally, came off as very creepy.

YTA", "YTA.  Even if you had a good relationship where joking is common, that comment from a window puts you in the creep category.", "YTA. I know it wasn't intentional, but it can be seen as an adult male spying on a teenager. I see why her father freaked out. There are a lot of predators out there.", "YTA \n\nYou were watching her from an upstairs window and then commented so that she knew you were watching. I can understand why she felt creeped out and I actually don\u2019t think her dads response was out of line", "ESH.  You were so wrong to invade her privacy like that as she had reasonable reason to believe she was sunbathing in private although obviously your upstairs window overhangs their backyard.  Whatever, you had a lapse in judgement there and she clearly felt like you were being a peeping tom.  As for her father's reaction, that was a bit over the top too and unfortunate.  Perhaps if you'd known Casey better it wouldn't have mattered so much, but obviously that is not the way she saw it.  Sorry.  Maybe when the heat of the moment is past, you can speak again to your neighbor about what happened and how your intentions were not meant to be lewd but rather in jest.  Whatever, you invaded her privacy and went where you were not welcome.", "Look, soft yta +ESH.\nYou seem to be a decent dude and I can tell you didn't mean to be a creep but honestly you were kind of a creep... The thing with yards especially if they're fenced in is people feel that they should have a reasonable amount of privacy within them. I know you can see over this fence, but it's still a boundary. It sounds like you had a foot-in-mouth moment, her dad is right to be pissed off that you were a creep, even if it was unintentional. Threatening you may be a bit much, but for all you know she misheard you and thought you said \"you look hot\" or \"I tell you what!\" \"Id kiss that spot\" Ect. That's the thing about shouting out windows, you can easily miss facial cues and the finer point in phrases.\n\nYou need to wait until things calm down and then find a time where you can apologize to Casey, wholeheartedly and earnestly, and explain to her that you didn't mean to make her feel uncomfortable. Own that you shouldn't have been looking at her, and it was inappropriate for you to comment on her in this situation at all. Remember you are an adult male and are very powerful in a teen girl's eyes, any comment that you make directly or indirectly about her body feels threatening. That's just the world we live in.\n\nIt seems like you and John are pretty good friends and those are hard to come by in grown men so I would certainly say do your very best to not implode this friendship.", "Yta. You just know your neighbor. You are not friends with him let alone his daughter. If you knew the daughter grond when she was little and have a like good relationship what het than you could make that comment. But in this situation absolutely not.

So yeah big AH move.", "I am not going to make any assumptions re what you were doing at the window, how long you were standing there or why you felt the need to make sure she knew it.\n\nThat being said.

Honestly, I just chalk this up to a lapse in self-awareness. She didn't know she was being watched and that startled her. As a young woman, to contemplate how long my middle aged neighbor has been watching me apply suntan lotion...even if you didn't mean it to be, that is unsettling. Your neighbor is just doing the best he can by protecting his young daughter at all costs. I don't think there are \"sides\" to this, I think that you can do your best to be apologetic and earnest and hope that your neighbor friend sees that and understands.

But you apparently have been watching her invisibly from a window long enough to see that she has not rubbed cream on every inch of her body. So you shout at her that she has missed a spot. She jumps a mile! How long have you been watching? Do you always watch her sunbathing?  Have you watched her throughout her suncream application? Are you getting off on it? Why are you watching? Or commenting?  \n\nCan you see it yet?\n\nOf course YTA, women don't want or need comments like this. Why do some men feel it is their right to comment directly or indirectly on a woman's appearance? At 19 she probably gets more than her share of  sleezy behaviour and is probably on high alert for it. Good on her dad for sticking up for her.", "YTA and a creep.

You understand that what you said could be interpreted to suggest you'd been watching her in a creepy way and yet..... you're not sorry? Whether you meant to sound like a creep or not is irrelevant, you did sound like a creep.

After #MeToo and all that went along with it over the last few years: you had to be out of your F'ing mind to do what you did!

Adults & kids don't have the same separation that they used to. None of my kids friends call adults Mr/Mrs. When I coached my kids teams, I had to repeatedly ask to be called coach or Mr Lastname. Adults even dress more like kids now. But, adult men interacting with teen girls has not changed; there are still creeps and many seem nice in the outside. I'll 100% stand up for you on how easy it was to forget for a moment, but you've got to realize that you f-ed up big time. \nThe real screw up was not owning your mistake. By standing your ground, you're literally saying that you want to defend your right to watch the neighbor girl and make comments about her appearance while she's not wearing much. You've dug a hole far deeper by trying to defend yourself. \nGo apologize for literally everything you did. Yes, no physical harm done and you had no ill intent. But you're old enough to know better. The harm was the shock to the girl. There's a good chance that she's not going to feel safe now in ways she felt safe before. It's a misunderstanding gone wild, but you created it.", "YTA. The main thing here is she was in her own garden, and you were looking at her from your own upstairs window. If she's in her garden she wants some sort of privacy, so you really shouldnt talk to her if shes sunbathing too. If you were gonna talk to her, you should have just said something else first instead of your joke, atleast just say 'Hi Casey' so she knows you're there and that you're not just being a creep.", "YTA.", "YTA\n\nI\u2019m not even sure why you\u2019re engaging in conversation with his kids. Stay away dude. Understand you\u2019re middle-aged now and adjust your behaviour.", "NAH. You weren't watching her or staring at her for a long period time and didn't intend to make her upset, but at the same time Casey has a right to feel upset by this because she's a young girl and you're an older man. Casey's father also isn't in the wrong because he likely wants to keep his daughter from harm. I think it'd be best to either try and apologize to Casey in-person, or if you feel like that would make it worse, just leave it be.", "YTA and a creep.  Saw her in the garden, should have just looked away.  You were looking at her.", "Clearly u two don\u2019t have that kind of friendly relationship", "YTA but unintentionally. Yes it was creepy but the fact that you acknowledge that you feel bad about it seems to indicate you didn't have bad intentions. It was very poor judgment though and I'll bet you won't make the same kind of mistake in the future.", "That is so creepy. YTA. If you yelled at my teenager daughter sunbathing in our yard, from your second floor, I would have reacted the same way.", "Yeesh. If you don't know how creepy that sounds...YTA and if you were my neighbor I'd be installing a fence so high you'd never be able to see into my yard.  IMO, your only option when you saw her was to turn away and move on with your day.", "NTA", "Nta neighbor overreacted", "It's just a comment and wasn't meant to hurt anyone and when you're comfortable with ppl you don't guard your speech. You apologized. I'd leave it at that. Now you probably won't talk anymore. Oh well", ">The action I took that should be judged is what I said to Casey\n\nnaw, naw, he specificaly said: \"The action I took that should be judged is what I said to Casey\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nso what he SAID.   \n\n\n  \n/s", "He didn\u2019t say he was watching her, it\u2019s a very feeble joke - kind of like seeing a couple going by on a tandem bike and yelling out to the one in front that the one in back isn\u2019t pedaling!\n\nIf he had been watching her that\u2019s incredibly creepy but he doesn\u2019t sound like he was - he just came out with an old, unfunny joke that made him *sound* like a creep. He doesn\u2019t come across as if he *is* a creep.", "Exactly. It\u2019s a pretty standard social rule that when someone is doing something in the privacy of their own backyard, especially something kind of vulnerable, you don\u2019t acknowledge it. She\u2019s never going to feel safe tanning in her yard again.\n\nBut I disagree that John overreacted.", "John absolutely didnt overreact, OP is an AH and clearly gets the message now, maybe next time he wont creep on his neighbors daughter", "THIS. People need to think about how stuff like this looks to the person being shouted at. She has no idea he wasn\u2019t staring at her the whole time. Of course they\u2019re pissed.", "I think because I\u2019m older a lot of people are missing that this used to be a *standard* feeble joke people would use. These days it\u2019s understood as creepy but in no way does it mean he was *actually* watching her. He just trotted out the old joke without thinking about how times have changed and that it would now be read as creepy.", "If he really felt bad and saw how creepy this is, he wouldn\u2019t be on a subreddit asking if he\u2019s an asshole.", "If he knew he was wrong he wouldn\u2019t be posting to Reddit for sympathy", "If he gets it, then why is he posting here?", "Maybe of people of equal standing.  Not a middle age dude to a teenage girl, one dressed the other less (not like they both at pool doing same thing) from a distance without the target knowing, so not even in passing.  Maybe it was different before the 90s but in the 90s we considered that flirting", "I\u2019m older too and I think people are missing that this used to be a *standard* feeble joke. I spend a lot of time trying to tell my 70 year old husband that no, we\u2019re not allowed to say things like that any more, people might think you had *actually* been watching her. \n\nIt still comes across as creepy these days but I think it\u2019s more changing times.", "Exactly. He\u2019d be here asking for advice about how to put this right.", "He's not like a regular neighbour, he's a *cool* neighbour"]}
