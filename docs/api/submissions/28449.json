Why should she back away from someone who is clearly in a bad relationship and mental place and needs help?", ">Child services doesn\u2019t remove children because one parent is an addict.\n\nBut that's not all that's going on here. If the truth came out that she knew he was \"faking\" his drug tests (which, same as you, I don't know how that's possible just by not taking drugs the day before the test, shouldn't they stay in the body for a fair amount of time?), then child services is likely to see that as her not having the child's best interest at heart and will put her addict partner above an innocent child. Cuz why would child services trust her with a baby if she's not being honest about a terrible situation. It'd be like if one parent knew the other was abusive toward their child and didn't do anything about it-in that case, you can't trust *either* parent.", "I agree, OP seems to genuinely care about both SD and baby. SD is in an awful situation and OP is right, they very well could take the baby.\n\nOP, is there anything you can do to try ro get SD and baby away from baby daddy? You don't need to answer me of course, just think about all your possible options. Baby daddy is already abusive.\n\nNTA OP and I hope everything works out", "Unless she's a really young stepmother, she's going to be one of those grandmothers who sacrifices her retirement to raise someone else's kid. And a mentally unstable mother is not going to be any help. If OP is right and stepdaughter is dysfunctional enough to have her newborn taken into care, then the full burden will fall on OP.", "And that is OP's decision to make. There is nothing saying that OP *has* to take the baby, but if that's something she wants to / is willing to do until SD gets her feet under her, it's her decision", "If you read other posts, she is a really young stepmother (35). There is already bad history between her and the stepdaughter though, so taking the baby will likely just invite more drama.", "YTA for your attitude.  You come across very judgemental and like you're trying to act like a lawyer without being one.  You should refer SD to a lawyer.", "No you are not. You told the truth when asked a question,the truth may not help your daughter. But the most important thing that can be done is protecting that baby.", "no, helpful information good", "I work closely with children\u2019s services and I\u2019ve seen them remove a child for less than one parent being a drug addict. She doesn\u2019t live with us and hasn\u2019t since she met him. her and her boyfriend bounce around rented rooms and seem to live someone new every month. That in itself is a concern for the social worker as she has already told me and my husband that. There are other concerns but she wouldn\u2019t go into detail on the phone. \n\nI don\u2019t know what drugs he is on or how they test him, I only know what she has told us until we go to the meeting with the social worker. She wouldn\u2019t go into massive amounts of detail on the phone and said she would go through everything when we meet her.", "GHB, for one. I'm sure there are others with very short blood half-lives, too. Addiction doesn't require physical dependency.\n\nIn any case, that part of the story sounded implausible to me, too. If he has serious drug problems it's unlikely he limits himself to a few specific drugs and is able to manage the timing so precisely. He's probably failing drug tests regularly, if he's being required to take them.", "Exactly what I was thinking.  I'm not sure what sort of drug test are being done but many drugs stay in your system for days.  You may not be affected by them but you are still excreting their metabolites and a supervised urine test is going to pick them up."]}
