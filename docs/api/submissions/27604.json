The process came to a halt when they learned Rosie would need to talk to a court appointed therapist, and possibly a judge, so they could decide whether Rosie wanted it or the adoption was being forced.

My sister lost it with Rosie and dragged her home and punished her. But not Agnes. My mom did go over and tell Agnes how wrong she was though. Which upset my sister and her husband.\n\nMy sister then told me that she wanted to do better by Agnes and she needed to do better for her and get things fixed with her and Rosie. I corrected her and said she should be trying to make things better for both and that means not letting Agnes say or do whatever she likes because she agrees with her.

If she's not being active directly with Rosie she should start. That doesn't really change how OP's sister is likely to react to more forceful feedback.
