{"id": 10719, "submission_id": "11a3kdy", "title": "AITA For Not Giving my Girlfriend Money For Nothing?", "selftext": "This whole story has been a drawn out event, and it needs some context. So I (31M) have been working in the business sector for a little over 7 years. It\u2019s been paying very well, as my field (MIS/Logistics) has been growing steadily for a while now. I\u2019ve been very particular about my finances ever since I was a teenager; I\u2019ve always made sure to save and invest intelligently. \n\nA little over a year ago, I met my girlfriend. We\u2019ll call her Sarah. Now Sarah (29F) is an incredible person. She\u2019s been supportive and kind and loving throughout our entire relationship, and I\u2019ve tried my hardest to return that same energy. But she had a really large issue come up in her field last month. She works in physical therapy, and her company laid her off last month. She hasn\u2019t been smart with her money at all. I\u2019ve tried to tell her to invest but she still only put away about 10% of her income, and she made a big investment in herself last year moving into the city, so her financial situation isn\u2019t great. She only has a couple thousand saved up, and she had to move out of her apartment when she got laid off due to it\u2019s ridiculous rent (1500$ a month). \n\nShe asked me if she could move in for a bit to get back on her feet, and I begrudgingly obliged. My apartment isn\u2019t massive, and it\u2019s way more expensive getting food for two every night. Now it\u2019s been over two weeks; and she still doesn\u2019t have a job. She\u2019s had a couple interviews, but they\u2019ve fallen through. I asked her about when she thinks she\u2019ll get another job, and she says it\u2019ll probably take a bit. \n\nI feel like she\u2019s taking advantage of me. To top it all off, she asked yesterday if she could borrow 100 bucks to pay off her credit card bills from earlier in the month. I told her that I\u2019m done giving her money for free, and that she needs to get a job a soon, because it\u2019s costing me so much keeping her in and feeding her. She started crying and said that she couldn\u2019t believe how I was acting after how long we\u2019ve been together. My friends think I\u2019m being too harsh on her. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I know 100 bucks isn\u2019t that much money, but it\u2019s the principle of asking me to pay off her own payments that irks me. She made those purchases, she should be responsible for them.", "created_utc": 1677173820, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11a3kdy/aita_for_not_giving_my_girlfriend_money_for/", "score": 116, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Who says she made irresponsible purchases? That credit card bill may be transactions that she expected to be able to cover with her salary. Also your \"money for nothing\" attitude is really shitty. You said yourself that she has been amazingly supportive of you for a year. You can be supportive of her for more two weeks. The money isn't for \"nothing\", it's for HER, to protect her credit score. If it plunges while she has no housing, she will have a terrible time getting any landlord to accept her application. She is right to prioritize protecting her credit report right now, so she doesn't wind up homeless. She is in a tough situation, and instead of being a supportive partner to her you are making the situation more stressful than necessary. If you have no reason to expect that she won't repay you when she's employed again, find more grace in your heart than the little you've mustered so far. She's in a scary spot, and needs your compassion not your resentment and snide remarks.", "YTA.\nIt's been only two weeks, calm down.\nShe literally got laid off, it's not her fault.

I paid for everything - rent, bills, groceries. And I guarantee I was making less than you do (think below $40,000 per year).\n\nShe was unemployed for literal years while attending school. Our relationship was pretty much on the rocks at this point, and the financial issues were just the straw that broke the camel's back.\n\nBut I still waited for her to finish her schooling and get her degree before breaking up with her. Gave no ultimatums about when she needed to be out of the apartment by. We'd been together nearly a decade. Did the best I could given the breakup that NEEDED to happen, and I still felt like an asshole for having to do it.\n\nSo yeah. YTA. Cuz your situation is so much more egregious.", "YTA . Listening to the way you describe the situation, it's obvious you do not have a high opinion of her. She sounds like a nice girl who is down on her luck, and you're kicking her when she's down.

GFs come and go and must \"work\" (pun?) hard at that wife title. With that said, imo, you story a wife not a GF. NTA in my opinion, even knowing her situation ahead of time (her wreck less ways). Women want to act strong and independent but in times like this, from reading your writing, appears she's getting \"comfy.\" You're not comfy with it to the point it doesn't read like she's got wife potential. Sure opposite attract but this is way too opposite; 1 responsible with money, 1 that is not. Your back will forever hurt from carrying this broad. To be it reads as she's gonna play this out so continue to press her on the job search. This will either motivate her to shut you up but more importantly find work cause making our own money is better than relying on someone constantly on you to get a job.

She didn't even have the common decency to ask for a loan. She wanted you to straight up just fork over cash to her. This is how to make yourself poor real fast.

(I'm also skeptical that his GF had to give up her apartment and move in within this time frame - how did she make the decision, hire a moving company, and complete the move within a week, and how was breaking her lease the cheapest option right away instead of giving herself a bit more time to find work?).\n\n\nOf course it could just be that he lives in his own little rarefied world and has very few realistic expectations of people, but this feels like someone who's just guessing at numbers that would entail high rent, low savings, a reasonable amount of time to find a job/move apartments, etc. If this is somehow, sadly real, at best OP is miserable at communicating and is a jerk for \"begrudgingly\" letting his girlfriend move in and resenting the amount of money spent on food (sounds like he's getting takeout every night - an incredibly unwise spending habit).", "YTA.

So I (31M) have been working in the business sector for a little over 7 years. It\u2019s been paying very well, as my field (MIS/Logistics) has been growing steadily for a while now. I\u2019ve been very particular about my finances ever since I was a teenager; I\u2019ve always made sure to save and invest intelligently. A little over a year ago, I met my girlfriend. We\u2019ll call her Sarah. Now Sarah (29F) is an incredible person. She\u2019s been supportive and kind and loving throughout our entire relationship, and I\u2019ve tried my hardest to return that same energy. But she had a really large issue come up in her field last month. She works in physical therapy, and her company laid her off last month. She hasn\u2019t been smart with her money at all. I\u2019ve tried to tell her to invest but she still only put away about 10% of her income, and she made a big investment in herself last year moving into the city, so her financial situation isn\u2019t great. She only has a couple thousand saved up, and she had to move out of her apartment when she got laid off due to it\u2019s ridiculous rent (1500$ a month). She asked me if she could move in for a bit to get back on her feet, and I begrudgingly obliged. My apartment isn\u2019t massive, and it\u2019s way more expensive getting food for two every night. Now it\u2019s been over two weeks; and she still doesn\u2019t have a job. She\u2019s had a couple interviews, but they\u2019ve fallen through. I asked her about when she thinks she\u2019ll get another job, and she says it\u2019ll probably take a bit. I feel like she\u2019s taking advantage of me. To top it all off, she asked yesterday if she could borrow 100 bucks to pay off her credit card bills from earlier in the month. I told her that I\u2019m done giving her money for free, and that she needs to get a job a soon, because it\u2019s costing me so much keeping her in and feeding her. She started crying and said that she couldn\u2019t believe how I was acting after how long we\u2019ve been together. My friends think I\u2019m being too harsh on her. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/AmItheAsshole) if you have any questions or concerns.*", "YTA.  It takes way longer than 2 weeks for someone to find a job.   And if you see any future in her $100 is literally nothing especially if you are successful like you say you are.  If you are not spending on your significant other when they are struggling what\u2019s the point of saving all that money.  It wasn\u2019t for nothing $100 for credit card bill is valid.  Because if she misses it, it will lower her credit score quite a bit, and it\u2019s hard to recover from that.  Late payments can drop your credit score up to or more than 50 points", "YTA. The physical therapy jobs are out there, but a person doesn\u2019t want to take just anything, because, well, there\u2019s a lot of toxic healthcare jobs out there and PT pay varies wildly depending on the setting and your experience. She has been out of work for 3 weeks, and IT IS sad she is having to borrow only three weeks out, but she has been responsible with dumping the crazy expensive apartment and recognizing that she had to downsize. I have a feeling she will be downsizing further based on your behavior over two weeks of cohabitation and some food and bill money.", "YTA\n\nYou lack any empathy or understanding.  Obviously GF is going through a tough time.  3 weeks is not a lot of time to find a new job.  She\u2019s not asking for an open credit line- it was a specific and small request.  Yes are absolutely able to decline.  But given your lack of care or compassion, don\u2019t expect this relationship to last.", "NAH. You've been together a year, that's really not a long time. She's a PT, she can easily find a job so it seems like she's choosing not to try very hard.", "Wow. YTA. A massive one. Two weeks and you are complaining. Borrowing $100 and you are complaining. Your choice of words in the title shows how manipulative you are. She asked to borrow, not for you to give money to her.

The 10% savings is on her but people make mistakes and when it's someone you love and their chips are down, you need to get off your high horse and help out.

If not, you shouldn't have let her move in.", "She asked for help - how is that taking advantage of you?\n\nThe money on her CC is already spent. Unless she can return things, you're just beating her over the nose talking about her spending habits WHEN SHE HAD A JOB.

She's obviously looking if she's been interviewing.\n\nI wish I could write to her and tell her to DUMP YOUR ASS.

It's controlling, hostile, and lacks any grace whatsoever towards this woman you say is supportive, kind, and loving. \n\nShe asked for help, and you're kicking her while she's down. Two weeks is nothing in a job search, and you'd know that if you took the time to show any curiosity about her field. \n\nYou're not ready for a partnership and won't be until you're also capable of wanting to be supportive, kind, and loving. That's really unfair to her.", "NTA. She\u2019s your girlfriend, not your wife. This is the perfect time to get a job, so if she isn\u2019t finding one it\u2019s because she isn\u2019t working.

He respected her until she lost her job through not fault of her own. Maybe OP is truly ignoring the fact that she did not ever had more than 10% of her income to shelve away all the time. She still has to live too and be happy and sometimes that takes money to do it. It is like that old school boomer argument that if millennials were not spending money buying avocados for their toast , they could afford a down payment on a home. This same attitude is reflected in OP's post about how she could have avoided this if she was not laid off, without a job for a few weeks and struggling to find employment. *If she just saved more than 10% and invested like me, she would have not dealt with this issue where my hard earned money would not go to her.
