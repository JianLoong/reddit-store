He works with a lot of kids and tries to look out for them, be a mentor, etc. He's a dad x5, so he genuinely cares about them having good futures.\n\n*let me preface the rest of this by saying I do not suspect him of any suspicious behavior with a minor in any way*\n\nThere is one girl (16f) there who had started messaging him on FB, and it was really frequently and about personal things, not work. Her mom then added him on FB.. and then even her on/off boyfriend did.\n\nFor weeks, she had been messaging him at all hours of the day/night and then started asking if he could pick her up for work.\n\nI put my foot down here. I said absolutely not. He's not a taxi service, and he's not going to be alone in a car with a female minor he's not related to. He wouldn't even be able to have someone else in the car with them as a witness/buffer because we have 2 kids still in carseats, so no one can sit in the back seats.\n\nI told him I was getting uncomfortable with how much they talk outside of work. I received a text message from an unknown number about how I needed to look into how close he was getting with a minor he worked with. I told him that no matter how innocent he is, if someone even hints at him not being innocent, his life could suffer ramifications from it.\n\nA little time goes by, and I notice the messages have slowed down some but not enough. I tell him he needs to figure this situation out because I'm not going to stand for it much longer. \n\nI find out that we, as a family, are invited to this girls birthday party - per her mom and her.\n\nI tell him at this point I'm getting creeped out. I've never met this girl or her mom. Never laid eyes on either of them. They don't know me or our kids. Why would we be invited to this party? He said it's because he talks about us so much that she feels like she knows us.\n\nI said, hard no. This is hitting major weird vibes. This is lifetime movie - coworker gets rid of dude's girlfriend to take her place vibes. Or coworker gets rid of dude because he's unattainable.\n\nHe thinks I'm over reacting, he had tried to assure me that she's just a sweet kid, etc.\n\nSo he told me that since it's causing issues between us, he'll block her, unfriend her, her mom, and her current boyfriend on FB, and tell her the friendship has to end.\n\nSo tonight, he comes home and says, \"You have a gift, it's not from me. I didn't know she was going to do it, but even after I told her we can't be friends, she insisted I give it to you. She said she's going to get a different job since she's causing us issues.\"\n\nThere was a small bunch of fake flowers, and a Mother's Day card that just said Love, Coworker on the inside.\n\nI'm so creeped out. I really don't feel like I'm over reacting but I told him I would ask the internet, so that's what I'm doing.

He never should have got into texting about personal things and needs to do better at setting boundaries. If he was a teacher and she was a student this would be a huuuuge problem. A boss and a subordinate is not so different when working with 16 year olds.\n\nThe fact that he couldn\u2019t end the friendship without blaming you seems really off to me.", "NTA\n\nYour concerns are valid, yes. What he does is highly commendable. Way too many employers and managers would exploit their younger workers, rather than actively support them.\n\nThat being said, he is putting himself in a very vulnerable position. All it can take is one unscrupulous individual, or family, looking for a payday to completely destroy his life.\n\nThat is why it is important when dealing with minors to set certain boundaries that safeguard everyone involved. Things like never being alone with them, especially outside of work. The car thing is a definite no-no. The frequent messaging outside of work can be considered crossing a line. One can still be supportive with lines like these in place. It is recommended to consider this with anyone who works for you, but with minors it really should be standard.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t take into account how some people can easily become fixated on someone who shows them a little kindness. It can be misconstrued for something else other than simple decency. No malicious intent on either side, but a simple misunderstanding. More likely with younger people who haven\u2019t got the bedrock of experience to measure the other\u2019s actions against, nor the full sense of their own identity and self-worth. They can latch on to someone who seems to increase their self-worth, and it can be unhealthy.\n\nTLDR - Your concerns are valid. There may well be nothing untoward there, or there might. Either way he needs to set some boundaries to look after himself and his vulnerable workers.", "NTA\n\nSomeone took the time to message you about their relationship because they found it unprofessional, that should be enough of a wake up call to your husband that this kid isn't his daughters and to stop playing parent to her. This could ruin his reputation and work opportunity. Horrible accusations have a way of sticking, even untrue ones. It's not worth the risk to your family and his real x5 kids, if he get accused of something terrible (true or untrue people talk). \n\nAlso sending your bosses gf a gift , when she has told you she finds your behaviour inappropriate is super weird. She isn't respecting the boundaries put in place. \n\nAs the manager your boyfriend can schedule their shifts so reduce interaction, I would request he does this until her notice period is done. He shouldn't be alone with her whilst they both dont respect your boundaries. He shouldn't have ever accepted the gift, he should have shut that down and told you about it when he got home.", "NTA. Just the insinuation of inappropriate behavior can cost him his job or even worse. All these communications with a minor may be legal but others may make their own judgements that can affect his life.", "NTA \nas someone below said, someone took the time to message you about how shady it appears. that\u2019s all that matters. Even if you were ok with it, if the girls mom was ok with it, etc. at least one person is seeing what is going on and is questioning. Sadly, that\u2019s all it takes. it doesn\u2019t matter that he sees himself as a father figure, he can be a father figure strictly at work without all of the excessive outside contact. the gift to you is creepy tho, and being invited to the birthday party is a whole other level of odd that shouldn\u2019t be touched with a ten foot pole.", "NTA and i don't think he's that innocent.. why is he friends with a minor, why talk so much outside of work about her personal issues? i highly doubt he's such good friends with other minors, especially boys, that work at his place. everything is very suspicious, especially since it took him so long to finally give in to your requests of cutting contact with her. this is too suspicious...", "NTA. There is mentoring and then there is crossing a line. Being a sounding board for minor employees or providing advice when asked is one thing. Giving rides to work, going to birthday parties, having parents and BFs of the parent friend you- that\u2019s crossing the line.", "No.  This is creepy and it's such a lapse in good judgement that your boyfriend can't see this.  Consider if someone with judgment this piss poor is someone you want to hitch your wagon to.", "NTA\n\nThough it feels like this kid sees him as a sorta dad figure.", "Wtf did she see him as? Some sort of weird work husband? She needs to stay in her lane. And your husband seems like a nice person so he probably didn\u2019t think much into messaging her. But he should\u2019ve never messaged her. Even throughout hours into the night. That\u2019s highly inappropriate. Maybe, better case scenario, he was like a work dad? It\u2019s still all so weird. Especially her saying \u201csorry for causing issues\u201d. ISSUES! What issues!? Besides worrying your husband could get in trouble for being a nice guy!", "NTA your instincts are correct. A 16 yr old girl shouldn\u2019t have a close friendship with the 35 yr old guy who manages her workplace. It\u2019s fine if they have a friendly dynamic at work or attend group activities together on rare occasion. Her doubling down on the boundaries by inviting you both to her party and getting you the gifts *is* weird.  If the whole pizza shop was attending the party, maybe, but it doesn\u2019t sound like case.\n\nEven if your bf is 100% appropriate and never once crosses the line, a simple unfounded rumor could ruin his reputation. At worst it can ruin his life. This is a hill worth dying on in your relationship. Pay attention to this becoming a pattern with other employees in the future.", ">  let me preface the rest of this by saying I do not suspect him of any suspicious behavior with a minor in any way\n\nThe first half sounds like you do to be honest. Or like you go out of the way to not suspecting just so you don't. As of birthday party, would he be the only person from work there or would it be the whole team? Who is the anonymous person and what are relationships on that workplace like?\n\nYou are very afraid of your husband's life being destroyed by false accusation ... but is that actually the only thing to be worried about here? Because it is very clear that he is not making the boundary between you and employee clear. If he is supposed to be mentor, I would expect the mentor to say something like \"Andrea, giving mothers days gifts to my wife is not appropriate. You don't know her and she stated clearly she is not interested in relationship with my employeees\".", "Well if she creeped you out so much you did the right thing telling him to stop talking to her. So NTA. But I have to admit that I don't think she had bad intentions. If she was in love or something with your husband then I don't think that she would tell her mom or bf an then they would follow you on FB. Probably because he is nice to everyone and he cares she felt safe with him. I don't know if there is a father in the picture or maybe some problems with her life but I really really don't believe she is bad. Okay it's a little weird that she texted him at all times but it seems to me that she trusted him so much and felt safe with him to talk to him for something else except work. And the gift is probably because he talks to much about you and says kind words that she felt that a gift would make you Happy or even initiated this so maybe you can come closer.", "NAH. You and the kids are invited because inviting JUST him would creep you out even more", "I\u2019m getting some serious Lolita vibes from reading this, so NTA OP.", "NAH. I have what I would call \"Work parents\". I've had some issues as a young adult. Holy fucking hell am I greatful for my coworker and previous boss who genuinely cared for my wellbeing. I still have semi-regular meetings with said coworker where I have time to vent about personal issues, relationships and general young people problems.\n\nWhat the difference is tho: I am male and over 18. Coworker is female in late-40s.\n\nBF takes pride in helping/guiding young people in life, which is absolutely fantastic.\n\nBut society will always be judgemental, and sadly/rightfully so, of men. So BF should set more boundaries and have better judgement.", "NTA.", "NTA, you might be over reacting, but I don\u2019t think so. but this really sounds sketchy as hell. Either she is crushing on him and wants to become his gf, or they are working together to set him up and blackmail him.", "Depends...\n\nINFO: does your huband talk about her at all to you? You say the kid feels like she knows you, but does your husband help you understand why he spends so much time talking to this girl? He might really be just a father figure in her life at a point when it's important for her to have one, and maybe her mom just understands that.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
