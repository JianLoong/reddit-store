I don\u2019t know her that well but she\u2019s been super nice every time we\u2019ve met. \n\nMy aunt and uncle seem to like her despite the outdated views common among their age group. It\u2019s my mother that\u2019s a problem. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s wife Sarah is currently 6 months pregnant and she\u2019s quite huge for a lack of better terms. She\u2019s clearly having trouble walking around for too long and gets tired very quickly. \n\nAnyways, my aunt invited the whole extended family to dinner and unsurprisingly all the young women were put to work while the men sat on their asses. My aunt was kind enough to tell Sarah to sit down but my mother started making passive aggressive comments in our language calling her lazy and dramatic. She also said that her mother in law still made her work when she was pregnant. Sarah understands bits and pieces of the language so I think she could tell my mom wasn\u2019t saying very nice things about her and I felt incredibly embarrassed. \n\nBut thankfully my cousin, Sarah\u2019s husband, intervened and politely told my mom to mind her own before taking Sarah to a different room so she could rest. The second they were out of earshot she started gossiping about how it\u2019s a shame my aunt\u2019s only son married a \u201cforeigner.\u201d She and my other aunts then talked about how tough it must be for my \u201ccrazy handsome\u201d cousin and how he should\u2019ve married this one very pretty girl from back home. My cousin\u2019s mother looked ashamed and didn\u2019t bother interrupting them. \n\nI just went fuck this really loudly before asking them if they aren\u2019t embarrassed shit talking a pregnant woman. My mom said so what if she\u2019s pregnant, she\u2019s not royalty and \u201dmy in laws were much stricter if she can\u2019t handle this much she shouldn\u2019t have married into our precious family\u201d to which I replied with \u201cPrecious family? Seriously? This family is actually trashy as hell and the main reason is you and your weird complex about a happy couple that has nothing to do with you.\u201d \n\nMy mom called me a brat with a nasty mouth before storming off. One of my aunts later told me that they found her crying in the backyard. That made me a little sad, I was quite harsh and knowing what the culture is like, I probably should\u2019ve watched myself a bit. She is my mom after all and I did yell at her in front of all these other women. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701854832, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c0afo/aita_for_being_bratty_and_nasty_to_my_mom/", "score": 22, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because people were nasty to your mother and made her work hard despite the fact that she was pregnant, she thinks she has the right to be nasty to the younger women in her family, who are in that situation. I will go NTA for you, but I encourage you to try and make your mother see these patterns too, so that she may change her ways instead of being at the receiving end of verbal abuse all her life through. Of course if she persists, then that is on her, and she shouldn't expect you to condone her conduct.", "NTA your mom is the one being nasty, rude, racist, and just awful.", "NTA Good for you! Your mother was being ugly by a bullying a pregnant family member. She needed to be called out for her shameful behavior. You\u2019re a hero in my book.", "NTA- Your mother was being nasty and you told her so. She sounds jealous that your aunt is a better MIL than your grandmother. \n\nIf anything, this is something you should consider when finding your own partner. Prepare to go on the defensive if the person you love isn\u2019t of the same culture. This could also be seen as a positive since now your mother knows how you feel about her prejudice.", "Your mom was out of line so I can understand your response.  \n\nI wonder if she could talk some of this out  civilly and, like, update her views a little bit on how cultural outsiders should be treated, or if she\u2019ll always be this way?

It's 2023, I don't care what your cultural background is, love is love and people can marry who they want.  Older people bitching about it can and should be told to stfu and called out for their bigotry.  Now your mother and all the other women of the family know they're going to get their asses handed to them if they try this shit in front of you again."]}
