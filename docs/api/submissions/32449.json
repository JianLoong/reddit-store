I don\u2019t know her that well but she\u2019s been super nice every time we\u2019ve met. \n\nMy aunt and uncle seem to like her despite the outdated views common among their age group. It\u2019s my mother that\u2019s a problem. \n\nMy cousin\u2019s wife Sarah is currently 6 months pregnant and she\u2019s quite huge for a lack of better terms. She\u2019s clearly having trouble walking around for too long and gets tired very quickly. \n\nAnyways, my aunt invited the whole extended family to dinner and unsurprisingly all the young women were put to work while the men sat on their asses. My aunt was kind enough to tell Sarah to sit down but my mother started making passive aggressive comments in our language calling her lazy and dramatic. She also said that her mother in law still made her work when she was pregnant. Sarah understands bits and pieces of the language so I think she could tell my mom wasn\u2019t saying very nice things about her and I felt incredibly embarrassed. \n\nBut thankfully my cousin, Sarah\u2019s husband, intervened and politely told my mom to mind her own before taking Sarah to a different room so she could rest. The second they were out of earshot she started gossiping about how it\u2019s a shame my aunt\u2019s only son married a \u201cforeigner.\u201d She and my other aunts then talked about how tough it must be for my \u201ccrazy handsome\u201d cousin and how he should\u2019ve married this one very pretty girl from back home. My cousin\u2019s mother looked ashamed and didn\u2019t bother interrupting them. \n\nI just went fuck this really loudly before asking them if they aren\u2019t embarrassed shit talking a pregnant woman. My mom said so what if she\u2019s pregnant, she\u2019s not royalty and \u201dmy in laws were much stricter if she can\u2019t handle this much she shouldn\u2019t have married into our precious family\u201d to which I replied with \u201cPrecious family? Seriously? This family is actually trashy as hell and the main reason is you and your weird complex about a happy couple that has nothing to do with you.\u201d \n\nMy mom called me a brat with a nasty mouth before storming off. One of my aunts later told me that they found her crying in the backyard. That made me a little sad, I was quite harsh and knowing what the culture is like, I probably should\u2019ve watched myself a bit. She is my mom after all and I did yell at her in front of all these other women. \n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1701854832, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18c0afo/aita_for_being_bratty_and_nasty_to_my_mom/", "score": 143, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Just because people were nasty to your mother and made her work hard despite the fact that she was pregnant, she thinks she has the right to be nasty to the younger women in her family, who are in that situation. I will go NTA for you, but I encourage you to try and make your mother see these patterns too, so that she may change her ways instead of being at the receiving end of verbal abuse all her life through. Of course if she persists, then that is on her, and she shouldn't expect you to condone her conduct.", "NTA your mom is the one being nasty, rude, racist, and just awful.", "NTA Good for you!

All because she supports a culture where it is acceptable to be toxic and abusive. \n\nIf making her cry is what it takes to shut her down. Do it.", "NTA, but you upset one. Nothing to worry about. Your mum had a fast intro to karma", "NTA, well done for standing up for this poor girl, your mother should be ashamed", "NTA.  This is how you respond to someone who is being a bully and a racist to boot.  Let's hope that in addition to crying in the backyard, your mother actually gave her terrible words toward and about your SIL some serious thought.", "NTA your mother is crying and sad because she raised a good child with good morals, uninterested in engaging in the racist stereotypes of yesteryear or falling in line with the nonsense that age alone demands respect.  It's 2023, I don't care what your cultural background is, love is love and people can marry who they want.  Older people bitching about it can and should be told to stfu and called out for their bigotry.  Now your mother and all the other women of the family know they're going to get their asses handed to them if they try this shit in front of you again.", "Well done for standing up for a totally innocent woman!!\n\nYou are probably one of the reasons that she is still with your cousin!! If it was me, I wouldn't even have married him as being accepted by in-laws are very important.\n\nObviously NTA. You rock \ud83e\udef5\ud83e\udd1f", "NTA OP. Your mom may have endured horrible things and this may be the impact of trauma on her. I come from a Western Asian culture that is very oppressive in terms of how much burden they place on women. Oftentimes, this results in a cycle of violence because the women who were once oppressed find release when it's their turn to do the same. They also don't really know any better. They reach an elevated status in the family when they become in-laws and grandparents. The DILs have to obey them to an extent so they do this type of shit. It's sad, your mother is a victim too. But you by doing what you did are breaking generational trauma. I would encourage you to have a kinder convo with your mother to understand and help her if you can as well.", "She was continuing the cycle of abuse, you stepped up and said that's not happening.

You aren't obligated to like every person in your family or who your family members chose to love. But you should have enough decency to be cordial and considerate ESPECIALLY if that person has never been anything but kind and respectful to you and yours. Also, she obviously had no problem bad mouthing *her* in front of all the other women, but when you confront her on it, suddenly *you* should be mindful of your surroundings? I think not.", "\"knowing what the culture is like\", you should continue to push back on this CRAP....\n\nNTA", "NTA, but it sounds like your female relatives all are.

Your mother was going very far overboard in her behavior and she really does know that she ought to be ashamed for her words.\n\nHowever, if you want to have a better script for the future... do you have a religious tradition? Or, more accurately, does your family? If so, you can very likely go to a religious advisor and ask their opinion on gossip and malicious speech. I can almost promise you that it will be negative, and the next time this starts up you can pull a pious act and ask everybody to refrain from backbiting because *you've* been struggling with this sin and you don't want to risk backsliding.\n\nThis is ridiculous, and I only suggest you do it because I get the feeling you're going to keep feeling bad for going after your mother like this even though she absolutely was asking for it, but it may work if you manage to not specifically call her or any other person out.", "god i hate hate HATE the argument \u201cmy parents / in-laws / guardians were SO much worse smh u guys can\u2019t handle anything!!!!1\u201d like okay??? im sorry you had to go through that but why tf are you trying to pass it down??????", "Can't take it but happy to dish it out\n\nYour mother should consider she's only feeling like this as you've held her accountable for being awful\nWhereas she's happily made someone else feel like this because they're from a different culture in public\n\nNah, you did fine.

I come from a south Asian culture where \u2018respecting\u2019 elders is deeply entrenched into core beliefs of children. And at events the men also sit on their arses while women are in the kitchen. So when elders are in the wrong it can (a) hard to establish they are wrong because I was programmed to believe they were always right, (b) be hard to speak up in the first place and (c) when I did speak up I felt deep shame and guilt that wasn\u2019t helped by elders ganging up on on me telling me I was in the wrong for speaking that way. I don\u2019t know if that is same in your culture and I may be projecting my own experiences here, but NOTHING justifies the rudeness and plain nastiness demonstrated here by your mum and aunties. Not being of a different culture- that is plain old racism. Not being a \u2018foreigner\u2019 - nothing. I commend you for speaking up. That was brave. Don\u2019t let them wear you down. You were right.", "NTA this racist bullshit needs to end", "Someone should have gotten your mom's in laws on the phone and say your precious DIL is bad mouthing how you treated her, for everyone to hear.
