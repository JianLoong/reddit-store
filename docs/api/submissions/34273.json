She onboarded with coworker 36M and they always got along. She left the company for a while and he helped her secure a full time position. Cool. \n\nI\u2019ve never really cared about their relationship because it\u2019s always been strictly work and not much else. However this last year they seem to have grown closer. They are not on the same team but constantly messaging, giving work advice, she\u2019s invited to his team lunches etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything going on outside of work but I think it\u2019s broaching inappropriate.\n\nDown to the issue, it\u2019s New Year Eve, he video chats her to take a shot for the New Year. They end the call saying see you, and they\u2019ll bring gifts next in office day.\n\nI ask my wife what she got him. She say she made him a shirt, which I do remember as I helped her just didn\u2019t ask who it was for. The shirt had text bubbles and on it said, \u201cWhose your favorite?\u201d \u201cMe, I\u2019m my own favorite.\u201d She said it was from a conversation they had.\n\nI tell her she\u2019s flirting. They\u2019re both flirting. It sends the wrong message, shows to much effort. She denies it and said they are friends and that she always home makes gifts(true). That all they do is complain about work together and it\u2019s nice to have someone in her corner. I tell her she can get him a Starbucks gift card them. \n\nShe thinks I\u2019m being a controlling AH. But I think it\u2019s seriously inappropriate. So AITA\n\nEdit: Not allow, wrong wording. She can do whatever she wants but me stating what I\u2019m uncomfortable with.\n\nEdit: My wife is flirting, I\u2019ve known her for 10plus years. That is not up for debate, I know how she flirts and I know that she\u2019s flirting. She doesn\u2019t do anything without intention. She kept her phone on her because she was expecting that call, this is someone who \u201chates\u201d video chats. Im not an idiot. I don\u2019t care about that, I care that giving a meaningful gift to someone you are already actively flirting with (innocent or not) crosses a line. All I was wondering is if im really the AH for explaining this to her, and saying hey you shouldn\u2019t do that.

She onboarded with coworker 36M and they always got along. She left the company for a while and he helped her secure a full time position. Cool. \n\nI\u2019ve never really cared about their relationship because it\u2019s always been strictly work and not much else. However this last year they seem to have grown closer. They are not on the same team but constantly messaging, giving work advice, she\u2019s invited to his team lunches etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything going on outside of work but I think it\u2019s broaching inappropriate.\n\nDown to the issue, it\u2019s New Year Eve, he video chats her to take a shot for the New Year. They end the call saying see you, and they\u2019ll bring gifts next in office day.\n\nI ask my wife what she got him. She say she made him a shirt, which I do remember as I helped her just didn\u2019t ask who it was for. The shirt had text bubbles and on it said, \u201cWhose your favorite?\u201d \u201cMe, I\u2019m my own favorite.\u201d She said it was from a conversation they had.\n\nI tell her she\u2019s flirting. They\u2019re both flirting. It sends the wrong message, shows to much effort. She denies it and said they are friends and that she always home makes gifts(true). That all they do is complain about work together and it\u2019s nice to have someone in her corner. I tell her she can get him a Starbucks gift card them. \n\nShe thinks I\u2019m being a controlling AH. But I think it\u2019s seriously inappropriate.

Me personally, I also on-boarded at my current job with one other person.  We spent our first few days together, even tho we would be on completely different teams.  We message each other a lot and have lunches with each other because it\u2019s a comfort thing.  We\u2019ve discussed getting drunk together outside of working hours.  I don\u2019t see anything wrong with having friends from work, especially because I know what it\u2019s like to be more comfortable with someone you onboarded with.  And since it\u2019s been 5-6 years, it makes sense to me that they\u2019re comfortable enough to exchange inside joke gifts and video calls.  I don\u2019t necessarily see it as flirting.\n\nThat being said, you know your wife better than we on Reddit do.  If her body language, facial\nexpressions, and overall demeanour make you suspicious, then talk to her.  Tell her your concerns and why.  Trying to control her isn\u2019t going to help.
