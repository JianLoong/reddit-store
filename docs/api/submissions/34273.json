She onboarded with coworker 36M and they always got along. She left the company for a while and he helped her secure a full time position. Cool. \n\nI\u2019ve never really cared about their relationship because it\u2019s always been strictly work and not much else. However this last year they seem to have grown closer. They are not on the same team but constantly messaging, giving work advice, she\u2019s invited to his team lunches etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything going on outside of work but I think it\u2019s broaching inappropriate.\n\nDown to the issue, it\u2019s New Year Eve, he video chats her to take a shot for the New Year. They end the call saying see you, and they\u2019ll bring gifts next in office day.\n\nI ask my wife what she got him. She say she made him a shirt, which I do remember as I helped her just didn\u2019t ask who it was for. The shirt had text bubbles and on it said, \u201cWhose your favorite?\u201d \u201cMe, I\u2019m my own favorite.\u201d She said it was from a conversation they had.\n\nI tell her she\u2019s flirting. They\u2019re both flirting. It sends the wrong message, shows to much effort. She denies it and said they are friends and that she always home makes gifts(true). That all they do is complain about work together and it\u2019s nice to have someone in her corner. I tell her she can get him a Starbucks gift card them. \n\nShe thinks I\u2019m being a controlling AH. But I think it\u2019s seriously inappropriate. So AITA\n\nEdit: Not allow, wrong wording. She can do whatever she wants but me stating what I\u2019m uncomfortable with.", "created_utc": 1704315353, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/18xtu7s/aita_for_not_allowing_my_wife_to_gift_her/", "score": 336, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She onboarded with coworker 36M and they always got along. She left the company for a while and he helped her secure a full time position. Cool. \n\nI\u2019ve never really cared about their relationship because it\u2019s always been strictly work and not much else. However this last year they seem to have grown closer. They are not on the same team but constantly messaging, giving work advice, she\u2019s invited to his team lunches etc. \n\nI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything going on outside of work but I think it\u2019s broaching inappropriate.\n\nDown to the issue, it\u2019s New Year Eve, he video chats her to take a shot for the New Year. They end the call saying see you, and they\u2019ll bring gifts next in office day.\n\nI ask my wife what she got him. She say she made him a shirt, which I do remember as I helped her just didn\u2019t ask who it was for. The shirt had text bubbles and on it said, \u201cWhose your favorite?\u201d \u201cMe, I\u2019m my own favorite.\u201d She said it was from a conversation they had.\n\nI tell her she\u2019s flirting. They\u2019re both flirting. It sends the wrong message, shows to much effort. She denies it and said they are friends and that she always home makes gifts(true). That all they do is complain about work together and it\u2019s nice to have someone in her corner. I tell her she can get him a Starbucks gift card them. \n\nShe thinks I\u2019m being a controlling AH. But I think it\u2019s seriously inappropriate.

Me personally, I also on-boarded at my current job with one other person.  We spent our first few days together, even tho we would be on completely different teams.  We message each other a lot and have lunches with each other because it\u2019s a comfort thing.  We\u2019ve discussed getting drunk together outside of working hours.  I don\u2019t see anything wrong with having friends from work, especially because I know what it\u2019s like to be more comfortable with someone you onboarded with.  And since it\u2019s been 5-6 years, it makes sense to me that they\u2019re comfortable enough to exchange inside joke gifts and video calls.  I don\u2019t necessarily see it as flirting.\n\nThat being said, you know your wife better than we on Reddit do.  If her body language, facial\nexpressions, and overall demeanour make you suspicious, then talk to her.  Tell her your concerns and why.  Trying to control her isn\u2019t going to help.

You're just pulling this doubt card because you're looking for any angle to justify judging him as harshly as possible.", "So, that\u2019s not a boundary.  A boundary is outlining what *your* behavior would be in response to *her* behavior.\n\nAn example (my old boundary with my mother): Mom, if you start acting like a victim during an argument, I will hang up the phone and take a 24hr timeout.\n\nIt\u2019s okay to realize that a behavior from someone else crosses a boundary you didn\u2019t know you had.  It\u2019s not okay to retroactively apply that boundary that you never knew/expressed before.  It\u2019s unfair to the other person because they didn\u2019t know they were crossing the boundary at the time.  I feel like making (and giving) the shirt falls under that.  She didn\u2019t know, when she was making the shirt with the intention of giving it to her friend, that this would cross a line for you.  Once you\u2019ve both calmed down, then you can express your boundary and outline the threshold and what your response would be.\n\nGiven that you didn\u2019t know who she was making the shirt for, maybe instead of making this adversarial, you should use this as an excuse to connect with her more.  Focus on spending time together (without phones) and sort of reconnect your hearts.  Don\u2019t mention your jealousy or the friend at all - just make time to pay more attention to each other.\n\n(I\u2019m not mentioning the NYE thing because I truly don\u2019t understand why that\u2019s a real problem, but maybe I don\u2019t feel the same way about NYE that y\u2019all do.  I would have taken the call from a friend of any gender and stepped away from the noise, too.  But what do I know?  I\u2019ve only been married for 30 years.)", "Not sure why i have to explain this to you, but an emotionally intelligent woman would not leave her husband to go call the man he has told her repeatedly he does not like. Do that some other time. Even if he was the one that called, she can always ignore and call back some other time. \n\nPoint is, this is not just a random friend, it's a \"friend\" that had caused a couple of discussions and possibly fights. \n\nPlus it probably was a lengthy call if he had to notice her absence, look other places, before finding her in one of the rooms just ending the call.", "Sneaking out of a party of friends and family to secretly spend midnight toasting the new year with a guy that is not her husband is definitely not normal. OPs discomfort with the gift stems from that incident; they clearly were not uncomfortable with this friendship before this point, but frankly, that's a very obvious red flag that his wife is, at minimum, having an emotional affair.", "Well duh, why would he be worried about a woman?", "Some of us only leave the house to take out the garbage...\n\nI am joking, but not joking in that I felt nostalgic for touching nice grass (it is cold and dark right now so I cannot check the quality of the grass with my hand)", "I welcome mods fo check my IP.\n\nI assume the paranoid person randomly making a mountain out of a molehill of people <checks notes> agreeing with eachother and accusing people of using seconds accounts couldn't possibly be OP on a second account.", "\"Wife, I'd like it if you didn't eat almonds around me, I'm mildly allergic\"\n\n\"Wow what a controlling husband you are\" \n\nBetter for your poor soul there?", "You should really edit that into the story.", "Yeah this is sus af...", "The gift isn\u2019t even that weird.  THIS IS THOUGH!", "Dude that\u2019s suspect as hell. My wife would never go to another room to toast someone else a happy New Year, especially ringing in the New Year with this co worker.", "I'm still a bit confused, when you say you were all saying happy NY, do you mean this phone call happened literally during the count down to midnight? Like clock struck 12 and she was on the phone doing a shot with her co-worker? Because yeah, that's pretty odd behavior and would warrant a deeper conversation in my opinion. I wouldn't say it's verifiable proof of infidelity, but I would be concerned as well. \n\nBut if this was just at a random point earlier in the night, then I wouldn't put too much stock into it. Friends wish each other Happy (insert Holiday here) all the time and it's not a sign of anything crazy for her to take a call like that.", "Dude. Holy shit this is what you need to focus on. The gift, not that out there but this? Shit dude. You need to have a serious conversation with your wife and ask her what is going on.", "So y\u2019all were at a party, you were each doing your own thing until midnight, when you decided to look for her. In the meantime, she\u2019d gotten a call from her friend and stepped out of the room to answer, presumably someplace quieter. You can\u2019t demand her undivided attention if you\u2019re not giving her yours.", "I'd be livid honestly.", "No. Answering the call at all is NOT something \u201canyone would do\u201d.", "Stop just stop...\nYou guys try to defend a cheater.\nShe works with that dude, keep writing with him, goes into a another room and cut it out fast ssap once husband enters the room.\n\nEver ask yourself why she go into another room in the middle of the night, wish the other dude as FIRST person happy new year? Rather to go to hrr husband.\n\nFlirty messages, weird acts, constance texting.\n\nRead another subs to know what is happening her.\nIf you don't have any plan, stop try to give any advise. His wife act very suspicious and alone the fact she cut asap the phone call when husband come into room, shows the hide something.\n\nOP, I read and see in real life lot of similar stories. Trust you guts and look at her phone, let her cut any contact to that guy. He clearly wants her and she don't disagree so far with him.", "What are you yapping about? A boundary is what you as a person are comfortable with and/or willing to accept. Your partner can overstep what you are comfortable with tolerating in a relationship.", "That's ur opinion cause ur insecure. \n\nSo we're just gonna assume it was lengthy? Lol", "U went to something that was a danger to their life....do u not see how that's still an extreme? Lol", "Really I thought the gift was worst then the call so I glossed over it. But apparently it\u2019s more normal then I think.", "THIS. I took a call around midnight this year from my guy bff, but I stayed right next to my partner and included him in the call. My bff is more flirty towards my partner than he ever is to me, which I think is hilarious.", "You are supposed to be with the people closest to you at midnight, partner/children,etc. There is no need to be at each other's side the whole night but midnight is the important part. It's supposed to signify who you want to spend the next year with. Obviously OP's wife wants to spend it with work \"friend\".", "\"Husband, can you move your shoes from that spot? I've stubbed my toe on them a couple of times\"\n\n\"Wow what a controlling wife you are\"\n\nThird times the charm for your incredibly tiny brain", "People can be weird with gifts, especially when they think of the right gift to make, like I assume your wife did.\n\nThe secret call and shot at midnight is way more concerning.", "I was fully YTA in the post as written but the fact she left a party you were at to go into a private room to share New Years with the coworker is really bad. She should be sharing that moment with you and it was extremely in appropriate and concerning she did that. \n\nMaking handmade gifts or having inside jokes is completely normal to me though.", "The gift was normal, the call was weird and sus.", "The gift sounds fine, the midnight NYE call is way worse", "Ducking out of your party to toast and bring in the new year together is problematic.  I was on the fence about the shirt but in addition to the midnight video call, you\u2019ve got a problem.  You really should add that info to the main post. \n\nNTA", "Since she\u2019s known to make homemade gifts its normal but what happened to kissing your SO at midnight why was she more worried about taking his call", "The phone call is more sus than the gift. She made her friend a homemade gift, not a big deal. She left you on NYE to bring in the new year with a different man in a different room, kind of more important in my eyes", "You do realize that's a question right? Not a command? But sure I'm the tiny brain one. Can't even tell the difference between telling someone what to do and asking them to do something lol", "I think this could speak to a problem in the relationship. I understand his POV, but have we asked WHY she's spending so much time with the friend and not him? Like the story he told was all about the gift. That was the worse thing for him. He can't understand why she would make a heartfelt gift for any friend male or female according to him. Is he emotionally THERE for his wife if she's the gift making type and he thinks she should be handing out giftcards? It is inappropriate that she wasn't there on NYE, but it could be that she doesn't feel comfortable sharing those moments with him. She could 100% still just be friends with this person, and just not feel emotionally connected to her husband.\n\nHe does come off as controlling, and I can't understand being mad that someone makes a gift for their friend, especially when he's clear that the gender and the possibility of cheating ISN'T the issue in the gift situation. It's the fact that she's that emotionally connected to anybody. That's his issue. I think there's more here than we'll know because he's the only side of the story."]}
