Children need help with holidays. And your child shouldn't have to read your mind or know your \"love language\" (strange that you use that phrase with your child). It sounds to me like you are parentifying him, wanting him to comfort you and show you love as a parent might. I hear that you are sad over the loss of your mother, and I feel for you. But it is not your child's responsibility to make you feel better, even on a sad Mother's Day.", "Happy mother's day! Super gentle YTA because a 13yo boy can't possibly understand another person's love language. The fact that he wished you a happy mother's day is probably a lot more than most moms of 13yos got.\n\nHe'll get better with age, I promise. My kids are in their 20s and this might be the first year all of them remembered without prompting.", "As somebody who was parentified and was organizing breakfasts and using spare change to buy gifts at his age... I'm kinda happy for your son because he's still a kid who thinks remembering it's mother's day and congratulating you is enough. NAH, and you might not see it like that, but I think you're a great mom because he's felt no pressure", "NAH. teens can be lazy and moody and not very understanding of people's feelings sometimes; it's part of growing up. you're definitely not expecting too much, but i don't think he realizes you're expecting anything at all. at that age, sometimes you need to spell things out for them when it comes to situations like these. communicate with him about it, be very straightforward.", "NAH.\n\nYou're not an asshole for being sad and disappointed, he's not an asshole for being a dumb teenager. Par for the course. He'll figure it out eventually.\n\nHappy mother's day though. Hang in there.", "Soft YTA. What you're expecting needs to be taught. You have only your own parenting to blame if you are not raising him to show appreciation. Understanding love languages is not something I would expect a 13 year old to have somehow picked up on in a vacuum.", "I think you can feel that way. Maybe your  expectations are a little high to expect a 13 year old boy to pick up on what to do for you on Mother\u2019s Day. Sometimes grown men aren\u2019t even good at that. Probably just missing your mom, so it makes it seem more sad than it actually might be. Happy Mothers Day to you! I say show him a little grace.", "A gentle YTA.

If you have higher aspirations for Mother\u2019s Day then as bad as it sounds I\u2019d find another adult who will recognize and shower gifts upon you.  Don\u2019t expect anything until the child is old enough to get a job.  This is the age you need to teach him how to show his appreciation for others.  Do you go to the cemetery to visit your mom and put flowers?  Do you go to church and light a candle or say a prayer for her?

It sounds like you are sad about your own mom and are transferring your feelings about mothering and being mothered onto your child.", "I can't even with this. Your love language? You're talking about a little boy who is just in his first year as a teenager, not your romantic partner, ffs. And he said happy mother's day to you. That's a lot more than many women get. \n\nI'll bet if he had brought you some toast, juice, and coffee/tea for breakfast that you would have complained it wasn't good enough. \n\nIt seems to me that you're putting partner expectations on your child, and it's kind of giving me a weird vibe, tbh. \n\nYTA", "INFO: How would he have known what you wanted/expected from him? \n\n1) No one is born with the knowledge of mother's day and/or father's day\n\n2) You said you're a single mom, so based on that, I'd assume he hasn't been celebrating father's day, which means he doesn't have a framework to mirror for mother's day \n\n3) You could have mentioned a week ahead of time and communicated to him what you were hoping for \n\nI'm just not sure how you expected him to know what to do?? He's only 13??", "NTA, but my dear, he's 13.  Many if not most 13 year olds are self-absorbed.  Don't take it personally.  He's not your spouse, he's your kid, and he's going to act like he's 13.  In a few weeks, or months, sit down with him and explain exactly how you feel.  Even if he rolls his eyes, it will register.  Hey, he wished you a happy Mother's Day!  From a 13 year old, that is something to be celebrated!!", "NAH, 13 year olds are dumb as hell. Happy Mother\u2019s Day tho", "YTA.\n\nOne he's 13 mothers day is likely not even really on his radar. The fact he remembered it was amazing. I forgot what day it is, and im 29. \n\nAnd heres the thing, you cannot expect ANYONE (child, partner etc) to read your mind. You need to make your wants and desires known. If you want your kid to do an extra chore, or make dinner/lunch then you HAVE to tell them so. you cannot just expect anyone (esp a teenager who's thankfully able to BE a teenager and not need to grow up to fast) to just magically know what to do. \n\nalso be careful with the whole \"raising them to celebrate everyone else\" because depending on how they mature, and how its taught, a person can fall into the habit of \"make everyone else happy, I should be dead last if at all\" to easily. I used to be that people pleaser and I just now am finding my voice. and my coworkers aint gonna like it. (well one won't) because I cannot keep lighting myself on fire to warm others. \n\nYour son should be taught that he should be kind to others and that being thoughtful on special days doesn't have to mean shelling out tons of $$$ to make them happy, and just dont let people take advantage of their kindness. and maybe sit down and talk to him. Talk to him about if he even finds holidays important (some people don't some like myself see many holidays as \"Hallmark\" holidays and aren't worth it. But I am also a jaded non-binary person who also had to grow up way to fast because my mum needed someone responsible and she made stupid partner decisions so I stepped up. I admit im jaded as hell) but just sit and talk with him, find out how HE feels about the holidays coming up etc and maybe do a \"make up mothers day\" another day where yall do something fun together since he made you a mother, and you are his mother and it can be used to celebrate each other without putting societal pressure on either of you to make it a big thing.", "I haven't read the other comments but when my kids were that age we would have had a conversation about what was happening on Mothers Day. I would have told them that I just want to share a special breakfast with them, and some amount of time (so a walk in a park/beach, a movie, or even video games). My expectation has always been that they do the majority of breakfast prep and they were both capable at 13 of doing that.", "INFO: Are cooking and cleaning around the house responsibilities he normally has?\n\nIf not, then I would say Y T A for not integrating those skills WITH him already in a way that would make it easier for him to do for you as a special occasion.\n\nAlternately, are there any family members you could enlist to maybe nudge and encourage him next year and/or help him figure out something nice to do? If you're a single mom, I know it feels weird to insist on celebrating yourself, but you could have other adults in his life help him (and you) here.", "YTA. HE IS YOUR SON NOT A PARTNER.", "He at least acknowledged Mother's Day.  Anymore, it seems like I go online on Mother's Day and just see a whole bunch of mothers who are disappointed because their families didn't do exactly what they wanted.  As a single mother, if you want it to be special, go do something nice for yourself in the future when it comes to Mother's Day.  Or plan a nice activity for you to do with your son.  If you want him to do the dishes, ask!  All these expectations mothers have just set them up for disappointment anyhow.", "NTA but unless someone else is reminding him that he should be doing something, there is a very good chance that a 13 year old boy is too distracted and/or self absorbed to go out of his way to do\u2019s something special even though he may love you very much.", "NAH - OP commented later that she wasn't punishing the child for this.  I agree she's right to feel sad that he did nothing further; on the other hand, it's a 13 year old boy, so no surprise at all.  \n\nOP:  hope things improve next year.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n~~YTA - why do you think you're entitled to anything other than a polite greeting?  Gifts are supposed to be voluntary; demanding one and exacting punishment for not getting it means that the \"gift\" is actually meant to be \"tribute\".~~", "NTA. I'm sure that it's hurting more due to the loss of your mother as well as being a single mother. Your son seems like the only one you have who can show appreciation for you, and he didn't do much to express that. By his age I was plotting small ways I could make my mom happy on mother's day, even if it was just spending the whole day doing stuff she wanted (like watching a movie I don't like but she does or accompanying her to a store she likes). But also he is still young, and might not be aware that it means that much to you. I don't think you need to feel as bad as you do, however. I'm sorry that the day may have been rough on you, but a young teen can only do so much for that anyway.", "My parents don\u2019t care about Hallmark Holidays so I can\u2019t really relate to this but he did about as much as you can expect from the youth so I\u2019ll suggest NAH.", "Happy Mother\u2019s Day, OP!\n\nNAH. At 13, there\u2019s little he can arrange to do.
