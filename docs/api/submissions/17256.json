But it is not your child's responsibility to make you feel better, even on a sad Mother's Day.", "Happy mother's day! Super gentle YTA because a 13yo boy can't possibly understand another person's love language. The fact that he wished you a happy mother's day is probably a lot more than most moms of 13yos got.\n\nHe'll get better with age, I promise. My kids are in their 20s and this might be the first year all of them remembered without prompting.", "As somebody who was parentified and was organizing breakfasts and using spare change to buy gifts at his age...

NAH, and you might not see it like that, but I think you're a great mom because he's felt no pressure", "NAH. teens can be lazy and moody and not very understanding of people's feelings sometimes; it's part of growing up. you're definitely not expecting too much, but i don't think he realizes you're expecting anything at all. at that age, sometimes you need to spell things out for them when it comes to situations like these. communicate with him about it, be very straightforward.", "NAH.\n\nYou're not an asshole for being sad and disappointed, he's not an asshole for being a dumb teenager.

Maybe your  expectations are a little high to expect a 13 year old boy to pick up on what to do for you on Mother\u2019s Day. Sometimes grown men aren\u2019t even good at that.

Don\u2019t expect anything until the child is old enough to get a job.  This is the age you need to teach him how to show his appreciation for others.

In a few weeks, or months, sit down with him and explain exactly how you feel.  Even if he rolls his eyes, it will register.  Hey, he wished you a happy Mother's Day!  From a 13 year old, that is something to be celebrated!!", "NAH, 13 year olds are dumb as hell. Happy Mother\u2019s Day tho", "YTA.\n\nOne he's 13 mothers day is likely not even really on his radar. The fact he remembered it was amazing. I forgot what day it is, and im 29. \n\nAnd heres the thing, you cannot expect ANYONE (child, partner etc) to read your mind. You need to make your wants and desires known. If you want your kid to do an extra chore, or make dinner/lunch then you HAVE to tell them so. you cannot just expect anyone (esp a teenager who's thankfully able to BE a teenager and not need to grow up to fast) to just magically know what to do. \n\nalso be careful with the whole \"raising them to celebrate everyone else\" because depending on how they mature, and how its taught, a person can fall into the habit of \"make everyone else happy, I should be dead last if at all\" to easily. I used to be that people pleaser and I just now am finding my voice. and my coworkers aint gonna like it. (well one won't) because I cannot keep lighting myself on fire to warm others. \n\nYour son should be taught that he should be kind to others and that being thoughtful on special days doesn't have to mean shelling out tons of $$$ to make them happy, and just dont let people take advantage of their kindness. and maybe sit down and talk to him. Talk to him about if he even finds holidays important (some people don't some like myself see many holidays as \"Hallmark\" holidays and aren't worth it. But I am also a jaded non-binary person who also had to grow up way to fast because my mum needed someone responsible and she made stupid partner decisions so I stepped up. I admit im jaded as hell) but just sit and talk with him, find out how HE feels about the holidays coming up etc and maybe do a \"make up mothers day\" another day where yall do something fun together since he made you a mother, and you are his mother and it can be used to celebrate each other without putting societal pressure on either of you to make it a big thing.", "I haven't read the other comments but when my kids were that age we would have had a conversation about what was happening on Mothers Day. I would have told them that I just want to share a special breakfast with them, and some amount of time (so a walk in a park/beach, a movie, or even video games). My expectation has always been that they do the majority of breakfast prep and they were both capable at 13 of doing that.", "INFO: Are cooking and cleaning around the house responsibilities he normally has?\n\nIf not, then I would say Y T A for not integrating those skills WITH him already in a way that would make it easier for him to do for you as a special occasion.\n\nAlternately, are there any family members you could enlist to maybe nudge and encourage him next year and/or help him figure out something nice to do? If you're a single mom, I know it feels weird to insist on celebrating yourself, but you could have other adults in his life help him (and you) here.", "YTA. HE IS YOUR SON NOT A PARTNER.", "He at least acknowledged Mother's Day.  Anymore, it seems like I go online on Mother's Day and just see a whole bunch of mothers who are disappointed because their families didn't do exactly what they wanted.  As a single mother, if you want it to be special, go do something nice for yourself in the future when it comes to Mother's Day.  Or plan a nice activity for you to do with your son.  If you want him to do the dishes, ask!  All these expectations mothers have just set them up for disappointment anyhow.", "NTA but unless someone else is reminding him that he should be doing something, there is a very good chance that a 13 year old boy is too distracted and/or self absorbed to go out of his way to do\u2019s something special even though he may love you very much.", "NAH - OP commented later that she wasn't punishing the child for this.

I appreciate that you did ask him to make you food and he just didn't, which I'm sure really hurt. But he may have just gotten distracted and could've used someone keeping him on task, or maybe he didn't think it was time sensitive or something you felt strongly about. I don't think it is a given that teenagers will be indifferent, but people have different personalities and maybe acts of service do not seem meaningful to him, so he didn't put much stock in that. Maybe he needs to hear from you just what it would mean to you if he did those things for you. Not in guilt trip way, but because he can't read minds, and he will only know his own experience/reality until you explicitly tell him yours.\n\nAll I'm saying is, I certainly would do things unprompted for my mom on mother's day as a teenager, and so would all of my friends, but we also had grown up with traditions to follow on what to do for mother's day, and those of us who had single mothers were given structure by their mom for that day (like they spent their younger years making the same special breakfast together until the kid was old enough to make it themselves, and they knew exactly what was expected, plus the habit was ingrained). Teens can absolutely go out of their way to show love and gratitude to parents.

At least I got handmade cards and handmade flowers from my other 2 kids. \n\n13 just sucks.", "Just because it\u2019s your \u2018love language\u2019 (what a godawful expression) don\u2019t expect everyone else to speak it. \n\nYTA albeit a gentle one.", "ESH.

Then again, the kid should know to do SOMETHING for you. ESH.", "YTA\n\n>Me at 13 was very different but not because I'm different really, just because my mom had cancer and it made me grow up a lot faster.\n\nKnow exactly what that's like - it's made raising my own a bit of a head-spinner at times as I've thought to myself: _I knew how to do this at that age so why don't you?_ - only to realise that it's really unfair to compare upbringings and what we've learnt given they've been so different.\n\nIt's not a race, we all move at different paces and also have to go through totally different circumstances which drive how we develop. I didn't just learn how to make my bed and maybe put some laundry away, I had to work out how to also wash everything, the difference between light/darks and what temps things needed to be at as well as totally make my own food, run the dishwasher, know how to wash up properly and put things away.\n\nI look at some _adults_ and they barely comprehend one or the other, nevermind both! But again - unfair comparison as some folks had a lot of things done for them, or they just never needed to think about it as a partner did it and told them to never worry, etc.\n\nAlso based on age - I'm willing to bet you that most schools also never touch on these subjects, it's stuff taught to them via exposure and determining if they should do it too - like other kids, or seeing it in the street etc - many kids just won't ever process or work out \"oh, I need to give Mum/Dad a gift _and_ a card\", or realise the emotional importance of these things to you.\n\nCommunicate, discuss and expose your offspring to these things, sure some won't pay attention and some things will be more/less interesting than others to them - but at least trying makes sure you've expressed to them at least on some level the importance these things play to people so they can independently decide these things themselves in the future.\n\nE.G: For _you_, Mother/Father's day is \"just another day\". You get a card and maybe a small gift for your parent(s). Some, or as they age, will determine this is to express your love, gratitude and/or appreciation for what they've done for you over the years and still do etc etc but as kids? It really _is_, for many, \"just another thing\" like Easter or whatever, it has little impact or importance to them _unless_ they've been taught/shown otherwise.\n\nBut for _them_ it's a big thing, showing your child cares, loves you _back_ and also that they think/remember/care - for some it's a _momentous_ thing that there's a buildup to each year. Missing it or getting nothing really hits like a sledgehammer.\n\nBut again - if kids or yourself don't balance these things, aren't exposed to it, don't communicate it etc.....well then sure, these things happen where you feel hit by a truck and they are literally clueless.", "I don't think you're an asshole, but mildly in the wrong.\n\nFirst of all, love languages aren't real, they're not a real thing, they were made up by a guy selling books.\n\nSecond of all, even if love languages were real, just assuming your son will abide by *your* love languages isn't all that cool.\n\nThird of all, not everybody does the Hallmark days, they can be nice for people who like them, but lets not pretend these are real holidays that society naturally created.\n\nFourth of all, he's 13, lower your expectations.

The way you express love can extend beyond a spouse. \n\nI don\u2019t think expecting something special on Mother\u2019s Day from your children is treating your child like a spouse or even expecting them to realize that you prefer nice gestures instead of gifts.

And at age 13, both boys and girls should be receiving regular opportunities from their parents to practice the skills. And no, I don\u2019t think more girls than boys find the act of giftgiving inherently enjoyable. I think girls are socialized to seek gratification from pleasing others, while boys are socialized to seek it in other ways. But, agree or disagree with me about that, both boys and girls should be taught, especially in childhood and early adolescence, to think about other people, keep track of important occasions, and be empathetic about how people they care about might like to receive love from them.", "You know, you can make anything true if you just assert that people were socialised to be otherwise."]}
