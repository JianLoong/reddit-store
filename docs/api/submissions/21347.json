You don\u2019t want to be one for whatever reason, the bride will have to respect that", "2k for a bridesmaid dres?!??!? I paid $120 for my sisters wedding and we got featured on the photographer and wedding venue website!!!\n\nNTA GET RID OF THIS GIRL NO ONE LIKES HER FOR A REASON", "NTA for not wanting to pay bridesmaid expenses for someone you don\u2019t even like. \n\nYou shouldn\u2019t even have had her as your bridesmaid. And you\u2019re within your rights to point out she didn\u2019t have to pay for your wedding. \n\nYou don\u2019t even like her, why go to the wedding.", "No.\nYou were considerate to pay.\nThis is not someone you hold in high regard, why should you pay so much? You got a way out of the madness. Enjoy. NTA", "NTA - regardless of situation, there is no obligation to be in a wedding party. End of story.", "Seriously.  Anne needs to grow the fuck up. NTA", "Absolutely ridiculous price if she's not covering the cost!", "How tf is OP \u201ctoying with Belle\u2019s emotions?\u201d Making her a bridesmaid was not some sort of unbreakable social contract that obligated OP to serve in the same role if asked. Life changes, circumstances change, and being a bridesmaid for this person doesn\u2019t work for OP. She has exactly as much right to decline the role as Belle had when OP extended the same offer.", "Anne has other friends. Belle does not. You may want to ask Anne why she thinks that is.", "> I didn't want to stress with the friend breakup along with all the other wedding stuff.\n\nYou realize this was YOUR wedding, right?  Not Anne's -- as your MoH, she should have been supporting you.", "OP, I get wanting to protect the sensitive people in your life, I do that too, but Anne is a grown woman. Being \"sensitive\" stops being an excuse once you're pushing 30. Be big girls and have the hard conversations, this isn't high school.", "I don't think 2k for a bridesmaid dress is within reason at all.", "All of that sounds like you have a \\*massive\\* Anne Problem, but if you choose not to deal with it that's on you. And, in a small way, on Anne.\n\nESH", "If Anne truly doesn't value this friendship, now is the time to break the ties. She can gracefully turn down being a bridesmaid,  citing financial issues, which is true. Belle will likely have a massive temper tantrum and cut ties. Problem solved, especially if you both block her afterwards.", "Does Anne impose Belle on all her friends or just you?", "Please read this and then share this essay with Ann, it seems applicable to her and belle [\u201cDon\u2019t rock the boat, an essay\u201d](https://www.reddit.com/user/ForwardPlenty/comments/b14k31/copy_of_rock_the_boat_essay/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)", "You were kind to invite Belle to your wedding. Beyond kind to make her a bridesmaid when you don\u2019t even like her. But you owe her nothing. Not to go to her wedding and not to be a bridesmaid.", "I don\u2019t know if OP sucks, but this whole post is just flat out insanity. OP dislikes this girl but makes her a bridesmaid. (Uhh...I don\u2019t even understand this logic.) And *now* the awful non-friend is acting like she\u2019s doing OP a massive favour by making them spend *more* time together, and pay huge amounts of money to do it? Just cut her off. Block. Kick her off your SM.\n\n>she told me that I should have sucked it up and paid.  \n\nWhat...what\u2019s happening here? Is everyone okay? Do they all need to get out and spend some time in the real world? Crazy, just crazy.", "Yeah that\u2019s such a weird take. Seems more like OP just wants to look like the better person here \ud83d\ude44", "That\u2019s what I\u2019m saying. OP is not telling the whole story", "Yea when my late husband and I got married, I picked gowns for my bridesmaids that were *maybe* $150. Like....TWO GRAND?! for a bridesmaids dress they'll wear ONCE?! \ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33\ud83d\ude33", "No, no one's ok. Belle is a jerk and a mean girl, Anne is a door mat, and OP seems to have some sort of savior complex regarding Anne."]}
