There is just so much wrong with this situation. I hope you can have a talk with Anne and explain your feelings without it ruining your friendship, but if not, then the friendship probably wasn\u2019t as close as you thought.", "NTA.  Asking someone to be a bridesmaid is an invitation.  There is no obligation to accept it.\n\nAnd what a weird reaction to try and pressure you by threatening to remove Anne from the bridal party.

The best case scenario is Anne realizing all of this and ending the friendship.  The cherry on top is she will be $2K richer for it.", "It would be better to waste $2K on someone you do like.

You paid for all expenses at your wedding but now she expects you to pay for them all at hers? Hell No!  You are under no obligation to spend $2k for a bridesmaid dress if you don\u2019t want to.

If you paid, Anne would have to pay too and be more in debt.", "NTA.\n\nAnne's actually relieved but still expecting you to have \"sucked up and paid\"? Ugh.

I am also surprised that Anne told you to pay. \nIf you don't like a person, you shouldn't pay for anything extra if it comes to parties and weddings. You made one mistake by asking Belle to be a bridesmaid at your wedding. However if she doesn't pay for expenses like you did, you have the right to say no. \n TBH, if I were you I wouldn't attend the wedding at all.", "NTA. And you may want to rethink your friendship with Anne as well. She can't be relieved because of the cost but still give you crap because she's hurt. She should take her issue up with Belle!!

You don't want to, you don't need to, and you don't need to justify it with anybody.\n\nAlso, when anybody says, \"could easily afford the expense\" it's a major red flag. What you can afford is strictly your business. What you're willing to pay for, or even want to pay for, is similarly your business. It's an aggressive act to state that \"you can afford it\", because it's reckless disregard for the truth of the statement: they have no way of really knowing.\n\nAnne should not be trying to get you to spend your money, and to spend money she says she can't afford, on Belle. Neither of you want to be friends with her. \"She has no other friends\" is not a good reason not to drop her, especially when there seems to be a good reason for no other friends.", "I mean typically the bride's party pays for their own stuff, so it's not that far out of line for her to ask you to do that. You paid for your bridal party, that's nice of you, but it wasn't required so to expect everyone else to do the same (and be able to afford it) is unfair of you. Of course, there's no requirement that you be a part of her bridal party, but to turn it down because she isn't paying for the dress is an AH move.\n\n$2k is a bit much to expect anyone to pay for a dress, so I don't see why all her bridal party doesn't just insist that she choose a dress within their price ranges.

Anne has a lot of insecurities and is sensitive, so whenever I come along, I shield her from Belle. \n\nThe only reason why I've dealt with Belle so long is that Anne wants to keep the peace. I don't know why she's hanging onto a friend that so clearly looks down on her. \n\nI do admit it was a dumb move to invite Belle to be a bridesmaid but I didn't want to stress with the friend breakup along with all the other wedding stuff. \n\nAnd yeah, Belle is completely within reason to ask for us to cover our own expenses.
