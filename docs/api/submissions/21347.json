I had a friend like that, she would criticize me in every way. I ended it one day when it was just enough, it was the best decision ever. The level of stress and toxicity was just unbearable at the end. And it might sound cliche, but life is too short to literally waste your precious time (LIMITED time) on this earth on people like that.", "No, you\u2019re NTA but you might need to reevaluate your friendship with Anne if she\u2019s going to continue making Belle your problem.  \n\nYour BEST FRIEND should not be guilting you into having a woman who has only ever been rude to you in your wedding or guilting you into being that same awful woman\u2019s wedding just so she can be a part of it. There is just so much wrong with this situation. I hope you can have a talk with Anne and explain your feelings without it ruining your friendship, but if not, then the friendship probably wasn\u2019t as close as you thought.", "NTA.  Asking someone to be a bridesmaid is an invitation.  There is no obligation to accept it.\n\nAnd what a weird reaction to try and pressure you by threatening to remove Anne from the bridal party.  If Belle actually cared about her friendship with Anne, she wouldn't have done that.  Or picked such an expensive dress that knowing at least one of her bridesmaids could not comfortably afford it.  The best case scenario is Anne realizing all of this and ending the friendship.  The cherry on top is she will be $2K richer for it.", "It would be better to waste $2K on someone you do like.  NTA", "NTA. belle fucking sucks and honestly you should cut her off and not attend the wedding", "NTA\n\nI mean 2k is a lot for something ou don' t even want, for somebody you don' t even like.\n\nTbh Anne is being lowkey AH for making you go along with this person, I mean  this isn' t high school. You should have mature conversation with Anne about how you actually don; t want to be friends with this toxic person and if she insists on hanging out with her she should do it separately.", "Sucks for Belle. She\u2019s a bully towards you. Why would she even ask you to begin with, I don\u2019t get it. She doesn\u2019t need bridesmaids, especially when she can\u2019t afford them.\n\nI personally think you\u2019re NTA. You paid for your own bridesmaids, a on time expense and eventhough you could pay for yourself now, you chose the smarter route by saving the money for your future.", "Nta - sounds like you and Anne may be better off without this toxic entity in your life.

Stop being around people that are draining and making a fuss, it's not that hard. She's obviously a toxic friend to all, and you don't owe her anything.", "100% NTA.  You paid for all expenses at your wedding but now she expects you to pay for them all at hers? Hell No!  You are under no obligation to spend $2k for a bridesmaid dress if you don\u2019t want to.  Do you know what you could with  $2k besides stand next to a woman you don\u2019t really like but tolerate. Keep you money and go as a guest if you want and help Anne get out of it if you can. Just remember. You\u2019re NTA.", "$2K for a bridesmaid\u2019s dress?! What a rude bride to pick something so expensive. You\u2019re NTA.", "NTA but I agree with the other poster- you do need to re-evaulate your friendship with Anne if she can't be a true friend and leave Belle alone. This isn't fair to you. But also, if Anne can't afford it and is relieved, why is she acting hurt? If you paid, Anne would have to pay too and be more in debt.", "NTA.\n\nAnne's actually relieved but still expecting you to have \"sucked up and paid\"? Ugh. She needs to grow a spine and stand up to Belle. \n\nNo, you weren't the asshole and you absolutely did the right thing. Good for you.", "Let belle have away with her narcissistic thoughts. Stand your ground.", "NTA  You never have to be in someone's wedding whether you can afford it or not, nor whether they pay for everything or not. Good call.", "Belle is an asshole. I am also surprised that Anne told you to pay. \nIf you don't like a person, you shouldn't pay for anything extra if it comes to parties and weddings. You made one mistake by asking Belle to be a bridesmaid at your wedding. However if she doesn't pay for expenses like you did, you have the right to say no. \n TBH, if I were you I wouldn't attend the wedding at all.", "NTA. And you may want to rethink your friendship with Anne as well. She can't be relieved because of the cost but still give you crap because she's hurt. She should take her issue up with Belle!! Belle is using Anne to get you to be part of her wedding. Anne's mad at the wrong person. Just stop being part of anything that Belle is part of at this point. Life is too short to let others make you miserable.", "NTA. You don't want to, you don't need to, and you don't need to justify it with anybody.\n\nAlso, when anybody says, \"could easily afford the expense\" it's a major red flag. What you can afford is strictly your business. What you're willing to pay for, or even want to pay for, is similarly your business. It's an aggressive act to state that \"you can afford it\", because it's reckless disregard for the truth of the statement: they have no way of really knowing.\n\nAnne should not be trying to get you to spend your money, and to spend money she says she can't afford, on Belle. Neither of you want to be friends with her. \"She has no other friends\" is not a good reason not to drop her, especially when there seems to be a good reason for no other friends.", "I mean typically the bride's party pays for their own stuff, so it's not that far out of line for her to ask you to do that. You paid for your bridal party, that's nice of you, but it wasn't required so to expect everyone else to do the same (and be able to afford it) is unfair of you. Of course, there's no requirement that you be a part of her bridal party, but to turn it down because she isn't paying for the dress is an AH move.\n\n$2k is a bit much to expect anyone to pay for a dress, so I don't see why all her bridal party doesn't just insist that she choose a dress within their price ranges. ESH", "you were nice to her letting her be your bridesmaid but you don't owe her anything, especially 2k for a dress when you don't even like her\u2026 def nta", "$2000 for a bridesmaid dress? Is it embroidered with diamonds? I\u2019d say no on principle, especially since you don\u2019t even like the bride. And after the brides\u2019 words I\u2019d actually not go to the wedding and consider myself lucky.\n\nNTA (edited for judgme)", "NTA", "NTA - you are under no obligation to be a bridesmaid, especially in this situation.", "I don't think Anne is an asshole because Belle bullies everyone, in fact, Anne the most. Anne has a lot of insecurities and is sensitive, so whenever I come along, I shield her from Belle. \n\nThe only reason why I've dealt with Belle so long is that Anne wants to keep the peace. I don't know why she's hanging onto a friend that so clearly looks down on her. \n\nI do admit it was a dumb move to invite Belle to be a bridesmaid but I didn't want to stress with the friend breakup along with all the other wedding stuff. \n\nAnd yeah, Belle is completely within reason to ask for us to cover our own expenses. But like the other commenters said, it's kind of weird for her to ask me to put up that money when she knows we are only mutual friends at best.", "I agree, you are all almost 30 and now is a good time to not just go along with someone who you think is a bully and have no shared values with. I get that Anne is a \"dear friend\" but a dear friend wouldn't make you hang out with someone who is a bully. It's time to cut Belle out completely.", "Yes, exactly.  These ladies are in their late 20's.  OP should have that conversation with Anne.  There is no reason for either of these ladies to maintain a relationship with Belle if they aren't enjoying the time spent with Belle.  \n\nAnd that 2K... that is just for the dress!  There are still the shoes, hair, makeup, bachelorette party, etc. etc. etc.  Like OP, I have the funds, but I'd turn it down, too.  That's a lot of money for someone else's \"special day.\"", "For reals. 2k for a bridesmaid dress? Wth. Even if I could afford that, I would not spend that for a bridesmaid dress. Belle can make demands when she pays for all of OP\u2019s expenses. OP did the right thing by turning it down. NTA", "From how I read it, OP didn't mind paying for a dress- she just didn't want to pay $2K. And that's fair. She's not the A H bc she doesn't want to spend that much on someone who bullies her"]}
