{"id": 14495, "submission_id": "12hysbr", "title": "AITA for telling my stepdaughter she needs to clean up her mess?", "selftext": "My (40sF) stepdaughter (12F) is throwing a fit over cleanliness rules. I'm normally not one to butt heads with a child, but she just will not give this one up.\n\n5 years ago, I moved in with SD and her father. We live in SD's childhood home. It was ugly and outdated when I moved in and since then I have greatly increased our resell value. One of the main things we did was tearing up most of the flooring and laying down hardwood floor. Now, I'm sure most of you know that hardwood requires a lot of care to maintain, and I work hard to keep things clean.\n\nSD does not like to keep this clean. She hates doing the dishes and laundry. She hates dusting the house. She hates vacuuming. She hates cleaning. I, on the other hand, like to have a clean home, and their house was absolutely not up to my cleanliness standards when I moved in.\n\nHere's the issue: I have rules for SD that she doesn't like. One of them is no touching the walls because fingers leave dirty trail/grease marks. Another is no shoes, socks, or bare feet on the floor. We all have house slippers to wear. \n\nWe have a cleaner that comes once a week and deep cleans the entire house. This includes mopping the floors. I'm very proud of how spotless the kitchen floors are, but SD is constantly forgetting her slippers and leaving them in her room. Yesterday, I woke up to find that she had been in the kitchen in her socks, because I could see the footprints from her sweaty sock on the floor. I called her down to look at it and she forgot her slippers then too! She was barefoot when she can see how that leaves marks all over the floor.\n\nI hate nasty, sweaty footprints. I told her to clean it up and don't forget her slippers again and I grounded her for the weekend. She started crying and telling me that everyone in her class is allowed to wear socks at home and touch their walls. I told her I don't care and that I'm not their parents, but I am her parent. I thought that was the end of it, but my sister says I went too far.

You sound psychotic. That\u2019s unhinged behavior. She\u2019s going to grow up to hate you guaranteed. Wearing SOCKS on hardwood is not any more dirty than wearing house slippers\u2026if anything socks are going to be more clean since you\u2019re regularly washing them. How often do you wash the slippers? That poor girl. I feel terrible that she has to live with you.", "YTA. You move in, change her entire home, and suddenly she\u2019s not allowed to walk around her own house in a normal way and you expect her to be happy about it? \n\nYou sound pretentious.

It sounds like you have major OCD or cleanliness issues. Your SD shouldn\u2019t have to cry about not being allowed to wear socks or be barefoot and touch the walls in her own home. This is just ludicrous.

As a mother, I came in ready to say the opposite, but WOW. I can't imagine having to put up with the rules you try to enforce. I can't imagine trying to make my child, or ANY child, live with those rules. Honestly, it sounds like you want a house that doesn't appear to have anyone living in it. What she needs is a HOME. Homes have prints on the wall sometimes.", "this seems a bit over the top, houses are meant to be lived in, not decoration pieces. not wearing shoes in the house i totally understand, but being barefoot or wearing socks is fine unless shes tracking mud all over the floors. not touching the walls is ridiculous, what kind of walls do you have that get significantly dirty from fingerprints? \n\nYTA for expecting your SD to conform to your ridiculous standards.", "YTA with ridiculously high cleanliness standards for a 12 year old. If her father is allowing you to treat her like this, he's TA too.", "YTA, shes 12 and a child, fingerprints and sweat marks?

A child living in her own home is being punished for not being perfect and keeping things insanely pristine because you happen to like it that way.

Nothing wrong with a clean house and everyone should have chores.   But the no bare feet and no socks cracks me up.  It's obvious you only care about appearances and not the child. It's most likely a good thing you don't have children of your own.  I would pity any baby you raised.  You'd most likely ground them if they drooled on your precious floor. You call yourself her parent but you're not acting like it. Everything in your message is all about you.  I did this, I did that, ME ME ME.  I'm sure the child feels it too. How about acting like a loving step parent instead of a Stepford robot. Keep it up and pretty soon you'll be getting the \"You're not my mom\" speech and at that point you can write off any healthy relationship with her. Where is her dad in all of this?", "YTA why would you choose this hill to die on in regards to building a strong and lasting relationship with the daughter of the man you love?\nYou moved in, changed everything about her house and started calling it your house, then implemented strict yet ridiculous rules about socks and bare feet. Just, dumb doesn't even come close to explaining what you are. \n\nA dirty floor can always be cleaned but a damaged relationship can't always be repaired.\n\nI hope when push comes to shove your husband chooses his daughter over you, then you can live in a house with no sweaty footprints, all alone.", "Having someone come over and deep clean your house every week is excessive. I, too, like a clean house, but I also have a life that means I have to compromise on just how clean I can keep my house. Leaving footprints from just sweaty, bare feet is nothing. Touching walls with clean fingers is nothing (I have a hard time believing that your step daughters fingers are constantly coated in grime).\n\nThe narrative I'm getting from this is you are an utter clean freak and you're pushing your unreasonably high standards of cleanliness onto a child. You need to relax and accept that some mess is going to happen  especially if people are *living* in the house. YTA.", "YTA I love a clean home too, but this is over the top. Sweaty footprints on the hardwood floors, really? If her feet and her socks are clean this isn't really an issue. Fingerprints on the walls? If she washes her hands on a regular basis this shouldn't be an issue either. Shame on you if you didn't get washable paint in a home with a child. \n\nIf you have a cleaning service coming every week, how dirty can the house be getting from a child walking around in socks and bare feet? Your home has people living in it. It's not a museum. \n\nYour SD is not doing anything out of the ordinary for a child. This is not the willful defiance of purposefully leaving messes or destroying things. You need to tone it down or she will resent you and it will damage your relationship.", "YTA, jesus, she's 12, of course she hates to clean and you sound so over the top. It is NOT normal to throw a fit about someone walking around in socks, and absurd to GROUND her. Is this real?", "YTA. You boast about how you raised the value of the house, but you decreased the value of a positive relationship with SD. You changed HER ROOM to meet your tastes. That's gross. You're not a good person and you need to get checked for how clean you need this place to be. That's coming from someone who is a neat freak. You're not a neat freak. You're something else entirely.

Do you live in a house or a museum?

I'm normally not one to butt heads with a child, but she just will not give this one up.\n\n5 years ago, I moved in with SD and her father. We live in SD's childhood home. It was ugly and outdated when I moved in and since then I have greatly increased our resell value. One of the main things we did was tearing up most of the flooring and laying down hardwood floor. Now, I'm sure most of you know that hardwood requires a lot of care to maintain, and I work hard to keep things clean.\n\nSD does not like to keep this clean. She hates doing the dishes and laundry. She hates dusting the house. She hates vacuuming. She hates cleaning. I, on the other hand, like to have a clean home, and their house was absolutely not up to my cleanliness standards when I moved in.\n\nHere's the issue: I have rules for SD that she doesn't like. One of them is no touching the walls because fingers leave dirty trail/grease marks. Another is no shoes, socks, or bare feet on the floor. We all have house slippers to wear. \n\nWe have a cleaner that comes once a week and deep cleans the entire house. This includes mopping the floors. I'm very proud of how spotless the kitchen floors are, but SD is constantly forgetting her slippers and leaving them in her room. Yesterday, I woke up to find that she had been in the kitchen in her socks, because I could see the footprints from her sweaty sock on the floor. I called her down to look at it and she forgot her slippers then too! She was barefoot when she can see how that leaves marks all over the floor.\n\nI hate nasty, sweaty footprints. I told her to clean it up and don't forget her slippers again and I grounded her for the weekend. She started crying and telling me that everyone in her class is allowed to wear socks at home and touch their walls. I told her I don't care and that I'm not their parents, but I am her parent. I thought that was the end of it, but my sister says I went too far. AITA?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I don't see sock or foot marks on mine and only clean them once a week. .  \n\nYour house needs to be a home; a place where your family feels comfortable and welcome. 12 year olds can be messy and difficult, but you're setting your SD up for failure with these onerous rules.", "She's. 12.

I've never sweated in my socks unless I'm at Disneyland or Disney World walking all day. Even then they're relatively dry. What does this kid do that she always has sweaty socks or sweaty feet? I think you're vastly overreacting about the foot thing. She should be able to walk around in clean pair of socks in the house at all times. I would just ask her when she comes home to change her socks and make sure it's a fresh pair when she's walking around. I like to go Barefoot everywhere. I get you want to keep your house clean but you are going way too far and being way too militant. I gather you have some OCD about cleanliness as well. You need to chill out a bit.

It sounds like all you're focused on is the financial aspect of things, seeing as you worry about wire hangers ruining clothes, \"sweaty\" floors, and the resale value of the home. I could see why you'd be a touch careful about the value of the house if you were gonna sell it within the next year, but I highly doubt that.   \n\n\nA home is not based on how much it will sell. It's based on how well you live there, and how comfortable all of its occupants are. ALL of its occupants. If none of you, especially the 12 year old, can't live there comfortably without fear of repercussion then it's not a home. It's a nightmare. How on earth her bio parent allows you to get away with this is beyond me.   \n\n\n....If you're so concerned about keeping things clean, why don't you do them yourself?", "Yta.

Should have went with wood laminate and then you wouldn\u2019t see the footprints and it\u2019s easier to maintain and often sturdier.

I was prepared to read a story about big sticky messes or pizza on the carpet or never cleaning up her craft supplies or something. But you\u2019re going waaaaay overboard here. Get a Swiffer and run around with it every evening, (you not her, because you\u2019re the one who\u2019s bothered by this totally normal wear and tear) and let the kid run around barefoot and with socks. There will be zero lasting damage. I get the shoes thing because you can track gravel in and scratch the floor, but the rest is just unreasonable. And I almost get the wall thing and that should be an easier one to avoid, but realistically if you\u2019re gonna live in the house longer for one or two more years, you\u2019re probably gonna have to repaint anyway. Do a coat of primer, two coats of regular paint. It\u2019s not that hard, I just did my whole house. And I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to constantly bring my stepdaughter down because I have perfection issues. You can still turn this ship around, but the only way is going to be to let some of this inconsequential stuff go.", "YTA. She\u2019s a child. Your rules are unreasonable and frankly, it sounds like you may have mental health issues that would benefit from therapy and medication. You came into HER home.

You are complaining about stupid stuff that you need to get over. I agree that your step daughter needs to help with the chores but she is 12 and is going to hate doing it.
