I am working a serving job at a mid level restaurant (bills typically 100 for drinks, food, appetizers, dessert for 2 people). I have been working here for 10 months. My parents usually come in every friday with my uncle and aunt. They are usually sat in my section and they tip me extremely well (~200$ bill and 100 tip) just because they\u2019re my family. My manager has no issue with this as i do not give them extras/more attention i just treat them like a normal customer. He is aware of the tip and my parents will usually order drinks at the bar and tip the bar tender as well so they spend a lot here. He knows them and talks with them when they are here because he appreciates their business.\n\nUnfortunately my manger is out because his wife is sick so he is on leave for 6 months. We have a temporary manager named Barb. Barb is very strict and follows the rules. Barb has been here for 2 weeks and has seen my parents twice and she asked me the second time. When i told her it was my parents she made a weird face. I should also note i have a coworker named Tina who hates that i serve my parents and get a huge tip. She was always complaining to my old manager but he never cared. \n\nCut to last friday my parents come in. This was essentially my cousin\u2019s engagement dinner and also my birthday is soon so i know they were planning on leaving me a huge tip as a present. I haven\u2019t seen my cousin or my grandpa in awhile and they were all excited to be served by me. I was talking about this all week and talking about how i knew i was getting 500$ as a tip because it\u2019s my birthday soon. The hostesses know them as well and goes to sit them in my section. Barb immediately intercepts this and tells the hostess to sit them in Tina\u2019s section. Not only was this my parents but my aunt and uncle, cousin and her bf, and my grandpa. I ask Barb if i can serve my family and she says she is sick of me being unprofessional and i am hogging the tips away from the other servers who deserve it aswell. Tina sees this and is very happy. My family gets sat in her section however my dad asks if i can serve them but Barb says \u201cOP has some other responsibilities to tend to and wouldn\u2019t be able to give you her full attention\u201d My parents are confused and i shrug behind my manager. My mom goes to find me half way into their meal and i tell her what happened. Cut to the end their bill is around $350~. And Tina is left 65$ as a tip. My parents leave and after the restaurant  closes Tina corners me and screams at me that i cost her 500$. Barb steps in and accuses me of telling my parents not to tip Tina. I try to explain this was a present and Barb scoffs and calls me a liar. \n\nI left and i don\u2019t work until tomorrow. I feel like an asshole because i bet she was really excited to get the huge tip. I am afraid to go back in as people have been talking about it.

While your NTA, you were kind of bragging that was your upcoming tip and obviously Tina wanted that tip. She still got tipped well but not the $500.

You mentioned you knew you were going to get a huge tip as part of a birthday gift. You made the mistake by mentioning it, and they made the mistake by wanting to give you a birthday gift as part of a business transaction in the form of a tip. Don't get me wrong, your coworker and substitute manager made mistakes as well, that could've costed the business some money as well. I've seen customers that know what server they'd get and specifically want them, only to be told in one manner or another they couldn't. Rather than sitting with said different server, the customers leave, so now no server gets tipped, and the business loses out on a sale.", "NTA but I\u2019d stop bragging about \u00a3500 tips to your co-workers.

To be honest, your family using your workplace to give you a present isn\u2019t the best idea to begin with. Those kinds of things are better done in private. \n\nShe\u2019s an asshole for getting it into her head that she would be treated the same as you, their own child.

Your folks/family shouldn\u2019t be denied the right to enjoy their time with you as their server, and you are entitled to them wanting to be awesome and generous\u2026but considering these issues, a light smattering of discretion might ensure everyone gets what they want, and you\u2019re not dealing with douchey people.

Barb is the worst kind of manager and Tina... The entitlement. Wow.", "ESH, you shouldn\u2019t have shot off your mouth about an anticipated big tip.  Barb should have just sat your family in your section.  If there were issues with your professionalism Barb should have spoken to you or formally written you up.  Tina was delusional to expect your family to tip her the same.  \n\nIf it comes up, just say, you got @20% tip, why are you complaining?

They did short her a little but only by about $5. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t understand why your parents don\u2019t just give you your birthday money as a present separately. Why are you making such a big to-do over how much your family tips you when they come and why go on for a week that you know they\u2019re tipping you $500 when they come. You\u2019re partially to blame here. You helped to create the animosity against you.", "NTA. Tina and Barb are *completely deluded* if they think that your family regularly drops hundreds of dollars in tips for any reason other than they are giving *you* money.\n\nThe tip was *never* available for anyone but you because, as you pointed out, they aren't really tipping you, they're giving you a gift. I'm honestly kind of hoping that this is fake because the idea that people could be this stupid as well as so AH-ish makes my heart hurt for humanity.", "Nta. What your parents choose to tip is ultimately up to them. Im sure tina and barb arent that ignorant as to assume your parents were going to tip her excessively because they do their own child? Go to work and tell them their level of entitlment and delusion make for great post karma.", "Info: Why did she expect $500 as a tip?", "NTA\n\nEveryone is so blind with their jealousy  they couldn't realize you weren't getting large tips because they tip like to everyone, but because they're your parents and family. That is not your problem and don't feel guilty.", "I say NTA. Though, in most businesses, I think that taking care of your family is frowned upon, and usually deterred, so I can see why your new manager and your co-worker might be a bit salty. Especially as they might be jealous of the generous tips you get. \n\nHowever, your other manager let it slide and it's not your fault that your family tips you well. And it's not your fault that your family was unhappy to have their usual arrangement changed, and only tip the appropriate amount. Your co-worker isn't ENTITLED to the $500 tip. She got a tip. That's something. She can't be mad at you because they didn't tip her the amount she was hoping for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I do have to ask though, if these are gifts from your family why do they give them to you as tips? Couldn't they give you the money another time or transfer it to you bank account/venmo/paypal/etc?", "NTA\n\nYou didn\u2019t cost Tina anything. She is extremely entitled to think YOUR family would tip her as much as they tip you. Barb is just an asshole and pretty stupid. Your family are customers who spend a lot in the restaurant she manage, and she treated them badly for really no reason. She should be thrilled that they come in so regularly, spend a lot, and tip well.", "NTA it's perfectly common to tip more to friends & family. My brother was a server for years and if we showed during a shift we sat in his section and gave extra as did every coworkers family.", "This is all wrong! Your parents are doing this because you are their child. It\u2019s part of their caring for you. \n\nLook at it like this: Would your parents take Tina into their home and care for her? I think not. So, it\u2019s the same with the tip. It wasn\u2019t JUST A TIP. Like you said: It was A GIFT. Well, they wouldn\u2019t just take a gift they bought for you and give it to someone they don\u2019t even know, just because someone else (manager) made a change\u2026\n\nOf course not\u2026this is why it is wrong! It was YOUR GIFT not Tina\u2019s. They would have NEVER given Tina such a tip, especially on a $350 bill. That\u2019s just stupid.\n\nLets say it was a diamond or pearl necklace they bought for you. They planned to give it to you at your job, as part of a celebration with other family there. If manager inserted herself and said: \u201cNo, I think Tina should be given the necklace, and NOT your daughter!\u201d Would they do as she said? Even so, they still gave Tina more than a 15% tip\u2026so they were not unfair to her, even though the manager ruined their celebration and expectations ended up in disappointment.\n\nNext time keep your trap shut, don\u2019t tell anyone. You are dealing with jealous narcissists: Both Tina and this manager. As long as they don\u2019t know the plan, or anything about what your parents are planning to do, they cannot sabotage it. So now it just falls to you to keep quiet about anything to do with your family and your personal business. I\u2019m sorry you had to learn this way, but now you know that when people know about your financial business, even in this way, they try to take advantage and steal from you. And yes this was an effort to steal from you! Steal your tip. It\u2019s best you learned this through this experience, because these are petty thefts, and there are much bigger sharks out there who will try to rip you off in every way possible. Keep your business to yourself, because if they don\u2019t know you have money or anything else, they will not target you to rip you off.", "Nta but stop talking about your tips. At best it\u2019s tacky, at worst. It causes problems you have now.    It\u2019s nobody\u2019s business how much you make so grow up and keep your mouth shut.    You have fabulous parents.!!!!!!!", "\"Tina corners me and screams at me that I cost her 500$...\" No, you didn't. They only tip you that much because you are family. They would never tip someone who isn't family that kind of money. Tina is not family, so she gets a standard tip.   \nThat being said, you need to keep quiet about your tips. Or maybe your parents could tip you outside of work. It isn't anyone's business but yours, but why inflame the situation?", "NTA, but Barb sure is for refusing to seat a call table in their preferred section. As you pointed out, your parents spend a lot of money there and should not have been used as pawns in her petty power play games.

It was never a tip. They were just giving their kid some money. That's fine. No problems.

Tina still got tipped 18% which is standard. Also, wtf can\u2019t your family just give you the cash at home it avoids the drama? I get they are trying to be nice but this obv is an issue with the rest of the staff. It also kind of shows that since your family can afford a $500 tip you aren\u2019t exactly in as much of a survival / need mode as the rest of the staff. I would also explain that you get tipped exceptionally well because they are friends / family. You don\u2019t ask them to tip you extra or interfere in how they chose to tip if someone else is waiting their table.", "NTA, both manager and Tina sound delusional, that being said there's definitely a lesson here in keeping money comments to yourself.", "How stupid are these people? If they can't see that your parents give you these tips BECAUSE they're your parents, and that anyone else would only get a normal tip, there's a big old chunk of cognitive ability missing in their brains.\n\nOne question, if this tipping has become an issue, why can't your parents give you a tip privately, away from the restaurant?\n\nNTA, you literally didn't do the thing you're asking about.", "NTA\n\nThat said, your family should just give you money separately to avoid stuff like this.  All it does is build resentment in your workplace.", "NTA you didn\u2019t cost Tina $500 because your parents were never going to tip another server that much. They tip you that much because you are family. It\u2019s strange that they are giving you your presents through tips. You have to pay taxes on your tips.

Don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s sweet that your family want to be served by you but it is inappropriate. Your coworker is an idiot if she believes that she\u2019s going to receive the same tip as you from them though, does she believe that they are just tipping everyone like they tip you?", "NTA Because your coworker was never promised a tip, but having worked in hospitality for 10+ years, it\u2019s not very cool carrying this on. You are causing drama by bragging about your tips, and getting special treatment by having your family regularly in your section, and then getting the benefits from that. \n\nAny outsider would see this in hospitality and think you\u2019re sorting out your family\u2019s experience by giving them extra, and they\u2019re paying you a larger tip to compensate.
