I am working a serving job at a mid level restaurant (bills typically 100 for drinks, food, appetizers, dessert for 2 people). I have been working here for 10 months. My parents usually come in every friday with my uncle and aunt. They are usually sat in my section and they tip me extremely well (~200$ bill and 100 tip) just because they\u2019re my family. My manager has no issue with this as i do not give them extras/more attention i just treat them like a normal customer. He is aware of the tip and my parents will usually order drinks at the bar and tip the bar tender as well so they spend a lot here. He knows them and talks with them when they are here because he appreciates their business.\n\nUnfortunately my manger is out because his wife is sick so he is on leave for 6 months. We have a temporary manager named Barb. Barb is very strict and follows the rules. Barb has been here for 2 weeks and has seen my parents twice and she asked me the second time. When i told her it was my parents she made a weird face. I should also note i have a coworker named Tina who hates that i serve my parents and get a huge tip. She was always complaining to my old manager but he never cared. \n\nCut to last friday my parents come in. This was essentially my cousin\u2019s engagement dinner and also my birthday is soon so i know they were planning on leaving me a huge tip as a present. I haven\u2019t seen my cousin or my grandpa in awhile and they were all excited to be served by me. I was talking about this all week and talking about how i knew i was getting 500$ as a tip because it\u2019s my birthday soon. The hostesses know them as well and goes to sit them in my section. Barb immediately intercepts this and tells the hostess to sit them in Tina\u2019s section. Not only was this my parents but my aunt and uncle, cousin and her bf, and my grandpa. I ask Barb if i can serve my family and she says she is sick of me being unprofessional and i am hogging the tips away from the other servers who deserve it aswell. Tina sees this and is very happy. My family gets sat in her section however my dad asks if i can serve them but Barb says \u201cOP has some other responsibilities to tend to and wouldn\u2019t be able to give you her full attention\u201d My parents are confused and i shrug behind my manager. My mom goes to find me half way into their meal and i tell her what happened. Cut to the end their bill is around $350~. And Tina is left 65$ as a tip. My parents leave and after the restaurant  closes Tina corners me and screams at me that i cost her 500$. Barb steps in and accuses me of telling my parents not to tip Tina. I try to explain this was a present and Barb scoffs and calls me a liar. \n\nI left and i don\u2019t work until tomorrow. I feel like an asshole because i bet she was really excited to get the huge tip. I am afraid to go back in as people have been talking about it.

It's obvious that they tip you better because you're family, why the heck would Tina expect to be treated the same? NTA", "Weird question: how come your family can't give you the $500 out of work? While your NTA, you were kind of bragging that was your upcoming tip and obviously Tina wanted that tip. She still got tipped well but not the $500. Keep those money comments to yourself unless you want to be stuck in an uneasy situation like this. Before I forget,  Tina and temp manager were probably in on it because I find it funny she intercepted the day they came in.", "NTA\n\nThey tip you bigger because they are YOUR family.\nWhy would the other girl expect the same treatment.\nMaybe their family should come in and they can be their server and get the tip", "NTA. Ask Tina if her parents are going to give you her birthday money. \nIt is not a 100 tip for a 200 Dollar dinner. It is a normal tip and some gift money. Very simple. \nBarb and Tina are some special type of dense", "NTA Barb and Tina seem to be scheming against you. You should tell Barb in front of the owner that since your family can\u2019t be served by you they will not be coming around anymore, let\u2019s see how much the owner and barb like that.", "NTA\n\nShe really expected to get your birthday present instead of you? Gimme a break..", "NTA.   However,  you've learned a valuable lesson.   Never boast about money to co-workers.   You've seen first hand how nasty things can become.    What your family tipped you was no one's business but yours and theirs.   And if it's causing problems at your work .. tell them to tip you normally and see you outside of work to shower you with a $500.00 birthday gift.", "Tina and Barb are worse, but ESH.\n\n>i have a coworker named Tina who hates that i serve my parents and get a huge tip.  \n>  \n>I was talking about this all week and talking about how i knew i was getting 500$ as a tip because it\u2019s my birthday soon.\n\nYou knew your coworker was sensitive and your manager was an ass, and rubbed it in all week anyway.", "NTA. But...\n\nWhile I wouldn't care if you served your own family or not, your family did make a pretty dumb mistake. And with it, you did as well. You mentioned you knew you were going to get a huge tip as part of a birthday gift. You made the mistake by mentioning it, and they made the mistake by wanting to give you a birthday gift as part of a business transaction in the form of a tip. Don't get me wrong, your coworker and substitute manager made mistakes as well, that could've costed the business some money as well. I've seen customers that know what server they'd get and specifically want them, only to be told in one manner or another they couldn't. Rather than sitting with said different server, the customers leave, so now no server gets tipped, and the business loses out on a sale.", "NTA but I\u2019d stop bragging about \u00a3500 tips to your co-workers. You\u2019re only getting tips that large because it\u2019s your parents, not because you\u2019re providing better service. It\u2019s great your parents want to supplement your wages but could they not do it another way?\n\nEdit to finish comment, hit enter too soon.", "NTA. your parents gave her over 15%. They are stupid because it was obvious your parents were tipping that high because it was you. Has you not spoken to your mom they would still tip that 65, maybe even less", "NTA\n\nTina is just jealous. Took her $500 tip? No she took your family even though both you and your fam planned on having you as their server. Tina got tipped appropriately.", "NTA.  You have no control over tip received.", "Going against the grain to say ESH. \n\nIt\u2019s absolutely not your fault Tina didn\u2019t get $500, that makes sense. It\u2019s also not your family\u2019s responsibility to tip a stranger that kind of money or to \u201cfollow through\u201d on something she wrongly assumed she was entitled to. Tina and Barb are delusional. \n\nThat said, you shouldn\u2019t have bragged about your good fortune at work. Everyone there is trying to make a living. To be honest, your family using your workplace to give you a present isn\u2019t the best idea to begin with. Those kinds of things are better done in private. \n\nShe\u2019s an asshole for getting it into her head that she would be treated the same as you, their own child. You\u2019re an asshole for bragging about a large public tip that your family should\u2019ve extended to you privately, as a gift, in the first place.", "That\u2019s a hot, steaming load of bullshit. Patrons are allowed to tip however they see fit\u2026and they are also allowed to request a specific server or section. \n\nThat said\u2026it might be a better idea for your folks/family to start just kinda sliding you these larger amounts of money under the literal/proverbial table and tipping as they would anyone else\u2026or simply find another way to display their generosity outside work where it\u2019s not going to be misconstrued by any asshat coworkers or Barb the Barbarian. Your folks/family shouldn\u2019t be denied the right to enjoy their time with you as their server, and you are entitled to them wanting to be awesome and generous\u2026but considering these issues, a light smattering of discretion might ensure everyone gets what they want, and you\u2019re not dealing with douchey people. Definitely NTA.", "Does Tina think she's family? Girl really thought your family would tip her like that? Lol. You're NTA. The tip is literally staying in the family.", "NTA wtf planet do Barb and Tina live on that they think she'd get the exact same treatment as your parent's daughter???", "NTA... Barb is the worst kind of manager and Tina... The entitlement. Wow.", "ESH, you shouldn\u2019t have shot off your mouth about an anticipated big tip.  Barb should have just sat your family in your section.  If there were issues with your professionalism Barb should have spoken to you or formally written you up.  Tina was delusional to expect your family to tip her the same.  \n\nIf it comes up, just say, you got @20% tip, why are you complaining?  I wouldn\u2019t expect your family to overtip me, why do you expect my family to overtip you?", "ESH- I mean she didn\u2019t actually lose a $500 dollar tip because no one tips the waitress more than the bill unless they\u2019re loaded or family. They did short her a little but only by about $5. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t understand why your parents don\u2019t just give you your birthday money as a present separately. Why are you making such a big to-do over how much your family tips you when they come and why go on for a week that you know they\u2019re tipping you $500 when they come. You\u2019re partially to blame here. You helped to create the animosity against you.", "NTA. Tina and Barb are *completely deluded* if they think that your family regularly drops hundreds of dollars in tips for any reason other than they are giving *you* money.\n\nThe tip was *never* available for anyone but you because, as you pointed out, they aren't really tipping you, they're giving you a gift. I'm honestly kind of hoping that this is fake because the idea that people could be this stupid as well as so AH-ish makes my heart hurt for humanity.", "Nta. What your parents choose to tip is ultimately up to them. Im sure tina and barb arent that ignorant as to assume your parents were going to tip her excessively because they do their own child? Go to work and tell them their level of entitlment and delusion make for great post karma.", "Info: Why did she expect $500 as a tip?", "NTA\n\nEveryone is so blind with their jealousy  they couldn't realize you weren't getting large tips because they tip like to everyone, but because they're your parents and family. That is not your problem and don't feel guilty.", "I say NTA. Though, in most businesses, I think that taking care of your family is frowned upon, and usually deterred, so I can see why your new manager and your co-worker might be a bit salty. Especially as they might be jealous of the generous tips you get. \n\nHowever, your other manager let it slide and it's not your fault that your family tips you well. And it's not your fault that your family was unhappy to have their usual arrangement changed, and only tip the appropriate amount. Your co-worker isn't ENTITLED to the $500 tip. She got a tip. That's something. She can't be mad at you because they didn't tip her the amount she was hoping for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Why don't they just give you the money rather than pretending its a tip!\n\nThe hostess job is to rotate tables and I don't know how large that party is but it likely involved more than a 4 top,  If you needed tables from another persons section ,would you have split the $500  'tip'?\n\nYour family come to your place of work and flash money in a strange fashion it would be best if it stopped. They tipped your colleage less than 20% which is cheap, particuarly since you work there.\n\nYou didn't cost your colleague the money.

While it\u2019s absolutely lovely that OPs family want to offer them financial support, and support the business where they work, surely it\u2019s more appropriate to tip as they would normally (as they did with Tina), and gift OP privately.
