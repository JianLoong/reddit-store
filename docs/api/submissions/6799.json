I am working a serving job at a mid level restaurant (bills typically 100 for drinks, food, appetizers, dessert for 2 people). I have been working here for 10 months. My parents usually come in every friday with my uncle and aunt. They are usually sat in my section and they tip me extremely well (~200$ bill and 100 tip) just because they\u2019re my family. My manager has no issue with this as i do not give them extras/more attention i just treat them like a normal customer. He is aware of the tip and my parents will usually order drinks at the bar and tip the bar tender as well so they spend a lot here. He knows them and talks with them when they are here because he appreciates their business.\n\nUnfortunately my manger is out because his wife is sick so he is on leave for 6 months. We have a temporary manager named Barb. Barb is very strict and follows the rules. Barb has been here for 2 weeks and has seen my parents twice and she asked me the second time. When i told her it was my parents she made a weird face. I should also note i have a coworker named Tina who hates that i serve my parents and get a huge tip. She was always complaining to my old manager but he never cared. \n\nCut to last friday my parents come in. This was essentially my cousin\u2019s engagement dinner and also my birthday is soon so i know they were planning on leaving me a huge tip as a present. I haven\u2019t seen my cousin or my grandpa in awhile and they were all excited to be served by me. I was talking about this all week and talking about how i knew i was getting 500$ as a tip because it\u2019s my birthday soon. The hostesses know them as well and goes to sit them in my section. Barb immediately intercepts this and tells the hostess to sit them in Tina\u2019s section. Not only was this my parents but my aunt and uncle, cousin and her bf, and my grandpa. I ask Barb if i can serve my family and she says she is sick of me being unprofessional and i am hogging the tips away from the other servers who deserve it aswell. Tina sees this and is very happy. My family gets sat in her section however my dad asks if i can serve them but Barb says \u201cOP has some other responsibilities to tend to and wouldn\u2019t be able to give you her full attention\u201d My parents are confused and i shrug behind my manager. My mom goes to find me half way into their meal and i tell her what happened. Cut to the end their bill is around $350~. And Tina is left 65$ as a tip. My parents leave and after the restaurant  closes Tina corners me and screams at me that i cost her 500$. Barb steps in and accuses me of telling my parents not to tip Tina. I try to explain this was a present and Barb scoffs and calls me a liar. \n\nI left and i don\u2019t work until tomorrow. I feel like an asshole because i bet she was really excited to get the huge tip. I am afraid to go back in as people have been talking about it.

You mentioned you knew you were going to get a huge tip as part of a birthday gift. You made the mistake by mentioning it, and they made the mistake by wanting to give you a birthday gift as part of a business transaction in the form of a tip. Don't get me wrong, your coworker and substitute manager made mistakes as well, that could've costed the business some money as well. I've seen customers that know what server they'd get and specifically want them, only to be told in one manner or another they couldn't. Rather than sitting with said different server, the customers leave, so now no server gets tipped, and the business loses out on a sale.", "NTA but I\u2019d stop bragging about \u00a3500 tips to your co-workers.

Those kinds of things are better done in private. \n\nShe\u2019s an asshole for getting it into her head that she would be treated the same as you, their own child.

Your folks/family shouldn\u2019t be denied the right to enjoy their time with you as their server, and you are entitled to them wanting to be awesome and generous\u2026but considering these issues, a light smattering of discretion might ensure everyone gets what they want, and you\u2019re not dealing with douchey people.

Barb is the worst kind of manager and Tina... The entitlement. Wow.", "ESH, you shouldn\u2019t have shot off your mouth about an anticipated big tip.  Barb should have just sat your family in your section.  If there were issues with your professionalism Barb should have spoken to you or formally written you up.  Tina was delusional to expect your family to tip her the same.  \n\nIf it comes up, just say, you got @20% tip, why are you complaining?

They did short her a little but only by about $5. \n\nHowever, I don\u2019t understand why your parents don\u2019t just give you your birthday money as a present separately. Why are you making such a big to-do over how much your family tips you when they come and why go on for a week that you know they\u2019re tipping you $500 when they come. You\u2019re partially to blame here. You helped to create the animosity against you.", "NTA. Tina and Barb are *completely deluded* if they think that your family regularly drops hundreds of dollars in tips for any reason other than they are giving *you* money.\n\nThe tip was *never* available for anyone but you because, as you pointed out, they aren't really tipping you, they're giving you a gift. I'm honestly kind of hoping that this is fake because the idea that people could be this stupid as well as so AH-ish makes my heart hurt for humanity.", "Nta. What your parents choose to tip is ultimately up to them. Im sure tina and barb arent that ignorant as to assume your parents were going to tip her excessively because they do their own child? Go to work and tell them their level of entitlment and delusion make for great post karma.", "Info: Why did she expect $500 as a tip?", "NTA\n\nEveryone is so blind with their jealousy  they couldn't realize you weren't getting large tips because they tip like to everyone, but because they're your parents and family. That is not your problem and don't feel guilty.", "I say NTA. Though, in most businesses, I think that taking care of your family is frowned upon, and usually deterred, so I can see why your new manager and your co-worker might be a bit salty. Especially as they might be jealous of the generous tips you get. \n\nHowever, your other manager let it slide and it's not your fault that your family tips you well. And it's not your fault that your family was unhappy to have their usual arrangement changed, and only tip the appropriate amount. Your co-worker isn't ENTITLED to the $500 tip. She got a tip. That's something. She can't be mad at you because they didn't tip her the amount she was hoping for.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

I get the parents are trying to be supportive by tipping big but it comes off as YTA when you brag about it and talk about it to everyone especially when they only do it because you are their child not because that\u2019s just the way they tip.

Not because \"he cost his coworker 500 dollars\", because he didn't, but the whole situation is very \"entitled assholish\".\n\nYou have a weird deal with with your parents where they gift you large amounts of money, which is well enough, but you absolutely shouldn't make it part of your job, especially to the point where you are telling everyone about it and making it seem like it's a \"tip\" similar to what other people get.\n\nIt's also really assholish to talk about these big tips because if it was say a legitimate tip from a stranger,  something that large would often be split among other staff members like back of house.  \n\nBottom line, op is taking gift from his parents and pretending it's part of their regular income, and bragging about it to everyone he works with.

My parents are solid 10% tippers- unless I am with them, and then I make them do 20, or I supplement (at this point, I just pay for everything as they are getting on in years). But when I waited tables, they tipped me 25-50% if they sat in my section, which, as host and servers, we ALL tried to do for each other.  How is this different than having regulars?  Regulars type servers THEY KNOW better than random- because we know their preferences, have a relationship, etc. This manager is a NUT job, and Tina is clearly new to serving.", "Yeah, I don't get why OP felt the need to brag about it either.

Tina is an AH for whining before and after getting the table. It\u2019s crazy she thought she was going to get a huge tip. Of course you are getting that tip because it is your family.

If a customer requests a specific server they should usually try to be accommodated. There are exceptions of course, a rotation to share large parties, if the server is giving them freebies, if the server is serving minors, etc. It doesn\u2019t seem like that is a problem here, so the manager should have accommodated the guest\u2019s request if possible (also a lot better for future business). \n\n3.

Your colleagues for whom this IS their permanent job can probably sense the disrespect radiating right off you and your family. This disrespect is compounded by you bragging about your gift which is made PUBLICLY as a show. Like really? Learn to read the room. Your colleagues who are likely working to make ends meet to raise their kids, pay rent, etc. think you\u2019re a spoiled brat. To be honest, you probably are since you don\u2019t have the social tact to realize that rubbing your family\u2019s gift in the face of working class people is extremely rude. \n\nThis may be a temporary job for you until you get your degree, but you should learn some empathy before entering the work force.", "ESH\n\nOP, you\u2019re flaunting your family\u2019s wealth in everyone\u2019s face. Your parents are giving you 3-400 a month in tips on top of a huge bill. Everyone knows you don\u2019t need the tip, your parents wouldn\u2019t let you go homeless. You are also pretending you worked to earn the money which you really didn\u2019t.\n\nNew manager fucked up a good thing. May not have known it\u2019s your parents but is right that it\u2019s very unprofessional. That said, restaurants tend to make allowances and such. Also they sound like great customers. Barb and Tina are either incredibly stupid or didn\u2019t understand they were your family, I don\u2019t know. But their interference probably lost the restaurant good will and customers when you switch jobs", "Yes, OP erred in talking about the prospective huge tip ALL WEEK. But Barb and Tina are bigger AHs. I worked many years in restaurants and we always had regular customers who preferred to sit in a certain section every time. Some were good tippers, some weren't. Those were the breaks. But we never forced those customers to sit elsewhere; otherwise they might get upset and choose not to return. The fact the regular customers are her relatives is just another layer to the situation. I have generously tipped friends and family members who were waitstaff simply because they were friends or family. I don't think that is weird at all. \n\nWhere Barb REALLY erred is in treating regular customers as if they don't have the right to sit where they want. The parents were like any other regular customer who wanted to sit in a certain person's section. A manager should honor that. And for her and Tina to not grasp the concept that OP gets a more generous tip because it is her family is ludicrous.", "Hey OP,  in the future if your parents want to gift you money (such as birthday money) they should do so outside of work, because at work you have to claim that money and pay taxes on it. It doesn't make sense to give gift money as a tip. They can still tip you well when they come in but something like a birthday gift of cash should be done outside of work.\n\nAlso, bragging about how your parents come and tip you well beyond the standard is bound to make your coworkers feel some type of way. Long time ago I worked with a kid who not only lived at home and had his parents pay for everything he needed, but they also came into the restaurant and tipped him a minimum of 100$ once a week. He would brag about it, and all it did was make everyone not like him for shoving his privilege in everyone's face. Bragging about how his parents gave him all that money was just a slap in the face to everyone who didn't have that kind of support and were struggling to make ends meet. It's awesome that your parents want to support you, but be mindful of flaunting that privilege as there are many others out there who do not have that.", "Not to mention, unless they are tipping cash, Op has to pay taxes on it, because the restaurant will report her credit card tips on her w-2. Seems like a super dumb way to handle things. And even if they tip cash, she is supposed to claim it, though I know most servers don\u2019t/wouldn\u2019t.", "\n>Of *course* your colleagues are upset you're hogging these \"big tippers\". Any server who hogs the jackpot tables is *always* an asshole. And it is a thing, and people do watch out for it. \n\nYou're talking as if they would tip Tina or anyone else big numbers lmao It's obvious the just give more money than usual because it's their daughter, they have the right to.", "I was thinking the same thing. They tip her so well because they\u2019re proud and encouraging. It\u2019s actually a little funny too. Tipping her so big even though they could just hand her money at home \ud83d\ude05", "So you agree. ESH. As I said.", "Yes but OP because why would you brag about money with your coworkers? Very bad move", "And jealous coworkers might report her to the IRS for receiving large cash tips on a regular basis...", "Yes - ESH.", "I mean, weren't they basically committing tax fraud? They avoided paying taxes and karma bit them", "They didn\u2019t \u201cget screwed\u201d they screwed the themselves.", "Where I used to work, my manager gave me the option of declaring my tips or not. Anything that came from family was left completely undeclared because frankly, Uncle Sam wasn't gonna take even a smidgen of my family's generous acts of love and thankfully my manager was cool with that.", "My saying they got screwed doesn't in any way take the blame off of them.", "OPPPP, get your gifts as gifts, not as taxable income. And don\u2019t go around boasting about cash gifts at work as if they are earned compensation. You needlessly fostered resentment among your colleagues. \n\nYou didn\u2019t cost Tina a big tip because tips are earned, and neither of you would have actually earned that amount. But the thoughtless bragging makes you sound a bit like an AH.", "Yea, no.\nAs a bookkeeper for more than one restaurant, I can tell you it is normal to tip out based on your tips.", "For bragging about the tips you get from your family, YTA. \nFor the rest of it, ie telling your parents why they got a different server, you\u2019re fine.", "A) It's really weird that your parents have a general practise of giving you gifts as tips rather than just... giving you the gift. \n\nB) Tipping culture is fucking stupid in general. \n\nC) Tina got what sounds like a fairly standard 15% tip.\n\nD) You did nothing wrong.\n\nNTA", "...Don't give presents as tips, wtf. Don't go around talking about how you know you're going to get tipped like crazy (even if it's a present). Even if no one tried to steal your folks' table, they're going to resent the fuck out of you. NTA but you are a dumbass.", "ESH - word of advice, next time don\u2019t go around telling ppl what your family might tip you. Also if your family is tipping you more in general, don\u2019t say anything at all. Zip your lips. Stop telling people your business. What if a coworker hears you bragging about all the money & gets someone to rob you after work. Loose lips sink ships.", "ESH\nThe manager refusing to let you serve your family is kinda petty. No way should Tina have expected your parents to \"tip\" her the same way they \"tip\" you. The extra money your parents give you at work is not a tip, it's a gift, and you shouldn't brag about your parents gifting you money while you're at work. If you're in the US, you should be paying federal tax on the tips you receive. Your parents could easily show up, be served by you, tip you appropriately, and then slip you some cash as a gift.", "Stop being a blabber mouth and Tina & Barb need to stop thinking they should get the family tip rate.", "NTA because your family tips you well, but YTA for gloating about the tips your parents are giving you. It's pretty clear that your restaurant doesn't pool tips, so you telling everyone that \"hey, my parents tip me x amount every time they come in, and I know for sure I'm getting xxx when they come out on Saturday!\" It's just asking for resentment to build. No one should have known what you were getting in the 1st place. People are strange, and if a fellow server KNOWS you're walking out that night with a minimum of $500 in tips (let's me honest, mid scale restaurant probably closer to 700-800 for the night) what's to stop a less than stable coworker to make sure you don't make it home with that money? For everyone that's worked in a restaurant, we all know that one (or more) people that you know is a little off their nut. From here on out, stop talking about your tips with people at work. It's not their business and it's only going to get worse with barb around.", "I have had regulars, and they always tipped really well - but I never bragged to coworkers about my tips either.\n\nThe manager who seated guests in another section was WAY OUT OF LINE! HUGE! It's how you lose customers! \n\nI don't really blame your coworker though, as you have been smug and bragging about generous family. I don't really understand though why she thought their generosity to you would be matched to her. They tipped her well, not crazy though.\n\nRenaud's sour grapes applies here.", "Yea I feel like this is just a huge $500 straw that broke the camels back. \n\nOP was basically receiving weekly $100 tips because their parents were showing up. And although that is great that they are supportive. I can see how the other servers would get tired of OP *always* serving her parents and *always* receiving such a large tip. \n\nThere\u2019s really nothing to do be done about it per se, but OP\u2019s parents should really stop \u201crewarding\u201d OP at work, and OP should stop bragging about it honestly.", "NTA but if Barb tries to keep your parents from your section again I think your parents should complain. The threat of the restaurant losing their business might stop Barb from her weird power trip. I worked as a hostess for many years and we always tried to accommodate guests server/ section/ table requests. Unfortunately it seems like maybe Barb and Tina are friends and she\u2019s trying to help her by trying to hurt you. That\u2019s very unprofessional of Barb", "I majorly disagree with this take. Not everyone will tip their family hundreds of dollars, but you don't think family will tip each other more or want to be served by their family? \n\nWhy do you think the family goes to the restaurant? The new manager is extremely incompetent with clouded judgment treating regular customers like OPs family like that. \n\nHonestly OP deserves a better working environment. They seem to be around toxic people", "What's the point of being rich if you don't flaunt and brag about it?", "Good Lord that is shitty as fuck if that's the case. They're costing the small biz 4.5% credit card charges to tip out and get points for giving their kid money. I figured it was all cash tips. But if they're doing this on credit card I hope the restaurant is somehow getting covered on that. Or they tell them they cannot continue to leave tips that scale on a credit card without paying for charges.. Restaurant margins are crazy slim to begin with.", "LOL :)", "That's bs you said you knew you were getting 500 your acting very bragging. You and your family are being a toxic environment.", "Yep. OP is basically bragging about getting money without actually having to work.", "To be fair I knew as a small kid not to boast about what I got. It\u2019s not even about it backfiring it\u2019s just\u2026 not necessary.", "Yeah, OP comes off as unprofessional in this. I'm surprised that their old manager let this go on for so long because it sounds almost childish.", "I mean everyone else is working at the same place, so I don\u2019t think they\u2019re jealous of OP\u2019s \u201cachievement\u201d", "lol what has op achieved? having rich parents? what an idiotic take.", "That. .. is not the life lesson to be taught here.   Receiving money as a birthday gift from family is not really an achievement lmao. Maybe a better lesson would be to not gloat about how rich your family is. What the other server and manager did was wrong but this is a really stupid way to go about gifting your offspring money. Taxes, resentment of coworkers... its just a bad plan", "Yeah when you phrase it like this it makes sense why Barb had enough resentment that she did what she did\u2026", "Actually they will know how much the tips are because they have to report them as income at the restaurant.  You can be sure Tina will be watching.  Ask your fa", "Yeah I asked this as well. Honestly it\u2019s tacky AF - don\u2019t do that.", "Yeah, no way is OP putting the full amount of her \"family tips\" on her taxes.", "This should be higher up. OP is NTA that Tina didn\u2019t get a giant tip, but OP is a huge asshole for essentially bragging on these tips. I can\u2019t imagine how frustrated I would feel working all night and making probably less than have my coworker doing the same stuff because she happens to come from a more fortunate background. Why don\u2019t these people give her money privately like normal parents who can afford to do so??", "I don\u2019t understand the issue with the parents\u2019 dinners and tips. When I was a server it was very common to have friends, fellow employees, or family come to sit specifically in your section, and they always tipped you well, and you might throw them an extra shot in their drinks or spot them a free app or something, it\u2019s just how the restaurant business works. Unless in the twenty years I\u2019ve been out of that life things have radically changed!", "But you don\u2019t go around saying \u201ccan\u2019t wait for them to tip me $500 for my birthday!\u201d\n\nLike, everyone benefits in a \u2018who you know\u2019 situation, but at the same time, who the fuck looks forward to being tipped after working a large party, because they were told \u201cwe\u2019ll tip you even better\u201d for their birthday a week later? Is OP one of their children or a fucking butler?", "Yeah, I do think it was tacky and unwise for the OP to brag about the money. Otherwise seems normal to me tho.", "YTA because bragging foo, humble down and keep money talks to yourself, nobody cares about your finances and people working there obviously are envious of how \u201ceasy\u201d you got it.\n\nBad OP", "So I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the asshole. I\u2019ve been serving for three years and it\u2019s perfectly reasonable to have your own family and friends sat in your own section. \n\nWith that being said it\u2019s incredibly odd that your parents leave hundreds of dollars in tips a month. Even if you do come from a wealthy family. It seems like they come in an inappropriate amount, not that the money they leave you is owed to anyone else. But still super weird. At that point you didn\u2019t earn that tip, it\u2019s just your parents giving you money at work and making your coworkers feel bad. \n\nNot to offend I think it\u2019s great your family supports you at work, my family\u2019s never visited me at any of my serving jobs. But it\u2019s a little over the top and flashy, just take it down a notch. Normal people don\u2019t have that luxury, so appreciate it humbly.", "\ud83d\ude02", "Yes, they expect us to pay more for the food so that the CEO can buy a new yacht and to increasingly should the burden of paying their employees' wages. As it is, I'm starting to think going out is no longer worth the expense.", "Right, but in that case it's probably best to not keep mentioning it to your coworkers and managers, some of whom are getting pissed off and resentful \ud83e\udd23", "It was bad service. They requested their usual area in the restaurant and were denied it. Plus we don't know if the $350 was before or after tax."]}
