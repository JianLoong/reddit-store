All my life I had never had my own room and I was over due to have my own space. \nI am close with my parents and babysit my siblings (8F and 12M) from time to time, at most around 2 hours. My brother is on the autistic spectrum, but so am I so I know how to handle him the best. My parents usually pay me around $10-20 an hour, so it works out. \nRecently, my mom has gotten a job at a hospital, and has 10 hour shifts. My dad works on a military base, so he isn\u2019t home much either. Before the school year ended for my siblings, they asked if I could babysit when my grandparents couldn\u2019t, Tuesdays mostly. It would be for 6 hours and they\u2019d pay me $10 an hour. I agreed. A week later they asked if I could also babysit Thursdays. A bit of context, I have two jobs, fast food and a bakery, and I work 8 hour shifts 5 days a week. Tuesdays and Thursdays are my only days off. But I agreed, because I\u2019d still be getting paid. Another week passes and they revealed they would only be paying me $100 a month, instead of the $10 an hour I was promised. I tried explaining that would only be $2 an hour and asked they would at least pay me minimum wage, $7 where I live. They said they were upset I was treating this like a job, and said I should be babysitting just because it was family. I tried explaining that I was already busy with my other jobs, and I was babysitting on my only days off, leaving me with no time to myself. They didn\u2019t back down. I told them that I agreed to $10 an hour, and even said I wouldn\u2019t mind getting paid $5 per kid, since I was usually only babysitting one of them at a time anyways. They refused again and called me selfish for arguing with them, saying they could afford to pay me like that. I explained that I didn\u2019t have to babysit for them, and that I was doing it because I love my siblings, but they lived 30 minutes from me and $100 a month would even cover gas to their house, let alone food and other things, like activities for the kids. They didn\u2019t reply. \n\nSo am I the asshole?", "created_utc": 1687979866, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/14lidnz/aita_for_wanting_to_be_paid_for_babysitting_my/", "score": 41, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The only reason you were doing so was based upon an agreement that they decided to change retroactively and without your consent. You're right in holding fast to your boundaries. If they can't or won't abide by your expectations, then let them find different accommodations. Don't let their manipulation of calling your names, such as selfishness, deter you from doing what's right for yourself. If you were in a position to afford it, had the time and emotional energy for it, and agreed to it, then it would be a different story. Since that's not the case, they can't take advantage of you or suggest they have the privilege of doing so because they're family.
