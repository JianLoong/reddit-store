It was chalked up to someone was too wasted and didn\u2019t really what they were doing.  \n\nIt kept happening tho, and on different floors and at random times. I don\u2019t know how many times it happened I\u2019ve heard different numbers, I\u2019ve been told it was 10 but it went on for almost an entire academic year before the guy got caught. Maintenance was super pissed and refused to clean it after the 2nd incident. So School called in a professional cleaning service to deal with it each time cause they had to as it was a health hazard.  And they weren\u2019t happy either. The 5th time it happened everyone living in dorms had to attend meetings with head of housing who gave a big speech about how it was nasty & whoever responsible needed to own up & take their punishment.  The entire building being fined was threatened as well so It turned into this big ole man hunt for the shower pooper.  \n\n\n\nIt was a long time ago, like 2015. I\u2019ve probably forgotten some details, I do remember my BF\u2019s floor getting hit shortly after winter break, I think and it was nasty. All the showers would be deep cleaned when it happened. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure how this dude was caught all I remember was was he was frat, no one in the frat or Greek life liked him. Someone in his frat discovered it was him and they got proof of it & not only did the report him to school but they also shared it with the rest of campus.  I\u2019m not sure if the school punished him or not, I do know he left before the semester ended, never came back, and all his social media was deleted.", "Well, at least he had to decency to be ashamed of his actions?
