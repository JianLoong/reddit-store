I carry a water bottle everywhere with me, that is very recognizably mine, and that I have stickers on. Also, my name is on the bottom. About a week ago, I forgot it in one of the cubbies in our college gym (many people leave stuff in the cubbies long term, so it\u2019s not like this was a bad thing), and when I realized a few hours later and went to get it, it was gone. I was pretty bummed. But I figured it was my fault, I\u2019d left it, and someone had stolen it.\n\nToday, I was walking into the library, and I saw my water bottle, sitting on a table! I went to go grab it, but when I picked it up, a girl sitting at the table said, \u201chey! That\u2019s my water bottle!\u201d I said no, it isn\u2019t, I accidentally left it at the gym a week ago. It was mine. She tried to grab it back from me, told me I was stealing her water bottle, and that she would call the campus police on me. She had a few friends with her at the table, who were getting annoyed as well. It was at this point that I got pissed. I asked her where she\u2019d gotten the bottle from, she said off of Amazon. So, I tilted the bottom towards her, and said, \u201cThen why does it have my name and number on the bottom?\u201d She rolled her eyes at me and told me to screw off, that I didn\u2019t need to be such an asshole about it. I took the water bottle.\n\nA friend was with me at the time, and said that I made a big deal out of nothing, and that I probably embarrassed her in front of her friends, and that I should\u2019ve just gotten a new water bottle instead of being an asshole since I had left it in the gym i. the first place.

The thief did, when they didn't fess up when first asked. They had plenty of opportunity to admit it was not theirs, no harm no foul (I guess.) But *they* latched on to the idea that it was truly theirs to begin with. \n\nAlso, losing something is NOT equivalent to giving it up. It's still *your* property lmao. \n\nAbsolutely NTA.", "NTA. You did what was necessary to get your property back.  No need to doubt yourself.  Friend is totally and completely wrong.", "Nta it's your property and if it has your name and number on it there is no logical reason for her to not have tried to give it back to you rather than simply wanting a free bottle", "To me, NTA. You claimed back what it was stolen from you. I think it's fair.", "NTA. If she didn't steal your bottle and swear she bought it, she wouldn't have been embarrassed in front of her friends.", "NTA. I think what you did is laudable. Can you imagine lying so hard about a water bottle? The bottle meant absolutely nothing to her, yet she still tried to fight for it. You didn't embarrass her in front of her friends \u2014 she did that. You took back what was yours. Good for you!", "NTA  In college she should already know the lesson we all learned in kindergarten. If it\u2019s not yours don\u2019t touch it.", "NTA, your friend doesn't sound great if they're ok with your stuff being stolen and are more worried about the thief's feelings than yours.", "Nta, you should have called her a thief before walking away, hope she was thoroughly embarrassed Infront of her friends", "Definitely NTA.\n\nIf she didn\u2019t want to be embarrassed and humiliated, maybe she shouldn\u2019t have stolen the water bottle or denied it wasn\u2019t hers. That\u2019s on her.", "NTA - In what world is it okay to let a thief keep something they stole from you? \u201cFinders keepers, losers weepers\u201d isn\u2019t applicable in the real world and I think it\u2019s time your friend learned that.\n\nIt was your water bottle. If there\u2019s any kind of lost and found, then she should\u2019ve taken it there, not kept it for herself. And when you say it had your number, do you mean *phone* number? So she could\u2019ve contacted you at any time to return it? Doubly AH. And then to lie to your face and try to keep it *knowing* it wasn\u2019t really hers. Why the heck should this behavior be rewarded with a stranger\u2019s property? You did the right thing.", "NTA.\n\nShe was being an AH by stealing it in the first place", "NTA - she stole it \\*and\\* threatened you and claimed you had stolen it.  Not sure why your friend wouldn't have your back in such an obvious situation.", "NTA. Finders keepers is not morally right. The right thing to do is return lost items to their owners.", "NTA she shouldn\u2019t have lied about getting it from Amazon and shoulda just been like whoops I figured whoever left it at the gym didn\u2019t want it and moved on", "NTA \n \nShe literally stole something, lied about it when confronted, threatened to call the police when she was the one who stole it, and made a fool out of herself when you showed her the bottom. \n \nShe deserves any embarrassment she received. Maybe it\u2019ll keep her from taking things that don\u2019t belong to her in the future.", "NTA.", "NTA - So what if you embarrassed her in front of her friends.  She's a thief!", "NTA.\n\nMaybe your friend has issues with confrontation with strangers so easier for them to call you the AH.", "NTA who the hell cares if you embarrassed her in front of her friends. Thieves should be called out and embarrassed. Why does your friend care about her feelings when she stole your property?", "People who steal often are good at manipulating people and deflecting blame.", "NTA\n\nOf all things to steal.... a used water bottle? Yea... no thanks. Even after sanitizing the life out of it, I still wouldn't think it was sanitized enough. But that is just me and my water bottle sharing issues.\n\nAnd why would anyone want to keep a water bottle with someone else's name and number written on it? \nIf you're going to steal something, make sure it can't be traced back to you! I'd have inspected the the  bottle up and down. Moment I saw the name and number, and if I couldn't get it off the bottle, then that is my sign from above that it's not meant to be, and to leave it behind.\n\nThief got what she deserves. \n\nAs for your friends... she needs to understand that it's the principle of things. Bad people cannot be rewarded for doing bad things. \n\nAnd everyone knows the price of everything has gone up these days. Why would you buy a new water bottle if you found the one you lost?!", "Uh... NTA. Why is it even a question?\n\nShe took something that wasn't hers, like a child. She deserved to be called out, like a child. \n\nYou're in college. You're all young adults. You learned not to take things that aren't yours in like, preschool, I assume.

I once complimented a posh girl in my dorm on her coat and she aggressively asked me \"Is it yours?\" It turns out she'd found it on the floor and instead of handing it in to lost property she just kept it.
