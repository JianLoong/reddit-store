It was chalked up to someone was too wasted and didn\u2019t really what they were doing.  \n\nIt kept happening tho, and on different floors and at random times. I don\u2019t know how many times it happened I\u2019ve heard different numbers, I\u2019ve been told it was 10 but it went on for almost an entire academic year before the guy got caught. Maintenance was super pissed and refused to clean it after the 2nd incident. So School called in a professional cleaning service to deal with it each time cause they had to as it was a health hazard.  And they weren\u2019t happy either. The 5th time it happened everyone living in dorms had to attend meetings with head of housing who gave a big speech about how it was nasty & whoever responsible needed to own up & take their punishment.  The entire building being fined was threatened as well so It turned into this big ole man hunt for the shower pooper.  \n\n\n\nIt was a long time ago, like 2015. I\u2019ve probably forgotten some details, I do remember my BF\u2019s floor getting hit shortly after winter break, I think and it was nasty. All the showers would be deep cleaned when it happened. \n\nI\u2019m not exactly sure how this dude was caught all I remember was was he was frat, no one in the frat or Greek life liked him. Someone in his frat discovered it was him and they got proof of it & not only did the report him to school but they also shared it with the rest of campus.

Face the consequences", "NTA but I'm really concerned about your friend. Do they have massive problems around confrontation? Can they advocate for themselves? Because thinking that was excessive behavior is really worrying", "Nope, great job confronting the thief! If she didn't want to be embarrassed,  then maybe she shouldn't be stealing. I mean, come on, your name and number were on the bottom. She knew how to find you and return it. She stole, I hope she was really embarrassed. Someone who would steal a water bottle, would take anything.", "NTA and the fact that anyone thinks you are makes me worry about peoples judgment abilities. We\u2019re having more sympathy for thieves that have an attitude than about calling out thievery? What?", "NTA\n\nIf someone takes something of yours, and you can prove that it's yours, you have every right to take it back. Finders Keepers only works if it's something that doesn't literally have someones name or other proof of ownership on it.", "NTA, should\u2019ve emptied it over her head", "100% NTA - but the thief is!!!", "NTA. Why should you spend the money on a new water bottle just so the person who stole it doesn't feel embarrassed?", "esh, youre not an 'a hole' but i dont see a reason to antagonize her if she already stole your stuff and tried to keep it what else do u think she would do  \nnot being an asshole doesnt mean you should try to make enemies with anyone you have 'justification' for, try to stay calm next time. like just show them the tag and say i think u got confused you found this and were looking for the owner right or smth like that  \nand yes u did make a big deal out of it, your friend watching it literally told u. like u dont have to write it out on a forum where random people with less context and less info to judge unless all u want to hear is people saying \"ur right so please put on another show at your own demerit next time anyone antagonizes you\"  \nlike all u did was make an enemy (or more if her friends dont like u either) who lives nearby u. was that worth it bro", ">but i dont see a reason to antagonize her if she already stole your stuff and tried to keep it what else do u think she would do\n\nOp antagonized her? How exactly? By not cheerfully having an 'open' and 'honest' conversation with the adult thief about why stealing is wrong? \n\nOp antagonized her by trying to take back ber stolen water bottle and the thief started making it a big deal even going so far to say she bought it on Amazon?\n\nYou sure bent over backwards to understand this thief and say Op sucks. Hope you good? Need a water bottle too?", "everyone here is high on their 'moral gratification' and doesnt care about u so not a single person let u know that ur going to be hoping u never run in to her for the next X years ur at college, forever if youre a local, and god forbid you meet her in a classroom or have to work together in a group, or meet in a workplace, at the supermarket, or anything at all really.  \ndont make enemies! filling the world with more enemies does nothing for you!", "You left it for a few hours!  I have been at the gym all day, and no one ever assumed they were welcome to take my stuff because it was sitting in a cubby, so easy to just take.\n\nThere's no technically about it.  She straight up stole.", "I don't know why your friend thinks thieves are deserving of dignity and decorum?\n\nWhat does it matter if it was a water bottle or a backpack? It's still theft and she deserved to be called out for it.", "Drop the friend who cares more about you making a scene than getting your property back.", "Aw. Someone at stole my (previously \u201ccool\u201d custom Nalgene) bottle when I worked at a grocery store. I wish I had this moment. NTA", "Some people think you can never be rude. That is false and foolish and leads you to be treated poorly your entire life. \n\nMany people actually require rudeness for you to deal with them effectively.", "Okay but there's like a logic to stealing electronics and panties.\n\nStealing a water bottle with plans to continue using it as a personal water bottle is...gross. And stealing a water bottle with someone else's name on it is stupid.", "yeah, there's something off when your friend's defending such an obvious bag of spinchters. stealing someone's property and lying about it is certainly not *nothing*.\n\nNTA", "Yeah by that girls logic I should have claimed the Kate Spade purse I found at my daughters swim lesson the other day instead of returning it to the front desk. What a missed opportunity", "I could be 100 bucks richer right now, guy in front of me dropped a bill and walked away, clearly it was intended for me.\n\nI feel dumb for running after him screaming bloody hell for him to come back for his cash.", "NTA", "Instead of a new water bottle, you need to get a new friend. NTA", "NTA. Should've also said you had herpes, just to get under her skin.", "NTA your friend is weird", "NTA & ditch the friend", "NTA. Your friend is, dafuq is up with that? Who the fuck defends a thief?", "NTA", "NTA but the girl who stole your bottle is, and so is your supposed 'friend' who defended her actions. Perhaps reconsider that person's status in your life, OP.", "NTA - you weren't rude to a girl, you were rude to a lying thief", "NTA you literally had your name on it", "NTA embarrassing her? She is a fucking thief. Embarrassment suits her well.", "Absolutely NTA. I would\u2019ve asked a third party person to call the number on the bottom to settle this dispute.\nNow, I\u2019m going to write my name and number on my sticker bombed bottle!", "Hard NTA. Do it again if you have the chance.", "NTA- there are lost and found areas for a reason.", "ew, who's stealing water bottles", "NTA, but honestly I'd get rid of the \"friend\" that told me to let it go.  Your GD name was on the bottom of the bottle! Who needs friends like that?", "Whaaaaaaatttt??? Reclaiming stolen property is wrong now because you may embarrass the thief??? If she didn't want to get publicly called out as a thief, she just doesn't need to steal?\n\n NTA, and your friend is a psycho.", "NTA \n\nHell nah, embarrass that thief in front of her friends.\n\nShe didn't have the grace to just let you take it back, she got snotty with you first.", "NTA.\n\nShe is disgusting, why would someone stole a water bottle. She embarrassed herself by stilling a water bottle.", "Please have your friend explain to me why it's a bad thing to embarrass the thief who stole your water bottle when she digs in her heels, lies, and insists it's hers.   Until then, NTA.", "nta. your friend is a pushover.", "What kind of disgusting human starts using a random water bottle they found at the gym \ud83e\udd2e", "Nta. Her friends need to know not to leave things out around the thief. What you did is a public service.", "NTA but ESH if she was hot ...", "Maybe it was a hydroflask? Those usually run anywhere between $30-50 depending on the size. At my undergrad people would steal them all the time \u2639\ufe0f", "We are speaking about a water bottle in a gym. She could have just bring it to lost and found. \n\nThank for loving and using with your mount and saliva my water bottle?", "If someone leaves their wallet behind in the bus am I free to take it home and keep it?", "If you pick up something from a gym that has a name and number and you do not call the number you stole it.", "So because someone is so crazy to stole a water bottle op should just let her walk all over herself? Plus if I was the girl friend I would have stop to hang out with her. That is to disgusting.", "you also found out which friend wont have your back .\n\nNTA", "She stole it,  no technicalities", "Your friend is a pushover and an idiot. Don't listen to them. Shame thrives every time you can catch them. NTA", "NTA, your friend needs to back off and Google the meaning of things she says.", "If someone is knowingly in the wrong then it's fine to be rude to them.", "Sure, but there is a world of difference between a water bottle and a wallet. BTW you never said if you checked the lost and found", "You seem to be focusing on everyone's actions except the OP", "\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01\ud83d\ude01", "Especially on a college campus where people throw free trinkets like water bottles at you constantly.", "Stealing panties = logical\nStealing water bottle = gross\n\nYou might want to examine your thinking here, really telling on yourself.", "Wow, sounds like you have shitty morals.\n\nI'm not OP btw", "Yes, exactly! Stealing a water bottle in general is just ridiculous.\n\nLike you can buy bottled water for $2. Just feels like the risk outweighs the reward in stealing a stranger's water bottle from a gym or some place similar.", "I don't endorse stealing panties but I can understand the perversion behind someone doing that. It's not like stealing underwear is a \"random\" theft like taking a pen from a bank.", "I think you are confused about this sub, I'm not asking AITA, OP is. I'm saying walking up to someone and snatching something off them without talking to them about it is an A move", "Why even bother stealing underwear when you could just get a cheap pair from Walmart or something?", "You mean walking to someone and taking back what is yours? Bruh please, get your head out the toilet because all the shit you swallowed is coming back out."]}
