Then having the audacity to not prostrate himself in your presence for being a f\\*cking demon and begging for your forgiveness. Sorry for that, had to get it off my chest. Real talk though, he should be making an effort to form a connection with you if he must. Tell him to travel to meet with you and spend more time with you. It is his obligation as much as it is his prerogative to seek a relationship, and it is your prerogative to offer or not offer him that relationship on your terms, with a minute obligation on your part to live up to your word... barring unforeseen circumstances, of course. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyway, hope that helps, sorry for the projection."]}
