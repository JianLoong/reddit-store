I don't go out to dinner with brokies that I have to pay for, and I don't expect anyone to pay for me. It's not really a big deal other than him being a whiner.", "NTA.  If he's worth having as a friend, he'll eventually realize you were 100% correct and move past it.", "YTA. He confided in you that he felt like a failure. It sounds like he's actually doing perfectly fine (80k isn't nothing) and was probably looking for a little friendly reassurance. Instead, your response was to pry into his finances, investigate the cost of his travel plans, and then judge him for going to a concert that he was really looking forward to instead of buying his nephews expensive presents they probably don't need or pay a whole dinner bill when his parents were perfectly able to pay their own share. Obligatory gift culture is the worst.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

Also 80k is a good salary but depending on cost of living where they are the money left over for \"extras\" may not be a lot. Sucks that he framed it the way he did but also it's weird she starting monitoring his finances after the comment. He would have been the AH if he expected her to still get him something but he didn't. My friends and I don't do gifts and it allows for more money on activities which I prefer."]}
