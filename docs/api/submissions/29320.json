Again; everyone has managed to move on except him.", "Apologize for telling the truth after he verbally came after you trying to make himself look better than you in front of his in-laws??? The only person who needs to apologize is your brother. You even tried to de-escalate it but he kept going on. FAFO\n\nNTA", "No, don't apologize.

Sounds like he got what he wanted to give you. \n\nWhy apologize to him for him for the truth? \n\n**Moreover, if he wanted to do this privately he could\u2019ve.** Instead, he tried to do it in front of everyone, in-laws and kids included. **Audience and situation weren\u2019t of concern until it became a matter of **him** facing harsh truths.**", "Don't apologize. You have nothing to apologize for. He decided to act like he's morally superior in front of everyone by putting you down.

I don't even know. May be unkind to say, but I gotta point a finger and say that perhaps this kind of coddling isn't a new thing, and OP is more than right and righteous to be pissed about it.\n\nSeems only family *was* present too - OP's brother's and his wife's. We all know whose fault it is that the brother's in-laws didn't know about his past... and the list doesn't include OP.\n\nEdit: I just realized too. Had OP not said anything, I would imagine the brother's in-laws would likely have some questions after the party, and the brother and SIL would've lied their asses off, continued with the picture of a useless leech. While it wouldn't matter much as it's not OP's in-laws, it does add a flavor to the situation - the brother and SIL no doubt have been sprinkling in BS about OP, and they would've added even more if given the chance. *That* is what OP's parents are enabling as well, on top of the verbal abuse (while happily reaping the benefits of a house they didn't need to pay to keep) - ok, I'll correct myself and point *two* accusing fingers at these parents.", "Fuck that! Is exactly what I was coming to say! brother has a lot of nerves!", "Right, where were Mom & Dad's voices while bro was spouting his misconceptions and outright lies? They wouldn't defend OP and now they think he's an AH for defending himself.", "This.  Addicts are very manipulative, and OP's brother is still an addict.  He may not be using but the behavioral habits are still there.", "Yeah, that man has \"dry drunk\" energy. The mean kind that hits the kids but calls it \"spanking\" like that makes it better.", "Again, moving on is not when someone just forgets their past. The brother has \"moved on\" by ignoring and forgetting everything that he did to the family. How is OP supposed to move on after not getting any of his or his parents' money back?

Must be tough to have to face that they fucked up with both their kids, and they still can't let go of that dynamic - still making it OP's problem to feel bad about instead of actually addressing the massive issues at hand.\n\nBrother may be sober, but he's a coddled asshole. The parents need to get it together - if they push OP too hard, they may well be moved to the basement of OP's house.", "Oh, and not just an addict.  A thief as well, with priors he may not have mentioned.\n\nOne hopes that brief sense of moral superiority was worth it...", "And sheltered from consequences in the long run.

Learning your daughter is married to a hypocrite, someone willing to misrepresent someone to make themselves look better.", "Not only did he lie, their daughter lied, and he has the gall to try and shame OP for *literally* no reason, or a fake reason, because I think we can all agree OP has done fucking amazing even without this so-called \"guidance\" the brother spoke of. *Whose* guidance, *I wonder*, the family man who put himself on a pedestal of arrogance and an erased past, who hasn't even paid his own parents back for all of their financial assistance?\n\nYeah, *OP* is the one who has to do better in life.\n\nMan, I'd also wanna be a fly on the wall to watch these people realize that their daughter lied to them about her husband's past and, I don't doubt for a second, also lied about OP when speaking about them. I feel like the brother seemed a wee bit *too* comfortable just laying it into OP in front of people.", "OP not only owns the home he lives in, but is looking after his parents. He\u2019s not holding how they threw money at his brother as his expense on them, that responsibility is on the man who never showed gratitude for it. That\u2019s more proper Christian value than OP\u2019s brother actually practices.", "It borders on hilarity to see a man who burned thru his parents money, didn't do jack to atone for it (so much for finding religion), and has the gall to berate their sibling for being the responsible one. Oh wow, excuse OP for not being an upstanding married with kids man, could it perhaps be because OP is too busy worrying and caring for two adults who failed to properly care for them (OP)?\n\nWe'll never know. And I'm sure OP's brother will be right there with us because what, *he* could possibly have any responsibility and guilt over the state of his parents' finances? That's absurd."]}
