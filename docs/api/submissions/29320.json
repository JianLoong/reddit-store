Instead of paying your parents back, he acts like it never happened.", "Nah bro. Your parents are once again trying to \"help\" your brother. The Christian in him thought it was okay to mock you and your lifestyle in front of others, which I'm guessing included your nephews/nieces. He opened the door for a public spectacle then he needs to eat shit in public too. Also God damn that dude to have the audacity to call you out when he's not even trying to mitigate the circumstances he put you and your parents in. Fuck him, maybe big daddy in law needed to hear the truth.", "NTA.

His in laws now know what type of liar he is.\n\nYour parents should be on your side. It feels like they still put their druggy son on a pedestal.\n\nDo they really appreciate and understand that you didn\u2019t have to help them by buying off their house and letting them live upstairs? You could have left them get homeless. You could have made them live downstairs in the basement.\n\nI think it\u2019s time to remind your parents to be appreciative of the amazing gift you\u2019ve given them.", "Nta. So many addicts (and many ppl in general) seem to have selective memory or \"it didnt count because i was high\" syndrome. Its infuriating. Even worse when those same ppl think they are high & mighty and like to pass judgment on everyone else (except themselves, dont anyone have the right to judge them). More ironic that someone who is religious thinks that it is ok to pass judgment on anyone. \n I bet it felt good in a sense to call him out on his hypocrisy & to have his own judgment right in his face.

Had he not tried to humiliate you and talk you down in the presence of family, you would have kept shut. He is a jerk, not for his past, but for not paying back his parents, for never thanking you for stepping up, for being stuck-up and thinking himself better than others now that he has his life back on track and found religion. He's suddenly holier than the Pope and feels the need to 'convert' others. I think his in-laws needed to know it.", "But... it was only family there.  His family, and his in-laws, who usually count as family when someone wants something.\n\nYour brother absolutely deserved what happened.

People in glasshouses shouldn\u2019t throw stones.", "Just seem par for the course.   Born again Christians tend to be the most self righteous hypocrites you will ever meet.

If you apologize, he will feel  free to spread more deceptive statements about you.", "He thinks that, because he's now religious, his past is erased.

So not only your college fund but the rehab fund got up his nose too", "Unfortunately no, bc that was their parents' money, not OP's.

You need to ask him when he will be paying your parents and you back. That he needs to step up and take accountability for his sins.  Throw his nonsense back at him.", "> I'm going to apologize but stay away.\n\nAt least make your apology contingent on him apologizing first.  A real apology, not a \"I'm sorry you felt that way\" non-apology, but a real one that starts with \"I was wrong to belittle you,\" then acknowledges what you did for him and your parents, and concludes with a promise not to belittle you again.\n\nIf he can't do that, then giving him an unconditional apology is just enabling him.

You're my hero.", "Don't apologize, double down on your behavior, the ungrateful person believes he has the right to judge after putting his parents in debt to the point of almost causing them to lose their house and not giving them a single cent, he needs them to figure it out.", "Apologies for what u didn't say anything that wasn't true he's the one who owe u an apology he shouldn't have spoken to u that way knowing what u did to save your parents house because of his actions.", "Yup", "The brother has become religious. Any mocking comes not from wanting what\u2019s best for OP but rather from religious based sanctimoniousness. He thinks he\u2019s better than OP because of whatever BS his religion is feeding him.

Now I can judge others for some reason.", "But that's taking the brother's side.

A reformed ddict doesn't get to judge anyone he hurt that badly, or anyone who is *still* suffering from the effects of his addiction, such as the parents who lost ownership of their house.\n\nSo I recommend that if the brother ever tries anything like that again, the OP has every right to demand that his brother to pay back the full value of the house and the OP's college fund, before he says another critical word. Because yes, I think the brother will feel the impulse to do it again.", "Oh he's probably not a former addict at all - he just traded drugs for the opium of the masses.", "A former addict who converts to religion can be extremely difficult, mainly they just switch addictions from drugs/alcohol to a cult mentality.

I hate the man. He is absolutely obsessed with religion while also being a thief and a father to 7 children that he traumatized heavily.

And in most cases it's the wrong side\n\nBingo.  So many historical figures have said the same, for starters, Dr King:\n\n* *I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate \u2026who is more devoted to \u201corder\u201d than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: \u201cI agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action\u201d \u2026*\n\nAnd Archbishop Desmond Tutu:\n\n* *\u201cIf you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor. If an elephant has its foot on the tail of a mouse, and you say that you are neutral, the mouse will not appreciate your neutrality.\u201d*\n\nAnd Thomas Paine:\n\n* *\u201cSilence becomes a kind of crime when it operates as a cover or an encouragement to the guilty.\u201d*", "To add on to this. The parents probably think by staying neutral, everything will sort out and that the brothers can maintain a good relationship. But it rarely ever happens like that. The person that gets stepped on over and over and gets told to stay quiet for the sake of family will never be at peace as that person will continue to be stomped on", "Sounds like the dude skipped steps eight and nine.", "I would put money that he had had conversations with his inlaws about his brother and had worked himself into a mentality where, completely ignoring how he caused the situation, he was entirely focused on this self righteous feeling or duty of saving his brother from sin. His inlaws probably fed that mentality and so this entire performance was a show for them.", "I bet he gives all credit to God and was trying to preach to his brother to show how Godly he has become to his in laws.", "Family guy did the same thing. Then gave us that Mr. Booze song.", "Probably a huge chunk of it is not wanting to be embarrassed in front of their son\u2019s in laws. About one of their sons struggling with addiction (which shouldn\u2019t be embarrassing, it can happen in any family) or about living in a house their other son is paying for because they almost lost it or just about their sons fighting in front of other people. Or all of it. \n\nWho knows maybe they even feel embarrassed that brother\u2019s choices and their actions taken to help/protect him had such negative consequences on OP and they feel a little guilty about that.\n\nETA: also it feels like the in laws are the \u201cpillar of the community\u201d types who are hellaciously judgmental of everyone else for no damn reason.
