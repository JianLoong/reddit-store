The reason he pushed for the movie is he wanted to be closer to the other woman.\n\nSo mom and I were stuck far away from family and friends and it was super hard for my mom. She struggled a lot being away from everyone she loved. I missed my grandparents who were HUGE parts of my life before the move.\n\nMy dad ended up marrying the other woman and now I have a stepsister who's 11 and on the spectrum and two half sister's who are 5 and 2. The three girls are really obsessed with me and they think I'm their hero and best friend. My relationship with them has always been hard for me because they want me around more but I have spent less and less time at my dad's since the courts granted me permission to choose.\n\nMom and I both miss home still. Mostly, we miss being near family. So we talked about moving and mom went to court and won the right to move with me if I wanted to.\n\nMy dad has told me I cannot go. He was all *ignore what the judge said, think of your family, think of your sisters, think of me* and I told him they were not reason enough for me to stay. I told him I have wanted my grandparents closer for a long time and now I can see them every day when mom and I move. He asked how I can leave my little sisters who need me and love me so much. He told me as my father he was saying I could not go and that's it.\n\nI told him I'm moving whether he likes it or not and there's nothing he can do to stop it now.\n\nHe called me an asshole for speaking to him that way and callously dismissing the harm it will do to my sisters.\n\nAITA?", "created_utc": 1692460164, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/15vjpep/aita_for_telling_my_dad_im_moving_whether_he/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Its as simple as that.", "NTA\n\nIt's sad that you have this rocky relationship with your siblings but it's absolutely not your fault. Your dad did you a huge disservice. Not only did your family break apart but then he yanked you from everything you knew??? Of course you feel resentful and want to go back home.\n\nYour dad made many mistakes and is pissed off you aren't willing to accept and forgive them. Move with your mom.

He can destroy a family by cheating. But you can't destroy your sisters by moving out of the house?   Fuck him.", "NTA your dad is manipulating you for his benefit. Do what's best for you.", "Wish the best fresh start for you and mom :)", "NTA. He's a hypocrite. He didn't care about his family when he moved you to take up with this woman.  He's got his new life. Now you and your mom will rebuild and heal by going home!", "NTA and please feel free to go no contact with this narcissistic man.", "Nta. Dad never considered the harm his cheating and forcing you to move would do to you and your mom so why should you care now? I do feel slightly bad for your sisters though ngl.", "NTA.  Op you are thinking of your family, you are thinking of you and your mom.  Your sisters are not your responsibility.   You can offer to do video/phone calls with them (this is what I did when I moved in with my mom in another state at 16). Ultimately you need to do what's best for you and your mentap health", "NTA Oh the audacity of your dad to tell you to \"think of your family\" when he's the one who caused this whole situation by not thinking about his family.  If you're not happy and you have the opportunity to move back home with your mom, do it.  There's no reason to stick around and be miserable because your dad wants to put his wife's kids first.  \n\nIt might be wise to get your mom's lawyer involved to see if they can intervene with your dad and him trying to pressure you to stay when it was already decided you have a choice.
