I recommend LC after you leave for your own mental health.", "NTA, a father like this doesn't deserve respect for the way he's treated you and your mother.", "NTA..  you are going to leave just when you are at the perfect free babysitter age...  your decision.. not your cruel dads.....", "NTA. I am honestly blown away by the amount of hypocrisy I see in this subreddit. I feel like every other post is someone getting guilted because the other person doesn't like the consequences of their own actions.\n\nYour dad moved you and your mother to be closer to his mistress, but now that you want to leave, it's all \"think of your family\". Maybe he should have thought about his ow family before uprooting it and tearing it apart in the first place.", "NTA, you're old enough to make these kinds of decisions and you know what's good for you. Your sisters may love and miss you, but they're not going to die without you. They can deal with loss, or learn to deal with it as much as anyone. And it's not like you'll never see them again either - unless you decide not to. I'm sorry your dad is guilting you like this. Love your life fella.", "OP is an innocent bystander too and isn't obligated to do anything so...", "Ask him: Did he \u2018think of family, think of you\u2019 when he tricked his family into moving and betrayed and left you? Is he callously dismissing the harm he did to you?  \n\nNTA and your dad is just selfish, he doesn\u2019t want his new lady to be sad about her kids and stop sleeping with him, or for things to be less comfortable for him. He\u2019s treated your feelings as worthless for 8 years, and he\u2019s still doing it. Ruuuuuuun.", "NTA, get out, spend time with your Grandparents", "He wants a babysitter for his children. If you leave , he will be stuck with 2 small kids and one stepchild on the spectrum. Please go and stay with your mom and be close to your grandparents, ppl who truly love you and have your interests at heart.", "They have been granted permission by the court to leave.", "This is great. You can choose if you want to see him, which you should do only if he wants to spend 1:1 time with you and not force you to interact with toddlers and other ppl you don\u2019t care about.", "This. I was blessed to have my paternal grandparents until my late 30s, but I would give up everything for one more day.", "NTA Tell him if he doesn't respect his own family obligations, why do you have to?", "goodness NTA. he wants to talk about his new family, but he was willing to hurt YOU to make it happen. i hope you and your mom are able to heal and move forward. don\u2019t listen to what your father says, he\u2019s only trying to guilt and manipulate you.", "NTA a million times over. Your dad is selfish just thinking of his needs, his daughters. He is going to regret this. Good luck on the move and better times for you and your mom.", "Lol. He's telling you to think of the family? Did he think of the family when he cheated and basically forced you all to move? Nah. NTA at all. Go with your mom, be happy, and perhaps seek therapy for what your dad did to you if you haven't already.", "Oh, so now you're the asshole because he doesn't want to receive the same treatment and stress that he put you and your mother years ago. Fuck him, is sad for your little sisters since they are not guilty, but your Dad can go fuck himself, and if he won't obey a Judge's orders he would perfectly go to Jail as well.", "NTA. He forced you and your mom to move so he could openly cheat on your mom, basically stranded you guys out there with no help from family. And he feels he has a right to play the \u201cthink of family\u201d card? He betrayed his family! Those \u201csisters\u201d? OP, you don\u2019t have to claim them as your sisters. You may not realise this but the reason the relationship with them is difficult for you is because you resent them because they are still part of your dad and tbh your dad is high key forcing you to have a relationship with them.", "He has no say in this, if the judge granted you permission to choose, you're gone.  NTAH.", "Nta. I'm sorry he's doing this to you. He's selfish, by and far.", "NTA. Your Dad is evil and manipulative. I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve been able to bond with your siblings despite the history of your parents but that isn\u2019t enough for you to abandon your Mom and her family. Your Dad is delusional", "NTA. I\u2019m so sorry you are going through this hun!", "Your dad is still being the manipulative self centered asshole and is trying to guilt you into staying. You and your mom both deserve to be happy. Feel free to move back to the town  where your friends and grandparents are. Your dad will just have to cope.\n\nIt's obvious that your dad and step-mom have built you up in the minds of your step-sisters the expectation that you're their new best friend. You had no control over that and have no obligation to fill that role. They are too young to understand but hopefully will when they get older.\n\nYour dad will probably be immature and take it out on you for a while so please prepare yourself for him to be distant and/or angry. It's okay, he'll eventually get over it or you will.\n\nBest wishes regardless of what you decide. I hope your mom and you find a sense of home and roots whatever you choose.", "NTA. You have the right of decision on where you wanted to be at. Since your mom won the right to move with you, I would move back home where family is. Please do what is the best for YOU and your mom. Don't listen to your dad if he can't respect your boundaries.", "NTA\n\nYour father is terribly selfish and manipulative.", "NTA\n\nDon't let your dad's emotional manipulation get to you.  You actually owe him nothing and he's done plenty of harm to you even if he won't admit it.\n\nWhat I'd probably do is stop talking about your move.  If you stop, your dad may think it's not happening so he has less change to sabotage it or make you feel more guilty.\n\nHe doesn't have to know the specifics and he also doesn't have to know when it's going to happen. \n\nIt may suck for your stepsister and half sisters because they will miss you.  Your dad may say he will miss you but what he's saying is he'll miss the son that's their to entertain the younger kids so he isn't bothered by them.\n\nAnd he clearly didn't think of his family when he moved you under false pretenses so he could continue with his side piece.  If she knew he was married your stepmom is as bad as him as it takes two to tango.", "NTA. I think he feels he's missing a babysitter and is using the sisters for manipulative purposes", "dreadful indeed. OP, NTA. your father has some nerve.", " I feel like every other post is someone getting guilted because the other person doesn't like the consequences of their own actions.", "People that are self centered enough to like about their motives for moving are pretty much bullet proof to any sense of guilt by their sense of entitlement. I know my dad was when he left my mom for another woman.", "Preferably in front of an impartial witness ie one of your dad's work colleagues that doesn't know what a dick your dad is because he's projecting the image of a fine family man when it couldn't be further from the truth."]}
