I wanted to know why this was the case, but mostly I just wanted to know it wasn't because of my gender (both the gender I was born as and my gender identity).

To me it sounds like she realized that people would be making more of a fuss about you on her big day, and the attention would be off of her.", "Wow so many bigoted comments, it\u2019s awful. OP you\u2019re so NTA for expressing your feelings to your friend. It doesn\u2019t sound like you were insisting on anything or making it about you. You had a legitimate sense that you were being left out & othered because of your gender identity. I\u2019m sorry your friend is doing this to you and that so many people are being horrible in the comments.", "I'm going to guess that, behind the scenes, your presence in the bridal party is becoming an issue for her family and her other guests -- especially now that you're shifting more towards your feminine side and that you asked to wear a dress. Also, I'm not sure how comfortable she is with a sexual-male (i.e., not based on gender) being in her room as she dresses on her wedding day.\n\nI think that, rather than allowing her wedding to become a battleground for gender politics, she has opted to exclude you from the bridal party.\n\n1. Regardless what I may think, you can be gracious and accept her decisions. Of course, it is your prerogative to decline to go to the wedding if you feel strongly enough; on the other hand, it seems to me that you could wear a dress now that you're freed from the shackles of the wedding party(!).\n2. Or you can continue to question her decisions and place your friendship in jeopardy.\n\nNAH", "These comments are not it\u2026", "I'll have to go NAH.\n\nI think the bride had other things to worry about besides the issues you had and therefore made a judgement call to have you step down. I think it's within her rights to do that because she probably didn't have the capacity to find a compromise shortly before the wedding (if she even did want to compromise).\n\nI think this sucks for you because you wanted to dress feminine while (judging from your comments) being more masculine presenting to the unknowing eye. So that probably creates a whole lot of problems for you, on a daily basis. So I get why you would be hurt that she didn't want to deter from her personal plans.\n\nSo all in all I think this is just an unfortunate situation for everyone. It doesn't sound like bride wanted to hurt you, and I don't think it's unreasonable for you to feel uncomfortable whith the whole situation.", "NTA - I don\u2019t know what is up with these comments.  I think the bride doesn\u2019t want any drama at her wedding and I get that, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s really your friend.  I would throw down against bigots in my family to have my Maid of Honor be themselves.  She should never have asked you if she wasn\u2019t prepared for the comments, because judgy people are going to be assholes.  I also agree that you were being excluded and while if she discussed any of these decisions with you privately and ahead of time, I might have cut her some slack.  But the delivery and the attitude make her the asshole here.  I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.", "I\u2019m gonna break it down a bit.\n\nOutfit- First off, it\u2019s pretty common that the maid of honor would be dressed differently than the rest of the party, whether it be a different style or color. Whether it was a suit or not, and ultimately it is the brides choice. \n\nGetting ready- Ultimately, from the get go of the post you identified yourself as a man, gender-fluid but overall, a male. Any girls getting ready with her might not feel comfortable with a guy in the room, people changing or zippers or anything, you get what I\u2019m saying. Since the makeup artist wouldn\u2019t be able to step away to another room to do yours, also understandable that this would be up to you.\n\nGender Identity- Honestly, weddings are not the type of place to experiment or try out something. I fully respect you as a gender-fluid man, but she shouldn\u2019t have to try and figure that out on her wedding day. \n\nConclusion- It\u2019s probably for the better that you stepped down from maid of honor, if you were offended by her choices, which I would understand if you were, then it\u2019s probably better to not be in that position. At the end of the day, it\u2019s her wedding, but you gotta do what you\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nNAH", "I\u2019m not sure how to feel but ultimately I think your friend shouldn\u2019t have asked you to be MOH if they weren\u2019t willing to make fair compromises. Like I understand why she might not want you in the dressing room but you should at least be able to come in and use the same makeup artist as everyone else. MOH is supposed to stand out from the other bridesmaids so the color isn\u2019t the issue, the issue is that she could have found a suit that fit you better", "NTA.

NAH.", "I would be willing to bet that she felt like she was putting too much of her focus on you.\n\nI read through a couple of times and get the impression that, by trying to be flexible, you came across as non-committal, which can be frustrating when you need decisions to be made and stuck with, and for those decisions not to come into question later on.\n\nYou said you tried on the suit, didn\u2019t like the fit or look, but were trying to appease the bride so were willing to just go with it. I don\u2019t get a sense that you were an active participant by offering suggestions on how to take her idea and make it work for you. The makeup decision might have been an extension of that - she felt she couldn\u2019t make you happy so wanted to leave it to you. \n\nI think she was looking for a collaborative effort, wasn\u2019t getting what she felt was enough of one and was sensing you were unhappy with her decisions, and finally just didn\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.

It isn\u2019t her responsibility to dissect how you feel about yourself constantly.

I would suggest that there are likely family politics going on in the background with which you are not aware.  They have probably had a lot of pressure from one or more of their family who do not understand or empathize with you. The lead up to weddings brings out the worst in your biological family members, they like to have an opinion and input on everything. \n\nThis is a tough situation for your friendship to navigate, there is no easy way to navigate through this situation.  Good luck.", "NTA. I fail to see how you asking is a bad thing.", "NTA\n\nLet's note that OP writes things to us here and I take it all into account... OP was excluded from the bridal party after not making a fuss about anything! I mean... OP was going to wear a suit, was going to do their own makeup, was going to be separate from the others... of course OP was going to ask the Bride privately what this was about!\n\nAlso, this is no friend, and I'm sorry about that, OP.", "YTA, I know I'm gonna be downwoted, but I get your friend....\n\nYou can identify as anything and she seems supportive, which is great. But if I were in her shoes, I wouldn't want a man in a dress, wearing full face makup as my the bridesmaid. First, not all the family and friends will be supportive of this arrangement and understanding as your friend is, second - there would be pictures of the wedding taken for long memory and what not and well... Not everyone would like to see a man in a dress in them. This wedding is about her and reh SO, not you and you identity.\n\nAgain, you may identify as anything and you friend seems supportive, but it's obvious that she tried to be inclusiy while keeping her vision of the wedding and lowering any drama. You just didn't get her hints.", "YTA. You can identify as you want, but you ARE different from other bridesmaids, this is a fact, so it is weird that you expect other people to pretend you are not. You give this \"I am the main character\" vibe, tbh.", "NTA and honestly i get the vibe your \u201cbest friend\u201d does have issues with your gender fluidity.", "YTA. You have every right to identify how you want and it sounds like your friend has been supportive. This is her day though and it would be naive of you to think that a man in a dress and full face of makeup would not take away from her at the wedding. Firstly because you\u2019ve explained this is a new side of you and that you\u2019ve mostly presented male. That\u2019s how she abd her family are likely used to seeing you. Secondly, weddings often include a wider birth of guests meaning extended family and friends that maybe aren\u2019t often around. People that maybe wouldn\u2019t be as accepting. It\u2019s not wrong of her to not want drama or a spectacle at her wedding. She tried to include you. She made you her maid of honor. You made it about you when you started caring more about what you wanted to wear and present as instead of allowing her the vision she had for her day. And not for nothing but the moh often wears a completely different style/color Ryan the bridesmaids. It\u2019s a way if you standing out and being acknowledged as someone special, that you are the bestie/HBIC, it wasn\u2019t something exclusionary, but you made it that way.", "YTA. You are making your friends wedding about you. You said you were fine with a suit,  then complain the ones you looked at were baggy,  which is weak sauce since tailors exist for a reason. Plus mist MOHs wear different colors/cuts so everyone knows who they are.\n\nThen you complain about makeup,  which beyond the basics what do you need? Also most makeup people know how to do female skin/faces,  not male skin/faces,  do you expect her to have two MUA? Or spend time and money finding one who can do both? \n\nYou seem high maintenance,  I think best friend is right and both she and bride just \"cant deal with you right now\".", "YTA\n\nI understand that you're born male but steer towards a female side.\n\nHowever you stated that you will wear whatever the bride ask you to wear, suit or dress, but then gets mad/ bothered that she wants you to wear a suit. Then you complain that the suit looks baggy and is a different color. Plenty of people get their suits tailored to fit them. Also plenty of MOH wear a different color then the other bridesmaids.\n\nThen you complained about not being able to be in the get ready room the day of. However you have to understand that a lot of women aren't comfortable getting ready, (where they might be in their underwear), in front of a strange man (because at the end of the day you were born male).\n\nThen you complained about not being able to use the makeup artist and honestly unless you were trying to get a full face of makeup it would be a waste of money, since most charge per person for a full face.\n\nIt sucks but I honestly get why the bride asked you to step down. She's already stressed about her wedding, you as MOH wasn't doing anything but adding to the stress.", "A woman will still be a woman in a suit, also oversized suits for women are everywhere!! You don't become a woman by putting on a dress. Please stop making a joke out of women. You would've look nice and feminine also in a suit by not only your looks but also your behavior. It seems you need others to validate you for you to feel good about yourself and your friend had enough about you making her wedding about yourself. She started putting you aside because on her wedding day she wanted to feel relaxed and you seemed a bit unsure about yourself and probably didn't want to have to guide you about your feelings on her day. YTA a bit", "ESH - I think by trying to be accommodating you actually caused more problems/frustrations for the bride. \n\nWeddings are a big PITA, especially for the bride, who - let's be honest - is probably doing most of the planning and coordinating for the entire wedding on her own (they might have a planner but still). Given how things have gone, she'd be more focused on your needs than her own wedding day with you as MOH - that's why you got asked to step down. \n\nWas it fair that they did this close to the wedding? No. But I don't think you're as \"go-with-the-flow\" as you made yourself out be. \n\nEveryone in here making some wildly inappropriate comments are majorly TA though.", "YTA.

Dont see it as a bonding or socialising, see it as something more practical. You have short hair (*pic in post history) and so won't need the same hair styling. Wigs are often pre-styled and require different skills. Even makeup is different, if you feminize your face, that's a different style.\n\nThe reason why you weren't included is because you already agreed you'd be wearing a suit. It's a different process. They might see you questioning that as changing things last minute and causing drama.\n\nI could be wrong of course, but something to consider.", "I'm going with NTA. I've been in your shoes, except for the gender fluid part and maid of honor.  My best friend asked me to be one of her bridesmaids, and I was included in everything. My suit matched the bridesmaids' dresses, though i was willing to wear a dress, I went to the Bachelorette party, and I even had my makeup done the day of, obviously not as heavy I think this has more to do with the bride thinking it was a good idea and found it too complicated and decided to ask you to bow out. Also, I don't know if you have ever tried suits on before, but generally, the ones you try on are a little baggy and then fitted to match, at least in my experience.", "NTA (I guess lightly) and this sucks.

And realistically, since you state it\u2019s only recently you\u2019ve been leaning more towards feminine, it\u2019s understandable that your friend may not want you in the same dressing room while getting ready. If you friend is used to you presenting as male, she may still have that feeling, even if she\u2019s accepting of your feminine leaning, of not wanting a male presence at that particular time.

Hair and makeup were offered (but she does her own very well), and we had separate rooms to change. \n\nFFS, I couldn't imagine not standing up for someone who meant so much to me. She looked absolutely stunning and was so happy(Pictures were fantastic). My wedding was about me getting married and having a lovely time with the people I love very much. The closest of them being in my bridal party. \n\nAs for the comments about making it about gender get real. If a cis individual was being excluded, kept away from the bridal party, and left on their own to do hair/makeup, they would have similar feelings of why am I being left out as well. Are they not pretty or nice enough that I am not wanted? It is just not nice of a bride to do that imo.\n\nOP - You deserve more. Being excluded by your friend after being asked is for sure painful. Do what makes you feel comfortable. Forgive her if you feel you can without resentment, but know you deserve to be treated with kindness and respect always. Definitely NTA", "YTA. You are honestly detracting attention from the bride and the bridal party. Based on your past posts, your feminine style is extremely attention seeking and your makeup is inappropriate.

It sounds like Best Friend (not worthy of that title but for the sake of clarity) isn't taking the time and space to think about you as a person.

She just didn't want to own her feelings by putting them into words.", "You do know the suit you try on is just an example right? And then they measure you and make it fit right and not look baggy?", "NAH\n\nYou're both in a tough spot.  I get that you're feeling left out and that it possibly has to do with your gender.  But at the same time, maybe she's hurt that you're even questioning that it's about your gender given that she asked you to be MoH to begin with.\n\nAlso, you did tell her that you will wear whatever she wanted and are now objecting to it.  She's probably overwhelmed and doesn't want to deal with your insecurities as her wedding approaches.", "This one is tough. My guess is that the bride didn\u2019t consider the possible reactions to having a genderfluid maid of honor and just asked the people she was closest to, because she loves them. Maybe now she\u2019s thinking that you will attract more attention than she wants to share on her wedding day and she\u2019s feeling more selfish than she did initially. Even ugly duckling brides want to feel like the belle of the ball on their wedding day and set aside reality for a day. That doesn\u2019t mean that what she\u2019s doing isn\u2019t hurtful or wrong. I had a fairly traditional style wedding but didn\u2019t care for the big bridal party stuff so my husband had his best man and I had a maid of honor and a best man. My best man was gay but is cisgender. He was happy to wear the suit my husband chose but he was with me and my MOH at the venue in the bridal suite. He didn\u2019t stay with us the whole time because he didn\u2019t need or want his hair and make up done so he wandered in and out and played the organ while pretending to be the phantom of the opera. He did also jump in to assist  my MOH to fix my bustle after my MIL stepped on my dress and ripped it during the reception, but he didn\u2019t come with me to the bathroom to check if I needed help with holding up my skirt (I didn\u2019t). \ud83d\ude06 I\u2019m sorry that your friend is not being as accepting as you thought she would be.

While I can appreciate her trying to shield me from that, if it makes the whole scenario easier I'm happy to just fully present as male on the day.", "Then why would she ask OP to be MoH to begin with?", "THIS", "Not sure why this isn't higher.

That's on her.", "Outfit- OP said they didn't mind the suit, but on top of not fitting any cohesive theme, it also didn't fit them properly, and there was no budget for tailoring. Why make OP wear an ill-fitted suit that doesn't go with anything discernable to the wedding party? They also acknowledged it's the bride's choice, but they get to have an opinion for a suit they're paying for.\n\nGetting Ready- Everyone could get ready before OP and just have them come in for makeup/pictures or have OP come in prior to everyone getting ready. The problem here is again that the Best Friend didn't talk to OP about any of this. If she'd said \"Hey, some of the bridesmaids are uncomfortable with you being in the room with us while we get ready\" that'd be one thing, but she sprung it on OP and just expected them to deal with it. That's also more time and money OP has to spend to be alienated from the experience.\n\nGender Identity- There's nothing experimental going on here. OP said they're leaning more feminine and the only thing Bride has to navigate is saying the correct set of pronouns, nothing more and nothing less. If that's too hard for her to do on her wedding day, she's in deep shit because all of her guests have pronouns. Also, why would a wedding not be somewhere to try something new out? Not every wedding is super stuffy and conservative in traditions, some people like to try new things with their weddings.\n\nConclusion- Best Friend should've communicated the dismissal she'd be showing OP's gender identity and the alienation they may face if they agreed to be MOH. OP should for sure step down and reevaluate this friendship because if respecting their identity is \"too hard for her wedding day\", Best Friend is not as supportive as OP thought she was.", "OP said that they are genderfluid, not a man.\n\nAMAB =/= man", "This is the bride-to-be\u2019s best friend and maid of honor, not a random man in a dress.
