I wanted to know why this was the case, but mostly I just wanted to know it wasn't because of my gender (both the gender I was born as and my gender identity).

To me it sounds like she realized that people would be making more of a fuss about you on her big day, and the attention would be off of her.", "Wow so many bigoted comments, it\u2019s awful. OP you\u2019re so NTA for expressing your feelings to your friend. It doesn\u2019t sound like you were insisting on anything or making it about you. You had a legitimate sense that you were being left out & othered because of your gender identity. I\u2019m sorry your friend is doing this to you and that so many people are being horrible in the comments.", "I'm going to guess that, behind the scenes, your presence in the bridal party is becoming an issue for her family and her other guests -- especially now that you're shifting more towards your feminine side and that you asked to wear a dress. Also, I'm not sure how comfortable she is with a sexual-male (i.e., not based on gender) being in her room as she dresses on her wedding day.\n\nI think that, rather than allowing her wedding to become a battleground for gender politics, she has opted to exclude you from the bridal party.\n\n1. Regardless what I may think, you can be gracious and accept her decisions. Of course, it is your prerogative to decline to go to the wedding if you feel strongly enough; on the other hand, it seems to me that you could wear a dress now that you're freed from the shackles of the wedding party(!).\n2. Or you can continue to question her decisions and place your friendship in jeopardy.\n\nNAH", "These comments are not it\u2026", "I'll have to go NAH.\n\nI think the bride had other things to worry about besides the issues you had and therefore made a judgement call to have you step down. I think it's within her rights to do that because she probably didn't have the capacity to find a compromise shortly before the wedding (if she even did want to compromise).\n\nI think this sucks for you because you wanted to dress feminine while (judging from your comments) being more masculine presenting to the unknowing eye. So that probably creates a whole lot of problems for you, on a daily basis. So I get why you would be hurt that she didn't want to deter from her personal plans.\n\nSo all in all I think this is just an unfortunate situation for everyone. It doesn't sound like bride wanted to hurt you, and I don't think it's unreasonable for you to feel uncomfortable whith the whole situation.", "NTA - I don\u2019t know what is up with these comments.  I think the bride doesn\u2019t want any drama at her wedding and I get that, but I don\u2019t think she\u2019s really your friend.  I would throw down against bigots in my family to have my Maid of Honor be themselves.  She should never have asked you if she wasn\u2019t prepared for the comments, because judgy people are going to be assholes.  I also agree that you were being excluded and while if she discussed any of these decisions with you privately and ahead of time, I might have cut her some slack.  But the delivery and the attitude make her the asshole here.  I\u2019m sorry this happened to you.", "I\u2019m gonna break it down a bit.\n\nOutfit- First off, it\u2019s pretty common that the maid of honor would be dressed differently than the rest of the party, whether it be a different style or color. Whether it was a suit or not, and ultimately it is the brides choice. \n\nGetting ready- Ultimately, from the get go of the post you identified yourself as a man, gender-fluid but overall, a male. Any girls getting ready with her might not feel comfortable with a guy in the room, people changing or zippers or anything, you get what I\u2019m saying. Since the makeup artist wouldn\u2019t be able to step away to another room to do yours, also understandable that this would be up to you.\n\nGender Identity- Honestly, weddings are not the type of place to experiment or try out something. I fully respect you as a gender-fluid man, but she shouldn\u2019t have to try and figure that out on her wedding day. \n\nConclusion- It\u2019s probably for the better that you stepped down from maid of honor, if you were offended by her choices, which I would understand if you were, then it\u2019s probably better to not be in that position. At the end of the day, it\u2019s her wedding, but you gotta do what you\u2019re comfortable with.\n\nNAH", "I\u2019m not sure how to feel but ultimately I think your friend shouldn\u2019t have asked you to be MOH if they weren\u2019t willing to make fair compromises. Like I understand why she might not want you in the dressing room but you should at least be able to come in and use the same makeup artist as everyone else. MOH is supposed to stand out from the other bridesmaids so the color isn\u2019t the issue, the issue is that she could have found a suit that fit you better", "NTA.

NAH.", "I would be willing to bet that she felt like she was putting too much of her focus on you.\n\nI read through a couple of times and get the impression that, by trying to be flexible, you came across as non-committal, which can be frustrating when you need decisions to be made and stuck with, and for those decisions not to come into question later on.\n\nYou said you tried on the suit, didn\u2019t like the fit or look, but were trying to appease the bride so were willing to just go with it. I don\u2019t get a sense that you were an active participant by offering suggestions on how to take her idea and make it work for you. The makeup decision might have been an extension of that - she felt she couldn\u2019t make you happy so wanted to leave it to you. \n\nI think she was looking for a collaborative effort, wasn\u2019t getting what she felt was enough of one and was sensing you were unhappy with her decisions, and finally just didn\u2019t want to deal with it anymore.

It isn\u2019t her responsibility to dissect how you feel about yourself constantly.

I would suggest that there are likely family politics going on in the background with which you are not aware.  They have probably had a lot of pressure from one or more of their family who do not understand or empathize with you. The lead up to weddings brings out the worst in your biological family members, they like to have an opinion and input on everything. \n\nThis is a tough situation for your friendship to navigate, there is no easy way to navigate through this situation.  Good luck.", "NTA. I fail to see how you asking is a bad thing.", "NTA\n\nLet's note that OP writes things to us here and I take it all into account... OP was excluded from the bridal party after not making a fuss about anything! I mean... OP was going to wear a suit, was going to do their own makeup, was going to be separate from the others... of course OP was going to ask the Bride privately what this was about!\n\nAlso, this is no friend, and I'm sorry about that, OP.", "YTA, I know I'm gonna be downwoted, but I get your friend....\n\nYou can identify as anything and she seems supportive, which is great. But if I were in her shoes, I wouldn't want a man in a dress, wearing full face makup as my the bridesmaid. First, not all the family and friends will be supportive of this arrangement and understanding as your friend is, second - there would be pictures of the wedding taken for long memory and what not and well... Not everyone would like to see a man in a dress in them. This wedding is about her and reh SO, not you and you identity.\n\nAgain, you may identify as anything and you friend seems supportive, but it's obvious that she tried to be inclusiy while keeping her vision of the wedding and lowering any drama. You just didn't get her hints.", "YTA. You can identify as you want, but you ARE different from other bridesmaids, this is a fact, so it is weird that you expect other people to pretend you are not. You give this \"I am the main character\" vibe, tbh.", "NTA and honestly i get the vibe your \u201cbest friend\u201d does have issues with your gender fluidity.", "YTA. You have every right to identify how you want and it sounds like your friend has been supportive. This is her day though and it would be naive of you to think that a man in a dress and full face of makeup would not take away from her at the wedding. Firstly because you\u2019ve explained this is a new side of you and that you\u2019ve mostly presented male. That\u2019s how she abd her family are likely used to seeing you. Secondly, weddings often include a wider birth of guests meaning extended family and friends that maybe aren\u2019t often around. People that maybe wouldn\u2019t be as accepting. It\u2019s not wrong of her to not want drama or a spectacle at her wedding. She tried to include you. She made you her maid of honor. You made it about you when you started caring more about what you wanted to wear and present as instead of allowing her the vision she had for her day. And not for nothing but the moh often wears a completely different style/color Ryan the bridesmaids. It\u2019s a way if you standing out and being acknowledged as someone special, that you are the bestie/HBIC, it wasn\u2019t something exclusionary, but you made it that way.", "YTA. You are making your friends wedding about you. You said you were fine with a suit,  then complain the ones you looked at were baggy,  which is weak sauce since tailors exist for a reason. Plus mist MOHs wear different colors/cuts so everyone knows who they are.\n\nThen you complain about makeup,  which beyond the basics what do you need? Also most makeup people know how to do female skin/faces,  not male skin/faces,  do you expect her to have two MUA? Or spend time and money finding one who can do both? \n\nYou seem high maintenance,  I think best friend is right and both she and bride just \"cant deal with you right now\".", "YTA\n\nI understand that you're born male but steer towards a female side.\n\nHowever you stated that you will wear whatever the bride ask you to wear, suit or dress, but then gets mad/ bothered that she wants you to wear a suit. Then you complain that the suit looks baggy and is a different color. Plenty of people get their suits tailored to fit them. Also plenty of MOH wear a different color then the other bridesmaids.\n\nThen you complained about not being able to be in the get ready room the day of. However you have to understand that a lot of women aren't comfortable getting ready, (where they might be in their underwear), in front of a strange man (because at the end of the day you were born male).\n\nThen you complained about not being able to use the makeup artist and honestly unless you were trying to get a full face of makeup it would be a waste of money, since most charge per person for a full face.\n\nIt sucks but I honestly get why the bride asked you to step down. She's already stressed about her wedding, you as MOH wasn't doing anything but adding to the stress.", "A woman will still be a woman in a suit, also oversized suits for women are everywhere!! You don't become a woman by putting on a dress. Please stop making a joke out of women. You would've look nice and feminine also in a suit by not only your looks but also your behavior. It seems you need others to validate you for you to feel good about yourself and your friend had enough about you making her wedding about yourself. She started putting you aside because on her wedding day she wanted to feel relaxed and you seemed a bit unsure about yourself and probably didn't want to have to guide you about your feelings on her day. YTA a bit", "ESH - I think by trying to be accommodating you actually caused more problems/frustrations for the bride. \n\nWeddings are a big PITA, especially for the bride, who - let's be honest - is probably doing most of the planning and coordinating for the entire wedding on her own (they might have a planner but still). Given how things have gone, she'd be more focused on your needs than her own wedding day with you as MOH - that's why you got asked to step down. \n\nWas it fair that they did this close to the wedding? No. But I don't think you're as \"go-with-the-flow\" as you made yourself out be. \n\nEveryone in here making some wildly inappropriate comments are majorly TA though.", "YTA.

Dont see it as a bonding or socialising, see it as something more practical. You have short hair (*pic in post history) and so won't need the same hair styling. Wigs are often pre-styled and require different skills. Even makeup is different, if you feminize your face, that's a different style.\n\nThe reason why you weren't included is because you already agreed you'd be wearing a suit. It's a different process. They might see you questioning that as changing things last minute and causing drama.\n\nI could be wrong of course, but something to consider.", "I'm going with NTA. I've been in your shoes, except for the gender fluid part and maid of honor.  My best friend asked me to be one of her bridesmaids, and I was included in everything. My suit matched the bridesmaids' dresses, though i was willing to wear a dress, I went to the Bachelorette party, and I even had my makeup done the day of, obviously not as heavy I think this has more to do with the bride thinking it was a good idea and found it too complicated and decided to ask you to bow out. Also, I don't know if you have ever tried suits on before, but generally, the ones you try on are a little baggy and then fitted to match, at least in my experience.", "NTA (I guess lightly) and this sucks.

And realistically, since you state it\u2019s only recently you\u2019ve been leaning more towards feminine, it\u2019s understandable that your friend may not want you in the same dressing room while getting ready. If you friend is used to you presenting as male, she may still have that feeling, even if she\u2019s accepting of your feminine leaning, of not wanting a male presence at that particular time.

Maybe a nice bright dress \ud83d\ude09.\n\nOr ditch the wedding all together. it's interesting how supportive some friends are until they have to do it publicly and get social pressure from others.", "People having a different opinion from you is not \"being horrible in the comments\". \n\nDon't want others to disagree with you or maybe hurt your feelings? Don't post stories asking for honest opinions and judgement on an internet forum.", "Ong", "Just to clarify, I did state I would wear what she wanted me to. We had a discussion a while back about what I would prefer and I was honest with her, but I did also make it very clear that she's the one who picks, not me.\n\nAs for her getting changed: I'm not expecting to be chained to her the whole day, and I would fully expect and understand if she asked her other bridesmaid to help her get changed, for the reasons you stated above.\n\nThanks for asking these so I could clarify!", "This was distressing to read! All these comments saying that the bride\u2019s \u201ccomfort\u201d is more important than caring for her friend?

OP told her directly what their needs and desires are. \n\nSome of y\u2019all in the comments really need to do some introspection. Would you really exclude your *best friend*, someone worthy of being your maid of honor, because of their gender identity? Someone who you\u2019ve known and loved for years?", "She fr gave op different colors and exclude them out of brides maid thigy.", "I'm non binary and yes honestly. The reality is that spaces don't exist for non binary people but it isn't up to individuals to create those spaces. It'd be nice but it sounds like the friend tried as much as she was comfortable. \n\nIt sucks and it's messy and it's not fair.", "I appreciate this, but I think it might be worth reading my post again.\n\n1. I stated what I'd rather wear, but made it clear to Best Friend that it's her wedding and she chooses.\n2. She still wanted me in makeup, but wanted me to do my own instead of joining the others with the Makeup Artist\n\nThe reason I felt left out wasn't \"I don't get to wear a dress', but a multitude of things which differed me from the bridal party.", "I think they are NTA for asking but I think your reply probably hits the nail on the head why the bride has been asking about suit etc\u2026\n\n\u2026.she probably was supportive of her friend but doesn\u2019t totally buy into her friend\u2019s identity and doesn\u2019t want it to be what she would see as a distraction at her wedding.", "Okay but Best Friend asked OP to be her Maid of Honor. So. There probably should have been an expectation, especially knowing that OP is gender-fluid and leaning feminine, that OP would dress similarly to the other bridesmaid. You know, in a dress. With makeup. If this was going to be an issue, she shouldn\u2019t have asked OP to be her MAID of honor. NTA because this whole issue could have been avoided if Best Friend had put any thought into this situation before asking OP to be her maid of honor.", "Girl what", "Just to clarify: I've been Genderfluid for well over a decade now. This isn't something new for either of us.\n\nI have also stated in the OP that she didn't ask me NOT to wear makeup, but instead that I should do my own.", "\u201cMan in a dress\u201d \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d", "Girl.. are you okay", "For years a topic between friends and settled as far as I read it.

My issue is about being excluded.", "Thanks for this, helps me clarify a few things.\n\n1. I didn't mention hair since I wouldn't be getting mine done regardless, my hair is quite androgynous to begin with and doesn't pose an issue regardless of how I present.\n2. I understand what you mean with makeup, however having done my own a fair few times, as well as working with a lot of makeup artists, I can confirm that any qualified makeup artist will now how to contour and colour correct to hide away more masculine features.", "Nothing people just know the difference between someone being treated badly because of how they identify, and people being insufferable and saying it must be because of how they identify. \n\nIts not the OPs wedding. They're adding an extra headace for no actual reason", "For a minute there I thought it was just me being sensitive.\n\nGranted a fair few \"YTA\" comments have made fair points and I do appreciate them, but there's been a fair bit of \"ew bloke in a dress\".", "They are fluid and don't need to decide shit to please you! \n\nI found the real asshole here!", "Eh?", "No having a different opinion is not being horrible. Being bigoted because of someone\u2019s gender identity is.", "You may have said that you would accept it; but you continue to question why she is making her decisions.  That does not come off as accepting.", "I think your friend supports you still, but may have been forced to exclude you because her bridesmaids do not feel comfortable having you there when they\u2019re getting ready. They will all be in robes, getting hair and make-up done, they may all get dressed together etc. Not all women are comfortable with having a sexual-male around, especially if they don\u2019t know you.  \n\nI think she should have been clearer with you from the beginning, and you should have maybe asked if you\u2019d be fully involved in all activities. If you\u2019d rather not attend the wedding at all because you\u2019re offended, that\u2019s fair. But I think your friend has also not clarified why she excluded you, because she didn\u2019t want to hurt you, and she was frustrated you weren\u2019t more understanding regarding her decisions. It\u2019s likely she\u2019d had pressure by her bridesmaids and family and hence, she decided to drop you from the bridal party.\n\nNAH", "Then why are you whining about the suit?", "Who calls someone their best friend and then tells them they\u2019re no longer a valuable MOH because of what they want to wear \ud83d\ude2d", "How did you decide that OP is bride's best friend? You being my best friend doesn't make me your best friend.", "Let\u2019s break it down a little.\n\nOutfit - you prefer dress, she prefers suit. You try on dresses anyway so now she feels pressure. She insists on suit, you complain it\u2019s different than everyone else etc. This probably felt like excuses.\n\nI can see you were excited and most likely sincerely meant the suit wasn\u2019t what you expected. But that needs to be clearer to the bride who is also trying to wrangle 473868376 other things.\n\nWedding party - While I don\u2019t care what you have between your legs, they might. So might their partners. They\u2019re getting ready in that room and that means walking around in potentially next to nothing while wardrobe fixes happen and zippers get stuck. The bride cannot force every person to be comfortable with you in the room. While that\u2019s sad, it\u2019s a different conversation that maybe should have happened a little earlier on so other plans could be made.\n\nMakeup - Again we have the issue from above. Usually makeup is being done on one while another dresses. If they aren\u2019t comfortable, that can\u2019t be helped. Has makeup ever been discussed? Did she do a makeup trial or send you looks to try out so you were all on the same page of how much makeup she was comfortable with? Maybe she doesn\u2019t want you in makeup, maybe she doesn\u2019t know how to tell you she wants subtle etc.\n\nUltimately NAH - you should have both been clearer and communicated sooner.", "Yeah, you stated it's up to her to choose the outfit, she chose a suit and you were not happy (as you stated yourself). \nAbout the makeup, I don't think she expected you have a full face makeup and that's why he asked you to do it yourself. My guess, her wedding make-up artist only works with women? Anywhay, I passed my judgement, there's no need to try and prove me wrong. Just dismiss it, if you don't agree", "It's common for men to have some makeup on for events like weddings.  It's also not uncommon for makeup artists to specialize.\n\nIf you were a trans woman this might be different. The reality is that you are sometimes still a man, and you have to accept that women will not feel comfortable with you the way they do with women who are always women.\n\nWomen's makeup often costs more and she probably knows you can do your own. And yes it's reasonable for women not to be comfortable getting changed and dressed around a person who is, at least sometimes, a man.\n\nThis is not discrimination. \n\nYou're being excluded from women-only events because you are not a woman only.", "I\u2019m sorry, but this is really not about you. You have a very clear path here: do what the bride asks you without drawing attention to yourself on HER special day, go as a guest without drawing attention to yourself on HER special day, don\u2019t go and don\u2019t draw attention to yourself on HER special day. \n\nYta", "NTA. Bride could have picked a suit you both liked and a shirt the same color as the other BM\u2019s dress; then you would have matched and looked like you were included. \nI would have no issue with you being in the \u201cglam room\u201d. You could always cover your eyes or go to a separate area if someone had to change. \nI think your friend hasn\u2019t come to terms with the newer you yet.", "She just shouldn\u2019t have asked you if she didn\u2019t want to commit to you being her MoH. NTA and this thread is full of bullshit transphobia.", "Oh, yeah, you are right, I passed the judgement on the whole situation, but if we talk about just asking, they are N T A.", "I was confused about this, too. Maid implies feminine, so I assumed OP would wear a dress. I don\u2019t know why they weren\u2019t called Person of Honor. It\u2019s a bit of a moot point, but I think it contributed to some confusion.", "I'm not clear why you think being genderfluid makes you entitled to women-only spaces when you aren't a woman only.", "Yes but you also stated that you\u2019ve been more of your femme side recently. Again, either way it seems she gave subtle hints of how\u2019d she would like you to be on the day and you pushed back. I feel like you not being included in makeup was a sign not to wear any so then it became well I guess if you really need to wear makeup do your own \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2640\ufe0f  maybe the other bridesmaid was uncomfortable getting dressed with a man? Who knows. Weddings are stressful enough without having to navigate the wedding party\u2019s feelings on wardrobe. She tried, you wanted it your way so she removed the stress.", "OP, you don\u2019t need to explain yourself to bigots. Ignore these commenters and (hopefully former) friend. Find people who celebrate you, not tolerate you.", "this commenter's idea of a trans/gf person must be something like Corporal Klinger...", "I don\u2019t get it as settled especially because OP doesn\u2019t appear to see it as settled and has been changing themselves. Have mentioned that in my comment above as well. OP doesn\u2019t seem settled and that\u2019s fine, but their friend seems to have a lot going on and hence took the call to leave OP out.", "It's not that short or androgynous hair would present bad, cis girls have short hair too of course, it's literally that there's a small, chaotic window for everyone to get ready. If you're not getting the same style done as the others then the wasn't any point you being there and could have met them afterwards. This might be cold but it makes sense to me that you'd do your contouring etc because the process is different and takes twice as long. Wedding morning are nuts, any little helps.\n\nThough saying all that, she seemed pretty quick to drop you rather than reassure you so that's not great.", "Take a look at the picture as a whole. If it was just the suit, or just the makeup, or just not being with the bridal party, I wouldn't be feeling as excluded. It is everything all together, not the individual parts.", "The bride chose OP as maid of honor for a reason. Usually BFFs is the reason. Maybe in your universe the bride lost a bet?", "Because the bride chose OP as her Maid of Honor.", " Bride asking OP to be Maid of Honor is sort of indicative, though.", "It's not the between the legs here.  If op were a trans woman and living full time as a woman it'd be a different story.\n\nBut the reality is op still is, at least sometimes, a man, and op needs to accept that they're not going to be treated as a full-time woman when they aren't one.", "I'm not at any point asking to be in the changing rooms with anyone. The bridal party are getting ready in a house, not a single room, and there are private spaces there for everyone, including the men (not me) that will be there.", ".. what woman only spaces\u2026??", "The transphobia in this comment section is pure insanity", "The little details add up, your NTA and your feelings are valid.\n\nI'm sorry you're going through this. Seems she was happy to support you behind closed doors but now it's out in public and others are pressuring her she has shown how far she is willing to support you.\n\nOthers here seem to be struggling with the idea of non- conforming gender norms. To them, ofc you wouldn't be wearing makeup if you weren't in a dress!  So they might struggle to see why you would expect to be included in those bits anyway.", "NTA. I think a lot of these comments are going Y T A are either looking at this incorrectly or possibly just transphobic.\n\nThis is not some political gender issue, this is a friendship with someone who is well aware and supposedly supports your identity. Is it not very odd for a maid of honor to be excluded from some of these things like make-up, bridal party, and even not wearing a dress. \n\nLots of comments saying she is likely worried about the attention you'll gather and that she doesn't want a man in a dress as her maid of honor. That would be putting the opinions of bigots over one of her closest friends. It's unfortunately common for queer people and I see posts about it a lot on this sub. \n\nObviously this is just based on the context you gave, but assuming it's unbiased then NTA.", "As far as the suit goes, I don't think you should consider it a negative point about your treatment on this issue.\n\nBridal clothing of all genders needs to be heavily tailored to fit right. You buy what's closest to your size and get it altered. You'd need that whether you have a suit or a dress, so I wouldn't consider that a slight against you.\n\nThe other stuff is sus though. Especially if your makeup style is typically femme and would be similar to the others.", "Like others have said, even though she\u2019s supportive of you and asked you to be her maid of honour, not everyone is as accepting and supportive. She wanted you there because you\u2019re her best friend. However, she may well have been pressure by her bridesmaids and family to drop you because of your tacit insistence to wear a dress and makeup. Your friend possibly expected from you to be more understanding, and adhere to her choices, which she probably thought long and hard about.\n\nIt was her fault that she hadn\u2019t told you in advance that you\u2019d have to perhaps conform more to your assigned-at-birth sex and not your gender, for this wedding, and you should have clarified that you\u2019re more intent on wearing a dress.", "Yeah it could also mean that OP repeated 294848 times omg you're my best friend am I going to be your maid of honour? Am I? Am I?\nMaybe they were close enough for the bride to choose them over another close friend. That doesn't automatically make them a best friend. People do ridiculous stuff to save their friendship.\nEdit: not to mention based on OP's post the bride seems to be stomping the foot a bit which, idk about you, I wouldn't be doing with my closest person.", "That may be it. But also some people may not even be comfortable with trans if they\u2019re pre-op. I don\u2019t know them so I can\u2019t say for certain. Unfortunately some people may even have the same feelings some lesbian/bi being in the room.\n\nHeck I spent high school having to change in the stage behind the curtain with a guy friend because he was gay and I was bi so therefor we couldn\u2019t be put in changing rooms as it apparently made others uncomfortable.", "You gotta be slow", "This is a big stretch. A really big stretch. You\u2019re just making things up to support your point, but there\u2019s no indication that this is true, nor that Bride is the sort of person that would pity-choose a MOH.  I mean, I\u2019d we\u2019re just writing fiction here, maybe it was because OP thought the moon was made of green cheese and Bride thought that was cute."]}
