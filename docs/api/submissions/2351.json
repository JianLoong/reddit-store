We have been together 4 years now. The first time they met my gf brought food over to my mom\u2019s for a potluck type of deal. My gf is a very quiet, anxious and introverted person and I think my mom didn\u2019t like that. In the beginning gf really wanted my mom to like her so she invited my mom to lunch after the potluck. My mom said she was busy and then used gf\u2019s phone number from the text to google and found some personal info about gf that I already knew. My parents then called me and tried to use this info to get me to break up with her. They have also called her names, and made assumptions even though they don\u2019t really know her. I do acknowledge this is their fault. Since this happened they have just not gotten along. Gf has avoided them which has been no big deal because they live in another state.\n\nMy parents have made some financial missteps and need somewhere to stay. They asked me about a month ago if they could stay with us for a few months because they know we have a spare room. I talked to gf about it and she was definitely weary but she agreed on two conditions: 1) We have a big talk about everything that has happened *before* they move in so she can feel comfortable and 2) That they don\u2019t just immediately move in as soon as they get here.\n\nMy parents said this was fine because they planned to stay with a friend in our city for a week when they first got here so we\u2019d have time to talk before they moved in. \n\nWell, my parents ended up leaving about a few days early and the friend they were supposed to stay with had family over so they couldn\u2019t stay with them. They got here earlier than expected and didn\u2019t have anywhere to go so I didn\u2019t say anything. All four of us went out to dinner the first night and were supposed to talk about everything but I hadn\u2019t seen them in awhile so we spent the time just talking and catching up and I didn\u2019t end up bringing up any of the stuff gf wanted to talk about.\n\nMy parents have been here about 2 weeks now and my gf has been in our bedroom most of the time. She works from home so she literally hasn\u2019t left our room. I have tried to talk to her about everything but I have had to work and friends visiting from out of town this past week. She told me I \u201cmade her an outsider in her own home,\u201d and that I \u201cdon\u2019t care about her boundaries,\u201d which isn\u2019t true I love and want to marry her I just didn\u2019t know what else to do. \n\nMy mom did send her an apology text about what happened before about 5 days before they got here. gf doesn\u2019t think it was genuine because \u201cthey spent years ignoring me and are only apologizing now because they need a place to stay.\u201d \n\nMy gf is now saying she doesn\u2019t know if we will make it through this and idk if she is overreacting (she has an anxiety disorder and cptsd) or if I\u2019m in the wrong. AITA?\n\nEDIT: I get it. I fucked up. Please stop sending me Reddit Care Resources and telling me my girlfriend is going to make me homeless. She would never do that. To answer your questions, No, I\u2019m not on the deed and the info my mom found on gf was she used to be a sugar baby. They said she was \u201cmoney hungry\u201d. Your comments have made me realize I haven\u2019t been seeing my parents for who they are because I have been blinded by my love for them.", "created_utc": 1668459377, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yvccxa/aita_for_letting_my_parents_stay_when_they_had/", "score": 326, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You moved your parents, which have abused her for their entire relationship, into your home without doing the two very generous requests she had. You told her \"fuck you and your feelings, fuck you and your boundaries. What is convenient to my family goes and you should not only deal with it, but deal with it as a smiling hostess.\"\n\nShe is absolutely right that the apology text is totally invalid. Mom wants something, she got it. Mostly because she rightly assumed you would be a shitty boyfriend and bend over backwards for mom at the cost of her feelings. \n\nAnd given that your mom wants you two to break up, why ever would you assume she was acting in good faith?\n\nHonestly? I'd have left you the day they moved in like this. You blaming her legit concerns with your relationship on her mental health disorders is quite possibly the capstone on this pile of gross behavior.\n\nThe good news is that, when she leaves you next week you'll still have your financially unstable mommy and daddy hanging around your neck as an albatross to warn everyone else who you try to get close to about your lack of a spine.

You have found lots of excuses to avoid talking to your parents since they moved into your house. I am sure you would like to avoid what would be an extremely difficult conversation, if you were brave enough to say what should be said.  Your mother treated your girlfriend very poorly.  So poorly that a text message apology hardly seems sufficient.  But more importantly, what your girlfriend needs more than apology from your mom is an apology from you.  And not just for letting your parents bad behavior slide and not for being too chicken to confront them over their behavior (could you find any more lame excuses than \u201ccatching up,\u201d \u201cwork\u201d and \u201cfriends\u201d.) You need to apologize to her for ignoring her feelings and for insisting on a living situation that sounds open-ended even though you knew it would be very difficult for her.\n\nIf you sincerely apologize to her for your behavior, give your deadbeat parents a week to figure out how to take care of themselves and find someplace new to live AND hold them to that deadline, then maybe you won\u2019t lose her. If you don\u2019t do this, then I guess it won\u2019t matter how long your parents freeload off of you, because your girlfriend will be gone.", "YTA and do i need to explain why? she told you correctly. you made her an outsider in her own house. \n\nshe will dump you, and you will deserve it. if you want to try to prevent this, get your parents out. apologize to your poor gf.", "There aren't any hotels in your city, so you had to move your parents in EARLY, directly after you PROMISED your girlfriend that you would all talk like adults on neutral ground, to clear up the things that had happened in the past?  You move your parents into her safe space, where she can't even escape from to go to work, because she works from home?  And she's stuck with people who probably made a false apology because they needed something?  You've had several chances to put things right according to what you agreed to with your girlfriend.  You've messed up each time.  You put your parents ahead of her every time, and never listen to her concerns or feelings.  Best you listen really well, to the last thing you reported her saying:  you guys might not make it through this. \n\nYTA", "Your parent's made \"missteps\" financially? Um, they screwed up. That's on them, not you, not your gf. Sure, if you both... BOTH.. have a good relationship with them, helping them out is fine.\n\nThe problem is there ISN'T a good relationship between them and your gf. From your own account, your parents went out of their way to push her out of your life. And your gf is 100% correct; any apology NOW is only being done because they need a place to stay. \n\nAnd to top it all off? The \"plan\" got changed. They showed up early, forcing the friend to turn them away. So, they moved in early. THEN, instead of having that talk, to set boundaries, yeah no, that didn't happen either. \n\nSo, yeah, you're being the AH here, allowing your parents to dictate everything without you putting your foot down. You STILL haven't forced that talk, so no, you won't do it... eventually. \n\nYou've been with your gf for 4 years. Living together how long? 3-4 years? It's as much her house as yours. \n\nHelping family, parents, etc, is fine. Doing so to the detriment of your own life, that of your gf, isn't fine. Yes, being a prisoner in her own house, locked in the bedroom, so she doesn't have to deal with the very people that actively worked to get you to break up with her and spurned her SHOULD be a HUGE factor in deciding if she stayed with you or not. You just sided with the people who spurned her, parents or not, and made her lock herself in the bedroom in her own home. It would be for me were I in her shoes. You've already shown you don't have the fortitude TO put your foot down with your parents, won't do it, and worse, you let them walk over you AND her.", "YTA, she laid out her rules and you ignored them both. She deserves better from you.", "YTA...you put ZERO effort into making your gf comfortable with all of this and have simply dumped your parents on her.

Your family has, in your own words \"... I do acknowledge this is their fault...\" been extremely rude to her. She had 2 conditions to your parents moving in and neither were met.

We have been together 4 years now. The first time they met my gf brought food over to my mom\u2019s for a potluck type of deal. My gf is a very quiet, anxious and introverted person and I think my mom didn\u2019t like that. In the beginning gf really wanted my mom to like her so she invited my mom to lunch after the potluck. My mom said she was busy and then used gf\u2019s phone number from the text to google and found some personal info about gf that I already knew. My parents then called me and tried to use this info to get me to break up with her. They have also called her names, and made assumptions even though they don\u2019t really know her. I do acknowledge this is their fault. Since this happened they have just not gotten along. Gf has avoided them which has been no big deal because they live in another state.\n\nMy parents have made some financial missteps and need somewhere to stay. They asked me about a month ago if they could stay with us for a few months because they know we have a spare room. I talked to gf about it and she was definitely weary but she agreed on two conditions: 1) We have a big talk about everything that has happened *before* they move in so she can feel comfortable and 2) That they don\u2019t just immediately move in as soon as they get here.\n\nMy parents said this was fine because they planned to stay with a friend in our city for a week when they first got here so we\u2019d have time to talk before they moved in. \n\nWell, my parents ended up leaving about a few days early and the friend they were supposed to stay with had family over so they couldn\u2019t stay with them. They got here earlier than expected and didn\u2019t have anywhere to go so I didn\u2019t say anything. All four of us went out to dinner the first night and were supposed to talk about everything but I hadn\u2019t seen them in awhile so we spent the time just talking and catching up and I didn\u2019t end up bringing up any of the stuff gf wanted to talk about.\n\nMy parents have been here about 2 weeks now and my gf has been in our bedroom most of the time. She works from home so she literally hasn\u2019t left our room. I have tried to talk to her about everything but I have had to work and friends visiting from out of town this past week. She told me I \u201cmade her an outsider in her own home,\u201d and that I \u201cdon\u2019t care about her boundaries,\u201d which isn\u2019t true I love and want to marry her I just didn\u2019t know what else to do. \n\nMy mom did send her an apology text about what happened before about 5 days before they got here. gf doesn\u2019t think it was genuine because \u201cthey spent years ignoring me and are only apologizing now because they need a place to stay.\u201d \n\nMy gf is now saying she doesn\u2019t know if we will make it through this and idk if she is overreacting (she has an anxiety disorder and cptsd) or if I\u2019m in the wrong.

You better be kissing your girlfriend's ass from here on out, get your shitty parents to meaningfully apologize to her in person, and either tell them they are moving out \"X\" number of days sooner than agreed upon because they showed up early or grow some cojones and give them the boot now.", "YTA. I can\u2019t even tell you how much YTA. Apologize like crazy to your GF and get your parents a room at an extended stay hotel.

If you truly loved her you wouldn't have allowed any of that to happen (ignoring her conditions) and would stop using the \"I didn't know what to do!\" excuse because the hard truth is that you just think your gf is being dramatic and are ignorant to the fact your mom only apologized to look good to get her way and not because she actually meant it.", "YTA this is a good thing soon you\u2019re GF will be single (by your own fault) and she can find someone who cares about her more than her shitty BF and even worse mother.", "YTA she should dump you.", "YTA and I hope she dumps you.

Yes, you're forcing her, because you've done NOTHING to make the situation at all tenable.  Not to mention that she has anxiety disorders.  I know you'll protest, and say you love her.  I'm sure you do.  But you clearly value her very, very little.  She is at the bottom of the stack of priorities, likely because she is quiet, and introverted.

You trapped the poor girl in her room. I rally against the word abuse, but you are abusing that girl and heaping more trauma on top of it. She\u2019s a prisoner paying the bills.", "YTA your parents treated her like crap she had boundaries yall broke then and your moms apology is fake af. You DID make your gf an outsider in her own home.", "YTA. Your gf is right you may not make it through this. You should not have allowed them to move in. AND your mom is going to get exactly what she wanted and that is to break you two up. You fell for it and you have no one but yourself to blame.", "yikes looks like there will be 3 people soon with nowhere to stay.\n\nYTA.", "You're a fuxking selfish asshole..I hope she leaves you and never comes back.", "YTA. She put up very simple boundaries that your parents then purposefully stomped all over.  I have no doubts they *purposefully* left early so they would manipulate you into letting them stay. The fact you\u2019re also using excuses to justify tolerating this situation and allowing it to continue 14 days longer than necessary is also very manipulative and an AH move on your part.\n\nYou have shown very clearly you have no respect for your girlfriend\u2019s feelings. She deserves someone much better.\n\nAnd the worst of all\u2026it\u2019s *her* house, not yours!\n\nYou need to do some serious self-reflection and I would seriously look into counselling as given all the particulars of the situation I can\u2019t see this relationship surviving.", "Let me get this straight. You have work. You have your parents. You have out of town friends. You have a thousand excuses but you don\u2019t have your girlfriend\u2019s back?! Seriously?! You are living in her home, yanno, the one she is currently exiled to only a shared bedroom because you can\u2019t be bothered to support her and do what you promised. \n\nAnd you think it\u2019s her diagnoses that are causing her to tell you that your relationship might not survive? Do you make it a habit to break your promises to her then tell her that it\u2019s her anxiety? \n\nYTA. Have a discussion with your awful parents and support your girlfriend that has so generously allowed your awful parents to move in during their time of need.", "YTA\n\nAlso, love how you tuck in her having anxiety and CPTSD at the end to justify thinking she's overreacting when it actually makes you look worse. The whole situation was bad enough as is--your mom hated your girlfriend for being introverted, bullied your gf, and then you forced your girlfriend to accept your parents in her home without her reasonable boundaries being expected. \n\nBut gods! She has long-term trauma, and you're forcing her to share a space she should feel safe in with someone who has hurt her severely, and you didn't even let her do it on her own terms. I don't blame her for staying in her room, but I am genuinely worried for her mental state right now. I hope she's using this time to realize how much better she'll be without you", "YTA.  Your parents have a long history of ignoring her and not making her feel welcomed. You REALLY think a half slapped text is appropriate?", "YTA. I hope this post made it to tiktok or anywhere and your gf found this post, read the comments and leave u. I feel so bad for her.", "You don't know if your in the wrong? It's been weeks and you didn't bring up this conversation yet? Do you even have a spine. You arr WRONG. She isn't overreacting. Yoi suck as a partner. She can do better. Mommys boys like you are always worthless partners in the end. YTA", "YTA \n\nGF owns the house!!! The parents need a place to stay and all of a sudden they are willing to apologize after years of abuse towards GF. I hope his GF finds this post. She has been stuck in her bedroom day and night cause she is no longer comfortable in HER OWN HOME!!!", "YTA for so many reasons it\u2019s hard to even comprehend, and you also should marry your mommy instead, she\u2019s clearly the only woman you care about.", "YTA i hope she dump you and kick all 3 of you out. Please update this when it happen OP, praying for the good update \ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude07\ud83d\ude07", "YTA", "YTA. Your girlfriend has no obligation to let your family live in her living space. 0, especially when your family\u2019s quite mean to her. A text 5 days prior does not make things right, and an apology doesn\u2019t fix shit (an apology TEXT? Really?) dude put yourself in your girlfriend\u2019s shoes for a second and you wouldn\u2019t have needed to type this very long post on Reddit", "INFO: what's the plan, how long are they staying? Is there an end date for their stay? \n\nYTA but I'm just curious how much of an ass... \n\nYou are disrespecting your girlfriend every day that goes by and you don't address her conditions. \n\nWhy exactly are you putting this off? Do you know what to say? Are you afraid of displeasing your parents? Why can't you see that you're catering to your parents (who've gotten THEMSELVES into this mess) to the detriment of your relationship? Is just sweeping bad behavior under the rug a normal thing in your family? \n\nDo you want to be alone? Because your gf deserves better than this, and it's just a matter of time before she'll be done with this relationship. Your actions are showing her that she is not a priority, sweeping your parent bad behaviour under the rug is.\n\nSit down with parents:\n\n1. Let them know that they need to apologize for their abhorrent behavior and that you'll be watching like a hawk for any disrespect to her. Remind them they are GUESTS in HER HOME. Maybe they should stay in their room in the evening so she can have use of her own space.\n\n2. Set an END DATE. You've allowed financially irresponsible ppl with atrocious behavior set YALLS HOUSE as their mailing address.  Sir, you are dumb. Let them know they have X weeks/months to stay, but this is NOT permanent.\n\nAnd any WHIFF of disrespect to your wife and out they go.\n\nCome on now, you can do this. Show your partner who comes first. Show her the kind of partner you can be. Grow a spine and cut the apron strings.", "YTA\n\nSorry but it\u2019s your gfs home too and you completely ignored the fact she has a say on who stays in her own home. \n\nFix this now OP or you may have ruined the relationship forever.", "OP, YTA big time. Your girlfriend\u2019s concerns are so valid and you\u2019re making excuses for your parents poor behavior. Not one of you remembered to cover your girlfriend\u2019s concerns at dinner, oh how convenient! I also just read that this is your girlfriend\u2019s home. I hope she finds this post, kicks all of you out and lives her best life.", "YTA. One no from one person is all it should take for it to be a no. You dont owe anyone space in your home and she should have the right to not have to live with other people in her own home. Bringing in other roommates significantly increase your expenses, food budget, cleaning routine and household purchases and utility bills. She problem feels overwhelmed dealing with your parents knowing they hate her, and now they are mooching off her.\n\nYou are most definitely the AH with her mental health diagnoses. This poor girl doesn't even feel comfortable in her own home now due to the toxic and abusive way they've mistreated her in the past. Having anxiety and CPTSD makes it so much worse.\n\nIf you did this to me, I'd have kicked you all out the night they showed up. You don't move your family who has demonstrated they Hate your GF into her own house! Buy your own place for them to live in and mooch off you!\n\nWow. No one falls in love faster then someone who needs a place to stay.", "YTA  she agreed on 2 conditions. You did not meet those conditions. You trampled her boundaries.", "YTA & so are your parents\u2026.1st what is the big deal (this isn\u2019t the 1st time this comes up on here) with someone bringing potluck?? We love that!!\n2nd, know how your parents have treated her, why would you be ok with them staying with you? They do not respect your gf therefore they shouldn\u2019t be in her home.", "Your girlfriend is right.\n\nYou don't care about her boundaries, and you forced her in a position where she needs to suck it up or be a villain.\n\nShe was willing to compromise and she told you how this will work, but you ignored it. If you care about her, you wouldn't spend the evening catching up with your parents, but you would address the pressing issue.\n\nEdit: Woah! Just now I've read that it's her house! I hope she kicks you and your freeloading parents out. \n\nYTA", "YTA. You allowed yourself to be manipulated by your parents and aren\u2019t doing anything about it. You may not have a GF much longer.", "YTA. You moved your parents into your girlfriend's home while doing everything possible to ignore her boundaries and needs. She's now trapped in her bedroom and you're offering insincere apologies. You'll be incredibly lucky if she doesn't sell the house to escape you.", "YTA.....There is no way I'd stay in a house with people that treated me like these parents treated OOP'S GF, much less stay with them AND the spineless BF! Yeah, his disregard for her needs and her boundaries is just disgusting. She should walk out!", "You know your parents lied to you, there NEVER WAS any friend they were going to stay with for the 1st week.  They just said that to buy some extra time and then just show up at your doorstep with no other place to go.  Your parents knew you would not turn them away and you would throw your girlfriend's feelings and boundaries in the trash for them.  Your girlfriend is correct, your relationship IS NOT going to survive this.  You broke her trust and destroyed all respect she had for you.  You better start figuring out a place for you and your parents to move to because you are going to become unwelcome in your girlfriend's home very soon.  YTA", "YTA. your gf cared enough about you to allow your parent who dislike her and tried to break you up move in with you. But neither you or your parents respected the requests she had.\n\nYour parents decided to turn up early, you decided catching up was more important than addressing the issues your gf wanted addressed. Friends visiting from out of town have been more important to you than your GF being made an outsider in her own home \n\nA quick text is not a proper apology, that was if i do this i dont need to follow the rules when i get there. Since they were turning up early.\n\nSTOP playing down your GFs anxieties regarding your parents and the future of your relationship. If she is saying you might not make it through this you better decide how to fix things", "Lol! Do not waste anymore of your girlfriend\u2019s time and money. You do not love her at all. You are despicable. You parents are despicable. You didn\u2019t make time to talk with them because, it was never your priority. You are as manipulative as your parents.", "YTA\n\nI am actually disgusted. She deserves so much better.\n\nYou say you love her, but your actions say otherwise.", "Op, your comments just make you sound worse, stop with the excuses already. You completely trampled your girlfriends boundaries. \n\nSuck it up and do the right thing and have the hard conversion with your parents. If you are *too afraid* to do that you are not ready to live with someone let alone get married. YTA", "Nah. He needs to get out and take mommy dearest and useless daddy with him. It is HER house. She is the owner. Only her.", "She used to be a sugar baby. She told me early on before we got serious.", "Wow! If evict the whole lot of them if my boyfriend ever tried pulling that crap with me! Not even his house and he's moving people in like he owns the place. Do better op and get your parents a hotel!", "You do not love her, you do not respect her or her boundaries. You do not care how she feels. All you do is make excuses for all the shit behaviour you and your parents have exhibited. I would have put them out and kept them to the promise my gf asked for. She has been nothing short of generous to you and your parents.\n\nI do not want to be mean, but you using her mental health has me really wanting to go off on you as well. It is far from right. It is disgusting and frankly, you are using her mental health to your and your parents advantage. They get to stay, you don't get to talk about the issues at hand and she, well, she remains isolated. And we all know how isolation and abuse come together", "anyone could have seen that scheme a mile away", "Your parents are grown ass adults they can figure it out. Your gf lives there and now her safe space isn't safe.", "You\u2019re about to become homeless along with your parents, well at least that\u2019s what the three of you deserve", "**Your parents** agreed to (a) talk about the past issue, and (b) stay elsewhere while everyone acclimated. **Your parents** then *supposedly* left early without asking their hosts if they could accommodate. **You** notably saw nothing wrong with them coming early without verifying with their host, **you** didn't see anything wrong with your parents coming straight to your house immediately upon getting to town, and **you** failed to facilitate the conversation that you agreed to participate in... and you are supposedly surprised and annoyed that your partner is shutting herself in her room??\n\nOf course YTA.", "Omg you are the slimiest of weasel for that.", "YTA and full of bullshit.   \n\n\nYou don't respect nor love your gf because if you love your gf, you wouldn't do this crap to her, knowingly. I pity your gf and I hope she puts the house for sale and leave you to your deadbeat parents.", "Wait you moved them into her home but never discussed finances with your parents and still haven\u2019t? So your gf is paying for the people that have been abusing her your entire relationship. Oh and Mommy\u2019s text means nothing. She had no problem opening her mouth to insult and belittle your gf, she shouldn\u2019t have a problem opening to apologize for someone who is keeping her from living on the streets!", "I hope she kicks all 3 of you out and knows her worth. This is gross", "lmfaooo so they are getting kicked out soon...", "Time to go find an apartment for you and your parents.", "Take your parents and get out of HER house. Get out. You don\u2019t deserve to be there. YTA", "Agreed! Said the same in my own comment!", "So mom insults her about her past way of receiving income, tries to get you to break up then has to live in HER house because she is unable to financially support herself? Wow YTA and you come from AHs.", "I figured it was probably sex work of some kind. Honestly this makes the whole situation worse. Sex work is apparently worthy of contempt, but now they want to stay in the house she bought from the money she earned from doing that work? That's rich. Grow a spine and defend your wife.", "Seriously. Someone find this girl's username and let's get her in here. She needs to kick them out ASAP.", "Run? From her own house? Naw, toss out the bf and his rotten parents... burn some sage... and move on with your life! Find someone with a spine, that knows the definition of respect!", "You made my own thoughts real. Enjoy that award in place of an emphatic and not creepy hug.", "Wait, so she can pUt them all out of her house? Op's girl, pls see this post, send them ***ALL*** PACKING!!!", "I doubt I\u2019m on the deed, she did all the paperwork and stuff and I didn\u2019t even know you could be on the deed without being on the mortgage. Thanks for the info.", "lolol she can't leave but you and your baggage will be", "This. I hope letting yourself be a doormat was with loosing your house and gf.", "Wonderful. I was honestly hoping this was the case.", "She MIGHT be able to, depending on who is on the deed to the house. If the deed was put in both names, gf and bf, then no, she can't, as bf owns the house alongside gf.\n\nAs it is, we KNOW that gf is 100% liable for the debt (ie, mortgage) regardless.", "If your gf did all the paperwork, and she was smart knowing she was the only person on the mortgage, then she likely didn't put you on the deed. Which would mean it's 100% her house, and, as such, would have every right to kick you and your parents out.\n\nIf she WASN'T smart when she did the paperwork, and added you to the deed, well... that's on her.\n\nIf you don't KNOW if you're on the deed or not? I'd GUESS you're not. \n\nSo yeah... while it's not totally confirmed, it's more than likely her house.", "And either way, you know that you\u2019re wrong. You\u2019ve treated her poorly and THAT ISN\u2019T YOUR HOUSE! You should be ashamed of yourself.", "Oh ok.", "I posted this in another comment to highlight the point.\n\nWhen I divorced my wife, I gave her the house. She never got the deed taken out of my name. The mortgage had already been paid off. She passed 5 years after the divorce and gave the house to her daughter in her will. The deed, however, was still in my name. Her daughter had to get a lawyer to do a Quit Claim that I signed, turning the house over to her (which, I had to badger her to do). Without that Quit Claim, the deed was still in my name, and thus, was still my house/property.", "Oh, ok. Thanks for the info.", "And, just fyi, OP responded. It LOOKS like he's not on the deed. Not confirmed, though. But yeah, it APPEARS as if gf owns the house 100%."]}
