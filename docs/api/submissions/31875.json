She had everything boxed and ready to go so I grabbed and left. Now the issue, the grocery store was running a promotion that if you spend so much that you get a free turkey. I spent well over and was missing the turkey. This wasn't for the family get together, but was planning it for my families thanksgiving. I call her and asked her about it. Her response was that since she bought the groceries it was her turkey. I paid for them so felt it was my turkey. Went back and forth and decided it wasn't worth the fight so I let it go. \n\nThe big family get together went fine, but she kept making snide remarks about the stupid turkey and I ignored her. We ended up having another family event on Saturday and again she kept making snide remarks about my \"entitlement\" towards the turkey.
