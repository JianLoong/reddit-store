It is never fun and I understand the pain.\nI went NC with my middle school/high school bsf. She was so racist. Her entire family was. Her and her mother on multiple occasions called me and my family \"one of the good ones\" in reference to us being Latinos. Literally the only thing that made me good was that I was born a citizen. Not to mention that she was homophobic as well. You don't need that shit. Let racists go. You shouldn't stay because of expectations. She isn't a real friend or ally if she's dating the racist and excusing his behavior.

If she's been around casual racism her whole life, and never been the target of it herself, she may not realize how much it impacts you. It's important to call these things out, and shine a light in those dark places. Tell her exactly how and why it hurt, and go from there if you want to stay friends with her or not.\n\nHonestly, as a white woman from a very monotone area, I'm ashamed to say that while I understood intellectually, and never considered myself racist, it took living in Thailand and experiencing it personally to really start to understand on a visceral level what POC go through, and how much the casual shit SUCKS and wears you down like water torture. Drip. Drip. Drip. Fuck!\n\nYou don't have to put up with that energy in your life. But I think it's important to call it out and tell her why. That's how we learn. I definitely cringe when I think of some of the things I've said in the past, and I'm grateful to the people who took the time to check me on that shit.
