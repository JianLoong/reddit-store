One of my best friend's (F17) boyfriend (M19) have on two occasions said that I eat cats and dogs. Ive told my best friend (who is white) on multiple occasions the racism i've faced and how it affected me. The first time her bf was racist to me, she took it a little more seriously, but ended up brushing it under the rug when he gave the excuse that's how his friends joke (he doesn't even have asian friends). The second time happened yesterday and she didn't even try to excuse his actions & I could tell she was making a joke out of it. The only thing besides that was an \"i'm sorry \ud83d\ude14\" message, but that was right after she made a joke of it and knowing her this wasn't a serious message. This whole thing is kind of rubbing me the wrong way, so I want to distance myself from her for a while. But i'm worried I might be overreacting, she's not taking it seriously and it's making me feel like i'm victimizing myself. I feel like I shouldn't have to take this from one of my best friends after years of racism, but I guess technically it's her bf doing the stereotyping.

That's plenty of reason to distance yourself.   \nPrioritize spending time with people who make you feel welcome and cared for and who don't engage in or support racist behavior. If your current bestie even bothers to notice and ask, then you can have a conversation with her about how she ignored your boundaries, made you feel, and that a lame apology text while engaging in racist behavior doesn't count as an apology nor is it being a good friend.

Plenty of kids get that stuff from their friends or family, and don't realize the impact especially if they grow up in pretty mono-color cultures.    I knew many people at college who were grew up in small towns and were very quickly educated about how not to be racist by not making jokes with racist elements.   They weren't bad people or filled with entrenched, immovable racism, they just thought the jokes were funny and needed to understand why they weren't.", "You tell them that their behavior is bad, explain them why and show them the consequences of their action. \n\nI think this would work great.

It is also changed by the march of living generations.   Each generation affects the living generations below, and above it.   Many grandparents out there have been educated out of their inherited bigotry by being exposed to same-sex couples, interracial couples, etc, often right in their own family.\n\nAnd many old people are incapable of changing their beliefs, but not all old people.  Many old people just held on to their beliefs because they were never challenged their whole life -   so sometimes try challenging them before writing them off."]}
