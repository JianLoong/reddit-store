One rule for all guests, family or no, is you can not sleep with your partner if you aren't married, no exceptions. I've always thought that was very fair, their house their rules, and me and my wife (27F) followed it happily whenever we visted (which is frequently, the whole family lives really close together) for five years till we got married last year. \n\nThe issue is my sister (29F) and her \"fiance\" (28M). I say it like that because they've been \"engaged\" for four years, together for eight. They claim they did this to save money, even though my parents offered to pay for the wedding four years ago (they won't now though), and they turned them down, wanting to take it slow.\n\nThe whole extended family was planning to come over my parents place for a get together for a few day's next week, and my sister asked our parents, with me in the room, if they could share a bed (usually she get's her old room, he shares the basement with our uncles). Before my parents said anything I reminded her that she knew very well the rule, and my parents agreed. My sister said \"Ok great we'll get a room at the hotel up the road\" Me and my parents are floored, we all think this is very disrespectful to the people who birthed and raised her, and not staying home is showing she values casual sex more than our parents. I told her she was a disloyal, ane frankly bad daughter, now she isn't coming and hasn't spoken to any family since.

Good for your sister for having healthy boundaries.  She asked and responded in a mature way.

It was respectful for her and her fiance to get a room for themselves at a hotel nearby instead of just not coming to the gathering. \n\nYour sister and her fiance are adults who have committed to marry each other, want an expensive wedding, but do not believe that it is necessary to have a wedding in order to validate their commitment to each other. \n\nIt is disrespectful for your parents to impose their beliefs and rules on their adult child, and off-the-charts disrespectful for you to tell her she's a bad daughter. Make efforts to repair your relationship with your sister now before she chooses to go no-contact with you. Siblings go no-contact for far less.

Don't throw stones at glass houses.", "YTA getting a hotel room doesn't mean valuing \"casual sex\"\n\nI come from a traditional family and stayed at a hotel with my fiance while visiting them for a weekend. They were cool with it. There wasn't any space for the both of us to stay at my parents house anyway. If my sibling reacted the same way you did, I would sure as hell have the same reaction and not speak to you.", "YTA, if for nothing else calling your sister and her partners intimacy \u2018casual sex\u2019. That\u2019s extremely demeaning, probably misogynistic.", "YTA. And also a mommy's boy?  You don't need to parrot your mommy and daddy's rules self-righteously.\n\nAnyway, as you said their house their rules... so they decided not to stay in the house.\n\nSeems like you're the one who's not respecting your sister.", "YTA, no question. Who do you think you are, judging her like that? Sounds to me you are jealous that you didn't think of simply getting a hotel before you got married.", "Yes, you are the a-hole.  First, it's your parents' house and rules.  You stepping in sounds like you are trying to usurp their role as parents.  My opinion is validated by your own words when you say to her that she \" . . . was disloyal, and frankly a bad daughter.\"  She is NOT your daughter.  She is your sister.  \n\nSecondly, if your sister, at twenty-nine years old, wants to honor your parents' house rules, then staying at a hotel does that.  \n\nAnd thirdly, if your sister was nineteen, I might have sympathy for you and your parents' viewpoint, but she is twenty-nine years old.  What happens if she and her partner never get married.  Will you have this same view if they are in their thirties with kids?\n\nThis is a clear case of someone taking their own moral code and forcing it onto someone else in ways that negate the whole reason for having said moral code in the first place.  You now have made your sister and her fianc\u00e9 feel so judged and unwelcome that it won't really matter than they aren't following \"tradition\" because you've effectively pushed them out of your lives.\n\nIf your moral tenets are wrapped up in your religion, I would recommend thinking about some of what your religion says about judging and persecuting others.", "YTA. your sister has been with the same partner for nearly 10 years, and you and your parents are still nitpicking about outdated traditional values. Sister was right to get her own hotel room!", "YTA.\n\nWho asked you?  They are adults and can make their own decisions.", "Ofc YTA are you fkn DELUSIONAL lmao", "YTA. This is quite literally none of your business. \n\nAnd sleeping in the same bed with your partner is about much more than \u201ccasual sex\u201d.  It\u2019s about sweetness, closeness, and emotional intimacy. It\u2019s sad that you can\u2019t understand that, I feel bad for your partner.", "YTA. Hardly casual if she's been in a monogamous relationship for 8 years. I've been engaged for almost 25 years and not arranged the marriage. Why not? A deposit on house more important and being honest the palaver and drama of relations  demanding and expecting is a right put off. What type of wedding are your really traditional family expecting? In case of children, marriage makes sense but otherwise power of attorney for medical emergencies suffices. \n\nA hotel seems a perfectly reasonable compromise. Your parents are not condoning sin under their roof, your sister gets to share her bed with her partner as with every other night in their life but they still get to see the family. Stop being the morality police. You've just shown her that policing her behaviour and saving face more important than a relationship with her.", "YTA\n\nYou're right, it's your parents' house and their rules. Your sister and her fiance don't like the rules, so they aren't staying in your parents' house. There's no problem here, except y'all being a bunch of judgemental busybodies.", "YTA. \n\nWhy are you and your parents so obsessed with your sisters sex life. It\u2019s weird and creepy. \n\nAlso, she is following the \u201chouse rules\u201d by doing as she suggests. She\u2019s not allowed to share a bed under their roof - ace, she won\u2019t stay under their roof \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffd everyone wins.", "YTA \"she values casual sex\" Uhhh, they're engaged. They've been together for several years. How is that casual sex?! I assume this is just you being blinded by those so-called \"traditional values\" and you're implying that it's always casual/immoral if one is not married.\n\nEither way, of course you're the asshole. Your sister followed your parents' rules, and she and her fiance simply decided they'd stay elsewhere. Perfectly reasonable. You and your parents need to get over yourselves.", "Sharing a bed with your partner of 8 years is not \u201ccasual sex.\u201d  They may not have a piece of paper, but they are clearly in a committed relationship.

She asked your parents. You don\u2019t get to speak for them. \n\n2. She\u2019s following the rules of the house. She\u2019s just not following them the way you want.\n\n3. You aren\u2019t angry because she\u2019s being disrespectful. You\u2019re angry because she isn\u2019t doing what you want.\n\nYou mention in the comments you couldn\u2019t even sleep on the same floor as your sister when extended family visited because they thought you and your sister would be sexual with each other. You may think you\u2019re reasonable because you don\u2019t believe *that* but you\u2019ve internalized far more of the toxicity of your family than you think.", "Sleeping together(sex or no sex)in an 8-year relationship isn't casual sex dude. This is 2023. Upgrade your views.", "yta.  It's been 8 years.  It's not casual sex.  They won't take you parents money for a good reason.  They don't want them to have control over them.", "YTA.\n\nHard YTA. \n\nLook. I'm pretty traditional myself. \n\nBut it's not up to me to force my family to follow my values regarding sex. \n\nAnd it's not really casual sex, either. Your sister is in a comitted relationship. Casual sex indicates there is NOT a comitted relationship. \n\nYour sister is not being disloyal or a bad daughter. \n\nYour sister is choosing to love her family while also adhering to her own personal values. They just happen to be different from those of you and your parents on this issue. \n\nIf she were badmouthing your family and whining that she'd been mistreated when she hadn't, or was abusive or something towards you or your parents, or whatever, then yeah, you'd have a case for what you said. \n\nBut she was doing nothing truly wrong. She wasn't being hateful. She just wants to share a bed with the man she's been with for *eight years.* And there's nothing wrong with that. \n\nAnd quite honestly, I don't blame them for not accepting help from your parents on the wedding, either. Because it sounds like your parents would have tried to control that and make it super traditional and according to their tastes, and not what your sister and her fiance want.", "YTA - who in the hell do you think you are?", "What year are you guys living in?

Why on Earth would he want to do that?", "YTA. \n\nYes, if she were staying at your parents\u2019 home, she would follow their rules. Because your parents\u2019 rules are antiquated, your sister and her fianc\u00e9 decided not to stay with them. This shows that your sister respects their rules.

Your sister was talking to your parents and it's their home, not yours. \n\nSecond of all, not wanting to be subjected to rules she does not believe in does not make her a bad person or a bad daughter. It makes her a bad pawn in whatever fantasy world your parents and you live in where a grown woman needs to be controlled by her parents. \n\nThird, she did not try to break her parents' rules.

Heck, personally, if I were by myself I wouldn't want to live in that kind of mayhem and I'd default to a hotel.

One rule for all guests, family or no, is you can not sleep with your partner if you aren't married, no exceptions. I've always thought that was very fair, their house their rules, and me and my wife (27F) followed it happily whenever we visted (which is frequently, the whole family lives really close together) for five years till we got married last year. \n\nThe issue is my sister (29F) and her \"fiance\" (28M). I say it like that because they've been \"engaged\" for four years, together for eight. They claim they did this to save money, even though my parents offered to pay for the wedding four years ago (they won't now though), and they turned them down, wanting to take it slow.\n\nThe whole extended family was planning to come over my parents place for a get together for a few day's next week, and my sister asked our parents, with me in the room, if they could share a bed (usually she get's her old room, he shares the basement with our uncles). Before my parents said anything I reminded her that she knew very well the rule, and my parents agreed. My sister said \"Ok great we'll get a room at the hotel up the road\" Me and my parents are floored, we all think this is very disrespectful to the people who birthed and raised her, and not staying home is showing she values casual sex more than our parents. I told her she was a disloyal, ane frankly bad daughter, now she isn't coming and hasn't spoken to any family since. My wife mostly agrees but thinks I went too far.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I wouldn't want that for anyone, either.\n\nETA: I'm thinking maybe the parents just made up the rule for OP because of his lack of control. He interrupted before they had a chance to speak.
