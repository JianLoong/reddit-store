We currently live in a condo that he owns so I pay him rent. My bf's sister (26F) recently moved in with us about four months ago because she got a job in our city. She pays him rent as well less than the market rate because she's family.\n\nShe's a nurse and she works day shifts about 3 days a week. My bf and I both work full time on a hybrid schedule. When she first moved in, I've been the one cooking our meals. I didn't mind at first because I'm the one that cooks for my bf and I, and we split up the chores evenly so that my bf is in charge of other things like laundry. I understand that moving to a new city and starting a new job is stressful, so my bf asked if we could help his sister out by cooking for her so that she doesn't have to worry about her meals and can focus on doing well at work. \n\nIt's been four months now and I'm still preparing our meals (except breakfast, which we don't really eat anyway). Everyday my bf's sister asks me what can she expect for dinner, what time will dinner be ready, what food is she bringing for lunch tomorrow, makes requests when she doesn\u2019t like our food, etc. \n\nI told my bf I think we can start having her prepare her meals, at least the meals that she brings to work since that is her responsibility. So we brought this up one day, but she begrudgingly agreed and countered that she needs all her free time to rest/recharge because her job is already so demanding and tiring. I told her that I'll still continue to cook but she can at least start to be responsible for her meals for work since she doesn't contribute to our shared meals. Then she got upset and said that we don't understand how stressful her job is and that we're making it worse for her, and if I'm already cooking anyway why make her cook her own meals.\n\nHonestly I am tired of arguing, but I also don't want to cause a rift in the family because now she is complaining to their parents. Truly I understand that being a nurse is tough, but I don't see how she doesn't have any time at all to prepare her own meals.

If I don\u2019t like what someone else has made, I either eat it bc it is polite/ free food or I make my own food", "Which means it is time for her to take care of her food needs. NTA.", "Sorry, I am a retired nurse and I would have hated to work with someone like her. Just make the meals you would have normally made when she wasn't there and tell her to suck it up buttercup.\n\nNTA", "She's full of crap. I was working full time 12 hour nursing shifts in my mid-thirties while doing ALL the meal planning, shopping, cooking and cleaning. Does this woman plan on living with y'all forever? Sounds like it's time to discuss her moving out.\n\nYou're NTA.", "NTA- what will she do when she moves out? Though with how easy she has it, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if she stayed forever!
