We currently live in a condo that he owns so I pay him rent. My bf's sister (26F) recently moved in with us about four months ago because she got a job in our city. She pays him rent as well less than the market rate because she's family.\n\nShe's a nurse and she works day shifts about 3 days a week. My bf and I both work full time on a hybrid schedule. When she first moved in, I've been the one cooking our meals. I didn't mind at first because I'm the one that cooks for my bf and I, and we split up the chores evenly so that my bf is in charge of other things like laundry. I understand that moving to a new city and starting a new job is stressful, so my bf asked if we could help his sister out by cooking for her so that she doesn't have to worry about her meals and can focus on doing well at work. \n\nIt's been four months now and I'm still preparing our meals (except breakfast, which we don't really eat anyway). Everyday my bf's sister asks me what can she expect for dinner, what time will dinner be ready, what food is she bringing for lunch tomorrow, makes requests when she doesn\u2019t like our food, etc. \n\nI told my bf I think we can start having her prepare her meals, at least the meals that she brings to work since that is her responsibility. So we brought this up one day, but she begrudgingly agreed and countered that she needs all her free time to rest/recharge because her job is already so demanding and tiring. I told her that I'll still continue to cook but she can at least start to be responsible for her meals for work since she doesn't contribute to our shared meals. Then she got upset and said that we don't understand how stressful her job is and that we're making it worse for her, and if I'm already cooking anyway why make her cook her own meals.\n\nHonestly I am tired of arguing, but I also don't want to cause a rift in the family because now she is complaining to their parents. Truly I understand that being a nurse is tough, but I don't see how she doesn't have any time at all to prepare her own meals.

If she isn\u2019t cooking 1/3 of the house meals, she should be contributing some other way.", "NTA. I know a lot of nurses who work three days a week. Yes, it's a stressful occupation, but it doesn't preclude them from feeding themselves. You're being taken advantage of.", "NTA. She sounds entitled af. \n\nIt doesn't even matter if she's financially contributing to household food for dinners...you are not her servant.\n\nYou were very gracious when she first moved in but that was months ago. Time for her to move!\n\nBTW, my husband is an RN.  He's the one who cooks in our house (because he loves it and it's a stress reducer for him AND I never expect him to, he does it when he wants to).  She can do it, she just doesn't want to.", "NTA , she\u2019s using you , she works 3 days for the week and is off for 4 she has enough time to rest and recover from her days on. You should stop making the food for her and force her to figure it out because that\u2019s the only way she\u2019s going to do something when she has no choice ! Tough love is needed here !!", "NTA. It\u2019s time for her to grow tf up. She\u2019s 26, not 6. She can take care of herself, she\u2019s just choosing not to. Stop doing for her what she can do for herself. It\u2019s weird to me that your husband even made this insistence on you, but be firm in your boundaries and stick to them. It sounds like those two will take advantage of you if you continue to let them. ETA: she also sounds ungrateful and not appreciate of what you are doing for her, so just stop. Stop being her personal chef and let her be a grown up.", "NTA - there\u2019s helping her out and then there\u2019s coddling. Your BFs sister is an adult and needs to start behaving like one", "NTA, she is capable of meal planning for her lunches.  She's got four days to sort that out, after all.", "What?! 3 days a week? How is that fair? Please let her know that her options are taking a full share of the housework or 100% of the chores at her own place.\n\nYou're not her mom. Big bro isn't her dad.\n\nNTA. Except maybe to yourself. If boyfriend doesn't back you up, baby can move home if the reality of daily life is too difficult.", "Ya so she chose her career. You all work full time. I hope she's also paying for food. No kne should expect someone to mom them.  She may have a tough job but she's lazy and entitled.  \n\nNTA. And if your bf tells you at some point to keep waiting on her,  you've got a bigger problem.", "INFO: are you and the sister paying the same amount of rent? Do you get any space in the apartment for yourself?\n\nWhat I mean is, you're paying for a room you share with your boyfriend. She's paying for her own room and meal service. Is she also getting maid services? Laundry service?\n\nHow long are you expecting to subsidize her lifestyle? How long is she planning on living with you guys?", "NTA - If she were working daily I would *maybe* think differently but I don't understand how she can't possibly cook food the other 4 days of the week? Or at the very least throw in money towards monthly groceries. \n\nI can understand cooking enough for her to eat a meal when she gets off of work, but why should you still be cooking her lunch and dinner of her off days? She's only a year younger than you, it's not like she's 15.", "NTA. If she doesn't learn how to plan now, she never will. You aren't responsible for another adult's meals.", "NTA.  You need to just stop cooking for her or make things she doesn't like. Maybe she needs to move out; someone moving into an established household sounds stressful.", "NTA but she sounds very entitled. I would suggest setting clear boundaries and splitting up the household chores in a way that is fair so you don't end up doing it all.", "NTA. Three days a week leaves plenty of time to plan out her own lunch at the very least. Sounds like sis is a freeloader. Get up off the floor and stop letting her walk all over you.", "NTA you are not her mother and she has no right to expect a free service like this.

Just curious.", "NTA, but also, do *you* pay market rate? As in, does she pay less than you do?", "NTA: She's a big girl and can make her own lunches for work. It doesn't take much effort to do that. Most people make their own meals. It's really nice that you offer to cook dinner for everyone, which you don't have to do. It's more than a fair compromise to have her make her own meals for lunches while you offer to make dinner. It wouldn't be unreasonable for you to expect her to help out with dinner on occasion, especially if she only works 3 days a week. That's less than HALF the week. Why should you be expected to cook when you work full time and she only works part time? That isn't fair to you. (I'm assuming you work full time...sorry if I'm mistaken)", "NTA. She has absolutely no grounds for expecting you to take care of her lunches at work. Sure her job is stressful, but it's her job and she's an adult. You're not her mother. \n\nAs for the dinners, is she paying at least for ingredients and maybe your time? She's treating you like her servant. She is not entitled to your cooking and her stress level is irrelevant. If you want to continue to invite her to participate in dinners you make, you should at least stop catering to her. She can share some of what you're already making or cook for herself.", "Info is his sister paying less than you? You said she pays less because she is family? What are you then? Chopped liver?", "NTA she got used to your kindness and appears to be quite ungrateful. I get her job is tough, but that does not absolve her from responsibility. And to complain to her parents because you won't make her food is ridiculous.", "NTA. Her level of entitlement is off the chain. Just stop accommodating her. Also, where is your bf in all this? He should be backing you up because it\u2019s unreasonable.", "NTA. Be prepared for her to be staying for the long haul. If she\u2019s too stressed to cook her own meals, she won\u2019t be moving out anytime soon.", "NTA\nMy MIL is a nurse. She works 3-4, 12 hour shifts a week. She manages to cook and keep a whole house clean while going back to school to become a nurse practitioner. And also baking amazing cakes for all birthdays/events. Her job is hard but so are many others. As long as she has you acting like her mom, she will stay a teenager.", "MORE INFO: Are you gaining any equity in this condo?", "NTA, if she only works three days per week, like many nurses, she can do food prep on the other days.

She has four non-work days per week, unless she chooses to pick up call. \n\nIt\u2019s really not that bad, and don\u2019t let anyone tell you that it is.

What are your complains aside from sister bugging you(which you can talk to her to stop), is it harder to cook for 3? does it take longer? are you the one paying for all the food?\n\nBeing a nurse is a very unforgiving and hard job", "Exactly!\n\nThe chores were split 2-ways between OP and her BF. Now that there is a third adult in the household, the duties should be renegotiated accordingly.", "And why is just OP cooking? What about the bf? It is his sister? They both work the same amount! OP isn't their maid!", "Yep. I worked 12 hour shifts for years. You usually have one day to recover, but the other days you get your stuff done.

I pay less than her because technically I have a shared room and bathroom with my bf. I think I'm paying less than market rate too, but I'm not sure and that's on me.", "No I am not, my bf fully owns it so I don't have equity in this condo.", "OP and her BF had split the house chores (presumably equitably), and she ended up with the cooking. Now that 3 people leave in their home, it is only fair the chores to be split 3-ways.\n\nI imagine if the sister choses to relieve OP from other chores, OP will be glad to continue cooking for the three of them.

I hear you, being a nurse takes a lot out of you, that's why I'm torn and thinking I might be the AH.", "OP and her boyfriend rearranged their chores (he does their laundry now) so she is 100% food.", "Wow. So she knows enough to say thank you but not enough to actually be thankful for your work.\n\nIf she's got enough energy to complain, she's got enough energy to contribute.", "That\u2019s not a genuine thanks. Unfortunately. She sounds like a user. I\u2019m staying with family right now and when they cook I eat it and say thank you and offer to clean up. My thanks is genuine, there are no complaints and I certainly wouldn\u2019t have the audacity to argue with someone who is kind enough to cook enough food for me to eat. Your SIL is not thankful. She is not grateful. I hope you can understand this through her actions because I don\u2019t think her words mean anything.", "Yeahh, so no. She's not actually responsible for 1/3 of the basic chores of communal living. She needs to get it together or find her own place. You're not her mom. Or her maid. If her parents give you any stick about this, let them know that maid service in your city is about $X but honestly, the baby does actually need to grow up at some point.\n\nKeeping her own space clean and occasionally helping tidy the shared space doesn't help with dishes, meal planning, groceries, household management, bills, etc.", "That's also kinda shitty for you.\n\nAre you guys planning on getting married? Is he as serious as you are? The thing about married is that it does give you some protections for when things end.  \n\nYou sound like a tired wife, you're doing the work of one. Do you have the resources of a spouse? \n\nYou have been together for a significant amount of time. Where I live, you would be considered common law and so while the condo might not be considered marital property, the equity sure would be. \n\nHow are your savings going? Retirement? Financial goals? You deserve and need them for yourself.  Are you able to take your rent savings and build  future resources for yourself? Because your boyfriend definitely is.", "Why cant your boyfriend cook for her?

She can make a sandwich, right?", "She sounds exhausting. When I was fresh out of school and had a new job, I somehow managed to feed myself and function on a basic level.", "NTA.
