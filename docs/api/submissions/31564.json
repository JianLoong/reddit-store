He would, I assume care about his stepdaughters wellbeing and should really have issue with you\u2019re allowance of this. If she happens to sneak out again when you\u2019re not home but he is and she goes missing you would be mortified and likely put the blame on him for not being vigilant. You are undermining his parenting and concerns which she will pick up on and learn to disregard his opinions and concerns in the future", "NTA, but you should have told him. \n\nHe is an AH for wanting to punish her when his issue is really with you giving her permission and not discussing it with him. It's obviously wrong to punish her for something her parent gave her permission to do.", "I don't see why she should be punished when she asked permission and practically typed an agenda! You shouldn't have kept it from your husband, so YTA for that, not for letting your daughter pretend to sneak out.", "Let him punish her.

She just visited a friend.", "How is that sneaking out? She just left through the window not the door.", "NTA. Why does he even want to punish her? She *asked permission*, for crying out loud. Did she, like, climb down the lattice on the side of the house like in 80s movies? Could she have gotten hurt on her way out? That's the only thing I can imagine he'd be upset about.", "ESH. You should have told her dad. he\u2019s been in her life helping you raise her for 12 years. It\u2019s not like you\u2019re newly married and he has no say. So he\u2019s either a parent, or he isn\u2019t. But he can\u2019t be both.\n\nAlso him for wanting to punish her when his issue should be with you, not her.\n\nOnly non AH is your kid, for asking for permission to sneak out. Super wholesome and signs you both are doing a great job!", "NTA\n\nIt sounds like a very cute request from a 17 yo. You did a good job raising her. I don\u2019t understand what your husband has to be upset about? What does he want to punish her for?", "1) not really sneaking out if you ask permission and get it. Then its just leaving dramatically\n\n2) why wouldn't you just tell your spouse instead of ALLOWING tensions to form in your relationship?\n\n3) the big part of \u201csneaking\u201d out is the risk of being caught and punished so being grounded by dad is also a part of that \u201cexperience\u201d\n\n\nYta because this is all nonsense you handled poorly", "NTA. However, to get the full experience of sneaking out- perhaps she should be punished so that she will know how we felt when we forgot to cover our tracks and replace the window screens.

The person who wasn't in on it found out, therefore you got busted young lady!", "[deleted]", "Punish her for what, leaving via the window instead of the front door? Is he a person with no sense of humor, at all? \nNTA", "NTA. I would let the stepdad do a fake punishing  though because it'd be funny, or even let him think it's real. She wants the experience of sneaking out so you may as well give her the whole thing. All in good fun though.", "NTA\nyou gave her permission to sneak out and she sounds like a good kid. Your husband does not need to punish her for sneaking out because you gave her permission", "Lmaoooo I love how your kid really just doesn\u2019t want you worried about her lowkey. I do think you should\u2019ve told your husband.", "NTA and what an amazing duo! \nShe wanted a different experience, and she asked for it... The fact that she messed up, shows only one thing, she didn't do that before, she made mistakes that she wouldn't do if it wasn't the first time. \n\nI don't feel like you're an AH for not telling your husband, yes, his been in her life for 13 years, he is a father to her, but it would definitely not be a sneak out if everyone knew... But I also see his point, as a father he is worried, being blind sided left him worrying. But you knew everything that was going to happen, and if your kid asked permission for this, I'm dumb enough to believe that she is actually doing just what she said she would be doing. Once he discovered, you explained the situation, so I don't think there's a reason for any drama... It was just a small scare... I've done worst \ud83d\ude05", "NTA.\n\nI love the idea of giving her a **very light punishment** for not replacing the screen. I mean, the whole point of \"sneaking\" is to not be caught, and she failed.\n\nHowever, your **husband deserves a serious spanking**.", "I'm sorry, the idea of a daughter asking for permission to \"sneak out\" is just so cute!  Good kids trying to be bad and have a tiny rebellious phase!\n\nNTA - I think the things to ask your husband are:\n1- is he upset that you gave her permission to go out with friends without his knowing?  If so, his issue is with you, not her.\n\n2- is he upset that she crawled out the window instead of using the door?  Because if the answer to 1 is no, if you've given her permission to go out before without running it by him, then the issue really becomes that she used a window instead of a door. Is that really a thing to punish a kid for?\n\nHonestly, he should show her how to reattach the screen, and then be grateful that he has a kid whose biggest rebellious phase is checking with her mom before going out with friends, and then using the window instead of the door when she leaves.

And second he\u2019s not bio dad.\n\nBuuuuttt\u2026you should soooo do a fake punishment.  Tell her you caught the screen off the window and ask her if she snuck out.

Being punished for something you have permission to do has some major adverse affects on people.

Keep doing you. No comment on husband.", "NTA I snuck out when I was 16 and did same thing with forgetting the screen. My parents gave a me a small lecture but finally said, you\u2019re going to be an adult soon, if you want to go out at night then you can do so, just please tell us so we can call you if there\u2019s an emergency.\n\nThat was that. Never got in trouble again, never even wanted to go out that late again anyway.\n\nYour kid got straight up permission and is literally almost an adult. You don\u2019t \u201cpunish\u201d an adult with childish things like grounding or taking things away. Your partner seems insane for still wanting to punish her, nearly an adult, despite literally getting permission", "NTA but if you have permission then its not sneaking out", "NTA. You gave her permission so she literally didn't sneak out. All she did was hang out with a friend.", "Your husband really wants to keep the step-dad stereotypes strong hey?", "You're the mother. He's the step-father. And you gave her permission.\n\nIn fact, it's not even \"sneaking out\" *because* you gave permission. It was roleplaying sneaking out. Your husband is being a giant ass.\n\nNTA for not punishing her.\n\nIt'd be sadistic to punish her for something you told her to do.", "NTA My sister did the same thing with her teenagers. She gave them permission to sneak out as long as they were together and stayed safe. Your daughter didn't actually break any rules so there is nothing for your husband to punish. If he insists, he is the one ruining the holiday. You and your daughter can leave and do something fun without him.", "She's about to turn 18. Don't ruin the only ever experience of \"successfully sneaking out\" she'll have to look back on.", "That\u2019s what I thought as well: how cute to ask to SNEAK out xD it was nice of OP to give her that little thing. The stepdad however is out of line. The mother allowed it and even if he didn\u2019t know the daughter was not in the wrong. Punishing her for what? She asked to sneak out for heavens sake, that alone should show him that she is Indeed a well raised kid.", "Exactly. As part of the role play? Yeah why not. A token jokey gesture. But for real? What did she do that was wrong, can he explain?", "This is what I was thinking. \n\nTell her you noticed the screen wasn't in place so she must have snuck out and make her do the dishes or some other minor punishment", "I disagree about telling stepdad. She's pretending to sneak out. To make it work, there should be somebody who doesn't know.\n\nStepdad does come across as awfully literal and humorless, here.", "How in the world does that make her the asshole? What a ridiculous notion. It\u2019s her kid and they clearly have a strong line of communication. The fact he gets upset and his first inclination is to punish just goes to show he hasn\u2019t done much to earn trust in those 12 years. But yeah, she\u2019s the asshole for letting her daughter have an experience she requested in the most polite and respectful way possible. How silly", "Is it weird that I find this post...a little wholesome, however accidental it might be?\n\nLike, she doesn't want her parents to worry, so she tells them where she's going, when she's going, who she's going to be with, and *asks permission* before sneaking out.\n\nI do agree that the stepdad should have been told, but this whole scenario is kind of cute.", "I was going to say- OP should\u2019ve tipped off her husband beforehand, if only so he wouldn\u2019t get worried.", ">*I'm sorry, the idea of a daughter asking for permission to \"sneak out\" is just so cute!

You get all the responsibilities of parenthood with almost none of the love and respect. It also seems to create deeply entitled attitudes in the children that any human being owes them the world because they want it. Step-parent might work well if the kid is very young when the new parental figure comes on the scene. Otherwise it\u2019s a thankless position with an 80% likelihood of ending in divorce. The main reason my marriage is beating that statistic is because I firmly take the stance that my marriage comes before all the kids, even if he isn\u2019t the bio-dad of the older two."]}
