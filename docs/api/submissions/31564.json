If so, his issue is with you, not her.\n\n2- is he upset that she crawled out the window instead of using the door?  Because if the answer to 1 is no, if you've given her permission to go out before without running it by him, then the issue really becomes that she used a window instead of a door. Is that really a thing to punish a kid for?\n\nHonestly, he should show her how to reattach the screen, and then be grateful that he has a kid whose biggest rebellious phase is checking with her mom before going out with friends, and then using the window instead of the door when she leaves.

I'm sorry to say this but his behaviour is definitely inappropriate to the situation. \nYour daughter asked you to go out, but in a fun way, allowing her to \"sneak out\" to have the experience to having done that and you know she is not in a dangerous situation because you trust eachother and your daughter has never been the type of person that would make you worried. There should not be any kind of discussion or repercussions on the child seeing that there is no rule broken. \nThe thing that is worrying is that your husband wants to take such aggressive response to her going out just because you didn't tell him she was going out basically ( I may have read that he wanted to prohibit her from using the car and her phone iirc). If the punishment goes into effect I worry that your daughter may not be so inclined to trust your husband and you in the future: if something like this gets blown out of proportion she may not feel safe speaking to you or your husband in fear of it backfiring, and in the long run being unable to do so in case of emergency or necessity. \nI'm sorry if I rambled to much but I worry that this event may create a lot of harm if not handled properly. \nAlso once again your husband is showing some controlling behaviour that may not be noticeable much due to him showing it as worry.", "Do you and your daughter usually tell him or ask him about her going out with friends and does he normally just go along with things?

Does he often react aggressively to pretty minor stuff? His reaction to this is worrisome tbh.", "The only legit thing I can think of is him being concerned for her safety.

They've also been killed/injured by neighbors or law enforcement for the same reason.", "Bs!!if she's a good kid and trusts you enough to want to experience being bad I'd say you are the luckiest.

Maybe I'm wrong, but I have a feeling that he wouldn't have allowed it to happen in the first place, because he would have still considered it actual sneaking out even tho she would have gotten permission. To me his extreme overreaction to such a minor event is probably why it didn't get mentioned to him. Maybe it is feeling like he doesn't belong and maybe it's something else. I do agree there are things that need addressing here.", "Bro.  My children\u2019s step father is a second dad.  I see him as my equal.

If he has to know where she is 24/7, he's either a creep or an abusive control freak. Maybe both. \n\nThe point of sneaking out was sneaking out. She involved the parent she trusted - YOU - for safety. \n\nDo not let him convince you that you must share everything 100%. If he does that, your daughter will no longer be able to trust you with anything.\n\nI do hope that she can get away from him (and you) safely and soon.

By punishing her, because your husband can't handle not having a say in things, you've just showed her it's better not to ask you for anything because if your husband doesn't like it you'll do what he wants.

I was in a similar situation before as the kid but I think blowing it up early and finding out if you can work it out is way better than wasting years of your life only to learn that the situation would haunt you forever.", "I mean essentially she asked to go out and just happened to choose the window instead of the door.

When her mom told me, I offered to come along as her personal tutor \ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23 (granted, I\u2019ve known this family for like 17 years lol).

I wonder if he's always like this.", "Being \"black and white\" is stupid when we live in a world of grays.", "I mean depending on the situation telling someone afterwards can have serious reactions like this one here. If I found out my wife allowed my daughter sneak out of her bedroom through the window because she asked, and I found out the window was open and there was no daughter, I'd be terrified that she's gone and I don't know where she is. During that moment being told \"ok well don't worry I know where she is and I let her sneak out the window\" I'd ask \"why didn't you say something and just let her go out the front door?\" But being terrified that the daughter is gone, that wouldn't come out well.", "A child asking a parent to sneak out is an every day parenting decision?", "I\u2019m so glad!

I have always told my teenage sons if they ever are at a party and drunk and need me to come get them, idc what time it's at, they need to call me. Them being safe trumps me being mad any day. I would rather them wake me up and I'll come get them and any friends I can, then to drive under the influence or get in the car with anyone who is.", "Same. My parents have told me time and time again that if I ever need a ride for any reason, be it drinking at 2am, being fucked up at a party or just need a ride for anything I can call 24/7. They\u2019ll ask why but won\u2019t push it if I don\u2019t wanna say. Heck, I recall them straight up telling me they\u2019ll get me any drug I wanted to try so they\u2019ll know I\u2019m doing it in a safe location and that it\u2019s not laced. Never took them up on that but it has made it so that I hide absolutely nothing from them and trust them completely.", "My very first time getting high was off a nerds rope that my friend said was \u201ccandy\u201d.

Then when I got in the car when my dad picked me up he said \u201cwhat\u2019re you on\u201d and I explained the edible and they weren\u2019t mad, they were just concerned for me cause duh (I got drugged\u2026) and I came home and heated up fries and put sriracha and syrup on them and ate the whole bowl then went to bed and was high for 3 days afterwards.", "I\u2019ve been out of high school for literal decades and have a teen kid myself and my dad picked me up from my last high school reunion because I was too buzzed to drive safely and he didn\u2019t want me in an Uber at 10 pm.", "Hahaha I \u201cconfessed\u201d to my mom when I was around 40, and she laughed and said she never got any sleep those nights, even after we returned, because she worried until breakfast when she could see us. \n\nSHE KNEW! The thrill got old pretty quickly and we all did it a few times, she didn\u2019t want us to miss out on the thrill and knew we were smart, our neighborhood was safe and it was a different era.\n\nHeck, we all got in more trouble in broad daylight.

I\u2019ve been starting to set some boundaries because it\u2019s exhausting and I think she\u2019s drinking in ways that are unhealthy for her. Picking her up at odd times began as a safety net but is beginning to feel like enabling her to drink without consequence, so I\u2019m trying to change my approach... it\u2019s rough. She is pissed that I ordered an Uber home last night and used her money for it \u2014 but she had driven our only car, and when her plans changed and she got stranded, she expected me to maybe borrow someone else\u2019s car at 2am\u2026", "\ud83e\udd23\ud83e\udd23", "Unless he calms down enough to play along with the experience and \"catch her\" (and not actually ground her)", "I was such a rule followed as a kid and teen it was ridiculous.

I once had to drive to a nearby vacation hot spot on a very popular lake.    The kids were my oldest and several of his friends.   They were all in tears of shame by the time I got there and every last one of his friends were terrified that they in trouble.    They were all 17 or 18.   None of them was willing to drive or even tried to.   I was proud of them for that and brought them back to my house, had a talk with them about why what they did was dangerous.    They spent the night and went home the next day, I encouraged them to talk to their parents (all of them had arranged to stay at each other's houses so no one was missing and no worried parents) but I left it up to them because I knew some of them had really difficult parents and I wasn't willing to put a kid in danger from their parents.    Plus I wanted them to call me if they ever needed a ride in the future. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8 years later one of my sons friends called me blind drunk after having someone take him to a party and he didn't want to ride with the drunk friend.    I couldn't pick him up because I had moved but I hired him an Uber to get him home safely.    Then I thanked him for calling me and I waited on the phone with him till the Uber got there.    The next day when he remembered how to use apps again he venmo me the cash for the Uber ride and sent flowers to my work.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's never too late to make a difference in a kids life and make a lasting impact.

It took a lot of the mystery out of it and I went way less crazy in college than some of my friends.", "As the mother of 2 teens (who don\u2019t yet like alcohol), I love this idea!!\n\nMy cool aunt (much younger than my mom) let me get drunk (at a legal age) at the pub where she was working.

It helped me learn my limits, and plus, me and all the punk rock homies would chill with them, watching movies, playing games, etc. \n\nI'm lucky my parents were metalheads who never acted stupid, they knew we would drink and stuff, cause they did it too at our age, they never lied to themselves about what the scene is. \nI love my parents.", "Our oldest was going to a party once in HS, and we knew because we were dropping her off. Once she found out that some of the kids were going to hotbox a room and trip acid, she texted us that day from school. She wanted to let us know. We told her we wouldn\u2019t say that she couldn\u2019t go to the party - we left it as her choice. But we also asked her to please make good choices as she was taught, and to remember if the party got busted that she would face the consequences and potentially get stripped of her swimming season. She chose to go ahead and go, and we chose to trust her. She said her friends respected her and hotbox a room she didn\u2019t go in, and she just avoided the acid. We could tell she wasn\u2019t high when we picked her up. We needed to let her learn to navigate those situations at 16 with our guidance so she could think it through and make her own rational thought process and choices when she wasn\u2019t under our constant supervision. Now she\u2019s grown and does occasionally use weed, but we also don\u2019t care because we\u2019re pro-legalization.", "I never thought I would find someone who I could comiserate about this type of parenting with.\n\nWhen I was 15 (almost 16), my best friend did coke with her boyfriend before a group of us went to a concert and they didn't tell any of the rest of us. They were both hard to wrangle and we ended up with police questioning us because we were arguing outside the concert and she couldn't manage to call our ride (her mother) and only very narrowly avoided getting in major trouble because she was being uncommunicative and unmanageable. I was quite mad at her for a while, and driving by her house one day my dad asked me why I hadn't seen her recently. In an uncharacteristically honest moment for me I explained to him what happened (without ALL the details). His response was to tell me I should \"lighten up and live a little\", as though I should have joined her in reveling in the coke.(I had smoked plenty of cannabis that night but left that part out of my retelling)"]}
