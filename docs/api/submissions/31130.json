I was ecstatic, then she told me it was a Bajaj Qute. I don't know a lot about cars and have never heard about this one before, but she said it was cheap, low maintenance, fuel-efficient, and very small - things I was looking for.\n\nI decided to look up the car and while everything my mother said seemed true, some things alarmed me - among them, the fact that it has no airbags and performed very poorly on crash tests, particularly the Euro and Global NCAP.\n\nWhen I discussed my concerns with my mother and asked if she had checked the car's specifications before getting it, she replied she had already bought it and it was on its way, I shouldn't pay attention to \"how people normally make use of their vehicles\", and that the Qute is basically everything I need. I told her I'm extremely worried about driving a vehicle without airbags in our city (the country we live in is rather infamous for its road-rage or drivers not abiding by traffic regulations, plus the streets aren't exactly smooth as silk) and potentially ending up in a fatal accident, to which she responded that the whole idea should be to *NOT* do anything that gets you in an accident... Which I sort of agree with, yet I can't very well control how other drivers behave and think it's just tempting fate to forego what I'd consider basic safety measures.\n\nEventually, I wondered out loud that perhaps it would be possible to trade in the Qute for another car (I'd pay whatever the difference would be, obviously), and she went ballistic, calling me an ungrateful brat that can't appreciate the sacrifice she's making for me (she's not exactly well-off).\n\nI retorted this wasn't about ungratefulness, since I do appreciate her going out of her way to buy a car for me (it's not like she's legally or even morally forced/required to do that), but more about not feeling safe driving that particular vehicle and trying to  find options that I'm comfortable with.\n\nThe argument got heated and in the end she shouted whether I wanted the car or not. I angrily went, \"No can bloody do, thank you very much!\" before leaving the house to try and cool my head.\n\nI had walked perhaps an hour before my phone went crazy with notifications - apparently, my mother had called several family members, mutual friends and acquaintances to let them know I didn't want to drive the car she got for me. Almost everyone berated me for being such an ungrateful, entitled, dramatic AH.\n\nAs of now, only 2 friends agree I'm within my rights to refuse a gift that could potentially harm me and that it wasn't a bad thing to consider changing it if I did accept it. 10+ people think otherwise, that I should definitely accept the Qute, keep it, and apologise to my mother.\n\nSo I'm asking - AITA?", "created_utc": 1700194317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17x6nvi/aitah_for_refusing_to_drive_a_car_my_mother/", "score": 17, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should\u2019ve thought before pushing the type of gift on you that\u2019s a huge commitment.\nI personally would feel very trapped if someone gave me that kind of gift without my input at all. But you are under no obligation to accept it. It was inconsiderate of her, if anything.", "NTA. Your mother is controlling and problematic. You\u2019re an adult. If she wanted to give you money to buy your car it would be one thing. Or actually pick the car you asked for. But she made the decision like you were 16, chose something unsafe, and expected you to have zero opinion.", "NTA.  This is the kind of gift that needs communication!  Cars are very personal choices.  Nice gift but she should have talked to you first.", "NTA.  I'd never drive an unsafe car.\n\n\"the whole idea should be to NOT do anything that gets you in an accident.\"\n\nIs she aware of what 'accident' means?  Because based on this statement she doesn't.", "NTA. She knew you were looking for a certain car model, and instead of offering you some money to buy it if she couldn't buy it for you, she decided to get a cheaper, less safe one because how else is she gonna hold it over your head in any arguments like this one. This car was going to be a birthday gift with strings attached, not something given out of kindness and generosity, a way to show you that she's actually trying to mend the relationship that was previously damaged. It was a controll tool for her to use in the future.", "NTA. This is the first thing people should consider when purchasing a vehicle. Your mother was very silly to purchase an unsafe car", "So not NTA!", "It\u2019s not a car it\u2019s a moped on 4 wheels\u2026", "Wow, this sounds like such a narcissistic reaction on your mother's part. \"I do everything for you, yet you don't appreciate anything,\" she cries, while she gives you something you did not want.\n\nAnd now you're the ungrateful person, who has to pretend to be grateful so you don't rock the boat.\n\nDoes she do other\"self sacrificing\" stuff you did not ask for, and does she cry if you're not thankful enough?\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!
