I was ecstatic, then she told me it was a Bajaj Qute. I don't know a lot about cars and have never heard about this one before, but she said it was cheap, low maintenance, fuel-efficient, and very small - things I was looking for.\n\nI decided to look up the car and while everything my mother said seemed true, some things alarmed me - among them, the fact that it has no airbags and performed very poorly on crash tests, particularly the Euro and Global NCAP.\n\nWhen I discussed my concerns with my mother and asked if she had checked the car's specifications before getting it, she replied she had already bought it and it was on its way, I shouldn't pay attention to \"how people normally make use of their vehicles\", and that the Qute is basically everything I need. I told her I'm extremely worried about driving a vehicle without airbags in our city (the country we live in is rather infamous for its road-rage or drivers not abiding by traffic regulations, plus the streets aren't exactly smooth as silk) and potentially ending up in a fatal accident, to which she responded that the whole idea should be to *NOT* do anything that gets you in an accident... Which I sort of agree with, yet I can't very well control how other drivers behave and think it's just tempting fate to forego what I'd consider basic safety measures.\n\nEventually, I wondered out loud that perhaps it would be possible to trade in the Qute for another car (I'd pay whatever the difference would be, obviously), and she went ballistic, calling me an ungrateful brat that can't appreciate the sacrifice she's making for me (she's not exactly well-off).\n\nI retorted this wasn't about ungratefulness, since I do appreciate her going out of her way to buy a car for me (it's not like she's legally or even morally forced/required to do that), but more about not feeling safe driving that particular vehicle and trying to  find options that I'm comfortable with.\n\nThe argument got heated and in the end she shouted whether I wanted the car or not. I angrily went, \"No can bloody do, thank you very much!\" before leaving the house to try and cool my head.\n\nI had walked perhaps an hour before my phone went crazy with notifications - apparently, my mother had called several family members, mutual friends and acquaintances to let them know I didn't want to drive the car she got for me. Almost everyone berated me for being such an ungrateful, entitled, dramatic AH.\n\nAs of now, only 2 friends agree I'm within my rights to refuse a gift that could potentially harm me and that it wasn't a bad thing to consider changing it if I did accept it. 10+ people think otherwise, that I should definitely accept the Qute, keep it, and apologise to my mother.\n\nSo I'm asking - AITA?", "created_utc": 1700194317, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/17x6nvi/aitah_for_refusing_to_drive_a_car_my_mother/", "score": 61, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

She should\u2019ve thought before pushing the type of gift on you that\u2019s a huge commitment.\nI personally would feel very trapped if someone gave me that kind of gift without my input at all. But you are under no obligation to accept it. It was inconsiderate of her, if anything.", "NTA. Your mother is controlling and problematic. You\u2019re an adult. If she wanted to give you money to buy your car it would be one thing. Or actually pick the car you asked for. But she made the decision like you were 16, chose something unsafe, and expected you to have zero opinion.", "NTA.  This is the kind of gift that needs communication!  Cars are very personal choices.  Nice gift but she should have talked to you first.", "NTA.  I'd never drive an unsafe car.\n\n\"the whole idea should be to NOT do anything that gets you in an accident.\"\n\nIs she aware of what 'accident' means?  Because based on this statement she doesn't.", "NTA. She knew you were looking for a certain car model, and instead of offering you some money to buy it if she couldn't buy it for you, she decided to get a cheaper, less safe one because how else is she gonna hold it over your head in any arguments like this one. This car was going to be a birthday gift with strings attached, not something given out of kindness and generosity, a way to show you that she's actually trying to mend the relationship that was previously damaged. It was a controll tool for her to use in the future.", "NTA. This is the first thing people should consider when purchasing a vehicle. Your mother was very silly to purchase an unsafe car", "So not NTA!", "It\u2019s not a car it\u2019s a moped on 4 wheels\u2026", "Wow, this sounds like such a narcissistic reaction on your mother's part. \"I do everything for you, yet you don't appreciate anything,\" she cries, while she gives you something you did not want.\n\nAnd now you're the ungrateful person, who has to pretend to be grateful so you don't rock the boat.\n\nDoes she do other\"self sacrificing\" stuff you did not ask for, and does she cry if you're not thankful enough?\n\nNTA", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting!

Front the amount you're willing to spend and specify the purchase, eg. for a car, by all means but let them pick. I know I have requirements for such things. \n\nAlso, where do you live that air bags aren't required?", "NTA - Tell your mum to get off the cross we need the wood. I would tell her to jam her car on principle at this point. Are you sure it's worth mending a relationship with this person??", "They're marketing it as a taxi, at least on the website.  I think I'd rather walk.", "NTA.\n\nIt's not legally a car, it is classified as a quadcycle. It's the first 4 wheeler from the maker of auto rickshaws.\n\nSo, it's... not a car. If you are looking for a car, this is not the vehicle for you. Because it's not a car. It's not even about the safety or anything else. The qute is doing exactly what it was designed to do - not be a car.", "I\u2019ve bought my 2 grandkids cars this year as they\u2019ve passed their tests. I certainly ensured they were safe enough for them to drive. I did the same when my daughter passed her test 30 years ago. \n\nIf your buying a car for your child or anyone else for that matter, you ensure it\u2019s safe to drive. I didn\u2019t even realise they made cars nowadays without airbags \n\nNTA", "NTA. Someone I used to know died before he reached 21, because he got hit by an idiot driver while on the expressway and his car wasn't new enough to have airbags in the doors too, instead of just the dashboard.  \nYour life is worth more than your mother's ego, always.", "Those 10+ people are idiots and your mother is a brat. No one in their right mind buys something like a car without finding out what the recipient wants and needs. If she is adamant about giving you the car, make sure it is solely in your name and immediately trade it in for the one you want. Otherwise, move out and move on. Leave her and her flying monkeys behind you.", "NTA. And anyone who moans can swap their car for this thing. I'd drive a 10 year old Golf rather than this. It's ultra light, so no impact cage, no airbags, max speed 70 KPH (Really? I doubt it goes that fast) No, it's simply not going to be safe in modern traffic.

What you could have done was say, thanks, mum! Then immediately traded it in for a safe car. When she saw you drive up in the other car, you could then tell her about the safety issues and thank her again for helping you toward this safe car.", "Right?\n\nI\u2019m 41 and have been driving since I was 16. I am a damned good driver, too, if I may say so. I\u2019ve taken defensive driving courses and have never caused an accident or gotten a moving vehicle violation. I was a passenger in a rollover when I was 18 and was lucky to walk away with bruises only (thank you, safety belts!). I am a conscientious, prudent driver. I have narrowly avoided my share of accidents thanks to good training and quick reflexes.\n\nAnd yet\u2026 not every accident is avoidable.\n\nIn 2019, an asshole was going 105+ MPH when he lost control of his car, spun out, and slammed into me head-on.  It was a sunny Saturday afternoon, no inclement road conditions, but it didn\u2019t stop him losing control. The speed limit was 65, which is what I was going.\n\nDude died instantly in his Mustang, which then caught fire. I was trapped for two hours in my car, the steering wheel inside my abdomen and my legs crushed. My jaw was shattered and had to be reconstructed with titanium. I had a dozen surgeries, facial reconstruction, broke 30+ bones, have 5+ feet of scars, 1 foot of titanium plating in total, and had to re-learn how to breathe, swallow water, eat, talk, walk, etc. I was in ICU for a month, then a month in the main hospital, then another month in a nursing home/rehab home.\n\nI am STILL an excellent driver with a perfect driving record\u2026 who is now permanently disabled thanks to a shitty driver.\n\nOP: You are very much NTA. Even if 99% of your driving experience is in your control\u2026 that 1% can and WILL screw up your life and even potentially end it. You are not wrong for wanting to protect yourself. And, honestly, it really sucks that you have a parent that doesn\u2019t seem to want their child in the safest car they can afford. Ugh.
