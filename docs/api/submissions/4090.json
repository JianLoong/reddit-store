I took the lead in funeral arrangements I had asked my sister (f33) \u201cAnnie\u201d and brother (m37) to contribute towards the costs. My mom unfortunately didn\u2019t have life insurance, and we couldn\u2019t sell the house to pay for things because my dad still wants to live in their house alone.\n\nSo my brother paid his share, and Annie said she was tight on money at the time and asked me to cover her share. She promised to pay my back within 6 months. I was not really okay with this arrangement because Annie has in the past not paid back money she owed to other family members. But we were all grieving, and I thought it would be different since I\u2019m her sister. So I agreed. Annie never paid the money back, even after I asked 3 times. Didn\u2019t bring it up again after the third time. \n\nNow yesterday, she posts photos of her family vacation to Disneyland with her husband and two kids. I commented on her post saying, \u201cMust be nice!\u201d The comment was up for a while and other family and friends message me to ask me what that meant. I didn\u2019t say anything to them about the situation. Eventually, Annie saw the comment and messaged me, furious. \n\nI told her that it was a slap in the face that she would spend thousands of dollars on a vacation before paying me back the thousands of dollars she owes me. I too have a family that I would have liked to take on vacation, but my vacation money (and more) pretty much went towards paying for mom\u2019s funeral.\n\nShe told me that it was very disrespectful that I would comment something like that. And that it \u201churts\u201d her that I am telling her that she shouldn\u2019t have taken her family on vacation. \n\nAnnie screenshot our conversation and posted in on FB, like a child. A lot of family members are agreeing with Annie. \n\nSo I didn\u2019t think I was an asshole, but now I\u2019m wondering if I might have been.", "created_utc": 1670338131, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ze8ndw/aita_for_making_a_passive_aggressive_comment_on/", "score": 185, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

So most of the basic needs for her son where covered by WIC.  They didn\u2019t qualify for full benefits and were having trouble making ends meet.  So we offered to help buy some formula and diapers at one point so that they would have an extra supply for growth spurt and times when he went through more than normal amount of diapers.  Instead of continuing to buy diapers as before to keep up they decided to buy a bunch of cigarettes and alcohol with the money they were using for their son.

If you have anything in writing saying she was going to pay you her portion within X time, let her know you'll take it to small claims court if she doesn't abide by the payment plan.

So then when sister says- but you didn't have to air all this publicly, the answer is- I did because you not only flaunted the fact that you had the money and weren't repaying me PUBLICLY but then you attempted to shame me as though I don't have a legit cause for concern about the fact that you owe me and aren't paying.", "Someone\u2019s shitty behavior doesn\u2019t justify you being shitty in response.

To you, having that high road is more important than correcting the understanding that has been shared publicly. \n\nIt's fine, we can disagree. I don't see where letting the misrepresentation stand actually makes her look better or where correcting it makes her look worse. The fact is, she's owed money and most, if not all the criticism being leveled at her is occurring because folks don't know that. Why are you so afraid of the truth?", "Yes, I am saying taking the high road is better. I\u2019m not afraid of the truth when the conversation is subjective. I\u2019m also not going to take anymore of my time with this discussion, as we both actively disagree and it\u2019s not going to be fruitful. Have a nice rest of your day."]}
