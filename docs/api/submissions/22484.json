{"id": 22484, "submission_id": "1524p9p", "title": "AITA for calling my stepsister the \"ugly stepsister\" because she freaked out over a nickname?", "selftext": "My (F29) family jokingly refers to me as \u201cPrincess/The Princess\u201d, because I have a reputation for being opinionated and sensitive. This is mostly because of sensory issues, so certain noises or textures grate on me to an extent that I will leave the room or avoid touching things. I\u2019m also just a picky person and I like things how I like them. So my stepdad started referring to me as the Princess, like \u201cdon\u2019t open the car window, the Princess will get upset\u201d. My stepbrothers and mum use it as well. It\u2019s a running family joke, well meant, I\u2019ve never been offended by it in the 15 years it\u2019s been a thing. My stepsister, Georgia (F30) hates it. She used to snap whenever anyone said it but over the years she just started making the odd passive aggressive comment about it. Everyone ignores it, because Georgia has a habit of thinking everything is about her, and if it's not about her, the reason it's not about her is because we all hate her, which then is still about her.\n\nSo, our whole family is visiting my parents in the countryside for a couple of weeks. Georgia has brought her boyfriend Jason along. I\u2019ve met Jason a couple of times before at dinners and he\u2019s a nice guy, and he\u2019s fit in well. \n\nThis morning, me and my mum were making breakfast and Jason came down and to help out. We normally have breakfast in the kitchen/diner so eventually everyone started gathering at the table. We always make the tea and coffee last so it\u2019s hot when we eat and we had all the mugs out and Jason offered to make the drinks. I told him not to do mine because I liked it made a very particular way, and he said \u201cokay Princess I will just watch how you do it so I know for next time\u201d and we laughed. It. Was. A. Joke. \n\nThe next thing we know, Georgia shouts she\u2019s sick of everyone calling me. She then swore at Jason for being \u201cjust like them (us)\u201d. She said since everyone thinks I\u2019m so special what does that make her, and I replied \u201cthe ugly stepsister, obviously\u201d. No one said anything, but Georgia burst into tears, pushed her plate onto the floor (broke it) and went upstairs, and Jason ran after her. He\u2019s since come down to apologise for her, she hasn\u2019t come out of her room. \n\nMy stepbrothers are on my side, the parents say I should have just not said anything and she would have calmed down, and that I went too far picking at an insecurity. That might be true, but I\u2019m sick of her making everything about her. The joke doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her, and I am (as are my stepbrothers) sick of her acting out to force everyone to behave how she wants them to. \n\nAm I the AH for taking the argument there?", "created_utc": 1689606779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1524p9p/aita_for_calling_my_stepsister_the_ugly/", "score": 813, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You paint her as self-centered, but I\u2019d bet that she has felt subordinate to you her whole life, and is trying to claw back some of that attention for herself.\n\nAs \u2018Princess\u2019, your very particular needs and wants probably grate on the people around you to some extent. They have probably spent their lives catering to your picky personality, and under that friendly family joke lies a bit of real resentment. To be blunt, YOU are the center of attention, and YOU have become accustomed to it. \n\nThe way to fix this is to apologize to your sister, try and have a dialogue with her about this, and try to be a bit less particular in your own wants when it puts an extra burden on those around you.\n\nYOUR COMFORT IS NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE AROUND YOU.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Being overly picky doesn't make you special or give you the right to call someone else ugly. Apologize and mean it.", "YTA. It sounds like your stepsister is constantly feeling ignore because your the princess of the family and I get it based on everything you said. It seems like you always get your way because you are picky and sensitive. And then to insult her afterwards is just way too far. It also seems like everything is about you as you are the \"princess\" as they refer to you.", "YTA. You called her ugly. But your story really paints you as the ugly stepsister- opinionated, sensitive and calling people names.", "Info:\n\nHas anyone asked why you sarcastically being called \"Princess\" bothers her? \n\nWas it a pet name used for her by her dad, and then your step dad started calling you that instead? Has she always felt in competition of you?", "YTA and people calling you princess are TA too. Even though you're not offended, it doesn't sound like a term of endearment (or something) when being used the way you describe. I might be wrong, but to me it sounds belittling. Anyway definitely yta for the ugly stepsister comment. As an actual non-attractive (ugly) person I can vouch that even as a \"joke\" that would feel horrible to hear.", "YTA. \n\nThis is one of those where I would really love your stepsister\u2019s side of the story. It sounds like you were attended to by both your parents and her brothers while she was not included much in any of those dynamics. If she feels like you were spoiled and coddled, \u201cPrincess\u201d kinda reinforces that your family readily attended to you. It\u2019s hard to tell if you\u2019re the golden child and she\u2019s reacting to that, or if she\u2019s too sensitive.\n\nEither way, calling her the ugly stepsister was super unnecessary. Her boyfriend apologizing for her also gives me the ick. She\u2019s allowed to be upset by you saying something hurtful.", "YTA. What you said makes YOU the ugliest stepsister.", "ESH.

Being not offended when someone refers to you as \u2018princess\u2019 is not the same thing as not taking offense when someone calls you an \u2018ugly stepsister\u2019. You know she hates the princess thing, obvs, and it\u2019s pretty clear that it\u2019s bc she\u2019s jealous. Now she has to listen to her *boyfriend* also call you Princess and hear you insult her? What a family. You know what you could have said when she asked what she was? \u2018Another Princess, since we\u2019re sisters, silly\u2019", "YTA\n\n\nI don't believe that you don't understand why she is bothered by everyone in her family including her boyfriend calling you princess. It may have started because you are picky or whatever, but the word princess comes with being beautiful, special, royal, etc\n\nAnd for however many years everyone has called you that excluding her.\n\nJust for that your family are mayor assholes. \n\nAnd then the boyfriend says it too. Another asshole.\n\nBut you, not only disregarded her feelings all this years,  you obviously thrive on being the special girl of the family, but intentionally embarrassed her in front of her boyfriend.  YTA and a pick me, and honestly is really pathetic at your age", "YTA. Such a mean girls moment.", "YTA. You say she always makes everything about her, but it sounds like it\u2019s always about you. Princess this, princess that, sounds a bit self centered, no?", "\"It's because we all hate her.\"\n\nIf your parents have confirmed this, then it's you and them that are the problem.", "YTA. Calling your sister like that makes you the ugly stepsister honestly. Her bf also sucks... When is clear there is resentment about a joke that she is been ranting about for a while, and being ignored. But it shows you nor your family care at all about how this joke makes her feel and to top it you called her ugly. Mean and AH.", "ESH.\n\nI'm confused as to why you accuse someone of making \"everything about her,\" when you're the one in charge as Princess of the castle. \n\nAnd you think the \"princess\" nickname is well-meant? It is a coping mechanism to help everyone around you deal with your pickiness. They're laughing at you so they don't get irritated every time you dictate your preferences.\n\nYou seem to think \"princess\" is a literal description of your role within the family.\n\nGeorgia is the only one not playing along here. Crazy.", "YTA, that comment wasn\u2019t necessary. You picked at an insecurity and hit home hard meanwhile your nickname really has no bad meaning or association tied to it. She probably feels insignificant to you, and you just doubled down on making her feel lesser.", "YTA. You could have gone with invisible, ignored, former, forgotten, OG princess, you didn't have to say \"ugly\" while flirting with her boyfriend. \n\nClearly after the merged family, she felt replaced as the only girl by a high maintenance person who now gets all the attention.", "YTA.

You weren't an asshole up until you called her ugly. I mean come on, obviously that's over the line regardless of how weird and annoying she's being.\n\nEven if she deserved it, even if it's true, you're still an asshole for saying it.\n\nYou should apologize to her, but make it part of a bigger conversation.\n\nMaybe start with \"of course I don't think you're ugly, I was just leaning into the trope because you keep making it into such a big deal. I'm sorry I said that, it was out of line. Can we talk about why you flip out over something that is obviously just a good natured running joke?\"", "YTA! Why would you refer to anyone as ugly, period? You said you're sensitive also, but your stepsister isn't afforded the same understanding for also being sensitive. She's allowed to be tired of everyone referring to you as a princess. While it may be a joke, did you not listen to her feeling of what does that make her? Her own father (allegedly) doesn't see his biological daughter as his princess, yet you think she's overreacting and makes everything about her. Seems to me, here, from reading this, you don't like it when it's not all about you. Perhaps you both are a reflection of one another. Either way, YTA here, you owe her an apology.", "YTA re-read the post EVERYTHING is about you.", "YTA and incredibly entitled.   You actually came here to ask and obviously were certain everyone would agree with you because you won't even accept judgements.   The entire post just reeks of being self centered and relishing being able to dictate how things are.    You read like a villainess from a Disney movie.", "YTA.  You sound insufferable and that everything is about you.  Maybe you displaced her as princess. This princess thing isn\u2019t cute or really complimentary.  It\u2019s not doing you any good.", "YTA. I find it funny that you say that everything revolves around her, when it sounds more like everything revolves around you and your pickiness. And while she did overreact, this is likely just the straw that broke the camels back and calling her the ugly step sister made it so much worse. She probably has felt consistently less important than you.", "You're too hard on her. An apology is appropriate and kind, no matter how much you don't want to.", "YTA - I\u2019m also betting she doesn\u2019t have a cute nickname. So you messed up big time - I mean I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t throw a fit when things have to be done your way and your way only. I bet she had to walk on eggshells bc your family always catered to your needs (I\u2019m gonna assume you have seen a doctor and have been diagnosed with sensory processing issues and these aren\u2019t your wants for). She has gone at half her life making sure your needs and let\u2019s face it I\u2019m sure many of the things are your preferences and aren\u2019t needs. For example, having a cup of tea that isn\u2019t burn your mouth is a preference but not eating mushy food may be a sensory need. Apologize and get some empathy", "YTA and it sounds like you\u2019re the self-centered one.", "YTA", "YTA. You got big Pick Me energy. Yuck.", "ESH. She's an idiot, but she was being annoying, not hurtful; you actually hurt her feelings intentionally. Not cool.", "ESH? \n\nThem for picking on you...for 15 years?\n\nYou for apparently being okay with your bullies?\n\nThe bf for falling in line with being a bully \n\nYour step sister for not realizing your family is a bunch of bullies.\n\nBut here's the thing....at some point (that your sister recognized) it changed from bullying to actual affection. She stopped defending you because she saw the switch. It's clear you don't like her. I wonder what your mom thinks of her... she now thinks that you all have a code running joke that you are the actual princess/golden child, you've even got her bf in on it, and she's sick of it.", "I believe you already know the answer, you just don\u2019t want to admit it\u2026 YTA", "The kind thing to say would have been \u201ca princess\u2019s sister is also a princess\u201d.", "YTA.\n\nYeah. Her behaviour is beyond the pale, but you don't lower yourself to that level. It was just unnecessary and you admitted you targeted an insecurity.\n\nI'd apologise for what I said, but clarify why I said it.", "YTA, you have been picky, selfish and spoiled for years and your family started calling you princess because you have been acting like an entitled, spoiled princess for years.  You seem to enjoy being called princess because it means you can keep acting like a spoiled, entitled princess and it makes you think your behavior is okay, when really your family has been just calling you that because that's the only way to deal with you. \n\n\nThen even your step sisters boyfriend started catering to your princess demands and she justifiably lost it after 14 years of dealing with your BS. And your response was just to call her names rather than being a nearly 30 year old woman who had never understood that being called \"princess\" due to being demanding and controlling is a bad thing.", "ESH. Your sensory issues are valid and the joke isn't so bad since you like it. But, it gives me pick me vibes that a grown ass 30 year old still likes to being called a fucking princess. Honestly, her extreme reaction makes me think that you were the golden child but that's not why you are the asshole. She was an asshole overall for her behavior but your answer was so tasteless and low that you were way worse, Princess.", "I\u2019m torn, I\u2019m tempted to write ESH, your step sister needs to grow up, but you shouldn\u2019t have said what you said. She\u2019s obviously sensitive and there\u2019s something going on there. She might be struggling with things u don\u2019t know of and her BF saying that nickname was the last straw. And if the nickname was Cinderella it would have made sense in a Joke scenario BUT instead u just came off as a bit of a dick :( she should have also talked to her boyfriend and warned him that it\u2019s sensitive to her", "Bro, yall are grown ass adults and are acting like this? \n\nShould she have blown up, no, but that honestly seems like years of repressed emotions. Should you have called her the ugly stepsister, no, but i get the knee-jerk defensiveness.\n\nBoth of you need to sit down and have a productive conversation if you want to have a healthy relationship with one another.", "YTA.  You're bragging about being high maintenance, and saying everyone hates your sister.  I'd say that makes you and your whole personality ugly and entitled.", "ESH\n\nYes yta for saying that, but her issue over a nickname that isn\u2019t about her is a problem.  To many being called \u201cthe princess\u201d in the context you cite would be an insult.  But you have a compatible sense of humor so it works great and you all, except her, are fine with it\n\nIf she had an issue because she read it as insulting and was defending you be one thing-though would still need to get over it as YOU were ok.\n\nBasically it reads she\u2019s jealous or feeling unloved as isn\u2019t getting same attention.  That may be a family \u201cgolden one\u201d issue, or it may be things she\u2019s caused.  Hard to say, but doesn\u2019t make her outburst or your response ok", "YTA - I have a sibling that I jokingly used to call princess as well because it\u2019s EXHAUSTING dealing with people who expect everyone to constantly cater to them. Newsflash, you\u2019re not offended because your family would seemingly rather give in and let you get your way than deal with whatever tantrums you might throw when you don\u2019t. \n\nSounds like this started when you were 15ish and instead of maturing and growing up, you embraced it. Your stepsister on the other hand is probably rightfully over you being favorited and getting your way.", "Yta.", "YTA", "ESH - you could have gone with anything non-looks related & I\u2019d have said the step-sister was 100% wrong.

Definitely.", "ESH\n\nNormally calling someone ugly would be Y T A, but a 15 year old self-esteem issue that bursts out because her BF called you a nickname ... yeah, your sister is also to blame, but also may need therapy.", "YTA. Like someone else said, you could\u2019ve replied with anything else besides the \u201cugly stepsister.\u201d I\u2019m guessing you were making a reference to Cinderella and her mean, self-absorbed stepsisters. Was it witty? Yes. Was it necessary to say that in front of her boyfriend? No. It was very mean-spirited, especially after the whole interaction with you and her boyfriend that clearly made her feel uncomfortable.

After all, you did embarrass her publicly so you should apologize publicly.", "yikes huge yta", "I really feel like I missed something or something was edited before I got here. I can maybe see ESH for the name-calling, but no one is a bigger AH in this scenario than the one who can't handle your nickname. You're 29 and she's 30. Who cares what your family calls you?

Wow. YTA", "YTA and sound insufferable", "Even if you're entirely right about everything else and your sister is too sensitive/overreacting (I say if because it's hard to know from your perspective if you were actually the golden child and she's upset for a reason), YTA for that response. That was mean and petty, and surely you knew she would get even more upset. So even if you thought she was being childish, why drop to that level too and make a mean joke that picks at her sore spot? Try to be the bigger person next time.", "Sounds like some good old fashion sibling bickering to me. I thought your joke was pretty funny and just about anyone with thicker-than-paper skin would probably laugh about it too.

At some point you give up walking on eggshells around then because why should you have to live you life like that but it\u2019s still problematic.", "YTA, it\u2019s not the nickname so much as it is the way you treat your step sis. I imagine there is a huge difference on how everyone treated her. What you did was cruel and in front on her boyfriend. That was a pick me moment you can be better. It\u2019s one thing to be funny it\u2019s another to suggest your step sis was inferior. Personally I always thought of princess as an insult. I would never let people call me that.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re both grown adults. The way that both you and your sister are acting is wild to me. Grow up.

I had to double check your age when I read this. You sound like a 16y/o girl who thrives on attention, not a 29 y/o woman.

Calling her the ugly step sister knowing she has insecurities is cruel and you know it. I can understand why step sister wasn't happy her boyfriend joined in on the joke. Don't you say the family hates her in the post? Yeah that's nasty and I can see why step sister is irritated by family doing things ur way because you are not flexible. Apologise to her.

And your comments cement how selfish you are.", "You're 29 years old, please get over yourself OP.", "YTA and she\u2019s also probably annoyed because you are literally the princess of the family and I find it funny you say she gets mad when everything isn\u2019t about her, but you literally sound like you can\u2019t deal with not everything being about you. It sounds like stepsister is constantly pushed to the side for you because you\u2019re the princess of the family. I can\u2019t lie if my boyfriend called someone princess I\u2019d also be annoyed about it. You called her ugly because you want to be the pretty princess with all the attention so you put her down.

Its making a joke of your very well known(to your fam) \"quirk \" or sensory issues (im unclear, my apologies, sensory issues make you all the more NTA) that some might consider a flaw- having a particular way of making tea- oh theyre uptight! What a princess! And you took that well because it was honest to you, instead of letting it hurt you (which, idk why but good for you!). But that doesn't mean it's a good connotation, your stepsister doesn't get it but she is being The Princess.", "YTA obviously. I think you still don't get that calling you princess, while it sounds funny to you, it's not for them. It's not a compliment. You sound insufferable.", "So at age 15 (an age where people are famous for thinking rationally) a young girl went from being her dad\u2019s only daughter to suddenly having a stepsister 1 year younger than her that he started calling a princess. I\u2019m guessing that to Georgia, this seemed like you became her dad\u2019s favourite daughter, which made her resent the nickname. The whole family picked up on the nickname and whenever she expressed that she doesn\u2019t like it you used that as justification for believing she thinks everything is about her. \n\nYour stepdad and Georgia should have sat down and had a proper conversation about this a long time ago, and you should have learnt to be less opinionated and sensitive a long time ago too. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s actually made everything about you, and Georgia is understandably fed up with it. \n\nWhen even Georgia\u2019s boyfriend picked up on it and started calling you princess (sometimes seen as an affectionate nickname between partners) she snapped, and in response you insulted her. Almost guaranteed she\u2019d been thinking of herself as the ugly stepsister for a long time, she didn\u2019t need you confirming it for her. \n\nNow, is Georgias response to a nickname logical or fair, no, and does she kinda suck for turning something small at face value into such a big issue, yes.

The way you want it, is the way things are.\n\nNo doubt your stepsister feels like she got short-changed in her family. a LOT of new step-parents bend over backwards to play nice with the new stepkids and this may have happened here, where your SD over-did his fussing over you to impress your mother.\n\nHope your Stepsister goes to therapy to undo the harm your family cause to her. You won't ever see it because you were never neglected or cast aside. \n\nSo YTA but your mind may not be able to comprehend it without therapy yourself to see how awful her life was.", "I think you are an ass whose personality has probably been a lot more irksome than you really have addressed.

Are you really so lacking in sensitivity that you can\u2019t understand that what you did was hurtful?", "See you got this whole thing backwards.

This is mostly because of sensory issues, so certain noises or textures grate on me to an extent that I will leave the room or avoid touching things. I\u2019m also just a picky person and I like things how I like them. So my stepdad started referring to me as the Princess, like \u201cdon\u2019t open the car window, the Princess will get upset\u201d. My stepbrothers and mum use it as well. It\u2019s a running family joke, well meant, I\u2019ve never been offended by it in the 15 years it\u2019s been a thing. My stepsister, Georgia (F30) hates it. She used to snap whenever anyone said it but over the years she just started making the odd passive aggressive comment about it. Everyone ignores it, because Georgia has a habit of thinking everything is about her, and if it's not about her, the reason it's not about her is because we all hate her, which then is still about her.\n\nSo, our whole family is visiting my parents in the countryside for a couple of weeks. Georgia has brought her boyfriend Jason along. I\u2019ve met Jason a couple of times before at dinners and he\u2019s a nice guy, and he\u2019s fit in well. \n\nThis morning, me and my mum were making breakfast and Jason came down and to help out. We normally have breakfast in the kitchen/diner so eventually everyone started gathering at the table. We always make the tea and coffee last so it\u2019s hot when we eat and we had all the mugs out and Jason offered to make the drinks. I told him not to do mine because I liked it made a very particular way, and he said \u201cokay Princess I will just watch how you do it so I know for next time\u201d and we laughed. It. Was. A. Joke. \n\nThe next thing we know, Georgia shouts she\u2019s sick of everyone calling me. She then swore at Jason for being \u201cjust like them (us)\u201d. She said since everyone thinks I\u2019m so special what does that make her, and I replied \u201cthe ugly stepsister, obviously\u201d. No one said anything, but Georgia burst into tears, pushed her plate onto the floor (broke it) and went upstairs, and Jason ran after her. He\u2019s since come down to apologise for her, she hasn\u2019t come out of her room. \n\nMy stepbrothers are on my side, the parents say I should have just not said anything and she would have calmed down, and that I went too far picking at an insecurity. That might be true, but I\u2019m sick of her making everything about her. The joke doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her, and I am (as are my stepbrothers) sick of her acting out to force everyone to behave how she wants them to. \n\nAm I the AH for taking the argument there?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

Why were you hogging all of the attention. Then, she reasoned  (for whatever reason, maybe she is unattractive), that she, must then, be the ugly stepsister. \n\nNot anyone's fault but her own.

I was odd man out in my family (I\u2019m an introvert, with lots of feelings, and my family is like OP\u2019s). I get it can feel uncomfortable. I adapted. Once I reached adulthood, we had to have some tough conversations. Georgia seems to have gotten bitter and let it fester, well into adulthood, instead of talking to her family or a therapist.", "I'm pretty sure Georgia just had a cPTSD meltdown after a life of neglect.", "She wasn\u2019t bullying her. She got tired of her bs. Y\u2019all call anything bullying.", "Well, the people with the nicknames don't care, which should be all that matters.", "That is an interesting question", "It\u2019s not her nickname to be bothered by. Everyone is on one accord, except the stepsister. She needs to express her feeling like an adult, or drop it.", "I really don\u2019t think that her liking her tea a certain way, not liking the window open in the car etc is really that problematic.", "How dare she be upset by everyone constantly bending to service the annoying one and treating her like she's royalty", "Right!!! Like OP is not getting how she is the one who comes off as the entitled golden child ugly stepsister trope. \n\nI half imagine they\u2019re going to a ball and OP\u2019s stepsister will come in with a bunch of mice and glass slippers to win the heart of the rich kindhearted bachelor and leave her BF who clearly is willing to betray her to her family behind.", "Thank fucking god, another person who recognizes that sometimes diagnosis don\u2019t actually help a situation, they just make it worse. Because the bottom line is you have to learn to cope with it regardless.", "I disagree", "Actually, jokes are rarely funny if they aren't at least a tiny bit mean. I guess this is 2023 though, no humor is allowed, and we must be considerate of every living person's feelings at all times to the detriment of literally everyone else in the world, science and truth included.", "As someone with sensory issues, OP sounds like a pain to be around", "I wouldnt want to have my bf call someone i dont like, a princess", "Because despite it being a derogatory joke, everyone in OP's life still prioritizes her needs which does kind of make the whole princess thing real.", "It's a straight up passive aggressive insult but OP doesnt care. She isn't having anyone else do the picky activity in this scenario (the pancakes) but it's the boyfriend that made the situation worse.", "Yeah that\u2019s why I think this is an ESH situation. Like literally everyone", "I believe maddiebay0396 was referring to the \"ugly stepsister\" remark. And yes, you do owe her an apology for that. \n\nAs has been pointed out many times on AITA, \"but it's just a joke\" is the rallying cry of bullies. If the recipient of the \"joke\" isn't laughing, it's not a joke after all.", "There is also the fact that maybe it is not that you are called princess, but it seems like your family is very sensitive to your issues (rightfully so, supportive family for the win), but that it inconveniences her or she has some issues that conflict with yours. I feel like there is a lot unsaid here.", "Except they cater to you due to the \"princess\" behavior, so it does impact her.", "So it's ok for you to be sensitive and picky in your family but when she's sensitive and has an issue, she needs to suck it up?", "You're an asshole seriously. Get help.", "You truly don\u2019t see the problem here\u2026.?", "In a family with two girls, only ONE being called \u201cPrincess\u201d deems the other one \u201cNOT a Princess.\u201d And what are we conditioned to think of the not-Princess as? The Ugly Stepsister. So, your step sister has had to grow up having her own father and brothers refer to her step sister as the princess.", "Read the comments and you will see the joke has everything to do with her, you just are too self centered to see it.", "[removed]", "So when you're sensitive everybody has to cater to you and dance around you, but when someone else is sensitive they should just suck it up? Really? And you still don't understand why YTA?", "I used the quotation marks for a reason, for lack of a better word. This isn't my first language.", "So glad I don't know you IRL. You're miserable. Lmao", "You\u2019re clearly ignoring the point. Your \u201cPrincess\u201d nickname is hurtful to your stepsister because she\u2019s clearly always felt less important than you. Why is that so hard for you to grasp?", "Maybe it \u2018should\u2019 be, but life doesn\u2019t always work that way.", "YTA\n\nSounds like your step sister is the real Cinderella here who, like Cinderella, is mistreated and ostracized by her family\u2026.which would make you\u2026", "Huh \"the people with the nicknames don't care\"... Have you ever stopped to wonder if maybe the one person with NO nickname might care about not having one? HER dad, HER brothers, and now HER boyfriend all call you by your funny little nickname and no one seems to be including her in the fun. It sounds like if you were to stop thinking about yourself for about 30 seconds you might be able to figure out why she seems to battle some deep seated insecurities and envy towards you. \n\nBut of course we can't expect you to think about someone else for half a minute now can we?", "Of course you don't mind the nickname \"princess\". A more fitting nickname would be the brat because that's what you actually act like.", "You do realize that being called a princess is not a good thing. Don't put the window down or princess will get upset. It just shows that every single person in your life has to bow down and cater to you. Otherwise you'll throw us full-blown temperature.\n\nIt literally seems like you expect the whole world to cater to you. Have you thought about going to seek some therapy because it really seems like you could do with it to deal with your issues, your step sister is probably fed up of having to bow down to everything you want It's time to put on your big girl pants. Grow up and stop name calling. That is just so embarrassing", "thanks for letting me know", "Hold on, my eyes rolled into the back of my head with your comment. \n\nHumor is allowed in 2023. You can tell jokes in 2023. You can tell mean jokes in 2023. \n\nBut sometimes, it makes you an asshole.", "Yes, that's the last straw... Good you mentioned it.\n\nIt is no longer an inside joke.\nWhen fiance or in -laws are involved in an inside joke which you already don't like,  that is the end card for  hope.", "Exactly!", "Ohhh. Didn't realise. Yeah, obviously I don't think that was funny, it wasn't meant to be funny. I didn't expect her throw her food on the floor, but I didn't expect her to laugh.", "This right here", "There's a difference between liking coffee a specific way, and causing a scene over a longtime family nickname over jealousy.", "Your comment has been removed because it violates rule 1: [Be Civil](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/about/rules/).

Maybe the word you were looking for is 'ridicule'?\n\nIn any case, I don't agree with that. If it bothered me, they wouldn't say it. It's not like it was something I hated and just got used to, I never minded, and if I had my stepdad wouldn't have said it. Me and my stepbrothers all have teasing nicknames for each other, which wouldn't have stuck if anyone was upset it.", "Yeah I can\u2019t help but notice that in that list it seems like the stepsister is the only one without a nickname.", "It's not, she just doesn't care.", "SensualWhisper is the guy that has \"fluent in sarcasm\" on his dating profile so women know that all his previous girlfriends dumped him for being an asshole.", "So you meant to hurt her. And now you\u2019re asking if you\u2019re the AH. Obviously you are.\n\nI think you secretly like the \u201cprincess\u201d nickname because it makes you feel special, and like the center of everyone\u2019s attention. Your posts and comments make you come across as someone who is used to getting their way and being catered to. To top it all off, you act like you\u2019re completely oblivious to that.\n\nYou know what you\u2019re doing and it\u2019s ugly behavior.", "So you meant to be cruel.and emotionally abusive?", "So you were being mean on purpose. \n\nLike, yeah, thats an asshole thing to do.", "Yeah, you didn't realize. You say Georgia has a habit of making things all about her, I think you're just noticing that sometimes things aren't all about *you* and interpret that as *other* people trying to steal attention. You're self-centered and can't even see it, and your family is jerks. I can't blame Georgia for the way she reacted, you all sound miserable.", "It you didnt make it to be funny, didnt expect her to find it funny, then thats a straight up insult.", "There's no world (besides your own) where you wouldn't be the ah.\n\nYTA and will likely be very lonely", "So you knew it was cruel and still are here trying to justify being intentionally cruel", "Have you tried to apologise yet? Or are you waiting for her to come out to see if she apoligises for her poor behaviour first? I know you said her boyfriend apoligised on her behalf but that's not really sincere. To me she asked and you answered, you were incredibley rude but it was an appropriate response and I can't thing of any other response other than evil stepsister, and I don't know which one is worse.", "You\u2019re a complete asshole, you\u2019re completely admitting to throwing a punch here not meant for her to laugh at, so obviously not a joke.", "So you did something spiteful on purpose and have the gall to ask if you\u2019re the AH?!?\n\nMaybe this princess needs a night in the gutter", "And you did it in front of her bf. Why?", "this just makes me think about how many times you have probably hurt your sister on purpose like this. this was so casually thrown out in front of everyone and shamelessly at that... behind closed doors you must be even more awful of a person. I would never knowingly say something so hurtful like this to anyone, let alone family no matter what the reason.   \n\n\nYou have an awful personality, cruel, and spiteful. And you are so blas\u00e9  \nabout it, feeling vindicated in your actions... that is the scary part. that is a sociopathic tendency you got there. You should see a therapist.", "Ugh I hate this argument. Just because some people aren\u2019t bothered by teasing doesn\u2019t give them the right to step on the boundaries of people who hate it. Don\u2019t call people ugly. \n\nAnd the golden child very rarely thinks of themself that way. Try to step back because she\u2019s probably got a point.", "Fine. Seems like Georgia is though. And the answer to the original AITA question is still yes.", "Of course it doesn't bother YOU. You act like a picky little princess, your parents cater to their picky little princess.", "Is \u201cridicule\u201d that much better? Sounds like you and your stepbrothers are thick as thieves and Georgia isn\u2019t part of the clique, for whatever the reasons. I imagine there\u2019s a lot more to those dynamics and how they play into getting you all to the point reached at that breakfast.\n\nSpecific to the question you are asking in this post, yes YTA", "Lol I kinda wanna know why you even bothered to ask. You\u2019ve made it quite clear that you don\u2019t actually care and that you know you\u2019re TA here. I\u2019m surprised Georgia didn\u2019t rock you for that one honestly. I would have", "OP literally said, \"it's never about her because we all hate her.\"", "She's certainly a smug little princess. It's rolling off of every comment she makes.", "This needs more upvotes, this is exactly what I\u2019m thinking", "Of course, OP is a princess, princesses get their own way no matter what and can treat people however they like.", "Sounds like it", "I think OP is the AH but that one remark is an interpretation of what the step sister is saying/thinking/feeling. It isn\u2019t a statement OP has claimed ownership of"]}
