{"id": 22484, "submission_id": "1524p9p", "title": "AITA for calling my stepsister the \"ugly stepsister\" because she freaked out over a nickname?", "selftext": "My (F29) family jokingly refers to me as \u201cPrincess/The Princess\u201d, because I have a reputation for being opinionated and sensitive. This is mostly because of sensory issues, so certain noises or textures grate on me to an extent that I will leave the room or avoid touching things. I\u2019m also just a picky person and I like things how I like them. So my stepdad started referring to me as the Princess, like \u201cdon\u2019t open the car window, the Princess will get upset\u201d. My stepbrothers and mum use it as well. It\u2019s a running family joke, well meant, I\u2019ve never been offended by it in the 15 years it\u2019s been a thing. My stepsister, Georgia (F30) hates it. She used to snap whenever anyone said it but over the years she just started making the odd passive aggressive comment about it. Everyone ignores it, because Georgia has a habit of thinking everything is about her, and if it's not about her, the reason it's not about her is because we all hate her, which then is still about her.\n\nSo, our whole family is visiting my parents in the countryside for a couple of weeks. Georgia has brought her boyfriend Jason along. I\u2019ve met Jason a couple of times before at dinners and he\u2019s a nice guy, and he\u2019s fit in well. \n\nThis morning, me and my mum were making breakfast and Jason came down and to help out. We normally have breakfast in the kitchen/diner so eventually everyone started gathering at the table. We always make the tea and coffee last so it\u2019s hot when we eat and we had all the mugs out and Jason offered to make the drinks. I told him not to do mine because I liked it made a very particular way, and he said \u201cokay Princess I will just watch how you do it so I know for next time\u201d and we laughed. It. Was. A. Joke. \n\nThe next thing we know, Georgia shouts she\u2019s sick of everyone calling me. She then swore at Jason for being \u201cjust like them (us)\u201d. She said since everyone thinks I\u2019m so special what does that make her, and I replied \u201cthe ugly stepsister, obviously\u201d. No one said anything, but Georgia burst into tears, pushed her plate onto the floor (broke it) and went upstairs, and Jason ran after her. He\u2019s since come down to apologise for her, she hasn\u2019t come out of her room. \n\nMy stepbrothers are on my side, the parents say I should have just not said anything and she would have calmed down, and that I went too far picking at an insecurity. That might be true, but I\u2019m sick of her making everything about her. The joke doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her, and I am (as are my stepbrothers) sick of her acting out to force everyone to behave how she wants them to. \n\nAm I the AH for taking the argument there?", "created_utc": 1689606779, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1524p9p/aita_for_calling_my_stepsister_the_ugly/", "score": 3663, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

You paint her as self-centered, but I\u2019d bet that she has felt subordinate to you her whole life, and is trying to claw back some of that attention for herself.\n\nAs \u2018Princess\u2019, your very particular needs and wants probably grate on the people around you to some extent. They have probably spent their lives catering to your picky personality, and under that friendly family joke lies a bit of real resentment. To be blunt, YOU are the center of attention, and YOU have become accustomed to it. \n\nThe way to fix this is to apologize to your sister, try and have a dialogue with her about this, and try to be a bit less particular in your own wants when it puts an extra burden on those around you.\n\nYOUR COMFORT IS NOT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THOSE AROUND YOU.\n\nYTA", "YTA. Being overly picky doesn't make you special or give you the right to call someone else ugly. Apologize and mean it.", "YTA. It sounds like your stepsister is constantly feeling ignore because your the princess of the family and I get it based on everything you said. It seems like you always get your way because you are picky and sensitive. And then to insult her afterwards is just way too far. It also seems like everything is about you as you are the \"princess\" as they refer to you.", "YTA. You called her ugly. But your story really paints you as the ugly stepsister- opinionated, sensitive and calling people names.", "Info:\n\nHas anyone asked why you sarcastically being called \"Princess\" bothers her? \n\nWas it a pet name used for her by her dad, and then your step dad started calling you that instead? Has she always felt in competition of you?", "YTA and people calling you princess are TA too. Even though you're not offended, it doesn't sound like a term of endearment (or something) when being used the way you describe. I might be wrong, but to me it sounds belittling. Anyway definitely yta for the ugly stepsister comment. As an actual non-attractive (ugly) person I can vouch that even as a \"joke\" that would feel horrible to hear.", "YTA. \n\nThis is one of those where I would really love your stepsister\u2019s side of the story. It sounds like you were attended to by both your parents and her brothers while she was not included much in any of those dynamics. If she feels like you were spoiled and coddled, \u201cPrincess\u201d kinda reinforces that your family readily attended to you. It\u2019s hard to tell if you\u2019re the golden child and she\u2019s reacting to that, or if she\u2019s too sensitive.\n\nEither way, calling her the ugly stepsister was super unnecessary. Her boyfriend apologizing for her also gives me the ick. She\u2019s allowed to be upset by you saying something hurtful.", "YTA. What you said makes YOU the ugliest stepsister.", "ESH.

Being not offended when someone refers to you as \u2018princess\u2019 is not the same thing as not taking offense when someone calls you an \u2018ugly stepsister\u2019. You know she hates the princess thing, obvs, and it\u2019s pretty clear that it\u2019s bc she\u2019s jealous. Now she has to listen to her *boyfriend* also call you Princess and hear you insult her? What a family. You know what you could have said when she asked what she was? \u2018Another Princess, since we\u2019re sisters, silly\u2019", "YTA\n\n\nI don't believe that you don't understand why she is bothered by everyone in her family including her boyfriend calling you princess. It may have started because you are picky or whatever, but the word princess comes with being beautiful, special, royal, etc\n\nAnd for however many years everyone has called you that excluding her.\n\nJust for that your family are mayor assholes. \n\nAnd then the boyfriend says it too. Another asshole.\n\nBut you, not only disregarded her feelings all this years,  you obviously thrive on being the special girl of the family, but intentionally embarrassed her in front of her boyfriend.  YTA and a pick me, and honestly is really pathetic at your age", "YTA. Such a mean girls moment.", "YTA. You say she always makes everything about her, but it sounds like it\u2019s always about you. Princess this, princess that, sounds a bit self centered, no?", "\"It's because we all hate her.\"\n\nIf your parents have confirmed this, then it's you and them that are the problem.", "YTA. Calling your sister like that makes you the ugly stepsister honestly. Her bf also sucks... When is clear there is resentment about a joke that she is been ranting about for a while, and being ignored. But it shows you nor your family care at all about how this joke makes her feel and to top it you called her ugly. Mean and AH.", "ESH.\n\nI'm confused as to why you accuse someone of making \"everything about her,\" when you're the one in charge as Princess of the castle. \n\nAnd you think the \"princess\" nickname is well-meant? It is a coping mechanism to help everyone around you deal with your pickiness. They're laughing at you so they don't get irritated every time you dictate your preferences.\n\nYou seem to think \"princess\" is a literal description of your role within the family.\n\nGeorgia is the only one not playing along here. Crazy.", "YTA, that comment wasn\u2019t necessary. You picked at an insecurity and hit home hard meanwhile your nickname really has no bad meaning or association tied to it. She probably feels insignificant to you, and you just doubled down on making her feel lesser.", "YTA. You could have gone with invisible, ignored, former, forgotten, OG princess, you didn't have to say \"ugly\" while flirting with her boyfriend. \n\nClearly after the merged family, she felt replaced as the only girl by a high maintenance person who now gets all the attention.", "YTA.

You weren't an asshole up until you called her ugly. I mean come on, obviously that's over the line regardless of how weird and annoying she's being.\n\nEven if she deserved it, even if it's true, you're still an asshole for saying it.\n\nYou should apologize to her, but make it part of a bigger conversation.\n\nMaybe start with \"of course I don't think you're ugly, I was just leaning into the trope because you keep making it into such a big deal. I'm sorry I said that, it was out of line. Can we talk about why you flip out over something that is obviously just a good natured running joke?\"", "YTA! Why would you refer to anyone as ugly, period? You said you're sensitive also, but your stepsister isn't afforded the same understanding for also being sensitive. She's allowed to be tired of everyone referring to you as a princess. While it may be a joke, did you not listen to her feeling of what does that make her? Her own father (allegedly) doesn't see his biological daughter as his princess, yet you think she's overreacting and makes everything about her. Seems to me, here, from reading this, you don't like it when it's not all about you. Perhaps you both are a reflection of one another. Either way, YTA here, you owe her an apology.", "YTA re-read the post EVERYTHING is about you.", "YTA and incredibly entitled.   You actually came here to ask and obviously were certain everyone would agree with you because you won't even accept judgements.   The entire post just reeks of being self centered and relishing being able to dictate how things are.    You read like a villainess from a Disney movie.", "YTA.  You sound insufferable and that everything is about you.  Maybe you displaced her as princess. This princess thing isn\u2019t cute or really complimentary.  It\u2019s not doing you any good.", "YTA. I find it funny that you say that everything revolves around her, when it sounds more like everything revolves around you and your pickiness. And while she did overreact, this is likely just the straw that broke the camels back and calling her the ugly step sister made it so much worse. She probably has felt consistently less important than you.", "You're too hard on her. An apology is appropriate and kind, no matter how much you don't want to.", "YTA - I\u2019m also betting she doesn\u2019t have a cute nickname. So you messed up big time - I mean I\u2019m sure she doesn\u2019t throw a fit when things have to be done your way and your way only. I bet she had to walk on eggshells bc your family always catered to your needs (I\u2019m gonna assume you have seen a doctor and have been diagnosed with sensory processing issues and these aren\u2019t your wants for). She has gone at half her life making sure your needs and let\u2019s face it I\u2019m sure many of the things are your preferences and aren\u2019t needs. For example, having a cup of tea that isn\u2019t burn your mouth is a preference but not eating mushy food may be a sensory need. Apologize and get some empathy", "YTA and it sounds like you\u2019re the self-centered one.", "YTA", "YTA. You got big Pick Me energy. Yuck.", "ESH. She's an idiot, but she was being annoying, not hurtful; you actually hurt her feelings intentionally. Not cool.", "ESH? \n\nThem for picking on you...for 15 years?\n\nYou for apparently being okay with your bullies?\n\nThe bf for falling in line with being a bully \n\nYour step sister for not realizing your family is a bunch of bullies.\n\nBut here's the thing....at some point (that your sister recognized) it changed from bullying to actual affection. She stopped defending you because she saw the switch. It's clear you don't like her. I wonder what your mom thinks of her... she now thinks that you all have a code running joke that you are the actual princess/golden child, you've even got her bf in on it, and she's sick of it.", "I believe you already know the answer, you just don\u2019t want to admit it\u2026 YTA", "The kind thing to say would have been \u201ca princess\u2019s sister is also a princess\u201d.", "YTA.\n\nYeah. Her behaviour is beyond the pale, but you don't lower yourself to that level. It was just unnecessary and you admitted you targeted an insecurity.\n\nI'd apologise for what I said, but clarify why I said it.", "YTA, you have been picky, selfish and spoiled for years and your family started calling you princess because you have been acting like an entitled, spoiled princess for years.  You seem to enjoy being called princess because it means you can keep acting like a spoiled, entitled princess and it makes you think your behavior is okay, when really your family has been just calling you that because that's the only way to deal with you. \n\n\nThen even your step sisters boyfriend started catering to your princess demands and she justifiably lost it after 14 years of dealing with your BS. And your response was just to call her names rather than being a nearly 30 year old woman who had never understood that being called \"princess\" due to being demanding and controlling is a bad thing.", "ESH. Your sensory issues are valid and the joke isn't so bad since you like it. But, it gives me pick me vibes that a grown ass 30 year old still likes to being called a fucking princess. Honestly, her extreme reaction makes me think that you were the golden child but that's not why you are the asshole. She was an asshole overall for her behavior but your answer was so tasteless and low that you were way worse, Princess.", "I\u2019m torn, I\u2019m tempted to write ESH, your step sister needs to grow up, but you shouldn\u2019t have said what you said. She\u2019s obviously sensitive and there\u2019s something going on there. She might be struggling with things u don\u2019t know of and her BF saying that nickname was the last straw. And if the nickname was Cinderella it would have made sense in a Joke scenario BUT instead u just came off as a bit of a dick :( she should have also talked to her boyfriend and warned him that it\u2019s sensitive to her", "Bro, yall are grown ass adults and are acting like this? \n\nShould she have blown up, no, but that honestly seems like years of repressed emotions. Should you have called her the ugly stepsister, no, but i get the knee-jerk defensiveness.\n\nBoth of you need to sit down and have a productive conversation if you want to have a healthy relationship with one another.", "YTA.  You're bragging about being high maintenance, and saying everyone hates your sister.  I'd say that makes you and your whole personality ugly and entitled.", "ESH\n\nYes yta for saying that, but her issue over a nickname that isn\u2019t about her is a problem.  To many being called \u201cthe princess\u201d in the context you cite would be an insult.  But you have a compatible sense of humor so it works great and you all, except her, are fine with it\n\nIf she had an issue because she read it as insulting and was defending you be one thing-though would still need to get over it as YOU were ok.\n\nBasically it reads she\u2019s jealous or feeling unloved as isn\u2019t getting same attention.  That may be a family \u201cgolden one\u201d issue, or it may be things she\u2019s caused.  Hard to say, but doesn\u2019t make her outburst or your response ok", "YTA - I have a sibling that I jokingly used to call princess as well because it\u2019s EXHAUSTING dealing with people who expect everyone to constantly cater to them. Newsflash, you\u2019re not offended because your family would seemingly rather give in and let you get your way than deal with whatever tantrums you might throw when you don\u2019t. \n\nSounds like this started when you were 15ish and instead of maturing and growing up, you embraced it. Your stepsister on the other hand is probably rightfully over you being favorited and getting your way.", "Yta.", "YTA", "ESH - you could have gone with anything non-looks related & I\u2019d have said the step-sister was 100% wrong.

Definitely.", "ESH\n\nNormally calling someone ugly would be Y T A, but a 15 year old self-esteem issue that bursts out because her BF called you a nickname ... yeah, your sister is also to blame, but also may need therapy.", "YTA. Like someone else said, you could\u2019ve replied with anything else besides the \u201cugly stepsister.\u201d I\u2019m guessing you were making a reference to Cinderella and her mean, self-absorbed stepsisters. Was it witty? Yes. Was it necessary to say that in front of her boyfriend? No. It was very mean-spirited, especially after the whole interaction with you and her boyfriend that clearly made her feel uncomfortable.

After all, you did embarrass her publicly so you should apologize publicly.", "yikes huge yta", "I really feel like I missed something or something was edited before I got here. I can maybe see ESH for the name-calling, but no one is a bigger AH in this scenario than the one who can't handle your nickname. You're 29 and she's 30. Who cares what your family calls you?

Wow. YTA", "YTA and sound insufferable", "Even if you're entirely right about everything else and your sister is too sensitive/overreacting (I say if because it's hard to know from your perspective if you were actually the golden child and she's upset for a reason), YTA for that response. That was mean and petty, and surely you knew she would get even more upset. So even if you thought she was being childish, why drop to that level too and make a mean joke that picks at her sore spot? Try to be the bigger person next time.", "Sounds like some good old fashion sibling bickering to me. I thought your joke was pretty funny and just about anyone with thicker-than-paper skin would probably laugh about it too.

At some point you give up walking on eggshells around then because why should you have to live you life like that but it\u2019s still problematic.", "YTA, it\u2019s not the nickname so much as it is the way you treat your step sis. I imagine there is a huge difference on how everyone treated her. What you did was cruel and in front on her boyfriend. That was a pick me moment you can be better. It\u2019s one thing to be funny it\u2019s another to suggest your step sis was inferior. Personally I always thought of princess as an insult. I would never let people call me that.", "ESH\n\nYou\u2019re both grown adults. The way that both you and your sister are acting is wild to me. Grow up.

I had to double check your age when I read this. You sound like a 16y/o girl who thrives on attention, not a 29 y/o woman.

Calling her the ugly step sister knowing she has insecurities is cruel and you know it. I can understand why step sister wasn't happy her boyfriend joined in on the joke. Don't you say the family hates her in the post? Yeah that's nasty and I can see why step sister is irritated by family doing things ur way because you are not flexible. Apologise to her.

And your comments cement how selfish you are.", "You're 29 years old, please get over yourself OP.", "YTA and she\u2019s also probably annoyed because you are literally the princess of the family and I find it funny you say she gets mad when everything isn\u2019t about her, but you literally sound like you can\u2019t deal with not everything being about you. It sounds like stepsister is constantly pushed to the side for you because you\u2019re the princess of the family. I can\u2019t lie if my boyfriend called someone princess I\u2019d also be annoyed about it. You called her ugly because you want to be the pretty princess with all the attention so you put her down.

Its making a joke of your very well known(to your fam) \"quirk \" or sensory issues (im unclear, my apologies, sensory issues make you all the more NTA) that some might consider a flaw- having a particular way of making tea- oh theyre uptight! What a princess! And you took that well because it was honest to you, instead of letting it hurt you (which, idk why but good for you!). But that doesn't mean it's a good connotation, your stepsister doesn't get it but she is being The Princess.", "YTA obviously. I think you still don't get that calling you princess, while it sounds funny to you, it's not for them. It's not a compliment. You sound insufferable.", "So at age 15 (an age where people are famous for thinking rationally) a young girl went from being her dad\u2019s only daughter to suddenly having a stepsister 1 year younger than her that he started calling a princess. I\u2019m guessing that to Georgia, this seemed like you became her dad\u2019s favourite daughter, which made her resent the nickname. The whole family picked up on the nickname and whenever she expressed that she doesn\u2019t like it you used that as justification for believing she thinks everything is about her. \n\nYour stepdad and Georgia should have sat down and had a proper conversation about this a long time ago, and you should have learnt to be less opinionated and sensitive a long time ago too. You\u2019re the one who\u2019s actually made everything about you, and Georgia is understandably fed up with it. \n\nWhen even Georgia\u2019s boyfriend picked up on it and started calling you princess (sometimes seen as an affectionate nickname between partners) she snapped, and in response you insulted her. Almost guaranteed she\u2019d been thinking of herself as the ugly stepsister for a long time, she didn\u2019t need you confirming it for her. \n\nNow, is Georgias response to a nickname logical or fair, no, and does she kinda suck for turning something small at face value into such a big issue, yes.

The way you want it, is the way things are.\n\nNo doubt your stepsister feels like she got short-changed in her family. a LOT of new step-parents bend over backwards to play nice with the new stepkids and this may have happened here, where your SD over-did his fussing over you to impress your mother.\n\nHope your Stepsister goes to therapy to undo the harm your family cause to her. You won't ever see it because you were never neglected or cast aside. \n\nSo YTA but your mind may not be able to comprehend it without therapy yourself to see how awful her life was.", "I think you are an ass whose personality has probably been a lot more irksome than you really have addressed.

This is mostly because of sensory issues, so certain noises or textures grate on me to an extent that I will leave the room or avoid touching things. I\u2019m also just a picky person and I like things how I like them. So my stepdad started referring to me as the Princess, like \u201cdon\u2019t open the car window, the Princess will get upset\u201d. My stepbrothers and mum use it as well. It\u2019s a running family joke, well meant, I\u2019ve never been offended by it in the 15 years it\u2019s been a thing. My stepsister, Georgia (F30) hates it. She used to snap whenever anyone said it but over the years she just started making the odd passive aggressive comment about it. Everyone ignores it, because Georgia has a habit of thinking everything is about her, and if it's not about her, the reason it's not about her is because we all hate her, which then is still about her.\n\nSo, our whole family is visiting my parents in the countryside for a couple of weeks. Georgia has brought her boyfriend Jason along. I\u2019ve met Jason a couple of times before at dinners and he\u2019s a nice guy, and he\u2019s fit in well. \n\nThis morning, me and my mum were making breakfast and Jason came down and to help out. We normally have breakfast in the kitchen/diner so eventually everyone started gathering at the table. We always make the tea and coffee last so it\u2019s hot when we eat and we had all the mugs out and Jason offered to make the drinks. I told him not to do mine because I liked it made a very particular way, and he said \u201cokay Princess I will just watch how you do it so I know for next time\u201d and we laughed. It. Was. A. Joke. \n\nThe next thing we know, Georgia shouts she\u2019s sick of everyone calling me. She then swore at Jason for being \u201cjust like them (us)\u201d. She said since everyone thinks I\u2019m so special what does that make her, and I replied \u201cthe ugly stepsister, obviously\u201d. No one said anything, but Georgia burst into tears, pushed her plate onto the floor (broke it) and went upstairs, and Jason ran after her. He\u2019s since come down to apologise for her, she hasn\u2019t come out of her room. \n\nMy stepbrothers are on my side, the parents say I should have just not said anything and she would have calmed down, and that I went too far picking at an insecurity. That might be true, but I\u2019m sick of her making everything about her. The joke doesn\u2019t have anything to do with her, and I am (as are my stepbrothers) sick of her acting out to force everyone to behave how she wants them to. \n\nAm I the AH for taking the argument there?\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

SS, wanted everyone to say she was \"ugly\" because she had been internalizing all of the good natured jabbing as an insult to her. She wasn't given a \"cute\" nickname. Why were you hogging all of the attention. Then, she reasoned  (for whatever reason, maybe she is unattractive), that she, must then, be the ugly stepsister. \n\nNot anyone's fault but her own.

I suspect Georgia is furious that she never got to be \u201cPrincess\u201d or was replaced by someone who had more immediately obvious needs; she was thinking her bf would be the one person who treats her as the princess she wants to be and lost it when her expectations weren\u2019t met in favor of OP. \u201cUgly stepsister\u201d is right - not because of her looks but because she\u2019s tantrumjng out her bitterness and anger instead of trying to communicate like an adult.

But I all him not to open the windows when he drives because it causes me physical pain. That could get called \"princess\" in some situations. It really depends on her reactions and how she earned the princess name. It's it really just sensitivities that's she's asking people to accommodate or is she freaking out about it?

She made it not just about her nickname but brought her stepsisters looks and personality into the equation. \n\nI just kind of find it mean spirited and I\u2019m really not getting the joke. \n\nSo maybe Op does have sensory issues that could be diagnosed. Maybe they\u2019re just picky. But either way she didn\u2019t have to make the comment to her sister so vicious.

As a person with ADHD and late diagnosis autism, my terrible father would literally sneer and call me Princess as well. For stuff I couldn\u2019t control - like not being able to sleep at night with certain sounds in my room. OP writes as if she understands Princess isn\u2019t a compliment but a joke at her expense, if one maybe not meant harmfully. She shouldn\u2019t have called her stepsister ugly - but I think the negative light everybody is quick to cast is absurd.

I'm not forcing anyone to cater to my needs, like some folks are implying OP is.

It's not that much of a stretch to think that someone with that nickname is an entitled, spoiled brat. But per OP, she has sensory issues and also happens to be opinionated, so this seems to me less \"We call her Princess because she's our beautiful Princess and we give her what she wants all the time\" and more \"We ironically call her Princess because she likes things the way she likes\" \n\nOP mentions three things about her.\n\n-One, she says that when exposed to her triggers, she removes herself from the situation. Doesn't mention making others leave the space.\n\n-Two, she doesn't drink tea/coffee unless it's made the way she likes, so she makes it herself. This tells me she's aware that her requirements are too much and likes to handle them herself. \n\n-Three, the window thing. I said in another comment that my mom was also sensitive and when sitting in the backseat, she didn't like to have the front seat window to be down. We all knew this and kept our windows up, but sometimes someone forgot and said \"Gotta put it up again, [Mom] doesn't like it down\". This could be just a case of common courtesy \n\nOf course, we are working with what's on the post, written to make OP look better. She could be a total entitled and spoiled brat, but working with what we've got, these are my conclusions.\n\nJason wanted to fit in. He saw that everyone calls OP \"Princess\" and thought that calling her that would make him fit in easier. He didn't realise that his girlfriend didn't like that and made a mistake that is in no way OPs fault. \n\nWhat makes OP an asshole is her comment. She knows how her sister feels about the whole thing; regardless of whether OP is actually an entitled brat or the sister is over sensitive and making a mountain out of a molehill, her sister doesn't like OP being called Princess and was predictably and understandably angry when her own boyfriend used the nickname. Knowing this, OP decided to call her \"the ugly sister\".", "Yup, not enough context to make a formal assessment.

No.  You give in to make the pain go away.\n\nI stopped reading because to continue to read is probably gonna lead to an excuse and the excuse is a trap.\n\nYou know the worst type of princess?

I don't get why everyone is jumping to such extreme conclusions over this post. The one concrete example we have of OP's pickiness is also an example of OP *clearly* taking responsibility for accommodating her own needs, and getting mocked for it anyway. I frankly think it's insane that OP was literally creating less work for Jason and he still felt the need to insult her.
