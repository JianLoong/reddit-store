This dude is a certified liar, he lies to his wife, he lies to his kids. He is trash. I would also say \"how do you know he hasn't lied to you? Do you think his wife would say the same thing? his kids?\"\n\nNot really your place to be aggressively against it though. Making your feelings known to your sister is one thing, but you have to let her live her life. Be civil with him if he's being civil with you, but you don't have to lie and tell him you respect him or think he's good for your sister if anyone asks you.\n\nYelling is usually embarrassing though. In the words of one of the Broad City women, \"who yells?\"", "NTA. Your sister was the side piece which is messed up, and why would she think he would be faithful to her exactly? I wouldn't be able to hold my tongue or accept him, either.", "NTA. My view so far is you can have a relationship with your sister and not have to meet him. It's a reasonable boundary to have I think. If she's dead set on having him come around, you need to reinforce that you're not interested in meeting him and never will be. My only question is if your sister is pushing the idea of meeting?.", "NTA...yet. If you blow up on him YTA. Does your sister really think she was or is the only side piece this guy has? Don't worry as he will never meet you or your family. You are right he is a coward.", "You can hate cheaters, but you have accept that your sister has made her choice. Either you accept it and move on, or take a break from her. Please think long and hard about this being a hill to die on.", "INFO:  Are you willing to completely nuke your relationship with your sister over this?  Because if you don't get your feelings of anger under control, that's exactly what will happen.", "You would be the AH if you flipped your shit on him. I think your feelings are valid but what exactly do you think doing that will accomplish? Both he and your sister know full well what they are doing, stop reminding her, and everyone is right, this is NOT your business. \n\nIf she is your best friend, accept this and agree to disagree, maybe talk to her about setting up a boundary(ie, neither of you talk about him or you never meet him, something like that) DON\u2019t drop the nuke, the only thing that will happen is the destruction of your relationship with your sister. \n\nFeel how you wanna feel, hate him if you wish, but tread carefully on how your actions will affect your sister.", "NTA, but I am going to give you a bit of a warning here. Your feelings of anger and dislike are yours and are neither good or bad. If you however act on those feelings with this man or push your sister to much you will permanently damage your relationship with your sister.

As it stands, NAH. \n\nUnfortunately, everyone involved is an adult and there is no real control you have over it. You have to decide whether a relationship with your sister is worth more than your feelings about the guy. If he does turn out to betray her in future, she will need you and her family around. It might be frustrating, but some people are stubborn and only learn that fire is hot when it burns them.", "Both NTA and YTA.\nnta for your feelings on the mockery of a relationship,  you don't have to accept him, ignore his existence completely if you want, that's your choice. \nYTA for the verbal attack you want to give him, just ignore him", "Ish \n\nSo, the question Is: IF you flip and you lose your sister, and IF the relationship fall apart, Who can help YOUR sister?\n\nShut up, so if you are wrong and the relationship work, it's ok, and if It didn't work...well...you are where you can help.", "NTA but if your going to take this stand, your sister has been knowingly sleeping with a married man for years, she is no saint. Your anger should be directed at both of them for their disgusting behavior", "NTA for feeling the way you feel, but YMBTA if you get in the way of a potentially \u2018good\u2019 thing that your sister might have. Right or wrong, it doesn\u2019t really affect your life other than the ways that you allow it to. Your opinion on the guy are valid & true to how you feel. But the ways your sister feels toward him are also valid. Soft YTA for putting yourself on a moral high ground. \n\nYou\u2019ve also already spoken negative and you\u2019ve made a final decision on the way that this relationship will end - which cannot be decided yet. You may be correct\u2014 but you might also be incorrect. You\u2019ll probably be happier if you realised that not everything your mind believes is true & that this doesn\u2019t have that much to do with you. Let it go & let your sister (who is a grown woman) make her own decision and deal with the (potential) consequences of her own actions", "NTA, but you\u2019re only hurting yourself by letting this live rent free in your brain. Tell your sister you love her but cannot support her relationship. You can\u2019t control her or your family\u2019s reaction to the relationship, but you can be true to yourself by just ignoring him.", "You hate the man and that is completely understandable but what about your sister? Im Not saying you should hate her or anything but she isn\u2019t a good person either and personally i wouldn\u2019t want to be around with people who doesn\u2019t care about anyone else but themselves.", "N T A for feeling this way but YTA for saying that to your sister. She's a grown adult and knows what she's getting into. Chances are you'll never have to meet him anyway so just keep your mouth closed. It's not worth losing your sister over.", "YTA, they are adults, it is not your business. You have never met him and hate him, she loves him, who do you think is gonna win. Grow up and get over it.", "My husband's family is in a similar situation. I'M voting NAH except for the boyfriend. \nYour sister is an adult and can make her own decisions to who she wants to date and you have a right to not like her boyfriend and how the relationship came to be. With that said, is it really not possible for you to control yourself around him if you guys will eventually do meet when she brings him for dinner or something? Here is what we do for my situation which idk if it'll fit for yours. BILs gf cheated on him with her ex boyfriend( she cheated on the ex bf with my BIL). We didn't like her because of how the relationship came to be but gave her a chance to see how she treats BIL. As I said before, she cheated on him and ended the relationship for the ex. Now she's cheating again on her ex with my BIL. At this point we absolutely do not support their relationship and when he brought her over so she can say hi to the family, everyone just ignored her mostly. If she tried talking it was just one word answers or no attempt to hold the conversation. Cheating wasn't the only thing we hate about her but instead of calling her out we just didn't say anything at all. It was awkward, not gonna lie. \nNow, this didn't cause relationship issues between the family BUT can't say it'll be the same outcome. It's like the saying, if you got nothing nice to say then don't say anything at all.", "YTA....it is Zero business of yours ...NONE....", "YTA. Your sister is a grown ass adult and gets to make her own decisions. You don't get a say unless she asks for your opinion, and even in that case you should be tactful. You're causing a rift for no good reason and trying to control your sister by threatening her. Get over yourself and stay out of her business.", "YTA. You've said what you needed to say already.   At this point you just need to be there for your sister.   It's really not your business.   He's been honest with your sister the whole time and she seems happy with the situation.   Be happy for her happiness and be there if she ends up sad, like a good sister should.", "NTA\nTell her to her face \"I love you and I will be here for you when this guy ends up cheating on you, but I won't act how you want me to\" then block her.", "YTA. INFO: are you the one he was married to? I ask because you\u2019re taking your FORTY year old sisters relationship wayyy too personally. Neither of them have wronged you in any way and you\u2019ve never even met the guy and you\u2019re already on Reddit asking whether you should throw away your relationship with your SISTER or not. Get a grip and back off of your sister. She\u2019s old enough to figure her own love life out.", "YTA. Your sister\u2019s relationship is not your business. You are not in their shoes.
