I live in the Midwest which is where this has taken place. \n\n\rLast year a local family friendly brewery announced they would no longer be as family friendly. In the past, parents could go and eat and have a drink while the kids played outside. Enough Patrons complained about the kids and dogs being off the leash that the business changed their practices. Weekends were for 21+ only and no animals allowed. The blow back online was large, but the crowd who were for this were even louder, so I assumed they would be alright. \n\n\rI only noticed this because I own the land next to them and follow their page. My friend was a brewer already and I specialize in children\u2019s playground equipment, so after a conversation and noticing the opportunity, we took the necessary steps to open a family friendly brewery with a dog park.  \n\n\rParents eat and have a drink while their kids play in our area, and pet owners have a open space too. At times the pet owners can have a seat while kids provide fun and entertainment for the pets by playing fetch and just being kids. \n\n\rTo say we have found a lot of success would be an understatement. Parents, kids, grandparents, and tag-a- longs keep us busy practically all day. We will likely have to expand this Summer. \n\n\rThe issue is the neighboring brewery is not doing well at all. They have had to downsize, and it is looking more and more like they will have to close the doors. I have spoken to someone who knows a bit about the business, and he claimed they alienated to much of their reliable clients and have been unable to win them back. \n\n\rI have gotten a few angry emails from patrons about this as this brewery is the only one in the area where people can go that isn\u2019t a bar or club. People have said some pretty nasty things about me and my business partner, and at times I feel they have a point. \n\n\rWas I wrong to open next to them and take advantage of the situation?", "created_utc": 1685460025, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vt5b8/aita_for_opening_up_a_family_friendly_brewery/", "score": 201, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They decided to cut off their clientele, and you found a niche to fill. What you should do is buy the neighboring brewery and have a 21+ section and a family friendly section (if the rent/overhead isn't too much).", "Questions of AH vs non AH rise to a whole different level when you are talking about business.  For example, AH behavior would be falsely swatting them, posting fake reviews, suing them with no basis just to drain their funds, naming your bar something similar enough to be confused, etc.  \n\nBut opening a business to serve a group that they chose to abandon?  Just common sense.  Unless the neighbors were the ones complaining about kids and pets unsupervised in their yards, tNTA.", "NTA: They made a bad business call and created a void in the local landscape for a family-friendly brewery. You simply filled in that missing place. They fucked themselves over. If it weren't you, it would have been someone else. The need was there, clearly. You aren't responsible for someone else's bad business decision.", "NTA.  The customers have spoken.  Not OP's fault the place next door chose a business model that wasn't able to keep them open.  Guess all those loud people who complained weren't a significant enough portion of the customer base to cater the business to.", "NTA\n\nThe customers who are making your business successful are the exact customers that this business *didn't* want and specifically prohibited from the premises. If they weren't going to your brewery they'd still be going somewhere else and the 21+ place would still be struggling.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like most people like your kid and dog friendly brewpub, and not many people like their adult-only offering.\n\nYour neighbor may offer the only adult-only facility in the area that isn't a bar or club, and he may have a small number of vocal customers who want that, but there don't seem to be many of them - not nearly enough people to keep him in business.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t live in the Midwest. I live in a small city on the beach was a crazy amount of local businesses. I could be wrong when I say this, but I\u2019m ignorant until I learn lol. \n\nIn my city there\u2019s so many local businesses all next to each other and all doing pretty well minus a couple that don\u2019t make it sometimes. There\u2019s like 6 bars next to each other downtown- they all do well because they all offer their own unique experience. But when things change in a business that drastically, it\u2019s high risk. It can be high reward, but you need to be smart about it (which they weren\u2019t, considering you live in the Midwest and it seems like there\u2019s more families than partying scenes). We\u2019ve had some bars change over time, but they do it slowly so as not to scare away regular customers. After all, regular customers are the bread and butter. \n\nThey made a risky business move and alienated customers. You wanted to create a business and did it in a smart way that didn\u2019t cost you too much it sounds like. If they were as awesome as they used to be, people would probably frequent both when they went (like a mini bar hop). \n\nKudos on the booming business!

How I wish this place was near us. It sounds amazing.\n\nNice work tapping into your market needs!", "NTA They made their choices. They decided to cater to the angry patrons who wanted things to be a certain way. Your brewery just as easily could have failed. Their place probably would have been in trouble anyway. It\u2019s not like the families would be going to their brewery if yours hadn\u2019t opened. Good luck going forward!", "NTA - if they were still there and you were directly competing for the exact same clientele, there might be some fuzziness, but they vacated that role and you picked it up.

Keep enjoying your success with the community you've been able to re-establish there. NTA.", "NTA. We have both a neighborhood bar and brewery; they get along swimmingly. They both suit different demographics but instead of competing against each other, they learned to coexist and promote each other. The bar proudly has one or two of the brewery's IPAs on tap and if you order food from the bar while at the brewery, you get a discount. \n\nNope. The brewery cut off their nose to spite their face. Not your fault that their business decision came back to bite them on the ass, and that their patrons who supported them are no where to be seen.", "NTA - They FAFO. They decided to listen to what was most likely a small but very vocal aspect of their customers and lost the majority of their main customers. You looked at the market and realized you could provide a service that people wanted. Do not listen to the nasty things, as they are upset that they miscalculated, and the patrons who liked it because it's not a bar or club, are probably the ones who complained about the kids and dogs, so they only have themselves to blame.", "Nta.  The bar didn\u2019t want to be family and pet friendly anymore, they would have lost that business whether you opened up or not.  That\u2019s kind of how it goes when you alienate half your clients.  \nWhat made them successful was that there were no other options for brewery\u2019s where you can bring your pets and kids, now they are just like every other bar, and they are competing with every other bar for business.  They really should have thought that out before catering to their whiney regulars and tanking their business to make them happy.", "NTA, it's just business, they shouldn't have made the decisions they made and they're trying to blame you for something that isn't your fault to make themselves feel better about their failing business. It's not like you stole their clients, they literally kicked them out, and then acted all confused that people stopped coming.", "NTA. You gave the people what they needed.", "NAH business is business. You made a business decision and so did the neighboring brewery. It could be in addition to the playground etc, your beer and food is better or you have friendlier service. They can just as easily improve something to attract 21+ customers as you can improve something to attract families. Restaurant business is competitive, you have to stay on your toes to keep your customers loyal.", ">I have gotten a few angry emails from patrons about this\n\nI don't understand this part. Customers of the 21+ brewery are sending you angry emails because you opened a family friendly brewery next to them and thus families aren't going to that place anymore which will lead them to close the place ?\n\nIs that right ?", "NTA they made a decision and you made one. That's how life is", "Establishments with competing or contraindicating business models exist side by side all over the place. (Vegas has family friendly entertainments in some of the casinos, after all.) So, no biggie IMO. They do their thing and you do yours.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nThey made a decision about their business that didn't pan out....and then stood by that decision for too long to back away from it. Obviously the people who wanted a pet-free 21+ environment spend less money than those patrons who want a family friendly spot. (They'd likely have been ok if they hadn't banished families on weekends and had,   instead,  made it 21+ Wednesday-Friday since family outings are more frequently on weekends and child-free folks are more likely than parents to be able to go out on a Thursday night)\n\n You filled the void with what sounds like a really fun place to be. You are not wrong for adding an ,apparently, greatly desired element to your community.", "NTA\n\nThis is sour grapes on their part. They made a decision to treat their situation in a way that caused a downturn in their business.\n\nYou saw an opportunity and acted on it and made sure to create an environment and process that would allow for families.\n\nJust use care to make sure you protect yourself because people can be violent. \n\nYou might review your finances and maybe even buy them out with an eye to capturing both markets (you cannibalize yourself for maximum benefit that way - does not matter which they go to as it is all yours.)", "NTA. Absolutely NTA. The entire point of a business is to fulfill consumers\u2019 needs and wants. You\u2019re filling a gap in the market that they chose to leave wide open. If the market can handle two similar businesses with slightly different approaches, you\u2019ll both do fine. If it can\u2019t, the one the consumers gravitate toward more will prevail. They should be asking themselves \u201chow can I make my business more appealing than Dan\u2019s?\u201d And if customers want it that bad, they need to speak with their dollars, not their abusive phone calls.", "NTA.
