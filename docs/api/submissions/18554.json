I live in the Midwest which is where this has taken place. \n\n\rLast year a local family friendly brewery announced they would no longer be as family friendly. In the past, parents could go and eat and have a drink while the kids played outside. Enough Patrons complained about the kids and dogs being off the leash that the business changed their practices. Weekends were for 21+ only and no animals allowed. The blow back online was large, but the crowd who were for this were even louder, so I assumed they would be alright. \n\n\rI only noticed this because I own the land next to them and follow their page. My friend was a brewer already and I specialize in children\u2019s playground equipment, so after a conversation and noticing the opportunity, we took the necessary steps to open a family friendly brewery with a dog park.  \n\n\rParents eat and have a drink while their kids play in our area, and pet owners have a open space too. At times the pet owners can have a seat while kids provide fun and entertainment for the pets by playing fetch and just being kids. \n\n\rTo say we have found a lot of success would be an understatement. Parents, kids, grandparents, and tag-a- longs keep us busy practically all day. We will likely have to expand this Summer. \n\n\rThe issue is the neighboring brewery is not doing well at all. They have had to downsize, and it is looking more and more like they will have to close the doors. I have spoken to someone who knows a bit about the business, and he claimed they alienated to much of their reliable clients and have been unable to win them back. \n\n\rI have gotten a few angry emails from patrons about this as this brewery is the only one in the area where people can go that isn\u2019t a bar or club. People have said some pretty nasty things about me and my business partner, and at times I feel they have a point. \n\n\rWas I wrong to open next to them and take advantage of the situation?", "created_utc": 1685460025, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/13vt5b8/aita_for_opening_up_a_family_friendly_brewery/", "score": 1787, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

They decided to cut off their clientele, and you found a niche to fill. What you should do is buy the neighboring brewery and have a 21+ section and a family friendly section (if the rent/overhead isn't too much).", "Questions of AH vs non AH rise to a whole different level when you are talking about business.  For example, AH behavior would be falsely swatting them, posting fake reviews, suing them with no basis just to drain their funds, naming your bar something similar enough to be confused, etc.  \n\nBut opening a business to serve a group that they chose to abandon?  Just common sense.  Unless the neighbors were the ones complaining about kids and pets unsupervised in their yards, tNTA.", "NTA: They made a bad business call and created a void in the local landscape for a family-friendly brewery. You simply filled in that missing place. They fucked themselves over. If it weren't you, it would have been someone else. The need was there, clearly. You aren't responsible for someone else's bad business decision.", "NTA.  The customers have spoken.  Not OP's fault the place next door chose a business model that wasn't able to keep them open.  Guess all those loud people who complained weren't a significant enough portion of the customer base to cater the business to.", "NTA\n\nThe customers who are making your business successful are the exact customers that this business *didn't* want and specifically prohibited from the premises. If they weren't going to your brewery they'd still be going somewhere else and the 21+ place would still be struggling.", "NTA.\n\nSounds like most people like your kid and dog friendly brewpub, and not many people like their adult-only offering.\n\nYour neighbor may offer the only adult-only facility in the area that isn't a bar or club, and he may have a small number of vocal customers who want that, but there don't seem to be many of them - not nearly enough people to keep him in business.", "NTA \n\nI don\u2019t live in the Midwest. I live in a small city on the beach was a crazy amount of local businesses. I could be wrong when I say this, but I\u2019m ignorant until I learn lol. \n\nIn my city there\u2019s so many local businesses all next to each other and all doing pretty well minus a couple that don\u2019t make it sometimes. There\u2019s like 6 bars next to each other downtown- they all do well because they all offer their own unique experience. But when things change in a business that drastically, it\u2019s high risk. It can be high reward, but you need to be smart about it (which they weren\u2019t, considering you live in the Midwest and it seems like there\u2019s more families than partying scenes). We\u2019ve had some bars change over time, but they do it slowly so as not to scare away regular customers. After all, regular customers are the bread and butter. \n\nThey made a risky business move and alienated customers. You wanted to create a business and did it in a smart way that didn\u2019t cost you too much it sounds like.

How I wish this place was near us. It sounds amazing.\n\nNice work tapping into your market needs!", "NTA They made their choices. They decided to cater to the angry patrons who wanted things to be a certain way. Your brewery just as easily could have failed. Their place probably would have been in trouble anyway.

Good luck going forward!", "NTA - if they were still there and you were directly competing for the exact same clientele, there might be some fuzziness, but they vacated that role and you picked it up.

They both suit different demographics but instead of competing against each other, they learned to coexist and promote each other. The bar proudly has one or two of the brewery's IPAs on tap and if you order food from the bar while at the brewery, you get a discount. \n\nNope. The brewery cut off their nose to spite their face. Not your fault that their business decision came back to bite them on the ass, and that their patrons who supported them are no where to be seen.", "NTA - They FAFO. They decided to listen to what was most likely a small but very vocal aspect of their customers and lost the majority of their main customers. You looked at the market and realized you could provide a service that people wanted. Do not listen to the nasty things, as they are upset that they miscalculated, and the patrons who liked it because it's not a bar or club, are probably the ones who complained about the kids and dogs, so they only have themselves to blame.", "Nta.  The bar didn\u2019t want to be family and pet friendly anymore, they would have lost that business whether you opened up or not.  That\u2019s kind of how it goes when you alienate half your clients.  \nWhat made them successful was that there were no other options for brewery\u2019s where you can bring your pets and kids, now they are just like every other bar, and they are competing with every other bar for business.  They really should have thought that out before catering to their whiney regulars and tanking their business to make them happy.", "NTA, it's just business, they shouldn't have made the decisions they made and they're trying to blame you for something that isn't your fault to make themselves feel better about their failing business. It's not like you stole their clients, they literally kicked them out, and then acted all confused that people stopped coming.", "NTA. You gave the people what they needed.", "NAH business is business. You made a business decision and so did the neighboring brewery. It could be in addition to the playground etc, your beer and food is better or you have friendlier service. They can just as easily improve something to attract 21+ customers as you can improve something to attract families. Restaurant business is competitive, you have to stay on your toes to keep your customers loyal.", ">I have gotten a few angry emails from patrons about this\n\nI don't understand this part. Customers of the 21+ brewery are sending you angry emails because you opened a family friendly brewery next to them and thus families aren't going to that place anymore which will lead them to close the place ?\n\nIs that right ?", "NTA they made a decision and you made one. That's how life is", "Establishments with competing or contraindicating business models exist side by side all over the place. (Vegas has family friendly entertainments in some of the casinos, after all.) So, no biggie IMO. They do their thing and you do yours.\n\nNTA.", "NTA.\n\nThey made a decision about their business that didn't pan out....and then stood by that decision for too long to back away from it. Obviously the people who wanted a pet-free 21+ environment spend less money than those patrons who want a family friendly spot. (They'd likely have been ok if they hadn't banished families on weekends and had,   instead,  made it 21+ Wednesday-Friday since family outings are more frequently on weekends and child-free folks are more likely than parents to be able to go out on a Thursday night)\n\n You filled the void with what sounds like a really fun place to be. You are not wrong for adding an ,apparently, greatly desired element to your community.", "NTA\n\nThis is sour grapes on their part. They made a decision to treat their situation in a way that caused a downturn in their business.\n\nYou saw an opportunity and acted on it and made sure to create an environment and process that would allow for families.\n\nJust use care to make sure you protect yourself because people can be violent. \n\nYou might review your finances and maybe even buy them out with an eye to capturing both markets (you cannibalize yourself for maximum benefit that way - does not matter which they go to as it is all yours.)", "NTA. Absolutely NTA. The entire point of a business is to fulfill consumers\u2019 needs and wants. You\u2019re filling a gap in the market that they chose to leave wide open. If the market can handle two similar businesses with slightly different approaches, you\u2019ll both do fine. If it can\u2019t, the one the consumers gravitate toward more will prevail. They should be asking themselves \u201chow can I make my business more appealing than Dan\u2019s?\u201d And if customers want it that bad, they need to speak with their dollars, not their abusive phone calls.", "NTA.

I\u2019d be worried about that as well.", "I don\u2019t disagree, would never take my dog to a dog park..but I think the difference in dog friendly breweries and a park is there is a staff at the brew to tell ah dogs and owners to leave", "The man owned the property and is free to do what he wants with it within the confines of local laws and codes. Wild that you think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.", "I mean that's just how businesses work. Have you never been to an outdoor mall with a Nike shop and an Underarmor shop? Or seen two restaurants in a mall food court?", "They needed a child friendly bar? LMAO", "NTA. \n\nYeah, the problem isn't that OP is fulfilling a market niche that their competitor abandoned, it's that their competitor failed to realize that their market niche wasn't a big enough demographic to make up the cost of alienating the other market niche, and then failed to pivot and find a new market niche when their business started struggling.", "finally a comment that makes sense, this whole situation is so bizarre to me. unless they primarily serve food, businesses that serve alcohol should aim to be childfree spaces, for both adults to enjoy an adult-only space as well as for the safety of children.", "not the alcoholics downvoting this \ud83d\ude2d", "i think they meant it\u2019s the only adult-only space that isn\u2019t a bar or a club.", "i think they meant it\u2019s the only adult-only space that isn\u2019t a bar or a club.", "Especially if op offered to onboard the staff there so no one has to lose their jobs.", "Literally was thinking the same thing.  I believe this is called a \"business opportunity\"!", "Why would you work with someone who sabotaged their own business and then harasses you for filling the void they left?", "The costs of an adjoining property would be much lower.  Possibly one kitchen, one brew station.  It could make fantastic sense.", "Agree! All these \u201cthey fucked around and found out and cut them no slack\u201d comments don\u2019t understand how this all works.", "Even allowing kids to run around is a liability. I worked at a brewery with a large outdoor space, and we had a server get badly hurt when some kids kicked a soccer ball into her while she was carrying a tray of glasses. \n\nHaving dogs and kids running around unattended seems like an eventual recipe for disaster.", "This is always the balancing act with kids. The bookstore I work for (so even more naturally a kid friendly place than a brewery to begin with), has had to carefully pull back on some amenities, especially kid friendly ones, because of the potential legal hazards. It\u2019s such a pain in the ass to balance potential consistent loss in business vs loss in products they destroy + the ever looming potential of one very big lawsuit.\n\nAll it takes is one negligent parent or owner to wreck a business, but without taking some of those risks  the business might never start to throve in the first place. I do feel bad for the other place since it sounds like the liability risks were getting a bit too high and essentially forced them into destroying their own business. Hopefully OP doesn\u2019t face the same as time goes on.", "If you're talking about the Kihei and the Lahaina locations, I totally agree! The atmosphere in Kihei is fun and exciting, all types of people and even chicken running around. Lahaina is more like a bar, much smaller and more subdued. Their bar made of ice is super cool, but pretty much everything about Kihei is far better!", "Adult only barcades are top tier bars \ud83e\udd0c\ud83c\udffb WA has amazing barcades that California just can\u2019t recreate the same", "I never said it wouldn't happen but in this case OP is an active participant and asks for advice, that it's something common doesn't make it good", "Lmao dude he opened his brewery in the same fucking building as an already open brewery specifically to walk back a rule change they made. Notice how it is another brewery but now in his post he refers to it as a \u201c21 and older bar\u201d to make it seem less like \u201cI opened the exact same business next door to an existing one and got it shut down am I the asshole?\u201d", "Exactly, the entire thing is just ridiculous\u2026 if you want a beer with your food go to a regular restaurant, don\u2019t bring damn kids to a brewery", "I just don't get it. Take your kids to somewhere they can do something. What's the point of taking them to a brewery?\n\nI don't really see how a brewery is any different from a bar, in this aspect. Yet it's a big nono to take your kids to a bar. But not a brewery, apparently.", "The real AH there are the parents that wanted to get hammered while ignoring their kids.\n\nEvery bar I used to frequent would 86 any patron damaging bar property, and kick out anyone who wouldn't stop screaming. If I owned an establishment like this I'd have the same rules for the kids but make their parents also guilty for whatever their kids did. Fuck up trivia night? You and your kid can go. Your kid spill a drink on Ms. Pac Man and walk away like nothing happened? Congrats, neither of you can come back here until you pay for a new Ms. Pac Man.", "Oh man it\u2019s always wild when a place just loses its competitive advantage like that. Changes certainly can be good, unless a change makes you the same as everywhere else and makes you lose all your regulars, and I\u2019d think places would think more about that before just making big changes.", "Brilliant! This is how you make good with literally everybody.", "It's unfortunately very common. I've spoken with MULTIPLE different owners and they all wish the community could come together more to support each other, but fighting for room on our gov. Controlled liquor and beer shelves has become far more important. I see tonnes of local businesses doing collaborative projects and working with each other on events... Except for them.", "Yeah but the liability surrounding random kids and dogs playing together in your business makes me a hard no on combining the two.", "Yep! That\u2019s it! I live in Lahaina. My family actually spent Mother\u2019s Day at the Kihei location. It\u2019s so nice there.", "Umm, no?\n\nThe brewery next door is 21+, there's isn't. They aren't making it seem like the same business, they're making it seem like they opened a family friendly bar next to a 21+ bar\n\nIt also doesn't matter if it's in the same building or near it or whatever. It's business. If the other one fails, it's because they didn't do as good as giving the community what they wanted. \n\nThere's also no issue with taking advantage of a rule the brewery next door made. They're taking advantage of a demand in a specific area, that's how business works\n\nThe only thing you're managing to say is a bunch of word salad for \"Free business: bad\"", "So they can do something while the parents relax. It literally says in the post kids play in the area while parents relax \n\nIt also isn't a no-no to take kids to bars? I've been in bars since I was young. My parents do their thing and I do mine", "Yea it was really unfortunate because management told the staff they weren't allowed to say anything to the parents. I found that out after one kid literally ran into me and I told off the parents.", "A few places in my hometown have done it and it baffles me. You can't recommend a restaurant anymore because they're basically all the same, similar menus and genuinely have some of the same staff. Bars and pubs are the same. Look the same, sound the same, same prices, same atmosphere. \n\nGrowing up the locals I knew used to go out for a pint regularly and go for dinner every other week or so. Saw a bunch of them last time I was back and got talking about where was good to go for dinner and not one of them had been out for a pint or dinner in town this year, with a good number saying they hadn't been out since before 2020. Simply put, there's no point, so why spend the money.", "In theory it's how it's supposed to work but it also invites a whole lot of rich assholes to the party", "Family friendly and bar already don\u2019t mix. It\u2019s highly irresponsible to bring your kids to a brewery and drive home, and it\u2019s a nuisance to everyone else. People that do it truly blow my mind how stupid they are.", "Admittedly I'm not a bar person, but I've never seen kids at one.\n\nAnd I think it's just a difference of opinion. Kids can go do something, and parents can relax, elsewhere.\n\nBut imo I generally speaking, think of bars and breweries as no kids area.\n\nNow, a place like OPs, where it was designed from the ground up to be family friendly, thats different.\n\nBut places not like that, just your typical brewery, I kinda think that should be a no kid zone by default.", "Yeah, I can\u2019t imagine this happening at my favorite bar/arcade (Barcade in Williamsburg Brooklyn, idk if it\u2019s even there anymore, I moved away over a decade ago). That place was a labor of love though. The owners loved beer and old arcade cabinets and did the maintenance themselves. They\u2019d have sooner quit the business than let some kids ruin the experience they\u2019d carefully built.", "Yep. I've also seen some bots that reply to bots' comments, and the comment just says something stupid like \"10/10\" or \"100% this\" but the comment history and username all point to it being a bot too. Be wary of those kinds of comments too.", "Yes, they do mix. They already exist\n\nAnd how is it irresponsible? Lots of bars and breweries offer sodas and other drinks for the kids, and there's often more than one adult. As long as one doesn't drink too much, there's no issj\n\nAnd if it was a nuisance to everyone else, the business would've failed since nobody would want to go. But clearly people want it, so it isn't a nuisance\n\nSo how are people that do it stupid? Because you clewelt have no clue how business or people work. You're basking everhhting off of what your narrow-minsed opinions are. You're the stupid one", "Then you'd know that the patrons OP gained were lost to the neighbor competitor regardless. The only thing that changed was them seeing where the client\u00e8le they abandoned ended up taking their business. A 21+brewery is just about the dumbest thing I've ever heard of. They should have known better.", "But why is it his responsibility to fix their business? They made the decision to go and stay 21+\n\nWhy haven\u2019t they gone back? I just don\u2019t understand how their poor decision making is his fault or responsibility?", "Or you can think logically and think it should be up to the business", "Tragically this was a suburb of Toledo, Ohio.", "Happy to report: Still there and still fun!", "So, we had a few \u201cbeer vacations\u201d before kids where we tried most of the breweries in our state plus 50 or so more from three other states. It gave us a good idea for what the scene was like in a lot of places. Some breweries are barely welcoming to adults and some are super family friendly. Most are somewhere in the middle. \n\nI\u2019m just so excited because we haven\u2019t been able to go in a while due to our lack of travel during the pandemic and we are traveling to that area in a few weeks.
