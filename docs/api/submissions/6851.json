We moved to his home city to be nearer to his extended family. He has a dozen cousins our age in the area, plus aunts, uncles. His extended family, \"The Johnsons\" are his main social life, and they are always throwing. For context, our wedding of 150 people was about 50% Johnson by blood or marriage, and those fuckers could dance. \n\nI work in a field with long hours. I ended up having to work 5 consecutive overnight shifts with the last one ending Thanksgiving morning. We had explicitly talked about doing a 2-person meal, as his family was having a 2 day thanksgiving extravaganza out of town Friday through Sunday. It was unusual for me not to be cooking, as I usually spend Thanksgiving in the kitchen for hours while Carl watches TV. For context, I do all of the cooking in the house. My husband does all of the cleaning, laundry, shopping etc, but he would eat frozen burgers every meal if it weren\u2019t for me. \n\nThree days before thanksgiving, when I was blearily waking up at sunset for work, he informed me sheepishly that he had accidentally invited another seven relatives for dinner. Apparently, it had started as just one person, but in typical Johnson fashion, it snowballed. Carl assured me that we would do low key potluck, and I didn\u2019t have to prepare anything. But this would be the first time I would be hosting anything in our new house, and my first Thanksgiving with most of these people.  Despite his assurances, given the extravagant parties the Johnsons throw and the fact that I had bragged about being a great cook to them all, I had to cook *something* if this was going to be my first time throwing a Johnson event as a newly minted Johnson. \n\nI ended up getting home at 8am Thanksgiving Day after a grueling shift and got straight to prepping food. I eventually conked out for three hours before I had to start cooking in earnest for the crowd. Carl took care of the booze and all the cleaning.  He insisted I didn\u2019t have to cook, but I told him crankily that I couldn\u2019t host his family for Thanksgivingwithout cooking anything at all! \n\nI ended up having a really good time despite being delirious from lack of sleep, and everyone loved my food, so all\u2019s well that ends well. But I\u2019m still cranky at Carl for springing this on me at the end of a work week, but Carl thinks I could have slept all day and just rolled out of bed and shown up.", "created_utc": 1673205200, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/106rfwh/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_husband_over/", "score": 136, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

The pressure on her as the host family is a lot. He said it was a pot luck; doesn\u2019t sound like anyone else brought any dishes.

And regardless, there are hosting expectations for women that don\u2019t apply to men, especially as a new member of the family. \n\nI think you and Carl need to get on the same page about inviting people over\u2014he may need to learn the phrase \u201clet me run it by SwimmerMission\u201d and you may need to start planning as though you\u2019ll have some company on big holidays regardless of what the original plan is.", "Carl sucks for springing this in you especially when you were exhausted.  A lot of men do not get the pressure that women are on to \u201cperform\u201d with regards to certain things (I.e. hosting parties, child raising and cleaning).

And you did have a really good time, per your own words. And now, more than a month later, you are still being cranky with your husband about thanksgiving. These factors combined lead me to say YTA.

He said you could sleep and not have to cook anything but you chose against it. You wanted to prove how good of a cook you are.
