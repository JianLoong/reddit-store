I wouldn't alienate Jenny - you sound like good friends to one another.", "I don't think being a good human and checking in on another human makes you TA.\n\nNTA", "NTA. Your brother seems to be a major manipulative I\u2019ve AH. Good that Jenny kicked him out! Youcan choose your friends but not your family. You\u2019re not responsible for the break up and you talk to whomever you want so your brother doesn\u2019t have a say in this.", "It\u2019s amazing how people say they will never be like their parents but surprise surprise they turn out to be just like them. NTA, after all like father, like son, what that brother needs is some anger management and therapy not another lady that he may cheat on sooner or later.", "NTA You don't support someone doing something indefensible and blatantly wrong just because you have similar DNA. Be kind to the ex because she's an innocent human being whom someone hurt for no reason.", "ESH.\n\nObviously your brother sucks.\n\nYou should have talked to your brother first, however.  That doesn't mean that you couldn't talk to Jenny or ultimately take her side, but not talking to your brother *first* is an AH move.\n\nAs for alienating Jenny because she's the mother of your nephews?  I suppose that's up to you.  How important is extended family to you?  I mean, I've got three cousins and I couldn't tell you any of their last names and I haven't seen any of them in something like 30 years.  Doesn't bother me in the slightest as extended family was never particularly important to me.", "Info: was she positive that he was using Bumble as a dating app and not Bumble BFF, the app for making friends?", "Info needed: How did you find out about the break up?  \nMore info needed: Are you Chris' brother or sister?", "East coast USA here w/ chronic health issues leading to an unholy number of ER visits...\n\nI always have data and wifi available at hospitals, and I've been to like....10 different ones in the last 3 years.", "Often blocked on the hospital wifi but you can still use cell data\u2014 I did in December", "Not in England", "Having FaceTimed with family members who were in the hospital I can assure you it is not always blocked.", "The fiance Jenny told me", "NTA.

If they're his kids, that makes this even more f'd up.", "Her brother is a deadbeat who went to dating app while his child was on the hospital. He is garbage. Jenny will be on this children's life I doubt OP'S brother will stay.", "It's his kids.", "NTA. Blood relation doesn't mean you're obligated to always side with that person even when they're clearly in the wrong. Kudos to you for prioritizing the reality of the situation here.", "op=NTA\n\n<< *Instead of contacting my brother and talking the situation through*\\>> I'm curious, what talking thru did you expect would make things better?  Was he supposed to have a GOOD reason to make a bumble account while his CHILD is in the hospital and he has a fianc\u00e9?\n\nI think you are in a bad situation since you are \"dead\" to your brother(Did he text you via Ouija board?).  While staying on Jenny's good side so you have access to your nephews isn't bad; you somehow need to find a way to tightrope between these two parents.", "Guest wifi 24/7 with  password posted all over in the facilities I was in all last year.", "Probably true, but there's no evidence that OP bothered to see/hear brother's perspective.  More to the point... Do we even know that he actually installed the app or that's just what his Ex says?  Granted, that's an argument that will quickly devolve into \"who do you trust\" (assuming he's since deleted it from his phone), but you don't convict without at least giving them a chance to deny (and it doesn't sound like OP did)."]}
