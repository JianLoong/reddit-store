It sounds a little weird but it isn\u2019t. My wife has went through some things and one thing she refuses to do is sleep in the same room as someone, the only exception is babies and children. \n\nShe told me from the beginning she trusts me with every fiber of her being but she just cannot do it, of course I didn\u2019t care and I have my own little bat cave where I sleep.\n\nNow here\u2019s where the actual story is. My sister (27F) asked if she could stay over at our house for the weekend because apparently her and her roommate got into an argument. Me and my wife agreed and I told my sister about my wife\u2019s room thing, if you know she\u2019s sleeping don\u2019t go in there. My sister was always kind of a spoiled brat but it really shone here, she complained that the bed in the quest room was to lumpy and she didn\u2019t wanna sleep in my room because of my \u2018man smell\u2019.\n\nAfter all this it was obvious that she would complain about the couch too. I told her my wife\u2019s room was off limits and it was either the options we gave her or she could find a motel. She agreed and everything seemed fine, until I woke up at 3 in the damn morning to my wife yelling along with my sister. When I went to go see what happened, my wife was crying, and my sister was just yelling back. I learned now that my sister sleeps in her underwear, so that made it even worse. I got into the argument and starting yelling at my sister to get her crap and get out. Had one rule and she broke it. Her last statement was calling my wife a crybaby. My wife told me that my sister was trying to sleep in her room, possibly trying to kick her out?\n\nAfter that I got text messages and calls from my parents saying I was a horrible brother for kicking her out like that, and agreeing with her saying that my wife was a crybaby and she should suck it up. Of course I just didn\u2019t listen to it but my wife came to me and starting talking about how I could\u2019ve handled it better, and how  she got texts from my mother saying the same. She said later the same day that she has happy i protected her. Still don\u2019t know why she said that, but it was probably my mother.\n\nThis is really for if I should just apologize and get my parents off my ass.

I am so glad you stuck up for your wife, you obviously are a decent and supportive husband. You do need to say to your mother that she ABSOLUTELY CANNOT message your wife with issues like this - if your mother has a problem with your household, she comes to you to be shut down.

I can't even imagine how scared she must have been, waking up with a barely clothed person in her bed without her knowledge or consent.

Would she climb into bed with them? She obviously wanted to mess with your wife for her unusual sleeping situation.

And I would start and end every conversation about it this way.....  You can try to make this about my wife, but that's a fallacy. We set a boundary. You willfuly disrespected it. Therefore you cannot be trusted. End of. Your refusal to acknowledge and apologize only serves to reinforce that you cannot be trusted to respect boundaries.", "NTA - but your sister is. She had one rule to follow and she broke it. Your sister sounds entitled. Like she doesn't want her own husband sleeping her.

Kicking her out- maybe maybe not. But in the situation- she is an adult and can figure it out.

Why is sister in her room at night?", "NTA \n\nFor better or for worse, when you marry you start a new family unit, one that has to be the priority over everything else or it will fail.

You sound like a thoughtful partner, so you might have considered this already, but it might be helpful to be really gentle with your wife right now, and to let her know that what she experienced was objectively upsetting, and her feelings about it are understandable and natural. \n\n\nYour sister sneaking in (in her underwear?!) was bad enough. And at first, your wife understood that your sister deserved the consequences of her actions, and thanked you for helping her.

They can, and should, be ignored. If she wanted to block them for a while, that would be okay. Because she doesn\u2019t need this noise. \n\nI\u2019m really glad you stood up for her.
