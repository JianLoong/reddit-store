I feel like if I rename him, that\u2019s going to erase the past that they had shared together.  And if feels final, you know.  If Josie had a kid instead, I wouldn\u2019t rename her kid because someone asked me to.  And Newt was her baby.  \n\nOur other friends aren\u2019t happy about this.

I don\u2019t remember anything transphobic, genuinely curious what might have you noticed \n\njust to cast a vote, OP is NTA and I think JK Rowling is vile", "That is so bewildering lol. Here I thought it was a dig at Newt Gingritch.", "I thought the little girl from Aliens\u2026", "Newt is the kid in the Lonesome Dove western series too.", "And the little girl in 'Aliens'.", "Fantastic Beasts\u2026JK Rowling", "....Who's named Newt in Harry Potter? It's been a while.", "I guess I'm too old, my first assumption was that Josie was a big \"Alien\" fan.", "Yeah no it\u2019s a bit ridiculous, coming from a trans person. If someone I don\u2019t know has something that may indicate they\u2019re a Harry Potter fan, I might get a little on edge and wary until I know if they\u2019re safe or not, but Lacey\u2019s behavior is a bit ridiculous esp considering this is their friend who I assume they\u2019ve known for at least a bit and can trust", "Just tell them its for Newt from Aliens.", "A lot of names in HP are pretty normal too, like Harry, Fred, George, Arthur, James, Lily, if we're talking about pet names there'd be even more, like Luna. Someone who knows it better would probably find more", "She is actually a very intelligent person\u2026\n\nAnd right.", "Just pretend it's a reference to a type of amphibian and problem solved", "Also a Harry Potter character, a Good Omens character and a kind of amphibians. My bet is on a HP character, since somebody pointed out he was played by the actor mentioned in the post", "smh so this is all about JK rowling? I understand less and less everyday", "Lol... I'm old.  I do have some awareness of JKR's views/status, but I have never read anything of hers (or seen the movies).  The Aliens reference was the most current I could think of, but my first thought was to say the dog was the guy from Monty Python's Holy Grail...  the one the the \"witch\" turned into a Newt...", "Does she get royalties from dog names or something?  Why would this matter?", "I feel like she gets a lot of hate kind of unjustly.", "Ohh okay. Never watched the fantastic beasts. Thank you.\n\n\nNTA. Still its the pets name and the dog is used to this name", "Newt isn't exclusively associated with JKR. First thing I think when I see the name Newt is the movie Aliens.\n\nDon't rename the dog, it's not a big deal. If people get butthurt over an inoffensive dog's name, that's their problem.", "I mean if the dislike for the name is because of J. K. Rowling why not just associate the name with another character? Like Newt from Maze Runner.", "Ah whoops, I missed that! Will edit my comment with the correct pronouns", "I literally know a nonbinary couple who named their child Newt.", "(sorry I've been watching too much \"Um, Actually\" on dropout tv recently)", "He\u2019s both. He was mentioned in the books as the author of fantastic beasts and where to find them and then she came out with the little book fantastic beasts by him and then expanded on that with the movie series.", "Ohh thank you for this. I couldn\u2019t understand why OPs friends were so offended by the dogs name \ud83d\ude48", "sheesh", "At least Eddie Redmayne has publicly stated that it was a mistake for him to accept the role of Lili Elbe and that she should have been played by a trans actor. Unlike JKR, who continues to spout transphobic garbage.", "It's probably being construed as supporting JK Rowling/Harry Potter and Rowling is a raging transphobe.", "The woke don't like JK Rowling at the moment because she made the heinous suggestion that people that have periods are called women. Apparently you're not allowed to state the obvious anymore for fear of offending the women who can't/don't have periods. No idea why they can't all just be called women, but hey ho. The woke will woke.", "It\u2019s a while since I\u2019ve read them but IIRC Harry Potter is pretty liberally sprinkled with racism and anti-semitism though so let\u2019s not pretend that the primary works are unproblematic.", "I was thinking the amphibian!", "I didn't remember her name.", "The spin-off movies 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them' main character is called Newt Scamander", "Lmao my first thought was the Alien franchise too!", "My first assumption was she liked brewing potions. Eye of Newt and whatnot.", "My first thought as well. We're showing our age here today.", "I'm too older. I assumed Newt Gingrich.", "I guess I'm too young because I've never seen Alien!", "If you really want to pisspeople off , say it was named after Newt Gingrich.", "I thought the same \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23", "Mine are Narcissa and Bellatrix. Which if you want to be pedantic are part of the seven sisters constellation but that\u2019s not where I got them from. I love my little slytherin babies, I would never change their names.", "Lol tell Lacey that Josie was a herpetologist.", "Shhh, this kind of talk isn\u2019t allowed on reddit!", "True. She made the heinous error of pointing out that women who have periods are called women. Not 'people that bleed'. She NEVER said that women who don't/can't have periods should be called anything else. She wasn't hating on the trans community, she was hating on this bizarre narrative that all mention of 'women' should be erased for fear of offending those that chose to become one after birth.", "Hating a transphobe is very justifiable.", "she\u2019s literally donated millions of dollars to hate groups who support conversation therapy. she helped launch an anti-trans group. she\u2019s a bigot, and a *loud* bigot, who has demonstrated a high willingness to use her money and her platform to harm this group of people. \n\nand for what? literally none of her \u201cfears\u201d are real. she *thinks* trans women are going to assault her because they have a body part she doesn\u2019t like very much and that\u2019s enough reason to actively fight against their civil rights? seriously? statistically, trans women are not assaulting people. they\u2019re suffering the highest rates of rape, sexual assault, and murder. \n\nso yes, she gets a lot of hate. but that\u2019s what happens when you put hate into the world and spread lies about a very vulnerable group of people. they obviously want you to stop lying and further endangering them with the spread of those lies. she\u2019s be fine if she stopped lying. nobody would mess with her. but she hates trans people so fucking much she can\u2019t keep quiet about it.", "You\u2019re welcome!", "That seems extreme.  I don't see how a dog's name makes any difference at all, regardless of how people feel about JK Rowling.", "Technically it's \"Alien**s**\", the second movie.", "In the grand scheme of things I don't think she really said anything bigoted or offensive."]}
