My coworkers are predominantly women except for one elderly individual in his 70s. I only recently joined the company a little while ago during a time when everything was done remotely. So all of our meetings, brainstorms, and pow wows were all done on Zoom, and sometimes TeamViewer, when I was first starting out. I did not own a webcam during that time, so I never had video on. During that time, I had become pretty close with all of my coworkers and considered us pretty good work friends at the very least associates who like to chit chat. \n\nHowever, this seemed to almost instantaneously change the moment we started working in the offices AKA in person together. Getting to the workplace, everyone except for the lead and 70 year old man seemed to avoid me. Whenever I spotted everyone gathered around in a conversation and tried to join them, they would immediately disperse, only to come back together a few moments later somewhere else. \n\nThis went on for a few weeks before I finally asked the 70 year old man what was going on. Why is everybody avoiding me. He essentially told me it had to do with how I looked. I'm 5'2ft, balding a bit, and have some weight to me, hearing that was actually pretty discouraging. I've begun dreading going to work, I have stopped trying to interact with anyone unless it has to do with work, and I am always rushing home. Working for this company used to be something I really enjoyed, but now it just brings me nothing but stress and discomfort. I have decided to send my application to a variety of different places and to leave as soon as any of these places except me. I do feel bad since business is starting to pick up, and this is all happening really close to some major deadlines, but I don't think I can take this treatment for much longer", "created_utc": 1678880307, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/11rttfq/aita_for_leaving_the_company_without_telling/", "score": 34, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Their actions are shallow to say the least. Absolutely nail a job and leave; a 2 week notice for a future good reference may serve you well. Consider asking if you can work one or both of your final weeks remotely. Best to you. Thrive!", "NTA. \n\nAre you sure it\u2019s not worth talking to the boss about to try to bring about a change?\n\nIf not, still let them know why you are leaving as the last thing you do before walking out the door to your new job. Maybe they can learn to be better for the next person, or at least understand that the temporary crisis in meeting client needs caused by your leaving is their own damn fault.", "NTA - if you want to leave your job for *any reason* serious or trivial, you don't have to discuss it with anyone in advance , and it's often better not to. Look for another job, accept a job when you get one you think is a good fit, when the offer is secure give the required notice and leave. You don't have to discuss it with anyone, you don't have to give a reason.", "NTA \n\nBut are you sure this is all true? You're taking the word of a single man instead of just asking some of the women. What he says doesn't make allot of sense, why would they avoid you because of your looks at work?", "I worked in a religious non-profit and had to put up with catty middle/aged women cliques on a daily basis. I was neither religious nor middle aged and therefore could only bond over very bland topics as I/them could not relate. We talked about work related topics only. It was a totally miserable and lonely experience. I feel for you, OP. If a place is toxic, and you\u2019re the \u201ccockroach\u201d of the office, and everyone\u2019s avoiding you like the plague\u2026it likely doesn\u2019t matter if you give notice or not. Just make sure to read your signed offer letter/employee contracts/confidentiality agreements/other legal documents to ensure if you do burn that bridge it doesn\u2019t bite you later on or cause other issues. Also, if you can, try to keep this job until you get another, since this market is so weird right now.  Good luck to you!\n\nNTA", "Absolutely NTA if you choose to leave. You've got to look after yourself and this sounds very unhealthy.\n\nI feel for you man. Being bullied or ostracized at work really sucks; whatever the reason but it almost seems worse that it's apparently about your appearance by people who were previous friendly. That seems like a bizarre thing for them to do but some people are just shit.\n\nI think it might be worth talking to the lead to make sure they know what's happening/how you feel and if there's anything else going on. But the sad fact is these things are often hard to change and that's especially going to be true in a small, new business. You absolutely are NTA if you leave, however you do it. I'd certainly be letting them know why you are leaving and how their actions have affected you.", "NTA\n\nThats a toxic environment to be spending your energy and time on. The stress is not worth it ! Also, its absolutely fine to not give any explanation for your departure, especially to a group such as this.\n\nGood luck and hope you find a great place to work at !", "NTA. I assume you\u2019ll let your lead know about leaving and explain your work isolation and low key bullying. You are an able bodied, coherent, hard working guy but their problem is your appearance. That\u2019s not cool.", "NTA - These people are bullies , leave this place", "NTA\n\nBut you should tell them exactly why, guarantee they all think theyre lovely friendly people so put em on blast on your way out.", "NTA your data is currently the words of a 70yo old guy.", "NTA.\n\nI'm so sorry you had to endure it, what those people are doing is despicable. The way those people treated you while working remotely tells you that you are a good co-worker, you did nothing wrong.\n\nMy boyfriend has a similar experience (he's constantly bodyshamed because of his weight and (used to have) acne) and his mental health is suffering greatly because of it. My heart goes out to you and I hope you find a job with a healthy work environment soon.", "NTA. You are allowed to leave a job for any reason you want. And your fellow employee have certainly not given you any reason to stay. You do what you need to do for your mental and professional health. \n\nAs far as the deadlines and increasing work - don\u2019t feel too bad - if they deserved to have you stay, they would have treated you like a human being. Any issues that derive from you leaving they have brought on themselves.", "NTA.. that is a really unfair situation to be in, never feel bad for needing to leave somewhere. I understand not telling anyone because if they ask you why you're leaving you have to basically complain about your coworkers. Good choice deciding to leave", "Absolutely NTA\n\nThat's horrible. These people are bullies. I'm guessing if it's a small start up company there's no HR department. If there was I'd say report it and leave. \n\nI'm sorry you're dealing with these shallow low life's.", "NTA this is discrimination. Leave and find somewhere you feel more comfortable!", "NTA. Give them 2 weeks notice.", "INFO: Do you live in the USA? If not is there a mandatory notice period in the country you live in?", "NTA and what they are doing to you is sexist and if the tables were turned feminists would be walking all over this case. Unfortunately its a much harsher world for men. Hope you find the job you are looking for and no job is worth mental stress if this is what you have to endure on a daily basis. Follow the process, do the right notice period stuff and at least you have the 70 year old gent as a friend, who you can use for references in the future. Just be civil and move on if you have to but don't abscond. It might look bad on you and might be an issue for future potential opportunities.", "ESH\n\nIf you leave employment, you should give the contractual notice period. \n\nYou're going solely off the word of a 70yo man for an explanation. Might not be true.", "^^^^AUTOMOD  ***Thanks for posting! This comment is a copy of your post so readers can see the original text if your post is edited or removed.

I hope your next job doesn't have people like this.", "NTA - What you are experiencing is known as a hostile work environment. If you had a way to document your co-workers \"shunning\" you and the statements of the 70 y/o, then you would have decent grounds for a lawsuit. However, you do not owe this company anything at all. Find another job and give this company a letter stating your immediate resignation. Politely cite the treatment by co-workers and how it made the job unbearable. Also politely let the company owner know that this type of environment will only draw in toxic employees and his business will fail.", "NTA - work is optional.\n\nI usually tell people that you should think about your co-workers and make the transition reasonably easy on them (which is why I think you should give notice and try to be a good friend/employee).  But if you have not relationship and they're not treating you well, you don't owe them a professional courtesy.\n\nFind a different job and move on.  No reason to be unhappy at work.  Only concern is if an abrupt departure damages your resume/reputation, but that's with every departure.\n\nI assure you that if money was tight, they wouldn't hesitate to fire people.", "NTA.\n\nYou're never an asshole for leaving a bad situation, even if the company tries to make you feel like one.\n\nYou are under no obligation to tell anyone you're thinking of leaving.  You might choose to talk to the lead if you think things can get better, but if you are pretty certain this is futile, that's cool too.\n\nI'm sorry about the shitty juvenile treatment.  Like wtf is this, junior high?  I hope you find something you like soon.", "NTA. I\u2019m sorry OP. That sounds awful. Run to somewhere new and be free of the bullying and judgement.", "Unless the contract doesn't have any. And especially if it's an at will state in America, OP really doesn't owe them anything if this is how they're gonna treat him.", "He could also be being overly-sensitive and taking things the wrong way. There could be a completely rational explanation that is entirely unrelated to him.\n\nWithout raising the issue, he is relying on the hearsay of a septuagenarian.", "This response sucks. For one, you\u2019re calling OP overly sensitive when clearly what these ladies are doing is making him uncomfortable and impacting work. Secondly, you\u2019re dismissing the word of another employee because of their age ? (For anyone whos not a pompous ass, septuagenarian means 70-79 years old). OP is NTA. He\u2019s right to leave somewhere if he\u2019s not comfortable or if the work environment is toxic.", "Every single time that OP talked about the old guy, he referenced him by age. That is the only identifier used by the OP, and I am simply continuing that so that we know they individual that we are discussing. \n\nI am questioning that person's \"word\" as hearsay because that's all it is. Unless those other colleagues have directly discussed matters with him (a detail which is not given), then the explanation is purely down to their own assumptions.\n\nAnd there's no need to throw around name-calling just because you don't like someone else's vocabulary usage."]}
