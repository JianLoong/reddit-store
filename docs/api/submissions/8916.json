She\u2019s been married to my dad for 20 years, and for context I\u2019m 23. Last summer they found out they\u2019re pregnant, which everyone (including me) has considered a miracle because of their ages, along with the fact she was told for the past 2 decades she wouldn\u2019t be able to conceive/carry. Not sure what the details were exactly, just that it was likely never to happen.\n\nRecently I started a job at a clinic. It\u2019s my first \u201cbig job,\u201d if you know what I mean. I live 3 hours away from my parents and have for years now, and they were disappointed that I picked up another job in my own city instead of opting to move closer to home, now that I have a sibling in the picture. I understand that they want me around, but I worked my ass off to get this job. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been wanting for years.\n\nA few days ago, on a phone call with my stepmom, she asked me if I would be coming to her baby shower coming up in a week and a half. I said no. Not for any bad reason, just that I won\u2019t be able to take off work for that. She hung up on me mid sentence, and I got a call from my dad a few minutes later. He wanted to know why I couldn\u2019t call out of work just for the day, just for her.\n\nTwo weeks ago I was forced to take several sick days (that I\u2019d only recently been granted, since I haven\u2019t worked here long) after coming down with the flu. My supervisor was a little uptight about it, but it was fine. But, no, I\u2019m not going to use a sick day for a baby shower. \n\nThen, on the call with my dad, he starts to pressure with \u201cWell, baby showers are a huge milestone. They\u2019re a big deal, especially to us.\u201d I said, are they really? I already plan to be present at the birth, even if it means calling out of work no matter the circumstance\u2014I can\u2019t do both, and so I choose the birth to be present at. \n\nI\u2019m not dissing anybody who says baby showers are important, okay? I get it, I do. But to me personally, it feels a little outrageous to be pressured into calling out of my job just to watch my stepmom open up gifts for a baby who isn\u2019t here yet. If it were a weekend, I would absolutely come. And yes, I have gotten gifts meant for the shower. I just didn\u2019t know at the time I purchased them that it would fall on a day I couldn\u2019t make it.\n\nMy dad was extremely agitated with me on the phone when I was explaining everything, and he said I was \u201cletting them both down\u201d by choosing not to come. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s like your sister\u2019s 0 age birthday party.\u201d Like\u2026What? Okay, am I going crazy? Have I been living under a rock not knowing that people take baby showers this seriously? \n\nSorry. I get they\u2019re excited, and they want me to be there. But I actually can\u2019t. And I think it\u2019s for a genuinely good reason, but nobody else seems to think so. I\u2019m really trying to do well here.\n\nNeither of them have returned my texts or calls since the argument. As for responses here, I feel like it\u2019s going to be a mixed bag\u2014but if you say YTA, I want to know what I should have said/done instead.

Remind them that you have booked time off for the birth. No doubt so you can bond with the baby, and so that you can be there for the family as they recover and build a routine with baby. You have priorised that milestone event because that is the part where you feel you will have the bigger impact. You can send gifts for mom & baby for the shower, but with the short notice, you can't attend as it might affect how long you can stay once baby arrives. As a responsible adult, you have to take this into consideration. And as much as you would like to attend, and bond more with your step-mom before the baby is born, you feel she will need your help more after the baby has arrived. \n\nI know some of that may never happen, especially given the state of your relationship with your step mom before the baby. But wouldn't it be nice if, when uou little sibling arrives, that you two bond over the love you both share for the baby?", "NTA. Can they not schedule the baby shower on a Sunday or your birthday days off ?", ">It\u2019s like your sister\u2019s 0 age birthday party\n\nThat's literally what birth is, not the baby shower.\n\nNTA", "NTA for not going, but why on *earth* are you planning to be at the birth? Did she ask you to?", "One and a half week notice in advance\u2026naaahh\u2026fuck that\u2026NTA", "A shower on a week day when a lot of people work.   Seems like not a good idea unless you want to be very selective on who shows up.   It is a baby shower, not a command performance.   Don\u2019t let them keep harping on this.   You told them you were unable to attend, and that is the end of it.  If they call to \u201cdiscuss\u201d tell them the subject is closed.  Baby\u2019s \u201c0 birthday\u201d.  Hahahahahahahahaha", "NTA They planned it for a regular business day?!?! Like a Thursday or Friday and expected people to come?!?!? You're definitely not the only person who has to work. Holy hell the entitlement. NTA OP, not at all.", "NTA this is why you don\u2019t plan stuff like this during the week. People have jobs and their own responsibilities!!", "NTA - its not a command performance.  People who hold 'Give me Gift' events can't expect everybody they know to show up for every event with fancy expensive presents.\n\nThere will be a Christening and presumably you'll be expected to be there for that and pony up a gift.  \n\nIt sounds like they want you as involved as they are.  You are peripheral to this event!  \n\nFor your step mother, who probably is all maternal and happy, its a big deal but it shouldn't be a big deal to the world in general.  You have your own life.  Dont let them start roping you into baby sitting", "NTA. You've recently gotten a job and they expect you to call out for a baby shower? They're ridiculous. Set boundaries now because they don't respect you and will demand you call out yo babysit.\n\nDon't call out for the birth. That isn't normal. Your parents want you close to them so they have a free babysitter", "NTA. It's fine that they're excited about their miracle baby but a baby shower is exactly what you described--watching a woman or couple open a bunch of gifts and maybe having refreshments. Not something that would demand you call out from work. And if they truly wanted you there,  why wouldn't they have held it on a weekend which is more convenient for most people.", "NTA- If they plan an event on a weekday they can\u2019t upset when people can\u2019t make it because of work.", "NTA. If you being there was so important it would be a day you could be present such as a weekend. To expect you to be irresponsible and just not work and risk a job you so want is inconsiderate at best. \n\nTruth behind it I feel is stepmom has always been jealous of you in the sense that your father has a kid and she couldn\u2019t and now that she is pregnant she expects everyone to care as much as her. She especially wants you there because she will feel more self satisfaction that she now has a kid with your father. It\u2019s utter selfish entitled bullshit", "NTA. And it\u2019s not even on the weekend?!? Tell them if your presence is that important they will have it on a normal time. I\u2019ve never heard of a baby shower during the work week.", "Seriously. Also, the fact that they got upset that OP didn't move back to their town makes me think they are expecting free childcare.", "Uh my friend works just weekends and planned hers durning the week. Nothing wrong with that", "NTA. Baby showers are not important and to be honest,", "Sure but most people work weekdays - these people are annoyed at OP for not taking a day off\u2026\u2026make your party on a weekday and accept people may not make it instead of harassing them\u2026.. the step mother is acting like a spoilt brat", "Shift workers exist, we count! But still, no matter when you schedule and event you have to understand that people might not be able to come. If it's really important that a specific person be there check when that person is available before scheduling!", "Yeah... sadly despite all efforts, mental health is still not taken very seriously and it's honestly irritating.  We are perfectly willing to accept what we can see (wheelchair for example... although some people still find ways to be a d*ck about that) but if we can't see it? Too bad... I've even heard people claim a person they knew were lying about cancer because they \"didn't look sick\" (which,  working in a cancer clinic... yeah that set me off pretty good.)\n\nPeople are f*cked up.", ">She hung up on me mid sentence\n\nReason enough to not go. NTA.", "NTA\n\nWho the hell plans a baby shower in a weekday? The parents are being ridiculous", "NTA\n\nThere's no reason to have it on a weekday or expect you to miss work. \n\nEntirely bizarre.\n\nIf it's so important for you to be there, have it on a day you can attend.", "NTA. They both obviously think it's important to share this with you. They're just being jerks about why you can't go. Your job is important and you are still the new person. Instead of you taking a day off make a plan with stepmom and dad on a day you already have off and have a little lunch baby shower. Give your gift (socks are always good in various sizes, stupid things always disappear) and celebrate with them on your new baby brother or sister. BTW it's awesome you plan to be around for the birth", "NTA. Let's say you did call out of work. Then someone takes a whole bunch of photos of you at a party, puts them online, your boss sees, and now you're fired. \n\nAre they going to house and support you with a new baby? You're not going to have a good reference, so it will take a while to get a new job. \n\nDo the actual grown up thing and be responsible enough to stay at your job. If they wanted you there so badly they should have checked in *before* they planned the date.", "NTA", "Who the hell holds a baby shower on a weekday? NTA", "I totally get the vibe they will expect you to come to their home every weekend to help babysit NTA", "NTA why on earth would they plan the shower on a weekday? Do none of their friends or other family work?", "NTA. You don't even need a reason not to go, but you have a solid one (and you even got gifts already!). You're handling this right and your dad and step mom are all wrong, especially the part where they keep trying to act like this is something for your future sister (\"huge milestone,\" \"0 age birthday party\"). Baby showers are for the parent(s). Not that it matters, because badgering someone for declining an invitation is an AH move anyway, but if you being there would actually benefit or affect the baby in some way, I might cut them a little more slack. And I'd also feel a little more sympathetic if they were honest about why they're upset with you (it's important TO THEM and they hoped you'd celebrate with them). You'd still be right and they'd still be wrong, but it's this \"but your SISTER!!!!!\" BS that puts them really over the top of the AH cutoff.", "NTA.  It's not your baby shower and your presence shouldn't be mandatory. New job, three-hours away, and you've already missed days due to illness.  Ask them if they'll pay your bills after you're fired?", "NTA \n\nWhy on earth would she pick a weekday??? That excludes so many people. I wouldn't take a day off of work for anyone's shower regardless.", "NTA\nHaving a baby on a week day is insane", "NTA", "NTA. Do they think you're the only person who is going to have a problem with a weekday baby shower? Do your parents friends and family not work?", "Totally NTA. Now, I don't know if OP would want to move closer. With this level of entitlement the stepmother and father have, I'd see them pressuring OP to babysit ALOT. \"We are so tired\", \"We need time as a couple\", \"You have all weekend to help and you should because FaMiLy!!!\"  LOL. Don't over extend yourself after the baby is born OP. You deserve to live the life you want too while still maintaining the relationship that you will want with this child. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f", "NTA. I get that they\u2019re excited, but their unborn child is not the center of the universe for other people", "My husband has a half brother that is 22 years younger than him.  We found out that his step mom was pregnant during our wedding reception.  My husband has no relationship with his brother.  Not that he doesn't care about him... it's just that there is too much of an age gap and we were already married and starting our own lives by the time he was born.  We're now in our 40's and half brother just turned 21.  There is just nothing in common.  My FIL really pushed for a close relationship but my husband just had other things going on and it started to feel like his dad and step mom were just looking for babysitters.  We weren't ready for kids and we absolutely weren't going to raise someone elses."]}
