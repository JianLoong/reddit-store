She\u2019s been married to my dad for 20 years, and for context I\u2019m 23. Last summer they found out they\u2019re pregnant, which everyone (including me) has considered a miracle because of their ages, along with the fact she was told for the past 2 decades she wouldn\u2019t be able to conceive/carry. Not sure what the details were exactly, just that it was likely never to happen.\n\nRecently I started a job at a clinic. It\u2019s my first \u201cbig job,\u201d if you know what I mean. I live 3 hours away from my parents and have for years now, and they were disappointed that I picked up another job in my own city instead of opting to move closer to home, now that I have a sibling in the picture. I understand that they want me around, but I worked my ass off to get this job. It\u2019s what I\u2019ve been wanting for years.\n\nA few days ago, on a phone call with my stepmom, she asked me if I would be coming to her baby shower coming up in a week and a half. I said no. Not for any bad reason, just that I won\u2019t be able to take off work for that. She hung up on me mid sentence, and I got a call from my dad a few minutes later. He wanted to know why I couldn\u2019t call out of work just for the day, just for her.\n\nTwo weeks ago I was forced to take several sick days (that I\u2019d only recently been granted, since I haven\u2019t worked here long) after coming down with the flu. My supervisor was a little uptight about it, but it was fine. But, no, I\u2019m not going to use a sick day for a baby shower. \n\nThen, on the call with my dad, he starts to pressure with \u201cWell, baby showers are a huge milestone. They\u2019re a big deal, especially to us.\u201d I said, are they really? I already plan to be present at the birth, even if it means calling out of work no matter the circumstance\u2014I can\u2019t do both, and so I choose the birth to be present at. \n\nI\u2019m not dissing anybody who says baby showers are important, okay? I get it, I do. But to me personally, it feels a little outrageous to be pressured into calling out of my job just to watch my stepmom open up gifts for a baby who isn\u2019t here yet. If it were a weekend, I would absolutely come. And yes, I have gotten gifts meant for the shower. I just didn\u2019t know at the time I purchased them that it would fall on a day I couldn\u2019t make it.\n\nMy dad was extremely agitated with me on the phone when I was explaining everything, and he said I was \u201cletting them both down\u201d by choosing not to come. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s like your sister\u2019s 0 age birthday party.\u201d Like\u2026What? Okay, am I going crazy? Have I been living under a rock not knowing that people take baby showers this seriously? \n\nSorry. I get they\u2019re excited, and they want me to be there. But I actually can\u2019t. And I think it\u2019s for a genuinely good reason, but nobody else seems to think so. I\u2019m really trying to do well here.\n\nNeither of them have returned my texts or calls since the argument. As for responses here, I feel like it\u2019s going to be a mixed bag\u2014but if you say YTA, I want to know what I should have said/done instead.
