{"id": 5437, "submission_id": "ztg77h", "title": "AITA for naming my child Eddie-Munson", "selftext": "So some backstory. I (28 F) married my husband (32 M) 3 years ago. We met 5 years ago at comic con after both leaving a rough relationship. I was dressed as Nancy and he was dressed as Steve (both from Stranger Things) so it was like we were made for each other. \n\nFast forward to 9 months ago I found out I was pregnant with my baby girl after being told I couldn\u2019t conceive by many doctors. We were overjoyed as we have always wanted kids of our own and didn\u2019t want to go through the adoption process. \n\nDuring my pregnancy I binged alot of TV, and me and my husband rewatched Stranger Things and I really got into it again as the new season was almost out. I was already planning to name my baby after one of the characters, since it had such a huge impact in our relationship. Only my husband and best friend knew about this and they endlessly supported me. \n\nWhen season 4 eventually came out I instantly fell in love with the new character Eddie. I loved his goofy vibe and altogether, I thought he was pretty attractive too. My little sister (16 F) also fell in love with him and Joseph Quinn (The actor). \n\nShe fell ill a few years back, earlier this year it got a little better but then got way worse. In August she passed. My entire family was there when she died, including my husband and I. Her last words were \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you Eddie Munson\u201d This made my Mother extremely upset stating \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even love her family enough, all she cares about is that stupid show\u201d She started to distance herself from me since I got my sister into Stranger Things. \n\nThe name Eddie Munson suddenly came to me. I had wanted to name my child something from Stranger Things but I couldn\u2019t figure out what and it was a nice way to honour my sister. When I told my Husband he tried to convince me otherwise but eventually he gave in. He had told me to just name our kid Eddie or Eds or something like that but I insisted on the full Eddie Munson. \n\nTime passed and I was in labor. The gender was a mystery to everyone so we didn\u2019t know until birth. When the baby was finally born, it was a beautiful baby girl. I hadn\u2019t thought to change the name to a female name. I still insisted with Eddie Munson. My husband and entire family told me to name her after my deceased  grandmother , or Lily after my sister. I insisted no because I wanted it to be from Stranger Things and my little sister would\u2019ve wanted it. \n\nI signed the birth certificate and named her Eddie-Munson (all one name). \n\nMy husband was enraged, as was his mother and my whole family and he went to Seattle to stay with his sister for I don\u2019t know how long because I \u201cdisrespected him as a parent\u201d.\n\nThey are now telling me my baby is going to get bullied and sending me bad messages. I don\u2019t think I made a mistake honouring my sister and I think that everyone else is being disrespectful about my decision as her mother.\n\nAITA? Or is my husband and family all overacting.", "created_utc": 1671803874, "permalink": "/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ztg77h/aita_for_naming_my_child_eddiemunson/", "score": 102, "replies": ["Welcome to /r/AmITheAsshole.

Straight guys and lesbians are going to be put off by a girl with a man's name. What are you thinking??? Your poor child.

I (28 F) married my husband (32 M) 3 years ago. We met 5 years ago at comic con after both leaving a rough relationship. I was dressed as Nancy and he was dressed as Steve (both from Stranger Things) so it was like we were made for each other. \n\nFast forward to 9 months ago I found out I was pregnant with my baby girl after being told I couldn\u2019t conceive by many doctors. We were overjoyed as we have always wanted kids of our own and didn\u2019t want to go through the adoption process. \n\nDuring my pregnancy I binged alot of TV, and me and my husband rewatched Stranger Things and I really got into it again as the new season was almost out. I was already planning to name my baby after one of the characters, since it had such a huge impact in our relationship. Only my husband and best friend knew about this and they endlessly supported me. \n\nWhen season 4 eventually came out I instantly fell in love with the new character Eddie. I loved his goofy vibe and altogether, I thought he was pretty attractive too. My little sister (16 F) also fell in love with him and Joseph Quinn (The actor). \n\nShe fell ill a few years back, earlier this year it got a little better but then got way worse. In August she passed. My entire family was there when she died, including my husband and I. Her last words were \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see you Eddie Munson\u201d This made my Mother extremely upset stating \u201cShe doesn\u2019t even love her family enough, all she cares about is that stupid show\u201d She started to distance herself from me since I got my sister into Stranger Things. \n\nThe name Eddie Munson suddenly came to me. I had wanted to name my child something from Stranger Things but I couldn\u2019t figure out what and it was a nice way to honour my sister. When I told my Husband he tried to convince me otherwise but eventually he gave in. He had told me to just name our kid Eddie or Eds or something like that but I insisted on the full Eddie Munson. \n\nTime passed and I was in labor. The gender was a mystery to everyone so we didn\u2019t know until birth. When the baby was finally born, it was a beautiful baby girl. I hadn\u2019t thought to change the name to a female name. I still insisted with Eddie Munson. My husband and entire family told me to name her after my deceased  grandmother , or Lily after my sister. I insisted no because I wanted it to be from Stranger Things and my little sister would\u2019ve wanted it. \n\nI signed the birth certificate and named her Eddie-Munson (all one name). \n\nMy husband was enraged, as was his mother and my whole family and he went to Seattle to stay with his sister for I don\u2019t know how long because I \u201cdisrespected him as a parent\u201d.\n\nThey are now telling me my baby is going to get bullied and sending me bad messages. I don\u2019t think I made a mistake honouring my sister and I think that everyone else is being disrespectful about my decision as her mother.\n\nAITA? Or is my husband and family all overacting.\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you feel the overwhelming need to use that name, get a dog!!!!!", "YTA. Everyone pretty much agrees that baby names are supposed to be two yeses, one no.
